What if I
I wanna kiss you tomorrow

Something tells me
You're not like the other boys
Oh no babe
Oh no babe, hmm
Of course I like you
Can't you hear it in my voice?
Oh yeah babe
Oh yeah babe
Well, don't be nervous, I'm so into you
Yes I am babe
Is this is something?
Am I just a fool?

What if I, I wanna kiss you tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow?
'Cause you're the first guy who's taking me out
And it's taking his time, yes you are babe
No, you ain't tryna get in my bed on the very first night
So, what if I, I wanna kiss you tomorrow?
Tell me babe
So, what if I, come on, I wanna kiss you tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow?

Well don't be nervous, I'm so into you
Yes I am babe
Is this is something?
Am I just a fool?
What if I, tell me
I wanna kiss you tomorrow?
So what if I, I wanna kiss you tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow?
