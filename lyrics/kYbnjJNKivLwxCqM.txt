Murderer, blood is on your shoulder
Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow
Murder, your inside must be hollow
How does it feel to take the life of another?

Murderer, blood is on your shoulder
Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow
Murder, your inside must be hollow
How does it feel to take the life?

You can hide from man but not your conscience
You eat the bread of sorrow drink the wine of violence
Allow yourself to be conquered by the serpent
Why you disobey the first commandment?

Walk through the valley I feel no pestilence
God is my witness and He ma me evidence
Lift up mine eyes from whence cometh help
You coulda never escape this judgement

Murderer, blood is, blood is on your shoulder
Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow
Murder, your inside must be hollow
How does it feel to take the life?

I tell you, all men are created equal
But behind the trigger it's a different sequel
Some are murder people just to collect medals
Stop committing dirty acts for the high officials

You could wash your hands until you can't wash no more
It is like an epidemic and you won't find a cure
Upper class you could be rich, middle class wheter you're poor
Only the righteous won't feel insecure
Have you ever thought about your skill getting bored

Murderer, blood is on your shoulder
Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow
Murder, your inside must be hollow
How does it feel to take the life?

Drinking sulphur bitters won't bitter like your end
Only God can help you, no family nor friend
Don't let the curse be upon your children's children
Abdenigo, Shadreck, Meshek, Daniel in the Eden

Jonah in the whale's belly, but he was never condemned
Job with the leprosy, but still reached Heaven
He will do for you everything he has done for them.

Murderer, blood is on your shoulder
Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow
Murder, your inside must be hollow
How does it feel to take the life?

What's more? You hide from man but not your conscience
You eat the bread of sorrow drink the wine of violence
Allow yourself to be conquered by the serpent
Why you disobey the first commandment?

Walk through the valley I feel no pestilence
God is my witness and He ma me evidence
Lift up mine eyes from whence cometh help
You coulda never escape this judgement

Murderer, blood is on your shoulder
Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow
Murder, your inside must be hollow
How does it feel to take the life?

I tell you, all men are created equal
But behind the trigger it's a different sequel
Some are murder people just to collect medals
Stop committing dirty acts for the high officials

You could wash your hands until you can't wash no more
It is like an epidemic and you won't find a cure
