So save me

Here's a hammer, build a ladder
It's a long way up to Heaven
If I dig, it might take as long
But maybe in Hell, that's where I belong
Seven days and seven nights
Avoiding heat from the fires
And I have walked this path before

I am afraid I'll lose it all

Somebody, save me
Somebody, save me
I've been trying so hard, but I can't see that far
So save me

Just let it rain, I'd rather stay away
From the laughs of the common and the company of crows
Memories, they fade, but I'm far too awake
Welcome to my charade

I am afraid I'll lose it all

Somebody, save me
Somebody, save me
I've been trying so hard, but I can't see that far
So save me, so save me

So save me, save me

Just let it rain, I'd rather stay away
From the laughs of the common and the company of crows
Memories, they fade, but I'm far too awake
Welcome to my charade

I am afraid I'll lose it all

Somebody, save me
Somebody, save me
I've been trying so hard, but I can't see that far
So save me
Save me
Save me
I've been trying so hard, but I can't see that far
So save me

Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
