We go out to a party somewhere
The moment we walk in the door
And people stop and everybody stares
She don't know what they're starin' for

She don't know she's beautiful
(Never crossed her mind)
She don't know she's beautiful
(No, she's not that kind)
She don't know she's beautiful
Though time and time I've told her so

There she goes just walkin' down the street
And someone lets a whistle out
A girl like her, she just can't see
What the fuss is all about

And she don't know she's beautiful
(Never crossed her mind)
She don't know she's beautiful
(No, she's not that kind)
She don't know she's beautiful
Though time and time I've told her so

Now mornin' comes and her hair's all a mess
That's when she thinks she looks the worst
It's times like this she don't know why
I can't take my eyes off her

'Cause she don't know she's beautiful
(Never crossed her mind)
She don't know she's beautiful
(No, she's not that kind)
She don't know she's beautiful
Though time and time I've told her so

She don't know she's beautiful
(Never crossed her mind)
She don't know she's beautiful
(No, she's not that kind)
She don't know she's beautiful
Though time and time I've told her

She don't know she's beautiful
(Never crossed her mind)
She don't know she's beautiful
(No, she's not that kind)
She don't know she's beautiful
Though time and time I've told her so
She don't know she's beautiful
(Never crossed her mind)
(She don't know she's beautiful)
