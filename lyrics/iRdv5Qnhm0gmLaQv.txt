It was a long way to go
From Louisiana to Laredo
With everything that they own
Boxed up in the back of a van

She would've gone to the moon
If that's what it took to follow him
It's funny what love makes you do

Standing alone
There in the kitchen she's packing up plates again
Standing alone
She is remembering every fight with him
Thinking alone
"What am I doing here in this ghost town?"
Now that he's gone
There isn't a reason for me to stick around

And she says,
Maybe I'll move to California
With the unbroken parts of my heart
I still have left
Maybe I'll fall in love again some day
I'm not gonna hold my breath
I'm not gonna hold my breath

Which way to go
When every rod leads away from the things you wanted
Which way you go
When every memory is built like a home that's haunted
Closing your eyes
Dream of a place where things turn out the way you planned it
Everything dies
Dream of a place where the living reside again

And she says,
Maybe I'll move to California
With the unbroken parts of my heart
I still have left
Maybe I'll fall in love again some day
I'm not gonna hold my breath
I'm not gonna hold my breath

Maybe I'll move to California
With the unbroken parts of my heart
I still have left
Maybe I'll fall in love some day

Maybe I'll move to California
With the unbroken parts of my heart
I still have left
Maybe I'll fall in love again some day
I'm not gonna hold my breath
I'm not gonna hold my breath
I'm not gonna hold my breath
