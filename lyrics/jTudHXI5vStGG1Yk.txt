All the modern things
like cars and such
have always existed
They've just been waiting in a mountain
for the right moment
Listening to the irritating noises
of dinosaurs and people
dabbling outside
All the modern things
have always existed
they've just been waiting
To come out
and multiply
and take over
It's their turn now...
