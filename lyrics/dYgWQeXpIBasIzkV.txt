Anybody ever tell you that you're not home
Hollow shell of man without soul
Never ever felt your warmth cause you're always cold
Only thing that makes sense is letting go

Anybody ever tell you that you've got nerve
Treatin' my love like just another word
Tired of giving love to you that you don't deserve
So this is my way of saying it's over

'Cause I got nothin' left
I got nothin' left, I got nothin' left
I gave you my best and you treated it worthless
So I got nothin' left

Anybody ever tell you that you're gonna learn
Trust and respect are two things you must earn
When it came to lovin' me you just weren't concerned
You never gave a damn so I guess now it's my turn

'Cause I got nothin' left
I got nothin' left, I got nothin' left
I gave you my best and you treated it worthless
So I got nothin' left

So done with you
Maybe we're through
So done with you

'Cause I got nothin' left
I got nothin' left, I got nothin' left
I got nothin' left, I got nothin' left
I gave you my best and you treated it worthless
So I got nothin' left

So done with you
Maybe we're through
So done with you
