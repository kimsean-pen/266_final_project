Bleed from my pain
Revenge on treacherous snakes
They will pay
Slicing the flesh
Sculptured wounds my catharsis
I will stain
Into the heart
Needle injects gasoline
Convulsions
The one that they betrayed
Has made them this way
Plagued by the bastards
I will kill you
Killed by my rage
Scream at my face
The grisly scars went un avenged
Until know
Deep in the hole
You are gagged and scream aloud
But unheard
Choke on your vomit
You watch your hands cut off
Then your legs
The one that you betrayed
Will kill you this way
Scarred by the bastards
I will kill you
Killed by my rage
I must kill you
Into the throat
The scalpel slices
Warm blood sprays out
The gushing entices
Pull out your heart
And let you watch
Shove in your mouth
Then stab your crotch
I watch your agony
I am released from years of pain
You death averted my becoming insane
You are dead, I have killed you
