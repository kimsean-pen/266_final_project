Only you
Can make all this world seem right
Only you
Can make the darkness bright
Only you and you alone
Can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart with love for only you

O-only you
Can make all this change in me
For it's true
You are my destiny
When you hold my hand, I understand
The magic that you do
You're my dream come true
My one and only you

O-o-only you
Can make all this change in me
For it's true

You are my destiny
When you hold my hand,
I understand
The magic that you do
You're my dream come true
My one and only you
(One and only you)
