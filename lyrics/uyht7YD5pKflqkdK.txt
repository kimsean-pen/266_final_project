I know you're aching to be saved
From all the bullshit and banality
Sacredly I have watched you grow
You've conquered all the self-loathing and high hopes

I saw you giving me the signs
The perfect picture that you get my life
Now all my other gods are dead
Hallelujah to the apocalypse in my head

Knock knock
I am here for you
Who's there?
Just the eternal fool

I will be your shadow
I will follow you
Never let you go

I will be your shadow
I will follow you
Never let you go

You are a siren in my dark
You need me now like I've needed you from the start
I will protect you from yourself
I will never let the anger consume or destroy you again

Knock knock
I am here for you
Who's there?
Just the eternal fool

I will be your shadow
I will follow you
Never let you go

I will be your shadow
I will follow you
Never let you go

Knock knock
I am here for you
Who's there?
Just the eternal fool

I will be your shadow
I will follow you
Never let you go
I will follow you

I will be your shadow
I will follow you
Never let you go
