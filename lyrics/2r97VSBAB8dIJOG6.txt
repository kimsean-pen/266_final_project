Yeah, I'm gonna tell my tale come on
Come on, give a listen

Cause I was born lonely down by the riverside
Learned to spin fortune wheels, and throw dice
And I was just thirteen when I had to leave home
Knew I couldn't stick around, I had to roam
Ain't good looking, but you know I ain't shy
Ain't afraid to look it girl, hear me out
So if you need some lovin, and you need it right away
Take a little time out, and maybe I'll stay

But I got to ramble (ramblin' man)
Oh I got to gamble (gamblin' man)
Got to got to ramble (ramblin' man)
I was born a ramblin' (gamblin' man)

Yeah oh say yeah yeah yeah
Hah hah bring it on, come down
Yeah alright, here we go now now now
I'm out of money, cause you know I need some
Ain't around to lovin, and I must run
Gotta keep moving, never gonna slow down
You can have your funky world, see you 'round

Cause I got to ramble (ramblin' man)
Oh I got to gamble (gamblin' man)
Got to got to ramble (ramblin' man)
You know I'm a ramblin' (gamblin' man)

Oh oh I'm just a ramble
Yeah I'm just a gamble
Come on and sing along
Cause I'm just a ramble (ramblin' man)
You know I'm a gamble (gamblin' man)
I'm a ramble (ramblin' man)
Yeah I'm a ramble (gamblin' man)
Hah hah hah yea hah a ramble (ramblin' man)
