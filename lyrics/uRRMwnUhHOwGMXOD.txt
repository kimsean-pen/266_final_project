Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, ooh (never can say goodbye girl)
Never can say goodbye (never can say goodbye girl)

Even though the pain and heartache
Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why (Tell me why)
Is it so (Is it so)

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, ooh (never can say goodbye girl)
Never can say goodbye (never can say goodbye girl)

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core
It says, turn around, you fool
You know you love him more and more

Tell me why (Tell me why)
Is it so (Is it so)
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye girl (never can say goodbye girl)
Ooh ooh baby (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no

Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl (never can say goodbye girl)
Ooh ooh ooh (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh

Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, ooh (say goodbye girl)
Never can say goodbye (say goodbye girl)

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hangup
Can't do with you or without

Tell me why (Tell me why)
Is it so (Is it so)
Don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye girl (never can say goodbye girl)
Ooh ooh baby (hey baby)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no

Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl (never can say goodbye girl)
Ooh oh (hey baby)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh

I never can say goodbye girl (never can say goodbye girl)
Ooh ooh baby (hey baby)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no

Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl (never can say goodbye girl)
Ooh oh (hey baby)
