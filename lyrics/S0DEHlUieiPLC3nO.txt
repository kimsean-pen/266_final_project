Make enemies of truth and reason
In that a rage is born
Start out a promise and a venture
Where direction was never the goal

How does it feel
To run out of nothing
Where do you go
When you run out?

Never you mind
The grand perspective
Other forces kept at bay
As you narrow the field of vision
To retain a sense of control
Your focus will remain unfixed
In the haze of a world unhinged

Create a sense of purpose
Around which you base your faith
The doubt that haunts your skin
An itch that will linger on
Forever

How does it feel
To run out of nothing
Where do you go
When you run out?

You wave off
Critique as an offender
Never question
Where your motives lie
As a part of the greatest fable
The beast all had forgotten
Instincts in a dead end rampage
Destruction as a saving grace

You run out of nothing

How does it feel
To run out of nothing
Where do you go
When you run out?

How does it feel
To run out of nothing
Where do you go?
Where do you go?
