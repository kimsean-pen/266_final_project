Back in the day, yo as we learned
A man was not considered to be
Considered to be fully grown
Has he not gone beyond the hills
Has he not crossed the seven seas
Yeah, seven seas at least

Now all them jokers kept around
Just like the scarecrows in hometown
Yeah, scarecrows in hometown
From screen to screen they're travelling

But I'm a wonderlust king
I stay on the run
Let me out
Let me be gone
In the world beat-up road sign
I saw new history of time
New history of -
Taradarada taradarada taradarara oh
Taradarada taradarada taradarara oh
Taradarada oh

Through Siberian woods
Breaking up their neck
Yeah, breaking up their neck
Chinese moving in, building discoteques
Yeah, building discoteques

Tran-Siberian sex toys and whatnot
Yeah, why not?
Well, at least it's something different
From what they got in every other airport

Je ne Jevrei, no koje-chto pohozhe
Sovrat ne dast ni Yura ni Seryozha!
Simply because I'm not a total gadjo
Da ja shut, ja cirkach, nu tak chto-zhe?

I travelled the world looking for understanding
Of the times that we live in
Hunting and gathering firsthand information
Challenging definitions of sin

I travelled the world looking for lovers
Of the ultimate beauty
But never settling in...

I am a wonderlust king
I stay on the run
Let me out
Let me gone
In the world's beat-up road sign
I saw new history of time
New history of-

And presidents
And billionaires
And generals
They'll never know
They'll never know
What I have owned
What I have owned...

I am a wonderlust king.
