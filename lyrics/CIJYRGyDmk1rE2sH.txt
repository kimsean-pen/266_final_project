Victims all lay bound and tied
Horrifying screams and cried
Headmaster shines his blade
On the block your head is laid

Cut in half, you scream and writhe
Guts pour out from inside
Gouge your eyes out of your head
Torture you until your dead

Break your bones, tear your flesh
Mutilate your fucking face

Body parts lay around in my human slaughter house
Lick the blood off my knife - smile and take another life

Burst your chest and eat your heart
Defiling bodies is my art
Limbless torsos piled up
One of them I slowly fuck

Tear your limbs off one by one
Killing to me is such fun
My hacksaw yearns for you
Now there's nothing you can do
