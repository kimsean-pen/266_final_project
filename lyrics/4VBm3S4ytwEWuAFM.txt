Ohh, Too much of anything can make you sick,
Even the good can be a curse. (curse),
Makes it hard to know which road to go down,
Knowing too much can get you hurt

Is it better is it worse,
Are we sittin in reverse,
Its just like were going backwards,
I know where i want this to go,
Drivin fast but lets go slow,
What i dont wanna do is crash. no

Just know that your not in this thing alone,
Theres always a place in me that you can call home,
Whenever you feel like were growing apart,
Lets just go back back back back back to the start, Ohh

Anything thats worth havin,
Sure enough worth fighting for,
Quittin's out of the question,
When it gets tough gotta fight some more, (Ohh)
We gotta fight fight fight fight fight for this love,
We gotta fight fight fight fight fight for this love,
We gotta fight fight fight fight fight for this love,
If its worth having, it's worth fightin for, Ohh

Now everyday ain't gon be no picnic,
Love aint no walk in the park,
All u can do is make the best of it now,
Cant be afraid of the dark

Just know that your not in this thing alone,
Theres always a place in me that you can call home,
Whenever you feel like were growing apart,
Let's just go back back back back back to the start, Ohh

Anything thats worth havin,
Sure enough worth fighting for,
Quittin's out of the question,
When it gets tough gotta fight some more,
We gotta fight fight fight fight fight for this love,
We gotta fight fight fight fight fight for this love,
We gotta fight fight fight fight fight for this love,
If its woth having, it's worth fightin for, Ohhh

I dont know where were headin,
Im willin and ready to go,
We've been drivin so fast,
We just need to slow down,
And just roll, ohh

Anything thats worth havin,
Sure enough worth fighting for,
Quittin's out of the question,
When it gets tough gotta fight some more,
We gotta fight fight fight fight fight for this love,
We gotta fight fight fight fight fight for this love,
