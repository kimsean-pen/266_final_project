i can feel the walls closing in
and i don't want to talk anymore
wish i could quietly slip away
and leave you here with no void
the only reason i stay is to care for you
everything else in me has atrophied
and i am cold and painless now
i want to live but i feel nothing

when can i die, when can i go
when will i be free, when will i know
when can i run – my legs are bound
when can i go, when can i go

was born a blackened seed in the wild
and i never was a child
i was pulled right out of the sea
and the salt – it never left my body
someone opened me up while i was sleeping
and filled my body right up with sand
i carry a heaviness like a mountain
it forces me to remain
alive and ugly, alive and ugly
alive and ugly, alive and ugly

when can i die, when can i go
when will i be free, when will i know
when can i run, my legs are bound
can i leave here, knowing you'll be strong without me

they'll clap when you die
they'll love you when you're dead
and they'll understand
and you'll be forgiven then
