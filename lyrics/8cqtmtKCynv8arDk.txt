Don't lie to me
Don't make it up
Don't snake it up
Don't snake it up
My friend

Stay with me
Lay with me
Be true to me
Be true to me my love

Now I'm young
I got nothing to lose
I'm gonna follow
I'm following my muse

You're the older one
You're older by now
You're one got some
You're one got some to prove

Well it's only me
It's only me now
I cannot change you
But time will
My heart it will
Not stand still

I cannot hold
A half a life
I cannot be
At half a wife
