One small thread keeps you hostage
To the better side of death
One small chain a ghost in limbo
It's all for the best

We see your shine
More than the dull you fear
You're a rare kind
If you could see from the outside

To be a witness
To those deep, deep wounds
To resist it
To keep that knife from you

To be a witness
To those deep, deep wounds
To resist it
To keep that knife from you

Second chance to pull you
From the wreckage of your mind
I'll do anything I can
To rip you from the edge in time

We see your shine
More than the dull you fear
You're a rare kind
If you could see from the outside

To be a witness
To those deep, deep wounds
To resist it
To keep that knife from you

To be a witness
To those deep, deep wounds
To resist it
To keep that knife from you
