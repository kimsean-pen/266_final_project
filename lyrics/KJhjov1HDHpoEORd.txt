Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
I've got this thing that I consider my only art
Of fucking people over

My boss just quit the job
Says he's goin' out to find blind spots
And he'll do it

The 3rd planet is sure that they're being watched
By an eye in the sky that can't be stopped
When you get to the promised land
You're gonna shake that eye's hand

Your heart felt good
It was dripping pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath

Well, outside, naked, shivering, looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflected off the moon
Baby come angels fly around you
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two

And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end

Well a third had just been made
And we were swimming in the water
Didn't know then
Was it a son, was it a daughter?

When it occurred to me
That the animals are swimming
Around in the water
In the oceans in our bodies

And another had been found
Another ocean on the planet
Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic
And how

The universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were

The universe is shaped exactly like the earth

Your heart felt good
It was dripping pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath

Well, outside naked, shivering, looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflected off the moon
Baby come angels fly around you
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two

And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end

Well a third had just been made
And we were swimming in the water
Didn't know then
Was it a son, was it a daughter

When it occurred to me

Around in the water
In the oceans in our bodies
And another had been found
Another ocean on the planet
Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic
And how

Well the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth

Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
