I've dreamt of you my whole life
And now I've met you
I never thought I could feel the way I do
They say it only happens in fairy tales
But I can tell you the tale of my love is true

You asked me what I'm made of
I'm made to feel your love
You're all I ever think of
I'm dying for your love

I will follow you
Down the river
The wind can carry both of us back home
You don't have to die alone

I knew the very moment that I saw you
That I had fallen into the deepest blue
I've only ever seen this in the movies
But all the feelings on my skin are true

You asked me what I'm made of
I'm made to feel your love
You're all I ever think of
I'm dying for your love

I will follow you
Down the river
The wind can carry both of us back home
I will follow you
Down the river
The water carries both our hearts of stone
You don't have to die alone

I will follow you
Down the river
The wind can carry both of us back home
You don't have to die alone
