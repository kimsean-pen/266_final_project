Come down all around
It comes down in the hardest places
Came down all around me
New days come around
At sundown we can change our faces
Bad air all around me

You broke into my heart

Take me, take me, make me over
Feel me, peel me, make me better

We can burn away the things we do
I would love to burn with you
