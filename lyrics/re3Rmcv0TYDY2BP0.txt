It was summer in the city and my heart stood still
I looked at the past inside my rearview mirror
There was nobody behind me and nothing up ahead
The sky was blue and all I knew
Was I would never feel the same again
I knew I'd never feel the same again

There was imagery in motion, there was gossip in the class
There was holding hands and making plans, I knew it wouldn't last
And of all the time we wasted and all the time it took
And if I had more time then I wish you would
I really really really wish you would

But that's the part we never tried to stop
We never tried

Ooooh

No regret, don't you forget
This magnificent time
Seize the day, don't throw away
This magnificent time

I was somewhere in the city and my heart went boom
I packed all my troubles in a different room
And I thought of all the could have beens, the roads we never took
And how the story ends and I understood
I really really really understood

But that's the part we never tried to stop
We never tried

Ooooh

No regret, don't you forget
This magnificent time
Seize the day, don't throw away
This magnificent time
No regret, don't you forget
This magnificent time
Seize the day, don't throw away
This magnificent time
Magnificent time
Magnificent time
