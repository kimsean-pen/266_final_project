Can't escape from the night
Didn't learn to dance
The rhythm of the day
Sucha sucha shame

So neat is the walk
Even rough the way
Don't you know why I came here today

You don't know the things they'd do to you
You don't know the things they will do
And you don't know the things I'd do for you
But now they turn to you
Now you moved

You walk on your way to heaven
You're on your way to heaven
You're on your way to heaven
You're in heaven
And you walk

So neat

So neat is the walk
Even rough the way
Don't you know why I came here today

You can't escape from the night
You didn't learn to dance
The rhythm of the day
You sucha sucha shame

And you don't know the things they'd do to you
You don't know the things they will do
You don't know the things I'd do for you
But now they turn to you
Now you moved

You walk on your way to heaven
