I know when to go
I know when to go
Take my time down the hall
With my eyes up on the wall
I hear my shoes and I hear my sigh
I watch myself walk out from the light

Clovers in my eyes
The way the light falls
On the bus on the way home
Clovers in my eyes
Trying to stay awake
Trying to stay away

Lying down on the grass
Clover bed under my back
Close my eyes
In the middle of the day
Close my eyes
And it feels just the same

Clovers in my eyes
The way the light falls
On the bus on the way home
Clovers in my eyes
Trying to stay awake
Trying to stay away

Clovers in my eyes
The way the light falls
On the bus on the way home
Clovers in my eyes
Trying to stay awake
Trying to stay away

Clovers in my eyes
