Are you awake
You're gonna have to hear the words I say
Don't you try turn away
I'm everything you ever dreamed I'd be
I'll make you wish that you never talked
Back to me

I can't wait to watch your ego bleed
Your pain will set me free

I'd bite I'd scratch I'd hold you down
Just to turn you on
I'd leave you waiting tied and bound
Just to turn you on
Close your eyes
And come with me tonight
I'd burn this whole room to the ground
Just to turn, just to turn you on

I'll make you beg
I'm gonna teach you things you won't forget
Don't you try turn away
I'm everything you ever dreamed I'd be
I'll make you wish that you never talked
Back to me

I can't wait to watch your ego bleed
Your pain will set me free

I'd bite I'd scratch I'd hold you down
Just to turn you on
I'd leave you waiting tied and bound
Just to turn you on
Close your eyes
And come with me tonight
I'd burn this whole room to the ground
Just to turn, just to turn you on

I can't wait to watch your ego bleed
And all the pain you feel will set you free
If you behave this night will never end
Turn off the lights and start again

I'd bite I'd scratch I'd hold you down
Just to turn you on
I'd leave you waiting tied and bound
Just to turn you on
Close your eyes
And come with me tonight
I'd burn this whole room to the ground
Just to turn, just to turn you on
