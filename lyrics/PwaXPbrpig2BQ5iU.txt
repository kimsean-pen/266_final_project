Do I
Do I love you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
Do I do I need you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
You saved me with warmth and understanding
You're everything that I could ever want
And after so long we're standing here together
And forever we'll live on
In time most other loves just wither and fade, I tell ya
Ours just gets stronger each and every day
Do I
Do I love you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
Do I do I need you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
Hey-come over here for a second...
I got something I wanna say...
Even though I may not think to tell you every day...
Ooh - I'm so happy you're still mine!
Oh, you came along with a love so sweet, took me by surprise
Knocked me off my feet
You still send shivers up and down my spine
Oh I gotta be the luckiest man alive
