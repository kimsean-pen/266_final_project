Sepia
The waning moon in
A turbid night sky
The strident voice with
Unending feedback

There were flimsy excuses
There were hundreds of stories
There were loose ends, untieable
There were obvious head fakes

There were
Plenty of warnings
Plenty of warnings
You've seen it coming
You've seen it coming
I'm really sorry
I'm really sorry
You're not conforming
To the escape plan

The glistening sun in
The hungry morning
Suburban idyll
All drenched in sepia

Homogeneity
The proper choices
Fading reminders
Your dreams mean nothing

There were landfills of data
There were gigabytes, terabytes
There were attacks from all sides
There were obstructed exits

And there is
Your stagnant heartbeat...
