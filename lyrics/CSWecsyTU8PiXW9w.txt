Sight, what a terrible sight
Seeing my own demise
Worms crawl, maggots creeping
God, tell me that I am sleeping

I'm holding on in vain
You have killed again
Nursery rhymes off tune
Nothing can make it right
Letting go without a fight
He will kill again

She's supposed to light my way
Now this light blinds my eye
Senses down all is bleak
Why did you leave me dry?

Die! How could you kill like this?
Burning down all that's right
Why her smile? Why her life?
Speak to me, you have no right

Why did this have to be?
No colour meets my eye
And no tears left to dry
Life is but a terrible lie
