A Street That Rhymes at 6 a.m.

Fly a red balloon on someone else's time
They will try to pull you down and change your mind
Break lose and find a new skyline

Syncopate your life and move against the grain
Don't you let them tell you that we're all the same
Point forward to* is not your name

It's 6 a.m. I'm looking for a street that rhymes
All I want is a new skyline

Everyone is digging in a parallel line
People always live and die in 4/4 time
All I want is to take my time

It's 6 a.m. I'm looking for a street that rhymes
All I want is a new skyline

Contemplate the rows that put you under ground
Find a place and time, don't go to lost and found
Everybody's always pushing around

It's 6 a.m. I'm looking for a street that rhymes
