One love, one love
Enrique Iglesias
Pitbull
Ya'll know what time it is
We gonna set it off tonight, just go
Set the club on fire, just go
Enrique! Holla at them like

Girl, please excuse me if I'm coming to you strong
But tonight is the night we can really let go
My girlfriend's out of town and I'm all alone
Your boyfriend's on vacation and he doesn't have to know

No one can do the things I'm gonna wanna do to you
Shout aloud, screamin loud. Let me hear you go!

Baby I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby I like it
I like it

Party, Karamu, fiesta, forever

Girl, please excuse me if I'm misbehaving, oh
I'm trying to keep my hands off but you're begging me for more
Round round round, baby low low low
Let the time time pass 'cause we're never getting old

No one can do it better, turn around I'll give you more
Shout aloud, screamin loud. Let me hear you go!

Baby I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby I like it
I like it

Go DJ, that's my DJ
I'm a Miami boy, you know how we play
I ain't playin withya but I wanna play withya
Get me, got me? Good, now watch me
It's a different species, get me in DC
Let's party on the White House lawn
Tiger Woods times Jesse James
Equals Pitbull all night long
Pick up Barack and Michelle and let 'em that it's on
Pa' fuera! Pa' la calle!
Dale mamita tirame ese baile!
Dale mamita tirame ese baile!
I see you watchin me, you see me watchin' you
I love the way you move
I like them things you do like

Don't stop baby, don't stop baby
Just keep on shaking along
I won't stop baby, won't stop baby
Until you get enough

Party, Karamu, fiesta, forever

Baby I like it!
The way you move on the floor
Baby I like it!
Come on and give me some more!
Oh yes I like it!
Screaming like never before
Baby I like it!
I like it!

Baby I like it!
The way you move on the floor
Baby I like it!
Come on and give me some more!
Oh yes I like it!
Screaming like never before
Baby I like it!
