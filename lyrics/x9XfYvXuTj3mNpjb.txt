I can beat the night, I'm not afraid of thunder
I am full of light, I am full of wonder
Wo-oh, Wo-oh, I ain't falling under
Wo-oh, Wo-oh, I am full of wonder
Though our feet might ache
The world's upon our shoulders
No way we goin' break
Cause we are full of wonder
Wo-oh, Wo-oh, I ain't falling under
Wo-oh, Wo-oh, I am full of wonder
This light is contagious, go, go tell your neighbours
Just reach out and pass it on
This light is contagious, go, go tell your neighbours
Just reach out and pass it on ooh yeah
This light is contagious, go, go tell your neighbours
Just reach out and pass it on ooh yeah
This light is contagious, go, go tell your neighbours
Just reach out and pass it on yeah
Wo-oh, Wo-oh, I ain't falling under
Wo-oh, Wo-oh, I am full of wonder
When everything feels wrong, and darkness falls upon you
Just try sing along, this is a message from Cabana
If your heart turns blue, I want you to remember
This song is for you, and you are full of wonder
Wo-oh, Wo-oh, we ain't falling under
Wo-oh, Wo-oh, we are full of wonder
Wo-oh, Wo-oh, we ain't falling under
Wo-oh, Wo-oh, we are full of wonder
