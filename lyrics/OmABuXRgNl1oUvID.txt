Did you ever loan me that song? Did you ever know me at all?
You listen to the world going wrong looking through a hole in the wall
Shoving our loving away, leaving our light on the side
Never once looking to say, "We got the ride of our lives"

Did we ever find a way to steer
Through the cold light of day?
'Cause we're just passing through
And it ain't what you done but it is what you do

Soon as time comes and goes, soon on the verge of who knows
A sound we're dancing around, turn up the music and drown

Did we ever find a way to steer
Through the cold light of day?
'Cause we're just passing through
And it ain't what you done but it is what you do
Let's go, let's go

Some people change, move out of range
All in a day, so long, so long

So let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

Did you ever loan me that song? Did you ever know me at all?
