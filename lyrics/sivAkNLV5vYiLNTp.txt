It's in the way they look at you
The clothes you wear the books you read
Looking for another view
Only trying to succeed
Could it be that they suspect you game is up they're on to you

Paranoises on the phone paranormal dialling tone
Why can't they leave me alone
Why can't they leave me alone

Do you really think that I'm afraid of being heard
Just because I'm not in love with the western world
Keep your past to yourself don't mix with the rest
All your work's in vain when in the end you fail the test
Just because you're not the same you're the one to take the blame

Tightened up security
Now who's frightened
No not me
Tightened up security
Now who's frightened
No not me

We're too vital to your cause
Dragged into your bloody wars
Secrets in my head to stay
Let me live in my own way

Prime target's just been missed
Prime target's just been missed
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
A security risk
A security risk

I'm tired of being
I'm tired of being
A security risk
A security risk

We're too vital to your cause
Dragged into your bloody wars
Secrets in my head to stay
Let me live in my own way

Prime target's just been missed
Prime target's just been missed
I don't wanna be
A security risk
