I'm naked
I'm numb
I'm stupid
I'm staying
And if Cupid's got a gun
Then he's shootin'

Lights black
Heads bang
You're my drug
We live it
You're drunk
You need it
Real love
I'll give it

So we're bound to linger on
We drink the fatal drop
Then love until we bleed
Then fall apart in parts

You wasted your times
On my heart
You've burned
And if bridges gotta fall
Then you'll fall too

Doors slam
Lights black
You're gone
Come back
Stay gone
Stay clean
I need you
To need me

So we're bound to linger on
We drink the fatal drop
Then love until we bleed
Then fall apart in parts

Now we're bound to linger on
We drink the fatal drop
Then love until we bleed
Then fall apart in parts
