Exchanging of adornment ordered by the throne.
Causality of erroneous superstition.
Revelations unfolding massacres.
Betrayal in the name of the gods.
Observing an archaic conflict uncoil by the means of conviction through the harvester.
Perception altered by aberration, consequent to the influence.
The hive mind swarm penetrating minds.
Absolute septicity among vermin.
Infiltration of the the charity.
Once flourishing in life, offering shelter to those abroad.
The galaxy's exotic mass grave.
Child of my enemy, why have you come?
I offer no forgiveness.
A father's sins passed to his son.
Time has taught me patience.
But basking in new freedom, I will know all that I possess.
In the grand scheme of things, good and evil, atrocious and nourishing.
Revelations unfolding massacres in the name of their gods.
The obelisk of time.
A grave for the mind.
Memories of death fuels all mankind.
A growth beyond control.
A fire in which it shall burn alone.
Come forth beyond space and time to consume and conquer.
A demented, lost state of mind.
Necrotized, excruciating genocide.
The hive mind swarm penetrating minds.
Once flourishing in life of those abroad.
The exotic mass grave.
In the grand scheme of things, good and evil, atrocious and nourishing.
Revelations unfolding massacres in the name of their gods.
To be crushed in their mutiny, consumed in murderous revelry.
A desire un-relished.
Betrayal in the name of their gods.
