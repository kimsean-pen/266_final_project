When you flew out of the nest you made a mistake

Flew all the way back
When you got back to your den, one minute too late was already wrecked
I... I...
It's a fraction of a whole but it's hard to control

I... I... get this straight
You can't can't count on a second chance
The second chance will never be found

You can't can't count on a second try
The second try will never come 'round
(oooooh, ooooh)
You stick to what you knew before, don't know what you like

Just played up your mind
The picture still hangs on the wall, from back in the day
When you had it all
I... I...
It's a fraction of a whole but it's hard to control
I... I... get this straight

You can't can't count on a second chance
The second chance will never be found
You can't can't count on a second try

The second try will never come 'round
You can't count count on a second chance
The second chance will never be found
You can't can't count on a second try

The second try is such a come-down

I... I...
It's a fraction of a whole but it's hard to control

I... I... Get this straight
You can't can't count on a second chance
The second chance will never be found
You can't can't count on a second try
The second try will never come 'round
You can't can't count on a second chance
The second chance will never be found
You can't can't count on a second try
The second try is such a come-down
