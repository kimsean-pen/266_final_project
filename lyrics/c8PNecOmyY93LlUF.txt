Sipping our love
All you need to know
Baby girl, I'm drunk
Tell me how you mixing
What you pouring in my cup
Tell me if you came to party
Tell me or you got somebody

Sipping our love
All you need to know
Baby girl I'm drunk
Tell me how you mixing
What you pouring in my cup?
Tell me if you came to party
Tell me or you got somebody

The city don't forgive, no
The city don't forget nobody
The city don't forgive, no
The city don't forget nobody

Only one minute to midnight
60 ticks 'til the clock strikes 12
Every time you get to do right
Say what you wanna do, what you wanna do

Only one minute to midnight
60 ticks 'til the clock strikes 12
Every time you get to do right
Say what you wanna do, what you wanna do

Sipping our love
All you need to know
Baby girl, I'm drunk
Tell me how you mixing
What you pouring in my cup
Tell me if you came to party
Tell me or you got somebody

Only one minute to midnight
60 ticks 'til the clock strikes 12
Every time you get to do right
Say what you wanna do, what you wanna do

The city don't forgive, no
The city don't forget nobody
The city don't forgive, no
The city don't forget, no
