My medicine puts you to sleep
I carried you in, you chewed up my sleeve
Oh well, oh well
We're at it again, been laid up for days
Cursing the sun, yeah, we're praying for rain
Oh well, oh well

Don't wanna fall asleep
Go on and call the police
Turn us in, we're the freaks
Yeah, we're Adam and Eve
In the garden, we'll start over
Take your medicine

Your medicine keeps me awake
We tore up the house, we got carried away
Oh well, oh well
We're at it again, we've been up for days
You said you're in love but you ain't changing your name
Oh well, oh well

Don't wanna fall asleep
Go on and call the police
Turn us in, we're the freaks
Yeah, we're Adam and Eve
In the garden, we'll start over
Take your medicine

Year-old mushrooms you found in the freezer
Stormed outside, I became a believer
And telekinesis in your rambling thesis
The leaves on the trees, they were whispering

Don't wanna fall asleep
Go on and call the police
Turn us in, we're the freaks
Yeah, we're Adam and Eve
In the garden, we'll start over
We'll get it right
