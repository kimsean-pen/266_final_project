A tale forgotten long ago
Brought to life again
Ancient wisdom ancient lies
Horrid lullabies for the Earth

Time - will turn my prophecies into reality
And it will lead the world astray
Death - found the remedy for its enemy
It's too late the seize the day
Time - and my malicious spells live in harmony
They await the hour set
Rapture - of all that is alive
The reaper will arrive to invert the hour glass

Oh, uncreation
The evolution in reverse
Oh, uncreation
The death of universe

His reflections on the end
Still unknown to man
Dark predictions, dark cliches
In this recital of doom

Time - will turn my prophecies into reality
And they await the hour set
Death - found the remedy for its enemy
It will invert the hour glass
Time - and my malicious spells live in harmony
It will lead the world astray
Rapture - of all that is alive
The reaper will arrive, it's too late the seize the day

Oh, uncreation
The evolution in reverse
Oh, uncreation
The death of universe

The world is aging backwards
The young remains the young
We all know tomorrow
Will be yesterday reborn
The time and space deserted
Will hold no life for man
We face these final hours
To be buried in the past

Something is wrong with the sky tonight
The clouds are darker than ever before
There is unrest in the stars alight
As if they warned me for the distant roar

A tale forgotten long ago
Brought to life again
Ancient wisdom ancient lies
Horrid lullabies for the Earth

Time - will turn my prophecies into reality
And it will lead the world astray
Death - found the remedy for its enemy
It's too late the seize the day
Time - and my malicious spells live in harmony
They await the hour set

The reaper will arrive to invert the hour glass

Oh, uncreation
The evolution in reverse
Oh, uncreation
The death of universe

Oh, uncreation
The evolution in reverse
Oh, uncreation
The death of universe

A tale forgotten long ago
Brought to life again
Ancient wisdom ancient lies
Lullabies for the Earth

The sun is descending
Nevermore to shine
Light is lost forever
We are the last in line

We are the last in line!
