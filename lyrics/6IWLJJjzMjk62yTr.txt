No time for coffee or conversation
Get the feeling I stay too long
Suspicious eyes at the subway station
Bye bye, I'm already gone
Bye bye, I'm already gone

I went down to Tallahassee
Pink flamingos on the lawn
Girls were rough and the boys were nasty
Bye bye, I'm already gone
Bye bye, I'm already gone

So pay the rent, don't leave no evidence
I'm history; I can't get free

Already gone
Already gone
Already gone
Already gone

Ended up in Okeechobee
Got in shape and grew my hair long
Made some friends singing karaoke
Bye bye, I'm already gone
Bye bye, I'm already gone

So pay the rent, don't leave no evidence
I'm history; I can't get free

Already gone
Already gone
Already gone
Already gone

No time for coffee or conversation
Roll down the window and let me taste it
I'm already, I-I'm already, I-I'm already
I'm already gone

Already gone
Already gone
(Gone, gone, g-gone, gone)
Already gone
Already gone
Already gone
Already gone
Already gone
(Gone, gone, g-gone, gone)
Already gone
