What's the point in conflict
What are you tryin to proof
Too much confrontation
Always against the good
Just like we are sutured in hatred
Unless we change our ways
Avoid a confrontation
To see them brighter days
Too much pointless indifference
Just leave it unsaid
Intelligencies is intuitive
Said a shock into the head
My love is my
Source of imagination
I do and love for the day
Imagine, Imagine Imagine, Imagine, ah
Imagine, Imagine, yeah
Imagine, Imagine, ah
Ask yourself,
What is your purpose
To hide behind reality, yeah
Or rise to the surface
Rise above all of the
Frogen and powers
To take back to what is
Rightfully ours
Control yourself,
Let the world around you
Take what it needs to
Let the love surround you
My love is my
Source of imaginatioin
I do a lot for it, yeah
Imagine, Imagine Imagine, Imagine, yeah
Imagine Imagine, ah
Imagine, Imagine, yeah
Imagine Imagine, ah
Imagine, Imagine, yeah
Imagine Imagine, ah
Imagine, Imagine, yeah
