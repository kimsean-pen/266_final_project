In my bones
I can feel it in my bones
In a way that I never felt before
I just can't stop from wondering where you are
How's it for you baby?

Don't know why
Don't know where to begin
Don't know what is or isn't happening
Don't know how
My head's in such a spin
Is yours in one too baby?

And it goes on
It goes on and on
While you're here
And long after you're gone
Can't pretend no more
I just can't pretend I'm not in love with you
That's not true
True

Drift away
And only dream of you
And I have to say
I wake up in the mood
It had your name
As a knuckle tattoo
But I think I might do shawty

In my bones
I can feel it in my bones
In a way that I never felt before
I just can't stop from wondering where you are
How's it for you baby?

And it goes on
It goes on and on
While you're here
And long after you're gone
Can't pretend no more
I just can't pretend I'm not in love with you
That's not true
True
True
