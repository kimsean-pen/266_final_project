Let me take you to the movies. can i take you to the show
let me be yours ever truly. can i make your garden grow
From the houses of the holy, we can watch the white doves go
from the door comes satan's daughter, and it only goes to show. you know.
There's an angel on my shoulder, in my hand a sword of gold
let me wander in your garden. and the seeds of love i'll sow. you know.
So the world is spinning faster. are you dizzy when you're stoned
let the music be your master. will you heed the master's call
oh... satan and man.
Said there ain't no use in crying. cause it will only, only drive you mad
does it hurt to hear them lying? was this the only world you had? oh-oh
So let me take you, take you to the movie. can i take you, baby, to the show.
why don't you let me be yours ever truly. can i make your garden grow
you know.
