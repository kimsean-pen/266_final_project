I remember when i met you
Well we fell in love, we fell in love
In the purple fields and sky blue
Ah Ah Ah

Well the turtle doves were singing
Well we fell in love, we fell in love
You and me at the beginning
Ah Ah Ah

Our beautiful lavender fields
Where we could be together
'Cause i dream about lavender fields
Well tell me, you remember.

'Cause the wind is getting colder
Leaves are fall in off, fall in off
And our love is getting older
So dream about lavender fields
But nothing is really fading
Birds are taking off, taking off
But you'll always find me waiting
By beautiful lavender fields

I remember when you kissed me
I fell in love, i fell in love
I'm right here but don't you miss me
Ahhhhh Ah Ah

Our beautiful lavender fields
Where we could be together
'Cause i dream about lavender fields
Well tell me, you remember.

'Cause the wind is getting colder
Leaves are fall in off, fall in off
And our love is getting older
So dream about lavender fields
But nothing is really fading
Birds are taking off, taking off
But your love was find me waiting
By beautiful lavender fields

So keep dreaming, dreaming of us babe
