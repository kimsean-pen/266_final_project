Curse your job and all that you wanted
(Condemned and bored It's not what you wanted)
Curse this life and all that you have here
(The worst is yours, but this is different)
Because we don't have a single thing to say
Your words were so brutal because I felt the sting of hell

Claim your verse (The holy word)
How many have you counted?
(Righteous and ready in hand)
Its words you fear as if they can't be found in
(They are your own)
Found inside what you wanted to say

The lines blurred and we knew it
But what if they hear what if they tell?

You held the word so high so everyone one could see me
Freedom felt like a lie
It was easy to condemn me of this
You can't be of this
You're filled with the spirit that was here
And preceded everyone and everything I know
(The curse was thrust on me, the child so haunted
Never free, could never trust it
And I wanted to tell you everything I would want be but that
Would have cost more than anything)

Can't you tell me what does S mean to you?
What does fear do for you?
I lived that way for so long that I almost forgot
That a friend is all we need
F is not what you're saying
It's a game that you're playing
Avoid the questions as you highlight the words in red, all
Instead of saying what you mean

They say the words
They sing the words
Become the words
Control the words
They say the words
They sing the words
Become the words
Control the words
They say the words
They sing the words
Become the words
Control the words
They say the words
They sing the words
Become the words
Control the words
