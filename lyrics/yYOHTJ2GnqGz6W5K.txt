I've got emotion drippin' out my pores
And I thought I would let ya know
You are the nightlight rippin' through my wicked world
How you make it sparkle and glow

Before I lose control there's just one thing you should know
THIS IS FOR REAL
This time I mean it
I'm coming clean, please, don't let go
I said from the start that you could take it or leave it
I'd prefer that you keep it
Don't let go, don't let go, don't let go

I had some nightmares clawing at my skin and bones
I nearly did explode
You smoked the demons, gave me back my feelings
Now I am good to go!

Before my face hits the floor
There's just one thing you should know!
THIS IS FOR REAL
This time I mean it
I'm coming clean, please, don't let go
I said from the start that you could take it or leave it
I'd prefer that you keep it
Don't let go

This is the best thing I've ever had for real
This is the best thing I've ever had for real

For a physical challenge, I'm notoriously bored
Intravenous delivery: electrolytes and more
Every time it's the same routine:
Out with the bad, in with the clean

Before I lose all motor skills, there's one thing you should know
THIS IS FOR REAL
This time I mean it
I'm coming clean please don't let go
I said from the start that you could take it or leave it
I prefer that you keep it
Don't let go
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real!
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real!
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real!
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real!
