Oh yeah you look at me
When my baby
Is taking my hand
And we're walking and talking
And my parents
They don't wanna see me
My friends say I'm uncool
But I let love rule

Oh yeah
It's just because I'm crazy in love
Crazy in love
Oh yeah
It's just because I'm crazy in love
Crazy in love

Oh no
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine
Oh no
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine

Oh yeah we run away
From private eyes
To privacy
My boy and me
Oh yeah you look at me
When my baby
Is taking my hand and we're walking and talking

Oh yeah
It's just because I'm crazy in love
Crazy in love

Oh no
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine
Oh no
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine

This boy really drives you mad
And you know that ain't bad, oh yeah
You'll love him till you die

This boy really drives you mad
And you know that ain't bad, oh yeah

Oh yeah
It's just because I'm crazy in love
Crazy in love
