You sure look real pretty in your glass house
You probably think you're too good to take the trash out
Well, are you dumb or are you blind
'Cause it's a real fine line
Between tellin' a joke and turnin' the knob
Don't wreck my reputation
Let me wreck my own
Step off, step off
Yeah, you're getting to close to me with all your negativity
Just, get lost
Just trying to make a little difference here so why ya gotta interfere
Just keep climbin' that mountain of dirty tricks
And when you finally get
To the top
Step off, yeah
You screwed everybody over in this town
Ain't nothing between you and the cold hard ground
Keep runnin' your mouth and stretchin' the truth
And you just might find a hole in your parachute
'Cause what ever gets you high
Will always bring you down
So step off, step off
Yeah, you're getting to close to me with all your negativity
Just, get lost
Just trying to make a little difference here so why ya gotta interfere
Just keep climbin' that mountain of dirty tricks
And when you finally get
To the top
Hmm, step off
Sticks and stones may build a throne
But you'll be up there all, alone
So step off
Yeah, yeah, step off
Ya keep climbin' that mountain of dirty tricks
Yeah, when you finally get
To the top
Step off, hmmmm, just step off
Step off
