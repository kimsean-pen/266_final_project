Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Say the word
I want to hear
Come up behind me and hold on
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
And close in around me
Say you'll do anything for me
Say you'll do what you don't understand
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Come all around me and hold on
I'll be your body when your body is broken
