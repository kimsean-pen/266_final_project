His eyes pull me down so deep in a black hole
He fogs my mind slow, we're covered in smoke
Turn off my protection, invite me to your world
That's a hunt for each other, the winner will take it all
(It's easy to love)
(It's easy to love)

I wanna hit the sky
I wanna hold you tight
We go out of control
We go out of control
It's easy to love
It's easy to love

I'm revealing your dark side
Your dirty secrets wrap up my mind
I'm here to know you from inside
Give me a sign, give me a sign
I won't be shy if you're brave enough
I will not hide, it's not a bluff
We are so in love, in love
(It's easy to love)

I wanna hit the sky
I wanna hold you tight
We go out of control
We go out of control
(It's easy to love)

Boy, lose yourself, we'll leave the ground
One crazy touch will melt me now
We'll soar above the stars are down
No prohibition
Take the crown
