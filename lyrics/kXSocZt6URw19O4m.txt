Hey! Come over to the passenger side
I promise this: eternal bliss
A kiss will ease your pain
Descend into the shattering tide
In the abyss ephemeris
A kiss will ease your pain

Hey! Come over to the passenger side
I promise this: eternal bliss
A kiss will ease your pain
Descend into the shattering tide
In the abyss ephemeris
A kiss will ease your pain

Steady! I think you're ready, Betty
See the moon behind the black confetti
When the mourning chimney swallow croons under fluorescent skies
Steady! I think you're ready, Betty
Say hello to the man with the black machete
When the diamond hits the silver spoon
Open up your eyes
Steady! I think you're ready, Betty
See the moon behind the black confetti
Silver linings in the hollow noon

Under fluorescent skies

Steady! I think you're ready, Betty
Say hello to the man with the black machete
When the diamond hits the silver spoon
Open up your eyes
Steady! I think you're ready, Betty
See the moon behind the black confetti
When the mourning chimney swallow croons under fluorescent skies
Steady! I think you're ready, Betty
Say hello to the man with the black machete
When the diamond hits the silver spoon
Open up your eyes
Steady! I think you're ready, Betty
See the moon behind the black confetti

Silver linings in the hollow noon
Under fluorescent skies

Steady! I think you're ready, Betty
Say hello to the man with the black machete
When the diamond hits the silver spoon
Open up your eyes
Steady! I think you're ready, Betty
Steady! I think you're ready, Betty
Lover! Lower me down!
