Have you ever done so much drugs
That you thought that your face
Will melt of to access
Cesspool of love
Cesspool of love
A cesspool of love
Have you ever ever stayed in a techno rave with the DJ's grave. ...
But you are scared away
By cesspool of love
Cesspool of love
Cesspool of love
Cesspool of love
Uuuuuhhhuu yeah yeah yeaahhaa
Uuuuuhhhuu yeah yeah yeaahhaa
Uuuuuhhhuu yeah yeah yeaahhaa
Swimming in a gridiron sending oh a shifting
Cesspool of love
Cesspool of lovers and haters and guilty masturbators
Cesspool of love?... and dying and laughing and crying
Cesspool of love
cesspool of love
cesspool of love
