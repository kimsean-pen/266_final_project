Number one on my speed dial
I changed your name so my friends won't find out
But they're all heading home now
And I got word that she's hanging downtown
I know I shouldn't do it
Oh, but these shots I'm shooting
Make me not give a damn

And now it's one more last time
We swore we wouldn't
But it's one more sunrise breaking through these curtains
And I know when we're sober we'll both say, it's over
But it ain't really over
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later

Two for one's on a Tuesday
Bartender poured 'em too strong 'cause he knows me
Then I take out my phone, find out if she's at home
'Cause I need someone to drink with

And now it's one more last time
We swore we wouldn't
But it's one more sunrise breaking through these curtains
And I know when we're sober we'll both say, "it's over"
But it ain't really over
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later

I know I shouldn't do it
Oh, but these shots I'm shooting
Make me not give a damn

And now it's one more last time
We swore we wouldn't
But it's one more sunrise breaking through these curtains
And I know when we're sober we'll both say, "it's over"
But it ain't really over
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
