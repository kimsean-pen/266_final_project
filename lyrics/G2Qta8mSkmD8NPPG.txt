Here I am, strolling down Atlantic Avenue
With the sunlight in my eyes
Here I am, and there's nothing I would rather do
When I want some peace of mind
I leave the smoke of Rio behind, as the evening starts to fly
I want to feel the ocean breeze, where the mountains kiss the sky

So come on, down Atlantic Avenue
Let the samba take a hold of you
'Cause I know there is no place like the Avenue
When the music gets a hold of you

Dive along to Ipanema there's always time to spare
Forget the troubles of the world, when they get to much to bear
Won't you please come on Atlantic Avenue

Flying down to Rio
Never thought I would be, walking by the ocean
here today, no
Pretty soon I've got to leave, but I know my heart will stay, ooh
Atlantic Avenue
Here I am strolling down Atlantic Avenue
Here I am, and there's nothing I would rather do
When I want some peace of mind
So come on, down Atlantic Avenue
Let the samba take a hold of you
Here I am strolling down Atlantic Avenue
Here I am, and there's nothing I would rather do
When I want some peace of mind
So come on, down Atlantic Avenue
Let the samba take a hold of you
