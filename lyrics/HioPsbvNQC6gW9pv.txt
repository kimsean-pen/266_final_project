My clothes were scratching at nothing
And they started to break the skin
I was waiting for something
And something was happening

I let the light in
It was ready to take me
Turn and face my enemy
I'm here in the running
I felt it coming
Now it's bursting out with energy
Energy, energy, energy...

You're my secret weapon
We're out to get 'em
Everyone's under attack
It's my secret weapon
There's nothing better
No-one's gonna battle back

Every time I look into the mirror
I see beyond what I could see
Things becoming clearer and clearer
No monster started looking at me

I let the light in
It was ready to take me
Turn and face my enemy
I'm here in the running
I felt it coming
Now it's bursting out with energy
Energy, energy, energy...

You're my secret weapon
We're out to get 'em
Everyone's under attack
It's my secret weapon
There's nothing better
No-one's gonna battle back

You're my secret weapon
We're out to get 'em
Everyone's under attack
It's my secret weapon
There's nothing better
No-one's gonna battle back

Make it happen now
Make it happen now
Make it happen now

You're my secret weapon
We're out to get 'em
Everyone's under attack
It's my secret weapon
There's nothing better
No-one's gonna battle back

You're my secret weapon
We're out to get 'em
Everyone's under attack
It's my secret weapon
There's nothing better
No-one's gonna battle back

You're my secret weapon
We're out to get 'em
Everyone's under attack
It's my secret weapon
There's nothing better
No-one's gonna battle back
