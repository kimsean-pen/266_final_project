Rise through the gate, Iak Sakkath
From depths beyond the sky
The realm of evil gods
Painful... they eat your mind

Evil undisguised
Breathe in pain
Blackened souls remain

Ghouls who pray the death of god
Destroy Jehovah's church
Vomit upon the cross
And burn the book of lies

Yog Sothoth evil one
Come forth and taste the blood
Infant entrails
Are hung upon the twisted cross
