I swear I'm single but this kid is on my mind
He's always wearing loafers
But I guess he's kinda nice
I'm not in love but it's a good waste of my time
I mean, who really like sublime?
Oops we did it again
I'm on your pillow
Oops we did it again
Why can't I say no?
He's not the smartest, I mean almost looking for
But damn the body of LeBron

We don't tell nobody, no one knows
But when the lights go down, down we go

Whatever happened to you buying a house
Burning the couch, you moving out?
Whatever happened to you getting a car
Living abroad, smoking cigars?
You said that you'll be drinking Dom Perignon
Turning me on with Louis Vuitton
Whatever happened to you buying a house
Burning the couch, you moving out?

He thinks O.J. Simpson's innocent
Trump's an okay President
Not saying that I'm into it
But his thing is magnificent
Never cleans a single dish
At least that guy is well quipped
Not saying that I'm into it
But his thing is magnificent
Oops we did it again
I'm on your pillow
Oops we did it again
Why can't I say no?
I'm not in love but it's a good waste of my time
And that body on my mind

We don't tell nobody, no one knows
But when the lights go down, down we go (lights go down)

Whatever happened to you buying a house
Burning the couch, you moving out?
Whatever happened to you getting a car
Living abroad, smoking cigars?
You said that you'll be drinking Dom Perignon
Turning me on with Louis Vuitton
Whatever happened to you buying a house
Burning the couch, you moving out?

He's not cool, but it's easy, easy
He's not cool, but it's easy, easy

We don't tell nobody, no one knows
But when the lights go down, down we go

Whatever happened to you buying a house
Burning the couch, you moving out?
Whatever happened to you getting a car
Living abroad, smoking cigars?
You said that you'll be drinking Dom Perignon
Turning me on with Louis Vuitton
Whatever happened to you buying a house
Burning the couch, you moving out?

He's not cool, but it's easy, easy
He's not cool, but it's easy, easy
We don't tell nobody, no one knows
But when the lights go down, down we go
