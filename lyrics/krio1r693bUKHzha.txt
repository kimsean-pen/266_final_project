I know she said,
That I don't need her,
cause everytime I call,
she's sitting sweeter,

I know she said,
to get near her,
but I'm feeling cold,
and I must leave her.

Sat down here with my head hung down
and I just seem to find
a bit of peace,
a bit of love,
a bit of something left behind.

Sat down here best intentions,
nothing said, nothing lied,
a bit of peace,
a bit of love,
a bit of something left inside.

And my heart's content,
I say that to please her,
happiness is on her face,
it's the mind that greets her,
only my disgrace,
to admit I need her,
but we all fall from grace,
dust me down and keep her.

Sat down here with my head hung down
and I just seem to find
a bit of peace,
a bit love,
a bit of something left behind.

Sat down here best intentions,
nothing said, nothing lied,
a bit of peace,
a bit of love,
a bit of something left inside.

We shant go on, in this way.
Cause we can't go on living this way.

Cause we can't go on living this way.
(We can't go on...)
(Because we can't go on living this way...)
