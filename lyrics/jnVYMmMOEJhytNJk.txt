7: 42 in the morning
8 seconds before it all sinks in
Put your best face on for the world
And fake another smile and just pretend

But you're just puttin' off the pain
Nothing's ever really going to change

So let it hurt, let it be
Let it take you right down to your knees
Let it burn to the worst degree
May not be what you want but it's what you need

Sometimes the only way around it
Is to let love do its work and let it hurt
Yeah, let hurt

3: 28 in the morning
Counting up the spaces between the rain
You're getting used to the rocks at the bottom
Your heart goes numb but the lonely stays the same

And that's price you're bound to pay
And there's really nothing anyone can say
Oh, there's only just one way

So let it hurt, let it be
Let it take you right down to your knees
Let it burn to the worst degree
May not be what you want but it's what you need

Sometimes the only way around it
Is to let love do its work
So go on yeah, let it hurt

You might just find your better for it
When you let go and you learn
To let let it hurt, let it bleed
Let it take you right down to your knees

Hey, sometimes the only way around it
Is to let love do its work (let love do its work)
So go on (go on) and let it hurt
Oh, let it hurt

7: 42 in the morning
8 seconds before it all sinks in
