Here I am, bring it right away
I'm don't doubt it's what you meant to say
Far enough, let's take a few things back
All my love, but I'm about to crack

Didn't see you for a while
Didn't notice it for quite sometime

See me off, gather all your stuff
Not enough, but that's all you got

Tell me why we're not getting it
It's alright, but I still wanna quit

Can you tell me where to be
Do you know what this all means to me
The intentions hard to know
And I don't want what you just let go

I've gone overboard, can you reel me in
It's a lot to know, and I can't begin

Had enough for what I knew
Had enough to know that it's not true

Hear me out, I'm about to fade
I've no doubt you meant that way

There's a place we don't wanna go
Does it taste like you oughta know

Didn't see you for a while
I've been so wrapped up for quite some time
Can you tell me who'll I'll be
Do you know what this all means to me

Can you get me out
Can you pull me through
And if there's a doubt
It's what I gotta do
