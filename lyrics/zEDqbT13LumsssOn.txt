I saw you coming, miles away
Stormy weather, heard them say
Turn around, you're playing with fire, fire, fire
Going faster, leaving crown,
Sky above, looking down
In your arms I wanna go higher, higher, higher
All I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want

All I want is you, you
All I want is you, you
All I want is you, you
All I want is you,
All I want is you,

All I want is you, you
All I want is you, you
All I want is you, you
All I want is you,
All I want is you,

I can't remember my life before,
A day without you, imá¹—ossible
Pull me in, into your river, river, river
Slipping under, you're in control
Take my heart, take it all, all
You're making me shiver, shiver, shiver

All I want is you, you
All I want is you, you
All I want is you, you
All I want is you,
All I want is you,

All I want is you, you
All I want is you, you
All I want is you, you
All I want is you,
All I want is you,

Cause all I want is you, is you,
O-o-oh
All I want is
O-o-oh
All I want is you,
All I want is you,

All I want is you, you
All I want is you, you
All I want is you, you
All I want is you,
All I want is you,

All I want is you, you
All I want is you, you
All I want is you, you
All I want is you,
All I want is you
