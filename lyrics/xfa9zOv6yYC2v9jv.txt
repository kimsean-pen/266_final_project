ohhhhhhhh,
ohhhhhhh,
fear is a curse,
the terror of twilight,
the fear of the nighttime,
a curse,
peace will come,
there are people that love you,
you don't have to do this alone,

(chorus)
well nothing seems to matter
your whole world seems to shatter
i'll keep you alive
well everything is nothing
it always turn to something
if you give it time
when emptyness surrounds you
and there's no one else around you
let me be your light
when its barely together
it's you and me forever
you keep this in mind

don't take it back babe
it's about not giving up baby
please wake up
there are people who love you
you don't have to do this alone

(chorus)
well nothing seems to matter
your whole world seems to shatter
i'll keep you alive
well everything is nothing
it always turn to something
if you give it time
when emptyness surrounds you
and there's no one else around you
let me be your light
when its barely together
it's you and me forever
you keep this in mind

Don't turn your back baby
it's about not giving up baby
the world will drive you crazy

(chorus)
(chorus)
well nothing seems to matter
your whole world seems to shatter
i'll keep you alive
well everything is nothing
it always turn to something
if you give it time
when emptyness surrounds you
and there's no one else around you
let me be your light
when its barely together
it's you and me forever
you keep this in mind
