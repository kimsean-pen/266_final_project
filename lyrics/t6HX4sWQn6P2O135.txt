Some say I'm moving
From the wrong clough
That I'm lost
But I'm on a reveling out
Got lose ends
Coming out

And if you close your eyes now
You can keep the world out
And if you close your eyes now
You can keep it spinning around

When I'm lost in the woods
When the darkness is coming
The storm is all around
Can you hear me cry?
If I'm lost in the woods
When the darkness is coming
The storm is all around

Feel like I'm floating
Down the river
That I know
Twisting and turning
When my head's gone down below

And if you close your eyes now
You can keep the world out
And if you close your eyes now
You can keep it spinning around

When I'm lost in the woods
When the darkness is coming
The storm is all around
Can you hear me cry?
If I'm lost in the woods
When the darkness is coming
The storm is all around
Can you hear me cry?

If I'm lost in the woods
When the darkness is coming
The storm is all around
And can you hear me cry?

If I'm lost in the woods
When the darkness is coming
The storm is all around
And can you hear me cry?

Can you hear me cry?

Can you hear me cry?
