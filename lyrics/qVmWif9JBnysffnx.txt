I don't care what my teachers say
I'm gonna be a supermodel
And everyone is gonna dress like me
Wait and see
When I'm a supermodel
and my hair will shine like the sea
And everyone will wanna look just like me
meee

Cause I'm young and I'm hip and so beautiful
I'm gonna be a supermodel
(2x)

I wish that I was like Tori Spelling
With a car like hers and dad like hers
And I, would show them how how it was done
That'd be fun, that'd be fun

And I wrote my school report,
On why I love my jeans, why I love my jeans.
And oh, oh my lockerdoor it's the coolest thing
That you have ever seen.

Cause I'm young and I'm hip and so beautiful,
I'm gonna be a supermodel
(2x)

I didn't eat yesterday,
I'm not gonna eat today
I'm not gonna eat tomorrow
Cause I'm gonna be a supermodel!

So beautiful (Beautiful)
I'm gonna be a supermodel
Cause Im young and Im hip and so beautiful (Beautiful)
I'm gonna be a supermodel
(4x)

I'm gonna be a supermodel!
