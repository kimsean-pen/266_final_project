They say don't go to bed angry
They say always kiss goodnight
Maybe there's somethin' to it
I don't know, but what if they're right
If we're gonna be forever
If it's gonna be just us
If we're gonna ride together
Turn two to one

Gotta make it work, I'm not sayin' it's easy
Sometimes we get hurt, I promise I ain't leavin', yeah
There's gonna be a couple fights
Just to see who's wrong or right
If it's love we both know what it's gonna take
Work
Yeah, we can make it work

I've seen the things that happen
One side self destructs
I've seen the beautiful madness
When things erupt

Gotta make it work, I'm not sayin' it's easy
Sometimes we get hurt, I promise I ain't leavin', yeah
There's gonna be a couple fights
Just to see who's wrong or right
If it's love we both know what it's gonna take
Work
Yeah, we can make it work

Can't always be there for ya
Can't always be by your side
But I promise that I'm gon' love ya
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die

Gotta make it work, I'm not sayin' it's easy
Sometimes we get hurt, I promise I ain't leavin', yeah
There's gonna be a couple fights
Just to see who's wrong or right
If it's love we both know what it's gonna take
Work
Oh no, yeah, we can make it work
