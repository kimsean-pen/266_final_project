Long looks and slow moving lights on the ceiling
And I swore again and again
Never again
Never again

All of my fears
Coming to life
All of my time
Wanting you near
At my side

Your heart is still beating in all of my dreams
And I swore again and again
Never again
Never again

All of my fears
Coming to life
All of my time
Wanting you near
At my side
