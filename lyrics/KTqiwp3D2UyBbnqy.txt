You've got it in the palm of your hands
(Your hands)
It's slipping through your fingers like sand
(Like sand)
'Cause they don't understand who you are
(You are)
Doesn't matter long as I am your star
(Star)

Yeah, I know that I need the gold
But what I love can't be bought or sold

Don't think I want what I used to want
Don't think I need what I used to need
Don't think I want what I used to want
Don't think I see what I used to see

I've been waiting, waiting for the penny to drop
(To drop, to drop, to drop)
I've been working, working to get back what I lost
(I lost, I lost)
I lost
But whatever happens, I'll be okay
(I'll be okay)
'Cause fortune's running out of my veins, my veins
You can't take away the Midas' touch
So you better make a way for a Greek gold rush

Don't think I want what I used to want
Don't think I need what I used to need
Don't think I want what I used to want
Don't think I see what I used to see

In El Dorado, your gold
To Colorado can't be bought or sold

Now, there's no moral to this story
But I can hear my freedom calling me, calling me

I don't care that everybody knows
I'm a million dollars in the hole
I don't care that everybody knows
Baby, I don't even want your gold

From El Dorado, your gold
To Colorado can't be bought or sold

Gold rush
Gold rush
Free, free, free, free, free, I am free
