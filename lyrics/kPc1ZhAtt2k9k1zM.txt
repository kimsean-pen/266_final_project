You're never gunna save those soul suckers
You're never gunna save those soul suckers
You're never gunna save those soul suckers
You're never gunna save those soul suckers

Beautiful
They said they did not want my face in their magazine
'Cause I'm not beautiful
Am I the most fucking fantastic freak
You've ever seen? Did I make you scream?

Do we make you sick?
Do our imperfections make your blue breath run thick?
Give me scars and stripes
It does not please me to be easy on any of your eyes
Any of your eyes

Beautiful, Beautiful Is Boring
Beautiful, Beautiful Is Boring
Beautiful, Beautiful Is Boring
Beautiful, Beautiful Is Boring

You're never gunna save those soul suckers
You're never gunna save those soul suckers

Fall flawless to the floor
Shady lady gave me 'Ketones' so I might be decor
Just pass me my cigar
Teaching children to be anything
Other than who they are, who they are

Beautiful, Beautiful Is Boring
Beautiful, Beautiful Is Boring
Beautiful, Beautiful Is Boring
Beautiful, Beautiful Is Boring

You're never gunna save those soul suckers
You're never gunna save their souls
You're never gunna save those soul suckers
You're never gunna save those soul suckers
You're never gunna save those soul suckers
You're never gunna save their souls

Beautiful, Beautiful Is Boring
Beautiful, Beautiful Is Boring
Beautiful, Beautiful Is Boring
Beautiful, Beautiful Is Boring
