Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah

Why do I love you so much
When you're a love killer
Why do I give you my love
When you're a love killer

You gave me butterflies
And then you shot them down
Straight out the sky
You make my heart take off
To kick it on the ground
You don't even try

You-u have got better options but you-u
Are all that I want is just you-u, you-u
Keep doing the things that you do
Got me like... why?

Why do I love you so much
When you're a love killer
Why do I give you my love
When you're a love killer
Baby, baby you're like the worst drug
But you're a buzz killer
You're a love, you're a love killer
I'm in love with the love killer

Obliterate my trust
Assassinate my dreams
You're nothing but cold
But baby I just know
That no one in the world
Could love you if I don't

You-u have got better options than you-u
And all of my friends they hate you-u, you-u
Cause all of the things that you do
Got me like... why?

Why do I love you so much
When you're a love killer
Why do I give you my love
When you're a love killer
Baby, baby you're like the worst drug
But you're a buzz killer
You're a love, you're a love killer
I'm in love with the love killer

La-la-la la-la love
You want some more
I'm a love killer
La-la-la la-la love
You want some more
I'm a love killer

Why do I love you so much, yeah
Why do I love you so much

Why do I love you so much
When you're a love killer
Why do I give you my love
When you're a love killer
Baby, baby you're like the worst drug
But you're a buzz killer
You're a love, you're a love killer
I'm in love with the love killer

Why do I love you so much
When you're a love killer
Why do I give you my love
When you're a love killer
Baby, baby you're like the worst drug
But you're a buzz killer
You're a love, you're a love killer
I'm in love with the love killer
