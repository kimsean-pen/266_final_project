Sometimes I give into sadness
Sometimes I don't
At times I'm part of the madness
Sometimes I won't give into you
You've seen the way I have been drifting down a river to nowhere
And you give me nothing

But if your ready to be my everything
If your ready to see it through this time
If your ready for love then
This I will bring
But I'm not gonna wait for you forever
This time

At times I feel myself smiling
At times I'm not
What's with that guilt that your styling
Baby talk don't look good on you
You see the way I've been looking for a reason to go there
And you leadin' me nowhere

But if your ready to be my everything
If your ready to see it through this time
If your ready for love then
This I will bring
But I'm not gonna wait for you forever
This time

Are you waiting for a special occasion
To give me your heart
'Cause I need a little confirmation
To make a real start
Don't wait till it's too late
Are you ready to show me
Are you ready to love me

You see the way I have been drifting down a river to nowhere
And you give me nothing
But if your ready to be my everything
If your ready to see it through this time
If your ready for love then this i will bring
But I'm not gonna wait for you forever
This time

And if your ready to be
Ready to be my everything
And if your ready to see it through this time
If your ready for love
Then baby this i will bring
But I'm not gonna wait forever
This time
