When I'm not with you
I feel so incomplete
When I'm not with you
I feel so empty inside

불안해하는 나를 절대 혼자 두지 마
Don't you go and leave me here all alone

I don't show it but
I need you more than you think
그저 함께 있고 싶을 뿐이야

I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you

When I'm not with you
I really don't feel right
곂에 없으면 난 너무 불안 해져

혼자 서는 아무것도 할 수 없을 것 같아
If we are together we can do anything
Why are you not around me?
When I need you the most
그저 함께 있고 싶을 뿐이야

I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you

I want you to be my side
So I will never fell alone again

I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you
