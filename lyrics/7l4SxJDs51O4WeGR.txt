You are so far away
And it strains on me to hear your voice everyday.
You never know what you have until you're gone
To hear your voice everyday!
You never know what you have until you're gone
So when it's over and I'm on way my back home
It feels like days and days before I'm next to you again.

This is how we love.

You're so far away
And this is where I'll always be
on the road that doesn't end
and the views that never cease
with a feeling bittersweet.
Counting down the days(You're so far away), we're counting down the days(This is how we love).

Beat up and broken down
From the wear of it all
But I can barely notice because this means too much to me.
You're so far
so far away.
This means too much to me.

You're so far
You're so far
You're so far
You're so far away.

And this is where I will always be
On the road that doesn't end
And the views that never cease
With a feeling bittersweet.

So counting down the days(you're so far away)
we're counting down the days.

This is how we love.

I believe I can take this strain.
You never know what you have until you're gone
You're far away
But this is where I will always be.
This is where I will always be!
This is where I will always be!

So when it's over
And I'm on my way back home
I realize I'll be gone in another day
But twenty four hours can last me for months.
Maybe I can't take this strain.

I have thought about it every night
(And this is where I will always be)
In different places where I rest my mind
(On the road that doesn't end)
And when I'm waking it all remains.
You never know what you have until you're gone
But you're the reason for me
That I can do this consistently.
So far away.
This is how we love.
You're so far away.
This is how we love.
