Girl my body don't lie
(Red One)
I'm out of my mind
Let it rain over me
(Mr. Worldwide)
I'm rising so high
Out of my mind
(Marc Anthony)
So let it rain over me

Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me

Always a new million
Always a new vodka
Forty is the new 30
Baby you're a rockstar
Dale veterana, que tu sabes
Mas de la cuenta, no te hagas
Teach me baby, or better yet,
Freak me baby, yes, yes
I'm freaky, baby, I'ma make sure that your peach feels peachy, baby
No bullshit broads, I like my women sexy, classy, sassy
Powerful yes, they love to get a little nasty, ow
This ain't a game you'll see, you can put the blame on me
Dale munequita abre ahi, and let it rain over me

Girl my body don't lie
I'm out of my mind
Let it rain over me
I'm rising so high
Out of my mind
So let it rain over me

Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me

Always a new million
And always a new vodka
Light is the new majority, ya tu sabe

Next step la casa blanca
No hay carro, nos vamos en balsa
Mami you know the drill, they won't know what I got 'til they read the will
I ain't tryin', I ain't trying to keep it real
I'm trying to keep wealth and that's for real
Pero mira que tu estas buena, y mira que tu estas dura
Baby no me hables mas, y tiramelo mami chula
No games you'll see, you can put the blame on me
Dale munequita abre ahi, and let it rain over me

Girl my body don't lie
I'm out of my mind
Let it rain over me
I'm rising so high
Out of my mind
So let it rain over me

Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me

Mr. Worldwide, Marc Anthony, tu sabe
I was playing with her, she was playing with me
Next thing you know, we were playing with three
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

I was playing with her, she was playing with me
Next thing you know, we were playing with three
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Rain over me

Girl my body don't lie
I'm out of my mind
Let it rain over me
I'm rising so high
Out of my mind
So let it rain over me (over me)

Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me (over me)
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me (Woo)
