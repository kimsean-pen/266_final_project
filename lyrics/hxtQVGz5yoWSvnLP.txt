I will tell you the truth
I wanna take your youth
I wanna drink from you
Your blood tastes so sweet
Like sugar baby, like sugar baby

Demons say, "I deserve your DNA"
Be awake, forever for you I wait
It's okay, it's okay you go away
It might take your life to pay
Pay him with the razor blade
Tell me what you want to say
I can't take the truth today
So tell me a fairy tale
Heavens say I'm on my way
I don't care what heavens say
I'm waiting for your embrace

You don't want me do you?
You don't want me do you?
Know what I'll do to you
Wish I never knew you
I wanna know what you do when I'm gone

Your blood tastes so sweet
Like sugar baby, like sugar baby
Your blood tastes so sweet
Like sugar baby, like sugar baby
