Rain keeps falling down, down
Into the rivers of life
Into the oceans of this world
And back up into the sky

Mountains of gold
Are shrinking in time
They vanish into space
Revealing your true face

What is the meaning of All-that-is
Just for a start
I can feel your smile
Right in my heart

Time is calling name by name
Come back to me
Enchanted by the sound
The soul swirls around and round
Time is calling name by name
Come back to me
Enchanted by the sound
My soul bursts into flames

Rain keeps falling down, down
Into the rivers of life
Into the oceans of this world
And back up into the sky

Down on the ground
Everything goes cold
High up in the sky
There is no place to hide

Time is calling name by name
Come back to me
Enchanted by the sound
The soul swirls around and round
Time is calling name by name
Come back to me
Enchanted by the sound
My soul bursts into flames

When you fell onto the ground
I came to warm you
Nothing seems real
It's just about what you feel

I am calling name by name
Come back to me
Enchanted by the sound
The souls burst into flame
