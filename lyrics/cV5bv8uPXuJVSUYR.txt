Let go!

Choose the passion you awoke in me
The fire alive, the courage to see
An unexamined life isn't worth living
Trust what's in your heart and keep searching

You set me, you set me free

Time moves only when I have your hand in mine
In mine
The sky burns brighter when I look into your eyes
Your eyes

I can't let go
Your presence, the beauty you hold
It carries my soul, carries my soul
I find safety in your bones
Your bones
You are my strength, you are my breath
You are the life that precedes death

You set me, you set me free

Time moves only when I have your hand in mine
In mine
The sky burns brighter when I look into your eyes
Your eyes

Our love will burn until the end of time

Live, love, learn
Live, love, learn

Bury me in
Bury me in
Bury me in
Bury me in this love

Time moves only when I have your hand in mine
In mine
The sky burns brighter when I look into your eyes
Your eyes

Our love will burn until the end of time

Live, love, learn
Live, love, learn
