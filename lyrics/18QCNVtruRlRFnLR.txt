I'm staying out for the summer
Playing games in the rain
The hills and the fortune
Got me fooled again

You see I work in a factory (I need the money)
I don't want to be late (Though I hate this place)
I got my debts to pay for (Free me from this race)
They're going to have to wait

If I ever see you again
I will tell you why (Tell you why)
I was low and insecure
I didn't want to make you cry

Well my good's turned bad
And it's just my luck that
You're not on my side
So what happens now? Where did you go?
With these feelings I hide?

Staying out for the summer!

I've had enough lining
Pockets I've never met
They've got me working all hours
I ain't gained nothing yet

If I ever see you again
I will tell you why (Tell you why)
I was low and insecure (If I ever see you cry)
I didn't want to make you cry

Well my good's turned bad
And it's just my luck that
You're not on my side
So what happens now? Where did you go?
With these feelings I write?

I'm staying out for the summer
Playing games in the rain
The hills and the fortune
Won't be the same again

I'm staying out for the summer
I'm staying out for the summer
I'm staying out for the summer
