Disease, disease
Spreading the disease
With some help from Captain Trips
Bringing the world down to his knees
Power, yes, power
He'll show them all his power
It pulses through his ice cold blood
A whole world to devour
He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy, he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living
Murder, murder
Commit cold blooded murder
Like Nazis during World War II
They only follow orders
Hatred, hatred
The crucifix is your bed
Once he turns his eyes on you
You'll be better off dead
He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy, he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living
I'm the walking dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with the power
Among the living, follow me or die
Man fights man
Divided they can't stand
United, they can battle back
And make him force his hand
Fear, yes, fear
His end is growing near
He didn't count on man's good faith
Or the will to persevere
He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy, he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living
I'm the walking dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with the power
Among the living, follow me or die
Oh, fire, hot fire
Purge the world with fire
Damnation is the price he'll pay
For an evil man's desire
Good versus evil
The stand to vanquish evil
Man can only live one way
That place right in the middle
He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy, he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living
I'm the walking dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with the power
Among the living, follow me or die
Among
Among
Among...
