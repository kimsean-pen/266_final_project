There's poison in the boys in blue
There's poison in the boys in blue...
Corruption, greed and feud are all I see!

You're in a disarray
Things used to be a different way
Whatever happened to the golden age?

It's gone, yeah, it's gone away...
So don't ever turn your back again...
(One false move and we're all dead.)

Here I am
Here I am
Here I am.
I'm back at the crossroads again...
Oh, let me stand, let me stand, let me stand
On top of the mountain again!

There's movement in the distance
Gunshots are what I hear
This petty resistance is all I see!

I want to walk away...
Remember better days...
We watch the death of something beautiful!

It's gone, yeah, it's gone away...
So don't ever turn your back again...
(One false move and we're all dead.)

Here I am
Here I am
Here I am.
I'm back at the crossroads again...
Oh, let me stand, let me stand, let me stand
On top of the mountain again!

When we find a problem
We never look back and say
"One chance, one moment
It's gone so easily!"

Well, here I am
Here I am
Here I am...
I'm back at the crossroads again...
Oh, let me stand, let me stand, let me stand
On top of the mountain again!
Oh, here I am
Here I am
Here I am...
I'm back at the crossroads again...
Oh, let me stand, let me stand, let me stand
On top of the mountain again!
