I didn't want to go
Go back and look for you
But it's a heartless drug
I'm addicted to

And when I drive that road
And start to feel that chill
I think I see your face
Do you come here still?

Those were the times and these were the places
Your love was so good
And now that I'm here I suddenly find
I'm tumbling backward

I'm back to where I was before
Dreaming of glory in your love
And now I'm laying on your floor
Crashed on the surface of your love

The chemicals react
The molecules collide
The poison works its way
Somewhere down inside

There we were young
I really believed love would never leave us
But time has a knack of
Pulling the rug out from underneath us

And nothing matters anymore
I'm still a victim of your love
And now I'm banging on your door
Time rolling backwards with your love
Over and over with your love

I know they're only ghosts and memories that I'm clutching at
Maybe I'm reaching back for something I never had
Still it seemed so real to me
These ragged threads that lead me back to you
Losing my mind, waiting for you

I'm back to where I was before
Time rolling backwards with your love
And now I'm laying on your floor
Crashed on the surface of your love

Where the other dreams we had
Fractured and frozen with your love
You put a spell upon me there
Never be broken with your love
Nowhere to run to but your love
Over and over with your love
