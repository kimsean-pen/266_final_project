no more rain in this cloud
no more rain in this cloud
[1] - my sunshine has come
and i'm all cried out
and there's no more rain in this cloud
My sunshine has come
and i'm all cried out
and there's no more rain in this cloud
There's no hiding place
when someone has hurt you
it's written on your face, and it reads
"broken spirit, lost and confused"
"empty, scared, used and abused, a fool"
oh, ain't it funny that the way you feel
shows on your face
(it's written all over your face, yeah)
and the smile you used to wear
seems a little bit out of place
(tracks of your tears)
people oh, hold on
in time it gets a little better, whoa
[repeat 1]
So you want to live and to you i shall give
all the space that you requested
hope you don't live to regret it
So you say you're in your prime
baby, don't waste your time
remember my love, it's only a thin line
(it's never too late)
[repeat 1]

Spring has come and winter's gone, my love
but don't look around for me, child
i'll be gone (i'll be gone, gone, gone, gone)
not afraid because the seasons have changed
i'm gonna count my blessing then just follow the sun
cuz you see
[repeat 1 while:]
now, i wanna take a minute to kick it like this
y'all wit' me? y'all know what i'm talkin' about?
you know what to do
there's no hiding place
when you're hurting
no, no, no
Baby, don't want teardrops
drying up on my pillow
(i used to think the world of you)
only room for raindrops
don't belong on my smile
(baby)
and there's no rain in this cloud
(there's, there's nothing i would not do)
Baby, don't want teardrops
drying up on my pillow
(you broke me down)
only room for raindrops
don't belong on my smile
(you broke me way down)
and there's no more rain in this cloud
(you you you, baby broke me down)
[repeat 1 while:]
what goes around, comes around
what goes up, must come down
things you do, come back to you
y'all believe that?
goes around, comes around
what goes up, must come down
