Counting the time
Waiting for the crime
The loss of innocence
A faint reminiscence

I'm in the twilight
Surrounded by the night
The memories have been disgraced
The scene is still unchanged

The time is near
The messgae is clear
The battle will be fought
Fight now. Fear not.

I keep stil
I am trying to feel
The hate that's within you
Im going to win you

I was mistaken
I was forgotten
Unbroken silence
Absolute violence

I praise the song of defeat
I am the bottom and he's the summit
A sorrowfull farewell
Where does salvation dwell?
