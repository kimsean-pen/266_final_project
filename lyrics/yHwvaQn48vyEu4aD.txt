If,
If I,
If I ever wander on by
Could,
Could you,
Flag me down and beg me to
Drop what I'm doing and sit beside you

So did,
Did they ditch us and leave us with nothing to say
Where,
Where we,
Where we will wait for friends and family
To pass away or come in handy

Oh,
Oh dear,
A rotten summer, a rotten hope, dear
Where, where we wait for to lose our friends and family
To fame and fire, to dame or dandy
To pass away or come in handy
