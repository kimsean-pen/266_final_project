Out in the streets no more

Out in the streets no more
Because these people they give me
They give me the creeps

It's the worst
Because there's just nothing
That's worth the cost
Cause it's the worst

I don't wanna
Cause it's the worst
It's the worst

I just don't wanna go
Out in the streets no more
I just don't wanna go
Out in the streets no more
Because these people they give me
They give me the creeps

Because these people they give me
They give me the creeps

Too many creeps
