What the fuck?
Put your teeth to the curb, 'cause right now I'm gonna stomp your fucking face in
I hope you drown in all the cum you fucking swallow, to get yourself to the top
You're just a trend, just a fucking disease
How could you look at yourself in the mirror? (Mirror)
You stand for nothing and your heart is untrue
Every single thing about you's just a clone of the last "you"
All I want is to reach someone
To say something that could change their life forever
To let them know they're not alone, you're not alone
So many people wanna see me fail
So fucking clever but I'll spit in your face
I'll make sure you remember me

If all these words you speak of meant a thing
I'd take back all the lines against you that I sing
But I know that there's nothing real inside
Your heart's invested in feeding everyone lies

I've seen so many of you come and go
That's cause you're in it for all the wrong fucking reasons
You can't expect to live off of lies and survive
I am who I am, this is what we are
I don't care if this offends you, or your worthless god
To all the kids who's letters I receive
The broken-hearted, the damaged just like me
I will be your voice to let the world know we stand as one
We're standing right here so come and fucking get us

Open your mind before your mouth
Or come and fucking get us
Open your mind before your mouth
I'll be the end of your decadence

If all these words you speak of meant a thing
I'd take back all the lines against you that I sing

If all these words you speak of meant a thing
I'd take back all the lines against you that I sing
But I know that there's nothing real inside
Your heart's invested in feeding everyone lies

I may not have built this kingdom but
I'll make fucking sure that I protect it from you
