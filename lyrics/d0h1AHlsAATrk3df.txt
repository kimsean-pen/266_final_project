Worship the ground that you walked on below your pedestal
My mind put you on to a throne soon enough I'll outgrow

Didn't know my feet were too big for my shoes
Running in them led me to bruise
Falling over, running home to you
You had both my fingers and toes turning blue
So afraid of cutting me loose
You're holding on to me
You're holding on

Due west, I'm headed on this road
Due west, just cruise as far as I can go to
California, California, California
Never looking back, goodbye
A list of all the reasons why I wear them through
I do it all for you

Oh oh ohhh
Oh oh ohhh

Bare feet against all the broken cement left untended
Picking the flowers of the old picket you've mended

Didn't know my feet were too big for my shoes
Running in them led me to bruise
Falling over, running home to you
You had turned me fingers and toes turning blue
So afraid of cutting me loose
You're holding on to me
You're holding on

Due west, I'm headed on this road
Due west, just cruise as far as I can go to
California, California, California
Never looking back, goodbye
A list of all the reasons why I wear them through
I do it all for you

Oh oh ohhh
Oh oh ohhh
Oh oh ohhh
Oh oh ohhh
(do it all)

Due west, I'm due
Due west, for you
Due west, Cali, Cali Cali
As far as I can go to California, California, California
