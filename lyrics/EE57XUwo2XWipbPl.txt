One day, one night, one moment

My dreams could be tomorrow
One step, one fall, one falter
East or West
Over earth or by ocean

One way to be my journey
This way could be my

Book of days
No day, no night, no moment
Can hold me back from trying
One flag, one fall, one falter
I'll find my day maybe
Far and away
Far and away
One day, one night one moment

With a dream to be leaving
One step, one fall, one falter
Find a new world across a wide ocean
This way became my journey
This day brings together
Far and away
This day brings together
Far and away
Far and away
