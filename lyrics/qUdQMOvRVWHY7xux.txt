We used to laugh
we used to cry
we used to bow our heads then
wonder why
but now you're gone
i guess i'll carry on
and make the best of what you've left to me
left to me, left to me
I need you
like the flower needs the rain
you know, i need you
guess i'll start it all again
you know, i need you
like the winter needs the spring
you know i need you
i need you
And every day
i'd laugh the hours away
just knowing you were thinking of me
then it came
that i was put to blame
for every story told about me
about me, about me
I need you
like the flower needs the rain
you know, i need you
guess i'll start it all again
you know, i need you, i need you
I need you
like the winter needs the spring
you know i need you
Guess I'll start it all again, you know
i need you, i need you
I need you like the flower needs the rain
You know i need you
Guess I'll start it all again, you know
I need you, I need you, I need you
Like the winter needs the spring
You know I need you
Guess I'll start it all again, you know
I need you, I need you, I need you
