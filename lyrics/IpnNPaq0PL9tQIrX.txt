Yesterday I told my sons
Sometimes the bad guys win
And that it made me scared about the world that we live in
But I had to reassure them that it wouldn't be for long
Sons we have to be ourselves
We have to be strong

I said, Boys you are the future, so let this be a lesson
There may come a day you have to fight off their aggression
Cause fear and hatred won today, the darkness ate the light
But both of you look in my eyes, it'll be all right

In every step you take
I'm with you all the way
Cause I would die for you
And do what's right for you
In hopes that when I'm gone
You'll carry on
These words I wrote for you

'Til then...
I'll sing

Stand your ground
Don't let the bastards grind you down
Be bold, be strange
Don't let their fears make you afraid
There's hope
They'll change

Well I looked out to the world today, thought What a bloody mess!
They stripped our morals from us, put 'em under house arrest
Liberty and country are the words they need to speak
A little God, a little freedom, if we don't agree we're weak

And every politician stood there idle and so smug
Empowering the racists and Second Amendment thugs
Wall Street and the billionaires, convinced us they're so smart
Screaming, Vote with your wallets, instead of with your hearts!

But we won't go away!
You won't forget our name!
The pussy generation, the PC and the brave
The protesters that slink along these streets of misery

And so...
I'll sing

Stand your ground
Don't let the bastards grind you down
Be bold, be strange
Don't let their fears make you afraid
There's hope, we'll change
We'll change
We'll change

No, no, no, no, no
We say, No, no, no, no, no
Fuck no!
No, no, no, no, no
Fuck no!

So give us all your fuckers, all your niggas, and your spits
Give us all your Muslims, the so-called terrorists
We'll welcome 'em with open arms and put 'em in our mix
We're better off together now, embrace our difference

Remember there is love!
Our words can stop their guns
Forget the rednecks
Living in the past
We're never going back now, we've reached critical mass!

And so...
I'll sing

Stand my ground
Won't let the bastards grind me down
I'm bold, I'm strange
Won't let their fears make me afraid
There's hope, they'll change
