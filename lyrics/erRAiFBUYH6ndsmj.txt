If sleep's the cousin of death
Relieve me of all of my stress
I've been waiting for you to put me to rest

Two for joy, one for sorrow
She said "I loved you yesterday, but I can't love you tomorrow"

The gentle hands of time tie your hands to mine
Once love is canonised, the spark you once had dies
You've been waiting, to wake from the neverend

Two for joy, one for sorrow
She said "I loved you yesterday, but I can't love you tomorrow"
Too little, too late is all that I will ever be
When you sleep forever, dream of me

When all is said and done
We ache in unison
Your absence - bittersweet
It lingers, always

Me and you were joy
I am sorrow
She said "I loved you yesterday, but I can't love you tomorrow"
Too little, too late is all that I will ever be
When you sleep forever, dream of me
