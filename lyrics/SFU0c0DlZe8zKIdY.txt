Joseph walked on and on
The sunset went down and down
Coldness cooled their desire
And dawn said, 'let's build a fire'
The sun dressed the trees in green
And joe said, 'i feel like a king'
And dawn's neck and her feet were bare
Sweetness in her golden hair
Said, 'i√≠m not scared'
Turned to her and smiled
Secrets in his eyes
Sweetness of desire
Is this desire
Enough enough
To lift us higher
To lift above?
Hour-long, by hour, may we two stand
When we're dead, between these lands
The sun set behind his eyes
And joe said, 'is this desire? '
Is this desire
Enough enough
To lift us higher
To lift above?
Is this desire
Enough enough
Enough inside
Is this desire
