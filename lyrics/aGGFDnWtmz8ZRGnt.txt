You can be
Whatever u want
When you're high
Walk slowly
With a spirit by your side
(Oh baby)
Don't fear if u lose your mind
Say how u doin' boy I'm feelin' fine
... when somethin' carries me away... hey hey hey hey...

Don't think
Just take a ride
Don't believe
That jesus lied
To keep us all so satisfied
With a sale

U should know baby

Don't feel
The thorny nights
Never ask
For holy rites
Don't ya think

That god has died
This time

And don't stop
Takin' these drugs cuz' they

Got u flyin' forgettin' yesterday
Maybe it's crazy but keep gettin' stoned while u can

Baby in the lord's hands

You can be
Whatever u want

When you're high

Walk slowly
With a spirit by your side
(Oh baby)
Don't fear if u lose your mind
Say how u doin' boy I'm feelin' fine

... when somethin' carries me away... hey hey hey hey...
Don't say
U know what's right
Don't take
Those alibis
Don't hate
The other side
When they're right
Sure they are baby
Don't wave
Your flag up high
Don't praise
Your concubines
Did u just
Fall for lies
This time
And don't stop
Takin' these drugs cuz' they
Got u flyin' forgettin' yesterday
Maybe it's crazy but keep gettin' stoned while u can
Baby in the lord's hands
You can be
Whatever u want
When you're high
Walk slowly
With a spirit by your side
(Oh baby)
Don't fear if u lose your mind
Say how u doin' boy I'm feelin' fine
... when somethin' carries me away... hey hey hey hey...
(0h 0h 0h - Oh Oh)
(0h 0h 0h - Oh Oh Oh)
(Oh Oh Oh)
(0h 0h 0h - Oh Oh)
(0h 0h 0h - Oh Oh Oh)
(Oh Oh Oh)
And don't stop
Takin' these drugs cuz' they
Got u flyin' forgettin' yesterday
Maybe it's crazy but keep gettin' stoned while u can
Baby in the lord's hands
You can be
Whatever u want
When you're high
Walk slowly
With a spirit by your side
(Oh baby)
Don't fear if u lose your mind
Say how u doin' boy I'm feelin' fine
... when somethin' carries me away... hey hey hey hey...
