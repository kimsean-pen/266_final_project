Holding on to secrets
Gripping handle bars on the road
Racing home at sunset
With the last light into the glow

Ooh, I let you love me right back
Ooh, it's easy how we lose track

We talk all night, we talk all day
Wish I could meet you on the other side
The bedroom lights keep us awake
Wish I could meet you on the other side
On the other side
On the other side
On the other side
On the other side
(The other side, oh yeah)

Taking in this moment
Say "I love you" under my breath
Though your heart is stolen
It's like your voice is right in my hands

Ooh, I let you love me right back
Ooh, it's easy how we lose track

We talk all night, we talk all day
Wish I could meet you on the other side
The bedroom lights keep us awake
Wish I could meet you on the other side
On the other side
On the other side
(The other side, the other side)
On the other side
On the other side

On the other side
On the other side, yeah
On the other side
