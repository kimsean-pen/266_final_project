I wanna kiss you
But if I do, then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play
A LoveGame, a LoveGame

Just wanna touch you for a minute
For a minute, for a minute, for a minute
Hold me and love me

For a minute, for a mi-i, mi-i

And it involves some heavy touching, yeah
You've indicated your interest
I'm educated in sex, yes
And now I want it bad, want it bad
A LoveGame, a LoveGame

I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth, and your hand on your huh!
The story of us, it always starts the same
With a boy, and a girl, and a huh, and a game

And a game, and a game, and a game
And a game, and a game, and a game
And a game

Game, play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
