Oh yeah, maybe, baby
Get the heebie jeebies
Got the shakes
And I got a funny feelin'
That you got just what it takes
And, oh, yeah, maybe, baby
Maybe, baby, I'm fallin' in love
Gee, you make me lovesick
That's for sure
And I got a funny feelin'
I don't wanna find a cure
And, oh, yes, maybe, baby
Maybe, baby, I'm fallin' in love, in love
I don't need a doctor
Need no pills
And I got a funny feelin'
And the fever and the chills
And, oh, yes, maybe, baby
Yes, yes, yes, maybe
I'm fallin' in love, in love, oh, yeah
