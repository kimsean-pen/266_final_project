If you're evil and you're on the rise,
You can count on the four of us taking you down,
Cause we're good and evil never beats us,
we'll win the fight and then go out for pizzas,
We are the crystal gems.
We'll always save the day,
and if you think we can't,
We'll always find a way,
Thats why the people of this world believe in.
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl and Steven .

If you could only know what we really are
When we arrived on earth
From beyond your star
We were amazed to find
Your beauty and your worth
We will protect your kind
We will protect your earth
We will protect your earth

We will protect you

I will fight for the place where im
Free
To live together and exist as me
I will fight in the name of Rose Quartz
And everything that she believed in
And I will fight for the world where I was made
The earth is everything ive ever known
And I will fight for all beings
The world needs me where loyal
The odds are against us it will not be easy but not be alone.
We are the crystal gems.
We'll always save the day,
and if you think we can't,
We'll always find a way,
Thats why the people of this world believe in.
