Inside
You know
It's not
Your Fault
There comes a time
For all we've got inside
Feel it forming now
Soul free guide to light

Hear you call out
For sweet time
Through the sunbeams
You cry
All you've wanted will work out fine
The world is soft

In time
You know
You've got
It all

Hear you call out
For sweet time
Through the sunbeams
You cry
All you've wanted will work out fine
The world is soft
