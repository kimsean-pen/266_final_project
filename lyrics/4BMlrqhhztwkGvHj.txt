Word I bring... (From far up North!)
Songs I sing... (From your nephew's court!)
Convened Thing... (On the death of Harthacnut!)
Proclaimed king... (And the Danes salute!)

"End your exile! Your claim to the throne is strong!
Sweyn's your ally! Us Swedes will fight along!"

Norway awaits me
It's time to cross the North Sea
First I must break free
We could ask Constantine

I'm needed elsewhere
"No way! My troops, I cannot spare."
This seems quite unfair...
"Can't you hear? My answer is NO."

My Basileus, my emperor,
I have honorably served this kingdom
Sand I have won, and furthermore,
Blood of Saracens have flowed by my work of sword

My Basileus, my emperor,
You have left me no choice but to escape
Taking my men, and from the hall,
We are breaking our way out after nightfall

"This is insane, we're trapped in the Sound!"
Row for all you're worth, despair to mirth
"The chain will not break, there's no way around!"
Over shall we go, so hasten now...!
From stern to bow...!
Tilt the galley over,
For no emperor nor chain will stand in my way

Man the oars!
Out to sea!
Bid farewell and wave goodbye,
Because gentlemen--
We are heading home!

Rising...
A new day rising...
New kingdoms await
New lands there to take
Your son's heading home

He's a viking
The last of the vikings
With chests full of gold, new tales to be told,
Your king's heading home...
