Who knew bliss was such a risk?
All the thoughts I have I'm too scared to express
Unless they're gonna fit the mold of some critical prick

Stay away, decay
Before I go insane
Just stay away, decay
Before I lose my mind today

I won't turn and look away
When it's all you wanna say
No one's ever gonna censor me
You're the coward
You're the thief
And that's all you'll ever be
No one's ever gonna censor me

I'm insane
I know I'm sick
I have a twisted mind
But I've learned to live with this viciousness
And I think I'm loving every second of it

Stay away, decay
Before I go insane
Just stay away, decay
Before I lose my mind today

I won't turn and look away
When it's all you wanna say
No one's ever gonna censor me
You're the coward
You're the thief
And that's all you'll ever be
No one's ever gonna censor me

Are these metaphors too much of a risk
Well, this spit on my lips is venomous piss
I hope it leaves your brain burning for hours
Now turn your moaning down
Crank this music up louder

Crank this music up louder

I won't turn and look away
When it's all you wanna say
No one's ever gonna censor me
You're the coward
You're the thief
And that's all you'll ever be
No one's ever gonna censor me
