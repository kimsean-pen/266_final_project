Trademark the revolution
Swallow your sin and bury your soul
This is your retribution
The end of all that you know

We come as we are
We are what you're not
We come as we are
We are what you're not

So let the fire rise!

Run, you can't escape me
I am the air that fills your lungs
Fall, you are the disease
But I'm immune to all you've done

Take back what's ours, take back
We're taking back this world

So say your goodbyes
We're at an all out war
The world won't survive
But I'll chose how I die tonight
So say you're alive one last time

And let the fire rise
Rise, rise, rise
Wipe the ashes from your eyes and rise, rise, rise
Every end is a start's disguise

We're holding on to tomorrow
The day our flag will ascend
We are the voice of the hollow
We are the start of your end
We are the start of your end!

So say your goodbyes
We're at an all out war
The world won't survive
But I'll chose how I die tonight
So say you're alive one last time

And let the fire rise!
Rise, rise, rise
'Cause we chose how we die tonight
