Baby you let me down
I'm closing the door
I can't bear to see
Your sweet eyes anymore
Every second that I stay
I'm sinking further in
To your clever little games
And the heartache that they bring

Don't you know by now
When I scream out loud
That I'm done with you
And the things you do
I can't run or hide
From your love or lies
Can I win a war
When you're changing sides

Every time you tear me down down
Tear me down down
With your wrecking ball heart
Baby tear it apart
It's like
Every time you tear me down down
Tear me down down
With your wrecking ball heart
Baby tear it, tear it
Picking up parts of me

Scattered on the floor
Reckless love is strong
I wish my soul was more
Terrified and scared to death
I'm searching for a way
To keep you more in check
Hear what I gotta say

Don't you know by now
When I scream out loud
That I'm through with you
And the things you do
I can't run or hide
From your love or lies
Can I win a war
When you're changing sides

Every time you tear me down down
Tear me down down
With your wrecking ball heart
Baby tear it apart
It's like
Every time you tear me down down
Tear me down down
With your wrecking ball heart
Baby tear it, tear it

Baby now I'm taking cover
You're my destructive lover
Baby you are like no other
Wrecking all of us
Baby now I'm taking cover
You're my destructive lover
Baby you are like no other
Wrecking all of us
Wrecking all of us
You're wrecking all of us
With a wrecking ball
With a wrecking ball
Do you really want to wreck us all
With a wrecking ball
With a wrecking ball
Wreck it all

Every time you tear me down down
Tear me down down
With your wrecking ball heart
Baby tear it apart
It's like
Every time you tear me down down
Tear me down down
With your wrecking ball heart
Baby tear it

Every time you tear me down down
Tear me down down
With your wrecking ball heart
Baby tear it apart
It's like
Every time you tear me down down
Tear me down down
With your wrecking ball heart
Baby tear it, tear it

Don't you know by now
When I scream out loud
That I'm done with you
And the things you do
I can't run or hide
From your love or lies
Can I win a war
When you're changing sides

Every time you tear me down down
Tear me down down
With your wrecking ball heart
Baby tear it apart
It's like
Every time you tear me down down
Tear me down down
With your wrecking ball heart
Baby tear it apart
