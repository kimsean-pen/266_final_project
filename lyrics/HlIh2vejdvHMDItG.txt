Black is black
I want my baby back
It's grey, it's grey
She'd be where today?

Oh-oh now, what can I do?
'Cause I-I-I-I-I
I'm feelin' blue

If I had my way
She'd be where today?
If I had my way
She'd be where today?

Oh-oh now, what can I do?
'Cause I-I-I-I-I
I'm feelin' blue

'Cause I-I-I-I-I
I'm feelin' blue
