Don't know why
I'm always waiting
Wishing you would show up at my door

"No, that's a lie
You were always hidden
Nothing more"

Dans le noir
Gasp and sigh
Dans le noir
Where we die

My little heart
Is barely working
A flicker in a fog, a fading charm

"You never tried
Always out there waiting"

I wanna see you in the dark

Dans le noir
Gasp and sigh
Dans le noir
Where we die
