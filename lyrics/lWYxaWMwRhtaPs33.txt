Photograph, remembering the summer
It takes me back
To Southern California

Where the girls would all pass
On the boardwalk and laugh
At our desperate attempts and our sunburned backs
We never had a chance, I remember that
And no matter what we do
We'll never lose what we had

Growing up
Won't bring us down
Yeah, growing up
It won't bring us down
Growing up won't bring us down

Growing up won't bring us down
Graduate, what's a kid to do now?
Get away, yeah-ah
We've got so much to prove
'Cause it's time to move on
And I start to let go
But then Wonderwall comes on the radio
I flashback to the night in your parent's yard

When we drank too much and we talked about God
Growing up
Won't bring us down
Growing up
It won't bring us down
We're in this together
Yeah, we'll make it somehow
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Growing up won't bring us down

Growing up won't bring us down

Growing up won't bring us down
Photograph
Oh, give me something to remember
Growing up
Won't bring us down
Growing up
It won't bring us down
We're in this together
Yeah, we'll make it somehow
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Growing up won't bring us down
Growing up won't bring us down (won't bring us down)
Growing up won't bring us down (won't bring us down)
Growing up won't bring us... down
