If it's alright for you
Think it's alright when I'm near
Tell me that lovers falling down the drain
'Cause if I'm being honest with you
If I'm being honest to you
I think we don't match with passion, bring down

Hello, hello
Hello, hello
'Cause all the things I found down with you
It's only making stuff out of blue
All of these feelings chaining out
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm tired of waiting, tired of waiting, tired
So tired of waiting, so tired of waiting
Of waiting, of waiting, of waiting, so tired, so tired
So tired of waiting, so tired of waiting
So tired of waiting, so tired of waiting
So tired of waiting, so tired of waiting
So tired, so tired
Of waiting, of waiting, of waiting
So tired, so tired
