It's so hard when people knock you down
And tell you that you're never gonna get a shot at glory
But that's when you rise to the challenge
'Cause it's your time, your moment
And nothing can stop us now

PTX, get up! What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit

Get up! Fresh out thrift shop walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like rocky and cosby
Sweatergang nope nope y'all can't copy

Yup. Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on broadway, ha and we do it, our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into
Everything I record and yep yep yep yep I'm on

Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T 'cause ha
Chasing dreams since we were 14
With the four track
Bussing halfway cross that city with the backpack
Fat cat, crushing

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Nah, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that's what you get when Texas raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on shark week

Oh, raise those hands, this is a party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility, we keep marching

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

And so we put our hands up
Let's go!

Na na na-na na na na na, oh
And so we put our hands up
Na na na-na na na na na, oh
And so we put our hands up

Na na na-na na na na na, oh
And so we put our hands up
Na na na-na na na na na, oh

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us (Like the ceiling can't hold us)
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up
LIke the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
