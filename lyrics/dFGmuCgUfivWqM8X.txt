Wadu-aidu-wadaidu!

There's a song
You're trembeling to it's tune
At the request of the moon

Licking her chops
She looks at the lunatics
She needs another fix

I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smoking
I'm just fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read

I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smoking
I'm just fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
Only a crazy little thing I read

Maybe the planets are trying to become the stars
And we really came from Mars
The Earth is alive and man is a parasite
And heavenly bodies make us fight

I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smoking
I'm just fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read

I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smoking
I'm just fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
Only a crazy little thing I read
