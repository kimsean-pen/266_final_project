Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me
Town to keep me moving, keep me grooving with some energy
Well, I talk about it, talk about it, talk about it, talk about it
Talk about, talk about, talk about moving
Gotta move on
Gotta move on
Gotta move on

Won't you take me down to funkytown
Won't you take me down to funkytown
Won't you take me down to funkytown
Won't you take me down to funkytown
