Ah, ah, ah-duh-ah-uh
Ah, ah, ah-duh-

This is how it works
It feels a little worse
Than when we drove our hearse
Right through that screaming crowd

While laughin' up a storm
Until we were just bone
Until it got so warm
That none of us could sleep

And all the styrofoam
Began to melt away
We tried to find some worms
To aid in the decay

But none of 'em were home
Inside their catacomb
A million ancient bees
Began to sting our knees

While we were on our knees
Prayin' that disease
Would leave the ones we love
And never come again

On the radio
We heard "November Rain"
That solo's real long
But it's a pretty song

We listened to it twice
'Cause the DJ was aslee-eep

Bum-bu-bu-bu-bum

This is how it works
You're young until you're not
You love until you don't
You try until you can't
You laugh until you cry
You cry until you laugh
And everyone must breathe
Until their dyin' breath

No, this is how it works
You peer inside yourself
You take the things you like
Then try to love the things you took

And then you take that love you made
And stick it into some
Someone else's heart
Pumpin' someone else's blood

And walking arm in arm
You hope it don't get harmed
But even if it does
You'll just do it all again, and

On the radio
You'll hear "November Rain"
That solo's awful long
But it's a good refrain

You listen to it twice
'Cause the DJ is asleep
On the radio (Oh-oh-oh)
On the radio
On the radio, uh-oh
On the radio, uh-oh
On the radio, uh-oh
On the radio-oh-ohhh
Mmm-mm
Bum-ba-dum-ba-dum-bum
Bum-ba-dum-ba-dum-bum
Ba-da-dum
Ba-da-dum
Ohh-oh
Ah, ah, ah-duh-ah-uh
Ah, ah, ah-duh-ah-uh
Ah, ah, ah-duh-ah-uh
Ah, ah, ah-duh-ah-uh
Ah, ah, ah-duh-ah-uh
Ah, ah, ah-duh-ah-uh
Ah, ah, ah-duh-ah-ah
