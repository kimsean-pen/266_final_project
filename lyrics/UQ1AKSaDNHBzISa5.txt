Ain't got no memory
Memory me empty
I write like a leftie
Please do not right me

Ain't got no memory
Memory me empty
I write like a leftie
Please do not right me

I write like a leftie
Please do not right me

People saying that you're my note
Put you down as my antidote
Put you down as my antidote
Put you down as my antidote

People saying that you're my note
Put you down as my antidote
Put you down as my antidote
Put you down as my antidote

Ain't got no memory
Feelings got me empty
I write like a leftie
Please do not right me

Do not right
Do not right me
Me
Right me
Do not right me
Do not right me

Ain't done right
I ain't know what is right
Left seems so colorful
So jump in my pot of gold

People saying that you're my note
Put you down as my antidote
Put you down as my antidote
Put you down as my antidote

People saying that you're my note
Put you down as my antidote
Put you down as my antidote

Moving all the love I'm a kingpin
My girl says I'm tripping
Moving all the love I'm a kingpin
My girl says
My girl says I'm tripping
My girl says I'm tripping
My girl says I'm tripping

Call me up on a saturday
Call me up and I'm saying hey
Blink slow and you look down

When we're together
I can't see past
The signs at the mall that say loser come last
'Cause we could be losers and that'd be a first
'Cause when I am with you I do not feel hurt

What do you have over me
Nothing more that I wanna see
I could go so far away
But you'd just go as far as me

What do you have over me
Nothing more that I wanna see
I could go so far away
But you'd just go as far as me

Go as far as me
Go as far as me
Go as far as me
Go as far as me
Go as far as me
Go as far as me
Go as far as me
Go as far as me
