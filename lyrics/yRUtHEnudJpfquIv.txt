Where is your next show? In Honolulu

Do we get to go there for free?
Do we get to go there for free?
Do we get to go there for free?
Oh yes we do, but not with you.

Oh Everett true, who are you?
Who is gonna put in our tape-deck,
Who is gonna carry the bass-amp,
Who is gonna buy us a van?

It could be you,
It will come ture, oh.
