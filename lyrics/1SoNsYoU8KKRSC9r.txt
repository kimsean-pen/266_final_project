Baby, you know that I like to be right
But I'm hoping this time, baby, I'm wrong
Baby, you know I'm loving you skin tight
But I'm thinking this time, you want me to run

When she calls,
Tell me truth
Tell me truth,
Is it more than I knew?
I knew

So are you home tonight?
Are you alone tonight?
I've been drinking and I'm thinking that I don't wanna fight
Are you home tonight?
Are you alone tonight?
You've been drinking and I'm thinking
Are we sinking?
Yeah, I just wanna fight
I just wanna fight

Darling I know it wasn't the first time
I went outta my mind, hoping for more
Darling you know, that this is the last time
You don't get to come round, begging for more

Tell me truth
Tell me truth,
Is it more than I knew?
