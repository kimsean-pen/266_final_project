She's calling to me
She's wanting my life
She'll take you away

Sea's calling to me
She's turning the tide
Of my life

To the sea, pray
Wash it away
To the sea, moan
Sink like a stone

She's calling to me
She's haunting my life
She'll take you away
Sea's calling to me
She's turning the tide
Of my love

To the sea, pray, save me
Wash it away
To the sea, moan
Swim like a stone

Her siren song
Her lies,
Her disguise,
Her salt in my eyes
Her tide that night

Unholy night...
