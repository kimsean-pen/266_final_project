Knock, knock... are you alone?
No one's out here and I was not followed
Love, love... you're already home
Party's over and you don't look so good

You find your way back down
And I'll keep the area clear (please clear the area)
When you find your way back down - in one piece
Then I'll just be waiting here - (right here) right here (right here)

Low light, mercury morning
No need to stay as it's always nothing
But your eyes tell a whole other story
And I feel the weight of the world
You won't talk (won't talk)
You won't try (won't try)
Just move (won't move)
It's too still in your sadness
Cry (cry)
Give up (give up)
It's okay (it's okay)
You've just got to trust me

You find your way back down
And I'll keep the area clear (please clear the area)
When you find your way back down - in one piece
Then I'll just be waiting here - (right here) right here (right here)

Slowly (slowly)
Darling (darling)
Nobody means any more to me than you
If you're in (if you're in)
Baby, then I'm in (into this)
With you always
Careful (careful)
Close to the edge (you're scaring me)
Fall in to my arms (away with it all)
Fall (fall) into love
Love

You find your way back down
And I'll keep the area clear (please clear the area)
When you find your way back down - in one piece
Then I'll just be waiting here - (right here) right here (right here)

You find your way back down (way back down)
And I'll keep the area clear (so, please clear the area)
When you find your way back down - in one piece
Then I'll just be waiting here - (right here) right here (right here)
