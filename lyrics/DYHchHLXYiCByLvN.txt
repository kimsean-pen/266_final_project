The music's no good without you, baby
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me

The music's no good without you, baby
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me

Everyone was watching
You were the freakiest thing on show
Dazzle in the crystal ball
They only love to watch it glow

You were the center of attention
The eye of the storm
A whirlwind from outer space
Like a twister on the scene

The music's no good without you, baby
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me

The music's no good without you, baby
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me

You mesmerized them when we danced
'Cause you could sparkle next to me
We sit along the razor's edge
But you were crazy to be free

I agonize till you'll come back
And we'll dance that close again
I miss you, boy, I really do
Come back to me, come back to me

'Cause my world stopped spinning
Nothin' I can do
So I pray that a D.J. lifts my heart

The music's no good without you, baby
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me

The music's no good without you, baby
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me

The music's no good
The music's no good
The music's no good
Come back to me
The music's no good

But I know you don't need me anymore
There's no good dwelling in the past
I have to live each day
Like it was my last
