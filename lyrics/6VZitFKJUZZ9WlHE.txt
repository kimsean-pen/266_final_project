I get lost with you.
I dogwalk with you around the block.
I get by with you.
I get high with you best I can.

I'd do anything to make you feel.

I wanna cry with you.
I wanna die with you once or twice.
I wanna lie with you until the pain is through for a while.

I'd do anything to make you feel.
You must've took me for a walk cause I'm short of breath.
You must've stomped right up and scared away my death.
