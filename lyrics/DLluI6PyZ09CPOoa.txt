Is anybody out there
Does anybody see
That when the lights are off something's killing me

I know it seems like people care
'Cause they're always around me
But when the day is done and everybody runs

Who will be the one to save me from myself
Who will be the one who's there
And not ashamed to see me crawl
Who's gonna catch me when I fall

When the show is over
And it's empty everywhere
It's hard to face going back alone
So I walk around the city
Anything, anything to clear my head
I've got nowhere to go nowhere but home

Who will be the one to save me from myself
Who will be the one who's there
And not ashamed to see me crawl
Who's gonna catch me when I fall

It may seem I have everything
But everything means nothing
When the ride that you've been on,
That you're coming off
Leaves you feeling lost

Is anybody out there
Does anyobdy see
That sometimes loneliness is just a part of me.

Who will be the one to save me from myself?
Who will be the one who's there
And not ashamed to see me crawl
Who's gonna catch me when I fall
Who's gonna catch me when I fall
Who's gonna catch me when I fall
And not ashamed to see me crawl
Who's gonna catch me when I fall
