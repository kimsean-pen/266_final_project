Standing on the edge of tomorrow
Standing on the edge of tomorrow
Standing on the edge of tomorrow
Standing on the edge of tomorrow
Standing on the edge of tomorrow

This time could be the last time
Maybe the only time to get it right
In this dystopian generation
Damnable situation
We've got to make it right

Gravity just won't hold us down
Our journey's begun we tear through the clouds
Leaving all that we know far behind

Standing on the edge of tomorrow
Standing on the edge of tomorrow
Standing on the edge of tomorrow

New world gotta be a new world
Not like the old world
We have left behind
This time could be the last time
Maybe the only time
We've got to get it right

Piercing the veil from a tiny blue star
We've found a new home
Watched from afar
Leaving all we love far behind

Standing on the edge of tomorrow
Standing on the edge of tomorrow
Standing on the edge of tomorrow
Standing on the edge of tomorrow
Standing on the edge of tomorrow
Standing on the edge
