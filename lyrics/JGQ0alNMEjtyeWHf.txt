I can't sleep because its burning deep inside
Like gasoline on a fire running wild
No more fear cause I'm getting closer now
So unreal but I like it anyhow

I go faster faster faster faster faster faster faster

I can't live in a fairytale of lies
And I can't hide from the feeling cause its right
And I go faster faster faster and faster for life
I can't live in a fairytale of lies

I can feel that you mesmerize my heart
I Feel so free I'm alive I'm breaking out
Won't give in, because I'm proud of all my scars
And I can see I've been wasting to much time

I go faster faster faster faster faster faster faster

I can't live in a fairytale of lies
And I can't hide from the feeling cause its right
And I go faster faster faster and faster for life
I can't live in a fairytale of lies
And I can't live in a fairytale of lies
And I can't hide from the feeling cause its right
And I go faster faster faster and faster for life
I can't live in a fairytale of lies
A fairytale of lies
