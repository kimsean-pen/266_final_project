He's a fairy feller
The fairy folk have gathered 'round the new-moon shine
To see the feller crack a nut at night's noontime
To swing his axe he swears, as it climbs he dares
To deliver...
The Master-Stroke

Ploughman, "Waggoner Will", and types
Politician with senatorial pipe - he's a dilly-dally-o
Pedagogue squinting, wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown, dirty fellow
What a dirty laddio

Tatterdemalion and a junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter - he's my hero (Ah!)
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow (Can we see the Master-Stroke?)
What a quaere fellow

Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch-magician presides, he is the leader

Oberon and Titania watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen and there's a good apothecary-man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a quaere fellow
The ostler stares with hands on his knees
Come on, Mr Feller, crack it open if you please
