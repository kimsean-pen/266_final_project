I want to be in the movies
Your favorite kind of show
My baby already plays me every time that I go
And I could be in the movies
And you can be Rose McGowan
I feel like I'm famous
Every time we're alone, every time we're alone

Just me, must see
Drama donna upon a masterpiece
So I stay, on screen
Mama wanted me a vanity

I know that I can make you move
And when your tongue is tied, I'll talk you through
My baby said, I like your point of view
I want to watch it too

I want to be in the movies
Your favorite kind of show
My baby already plays me every time that I go
And I could be in the movies
And you can be Rose McGowan
I feel like I'm famous
Every time we're alone, every time we're alone

Just me, TV
Entertain your hilarity
So I stay, on screen
Shaking baking you up out your seat

I know that I can make you move
And when your tongue is tied, I'll talk you through
My baby said, I like your point of view
I want to watch it too

I want to be in the movies
Your favorite kind of show
My baby already plays me every time that I go
And I could be in the movies
And you can be Rose McGowan
I feel like I'm famous
Every time we're alone, every time we're alone

And I could be
And I could be
And I could be
And you could be
Rose McGowan
