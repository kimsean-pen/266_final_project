Everybody in the land of dreaming
Everybody in the land of dreams
Everybody in the land of dreaming
Everybody in the land of dreams
Oh oh living in the land of dreaming
Oh oh living in the land of dreaming

Baby baby can't you see
Only in your fantasy
You are really feeling free
Dreaming is the key
Take me away take me away
Take me with you to the stars
Take me away take me away
Take me with you to the stars

As I lay down
To close my eyes
Fantasy and inspiration flies
I lose control as it seems
And I start living
In the land of dreams

Everybody in the land of dreaming
Everybody in the land of dreams
Everybody in the land of dreaming
Everybody in the land of dreams
Oh oh living in the land of dreaming
Oh oh living in the land of dreaming

Baby baby you and me
Start me up set me free
What you need is to be
Wonderland for me
Take me away take me away
Take me with you to the stars
Take me a way take me away
Take me with you to the stars

Everybody in the land of dreaming
Everybody in the land of dreams
Everybody in the land of dreaming
Everybody in the land of dreams
Oh oh living in the land of dreaming
Oh oh living in the land of dreaming

As I lay down
To close my eyes
Fantasy and inspiration flies
I try to relax
And to free my mind
So I can leave everything behind
Pictures circle round my head
Some are good some are bad
I lose control as it seems
And I start living
In the land of dreams

Everybody in the land of dreaming
Everybody in the land of dreams
Everybody in the land of dreaming
Everybody in the land of dreams
Oh oh living in the land of dreaming
Oh oh living in the land of dreaming
Everybody in the land of dreaming
Everybody in the land of dreams
Everybody in the land of dreaming
Everybody in the land of dreams
Oh oh living in the land of dreaming
Oh oh living in the land of dreaming
