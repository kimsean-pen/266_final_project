Come on out, come on out,
Where'd you go, where'd you go?
I don't mean to play here
Figure out, figure out
What you know, what you know
Figure out how to say it clear

Cause you're more likely to get cut with a dull tool, than a sharp one
You, you stuck around,
You stuck around,
You stuck around,
Until you got me
Then, then you dropped me

Chorus:
You, you don't kiss when you kiss
You don't f*ck when you f*ck
You don't say what you mean
You don't talk loud enough
No pulse in your impulse
Celebration's impossible

You forgot the difference
Between equanimity and passivity
You forgot you have to try
You have to try, you have to try
You forgot that glorious feeling
That you get when you get the truth
So tell that girl you don't love her
And if you do, tell her two times
Cause you're more likely to get cut with a dull tool, than a sharp one

Chorus:
You, you don't kiss when you kiss
You don't f*ck when you f*ck
You don't say what you mean
You don't talk loud enough
No pulse in your impulse
Celebration's impossible

You, you don't kiss when you kiss
You don't f*ck when you f*ck
You don't say what you mean
You don't talk loud enough
No pulse in your impulse
Celebration's impossible

You, you don't kiss when you kiss
You don't f*ck when you f*ck
You don't say what you mean
You don't talk loud enough
No pulse in your impulse
Celebration's impossible when

You don't kiss when you kiss
You don't f*ck when you f*ck
You don't say what you mean
You don't talk loud enough
No pulse in your impulse
Celebration's impossible
Celebration's impossible
Celebration's impossible
Celebration's impossible
