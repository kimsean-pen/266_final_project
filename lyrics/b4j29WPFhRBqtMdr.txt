Soaking through
Colours that held us up against the wall
Soaking through
Colours that held us up against the wall

Hold your colours against the wall,
When they take everything away,
Hold your colours against the wall,
With me

Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes
Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes
Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes
Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes
Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes (Twisted the knife, til you were in the right place)
Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes (Twisted the knife, til you were in the right place)
Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes (Twisted the knife, til you were in the right place)
Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes (Twisted the knife, til you were in the right place)

Soaking through

Hold your colours against the wall,
When they take everything away,
Hold your colours against the wall,
With me (Soaking through)

Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes (Twisted the knife, til you were in the right place)
Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes (Twisted the knife, til you were in the right place)
Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes (Twisted the knife, til you were in the right place)
Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes (Twisted the knife, til you were in the right place)
Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes (Twisted the knife, til you were in the right place)
Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes (Twisted the knife, til you were in the right place)
Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes (Twisted the knife, til you were in the right place)
Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes (Twisted the knife, til you were in the right place)

But, she looked into your eyes,
And saw what lay beneath,
Don't try to save yourself,
The circle is complete,
In reaching out and into you,
Nothing else can touch me

Soaking through

Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes (Twisted the knife, til you were in the right place)
Twisted the knife, and opened your eyes (Twisted the knife, til you were in the right place)

Fading gently,
Soaking through,
And starting not to show at all
In reaching out and into you, nothing else could touch me

Hold your colours against the wall,
When they take everything away,
Hold your colours against the wall

Soaking through

Hold your colours against the wall,
When they take everything away,
Hold your colours against the wall,
With me.
