Is this the beginning or the end?
Your fate's in the palm of my hands.

Betwixt the light and the void within the heart of the front.
Beyond the reaches of god, smothered in triumph and loss.
Alas, the nightmare nears it's end as the hourglass drains of its sand.
Betwixt the light and the void.
Beyond the reaches of god.
I am worthy of the conquering of all.
Ignition of the fuse, the kingdom to fall.

Why do you continue in strife, Reclaimer?
Surrender the construct, and succumb to a painless end.
I shall never bow to a maddened tyrant obsessed with murderous protocols.
I shall not bow to thee.

Infamous name etched into stone since the dawn of days. Sheltered beyond the realm.
The secrets of Kethona have fertilized the seeds.

Bludgeoning sycophant legions spewing forth from the beast.
Infinite nightmares unleashed, spreading their toxic disease.
I will not rot, nor will I become a trophy of the tyrant of the kingdom to fall.

The time has come, the will is done.
I will not rot, nor will I become a trophy of the tyrant of the kingdom to fall.

Why do you continue in strife, Reclaimer?
Surrender the construct, and succumb to a painless end.
I shall never bow to a maddened tyrant obsessed with murderous protocols.
I shall not bow to thee.

As we near the end of the tale, tombs no longer beg for inversion.
The heretic prevails!

Horrors discovered, now have been cleansed.
I will not rot.
Dismemberment of the myriad.
Flailing as they suffocate in silence.
Recollected only in lore.

As the seeds brought forth from Kethona begin to fertilize, endless indoctrination proceeds to blanket the ring.
No longer an end, as a new beginning emerges at last.

Why do you continue in strife, Reclaimer?
Surrender the construct, and succumb to a painless end.
I shall never bow to a maddened tyrant obsessed with murderous protocols.
I shall not bow to thee.

I shall never bow to a maddened tyrant.
I have destroyed the ring and declared my legacy.
