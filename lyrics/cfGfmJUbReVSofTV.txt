You can choose the channel
When we're watchin' the T.V.
Oh, babe-it's okay
And you can pick the flavor
When we're orderin' ice cream
I don't mind and that's fine
I'd do-hoo-hoo-hoo
Anything for you-hoo-hoo-hoo

Ah, it's all right if you sleep with your socks on
Oh, babe! It's okay!
And you can hurt my head with your favorite rock song
I don't mind-yeah, that's fine

For you-hoo-hoo
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do-hoo-hoo-hoo
You can put a hole in my shoe

But in my car I'll be the driver
In my car I'm in control
In my car I come alive and
In my car I am the driver
Watch me now!

You can blame me when you run outta razors
Oh, babe it's okay!
And I will run around when you ask me for favors
I don't mind and that's fine

For you-hoo-hoo
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do-hoo-hoo-hoo
You can put a hole in my shoe

But in my car I'll be the driver
In my car I'm in control
In my car I come alive and
In my car I am the driver
Wou

I don't mind if you think you're the strong one, yeah
Oh, babe! It's okay!
And you can have your way, honey,
Even when you're wrong
I don't mind! Yeah, that's fine!

For you-hoo-hoo-hoo
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do-hoo-hoo-hoo
You can put a hole in my shoe

But in my car I'll be the driver
In my car I'm in control
In my car I come alive and
In my car

Not you-hoo-hoo-hoo, not you-hoo-hoo
Not you-hoo-hoo-hoo
Yeah, in my car I'll be the driver
