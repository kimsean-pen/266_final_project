Falling asleep
Dream sweet in the passenger seat
I am if you are
So we could get something to eat
Know a place where there's nothing to see
So we can just talk about what we wanna be
Work out we could work it out
Aye
But times not a thing
So roll down the windows and we can just sing
Like La La La
Not a worry in the world
And Blah Blah Blah
Blah
It's not really true but right now it is when I'm right here with you
We both look a mess but we couldn't care less by the way the we dress
Late to the party
I hope we have friends somebody
And you didn't even wanna die once this week
And when you're around I feel less of a freak
And when you smile for real you make me smile for real
So I don't care if it's not here or stay
Let's get some coffee so we stay awake
And when you smile for real you make me smile for real
And when you smile for real you make me smile for real
And when you smile for real you make me smile for real
And when you smile for real you make me smile for real
Falling easily how 'bout you take a seat with me
Worry on me and you shouldn't say sorry to me
So something that strange should have gotten away
I just shouldn't say what I wanted to say
Your makeup's running like you're runnin away
And it's not the best way to be ending the day
Nothing to say just disgard what we say
Now I'm lost and alone in this big white house on a hill
Some rude boy calls yoir name
I don't remember why we came
Cuz you didn't even wanna die omce this week
And when your around i feel less of a freak
And when you smile for real you make me smile for real
You're tryna find your heels
This lie isn't real
Fallin' asleep
Dream sweet in the passenger seat
Fallin' asleep
Dream sweet in the passenger seat
And you didn't even wanna die once this week
And when you're around I feel less of a freak
And when you smile for real you make me smile for real
So I dont care if it's not here or stay
Let's get some coffee so we stay awake
And when you smile for real you make me smile for real
And when you smile for real you make me smile for real
And when you smile for real you make me smile for real
And when you smile for real you make me smile for real
