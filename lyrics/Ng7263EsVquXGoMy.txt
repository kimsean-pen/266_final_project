Hey Mom, why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you teach me a thing or two?
You just let me go out into the world
You never thought to share what you knew

So I walked under a bus, I got hit by a train
Keep falling in love which is kinda the same
I've sunk out at sea, crashed my car, gone insane
And it felt so good I want to do it again

Hey Mom, why didn't you warn me?
'Cause about boys is something I should have known
They're like chocolate cake, like cigarettes
I know they're bad for me but I just can't leave 'em alone

So I walked under a bus, I got hit by a train
Keep falling in love which is kinda the same
I've sunk out at sea, crashed my car, gone insane
And it felt so good I want to do it again

I walked under a bus, I got hit by a train
And it felt so good I want to do it again
I wanna do it again, I wanna do it again
Oh, it felt so good

Hey Mom, since we're talking
What was it like when you were young?
Has the world changed or is it still the same?
A man can kill and still be the sweetest thing

I walked under a bus, I got hit by a train
Keep falling in love which is kinda the same
I've sunk out at sea, crashed my car, gone insane
And I felt so good I want to do it again

Under a bus, I got hit by a train
Keep falling in love which is kinda the same
I've sunk out at sea, crashed my car, gone insane
And it felt so good I want to do it again

Under a bus, hit by a train
And it felt so good I want to do it again
