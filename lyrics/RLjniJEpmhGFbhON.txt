Stop your clock
Fall underneath
To hear the steps
Of thunder
We take our heads and hold our hearts
In the dark
It's not over now

Home is lost
Walk into dark
We feel the past
From under
We take our heads and hold our hearts
From this light
It's not over now

Well I don't know if this treasure's in the ocean
Or if death will whisk me far away
I'd like to think that we live in a kind of motion
Where our hands and feet are here to stay

Break the fall
Spin into cold
The rain is kept
In silence
We take our heads and hold our hearts
In the dark
It's not over now

Well I don't know if this treasure's in the ocean
Or if death will whisk me far away
I'd like to think that we live in a kind of motion
Where our hands and feet are here to stay

Well I don't know if this treasure's in the ocean
Or if death will whisk me far away
I'd like to think that we live in a kind of motion
Where our hands and feet are here to stay
