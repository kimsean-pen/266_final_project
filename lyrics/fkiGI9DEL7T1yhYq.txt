"Devil's Paradise"

No I don't know
Know where you came
You came from bad
If you like
You can be my inspiration
In the day time or at night

Cause baby you shine like platinum ring
And if you want mine
I will show you off
And if you like to be held
I can hold you till the end of time

Cause you are the thing I need to do
Now I'm craving you Cause
you make all my wrongs feel right
Like a devil's paradise

You
I'm a little scared of you
Yeah I want you now
Cause your lips are the perfect crime
Like a devil's paradise

You take all my flaws
And make them priceless diamonds
I bet you're
You're an angel undercover
And I like it
Yeah I'm sure

Cause baby you shine like platinum ring
And if you want mine
I will show you off
And if you like to be held
I can hold you till the end of time

Cause you are the thing I need to do
Now I'm craving you
Cause you make all my wrongs feel right
Like a devil's paradise
You
I'm a little scared of you
Yeah I want you now
Cause your lips are the perfect crime
Like a devil's paradise
