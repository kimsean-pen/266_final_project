Animal, animal, am I lucky
Animal, animal, am I lucky
Animal, animal, am I lucky
How do you know of your animal soul?
How do you know?
You never will know

Animals, animals, and we're lucky
Animals, animals, and we're lucky
Animals, animals, and we're lucky
How do you know of your animal soul?
How do you know?
You never will know

Show me, blow me, I know who you are
Hide me, blind me, show me to the stars
(how we row, we row)
Slow me roll me hard
Slow your mojo, what are we feeling right now

Animals, animals, and we're lucky
Animals, animals, and we're lucky
Animals, animals, and we're lucky
How do you know if you're out of control?
How do you know?
You never will know

Show me, blow me, I want you to leave
Hide me, blind me, but I know who you are
(how we row, we row)
Show me how we are
Slow your mojo, what are we feeling right now

Animals, animals, and we're lucky
Animals, animals, and we're lucky
Animals, animals, and we're lucky
How do you know if you're out of control?
How do you know?
You never will know

Animals, animals, and we're lucky
Animals, animals, and we're lucky
Animals, animals, and we're lucky

Throw me far away, how you will see
Slowly, further then tell me what it means to be sane
Everybody knows, slow your mojo, what are we feeling right now

Animals, animals, and we're lucky
Animals, animals, and we're lucky
Animals, animals, and we're lucky
How do you know if you're out of control?
How do you know?
You never will know

Animals, animals, and we're lucky
Animals, animals, and we're lucky
Animals, animals, and we're lucky
How do you know if you're out of control?
How do you know?
You never will know

How do you know if you're out of control?
How do you know?
You never will know
How do you know if you're out of control?
What are we feeling right now?
