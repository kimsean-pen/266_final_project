It's kind of messed up
The only time I write
Is when I'm stressed or sad
And turn out the light
I'm afraid I messed up
And I'm not worth my blisters
Because birthdays and Christmas
Are not on my wish list

I like happy songs
With titles that don't match at all
So spin the bottle in your brain
And match your weakness with a name

You're so cold
I've got to know
What made you so
Scared to be alone?
I've got to know
Who chilled your bones
That wasn't me

When I feel brave
And gather my words
My speech I gripped
Starts to slip and slur
I don't want this black cloud anymore
I don't want this dead doubt anymore
Weighing me down
Stressing me out

I like happy songs
With titles that don't match at all
So spin the bottle in your brain
And match your weakness with a name
I like happy songs that sound nice
Even with their words like dog bites
Cutting through my hands
'Cause feeling is a rare thing for me
On my ceiling

You're so cold
I've got to know
What made you so
Scared to be alone?
I've got to know
Who chilled your bones
That wasn't me

I brought a knife to a gunfight
I brought my words to a fistfight
I brought my hell to you
And now the boys are back
The boys are sad

You're so cold
I've got to know
What made you so
Scared to be alone?
I've got to know
Who chilled your bones
That wasn't me
