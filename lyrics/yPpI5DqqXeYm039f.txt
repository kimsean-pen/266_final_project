There's a graveyard coming up
It's coming up quick
Drive right past it
Hold your breath
Clenching your fists
This is not the end of anything

There/s a girl next to me
She feels like rain
Crying her eyes out
All the time
Speak a little louder
I can help you out if you want

But you are not good for me
Yeah you are not good for me

I see a red rose wrestle
the weeds outside
I could pick it for you
but the forest denies
So wait your turn and you'll get
something else

I see a dog barking backwards
It gave me a fright
I could calm him down
but the owner is right
He's a danger to the town
and he'll pack up real soon and leave

But you are not good for me
Yeah you are not good for me

And I...
I saw the fear
in your eye

You are not good
Not good for me
Yeah you are not good
Not good for me
