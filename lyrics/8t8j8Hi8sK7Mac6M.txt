They say you've born to the eternal kidness
And that was conceived by divine grace
That cama to finish with the pervetion and evil
And died on the cross to humanity save

The pervetion and evil only start after you came
Because you was only a crazy lier
False saints were with you on your insanity
And the more stupids believed on you

Thieves and corrupts
Now eleited priests
They sellet pieces
Of cloth saying it were yours
The chief of insanity
Now is reigning at rome
The pervetio and evil
Only start after you came
