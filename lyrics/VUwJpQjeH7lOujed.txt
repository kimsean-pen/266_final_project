You're cruel, device
Your blood, like ice
One look, could kill
My pain, your thrill

I wanna love you but I better not touch
(Don't touch) I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much
(Too much) I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous

Poison
You're poison, running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains

Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace, on sweat

I hear you calling, and it's needles and pins
(And pins) I wanna hurt you
Just to hear you screaming my name
Don't wanna touch you but you're under my skin
(Deep in) I wanna kiss you, but your lips are venomous

Poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains

Poison

One look (One look)
Could kill (Could kill)
My pain, your thrill

I wanna love you but I better not touch
(Don't touch) I wanna hold you
But my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much
(Too much) I wanna taste you
But your lips are venomous

Poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains

Poison (Poison)

I wanna love you but I better not touch
(Don't touch) I wanna hold you
But my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much
(Too much) I wanna taste you
But your lips are venomous

Poison (Yeah, well)

I don't wanna break these chains
Poison (Poison)
Runnin' deep inside my veins
Burnin' deep inside my brain
Poison (Poison)
I don't wanna break these chains
(Poison) poison (Poison)
