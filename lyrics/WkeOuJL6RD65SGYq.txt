Torn heart, possessed mind
Drawn to the dark side
Pledge yourself to the demon kind

Swallowed by blind rage
Once pure, now bloodstained
Evil flows through your black veins

Unlimited sin, unlimited power
There's a price you must pay
Unlimited sin, unlimited power
That's the choice you have made
Unlimited sin

Reincarnation
Abomination
Fulfill your utmost desire
Flesh and blood!

Unlimited sin, unlimited power
Just a whisper away
Unlimited sin, unlimited power
One with pleasure and pain
Unlimited sin

Unlimited, unlimited
Unlimited, unlimited

Unlimited sin, unlimited power
There's a price you must pay
Unlimited sin, unlimited power
That's the choice you have made

Unlimited sin, unlimited power
Just a whisper away
Unlimited sin, unlimited power
One with pleasure and pain
Unlimited sin
