Hold out your hand
Let me feel you
As the sun comes up again
I've never felt
So free

We left the fight
We left the cold
And the darkness
Tried to take us down
I've never felt so free

We made it through the night Hold out your hand
Let me feel you
As the sun comes out again
I've never felt
So free

We left the fight
We left the cold
And the darkness
Tried to take us down
I've never felt so free

We made it through the night
