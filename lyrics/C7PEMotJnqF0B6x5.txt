I am hurry
And I forget my name
Every single day

I don't need you
And I found my way
Don't care what you say

I am hurry
And I forget my name
It's a little bit late for shame

I don't need you
And I don't feel no pain
There is nothing inside my vain

I will set you free
I will tell you go away
I'm with you mother
He's done and that's his way

I am running
And I'm going no way
There's a world full o fame... Be safe

I am hiding
To avoid endless days
Can't you have what he has these days?

I will set you free
I will tell you go away
I'm with you mother
He's done and that's his way
