I've grown used to the plane rides
Fresh linens on my king-size, baby
And sleepin' alone
If I didn't take a trick home
Start drinking in the morning
New city, same story
Always this club or that
Won't someone get me where my boys at?

Before you came along
I never really saw
How empty I'd become
If you'll just give me the chance
I'll leave it in the past
And you'll be my only one

We don't have to go out just 'cus it's Friday night
We can just stay here, do whatever you like
Ditch the car downstairs, nobody has to know
We'll turn the cell phones off, leave the radio on
And you'll dance real slow, baby, please don't stop
Just take my hand, this night don't have to end
If we don't let the light in
So just don't let the light in, oh

I'm only bein' honest
Because I really want this, baby
I'm comin' clean
You gotta know that that's hard for me

Before you came along
I never really saw
How empty I'd become
If you'll just give me the chance
I'm gonna be the man
The one you know I was

We don't have to go out just 'cus it's Friday night
We can just stay here, do whatever you like
Ditch the car downstairs, nobody has to know
We'll turn the cell phones off, leave the radio on
And you'll dance real slow, baby, please don't stop
Just take my hand, this night don't have to end
If we don't let the light in

And honestly
I think this whole you and me
Could be something that just works out
So just stay with me
I'm living for your energy
And you got me dreamin' out loud

We don't have to go out just 'cus it's Friday night
We can just stay here, do whatever you like
Ditch the car downstairs, nobody has to know
We'll turn the cell phones off, leave the radio on
And you'll dance real slow, baby, please don't stop
Just take my hand, this night don't have to end
If we don't let the light in

(Don't let the light in, light in, light in, oh, oh)
(Don't let the light in, light in, light in, oh, oh)

Don't let the light in
Don't let the light in
So don't let the light in
