Burnt lips when the wind blows
Black tint on the windows
I can't see what the future holds
But I wanna know

I tip toe on a dirt road
Too hot for the devil
I can't see what the future holds but I wanna know

It's like hearts don't bleed like mine
All we need is time

Summer is a curse and I can't let go
If you never try then you never know
A broke city with a broken heart
The summer is a curse and we fall apart

Dark days and a deeper cold
If you never try then you'll never know
A broke city with a broken heart
The summer is a curse and we fall apart

Sea breeze you convince me
Yeah I don't need this city
I could leave in a heartbeat
And you gotta know
Yeah you gotta know

Hearts don't bleed like mine
All we need is time

The summer is a curse and I can't let go
If you never try then you'll never know
A broke city with a broken heart
The summer is a curse and we fall apart

Dark days and a deeper cold
If you never try then you'll never know
A broke city with a broken heart
The summer is a curse and we fall apart

The summer is a curse and I can't let go
If you never try then you never know
A broke city with a broken heart
We fall apart

The summer is a curse and I can't let go
If you never try then you'll never know
A broke city with a broken heart
The summer is a curse and we fall apart

Dark days and a deeper cold
If you never try then you'll never know
A broke city with a broken heart
The summer is a curse and we fall apart

The summer is a curse and I can't let go
If you never try then you never know
A broke city with a broken heart
The summer is a curse and we fall apart
