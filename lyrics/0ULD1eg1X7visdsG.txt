Smash my heart in pieces
It looks so good on the floor

Days slip into years
Of wounds that bleed fresh
Suffer in silence
Is what you do best
You have no guidance
No person to tell
You're bleeding on the inside
But ain't here can tell
Your smile is a mask
You wear it so well
The darkness you carry has given you hell
I know it gets scary
But you will be fine
You won't have to deal with the voice in your mind

Look up kid
I see your face, you are going through something
Look up kid
It gets better but you won't even know it
Look up kid
I see your face, you are going through something
Look up kid

Don't forget the darkness
Always turns to light
You will have to fight for
The sanity you find
Go and find a corner
A place where you can pray
And hope to God you'll make it
With every second that you make

Tension is calling and I call your bluff
Tell me you're trying, you can't give up
Moments that count 'cause in the end
You'll say you made it, you'll say that you'll win

Look up kid
I see your face, you are going through something
Look up kid
It gets better but you won't even know it
Look up kid
I see your face, you are going through something
Look up kid

Don't hit the ground, don't turn around
I won't come back 'til you're safe and you're sound
Help you calm down, make you come 'round
I'll never leave you, I promise I'm down
If I'm out of town, if I'm out of bound
I will come get you sooner than now
I'm begging you now
I'm begging you now
(I'm begging, I'm begging, I'm begging you now)

Look up kid
I see your face, you are going through something
Look up kid
It gets better but you won't even know it
Look up kid
I see your face, you are going through something
Look up kid
