Yeah yeah
Come on

All these vibes, so blase blase blah
I need your high, come on, come on, come on
My throat is dry, come pour some more, some more
When we lock eyes, I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours

Ooh, your body got these moves, your body
Ooh, your body, high
Ooh your body, yeah, I know it wants me
Ooh, your body, is blowing my mind, 'cause

All this tension that we can't control
Got me catching feelings on my dance floor
Ooh, damn, I'm hoping that we take it home
Got me catching feelings on the dance floor

All this tension that we can't control (come on)
Got me catching feelings on my dance floor
Ooh, damn, I'm hoping that we take it home
Got me catching feelings on the dance floor

Ain't gonna lie, you got me open wide
The way you move is setting me on fire
My throat is soar, come pour some more, some more
You're all mine, yours, I'm yours, I'm yours

Ooh, your body got these moves, your body
Ooh, your body, high
Ooh your body, yeah, I know it wants me
Ooh, your body, is blowing my mind, 'cause

All this tension that we can't control
Got me catching feelings on my dance floor
Ooh, damn, I'm hoping that we take it home
Got me catching feelings on the dance floor

(Yeah)
So forget this distance, come and pull me tight
Can you feel this tension? We could go all night, ah ah
We could get it started, make it radiant
I'ma call you Sally when you make me sweat, ah ah

And you know like I know
I'm getting you alone, I'm getting you alone
And you know like I know
I'm 'bout to take you home, I'm 'bout to take you home

'Cause
All this tension that we can't control
Got me catching feelings on my dance floor
Ooh, damn, I'm hoping that we take it home
Got me catching feelings on the dance floor
All this tension that we can't control (come on)
Got me catching feelings on my dance floor
Ooh, damn, I'm hoping that we take it home
Got me catching feelings on the dance floor
