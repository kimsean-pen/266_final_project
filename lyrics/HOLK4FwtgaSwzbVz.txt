I was on the run
When I get your call
"Meet me at the park, bring your water guns"
So I'm going down
You played me The Cure
Friday I'm in love, it's so good it hurts

Nothing I can do about you
Nothing you can do about me
So let's get crazy
There's nothing I can do about you
There's nothing you can do about me
So let's get crazy
All our bitter days are done
Our living has just begun
So let's get crazy

Glass filled to the top
Hands filled with the ace
Our fighters heading north
There's nothing to erase
Bats under the bridge
Sunset take the flight
When does a body know to bow out of the fight

There's nothing I can do about you
There's nothing I can do about me
So let's get crazy
Nothing we can do with this calm
No way to escape the heat
So let's get shady
All our bitter days are done
Our living has just begun
Let's go crazy

Ship to shore, nobody's yours
We're out for more
All our friends are coming through the port tonight
On time
Buddy I'm your golden torch
You're my wild horse
Make up the story
We are gonna be alright

No way to escape the heat
Nothing we can do with this calm
So let's get crazy

Calm, no way to escape the heat

So let's get crazy
