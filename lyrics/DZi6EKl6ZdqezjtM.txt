Pushing, and pushing the tension grows
Caving into my worst impulse
Crossing the lines of the human threshold
It's grinding in my skull
Another button pushed digs a deeper hole
While you hold for your life
I'll be holding onto
Your neck, no breath
Accept slow death
True punishment

The fear in your eyes
The fire in mine
Two hands clenched
To cut the flow
Watch you as you leave this place for good
Darker and darker
The light dims
The panic fades
Breathe again
Two hands clenched
To cut the flow
Watch you as you leave this world for good
Darkest impulse plagues my mind
Pent up anger lit on fire
Darkest impulse plagues my mind
Pent up anger lit on fire

Take you to the edge
To the edge of life
I feel no remorse
See it in my eyes
