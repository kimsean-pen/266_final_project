Gettin up
C'mon we gettin up
ooh we gettin up
ah, yeah shorty work it
where you goin

Sent you a message, sent you a email
hasty decisions we made still prevail
both needed breaks, we both needed to bail

walkin through the corridors of my mind
the hideaways and jokes and things were good times
memories certainly, yes they still bind

still a common man, oh yeah that's for sure
still a bank roll, and yeah still couture
but man this thing we had was much more

come back home, don't be out in the world
it's a rat race and no place for a girl
amongst the scavengers I found a pretty pearl

it's for the faint of heart who never get enough
gotta get tough buckle 'em up we call 'em guts
and we, and we, and we, ahh

(We gotta)Gettin up, (we gotta) Gettin up
(today is nice, c'mon I say we) Gettin up
I say we gettin up, I say we gettin up
(I say we) Gettin up, (I say we) Gettin up
(tonight is right, c'mon we gon') Gettin up
I say we gettin up, I say we gettin up

Come over here baby, don't look so grumpy
this kind of lifestyle could be so comfy
we can start a clan just like the Kennedys

You and I again, certainly we can expand
feelings that should never end,
you respect me like a friend
but love me like your man
no other could contend

and we could be like those exposed to history
like staying with each other w/truth and chivalry
the things we go through they shape identity

yes pretty, let's do this all night
consummate this thing and make it all right
and when we cuddle up I promise that I'll bite

Chorus

I like to watch everybody gravitate towards you
your magneticism makes them all come through
the same way you got them, you got me too

now look our lives' are so colorful
a wonderful spectrum, not one tone dull
full of excitement and not one lull

we had an understanding, oh yes we did
I'm bringin it back, I'm puttin in my bid
have a couple of kids, and have a couple of cribs

We like Ruby Dee and Ossie, Martin and Coretta
doin it til death, no one can do it better
when we leave our physical,
our spirits still together

so c'mon now here's a placement for your hand
you're rockin with the #1 MC man
the #1 controller all right through the land

Chorus
