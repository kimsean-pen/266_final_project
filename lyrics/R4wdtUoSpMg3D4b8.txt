You have a right to remain silent
Anything you say or do
Will be held against you in a court of law
So don't be such a fool
No, don't be such a fool
Don't sand too close to me, darling
Keep your hands where I can see
Don't you know you're wanted in fifty states?
I love you, dear, but it's not up to me
And it's never been quite been, you see
You are a statue, you are like a mountain
You are alive with many visions in your eyes
I understand your reason for lying
I don't condemn you for being so wise
You've only crossed the line that I'm standing beside
You've never double back before
What lover is wet enough for you tonight
Is she another in and out of your door?
Was I another in and out of your door?
Don't stand too close to me, darling
Keep your hands where I can see
Don't you know you're wanted in fifty states
I love, dear, but it's not up to me
And it's never quite been, you see
And some of the things that you've said in my ear
As you open a door and casually smile
How I have wanted to scream
Of the things
Of the things that enter my mind
My friend, it's hard to see you
It's easier to leave you alone
There was a time when I needed you more
My friend, it's hard to see you
It's easier to leave you alone
There was a time when I needed you more
