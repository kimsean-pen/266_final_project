This time you got it all figured it out
Think it's gonna work okay
But I'll make sure it won't
'Cause I'll be standing in your way

So wait a minute if you will
I ain't got no time but time to kill
When the ground starts getting hot
It doesn't matter if you run or not

This time you've seen it done before
This time you're gonna get it right
Once more you fail miserably and then
Then you do it all over again

So wait a minute if you will
I ain't got no time but time to kill
When the ground starts getting hot
It doesn't matter if you run or not

Once a failure and twice a fool
I will
(Knock, knock)
If you won't
(Knock, knock)
You're damned
(Knock, knock)
If you don't
(Knock, knock)
You did fine
(Knock, knock)
Now you're mine
(Knock, knock)
You avoided everything except from me
I'm bustin' in
Won't pick the lock
I'm bustin' in knock, knock

I've seen your sort before
You are nothing new
'Cause my name is failure
And failure is gonna come to you

Save me, Lord and I will out
This time I got the time to kill
When the ground starts getting hot
It doesn't matter if you run or not

Once a failure and twice a fool
I will
(Knock, knock)
If you won't
(Knock, knock)
You're damned
(Knock, knock)
If you don't
(Knock, knock)
You did fine
(Knock, knock)
Now you're mine
(Knock, knock)
You avoided everything except for me
I'm bustin' in, won't pick the lock
I'm bustin' in, knock, knock

Knock, knock
I'm bustin' in knock, knock
Knock, knock
I'm bustin' in knock, knock
