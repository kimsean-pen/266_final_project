Fuck This!
What do you want from me?
Run your monopoly
I am the opposite
God forbid
I could be, living antithesis
Revel in this resist,
Maybe you get the gist venomous
Standing in line is the way that you go!
I will survive on the path that I chose!
Sever the ties from the blind and all those!
Ignorant bastards I am in control

You won't take me alive
I'd rather die, than live in this prison
I am Anti-Everything
Done being kind, I draw the line
No I will not give in
I am Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything

Slit wrists, cover the world with it
I am a pessimist,
I am obsessed with it, blessed with it
Leave a mark
Show me your battle scar
Ripping the rules apart
I am a war!
Give me a stone,
And I'll cast the first blow
Cover me up on the truth that I know
Doing it now when you said that i won't
Hungry and harder and all on my own

You won't take me alive
I'd rather die, than live in this prison
I am Anti-Everything
Done being kind, I draw the line
No I will not give in
I am Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything

You'll never get the best of me
I'm Anti-Everything
You'll never get the best of me
I'm Anti-Everything

Yeah!

Come on!

Oh!

Yeah!

You won't take me alive
I'd rather die, than live in this prison
I am Anti-Everything
Done being kind, I draw the line
No I will not give in,
I am Anti-Everything

You won't take me alive,
I'd rather die, than live in this prison
I am Anti-Everything
Done being kind, I draw the line
No I will not give in
I am Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything
Anti-Everything
