I'm a Flyer of my universe
Oh yeah it's open having no end
On my way to the end of life
Resting my wings for a time
I'm so pleased with my life as it was
'Cause I did my best
'Cause I did my best
'Cause I did my best

Blowing I don't know where it's from
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I just feel a fresh smell
And the sound of the next life is
Coming up to my ears
In the sky, I fly up and down and I see
Rainbow far away
Rainbow far away
See the rainbow far away
