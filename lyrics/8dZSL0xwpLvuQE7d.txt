I'll take your words
As if you were talking to me
So say what I know you'll say
And say it through your teeth

Now in the deep and down
Your heart moves
Now in the deep and down
I don't know how but I know I want out
Wait for something better
Will I know when it can be us?

Wait for something better
Maybe that doesn't mean us
Wait for something better
I shouldn't, it's not enough
Pull one excuse from another

And with pride
Keep every failure in
And with pride
Hold on to your thinking

Now in the deep and down
Your heart moves
Now in the deep and down
I don't know how but I know I want out
Wait for something better
Will I know when it can be us?
Wait for something better
Maybe that doesn't mean us

Wait for something better
I shouldn't, it's not enough
Pull one excuse from another
This time it means stop, stop

Pull one excuse from another
This time it means stop

Wait for something better
Will I know when it can be us?
Wait for something better
Maybe that doesn't mean us
Wait for something better
I shouldn't, it's not enough

Pull one excuse from another
This time it means stop
