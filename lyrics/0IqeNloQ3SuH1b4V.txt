I'm a first timer, wishing i was someone else
When i see you by yourself
In a corridor where you find yourself now blocked
By a door you locked

You won't do what the doctor ordered
You won't see someone else
Come on back to me, my bright tomorrow
You say feel hollow and you know it's cause you are
Well at least so far

I think of you with hesitation
I think of you too hard
Come on back to me
But don't make me sorry

I'm a first timer, wishing i'd been someone else
Seeing you by yourself
Seeing you by yourself
