High on diesel and gasoline, psycho for drum machine
Shaking their bits to the hits
Drag acts, drug acts, suicides, in your dad's suits you hide

Staining his name again
Cracked up, stacked up, 22, psycho for sex and glue
Lost it to Bostik, yeah.

Shaved heads, rave heads, on the pill, got too much time too kill
Get into bands and gangs.
Oh, here they come, the beautiful ones, the beautiful ones

La la la la la
Here they come, the beautiful ones, the beautiful ones
La la la la la

Loved up, Doved up, hung around, stoned in a lonely town
Shaking their meat to the beat
High on diesel and gasoline, psycho for drum machine

Shaking their bits to the hits
Oh, here they come, the beautiful ones, the beautiful ones.
La la la la la

Here they come, the beautiful ones, the beautiful ones
La la la la la
You don't think about it

You don't do without it
Because you're beautiful
And if your baby's going crazy

That's how you made me
La, la, la, la...
And if your baby's going crazy
That's how you made me
And if your baby's going crazy
That's how you made me
La, la, la, la...
La, la, la, la la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la la, la
La, la la la la la...
