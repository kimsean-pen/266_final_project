Walk through this garden
Of unearthly delights
Star of the goddess
Demoniac inside

Soon you'll discover
What it means to reel in light
When all things are considered
There's not much to leave behind

Come ye to the Sabbat
Hecate drawn from lunar womb
Our witch cult unties you
As you're drawing down the moon

We welcome you to the Sabbat
With a knowledge of hellfire
And those who've gathered here among us
Know of this and so very many things besides
