When I'm lying in your bed
Play the motions through my head
You know that I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
And I have reasons to believe
That I'm not the only one you spend this time with

But I'll stay...
You say
You're weak
You won't let me down

You won't let me down.
You lied
Through your teeth
You smiled in your sleep
You smile in your sleep.

When we met
You said that we were the same
You know that we're different
We're different

And all those time you promised me that
Everything would work out in the end.
You were gravely mistaken.

You say
You're weak
You won't let me down
You won't let me down.

You lied
Through your teeth.
You smiled in your sleep

You smile in your sleep.
You lied
You lied
You lied
You lied.
You lied
Through your teeth
You won't let me down
You lied
I deserve better then this
I dream of steel
Maroon and warm
Your end (Your end)
Your end (Your end)
You gasp for air
I'll see this through
I'll see through you
You're pale (You're pale)
You're pale (You're pale)
You're pale
Blue eyes.
When your lying in your bed
Your eulogy's been read
You know that it's fitting.
You lied.
You say
Your weak
You wont let me down
You wont let me down
You lied
Through your teeth
You smiled in your sleep
You smile in your sleep
You smile.
You smile.
You smile.
You smile
I deserve better than this.
