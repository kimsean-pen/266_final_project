Tell me baby, tell me where did you sleep last night
I heard noises in the cupboard were you trying to hide
'Cause you should know how much I hate this
If you were I'll hit your hiding place until sunrise

[Incomprehensible]
I'm falling in love
[Incomprehensible]
I'm falling in love
'Cause I need your loving
Everyday and every night
[Incomprehensible]
I'm falling in love

Tell me baby where did you sleep last night
I heard noises in the cupboard were you trying to hide
'Cause you should know how much I hate this
If you were I'll hit your hiding place until sunrise

[Incomprehensible]
I'm falling in love
[Incomprehensible]
I'm falling in love
'Cause I need your loving
Everyday and every night
[Incomprehensible]
I'm falling in love
