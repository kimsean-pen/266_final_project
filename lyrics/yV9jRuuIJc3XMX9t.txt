The wild things will chase you down
They'll steal your throne and break your crown
Don't ever look them in the eyes
You'll only find a nest of lies

You've got the hatred that you
You've always hated in you
You've got to face them now

Try to stay away
From where the wild things play
(La la la la la)
[x2]

If you waltz with the wild things
They'll break your nose and steal all your things
And it gets worse, late at night
After the long day, when you can't fight

You've got the hatred that you
You've always hated in you
You've got to face them now

Try to stay away
From where the wild things play
(La la la la la)
[x2]

The wild things will chase you down
They'll steal your throne and break your crown
And never look them in the eyes
You'll only find a nest of lies

Try to stay away
From where the wild things play
(La la la la la)
[x4]

You've got the hatred that you
You've always hated in you
You've got to face them now
