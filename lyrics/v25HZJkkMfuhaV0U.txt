It's time I should be leaving, it's time for me to go
A painting on my ceiling and your footprints in the snow
They found you Christmas morning beneath the tree in the front yard
The sound, the screams, the mourning
As we send sympathy cards

Hydrocodone acid-washed brain
A shame, a total loss
They said that they did all they could
That boy's been dead since childhood
Leave me alone to analyze
The sour power of surprise
A ticker out of time and whack
Too young to die of heart attacks

I guess I should be going
There's nothing I can say
To keep your dad from throwing up at least 3 times a day
They found you Christmas morning beneath the tree in the front yard
The pounding of your mother's fist while freezing in the car

Oxycodone acid-washed brain
A shame, a total loss
They said that they did all they could
That boy's been dead since childhood
Leave me alone to analyze
The sour power of surprise
A ticker out of time and whack
Too young to die of heart attacks

I'd kill for a drink
(Fetch me a drink)
Casket to carry
Try not to think
(Try not to think)
About you dead and buried

Hide your gun on acid washed
Brain a shame, a total loss
They said that they did all they could
That boys been dead since childhood
Leave me alone to analyze
Saw our power after pride
Ticker out of time and whack
To be young and die of heart attack
