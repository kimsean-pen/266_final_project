Who's that girl
From the shisha spot
Body like Woah made my heart won't stop
Is what they say cause you look so hot
And I picked you girl cause of what you got
Like every time you apply lip gloss
Have to come here and take it all off
2 glass of wine & off comes the watch
When I get you home it's a whine & kotch
Dress cool cool but you're hot like coals
Yeah tryna bubble & vibe real low
Yeah, girl, you're a baddy and the whole place knows
Let me lock you down before I leave touch road
I turn Superman when I'm around you
No Snoop Dogg
You are my crib tonight
You can get pipe like a shisha table
My girl, you can get whoo tonight

Meet her at a shisha spot
Golden locks & a laker top
Pretty face, eyes and a smile to match
Didn't want to rush or got to fast
So I had to stop
And play it cool
Didn't want to come on strong
Or be the fool
So I sat back & just kicked it
Steady flow
Conversation for a couple minutes
I smiled
She laughed
Minutes turned to hours as the rolled past
A traveller dancer type
She took my heart & gave it life for a night
Didn't know it then but the timing was right
The clock struck twelve
But she left me in the night
Now I'm sat here with just her name
(her name)
Never to know if she feels the same
But guess what?
Got a message Mrs M saying we should meet again & I'm like

Let me tell you suttin, baby girl you frontin
A girl who talks about it but you never really done it
You're lost in the moment from the moment that you spun it
A spider's web for men just come & get stuck in
We are just friends and friends just stay friendly
A flirtatious mind but girl don't tempt me
Cause I'm a man at the end of the day
So let's just keep it cool cause rules I like to break
I ain't breaking any of you keeping it on
Last chance for you to dance & get up in my arms
Our arms are linked but not tied at the heart
It's hard cause your heart just wants to be charmed
Charms are dark parts until they get a sparked
Girl, you're in the dark
Please don't be daft
I just need that dance that I wanted from the start
And I really want to start to get to know you from this mark
(oh my)
