Do you wanna Tell me, What You have against me.
And why, You keep me in disguise.
What are you afraid of, 'Cause it can't be that bad.
Being friends, Than official times.
For a couple of days I've gotten looks from your lady.
Now you tell me how she knows I've got your eyes on You.
And it's funny how your girl just seems to ignore me.
Anytime we're stuck together in the same small room.
Baby, doesn't have to be You and her.
Maybe we can make it work.
Maybe we can make it work.
And Baby, Don't You know I wanna rock Your world.
And I don't care about the other girl.
You know I've never been scared of her.
We can make it work.
She's a bit of a looker.
But you could do better.
You're worth it.
I can make You see she doesn't care.
The way I care.
Don't You know.
You're better off with me.
But if we can't be real and you really do feel that baby she's the one.
I can let it go we can keep it down low.
And if she asks it was just good fun.
Boy you say it's not the way you think it should go.
And you miss me far too much.
Well, Make up your mind, 'Cause you're wasting my time, but I'm still not giving up.
Baby, doesn't have to be You and her.
Maybe we can make it work.
Maybe we can make it work.
And Baby, Don't You know I wanna rock Your world.
And I don't care about the other girl.
You know I've never been scared of her.
We can make it work.
It's too bad.
'Cause I don't know now.
The way I feel about You.
And then You do what You do.
Baby, doesn't have to be You and her.
Maybe we can make it work.
Maybe we can make it work.
And Baby, Don't You know I wanna rock Your world.
And I don't care about the other girl.
You know I've never been scared of her.
Baby... doesn't have to be You and her.
Maybe we can make it work.
Maybe we can make it work.
Maybe we can make it work.
No No No No.
And Baby, Don't You know I wanna rock Your world.
And I don't care about the other girl.
You know I've never been scared of her.
We can make it work.
