Remember when you walked out into the rain
The railroad and the sky were calling your name
Can you hear them whisper
Come and get lost with us
You've been chasing shadows in your hometown
You searched for answers that refused ever to be found
So you compromised and found a new horizon
Ever since you left you're always on my mind

So here's to you if you care to listen
Here's to you, let me cross the distance

Even if you're not here
I'll reach you, I'll reach you
Even though you're away, I'm near
We'll forgive and forget
I'll reach you

Seven years and seven days you've been gone
Seven years of changing faith and opinion
Would you recognize me
If you walked beside me?
I would keep on waiting
It's been to long

Here's to you if you care to listen
Here's to you, let me cross the distance

Even if you're not here
I'll reach you, I'll reach you
Even though you're away, I'm near
We'll forgive and forget
I'll reach you

Even if you're not here
I'll reach you, I'll reach you
Even though you're away, I'm near
We'll forgive and forget
I'll reach you

I'll reach you
