Spring came in one day
The clouds in front of the moon
Tore themselves to shreds
So that two moons passed in one night

Winter went and spring came
And the clouds tore off their clothes
Washed them in the rivers of rain
And naked in the dark they stayed
Waited for their cloaks to dry

They darkened the face of the moon
They would have tried to kill it
If they could have reached that far
As it spied on the clouds

Winter went and spring came
And the clouds tore off their clothes
Washed them in the rivers of rain
And naked in the dark they stayed
Waited for their cloaks to dry

They've taken off in the rivers of heaven
They've taken off
They've taken off
