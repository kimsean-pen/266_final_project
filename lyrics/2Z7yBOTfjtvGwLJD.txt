While I'm waiting
The rotting process consumes my life
Excruciating suffering
That none can identify

Agonizing game
Drugs can't numb the pain
Death would be for me
A peaceful recovery

Severe amputations
To stop the infection
Morbid auscultation
Livid coloration of my skin
Self deterioration
Organic corruption
Innards explorations
Gives no explanation of my disease

Doctors agree
No recovery
In the morgue, I'll be
left to rest in pieces

While I'm lying
My coffins cover is closed to eyes
My mangled restful body
No one could identify
