Impetuous girl, what you don't know can't hurt you
Wish they wouldn't come back around here no more
But you say "I'll get you yet"

They are crass, all the people in towns,
Are falling out and falling down and falling
Wish I would've come back here less
As a boy dressed up as girl dressed all in colors

And how you will sing to them, and how your pain will fall
And how you will sing to them,

Singing it: "La la la la la la la la la lah "
You don't have to cry anymore
You don't have to cry anymore

All the prettiest worlds, don't cover them all up in your mind
As you paint, as it should've been, you were meant to love
You could not live without it
And in your heart and in your lines

And you've worked so hard and you've lived so kind,
Been out there just falling down
Wish they wouldn't come back
For my boy dressed as a girl dressed all in colors

And how you will sing to them and how your verses fall
And how there's a Roman candle burning just for you

You don't have to cry anymore
You don't have to cry anymore
You don't have to cry anymore
You don't have to cry anymore
