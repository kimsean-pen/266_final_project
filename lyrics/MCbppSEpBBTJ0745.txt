Realize you're
Dehumanized you
Criticize your existence
It's your demise when no sun arise when you're
Paralyzed by your lack of resistance

She don't know who she is
She don't know where she's going
Down below where the fire's glowing
Tenderloin, Tenderloin, Tenderloin

She don't know who she is
She don't know where she's going
Down below where the fire's glowing
Tenderloin, Tenderloin, Tenderloin

The tricks she gets them
She's not a victim
She makes a list of them and reads them all alone
For money she's walking down on Larkin
In T.I. they're rocking all night long

She don't know who she is
She don't know where she's going
Down below where the fire's glowing
Tenderloin, Tenderloin, Tenderloin

She don't know who she is
She don't know where she's going
Down below where the fire's glowing
Tenderloin, Tenderloin, Tenderloin
