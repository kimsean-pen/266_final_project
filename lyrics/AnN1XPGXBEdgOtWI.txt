We don't come down, we just stay up all year
Counting our vices dear
And shit that got us here

When I looked, didn't have to be a language
No written rules or commitments
It was enough to be alive

One by one, two by two Ms. Jenny Jenkins
You know I wouldn't change things
Even if I made it

So we take our time and skip around some
Half my love is on the run
Half my love is on the run
Chase it down while I'm young

La da da da...

My car broke down somewhere up on the long drive
We watched the lights break
On the imported palms
And we laughed out loud
And all of the bullshit here
I'm dying on promises dear
In the Hollywood sun

One by one, two by two Ms. Jenny Jenkins
You know I wouldn't change things
Even if I made it

So we take our time and skip around some
Half my love is on the run
Half my love is on the run
Chase it down while I'm young

La da da...

One by one, two by two Ms. Jenny Jenkins
You know I wouldn't change things
Even if I made it
