You come into the world alone
And you go out of the world alone
But in between, theres you and me
Ohhh

Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh

The summer breezes blow so tall
And the winter nights are cold and so long
In between the falling leaves ohhh

Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh
OhohohOh

The days and nights are killing me
The light and dark are still in me
But there's and anchor on the beach
So let the wind blow hard
And bring a falling star Ohoh

Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh
OhohohOH

Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh
