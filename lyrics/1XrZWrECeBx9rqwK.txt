Listen, and I'll try to make you see
Listen, I'm tired now
It's timeless, and it's growing every day
And frameless, in every way

Free again, bleed my truth in timeless sand
Free again, I'll believe and understand
Your world, be your world
Bleed again, I am nothing in your eyes
Bleed again, to regain myself and feel
Your world

Embrace the nothingness and...

In my cold dark emptiness, I will save you
Or repay in recklessness, in the nothingness
To my deep and dark demand, I'll betray you
And destroy your hopefulness

Innerlines, leading me astray
Inner lies, taking me away
It's pointless, shrinking day by day
Eventless, in every way

Free again, bleed my truth in timeless sand
Free again, I'll believe and understand
Your world, be your world
Bleed again, I am nothing in your eyes
Bleed again, to regain myself and feel
Your world, save your world

In my cold dark emptiness, I will save you
Or repay in recklessness, in the nothingness
To my deep and dark demand, I'll betray you
And destroy in hopefulness

Free again, bleed my truth in timeless sand
Free again, I'll believe and understand
Your world, be your world
Bleed again, I am nothing in your eyes
Bleed again, to regain myself and feel
Your world, save your world
