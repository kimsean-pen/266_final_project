Been watching myself in the mirror,
for 40 plus some years.
And seeing how time,
makes you wrinkled and gray.

Remember when we were young,
we had all the time in the world.
And life was beautiful,
we didn't had a clue.

As we're getting older,
more lies are shining through.
And I'm busting my heart for the world.
I'm getting tired, I just wanna go home.

I'm coming home!

My head is empty and I need a break.
I have to be hungry again to breathe and create.
Life don't come easy, it's always the same.
My brain is a ticking bomb!

I'm getting tired,
I just wanna go home.

I'm coming home!
I'm coming home!
I'm coming home!

Life's not a dream,
nothing is what it seems to be.

My brain is a ticking bomb!
I'm getting tired,
I just wanna go home.

I'm coming home...
