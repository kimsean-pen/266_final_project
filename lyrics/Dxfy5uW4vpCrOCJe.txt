I went back home
I saw the people that I used to know
oooooo
I'm on my own
Just like the others out there
Guess I feel alone
oooooo
You're so perfect holding down it
It's so easy
But don't you see I'm trying to let it all be
I said I didn't want it
Now there's nothing for me
I went back home
I saw the people that I used to know
oooooo
I'm on my own
Judt like the others out there
Guess I feel alone
oooooo
They say sister come down easy
Show me the feel
