I gotta get my, my mind enlightened
And I, I gotta set my, my soul on fire
But I am so down right now
I am so down right now

Yeah
Yeah

I gotta get my, my heart back open
Gotta let someone new inside
But it's still broken
Man I am so down right now
I am so down right now

And I believe, I believe in the pain
Yeah I believe it's the way to find peace again
Trying, yeah, trying
So down, so down right now

I gotta turn my, my song on louder
Gotta sing it like I, like I am proud to be alive
But I'm so down right now
I am so down right now

And I believe, I believe in the pain man
Yeah I believe it's the way to find love again

Yeah, I'm trying
Yeah, I'm trying
Yeah I'm trying
Yeah

So down, so down, so down
Yeah I believe it's the way to find me again

Yeah, I'm trying
Yeah, I'm trying
Yeah, I'm trying
Yeah, I'm trying
Yeah I'm trying (so down)
Yeah, I'm trying (so down)
I'm trying (so down)
I'm trying
