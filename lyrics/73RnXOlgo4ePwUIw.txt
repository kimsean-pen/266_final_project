I have never cried in anybody's arms
The way that I have often cried in yours
Please be the one to take my tears away
I was 22, I've had my share of views
I just can't steal that "happiness" from you
But I'll be the one to take your tears away

I can't believe the things you say
tell me, tell me
tell me the lies

I can't believe the things you say
tell me, tell me
tell me the lies
Fasting love will lead us all to nowhere

When, when will we learn
I shall avenge the death of all the romance
Until, until I'm gone
I can't believe the things you say
tell me, tell me
tell me the lies
I can't believe the things you say
tell me, tell me
tell me the lies
tell me you're lies
tell me you're lies
tell me the lies
tell me the lies
tell me, tell me the lies
