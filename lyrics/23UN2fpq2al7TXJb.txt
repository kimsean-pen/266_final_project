It starts in the theater, a night of encounters
If I hadn't been there, if not for a cigarette

And you could see it change
Look past the blinding light, look past the blinding light
But just keep talking on
Tell me your favorite things, tell me your favorite things

Difference in opinion was never an issue
Collect all your questions 'cause this time we've all night

And you could see it change
Look past the blinding light, look past the blinding light
But just keep talking on, on, oh oh oh
Tell me your favorite things, tell me your favorite things

Ooohh

And you could see it change
Look past the blinding light, look past the blinding light
But just keep talking on
Tell me your favorite things, tell me your favorite things
