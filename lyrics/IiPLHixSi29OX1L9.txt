Just drive

Tonight is the night, let's get ready to go
Leave your bags behind and let's hit the road
Tonight is the night, there's no time to lose, let's get going
Tonight is the night, let's follow the moon
You can take the wheel and I'll breathe the wind
With my head back and hands in the air I am flying
Just drive

Take me away tonight (just drive)
Just me with you tonight
Down the winding road, we will not let go
We will drive, no matter how far
Yes, we will drive until the ending of it all

So, here we are we left the world behind
You've got your foot on the gas and it's do or die
And these wheels are all we need as were cruising
So here we are in this Cadillac
We've got the rag top down and the seats are back
You turn to me and say: "baby we're flying"
Just drive

Take me away tonight (just drive)
Just me with you tonight
Down the winding road, we will not let go
We will drive, no matter how far
Yes, we will drive until the ending of it all

Until the ending of it all
We will drive, we will not look back

Just drive
Just drive

Down the winding road, we will not let go
We will drive, no matter how far
Yes, we will drive until the ending of it all
We will drive, no matter how far
Yes, we will drive until the ending of it all
