Darlin' darlin' darlin'
I can't wait to see you
Your picture ain't enough
I can't wait to touch you in the flesh

Darlin' darlin' darlin'
I can't wait to hear you
Remembering your love
Is nothing without you in the flesh

Went walking one day
On the Lower East Side
Met you with a girlfriend
You were so divine

She said, "Hands off this one sweetie
This boy is mine"
I couldn't resist you
I'm not deaf, dumb and blind

Darlin' darlin' darlin'
Now you're outta town
Those girls that you run with
They bring my head down

Ooh darlin' darlin'
Watch out if I see you
'Cause if you say hello
It'll mean you wanna see me in the flesh

Ooh, warm and soft
In the flesh
Ooh, close and hot
In the flesh
Ooh
