Upwards I climbed,
Above me stretched the northern skies,
Beneath the great night's height, I fought alone.
I was at war,
Both with myself and with it all,
My own shadow now my home,
No place to call my own.

Storms may come, but wild tempests won't tear me away from your arms.
I'll hold to the good and the true, I'll weather your storms for the stillness in you.

That night I ran, ran, ran before the storm

All of this time,
You said I gave too little, but I say you asked for too much!
Love's a two edged sword, and though I'm yours I'm mine!
And you'd see if you dared, that our moments were never owned,
Only ever were they shared!
For you there must be me, and for me there must be you!

But ancient love, I ran before the storm, no power to take me for I was ever yours

Storms may come, but wild tempests won't tear me away from your arms.
I'll hold to the good and the true, I'll weather your storms for the stillness in you.

That night I ran, ran, ran before the storm
That night I ran, ran, ran before the storm
That night I ran, ran, ran before the storm
