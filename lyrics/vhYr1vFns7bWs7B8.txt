I can see the storms in her eyes now
I'm falling overboard in the waves
In over my head and she's a high tide
That keeps pushing me away
I thought that we would build this together
But everything I touch just seems to break
Am I your sail or your anchor?
Am I the calm or the hurricane?

I feel the ground start to shake
I hear a voice shouting "No"
But there is no fucking way
I'd leave you

So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now,
Like a house on fire we're wrapped in flames
I'd burn you if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you,

But is the soundtrack to our lives
Is the pain of a slamming door
What happens when we all start to feel like
Nothing matters anymore
Every day like a chambered round, a trigger pulled
A hammer click, a breath we hold
A world outside I can't control
No matter what I do

So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now,
Like a house on fire we're wrapped in flames
I'd burn you if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you,

How is it a thing
That we just wanna hurt each other
I'm waiting on for rain
Cause life is gonna rain forever
Someday you will learn
That all I ever did was for you
And I would do it all again
I would do it all again

Till then I'll hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now,
Like a house on fire we're wrapped in flames
I'd burn you if that's what it takes
To let you know I can't let go of you,
Of you,
Of you,
Of you,
Of you
