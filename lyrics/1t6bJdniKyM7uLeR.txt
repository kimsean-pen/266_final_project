You play these games, baby honestly?
It's such a shame, you think you control me
Control my life, and everything around
I've got my feet on solid ground

I'm gonna push you away
With every word that you say
I'm gonna push you away, away...

I've let you win too many times
If I gave you my life, it'd be my demise
I'll keep my pride

This is what I have become in my life
I won't be deterred by your guilt or your strife
These are the words back and forth in my mind
I won't be brought down by your games and your pride

Sinking apologies, yeah yeah knowing you're leaving me on my own
Sinking apologies, yeah yeah knowing you're leaving me, all alone

You won't bring me down
I've got my feet on solid ground
You won't bring me down
I've got my feet on solid ground

You said you'd stay, then left me alone
I can't believe you're fine with what you've done
Never again, I've watched you change with time
You're heart is filled with cold, your mouth is full of lies
If I gave you my life it'd be my demise
I'll keep my pride, I've let you win too many times
Sinking apologies, knowing you're leaving me on my own
Sinking apologies, knowing you're leaving me all alone
