I want you
Just the way you are
I want you
Just the way you are

Just come on back to bed
Stay with me
Oh no, you know it's true

I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you

I'll buy you rings
And shiny diamond things
Don't want nothing from you, girl
Your love is all I need

Come on and dance
A little closer now
Come on and move
A little slower now

Just take a chance
I ain't gonna hurt you, child
I want you

Just come back to bed
Stay with me
Oh no, you know it's true

I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you

Stay here in bed
We'll work it out
Stay here for a little while

Just come back to bed
Stay with me
Oh no, you know it's true

I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
