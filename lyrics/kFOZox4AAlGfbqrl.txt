Into the Disco Scene,
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
Life began for me,
When a single DJ dropped the needle on my vinyl
(Everybody Dance)
I look out to see
People on the dancefloor, living proof of our revival.

Everynight night was a blast
We were flying fast, flying free, we were driven
No I dont (want to live in the past
but it is a nice place to visit)
And if you come along,
I'll be there
If you come along
I'll be there
and if you come along
I'll be there
and if you come along
I'll be there
if you come along

Equal days and nights
all around the world
there was an explosion (the clock keeps turning)
I was more alive (it's getting late)
cause we worship music and it symbolised emotion

Smash after smash after smash
I appreciate all the gifts I was given
Now I dont want to live in the past
but its a nice place to visit
So if you come along
I'll be there
If you come along
I'll be there
and if you come along
I'll be there
and if you come along
I'll be there
if you come along

(Do Doo Do Do Do etc)

I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
And if you come along
I'll be there
If you come along
I'll be there
and if you come along
I'll be there
and if you come along
I'll be there
if you come along
I'll be there
If you come along
I'll be there
and if you come along
I'll be there
no place like home
I'll be there
so if you come along
I'll be there.

I'll breath there
I'll be there
I'll breath there.

Lets get through it we almost did it.
