Got this infestation in my mind
Miscommunication with the boys
All these expectations, i need motivation
I'm not well and I need peace of mind, peace of mind
It's alright with peace of mind, mind, mind, mind
Let's pretend and slip into disguise
I'm the pray and you're the crocodile
Got your invitation, don't think i can make it
I'm too busy needing peace of mind, peace of mind
It's alright with peace of mind, mind, mind mind
Need and explanation
For this limitation
Why the hesitation?
It looks good on paper
Im alright when ive got peace of mind, peace of mind
It's alright with peace of mind, mind, mind, mind
