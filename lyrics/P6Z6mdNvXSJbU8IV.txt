Please sing to me,
I can see you open up to breathe.
Fast words make it easier on me,
Make a point to never disappoint you,
Somebody's got to tell me what to do.
Just wish you would've seen me
When it used to come so easy.
I like to say it's easy to stay
But it's not for me,
'Cause I'm barely here at all.

Slow down now, the secrets out.
And I swear now everything is perfect.
What you want, what you need has been killing me.
Tryna be everything that you want me to be.
I say yes, I'll undress, I'll do more for less.
Now I'll change everything until it's perfect again.

Coming down, coming around,
Giving a frown to the sound when I hit ground.
I hate the way that I say I should say
When I know that I don't give a fuck about it anyway.
Shake hands, and shoot smiles all around,
As I sell my body by the pounds.
Sign my name on the dotted line,
It would be fate, to not recessitate.

Slow down now, the secrets out.
And I swear now I'll still make this perfect.
What you want, what you need has been killing me.
Tryna be everything that you want me to be.
I say yes, I'll undress, I'll do more for less.
Now I'll change everything till it's perfect again.

I think it's better this way,
This is good in a better way.
It's better this way.
I'll make this perfect again.
I'll make this perfect again.

What you want, what you need has been killing me.
And I will change everything you want me to be.
I say yes, I'll undress, I'll do more for less.
Now I'll change everything, woah yeah.
What you want, what you need has been killing me.
Tryna be everything that you want me to be.
I say yes, I'll undress, I'll do more for less.
Now I'll change everything, I'll make this perfect again.
