Boxed up
All of her favorite things
Sold the rest at a rainy yard sale
Big plans and leaving friends and a westbound sign

Weighed out
Her choices on a scale
Prevailing nothing made sense
Just transportation and a blank decision

She's taking off
Taking off...
Taking off...
Taking off...

No time and no copping out
She's burning daylight and petrol
Blacked out the rearview mirror
Heading westward on strung out

On confusion road
And ten minute nervous breakdowns
Xanex a beer for thought and she determined

She's taking off
Taking off...
Taking off...
Taking off...

Is it salvation or an escape from discontent?
Will she find her name
In the California cement?
Punched out of the grind
That punched her one too many times...
Is tragedy 2000 miles away?
She's taking off
