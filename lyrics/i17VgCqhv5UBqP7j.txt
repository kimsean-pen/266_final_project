Rollin' and a rockin' on a late night
trying to beat the devil at a fist fight
looking for a friend in a bottle of red
making up a word thats never been said

Waiting in line for the next fine
making up a rhyme but it don't rhyme
baby, I'm a loser at this game
if you could see me now you'd be ashamed, be ashamed of me

Cause I'm not worthy of your love
im barely keeping up
feels like every single day, all I ever do is say I'm sorry
I guess that i'm not worthy of your love

Every night living like a runaway
trying to make it back for the break of day
I never learn from my mistakes
so much for my great escape

Put my future on the back burner
grew up fast but i'ma slow learner
only got myself to blame
if you could see me now you'd be ashamed of me, so ashamed of me

Cause I'm not worthy of your love
im barely keeping up
feels like every single day, all I ever do is sayIi'm sorry
i guess that i'm not worthy of your love

How could you possibly love someone like me?
a fool I'll always be

And I'm not worthy of your love
im barely keeping up
feels like every single day, all I ever do is say I'm sorry
I guess that i'm not worthy of your love
