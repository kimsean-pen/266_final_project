I fell asleep last night
But I woke up too late
And everything I loved
I began to hate

I know I sound repetitive
Cause I'm repeating myself
And I'm competitive
I want you all by yourself
And that alone is just the problem
I've got these woes
I just can't solve them

If I could gather up the nerve
I'd put my feelings into words
And if I weren't so young, or stupid, or restless
I might be able to just soon forget this
Just forget this

Please just forget me
When I'm out all alone on the east coast
And please don't forgive me
When you're home all alone and you need me most
Oh, when you need me most
Yeah, when you need me most

Oh if I only had the heart
To find out exactly who you are
You know I'd try now
But it's just fine
No you can't save me
It's no fault but mine
Please just blame me

If I could gather up the nerve
I'd put my feelings into words
And if I weren't so young, or stupid, or restless
I might be able to just soon forget this
Just forget this
Just forget this
Just forget this

Please just forget me
When I'm out all alone on the east coast
And please don't forgive me
When you're home all alone and you need me most
Oh, when you need me most
Yeah, when you need me most

Oh, if I only had the heart
Oh, if I only had the heart
Oh, if I only had the heart
Oh, if I only had the heart
Oh, if I only had the heart, the nerve, the words
Oh, if I only had the heart
You'd think by now I would have learned

Please just forget me
When I'm out all alone on the east coast
And please don't forgive me
When you're home all alone and you need me most
Yeah, when you need me most
Oh, when you need me most
