I want you to stop
To sit and think
Of all the times you tried to steal from me
Ride my coat tails
Use my name
Your smiles exposed all your fangs
Your forked tongue is always running
Spilling from your mouth
I suggest you bind it up and keep it
Keep it to yourself

You make me sick
Just go away!
I'm exposing all of your fangs
Your tongue is poisoning
You serpent, you snake
You make me sick

Sick!

The apple in your mouth
Comes from the riches made from me
Keep it
Eat it
Have your fill
I hope you're choking

Like a snake with my foot on your head
Don't want you dead
Need you alive
To feel every moment when I crush it

You disgust me

You make me sick
Just go away
I'm exposing all of your fangs
Your tongue is poisoning
Feeding on the weak
You serpent, you snake
You make me

Sick!

I'm nauseous
You're wretched
With false power you've gone mad
Unhinged and disgusting

I'm nauseous
You're wretched
With false power you've gone mad
Unhinged and disgusting
You're gruesome and you're grim

All you do is make me feel exactly what you are
All you do is make me feel exactly what you are
You make me sick

You serpent
You lying snake
You make me sick!
