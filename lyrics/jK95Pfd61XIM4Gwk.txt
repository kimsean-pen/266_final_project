Mmm, uh, mmm, yeah
Mmm-mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm, uh, mmm-mmm, yeah
Mmm-mmm, yeah, yeah

Baby I just don't get it, do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories, you know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why

If I was ya man, baby you'd
Never worry 'bout, what I do
I'd be coming home, back to you
Every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman, deserves good things
Fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby, you're a star
I just want to show you, you are

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby you should let me love you, love you, love you, love you, yeah
Listen

Your true beauty's description looks so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame
Don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go they stop and stare
'Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes, out of control, baby you know

If I was ya man, baby you'd
Never worry 'bout, what I do
I'd be coming home, back to you
Every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman, deserves good things
Fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby, you're a star
I just want to show you, you are

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Ooh baby, good love and protection, woah
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me

You know you deserve better

With me and you it's whatever girl, hey
So can we make this thing ours?

You should let me love you
