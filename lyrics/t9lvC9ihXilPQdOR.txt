I can't see where we're going
I can't see where we're going
I wish I were somewhere else
That's fine son duly noted

Haven't left here in awhile
Haven't left here in a very long while
Haven't left here in awhile
Haven't left here in a very long while

It was a chance occurence
That led you through that current
Moment and flowing through it
Motor and churning to it

Didn't notice for a while
Didn't notice for a very long while
Didn't notice for a while
Didn't notice for a very long while

Do you see why I am open?
Do you see why I am open?
Do you see why I am open?
Do you see why I am open?
