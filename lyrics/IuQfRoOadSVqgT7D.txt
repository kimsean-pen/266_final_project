Sweet disposition
Never too soon
Oh, reckless abandon
Like no one's watching you

A moment, a love
A dream, aloud
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs

A moment, a love (a moment, a love)
A dream, aloud
A moment, a love (a moment, a love)
A dream, aloud

So stay there
'Cause I'll be comin' over
While our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
Won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender

Songs of desperation
I played them for you

A moment, a love
A dream, aloud
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love (a moment, a love)
A dream, aloud
A moment, a love (a moment, a love)
A dream, aloud

Just stay there
'Cause I'll be comin' over
While our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
Won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender

(A moment, a love
A dream, aloud
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs)
Won't stop 'til it's over

(A moment, a love
A dream, aloud
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs)
Won't stop 'til it's over

(A moment, a love
A dream, aloud
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs)
Won't stop 'til it's over

(A moment, a love
A dream, aloud
A moment, a love
A moment, a love)
Won't stop to surrender
