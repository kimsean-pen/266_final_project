I met you, the year I stopped fearing my body
The sky split opened above me
It was a pleasure to meet your pain
In my shadow, you're a model of reason
Don't coddle don't tease me
Don't wake a swarm of bees beneath me

Do, Do, Do you want tenderness?
Kiss your mouth for tenderness
Settle down for tenderness

I've been taught, I should wait to be chosen
That I haven't known love
Until I've been destroyed by love
Certain men, can smell a wound a room away
You are melancholy well
Beauty only made you lonelier

Do, Do, Do you want tenderness?
Split your lip for tenderness
Curse your name for tenderness

Do, Do, Do you want tenderness?
Tenderness
Tenderness

Do, Do, Do you want tenderness?
Break your leg for tenderness
Walk away for tenderness

I left town, tucked myself into a mountain
Became something dark and hungry
Still the creek was muttering your name
Now your face half lit, electronic
You no longer need to speak your sentiments
I no longer perform innocence
