There's this girl I don't know
Comes by every year or so
And if I get the mail before my mum does
Then I will stay out of trouble
She'll change every year
Even pretty without beer
She doesn't care about my hair
My car, my tiny pee pee in the mirror

Whoo, yeah!
She's finally here
Whoo, yeah!
She comes one time a year
Whoo, yeah!
She's finally here
Whoo, yeah!
My Playmate Of The Year
She moves me
She makes me grow
I'm so happy and boy does it show
Now she's going to my head
She's going to my head
I'm gonna make this milky clear
You're my Playmate Of The Year

Hello how are you
It's great to see you too
Let's grab a sock
It's time to rock
And afterwards
You never want to talk
We always agree
Who's in charge here is me
We never fight
You know I'm right
It's always straight between you and me

Let me go down on this girl for a day
We can play spin the bottle
Everyone can hear her say
That I was the best she's ever had
She could be my playmate
And she could call me dad

Whoo, yeah!
She's finally here
Whoo, yeah!
Comes one time a year
Whoo, yeah!
She's finally here
Whoo, yeah!
My Playmate Of The Year
She moves me
She makes me grow
I'm so happy and boy does it show
Now she's going to my head
She's going to my head
I'm gonna make this milky clear
You're my Playmate Of The Year

Whoo, yeah!
She's finally here
My Playmate Of The Year
She moves me
She makes me grow
I'm so happy and boy does it show
Now she's going to my head
She moves me
She makes me grow
I'm so happy and boy does it show
Now she's going to my head
She's going to my head
I'm gonna make this milky clear
You're my Playmate Of The Year
