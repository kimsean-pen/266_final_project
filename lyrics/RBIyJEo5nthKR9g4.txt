I'm aching, past the point of breaking
What's right is right but here tonight you'll lie
Six feet under wondering why

Red meets the eye of the bull
Seemingly tongue-in-cheek
Forgive me for not laughing
It's closer now
I feel it in my bones like a dream
An overwhelming sensation
On the verge of psychotic, neurotic at best

I'm aching, past the point of breaking
What's right is right but here tonight you'll lie
Six feet under wondering why
Violent cravings, I've lost my mind
What's right is right but here tonight you'll lie
Six feet under wondering why

I feel it in my bones like a dream

I will bury you in the ground
Break, I will bury you
Eyes high to the sky
And now I feel it in my bones, like a dream
An overwhelming sensation in me

I'm aching, past the point of breaking
What's right is right but here tonight you'll lie
Six feet under wondering why
Violent cravings, I've lost my mind
What's right is right but here tonight you'll lie
Six feet under wondering why
(Wondering why)

Eyes high to the sky
Eyes high to the sky
Eyes high to the sky

I'm aching, past the point of breaking
What's right is right but here tonight you'll lie
Wondering why
