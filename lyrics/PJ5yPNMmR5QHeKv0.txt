This is not a dream?
What's happening to us?
Taylor 'bout to fucking flex

Cross on neck for the ones I hate
Friday's here, got the drugs in my veins
Pop two xans, now she want a good face
I got bands that I wanna go waste
Friday's here so don't be shy
Take me high up in the sky
Friday's here so let's be friends
Pop that seal the night won't end

Looked into her eyes, and turned to stone
She don't leave the club, 'cause she got no home
Bunch of random the numbers, always on her phone
Wonder what she's like when she all alone
Black dress with the heels, and her makeup on
Got the world in her hand, she can't do no wrong
Had to get another bottle just to get along
Got her singing every word when I play my song
Don't like her when she too cold
She just came for a drink and smoke
Don't like her, I like her though
Don't like her, don't want no more
Testing for disaster
There's no happy ever after
Through the jokes and all the laughter
Stab my back and turn the dagger
I got too much shit in my head, don't know where it went wrong
When the night's about to end she wanna throw up on my lawn
She said she don't wanna be here I told her to stay strong
I can't find the way she see it so I put it in a song
Small town kid, I'm a Hollywood boy
Tryna find himself, tryna find his voice
Never 'till now did he know here to go
Never 'till now did he wanna be alone
Rest in peace to my main boy Walkie
Do the dash in the whip, Ricky Bobby
Pop a perc now I'm feeling like a zombie
Drop a deuce in my sprite, call her Walkie (yeah, skrt)
Father told me that I'll never go far (go far)
Didn't listen, I was geeking off a bar (a bar)
That's the time, we was looking at the stars (stars)
That's the time 'cause I only just
turned 16 and I didn't know what love was
Yeah, aye didn't know what lust was
Whoa, R.I.P to a loved one
Aye, R.I.P to a loved one
Going hard, on the seat, finna take in
I can tell the whole time she was fakin'
Baby I just wanna know what your name is
Found her with my best friend, they were naked

Cross on neck for the ones I hate
Friday's here, got the drugs in my veins
Pop two xans, now she want a good face
I got bands that I wanna go waste
Friday's here so don't be shy
Take me high up in the sky
Friday's here so let's be friend
Pop that 'til the night, won't end

Imagine yourself
You just went to sleep
It was a hard day
You take a deep breath and close your eyes
And the nightmare begins

Last night, I think I made love with the devil
She turn my tears into diamonds on my bezel
After we finished, my heart felt like it'd been severed
I don't want to let this go, no not ever
Last night, was a fast night
Don't know what just happened last night, but it felt right
I don't what happened last night, last night
Don't want this to be my last night, last night
Don't know where I'm at, don't know where I've been
Baby please stay by my side, please don't let me sin
Open all the doors, keep on pouring fours yeah, aye
Yeah, all I want is more
Going to these places that I've never been before
Going buy designer, I might go and buy the store
Never will I drop a dime on top of fucking whore
Driving from my problems, skrt off in Aventador
This is my world I can do it how I want
I can write my own story, paint it with my own thoughts
I can see who I want, I can be who I am
I've been running downtown, with a bitch in my hands
Where you at? like what's up, haven't seen you in a month
Are you good?, are you great?, I've been tryna speculate
What's the deal? how you feel? how you lost all your appeal
What happend to our perfect duo Kobe and Shaquille
