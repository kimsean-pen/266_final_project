Well, the bottom of a river
that's no place for a man
especially one as well dressed as you
can I help you understand?
This ain't about forgiveness
this ain't about the ropes
but talk is cheap
you better watch your step
out here with these fools
cause these men are wolves.

These men are wolves.
These men are wolves.
These men are wolves.

I keep a fire burnin' through night and day
'cause that's the only way to keep the wolves at bay
it's not that they'll find you lying in your sleep
it's that nothing's gonna save you
from dying just like sheep, you're in to deep.

So don't be a fool
These men are wolves.
These men are wolves.
Don't be a fool
These men are wolves
