A hand above the water
An angel reaching for the sky
Is it raining in heaven,
Do you want us to cry?

And everywhere the broken-hearted
On every lonely avenue
No-one could reach them
No-one but you

One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flying too close to the sun
And life goes on,
Without you...

Another tricky situation
I get the drownin' in the blues
And I find myself thinkin'
Well - what would you do?

Yes! - it was such an operation
Forever paying every due
Hell, you made a sensation
You found a way through

And, one by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
We'll remember, forever...

And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leaving
Was in the way it was planned?

And so we grace another table
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never, never sayin' goodbye...

One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun

Cryin' for nothing
Cryin' for no-one
No-one but you...
