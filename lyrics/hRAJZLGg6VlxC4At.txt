I'm down on my knees
You read a paper or watch TV
Don't even say a single word to me
Talk to me

You're slippin' away
Sit around a trailer and sleep all day
Somethin' funny and you just won't say
It's not okay

Beverly
Come on and talk to me
Now that you're free to try
In the street
You're shakin' my self-esteem
Believe in the dream or not
Beverly, yeah

I'm screamin' your name
Bend over backwards while you watch the game
You're makin' faces just to feed the flame
It's such a shame

Beverly
Come on and talk to me
Now that you're free to try
In the street
You're shakin' my self-esteem
Believe in the dream or not
Beverly, yeah

Beverly
Come on and talk to me
Now that you're free to try
In the street
You're shakin' my self-esteem
Believe in the dream or not
Beverly, yeah
