I ain't tryna get in my feelings, but damn (But damn)
What's goin' on, bro? I thought you was fam (Was fam)
Got me like, "What the fuck wrong with him?"
Tryna beef over some pussy, that's funny (That's funny)
Can't believe this ho made you her crash dummy
The way you act, that ho pussy better be squirtin' out money
Platinum diamond, VVS' payin' taxes or somethin'
But it's okay, I understand, you just couldn't keep it a hunnid

While you locked up somebody else shovin' that dick in her stomach
I can't be beefin' bout these bitches, bruh, this shit gettin' old
Knowin' that pussy stainless steel, but yet you treat it like gold
They been showin' me that these
Nggas ain't real (Ain't real, fuck nigga)
Get caught up with that time, they gon' squeal (Gon' squeal)
These bitches ain't shit, these niggas ain't real (Ain't real)
Keep playin', your ass fuck 'round and get killed
What's goin' on, bro, I heard you were trippin' (Were trippin')
I thought you kept it real from beginnin'
Until I heard that track you made and I came to some suspicions
I can't believe to my surprise, one of my woadies sneak dissin'
Yeah, you turned cold, I can't fuck with you
It's like that Molly done turned you into a fuck nigga
Hold up, wait, bro, pose for the picture
You officially have been framed as a fuck nigga
And that's truth, this... ain't fuckin' with you at all
And look, they be snapped, but this fuck nigga ain't my dawg
That ain't my dawg no more
That ain't my dawg (No)
That ain't my dawg no more (Nah)

I ain't tryna get in my feelings, but damn (But damn)
What's goin' on, bro? I thought you was fam (Was fam)
And you mad at me about a bitch Instagram (Like damn)
Got me like, "What the fuck wrong with"
I can't be fuckin' with none of these niggas
'Cause all of these niggas be actin' like bitches
You know that I'm straight out of Indian River
I don't give no fuck about none of these niggas
We just tryna run up this mothafuckin' skrilla
All of my niggas, they really some killers
See you a pussy, I used to fuck with you
But then you turned cold on me, nigga what's up?
I cannot go, oh, oh like that (I can't go like that)
Can't believe you switched up like a ho like that
Like bruh, I know you ain't got many hoes like that
I would have let you have the bitch
I would have let you smash the bitch
I don't give a fuck, nigga (What?)
'Cause you're still a fuck nigga (What?)

And that time you let me hold your pistol
You should have bucked, nigga
Wait, I should've bucked you, nigga
But now I'm feelin' like fuck you, nigga (Fuck you)
And if this chopper ever catch you, it's hungry
It eat your bitch ass up for supper, nigga (Yum, yum, yum, yum)
Sometimes I wake up and I be in my feelings all night
Sometimes tell that I was reminiscin'
All of these bitches, they wasn't even missin' me
Now they all on me and they tryna kiss me
I thought that we were 51-50, but you could never be with us
These niggas claim they fuck with us, but really be the enemy

I ain't tryna get in my feelings, but damn (But damn)
What's goin' on, bro? I thought you was fam (Was fam)
And you mad at me about a bitch Instagram (Like damn)
Got me like, "What the fuck wrong with him?"
Tryna beef over some pussy, that's funny (That's funny)
Can't believe this ho made you her crash dummy
The way you act, that ho pussy better be squirtin' out money
Platinum diamond, VVS' payin' taxes or somethin'
But it's okay, I understand, you just couldn't keep it a hunnid
And you just couldn't keep it a hunnid
