On the fields of desolation
We are all alone
Crying in each others arms
In fear of the unknown
Feelings of uncertainty
We are all doomed
To live in solitude
And never ending gloom
On the fields of desolation
Eternal life or termination
Why don't you cover me
I need your sanctuary
This sea I'm drowning in
Might be where the end begins
In times of grief and sadness
We're searching for the light
Seek for a place of safety
Seek for a place to hide
God turned his back on man
In divine resignation
Torn between two believes
Eternal life or termination?
As we drown in darkness
Weak and depraved
On our final journey
Too late to be saved
We've gone through places
Where the cold wind blows
Is this the end of it all
I don't know, I don't know
