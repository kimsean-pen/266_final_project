Love is the name
in the wind
the wind blows through
the trees and stars

we make a wish
to be
together

this night
when we dream
together
we'll remember
when we dream
together

the time has come
to say the words
we want to hear
the time has come
to say the words
we want to hear

love is the name
in the wind
the wind blows through
the trees and stars

we make a wish
to be
together

this night
when we dream
together
we'll remember
when we dream
together

it's the big dream
it's the big dream
