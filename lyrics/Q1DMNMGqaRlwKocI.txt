A giant bright eagle has come
on me and taken away my universe
I find myself in trouble now
I put my soul in irresponsible hands

exhausted I no longer try to reveal myself
and I no longer want to free my soul
But I must not forget all what I did for us
This way I feel myself irreplaceable

You had finally come to death
and you will never come to life again
Burn ego's black reality
bring on the light I want to see your face

I feel the end is near for me my world goodbye
people of the dead, I join you
in this confusion I don't even recall my name
there is something inside I want to reveal

I feel like I'm a part of this
and this a part of me
I know one must have confidence
I will overcome

From now on I'm "this", and not "me"
I feel like I'm rising from the dead
From up here I see my inner world is dying
I'll overcome my pain
