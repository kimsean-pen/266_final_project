I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance,
Given half a chance
And I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes

I have been blind

The Lady In Red
Is dancing with me
(Cheek to cheek)

There's no body here,
It's just you and me
It's where I want to be
But I hardly know
This beauty by my side
I'll never forget

The way you look tonight

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright,
You were amazing

I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled,
It took my breath away
I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
As I do tonight

The Lady In Red
Is dancing with me
(Cheek to cheek)
There's no body here,
It's just you and me
It's where I want to be
But I hardly know
This beauty by my side
I'll never forget
The way you look tonight
I never will forget
The way you look tonight...
The Lady In Red,
The Lady In Red
The Lady In Red,
My lady in red...
(I love you...)
