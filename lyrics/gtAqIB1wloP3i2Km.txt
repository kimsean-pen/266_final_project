Car's dyin',
Not a lot of money,
Scared to check my checkin' account,
I guess I'm walkin' for now,
But at least I'm finally gettin' exercise.
Bus ridin',
Some dudes were mean muggin',
Got a blackened eye and a cameo appearance on Cops,
But at least I'm finally gettin' televised.

Well I could,
Focus on the hate,
Relive yesterday,
And block out all the sunshine.
Or I could,
Focus on my lane,
Just live for today,
Sights set on the bright side.
Oh-Oh

Hey, I'm gonna make a smile out of that frown,
We could turn it upside down,
We could turn it upside down,
So sing it loud,
Oh, until they put me six feet underground,
We could turn it upside down,
We could turn it upside down.
We could now.

Bicycle,
Runnin' late and rushin',
Looked down for a second and slammed into a car in the lot,
But at least I'm getting outta work tonight,
Hospital,
Got my third concussion,
Callin' up my boss to explain, he says I'm losin' my job,
But at least I got more time to ride my bike.

Well I could,
Focus on the pain,
Relive yesterday,
And block out all the sunshine.
Or I could,
Focus on my lane,
Just live for today,
Sights set on the bright side.
Oh-Oh

Hey, I'm gonna make a smile out of that frown,
We could turn it upside down,
We could turn it upside down,
So sing it loud,
Oh, until they put me six feet underground,
We could turn it upside down,
We could turn it upside down.
We could now.

Da da da turn it upside down,
Da da da turn it upside down,
You know that we'll be turning it upside down.
(One more time!)
Da da da turn it upside down,
Da da da turn it upside down,
You know that we'll be turning it upside down.
(Sing it now)

Upside down
(Alright let's get it)
Upside down
(How we turnin' it?)
Upside down
(Lemme hear you!)
Upside down!

Yeah!

Upside down
Sing it now

Hey, I'm gonna make a smile out of that frown,
We could turn it upside down,
We could turn it upside down,
So sing it loud,
Oh, until they put me six feet underground,
We could turn it upside down,
We could turn it upside down.
We could now.

Da da da turn it upside down,
Da da da turn it upside down,
You know that we'll be turning it upside down.
(Sing it now)
Da da da turn it upside down,
