Remembering what you said
Now, I'm layin' alone in bed
Tryna wrap up this feeling
Fallin' apart instead
'Cause baby we hit the top
Sweeter than sugar rock
Holding onto a moment
Let go, I'm fallin' off

I just need a little of it
Need a little, not a lot
To get into it, oh
Keep callin' me home

Can we go back to adrenaline? ('drenaline)
Can we go back to adrenaline? ('drenaline)
Girl you know that
We've been settlin', settlin'
(But...)
But I need to feel
Need to feel it
Adrenaline

Remembering all those nights
With your body straight to the sky
You'd work me until the morning
Fall asleep half past nine (a.m.)
So crazy in love
And enough was never enough
Tell me our touch ain't dull now
Tell me our touch ain't dull now

I just need a little of it
Need a little, not a lot
To get into it, oh
Keep callin' me home

Can we go back to adrenaline? ('drenaline)
Can we go back to adrenaline? ('drenaline)
Girl you know that
We've been settlin', settlin'
(But...)
But I need to feel
Need to feel it
Adrenaline

And I don't know where the ceilin' is
Anymore, oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh
Anymore, oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh

No, I don't know where the feelin' is
Anymore, oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh
Anymore, oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh

No, I don't, don't, (dont!)
Can we go back to adrenaline? ('drenaline)
(Can we go back from here?)
Can we go back to adrenaline? ('drenaline)
(Can we go back from here?)
Girl you know that
We've been settlin', settlin'
(But...)
But I need to feel
Need to feel it
Adrenaline

(Oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh)
(Anymore, oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh)
Can we go back from here? (Oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh)
(Anymore, oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh)
Can we go back from here? (Oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh)
(Anymore, oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh)
Can we got back from here?
'Cause I need to feel
Need to feel it
Adrenaline
