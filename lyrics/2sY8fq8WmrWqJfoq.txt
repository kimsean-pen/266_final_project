We rise, we fall, we weep
But when love's walking down my street
I know that sound
I just forget my war
And whisper to you through the door
Keep me, that's all

But I tell you, don't want to lose it
I tell you, don't want to prove it
Let's start with zero

But I tell you, don't want to lose it
I tell you, don't want to prove it
Let's start with zero

One day I'll find my pace
Give up the past and it's mistakes
Boy, all by myself
I like playing with joy
But when the dark becomes my home
I lose my soul

But I tell you, don't want to lose it
I tell you, don't want to prove it
Let's start with zero

Forget the rest
I will keep the best
I start with you
I start for you

Tell me slowly
You'll invent me
All things can be
Make me believe in home

But I tell you, don't want to lose it
I tell you, don't want to prove it
Let's start with zero

But I tell you, don't want to lose it
I tell you, don't want to lose it
I tell you, don't want to prove it
Let's start with zero

But I tell you, don't want to lose it
Let's start with zero
