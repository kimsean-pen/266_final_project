trouble...
I don't look for trouble,
But trouble looks for me
And it's been waiting around corners,
Since I was seventeen.
They say "Here comes a hurricane,
Trouble is her middle name!"
But I don't look for trouble,
Yeah trouble looks for me
Hey hey!

I don't look for trouble,
But trouble looks for me
And it's been waiting around corners,
Since I was seventeen.
They say "Here comes a hurricane,
Trouble is her middle name!"
But I don't look for trouble,
Yeah trouble looks for me
hey hey...

I just want to live a quiet life,
I'll make an excellent wife,
Man I swear I really try
But some boys they just can't eat it whole,
Trouble is my name you know.
(Trouble is my name you know.)

I don't look for trouble,
But trouble looks for me,
And it's been waiting around corners,
Since I was seventeen
They say "Here comes a hurricane,
Trouble is her middle name!"
But I don't look for trouble,
Yeah trouble looks for me.
Hey hey!

Hey!
Hey hey!
Hey!
Hey hey!

Hey!
Hey hey!
Hey!
Hey hey!

I don't look for trouble,
But trouble looks for me,
And it's been waiting around corners,
Since I was seventeen
They say that you,
Got so many sides
I'm a Gemini,
But I don't look for trouble,
Trouble looks for me

hey hey...
Hey!

Hey hey!

Lights up, let's have a toke.
Pour more whiskey in my Coke.
Never been one of the herd,
Flipping everyone the bird.
People say that I am heartless,
I've just learned to use my heart less.
I go hard 'cause I'm the hardest,
And we ain't even started yet!

Hey!
Hey hey!
Hey!
Hey hey!
Hey!
Hey hey!
Hey!
Hey hey!
Trouble!

I don't look for trouble,
But trouble looks for me,
And it's been waiting around corners,
Since I was seventeen
They say "Here comes a hurricane,
Trouble is her middle name!"
But I don't look for trouble,
Yeah trouble looks for me

Hey hey!

I don't look for trouble,
But trouble looks for me,
And it's been waiting around corners,
Since I was seventeen
They say "Here comes a hurricane,
Trouble is her middle name!"
But I don't look for trouble,
Yeah trouble looks for me
Hey hey!

Trouble!
