I was told loneliness was like spaces between the stars
Well, its empty between these starry eyes
I was told a dead man was heavier than a broken heart,
Am I dead now?
My heart sure feels heavy

And i try not to feel
I try not to feel
Its so hard to believe it

I was told that time tip-toed by
I can hear his footsteps running past me
I was told i had a face with nothing to fear
Thats not the first thing that scared me

And i try not to feel
Oh I try not to feel
Its so hard to believe it
But in the end of it all. its true
You shot this bullet through my bones
You shot this bullet,
Through my bones.

You shot me down
Down down ago
You shot me down
Down down ago

I get up, take the phone from my hands
The glass from my lips
The pictures, from my finger-tips
I stand up, walk round and round
I dont hear no sound cause it's only the words
That you last spoke to me

And i try not feel it
Oh i try not to feel it
Its so hard to believe it
But in the end of it all, it's true
You shot this bullet through my bones
You shot this bullet, through my bones

You shot me down
Down down ago
You shot me down
Down down ago
You shot me down
Down down ago
You shot me down
Down down ago
