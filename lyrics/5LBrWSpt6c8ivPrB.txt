It pays to kill
Anyone who has information
In the park, we hide behind rocks
We urinate on rocks
Until the sun comes up
Encrypted in flesh
Concrete soaked in sweat
We lived in Lake Somerset
It was south of Dallas Highway
Just east of a drained lake
Orchids dissolve
Equations solved
Psychic landscape
To know there is a limit to what you can experience
These walls I know, I grew up here
(No satisfaction)
