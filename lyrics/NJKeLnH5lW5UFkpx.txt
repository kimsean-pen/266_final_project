Oh woah
Oh woah
You're not drowning, you're not lost
You're not broken, you're not star crossed
Keep you far, keep you far from what I know
You'll be fine, you'll be fine just don't look closely, now
We'll run straight through the valley, and into where you want it to be
Swim past the shadows
In the words that echo off the streams
If you're lookin' for truth, don't come looking for me
You're better off not knowing
'Cause your own story, is the safest place you'll ever be
Oh woah
I was hoping that you'd be fine
Lies unfolding, cover you're eyes
Keep you far, keep you far from what I know
You'll be fine, you'll be fine just don't look closely, now
We'll run straight through the valley, and into where you want it to be
Swim past the shadows
In the words that echo off the streams
If you're lookin' for truth, don't come looking for me
You're better off not knowing
'Cause your own story, is the safest place you'll ever be
You'll ever be, you'll ever be
Oh woah
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Keep you far, keep you far from what I know
You'll be fine, you'll be fine just don't look closely, now

We'll run straight through the valley, and into where you want it to be
Swim past the shadows
In the words that echo off the streams
If you're lookin' for truth, don't come looking for me
You're better off not knowing
'Cause your own story, is the safest place you'll ever be
