This feels familiar, I know I been here before
I know this game, I've played it well and lost the war

I bet on love, did my best to find it
Maybe I'm fit perfect for loneliness, still deciding
I'm kind of over you and your endless ways to keep trying
You keep trying, no no no no

Stop doing what you're doing, you won't win me over
And I'll just keep rollin' my eyes
I move away and you come in a little closer
But I don't want you tonight
I'm solo tonight
I'm solo tonight
I'm solo
I'm solo

I'm not the type to go and fall right at your feet
Every time I try to leave, you wanna follow me

I bet on love, did my best to find it
Maybe I'm fit perfect for loneliness, still deciding
I'm kind of over you and your endless ways to keep trying
You keep trying, no no no no

Stop doing what you're doing, you won't win me over
And I'll just keep rollin' my eyes
I move away and you come in a little closer
But I don't want you tonight
I'm solo tonight
I'm solo tonight
I'm solo
I'm solo

Solo, I
I wanna be solo
Solo, I
I wanna be solo

Stop doing what you're doing, you won't win me over
And I'll just keep rollin' my eyes
I move away and you come in a little closer
But I don't want you tonight
I'm solo tonight
I'm solo tonight
I'm solo tonight
I'm solo tonight
I'm solo tonight
I'm solo tonight
