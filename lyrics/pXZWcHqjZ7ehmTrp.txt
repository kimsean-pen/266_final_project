Oh darlin'
Don't be so scared of what I find within
I want to taste your essence
Oh darlin'
Every time you try to run away
It'll only bring me closer

There are pieces you don't like
Hiding all the grace of being human I might find

Woah Let Me Love You
Let Me Love You
You're beautiful and I just want you to know
Let Me Love You
Let Me Love You
I believe in you do you believe in me?

Oh darlin'
I cherish all the shadows of your past
Even the darkest ones
Oh darlin'
In tenderness I hold your beating heart
You can be vulnerable again

You're internal but you are kind
With no conditions I will climb on our memories
I walk in solace by your side
(Forever)
I am yours and you are mine

Woah Let Me Love You
Let Me Love You
You're beautiful and I just want you to know
Let Me Love You
Let Me Love You
I believe in you do you believe in me?

Oh Let Me Love You
Let Me Love You
You're beautiful and I just want you to know
Let Me Love You
Let Me Love You
You're beautiful!
Oh Let Me Love You
Let Me Love You
I believe in you do you believe in me?
