Maybe I should tell you now
I was on a train to meet yor friends and family
To let go of that part of me

Baby if you hear me now
We were at the table listening to "Skinny Love"
And dacing to the song

In the room that I met your mother
In the room that we were almost lovers
I could feel, I could feel you there
I could feel, I could feel you

In the room that I met your mother
In the room that we were almost lovers
I could feel, I could feel you there
I could feel, I could feel you

I'll never get to hold your hand
I'll get get to
I'll never get another chance
I'll never get to
You

Been nobody here since I
Found myself in London
Living in your memory
Revisiting our history

In the room that I met your mother
In the room that we were almost lovers
I could feel, I could feel you there
I could feel, I could feel you

Ohh
I'll never get to hold your hand
I'll get get to
I'll never get another chance
I'll never get to

(In the room that I met your mother)
I'll never get to hold your hand
(In the room that we were almost lovers)
I'll never get to
(I could feel, I could feel you there)
(Another chance)
I'll never get to hold your hand
(I could feel, I could feel you)
I'll never get to

In the room that I met your mother
In the room that we were almost lovers
I could feel, I could feel you there
I could feel, I could feel you
