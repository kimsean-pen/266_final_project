I've been thinking that you and
I should get to know each other better
Maybe even you could ditch your boyfriend
Someday later when I get out
Maybe you and me could be together
Maybe even for more than just the weekend

Maybe even we could fall in love

I've been thinking of all the ways
That we could break some
Rules and take some stuff
Get a good thing going and never stop it
Tell me about the craziest thing
That you've ever done, baby, just for fun
I'll bet you anything that we can top it
Bet you anything

If you get too scared, just run away
Run away
Though I would prefer that you would stay

Maybe even we could
Rob a bank or three
Ain't no telling what we
Could get away with
Use the money to get married,
Maybe even start a family
We could get a little place
Down on the beach
Ooh - maybe even - maybe
Even we could fall in love

If you get too scared,
just run away
Run away
Though I would prefer
That you would stay
You would stay
You know I'd do
Anything for you
Anything for you
And together there's
Nothing we couldn't do

Maybe even we could
Rob a bank or three
Ain't no telling what we
Could get away with
Use the money to get married,
Maybe even start a family
We could get a little place
Down on the beach
Ooh - maybe even - maybe
Even we could fall in love
Maybe even we could fall in love
Maybe even we could fall in love
