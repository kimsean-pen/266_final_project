Today I found my soul
I felt it die inside of me, yeah
So I turn to you
Life is like that you know.
I have your face in a photo in high school
When you were alive, but that's all I have
And I can't remember who I was myself then
And it doesn't help
Still I looked to you as a friend
To tell me

Who we are now, who we are
It's who we are now, who we are
Where does time go now on a wake for young souls?
To tell me

Who we are now, who we are
It's who we are now, who we are
Where does time go now on a wake for young souls?
Like a lullaby you sing oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh
Well the wind that blows
It's blowing colder
And the child that grows
She's growing older

And the friends we know
They'll turn a shoulder
But the friends we know
They're growing colder so
It's who we are now, who we are
It's who we are now, who we are
Where does time go now on a wake for young souls?

You tell me, who we are now, who we are
It's who we are now, who we are
Oh no, on a wake for young souls
Na na na na na na... (where's my soul?)x3
Cycle of the moon brings blood to the woman
In the blood of the woman brings birth of a child
Child grow up
Keep forgetting something
Birth of a child comes someplace while you
Even grey days beat the shade to wean
Unbodied unsouled unheard unseen
Let the gift be grown in the time to call our own
Let the gift be sewn before the windows closing

Truth is natural like a wind that blows

Follow the direction no matter where it goes
So it shall be the earth and the sea
Let the truth blow like a hurricane through me
Oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oooh...
If I've been cold, if I've spoken in anger
To have been bold
Forgive me
You know I don't see your mother
Not like before
Though she hasn't forgotten

She doesn't like to be reminded anymore
Annie got married
It didn't come without tears
Like the day you died I had laughter for these years
So it's who we are now, who we are
It's who we are now, who we are
Where does time go now on a wake for young souls now
It's who we are now, who we are
It's who we are now, who we are
Whoa no on a wake for young souls
Other things we know
Are gonna fall away from me
Like a grain of sand, slips through a good friend's hand.
