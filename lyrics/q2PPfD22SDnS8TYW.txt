Say, what you wanna need to say
Just hide away
I'm sick of remaining in walls that are just made of smoke
Your lies and the fake
Let's go in vain while you're the only one who falls

How can you just be so proud?
When all you did was tell all those lies
But you're doing wrong this time
I know who you are

'Cause I can read between your lines
And if you fool me once
I can bet you won't do it twice
I try to keep it black and white
And if you want the truth,
Never play with me you'll regret it

Shame, that you're always the same
To all your friends
That you are ready to sell them out, anytime
To save your own face
Now can't you see that you're a new self in my size

How can you just be so proud?
When all you did was tell all those lies
But you're doing wrong this time
I know who you are

I've seen, so many times
The way you try to bring me down
You're made of proportionate mind
But it's time to shake the lies
Shake the lies

'Cause I can read between your lines
And if you fool me once
I can bet you won't do it twice
I try to keep it black and white
And if you want the truth,
Never play with me you'll regret it

It's time for getting you down
Get back on solid ground
And all you have
Is arms ready to fall down

It's time for getting you down
Get back on solid ground
And all you have
Is arms ready to fall down

Let me try, let me fight
Take a breath now is the time
Rise and fall, take it all
Breaking down all of these walls

Let me try, let me fight
Let me do this one more time
Rise and fall, take it all
Breaking down all of these walls

My heart, it's like I'm being denied
You unjudge me

'Cause I can read between your lines
And if you fool me once
I can bet you won't do it twice
I try to keep it black and white
And if you want the truth,
Never play with me you'll regret it

It's time for getting you down
Get back on solid ground
And all you have
Is arms ready to fall down

It's time for getting you down
Get back on solid ground
And all you have
Is arms ready to fall down
