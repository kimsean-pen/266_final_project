God, if you're still watching
There's no more happy days
God, if you're still watching
There's no more celebration

Love, I need a ride
I need a proper high
Love, I'm on your side
But we were never good, no

Boy, can you hear me now?
I got a golden ticket, I'm out
Boy, can you hear me shout?
I got a golden ticket, I'm out
I'm already gone, I'm out
I'm already gone, I'm out

Love, I need a light
I need a proper high
God, I really tried
But we were never good, no

Boy, can you hear me now?
I got a golden ticket, I'm out
Boy, can you hear me shout?
I got a golden ticket, I'm out
I'm already gone, I'm out
I'm already gone, I'm out

I have been madness (I have been war)
I have been reckless (I have been sore)
I have been silence (I have been bored)
I have been vibrant (I have been bored)
I have been madness (I have been war)
I have been sadness

I've got a golden ticket
I've got a golden ticket

Boy, can you hear me now?
I've got a golden ticket, I'm out
Boy, can you hear me shout?
I've got a golden ticket, I'm out
I'm already gone, I'm out
I'm already gone, I'm out
I'm already gone, I'm out
I got a golden ticket, I'm out
