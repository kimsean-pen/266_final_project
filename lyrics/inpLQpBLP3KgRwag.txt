I am a dead man, I'm crawling into a trap.
A horizontal response, I'm laying down for you once again.
You've taking what's granted.
I've said goodbye to my friends,
I've thrown myself headfirst into this.
Close the curtain and strand me.
Found myself lost again, with even more excuses,
and even less concern.
Bound and gagged but I enjoy it,
you seduce your prisoner before you take your turn.

So lay me down in the field and put me under the trees in the tall grass,
where they won't find me.
Enjoying silence and peace until the sirens they come back screaming,
taking me away.
I've given all I can give
so don't let me go back between Woodward and Cass,
cracked concrete and broken glass.

This run down block with my name in lights.
Your saving grace, my final rites.
11 Miles from where I was when I conceded my head,
embraced my lost control.
Innocence in a state so pure,
you hear the demons calling to take back what you stole.

So lay me down in this field and put me under the trees in the tall grass
where they won't find me.
Enjoying silence and peace until the sirens they come back screaming,
taking me away.
I lost a piece of myself, and i forgot to slow down and just breathe and it's scaring me.
I've given all I can give so don't let me go.

I am a dead man and It's the only way it can end.
I don't know who's side I'm on anymore and there's no starting over.
