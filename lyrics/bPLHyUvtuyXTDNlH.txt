Oh please, let it rain today
This city is so filthy, like my mind in ways
Oh, there was a time, like a clean, new taste
Smiling eyes before me, inches from my face

Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love

Sin to sell, buying just a need
Who planted all the devils seeds?
And what the truth, the truth that lies at home
It's on the inside, and I can't get it off

Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love

What's clean is pure, but hey
I'm white on the outside, though I stray
What she don't know today might kill us both tomorrow
Bring it back someway
Bring it back, bring it back
Back to the clean form
To the pure form
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my
Wash my
Wash my love
