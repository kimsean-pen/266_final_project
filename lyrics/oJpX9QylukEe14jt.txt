You know the hurt's so deep
That I can't sleep or eat
And what I'm hoping for
Is to feel your kisses sweet
If we could just talk
Things might be a little more clear
I really need the chance
To explain the way I feel

I can't sleep (can't sleep)
Thinking of you constantly
I can't sleep (can't sleep)
Wishing you were here with me
I can't sleep (can't sleep)
(Where are you, baby)

When I get home from work
Sit down and watch TV
The night falls
Just like a bad dream

I can't sleep (can't sleep)
Thinking of you constantly
I can't sleep (can't sleep)
Wishing you were here with me
I can't sleep (can't sleep)
(Where are you, baby)

I can't sleep (can't sleep)
Thinking of you constantly
I can't sleep (can't sleep)
Wishing you were here with me
I can't sleep (can't sleep)
(Where are you, baby)
