I was just a card, caught up in the stars,
Looking down to Mars.
You know, you know
He knows, he knows something
About me that I don't want him to know.

Never found a solid hand till I found that man,
Till I found that man of mine.
You were looking at me, thinking,
Who is she?

Never knew the sky was white till I took that flight,
Till I took that flight to him,
Tonight.

I was just a card, caught up in the stars,
Looking down to Mars.
You know, you know
I know, I know something
About you that you don't want me to know.

Could've sworn I had that man when he took my hand,
When he took my hand down near you.
You were looking at me, thinking,
Who am I?

Didn't even see the night till I said goodbye,
Till I said goodbye to him,
Tonight.
