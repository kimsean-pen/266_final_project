Poor kids pouring cold water in their cereal
Second hand clothes
Surviving is pivotal
Praying to God at night
That things'll get better soon
I remember when I was in your position
Tried to tell people my story
But no one would really listen
I know times are hard right now
And happiness is hard to find right now

You got to keep on keepin' on
You got to keep your head up high
You gotta work with what you've got
And someday you will fly
You got to keep on keepin' on
You got to keep your head up high
You gotta work with what you've got
And someday you will fly

Lookin out the window to the rose grows in concrete
Dreamin' of the day when you'll be standing on your own feet
Hard to find the good in such a scene so bad, seems so sad
Seein' other kids with their Timbs on
Fresh with Air Ones, wish I had one, had one
Longing for a day when you get your chance to shine
Don't worry, there'll come a time

You got to keep on keepin' on
You got to keep your head up high
(Oh you gotta keep your head up high)
You gotta work with what you've got
And someday you will fly
You got to keep on keepin' on
You got to keep your head up high
You gotta work with what you've got
And someday you will fly

Young girl sittin' on the steps of her duplex
Why did God choose to make my life so complex
Breathing to the beat of a slow, sad drum
Trouble is her only source of fun
I can almost guarantee you
It'll get better soon

You got to keep on keepin' on
You got to keep your head up high
You gotta work with what you've got
(You got, to work with what you've got baby)
And someday you will fly
You got to keep on keepin' on
(Keep on keepin' on)
You got to keep your head up high
You gotta work with what you've got
And someday you will fly

Keep on keepin' on
You gotta
You gotta work with what you've got
