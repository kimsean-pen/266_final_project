I faced my demons
Wresling these angels to the ground
And all that I could find
Was a thin line between
All the saints and villains
It was crossed in my own mind

Someday I'm gonna find it
Wish I knew what I was looking for
Inside the disarray (inside the disarray)
I woke up this morning
Don't know where I'm going
But it's alright
I wouldn't have it any other way

Struggling between the facts and fiction
I'm alone
But I'm alive
Everyone around me is trying to make a statement
Then there's me
I'm just trying to survive

Someday I'm gonna find it
Wish I knew what I was looking for
Inside the disarray (inside the disarray)
I woke up this morning
Don't know where I'm going
But it's alright
I wouldn't have it any other way

If this was any other day
I'd pretend to know where I stand
I just don't know
(I just don't know)
(I just don't know)

Someday I'm gonna find it
Wish I knew what I was looking for
Inside the disarray (inside the disarray)
I woke up this morning
Don't know where I'm going
But it's alright
I wouldn't have it any other way

Someday I will find it
Wish I knew what I was looking for
Inside the disarray (inside the disarray)
I woke up this morning
Don't know where I'm going
But it's alright
