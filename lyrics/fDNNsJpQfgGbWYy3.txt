I awoke in a dream
An evil one, a setting sun
I licked your hatred
You set me free
In summer, in the boiling blood

Oh baby, I'll carry your disease
That darkness that lives inside you deep
Oh honey, I'll put up a fight with death
He's never coming near my love again

All the world moves inside my baby,
I see it there
Rows and rows, mouths of fjords â€“
I swim in them in my dreams

Oh baby, I'll carry your disease
That darkness that lives inside you deep
Oh honey, I'll put up a fight with death
He's never coming near my love again

Oh baby, I'll carry your disease
That darkness that lives inside you deep
Oh honey, I'll put up a fight with death
He's never coming near my love again
He's never coming near my love again
He's never coming near my love again
