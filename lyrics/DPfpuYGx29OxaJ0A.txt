I've been trying just to pull it through
This ramblin' road
Spent some time in a common place
In everyone
Who'd been burned like a thousand times
Just wastin' away
They'd arranged for the bitter man
To take them away

Fell in line with the racketeers
From head to toe
Fell in line with the racketeers
From layin' low
In the darkest point of night
I want you
To be here like before
Comin' through

Yeah, goin' back to the root of my beliefs
And all that is lost
Spent some time in a common place
And nowhere to go
That's the sound of a million ships
Just sailin' away
Yeah, it can feel like before
Comin' through either way
Let it feel like before
Comin' through either way, alright
