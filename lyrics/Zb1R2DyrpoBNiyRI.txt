You've been hanging out for quite awhile now
Livin' off of people you know
Trying to raise a little money
To pay off all the monkeys
That you met inside the rabbit hole

You're taking candy from the white witch
You're smokin' tea with Mama Kin
Well theres a wolf outside a brick house
Screamin' "This time I'm gonna blow it in!"

Because the mind is a weapon, see?
And its got you on your hands and knees
Pull the trigger if you're gonna
We all know that you wanna
Count off one, two, one, two, three!

You better pray that theres another way out
You better pray that someones listening now (and doesn't want to watch you drown)
'Cuz when you lie like the devil himself
No angels gonna hear your cry for help

I know you must really think its funny
You had everybody fooled in the end
But its a little unassuming considered how you knew me
I'm the only one that called you a friend

Because the mind is a weapon, see?
But you're not gonna use it on me
Pull the trigger if you're gonna
We all know that you wanna
Count off one, two, one, two, three!

(You better pray that theres another way out

For help
