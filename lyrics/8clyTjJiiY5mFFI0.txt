In the desert sun ev'ry step that you take could be the final one.
And in the burning heat
hanging on the edge of destruction.
No
you can't stop the pain of your children crying out in your head

They always said that the living would envy the dead.

So now you're gonna shoot
shoot bullets of fire

don't wanna fight
but sometimes you've got to.
You're some soul survivor

and there's just one thing you've got to know:
You've got ten more thousand miles to go because you're
one of the living - and if you can't stick together

well
you're one of the living - who's gonna make it tonight?

Walk tall
cool
collected
but savage.
Walk tall
bruised
sensual
ravaged.
It's ev'ry man for himself
ev'ry woman
ev'ry child

a new breed
ferocious and wild.

And all they wanna do is shoot bullets of fire

they wanna fight
but sometimes you've got to.
You're some soul survivor

and there's just one thing you've got to know:
You've got ten more thousand miles to go because you're
one of the living - and if you can't stick together

well
you're one of the living - who's gonna make it tonight?

You're one of the living - and if we can't stick together

well
you're one of the living - who's gonna make it tonight?

Shoot bullets of fire
...
You're one of the living - and if we can't stick together
...
You're one of the living - and if we can't stick together
...
You're one of the living - and if we can't stick together
