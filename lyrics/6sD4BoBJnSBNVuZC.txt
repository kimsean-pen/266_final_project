Don't open my door
To the outside world
Don't open my door
The cold outside world
I'm movin to a place
A place where no one knows my name
I miss you little girl
I hope you miss me just the same
Just the same

Don't open my door
To your outside world
Don't open my door
The cold outside world
I'm movin to a place
250 miles away
I miss you little girl
I hope you miss me just the same
Just the same
