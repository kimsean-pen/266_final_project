I dreamed the current left the galaxy
Nothing here but abandoned machines
Magnified with only my two feet now
I loot the nearest All Night Pharmacy

And now I can hear the crying bloodless butcher
Carving his prayers out of the night
And now I can feel the falling bashful boxer
Forever born to lose the fight

With our small chances
Small chances
Like the tall branches
I see our small chances

Good luck - I'm always on the fence now
Soon enough it won't matter where I climb to
As the world is undergoing demolition
At the dump is where I'm going to find you

And now I can hear the crying bloodless butcher
Carving his prayers out of the night
And now I can feel the falling bashful boxer
Forever born to lose the fight

With our small chances
Small chances
Like the tall branches
I see our small chances

With every pill I'm gaining back my clarity
But I will need every single All Night Pharmacy
Every single All Night Pharmacy
Every single All Night Pharmacy...
