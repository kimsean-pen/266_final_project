It'd be a shame if I drowned in the house that I grew up in
I was practicing my swimming when the drugs went two kick in
So when I'm over at your house, I would pick through the lost and found
'Cause you got something I want and it's just begging to keep me around

I'm so sorry to hear that you're going
But you'll be happier now that you're glowing
You'll be glowing, yeah you'll glow
And the night won't be accepting my return

So when I'm over at your house
I would pick through my looming doubts
Because I guess I just wanted us together one last time
Before I go way down
I don't want to save you from anyone but yourself

Hold me down I don't want to save you
From these bad dreams that you're 'bout to be having
And you're glowing
You'll be glowing
Yeah you're glowing
Glowing
Glow
Glowing
And the night won't be accepting my return
