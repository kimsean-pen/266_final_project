Some girls feel best in their tiny dresses
Some girls, nothin' but sweatpants, lookin' like a princess
Some girls kiss new lips every single night
They're stayin' out late 'cause they just celebratin' life

You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
But it's okay if you want to change the body that you came in
'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
We're all just playin' a game in a way, tryin' to win that life

Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
Most girls work hard, go far, we are unstoppable
Most girls, our fight to make every day
No two are the same

I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls

I wanna be like, I wanna be like
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
I wanna be like, I wanna be like

Some girls like to keep their physique real private
Some girls wear jeans so tight 'cause it feels so right, yeah
Some girls, every day searchin', keep the page turnin'
Sleepin' in late 'cause they're just celebratin' life

You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
But it's okay if you want to change the body that you came in
'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
We're all just playin' a game in a way, tryin' to win that life

Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
Most girls work hard, go far, we are unstoppable
Most girls, our fight to make every day
No two are the same

I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls

I wanna be like, I wanna be like
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
I wanna be like, I wanna be like

Most girls (yeah)
Most girls (wanna be, wanna be, wanna be)
Most girls, our fight to make every day
No two are the same
I wanna be like most girls

I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
I wanna be like
