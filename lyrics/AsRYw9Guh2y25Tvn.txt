Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Calling all demons, this is the season
Next stop is therapy
We're the retarded and the brokenhearted
The season of misery

Here's to the wasted, I can almost taste it
The rejects and waste of times
Gonna take it further, get away with murder
And no one here is getting out alive

Here's to all God's losers, ra da da da de
The bottom-feeder's frenzy
Here's to all bloodsuckers sing along with me
'Cause we don't say no
Scream one, two, three

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We're too old to be misbehaved
We sold our souls and so ashamed of ourselves

So we wait for miss judgment day
Write me a letter and send it to my grave, yeah
All fucked up beyond intervention
Fuck the world this is my revolution

Long lost souls and livin' in cages
I'm on a bender, it's one for the ages
I've got the urge
To binge and surge

The tables turn
To crash and burn
Juliana homicide
Make my demons come to life

Julianna homicide
Won't you be my blushing bride
Chop me a line of my best friend's ashes
Dust to dust when the red light flashes

What the fuck does "OK" stand for
When the afterlife is nothing worth dying for?
I've got the urge
To binge and surge

The tables turn
To crash and burn
Juliana homicide
Make my demons come to life

Julianna homicide
Won't you be my blushing bride
Alright
Well California's burning to the ground
And Julianna walks on holy ground

Where there's smoke there's fire burning out the lights
'Cause California's burning down tonight
Tonight

Calling all demons, this is the season
Next stop is therapy
We're the retarded and the brokenhearted
The season of misery

Here's to the wasted, I can almost taste it
The rejects and waste of times
Gonna take it further, get away with murder
And no one here is getting out alive

Here's to all God's losers, ra da da da de
The bottom-feeder's frenzy
Here's to all bloodsuckers sing along with me
'Cause we don't say no
Scream one, two, three

We're carried away
Carried away
Carried away

We're carried away
Carried away
Carried away

We're carried away
Carried away
Carried away

We're carried away
Carried away
Carried away

We're carried away
Carried away
Carried away

We're carried away
Carried away
Carried away
