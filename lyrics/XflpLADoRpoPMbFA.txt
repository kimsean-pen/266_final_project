There's a story in your voice
and in the way you say goodnight
leaves me wanting more
that lingers in my mind
lingers in my mind
it was the golden age
of being lost in love

your wrote the perfect page
then you ripped it up
you ripped it up

Now I'm waiting for a train
from new york to boston]
it's not supposed to be this way
it's not supposed to be this way
it's the price i have to pay
throw roses at the rich girls

I start to feel ok
when is start to feel ok

There's a song inside my head
that plays on constantly
loud enough to wake the dead
its a song for you and me
its a song for you and me
those were the sleepless nights
learning to make love
an all sunken arms
being too far apart, too far gone

Now I'm waiting for a train
from New York to Boston
its not supposed to be this way
its not supposed to be this way
throwing roses at the rich girls
that's the price I have to pay

when I start to feel ok
I start to feel ok
I start to feel ok
That's the price I have to pay
