I remember you that night
Standing in the rain
Your black stare
Your black eyes
I remember what you said
Before I turned away
My heart died
Your sweetest lies

And if I saw you bleed
I'd stay here till the end
But you can't change for me

And I, And I, know you'll
never understand me
No matter how hard we try
And I, And I, know I'll never understand you
And your mechanical love

I still hear you in my sleep
Your running through my veins
Your whispers, your machine
We knew it was meant to be
But never meant to last
I'm sorry, you always knew

And if I saw you bleed
I'd stay here till the end
But you can't change for me

[Chorus x3:]
And I, And I, know you'll
never understand me
No matter how hard we try
And I, And I, know I'll never understand you
And your mechanical love
