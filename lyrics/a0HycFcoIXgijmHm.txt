I've been knocking so, come to your front door

headlight disco keep your eyes on the road, headlight disco

I've full throttled, my tank's filled to the top (filled to the top)
red and blue in view
I ain't gonna stop (ain't gonna stop)
give me a green light

don't be shy girl, the night is oh so young

I'm gonna make you come a
oh oh oh oh to the headlight disco
oh oh oh oh to the headlight disco

are all in tune
atop the cars
a disco ball
when a headlights move
we're gonna dance
till we see the sun

oh oh oh oh to a headlight disco
oh oh oh oh to a headlight disco
oh oh oh oh to a headlight disco
oh oh oh oh to a headlight disco

headlight disco keep your eyes on the road headlight disco
headlight disco keep your eyes on the road headlight disco
