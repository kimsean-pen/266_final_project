All I need is you
Ooooh
All I need is you
To keep in my time zone

When my mind's gone
And I'm flyin home

And I'm stressed out

And I'm tempted to get that Styrofoam
And go pour it up

But you know what's up
And you know it ain't goin solve nothin

I mean Lord forbid I might fall into something

And I'm all or nothin cuz
(All I need is you)
To hold me down like bed straps in a psych ward

It's killin' me but you still with me when I fight hard and
(All I need is)
You diggin' me when I'm igging you

Get with me when my car's pulled
Coulda dealt with me but you fell for me before I fell for you
(All I need is you)

To keep my on that right path and the right math

Cuz you plus nothing is everything
You're my everything
(All I need is)
Ain't gotta question my allegiance

Cuz the way you love me I could never leave you
I need you
(All I need is you)
By my side
Thick and thin
Highs and lows

Don't let go

(All I need is)
We goin ride
We goin win
Don't know how
All I know
You, all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed
You, all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed
(All I need is you)
Uh, how did I fall in this
No condition that I mention but you're all for this
Unconditional love I swear I sell it all for this
Tryna keep it together forgive my awkwardness
But uh, often it's just you and me off in this
Valley of shadows and I know they're tryna pick off in this
But all I need is you
It's funny just how off I get when I ain't riding with you
No adjectives for your awesomeness
Uh, they burning one for that burn out
This life it got them all turnt out
Took time now to put time in
So I turn to you when I'm worn out
(All I need is you)
You slow me down cuz you know me now
With my phony smile and I'm acting like it's all copacetic
It's so pathetic so juvenile
(You know what you do)
You keep me cool in the summer
When they be dressing less and I be wanna show off a stunt
There ain't nothin I want
You give me all that I need
All I need is you to keep that fire burning from me
All I need is you
By my side
Thick and thin
Highs and lows
Don't let go
(All I need is)
We goin ride
We goin win
Don't know how
All I know
(All I need is)
You, all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed
(All I need is)
You, all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed
Ain't nobody goin get in the way
Put that all my money in the bank
Cuz you do what them mothers can't
And I love that, yeah
We goin ride til the rims fall off
Above it all we can never fall, yeah
Hold my hand we can have it all
Hold my hand we can have it all
(All I need is you)
By my side
Thick and thin
Highs and lows
Don't let go
(All I need is)
We goin ride
We goin win
Don't know how
All I know
(All I need is)
You, all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed
You, all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed
You always fill me up when I'm feeling down
You always make it better for me somehow
All I need is you, whoa oh
All I need is you, whoa oh
(All I need is you)
