Show me what I'm searching for tonight
Searching once again for all I've missed indebted to me from this life
Become content with all I'll never have
Fall into me, show me what I'm missing
Tap into me, set my soul ablaze

Here you found me waiting, over time I've given up
Show me what I lost

Show me all I'm mourning for today
Yearning for all you have to give
Here I feel the sun upon my face
I was so cold, I was gone
You fell into me, showed me what I'm missing
Tap into me, set my soul ablaze

Here you found me waiting, over time I've given up
Show me what I lost
Never overstay your welcome place inside my head
Show me

Here you found me waiting, find me waiting
I'd given up, you show me what I lost
Show me what I lost
