I left my heart at home, or somewhere, I don't know.
Fed it to the lions in some act of violence.
I'm feeling vague and I can't seem to concentrate on things that matter most; I'm slipping into the unknown.
I'm no more.
I'm not around to hold your hand.
We're strangers, and I'm sorry.
The night turns into the day, but the sun eludes me.
I don't think I'm supposed to be happy here.
So I run away from this, from myself.
I drift with the wind; the sound of swaying trees helps me to fall asleep.
