You're sneaky from the corner of my eye
I saw you eying me, I know that you're watching
Tell me what would you do if I encouraged you
To get next to me when nobody's watching

The way your body keeps moving
Is something that makes me weak
Let's start our own little secrets
For just you and me to keep
Too late to come or shy now
You've already gone this far
So baby make your move, take charge
Show me what you got for me

Oh no

Is that your hands
(Your hands)
Rubbing on me
Oh no

Then tell me what you got for me

Baby, I can tell that you want to do more
Than just dance with me and I don't mind you flirting
But honestly do you really wanna spend the whole night
Passing looks at me
(Looks at me)
Come over here and get to working
