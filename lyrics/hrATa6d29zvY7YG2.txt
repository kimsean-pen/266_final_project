Caught in a cold sweat stuck splitting hairs
I'm drinking too much
I'm on my way to striking out

Go to sleep with the pressure of everyone
Watching, waiting, they're yours for the taking
But I still have my doubts

Before you ask which way to go
Remember where you've been

Stay awake, get a grip and get out
You're safe from the weight of the world
Just take a second to set things straight

I'll be fine even though I'm not always right
I can count on the sun to shine
Dedication takes a lifetime
But dreams only last for a night

Figure it out boy, you're tripping
So pull yourself together
Or you'll wash up like the rest

This ship is sinking, I'm thinking I'm done for
I watch as the sails disappear underwater
'Cause I'm no captain yet

I said, "Before you ask which way to go
Remember where you've been"

Stay awake, get a grip and get out
You're safe from the weight of the world
Just take a second to set things straight

I'll be fine, even though I'm not always right
I can count on the sun to shine
Dedication takes a lifetime
But dreams only last for a night

Believe you me, I'll give them everything
I'd tell them anything to show them everything
Believe you me, I'll give them everything
I'd tell them anything to show them everything

'Cause you ain't the only ones who wanna live it up
You ain't the only ones
You ain't the only ones who wanna live it up
You ain't the only ones
You ain't the only ones who wanna live it up
You ain't the only ones
You ain't the only ones who wanna live it up
You ain't the only ones
Stay awake, get a grip and get out
You're safe from the weight of the world
Just take a second to set things straight
I'll be fine, even though I'm not always right
I can count on the sun to shine
Dedication takes a lifetime
But dreams only last for a night
