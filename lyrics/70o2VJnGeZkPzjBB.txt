She is benediction
She is addicted to thee
She is the root connection
She is connecting with me

Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me

I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music drags me in
Makes me come on like some heroin

She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on
He, who is chosen by she

Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me

I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music drags me in
Makes me come on like some heroin

She is re-creation
She, intoxicated by thee
She has the slow sensation that
He is levitating with she

Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
'til I lose my sense of gravity

I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music drags me in
Makes me come on like some heroin

Oh, God I feel for you
Oh, God I feel for you
Oh, God I feel for you
Oh, God I feel for you
Oh, God I feel for you
Oh, God I feel for you
Oh, God I feel for you
Oh, God I feel for you
Oh, God I feel for you
Oh, God I feel for you
Oh, God I feel for you
Oh, God I feel for you
