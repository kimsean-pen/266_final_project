She was brought into this world
Out of a beautiful mistake
When her mom was just a girl
And her daddy didn't stay

She was working at age 9
At the flower shop in town
Working not just to survive
'Cause life was throwing her around

In the rose garden
Where the rain is falling
And the thorns are sharpened
Rose garden, yeah, rose garden

She was young but not naive
Always wise beyond her years
Hoping that no one would see
Every time she dried her tears

In the rose garden
Where the rain is falling
And the thorns are sharpened
Rose garden, yeah, rose

Don't let those petals fall
Don't let them fall on you
Don't let those petals fall
Don't let them fall on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, in the rose garden
Where the rain is falling
And the thorns are sharpened
Rose garden, yeah

In the rose garden
(Rose garden, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Rose garden, yeah)
Rose
(Rose garden, yeah)
Rose
