i wake up in a town that never sleeps
love has taken me
my words get lost in the morning heat
i never admit defeat
and it turns off and goes again
my faith won't give in
the sun can't burn away our sins
don't forgive me
my words get lost in the moment of things
love has taken me
i stand up to the shadow that never leaves
i never admit defeat
and it turns off and goes again
my tears won't give in
the sun can't burn away our sins
don't forgive me
