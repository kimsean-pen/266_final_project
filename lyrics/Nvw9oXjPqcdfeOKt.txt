I'm limited
Just look at me
I'm limited
And just look at you
You can do all I couldn't do, Glinda
So now it's up to you
For both of us
Now it's up to you

I've heard it said
That people come into our lives
For a reason
Bringing something we must learn
And we are led
To those who help us most to grow
If we let them
And we help them in return
Well, I don't know if I believe that's true
But I know I'm who I am today
Because I knew you

Like a comet pulled from orbit
As it passes a sun
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Halfway through the wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
But because I knew you
I have been changed for good

It well may be
That we will never meet again
In this lifetime
So let me say before we part
So much of me
Is made of what I learned from you
You'll be with me
Like a handprint on my heart
And now whatever way our stories end
I know you have re-written mine
By being my friend

Like a ship blown from its mooring
By a wind off the sea
Like a seed dropped by a skybird
In a distant wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
But because I knew you

Because I knew you

I have been changed for good

And just to clear the air
I ask forgiveness
For the things I've done
You blame me for

But then, I guess
We know there's blame to share

And none of it seems to matter anymore

Like a comet pulled from orbit
Like a ship blown from its mooring
As it passes a sun
By a wind off the sea
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Like a seed dropped by a bird
Halfway through the wood
In the wood

Who can say
If I've been changed for the better?
I do believe I have been changed for the better

And because I knew you

Because I knew you

Because I knew you
I have been changed
For good
