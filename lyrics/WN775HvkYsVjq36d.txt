If you're fond of sand dunes and salty air
Quaint little villages here and there
(You're sure) You're sure to fall in love with old Cape Cod
(Old Cape Cod, that old Cape Cod)

If you like the taste of lobster stew
Served by a window with an ocean view
(You're sure) You're sure to fall in love with old Cape Cod

Winding roads that seem to beckon you
Miles of green beneath skies of blue
Church bells chimin' on a Sunday morn'
Remind you of the town where you were born

If you spend an evening you'll want to stay
Watching the moonlight on Cape Cod Bay
You're sure to fall in love with old Cape Cod
(Aah-aah)

If you spend an evening you'll want to stay (on Cape Cod Bay)
Watching the moonlight on Cape Cod Bay
You're sure to fall in love with ol' Cape Cod
You're sure to fall in love, you're sure to fall in love with ol' Cape Cod
