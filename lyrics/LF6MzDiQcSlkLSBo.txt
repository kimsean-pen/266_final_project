Come on baby, show me your favorite
I'm as addicted as your lips to your cigarette
I'm a lover of a second degree (And a killer)
My Mona Lisa wasn't looking at me
To adore you
Alright

All in favor, take the stand and defend me
I'm so cold and lonely
I could be dead
But I'm doing alright!

Mmm

I know what you want
But it's not gonna be what you like
I know what you want
But it's not gonna be what you like

Cleaning my hands out my bloody fingers
My brain is scattered like the thoughts in my pattern
I'm a lover of a second degree (And a killer)
My Mona Lisa wasn't looking at me
C'mon!

I know what you want
But it's not gonna be what you like
I know what you want
But it's not gonna be what you like

Throw some salt over your shoulder baby!

I've got a new love
Forward put me back
I've got a new low
It's all right, put me back
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo (Oh, I really hate, I really hate us)

Well I was thinking of it
Well, I just thought I'd mention

I know what you want
But it's not gonna be what you like
I know what you want
But it's not gonna be what you like
