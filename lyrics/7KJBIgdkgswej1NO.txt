Have you seen me? I am your lover-to-be
You might run into the street
You look back for one more peek
It's okay by me, it's okay by me
It's okay by me, it's okay by me

Oh, I am your lover-to-be
Never before, never again
Will you see such a special man
All peachy-keen, all peachy-keen
All peachy-keen, all peachy-keen, oh

You can trust me, I am your lover-to-be
You act afraid and nervously coy
Because I'm someone you might enjoy, oh
That's me, that's me, that's me, oh
Ayy, ayy, oh, oh

I am your lover-to-be
You say, "God, spare me this corruptor"
God says, "You don't know how lucky you are"
The Pentagon knows, the Pentagon knows
The Pentagon knows, the Pentagon knows
I have nothing to say, I am your lover-to-be
Might not be Thursday, it might not be Friday
But soon, I'll have you my way

A good Italian stock, mmm, lover-to-be
The way you girlishly, boyishly hide
There's not very much to describe
Oh, oh, oh, I have nothing to say, I am
What is money compared to love?
It's as Godless, sexless, stupid innocent question
Finally, finally
Oh, finally, I am your lover-to-be
I have trashed all the boozes in town
And it's your turn now
