No man no cry

I'm so sick about it
So wrong but I dont know what to do without it
My love, my time, my all invested in you so much
I thought I never doubt it
Now it hurts so bad I wanna scream and shout it
Tell me what happened to the man
That promised the world and said

You said that you would be there
Now it seems like you just dont care
And I'm not going to take it anymore

All of the years that I gave
All of these tears that I waste
I think it's time that I get on with my life
Although I might be alone (Although I might be)
I'm better on my own
Without you here Im doing more than just fine
No man no cry

Feels good starting over
Me myself and I through and through I thought I told ya
My independence day i found me a brand new life
And though my heart is aching
I get a little stronger with each baby step I'm taking
Looking back on what I left
I know what I'm doing is right

You said that you would be there
Now it seems like you just don't care (You don't care)
And I'm not going to take it anymore

All of the years that I gave
All of these tears that I waste (Tears that I waste)
I think it's time that I get on with my life (It's time, gotta get on with my life)
Although I might be alone (Alone)
I'm better on my own (I'm better)
Without you here I'm doing more than just fine (More than just fine)
No man no cry

Looka here see my eyes are dry
No tears when I said goodbye
You know better than to ask me why (Don't even try)
Cause im gone, so gone
Pack your bags boy it's time to carry on
I'm taking back all that's mine

All of the years that I gave (All of the years that I gave yeah yeah yeah)
All of these tears that I waste
I think it's time that I get on with my life (I got to get through with my life)
Although I might be alone (Hey)
I'm better on my own (You know I'm better baby)
Without you here I'm doing more than just fine (No man no cry)

All of the years that i gave
All of these tears that I waste
I think it's time that I get on with my life (It's time, I get on with my life)
Although I might be alone (I might be alone)
I'm better on my own (You know I'm better)
Without you here im doing more than just fine
No man no cry (No man no cry)

No cry
No man
