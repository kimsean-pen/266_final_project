See the color of the rain overwhelms your cover
Gentle giant laid to rest as the night surrendered
Tiny whistles of the trees they tried to tell me something
Darkest shades of the leaves tell me what you're hiding

And all the things that we've built shan't be brought along
And all the things that we've lost shall be turned to songs

Subtle whispers from the sea, reveal a certain story
Restless lions in the caves, tell me what your worries
Flying birds among the clouds, show me the direction
Little pebbles on the ground forming an abstraction

And all the things that we've built shan't be brought along
And all the things that we've lost shall be turned to songs

A dying man holding his brother begging for the sun
A worried child losing her mother begging for the sun
A tired prey running from the hunter begging for the sun
A weary hand chained and locked to another begging for the sun
