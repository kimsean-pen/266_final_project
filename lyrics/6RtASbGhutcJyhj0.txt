Imagery
We never come to see is blind
Far outside
The covers we hide behind
Daylight
Turning into deep night
Insight
Forever you know
Never never comes
Never never comes
Never never comes
Never never comes
Somewhere far
We used to be we are and proud
Visions we can
Never come to see are loud
Daylight
Turning into deep night
Insight
Forever you know
Never never comes
Never never comes
Never never comes
Never never comes
Never never comes
Never never comes
Never never comes
Never never comes
