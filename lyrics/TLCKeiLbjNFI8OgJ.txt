You know he's gotta get away
To the merry-go-round and round
Count the times that he laid awake at night thinkin'
Am I going down now?
Am I going down?
Am I going down now? Ooh

It's not easy putting on a smile
You're alone, lost and found
She waits home alone just to love him through the night, thinking
He's been gone so long now
Is he coming home?
He's been gone so long now, ooh

Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round

Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round

Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round

You know he's gotta get away
To the merry-go-round and round
Count the times that he laid awake at night thinking
Am I going down now?
Am I going down?
Am I going down now? Ooh

Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round

Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round

Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round

Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round

Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round
Merry-go-round and round

Waits home alone
Just to love him through the night
I'm coming home babe
