Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't live for tomorrow
Tomorrow's much too long
I'll burn my eyes out
Before I get out
I wanted more

Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face
Today is the greatest

Day I've ever known
Can't wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I'll tear my heart out
Before I get out

Today is the greatest
Today is the greatest day
Today is the greatest day
That I have ever known
