We're dancing on top of the world
Looking down on places
That cease to exist
We need a reason to turn our backs
Forced to create steel towers of death
We're fearless on the edge of the earth
Giving all these people
A chance to persist
We need a reason to turn our backs
Building a future with so many cracks

Remember where you first called home
Reclaim the life of the skydancer
Restore what you called your own
Return where you run wild and free

Remember where you first called home
You're never gonna see it
Till you're dancing on top of the world
Restore what you called your own
Return where you run wild and free

There's dying in the streets
The hungry cannot eat
The rich fuel the genocide

Every angle
Bound by the concrete jungle
Unconscious
Can we afford to live this way?

Abandoned and forsaken
Is this the path that we've taken?
Abandoned and forsaken
We must arise and awaken

Eeeagh

Remember where you first called home
(Where you first called home)
Restore what you called your own
Return
Remember where you first called home
Reclaim the life of the skydance
Restore what you called your own
Return where you run wild and free

Remember where you first called home
You're never gonna see it
Till you're dancing on top of the world
Restore what you called your own
Return where you run wild and free

Remember where you first called home
You're never gonna see it
Till you're dancing on top of the world
Restore what you called your own
Return
(Return)

We're dancing on top of the world
Looking down on places
That cease to exist
We need a reason to turn our backs
Forced to create steel towers of death
We're fearless on the edge of the earth
Giving all these people
A chance to persist
We need a reason to turn our backs
Building a future with so many cracks
