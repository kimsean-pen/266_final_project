You look at me with a doubt in your eyes
We're back again
Now it's time to focus
I'm gonna get you broken
It's not that I don't want you
Baby you're a dime but
We don't have to rush
You need to know

You're one step forward
So take one step back for me
You're one step forward
Don't push it, it won't make it real, no
One step forward
Take one step back for me
Can we slow down, you're forward

I can't wait you're only gonna lose, lose
What you don't have, what you could have
You, but I'm tied up, shit, we're tied up

Morning light, got your hands on my thighs
I pull you in
Wanna feel you closer
Remember when I told ya
I haven't been around like you
I never needed anybody near
They come and go

You're one step forward
So take one step back for me
You're one step forward
So don't push it, it won't make it real, no
You're one step forward
Take one step back for me
Can we slow down, you're forward

I can't wait you're only gonna lose, lose
What you don't have, what you could have
You, but I'm tied up, shit, we're tied up

Say I'm selfish
But I can't help if I'm not
What you want me to be now
Really wish that I could feel now
Selfish, I'm gonna leave it up to you
Should we tie it up?
Should we stop?

I can't wait you're only gonna lose, lose
What you don't have, what you could have
Baby, don't you know?
You, but I'm tied up, shit, we're tied up

But I'm tied up
Shit, we're tied up, baby
But I'm tied up
Shit, we're tied up
