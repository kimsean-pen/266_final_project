I don't know where we're going from here
but it's time to sing the saddest song
Looking alive with a broken mind,
why don't you ever take my side
We can dream of all the mistakes that we've made
There's no reason, there's nothing left to take away
I now know where we're going from here
and it's time to sing a happy song
Feeling alive with a throbbing mind,
you're never gonna break my stand
We can dream of all the mistakes that we've made
There's no reason, we can't start at the end
We're users but at least we use each other friend
We'll choose our path and face the consequence
Some say love, I say fight
I hope I'm not wrong
A restless soul, a wicked mind
I'd rather kiss the ground than kiss a starless sky
