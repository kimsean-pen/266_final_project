I've been out
I've been down
I've been kicked down to the ground
By the voices in my head

But you said
Life gets tough when you get older
That's why I raised a soldier
Fight this battle 'til the end

I've been out
I've been down
I've been kicked down to the ground
By the voices in my head

I've been out
I've been down
I've been kicked down to the ground
By the voices in my head

But you said
Life gets tough when you get older
That's why I raised a soldier
Fight this battle 'til the end

Life gets tough when you get older
That's why I raised a soldier
Fight this battle 'til the end

Life gets tough when you get older
That's why I raised a soldier
Fight this battle 'til the end
