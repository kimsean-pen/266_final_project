Wait in silence
Until the stars go dark
My companion
With your cracked, withered heart

That day is coming
I know that you're calling on me
That day is coming
I know that you're calling on me
I don't want you to make me wait too long
It's time to get on the road

Half dead colours
Residues of my soul
Caught by the wind
Hunting
Thirsty for love

That day is coming
I know that you're calling on me
That day is coming
I know that you're calling on me
I don't want you to make me wait too long
It's time to get on the road
