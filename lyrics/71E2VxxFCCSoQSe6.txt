I put a brave
Brave face on
In a strange place
Don't be long
The air was thin
The show was fast
We follow faith
No other there
I put a brave face on
Up in a strange place but

Can you hear the voices
Can you hear those voices
Can you hear those voices
Can you hear those voices
Can you hear those voices

I put a brave face on
Up in a strange place oh
All the faces were unknown
I was the only one
It's days like these
I have to get upon my knees
And ask God to see me
'Cause these souls ain't clean

Can you hear those voices
Can you hear those voices
Can you hear those voices
Can you hear those voices

The voices
The voices
The voices
The voices
The voices
The voices
The voices
The voices

Try to keep my faith oh
Gotta stay strong
I put a brave face on
I put my brave face on
I put my brave face on
I put my brave face on
I put my brave face on
I put my brave face on
