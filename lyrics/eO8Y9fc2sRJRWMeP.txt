Stirring at water's edge,
Cold froth on my twig,
My mind in whirls
Wanders around desire

May I, can I, or have I too often
Craved miracles?
May I, can I, or have I too often now
Craved miracles?
I'm craving miracles

No one imagines the light shock I need,
And I'll never know
From who's hands, deeply humble,
Dangerous gifts as such to mine come.

May I, should I, or have I too often...?
I'm craving miracles
May I, can I, or have I too often?
Craving miracles...
Craving miracles.

My romantic gene is dominant
And it hungers for union,
Universal intimacy,
All embracing

May I, have I or have I too often
Craved miracles?
Can I, should I or have I too often...?
Craving miracles
Craving...
Crave...

Waves irregularly striking,
Wind stern in my face
Thunderstorm, come,
Scrape those barnacles off me!

May I, should I or have I too often
Craved miracles?
May I, can I or have I too often...?
Craving miracles

All my body parts are one
As lightning hits my spine,
Sparkling
Prime runs through me,
Revive my wish
I am inviolable!

May I, should I, or have I too often...?
I'm craving miracles
May I, should I or have I too often now...?
Craving miracles
I'm craving miracles
Craving miracles

Crave
