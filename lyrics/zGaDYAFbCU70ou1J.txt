I wish we were stuck up a tree,
Then we'd know it's nicer below.

I don't know any lullabys,
I don't know how to make you mine, but I can learn.
In lonely days long ago, I saw lovers put on a show,
Well, now it's my turn.

Drive you home, and then wait by the phone for that call,
For a walk in the fall.

No harm will come of this,
One little midnight kiss, it will not burn.
For many lonely days, I feel like a throw-away,
Well, now it's my turn.

Falling down is no longer around.
Feeling sun, I'm no longer one.
Well, isn't this fun?
