It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
How will this all play out
Of sight, out of mind now
By now we should know how to communicate
Instead of coming to blows, We're on a roll
And there ain't no stopping us now
We're burning under control
Isn't it strange how we're all
Burning under the same sun?
Buy now and save, it's a war for peace
It's the same old game
But do we really want to play?
We could close our eyes it's still there
We could say it's us agaisnt them
We could try but nobody wins
Gravity has got al hold on us all
We could try to put it out
But it's a glowing flame
Using fear as fuel
Burning down our name
And it won't take too long
Words all burn the same
And who are we going to blame now?
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame (rp 3x)
But now it's beginning to show
A number of people are numbers that ain't coming home
I could close my eyes it's still there
Close my mind be alone
I could close my heart and not care
But gravity has got a hold on us all
It's a terrific price to pay
But in the true sense of the word
Are we using what we've learned?
In the true sense of the word
Are we losing what we were?
It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
It's not for me to say
Is it in our blood
Or is just our fate?
And how will this all play out
Upside out of my mouth
Who are we going to blame all in all?
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame (rp 3x)
