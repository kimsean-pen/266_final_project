Although the trees ungentle sway
Reflect the temper of the day
Just as lovely as you say
Rain upon my hair is falling
Stirred up as the river flows
The clammer of the bar below
Strings a man, his sentence slow
"The cuckoo is a-callin"
Now

I know this bitter life may feel
Ungentle & at times unkind
It bares within itself the fear
Of being someone else its fine but
You my lovely friend have nothing
But a spine, but a spine
You'll surely take those jabs they throw & drink them like red wine
You swine
