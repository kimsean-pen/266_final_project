Tenderly
Tenderly
Please take my breath from me
Into the fountain
And up from the graves

Tearfully
Joyfully
Burn what is left of me
I don't want these burdens
I've handsomely gained (?)

You'll be my guest
And i'll let you stay
Leave me the check
I'll pay with the rest of my life
Twist the knife

Carefully
Quietly
You took what's young from me
I didn't deserve it
I gave it away

Cowardly
Thoughtlessly
You walk away from me
And I'll tear my heart out to save you the day

You'll be my guest
And i'll let you stay
Leave me the check
I'll pay with the rest of my life
Twist the knife

Tenderly
Tenderly
Please take my breath from me
Into the fountain
And up from the graves
