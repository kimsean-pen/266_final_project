Have you seen me in the magazine?
Huh?
Have you seen me?

Beep, beep, my Jeep clean, the reems stink
Bling, bling, my ring fing, cha-ching-ching
Ice cold, the links clink, my chain blinks
Drip, drop, diamonds copped, hair-ween-steen
Tic toc, my wrist watch is so hot
Black ice, I'm so nice, I'm pish posh
Block's hot but still rock a tall sock
Low boot, a bra top, a big Glock (ha)
I'm a music man
I'm a what? I'm a what?
I'm a muse! I'm a man!
I like to wear a skirt
I'm a flirt, you're a fan
Whistle, I'll, I werk
Pop and twerk
Instagram
Damn, what's the plan?
I need it like I'm feigning
Where's da grams?
No, no
Where da caine?
I'm in here sniffing and I'm feigning for the fame, mane!
