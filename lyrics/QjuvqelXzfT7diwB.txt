It's a green-striped sheet
Lifted from me I am free
Of two very heavy bodies

Once we three
Had slept soundly
I couldn't keep them around
Fold the blankets down and
Found new sleeping ground-
Bed-springs squeaking
Tires squealing away
From one another
We all used to be lovers here

Bodies laying say they'll stay
Like boxes stacked
The same way
Labeled and separated

Go ahead
Take the couch
I know I don't wanna sit here
Go ahead
Take the fridge
I know I don't want you going hungry
Go ahead
Take the cat
I know you're only gonna be coming back so
Go ahead
Take it all
I know you've been wanting to
Settle down

One on the left says
To the one on the right
I could make a very good wife for you

One on the right says
To the one on the left
Let's take this one step at a time

One on the right says
To the one on the left you know
I need you all the time

One on the left says
To the one on the right
I think I changed my mind
And my insides sing

A song for the sad ones
Who say they'll marry
They guess
If she's wearing a white dress
If he behaves his very best
Yes
