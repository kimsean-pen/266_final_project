I'm fixing a drink in the morning
With the way things are
You may have stayed too long

It's splitting apart at the seams
From the hospital call
You've known him so long, oh

If there's a God up in the air
Someone looking over everyone
At least you've got something to fall back on

Deep in the heart of the country
Was a house I built from logs
A raven and a lady hawk

Quiet and calm through the day
See the sun burn through the fog
Approaching was a yellow dog, oh

If there's a god up in the air
Someone looking over everyone
At least you've got something to fall back on

And what are people reeling from
Does anybody even care?
I bet you get a lot of compliments down there
If there's a god up in the air
Someone looking over everyone
At least you've got something to fall back on
Do you got something to say
Is there something coming over you?
Do you got important things still left to do?
