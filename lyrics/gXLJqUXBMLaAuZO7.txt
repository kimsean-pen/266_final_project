With you Seesaw - up and down
I'm on a seesaw - up and down
Up and down with you
Seesaw - up and down
I'm on a seesaw - up and down
Up and down with you

I see pictures in my mind
I feel fingers up my spine
I saw my heart break in two
I saw her walking with you
With you

Seesaw - up and down
I'm on a seesaw - up and down
Up and down with you
With you I can see it in your eyes
I see through your thin disguise
She was always my best friend
I saw you and her again

I see pictures in my mind
I feel fingers up my spine
I saw my heart break in two
I saw her walking with you

With you.
