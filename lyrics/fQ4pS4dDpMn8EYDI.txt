I see the, I see the
I see the, I see the
I see the rain pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise
I see the, I see the rain
Pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise

I'm searching and praying and hoping for something
I know I'm gon' see it
I know that it's coming Lord
Lord
But what do you do when there's no place to turn
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down Lord
Lord

The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide, got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high, ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know
I don't know
The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide, got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high, ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know
I don't know

Bells gettin' louder, louder

I see the rain pouring down
