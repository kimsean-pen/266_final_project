There was a time
I used to call ya all my very ow__n.
We were so happy woman,
Talkin' for hours an' hours on the telephone.
An' then one day
I said you up'd and walked-a righta outa my life,
Leavin' me all by myself,
All alone to cry every night.

Babe, babe, babe
Whoah,
Come on home.
I want you to come back home yeah.
Ohhh yeah.
Sweet little girl ahh,
You been gone too long.
You been away so long

Now listen to me.

I said I made up my mind,
A-woman when you left me there oh.
I was gonna find another sweet lover
A-gonna feel all-a-my, all-a-my, all-a-my care.
So I met a sweet little girl,
Just about as nice as she could be ahh.
I fell in love with that woman
But she turned around and did the same
thing again to me ohh~ohh.

Babe, Oh! babe, babe
Baby, baby
Come on home.
Please come home ho__ yeah, it's alright.

I know
You been gone too long.
You been away so long.

Babe, babe, babe
I want you to please
Come on home.
Come home ohh.
Ohhh yeah.
You been gone too long.

So I made up my mind:
I'm gonna crawl right back to you woman,
I'm gonna plead and plead and plead yeah,
'Til you're here by my side.
I can't even walk down the same
Old streets we used to walk down
'Cause I keep thinkin' 'bout all the good times.
Keep thinkin' 'bout it, I wanna make you mine.

Ohh babe,
Babe, babe, babe, babe babe
Please
Come on home. come home yeah.
Ohhh yeah.
You been gone too long.

I want you to ohh-ah,
Babe, babe, babe

Come on home.
Home to me woman.
Ohhh yeah.
I want you to sing about
when we walked through the trees together.
You been gone too long.
You know we had such a real good time.

Whoah, here they come!

Babe, babe, babe
I believe it's always callin'.
Can you feel the brown leaf against your face?
You oughta sing and shout and say
Ohhh yeah.
Baby, baby, baby
You been gone too long.
I want you to come home.
