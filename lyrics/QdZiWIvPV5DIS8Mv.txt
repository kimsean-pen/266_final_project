Information, the river we caress
Baptized in it's passing water
Scattered with partial clarity
Pollution leaves us ignorant

This machine is built for pigs
Abounded by bees, no enlightenment
Escaping the collapsing hive
Oppress, regress, become a drone

We're coal for the leaders to burn
Small suns light the engines of gold
Machines self sustained by deceit
The animal farm forever drones on

The animal farm drones on
