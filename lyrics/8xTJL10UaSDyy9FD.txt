I get alone without you very well
Of course, I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered
In your arms
Of course, I do
But I get alone without you very well

I've forgotten you
Just like I said I would
Of course, I have
Or maybe except when I hear your name
Someone's laugh that's just the same
I've forgotten you just like
I should

What a guy
What a fool am I
To think my aching hearth
Could keep the moon
What's in store
Should I phone once more
No, no, no, no, no
It's best that I stick to my tune

I said that I get alone
Without you very well
Of course, I do
Except perhaps in spring
But then I should never
Ever think of spring
For that would
Surely break my heart in two
