Ooh baby mm
When you hold me
Oh Oh
When you hold me the sound

Is it possible I could feel this
good I could really love you
the way I do
Is it possible I would feel this
good I could really love you
the way I do

See me (within the light)
Flowing (take me to you)
Like the river to the sea
You come down (im in the light)
You cover (pull me to you)
And the waves rush over me

I feel a love light rush over me
I feel the love turn to me
And then your love just
creeps over me
Over me

See me (within the light)
Flowing (take me to you)
Like the river to the sea
You come down (im in the light)
You cover (pull me to you)
And the waves rush over me

Ooh baby mm
When you hold me
Oh oh
When you hold me

And I wont let you go
I wont let you go
And I wont let you go
I wont let you go

Take up your love
Take up your love
Take up your love
And come to me
This love's not a liar
To cold its a fire
Im on the run
And its a comfort to me

Take up your love
Take up your love
Take up your love
And come to me
This loves not a liar
To cold its a fire
Im on the run
And its a comfort to me

And I wont let you go
I wont let you go
And I wont let you go
I wont let you go
