The way of the ocean
Touch my heart like fire
I cannot control you
You have deeper layers
You're alive and you're wild
When you're nearer to me
I lean forward to touch you
But you surprised me
When I lean against you
I will only fall through
Sometimes you seem to sleep
Then a storm's coming through
Through, fear the ocean's way
The way of the ocean
Touch my heart like fire
(Ocean's way)
I cannot control you
You have deeper layers
Ah, should I fear you?
Are you caught in anger?
(Fear the ocean's way)
Gods cannot control you
Winds make you go higher
If I swim to the ground
I will need to go up
You will turn me around
When the storm's coming through
When the morning dawns bright
I admire the silveriness inside you
I look into this mirror
I look into this mirror
Ocean's way
The way of the ocean
Touch my heart like fire
(Fear the ocean's way)
I cannot control you
You have deeper layers
Ah, should I fear you?
Are you caught in anger?
(Ocean's way)
Gods cannot control you
Winds make you go higher
You're alive and you're wild
When you're nearer to me
I lean forward to touch you
But you surprised me
If I swim to the ground
I will need to go up
You will turn me around
When the storm's coming through
When the storm's coming through
The way of the ocean
Touch my heart like fire
(Fear the ocean's way)
I cannot control you
You have deeper layers
The way of the ocean
(Fear the ocean's way)
It's the waves ruled by the winds
