Down to who knows who, just to socialize.
I'm waiting for my girls, when you caught my eyes.
You got no way to make a man honey
You got to understand.
I'm your man, child. Lord Of The Thighs.
Well, well, Lordie my God
What do we got here?
She's flashin' 'cross the floor
Make it perfectly clear.
You're the bait, and you're the Someone 'bound to take a look.
I'm your man, child. Lord Of The Thighs.
You must of come here to find it
You've got the look in your eyes.
Although you really don't mind it -
I am the Lord of your Thighs!
You must of come here to find it baby
You've got the look in your eyes.
Although you really don't mind it -
I am the Lord of your Thighs!
