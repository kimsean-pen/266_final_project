Didn't see it coming
No kind of warning
I can't work out what I've done wrong
His clothes are missing
But his keys are still here
Please somebody tell me whats going on
My baby's got a suitcase

He's telling me its too late
But don't tell nobody, please don't ask me why
'Cause all I did was love him
But I can't stop him walking
My baby's got a suitcase but please don't ask me why
What changed so quickly?
Answer me!

If you must kill me at least, please tell me why
He said "Don't touch me, Get out the way"
Will someone tell me what's going on tonight
My baby's got a suitcase
He's telling me its too late
But don't tell nobody, please don't ask me why

'Cause all I did was love him
But I can't stop him walking
My baby's got a suitcase but please don't ask me why
I can't stop my heart leaving through the door
I can't unpack my heart 'cause he won't look at me anymore
My baby's got a suitcase
He's telling me its too late

But don't tell nobody, please don't ask me why
'Cause all I did was love him
But I can't stop him walking
My baby's got a suitcase but please don't ask me why
