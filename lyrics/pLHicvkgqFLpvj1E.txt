Now it's your duty
To kill the newborn child
Fill the blood in the black shrine

Priest, priest, evil priest
Hear the words of hate
Priest, priest, child of Satan

Priest, priest, child of Satan
See the omens of death

Satan, holy Satan
Our souls belong to you
Take the black shrine
It's contains our present

Priest, priest, evil priest
Hear the words of hate
Priest, priest, child of Satan
See the omens of death

Open the Black Book
Meet me inside the church, into the strange
