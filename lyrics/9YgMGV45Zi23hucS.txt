It's close to midnight
And I'm leavin' now
I'm getting in my car
I'm headin' out

And I can't slow down
Cos I don't know how

You got my number
So we'll be fine
So go and use it
Just don't waste my time

Cos you're on my mind
And you know I'm right

[Bridge]
You take me over
Stay with me and
We'll fade away

[Chorus]
Look on the floor
And all are spinnin' round

Someone told me this
was just a dance
And take a chance
And I'll give you more
Do you really think
We have a chance

Devils in your eyes
And he's lookin' at me
I know what you want
And you know what I need

Come and show me how
How do you get down

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Repeat Chorus

Chance X 11
Do you really think we have a chance

[Chorus X2
