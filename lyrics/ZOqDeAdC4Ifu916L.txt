Find you in the dark
Read you like a cheap surprise
Oh, without shame
Sell me out and frame your name
I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly
Jealousy is the weapon you kill me
Keep a dime for a truth you might tell

You toed the line
And I know it was mine
Couldn't hide, write a wave, ride a lie
Let me know
Can I friend ask you why?

Rolling back the days
With my friend I love to play
The "little one"
Superman with silver gun
I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly
Jealousy is the weapon you kill me
Keep a dime for a truth you might tell

You toed the line
And I know it was mine
Couldn't hide, ride a wave, ride a lie
Let me know
Can I friend ask you why?

Wait for me
Take a dive take a piece of my life
(leave me numb)
Wait for me
Tell a lie, try to take my wife
(leave me numb)
Wait for me
Take a dive take a piece of my life
(leave me numb)
Close to me
And I'll leave you numb

You toed the line
And I know it was mine
Couldn't hide, ride a wave, ride a lie
Let me know
Can I friend ask you why?

You toed the line
And I know it was mine
Couldn't hide, ride a wave, ride a lie
Let me know
Can I friend ask you why?

You toed the line
And I know it was mine
Couldn't hide, ride a wave, ride a lie
Let me know
Can I friend ask you why?
Can I friend ask you why?
Can I friend ask you why?
