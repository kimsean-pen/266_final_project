i never knew life could be this way
life without you
i never knew life could be this strange
like a skylight is in blue
i know you're still here
i know you still care
i know you fall into pieces
only you and i would chain
i know you're my love
know that i always care
only have been with without you
my heart will always heal
never forget
and never look
always there in the shadow
i do believe
kiss you couldn't see
always there when it maters
i'm still here
i'm still here
i'm still here
i'm still here
i never meant life to feel this way
so much to sacrifice
i never thought life to pass away
and in such a high price
if we were still one
for love hasn't gone
i sense everything about you
around me when i'm alone
i know that you'll always be
deep in the heart of me
no matter where i'm today
you'll always be a part of me
i never forget
and never look
always there in the shadow
i do believe
kiss you couldn't see
always there when it maters
i'm still here
i'm still here
i'm still here
i'm still here
