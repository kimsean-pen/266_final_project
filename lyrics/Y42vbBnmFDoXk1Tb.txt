All over
Deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had something that never happened
If only we had less control

Both got the feeling
Hit like a rad day
Had boyfriends and girlfriends
We wanted to touch, but we could never make any moves
Both got the feeling
Guilty desire
Your body, my body
We were close, but still so far away

When the lights go out, when the lights go out
Will you be there?
When I lay you down, when I lay you down
Down in my bed
Tellin' right from wrong, tellin' right from wrong
All this self control is so emotional
Yeah, it's so emotional

All over
Deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had something that never happened
If only we had less control
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional

The car in the driveway
The questions in her mouth
This secret is risky
So we have to keep all these fantasies to ourselves
Clothes on the carpet
You're over at my house
I wish we could do it
We came so close, but still we push away

When the lights go out, when the lights go out
Will you be there?
When I lay you down, when I lay you down
Down in my bed
Tellin' right from wrong, tellin' right from wrong
All this self control is so emotional
Yeah, it's so emotional

All over
Deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had something that never happened
If only we had less control
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

When the lights go out, when the lights go out
Will you be there?
When I lay you down, when I lay you down
Down in my bed
Tellin' right from wrong, tellin' right from wrong
All this self control is so emotional
Yeah, it's so emotional

All over
Deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had something that never happened
If only we had less control
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
(You got me so emotional)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Yeah, it's so emotional
