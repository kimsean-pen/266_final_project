Light girl come walking through the cornfield
Light blue vibration through the sea
I know I'd love her to breathe, again
Light cubes are talking her down

I've been a wasted day
Light spinning round a saint
Light colored wild sign
Theresa talking in the rain

Light girl be growing through town
Windows are thoughts in the stain
I know I'd love her to stay
Whispering signs are agreeing

Light talking gold into rain
Light thriving dark into saint
A cat in gold goes alone
Theresa's sound for the king
