I don't know, turtleneck, where you've been all my life
But I feel, turtleneck, that you're leaving me aside

Look at me and let go of my ways
The fear inside that your fever has died

I don't know turtleneck where you've been all my life
But I feel, turtleneck, that you're leaving me aside
I don't know turtleneck where you've been all my life
But I feel, turtleneck, that you're leaving me aside

Crumbling and shattering his?
You yearn for more, a churn, looking for something new
You call the lover's name in your black sheep
You yearn for more, my turtleneck, for something new

I don't know turtleneck where you've been all my life
But I feel, turtleneck, that you're leaving me aside
I don't know turtleneck where you've been all my life
But I feel, turtleneck, that you're leaving me aside

Was he having fun enough? of her heart
Morning ...
Of all the city there? Drinks were in there
Running to approve?? were on the wall
And then she

She was a man in black
Wanting to be held
Before she went away
Wandering through the night

She was a man in white
Trying to leave town
He would've? her down
Before he left the store

Left her in the door
Left her in the store

I don't know turtleneck where you've been all my life
But I feel, turtleneck, that you're leaving me aside
I don't know turtleneck where you've been all my life
But I feel, turtleneck, that you're leaving me aside
