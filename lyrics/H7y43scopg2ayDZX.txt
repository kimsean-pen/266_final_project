ln the morning I'm okay
Just fine in the afternoon
But at night I think about you
Like an echo in my brain
I wonder if you hear it too
'Cause at night I think about you

And it's just madness
How love can lead you to sadness
I lay awake and imagine

At night I think about you
Even when I'm not supposed to
Baby, sleeping without you just isn't right
Trust me, I've tried it a thousand times
At night I think about you
Do you still think of me too?
'Cause I can't shake you off my mind
And I don't know what to do
At night I think about ya

'Cause at night I think about you

Slowly when I close my eyes
Every time I go to bed
Your song still plays in my head
How foolish of me to fantasize

Bout everything we used to be
Letting go ain't that easy
It's just madness
You're here then you're gone
It's like magic
I lay awake and imagine
You think of me

The way I think about you, baby
'Cause every night I'm going crazy
At night I think about you
Even when I'm not supposed to
Baby, sleeping without you just isn't right
Trust me, I've tried a thousand times
At night I think about you
Do you still think of me too?
'Cause I can't shake you off my mind

And I don't know what to do
'Cause at night I think about ya
Ooh, time after time
Enduring watch you go, goodbye
Show up in my dreams at night
'Cause, baby, in the dark you still shine
Sad but true

Nothing's the saddest getting over you
Eyes are wide open the whole night through
'Cause at night I think about you
Even when I'm not supposed to
Baby, sleeping without you just isn't right
Trust me, I've tried a thousand times
At night I think about you
Do you still think of me too?
'Cause I can't shake you off my mind
And I don't know what to do
(Don't know what to do)
'Cause at night I think about you
At night I think about you
You, yeah
I can't get no sleep at night
At night I think about ya
