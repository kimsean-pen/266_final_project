I know you're probably sleepin'
But I got this thing I keep thinkin'
Yeah, I admit I've been drinkin'
The void is back and I'm blinkin'

I cannot stop that aeroplane from crashin'
And we circle down from the sky
Yeah, so hang on me
Hang on me,
hang on me

'Cause you and me
We're not meant for this world
You and me
We're not meant for this world

I know you hate my hysterics
I promise this time it's different
I won't cry over from the kitchen
Just please, oh, please don't hang up yet
I cannot stop the taxi cab from crashin'
And only lovers will survive

Yeah, so hang on me
Hang on me,
hang on me

'Cause you and me
We're not meant for this world
You and me
We're not meant for this world
You and me
We're not meant for this world
You and me
We're not meant for this world
