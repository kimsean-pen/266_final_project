I'm not buying it, no not a word that you say
I'm not trying it, not gonna make that mistake
Cause you're screaming at me to
Believe in your dreams but I won't
Cause it's bodies that they're built on

Wasteland your kingdom of misery
Shackles all around
Like asking for tyranny (Tyranny)

I'm not lying when, I say your rage is a joke
I'm not tying it, but I would sell you the rope
Won't account for the doubt that's not
What it's about still I won't
'Cause it's bodies that they're built on

Wasteland
Your kingdom of misery
Shackles all around
Like asking for tyranny (Tyranny)

100 million dead prove you wrong they're screaming
100 million dead prove you wrong they're screaming

Wasteland
Your kingdom of misery
Shackles all around
Like asking for tyranny (Tyranny)

100 million dead
100 million dead
100 million dead
100 million dead prove you wrong they're screaming
