I had a soul transplant operation
Cos my bypass didn't funtion
So now I'm keeping on my toes
Till I see your one-man show

God! show me magic
God! show me magic
God! show me magic
God! show me magic...

And wouldn't it be nice to know
What the paper doesn't show
And what the tv doesn't say
And what my hamsters ate today...?

God! show me magic
God! show me magic
God! show me magic
God! show me magic...
