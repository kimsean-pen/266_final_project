One, two
And one, two, three

Looking for my brother
He's a-hiding in the field
He's taking people cover
And he's somewhere out of reach

Close my eyes, count to ten
Ready or not, here I come again
I can't find him anywhere
Don't take eyes to see
That my brother's always been there
Just been a hide and seek

Looking for my lover
She's a mystery
Keeps it under cover
Keep inside her on the rain
Hold my breath, count to ten
Ready or not, here I come again

Fills my life with wonder
Don't take eyes to feel
That my lover's always been there
Just been a hide and seek

I can see the light (I can see the light)
Like it's blinding me (Like it's blinding me)
Taking it in right
Set me free

Searching for the answer
Looking clouded and concealed
Cast away the past and future
Find the truth in honesty

Close my mind, count to ten
Don't ya know the power comes from within

There ain't nobody else here
Well, if you win it, it will be
That the answer's always been there
Just been a hide and seek
