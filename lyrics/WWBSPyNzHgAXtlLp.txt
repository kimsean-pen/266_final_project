You are we

Here lies our addiction
The price is a truce
To hide the afflicted right under our nose
Tyrants deprivers of truth
Take what you can
We've got nothing to lose

So come and get it
We've got nothing to lose
Yeah I fucking said it
Deprivers of the truth

To be honest they force this upon us
Show us the path
Paved with glass
Sentiment at last
The knife behind your back

Our smoke will paint the sky
Cover up the lights that guide us
Celebrate decline
We made our bed and I will lie to you
That everythings alright
We'll dam the river
We'll dam the river and try to

Hide from the water
Pre creation in the reign of sin
If the land has been swallowed
We'll learn how to swim
Begging for our sorrow
The tides are turning

You want your countless wars
We want to count less wars
You want to point the blame
At the heretics
But you're the hypocrites
Its only hate you preach
And when we call for peace
You call it anarchy
I hope your god can save you
As your devil leads the way
Yeah

We've got nothing to lose
So come and get it
We've got nothing to lose
Yeah I fucking said it
Deprivers of the truth

It's like raking dead leaves in the wind
It's like saints living life without sins
It's like digging our graves in the sand
It's like raking dead leaves in the wind

Our smoke will paint the sky
Cover up the lights that guide us
Celebrate decline
We made our bed and I will lie to you
That everything's alright
You are we
You are we
Lucifer
You are we
