All I wanted comes in colors
Vanish everyday
I keep these promises, these promises
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
We keep these promises, these promises

Can you call it? See it coming?
Just enough to tell a story 'bout a
Portrait of a young girl waiting
For a new year

All you ever wanted
Is it getting away?
Visions of a feeling
The footsteps at bay

You were getting stronger
Memories again
Now you're open wider
It's better this way

All I wanted comes in colors
Vanish everyday
I keep these promises, these promises
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
We keep these promises, these promises

Won't you write a letter
On the page in your own way
Write it in a letter
On the page, it's your own way

You were getting wiser
It's better this way
Faces in the mirror
Memories again

Now look to a feeling
It's lighter than breath
All you ever wanted
Is it getting away?

Can you call it? See it coming?
Just enough to tell a story 'bout a
Portrait of a young girl waiting
For the ending of an era

Can you call it? See it coming?
Just enough to tell a story 'bout a
Portrait of a young girl waiting
For the new year
