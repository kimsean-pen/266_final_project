Fuck out my way when you see me
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
Fuck out my way when you see me

I'm rollin' with the LGBT
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
I'm rollin' with the LGBT

Lookin' like we belong on TV
I'm rollin' with the LGBT

Too cool for this shit, look at my body language
Shit on everything, I need some potty trainin'

Money missin', had to ask him, "Where the rest, dummy?"
Before I call my bitches up, they say "yes, hunty"

Judge one of the studs, they gone bring some thugs
Judge one of my drags, catch a heel up yo' ass

Don't judge a lesbian, 'cause she don't want you back man

Judge one of the gays, they drag you from Z to A

And shout out to the bi's, you ain't gotta pick a side
And if you in the closet, shorty, you ain't gotta hide

Gotta make these bitches sick when they see you
And if a bitch want beef, give her beef stew

Stripper right in front of me, I hope she washed her ass
She lookin' at my fine gays, but they don't wanna smash
Know they 'bout to act a fool, time is past due
Then the gays hop on stage, like I can shake my ass too

Fuck out my way when you see me
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
Fuck out my way when you see me
I'm rollin' with the LGBT

I'm rollin' with the LGBT
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
Lookin' like we belong on TV
I'm rollin' with the LGBT

Fashion wise they don't play
When they step out, they gone slay
I'm talkin' tight jeans, good hygienes
Mothafuckas stay fleek everyday (we fleek!)

Fuck with them, you better run off
No skydivers gon' jump off, no pun intended
Hoes offended 'cause they see we flyer than flight attendants

Do a hair flip then I dip
In the strip club throwin' tips

In V.I.P., I'm 'bout to buy more
'Cause life too short like high scores

Tissue in my bra, bitch, gone head (goin' in)
Bad bitch, and I got long legs (long legs)
Ass super fluff, full of cornbread
I shut a bitch up like a phone dead

Fuck out my way when you see me
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
Fuck out my way when you see me
I'm rollin' with the LGBT

I'm rollin' with the LGBT
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
Lookin' like we belong on TV
I'm rollin' with the LGBT

I'm rollin' with the LGBT
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
