With a purposeful grimace and a terrible sound
He pulls the spitting high tension wires down
Helpless people on a subway train
Scream bug-eyed as he looks in on them
He picks up a camero and he throws it back down
As he wades through the buildings toward the center of town
Oh no,
they say he's got to go
Go, go Godzilla
Oh no,
There goes Tokyo
Go, go Godzilla

Oh no,
they say he's got to go
Go, go Godzilla
Oh no,
there goes Tokyo
Go, go Godzilla

Godzilla
Zilla
God
Zilla

Oh no,
they say he's got to go
Go, go Godzilla
Oh no,
there goes Tokyo
Go, go Godzilla
History shows us again and again
How nature points out the folly of men
Godzilla
History shows us again and again
How nature points out the folly of men
Godzilla
History shows us again and again
How nature points out the folly of men
Godzilla
History shows us again and again
How nature points out the folly of men
Godzilla
