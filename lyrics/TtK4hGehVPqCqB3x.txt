Sitting in a corner all alone
Staring from the bottom of his soul
Watching the night come in from the window, window

It'll all collapse tonight
The fullmoon is here again
In sickness and in health
Understanding to demanding

It has no name, there's one for every season
Makes him insane to know
Running away from it all

"I'll be safe in the cornfields"
He thinks, hunted by his own
Again he feels the moon
Rising on the sky

Find a barn which to sleep in
But can he hide anymore
Someone's at the door
Understanding too demanding
Can this be wrong
It's love that is not ending

Makes him insane to know
She should not lock the open door
(run away run away, run way)
Fullmoon is on the sky

And he's not a man anymore
Sees the change in him but can't
(run away run away, run away)
See what became out of her man...

Fullmoon
Swimming across the bay
The night is gray, so calm today
She doesn't wanna wait.
"We've gotta make the love complete tonight..."
In the mist of the morning

He cannot fight anymore
Thousands moons or more
He's been howling
Knock on the door
And scream that is soon ending
Mess on the floor again...
She should not lock the open door
(run away run away, run way)
Fullmoon is on the sky
And he's not a man anymore
Sees the change in him but can't
(run away run away, run away)
See what became out of her man...
She should not lock the open door
(run away run away, run way)
Fullmoon is on the sky
And he's not a man anymore
Sees the change in him but can't
(run away run away, run away)
See what became out of her darling man
She should not lock the open door
(run away run away, run way)
Fullmoon is on the sky
And he's not a man anymore
Oh ooh ohh...
See what became out of her man
