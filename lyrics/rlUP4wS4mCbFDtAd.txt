Lord I'm a workhorse
When I am able
More like a warhorse
Caught in the stable

Of my mind
Staplin' my time
Staplin' my time
Oh, staplin' my time, time, time

They wanna feel oh the wheel of control
All the diamonds, all the coal
Thieves wearing gold, visible lines
Thieves wearing gold, visible lines

They wanna watch me work
They can't see me bleed
I show you how to turn somethin' into nothin'
It's not as easy as it seems

I moved alone down here
Love the storm that I've known
Though it's changed
Since I was just a boy

I moved alone down here
Love the storm that I've known
Though it's changed
Since I was just a boy

I come in where you've been
I've been under the sky
I come in where you've been
I've been under the sky

I only stayed down
For one lonely cigarette
Now I see it's high time
For mischief once again

I moved alone down here
Love the storm that I've known
Thought it's changed
Since I was just a boy

I moved alone down here
Love the storm that I've known
Thought it's changed
Since I was just a boy

Lord I'm a workhorse
When I am able
More like a warhorse
Caught in the stable
More like a warhorse
Caught in the stable
More like a warhorse
Caught in the stable
