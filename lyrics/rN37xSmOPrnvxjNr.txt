While emotions try to come out
Desperately I seek in their path
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

To hide emotions cause a blow out
Desperately I seek their blast
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

I'm going to freeze
Is it my imagination?
It's underground

But I can feel it the same

What I need now
What I need is to live to hide
When you smothered my devotion
With your lies

And I feel now
As I did that time
That I'm wondering why
Still I make you cry

While emotions try to come out
Desperately I seek their path
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

To hide emotions cause to blow out
Desperately I seek their blast
A way so I cannot be outdone
And to finish this search for the meaning

Suffering while I'm depending on seasons
Roots under me are embracing the earth
