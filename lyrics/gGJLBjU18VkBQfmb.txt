Yeah!
Baby!
I'm comin' to get ya

You might stop a hurricane
Might even stop the drivin' rain
You might have a dozen other guys
But if you wanna stop me baby don't even try

I'm goin' one way
Your way
It's such a strong way
Let's make it our way

Now baby
I can't stop this thing we started
You gotta know it's right
I can't stop this course we've plotted
Yeah!
This thing called love we got it
No place for the brokenhearted
Can't stop this thing we started, no way
I'm goin' your way!
Yeah

You might stop the world spinnin' round
Might even walk on holy ground
I ain't superman and I can't fly
But if you wanna stop me baby don't even try
I'm goin' one way
Your way
Ohh, it's such a strong way
Let's make it our way

Now baby!
Can't stop this thing we started
You gotta know it's right
I can't stop this course we've plotted
Yeah!
This thing called love we got it
No place for the brokenhearted
Can't stop this thing we started, no way
I'm goin' your way!

Oh, why take it slow?

Hey!
'Cause nothing can stop this thing that we got, no

This thing called love we got it
Ain't no place for the brokenhearted

Can't stop this course we've plotted
Oh yeah! Baby!
