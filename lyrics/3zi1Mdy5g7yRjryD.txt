All of the king's horses and all of the king's men
Couldn't pull my heart back together again
All of the physicians and mathematicians too
Failed to stop my heart from breaking in two

'Cause all I need is you
I just need you
Yeah you got the glue
So I'm gonna give my heart to you

I had a premonition a movie in my mind
Confirming my suspicions of what I would find
It followed me to LA down to Mexico
Came in through the back door at the start of the show

Still all I need is you
I just need you
Yeah you got the glue
So I'm gonna give my heart to you

Oh was a perfect day
Oh in a perfect way
You know something had to go
You left me high
You left me low

Now as I lie in pieces and wait for your return
The sun upon my forehead it burns baby burns baby burns
An eye on all my horses you've slept with all my men
I'm never gonna get it together again

Still all I need is you
I just need you
Yeah you got the glue
So I'm gonna give my heart to you
Yeah you got the glue
And there's nothing I can do
Yeah you got the glue
So I'm gonna give my heart to you
