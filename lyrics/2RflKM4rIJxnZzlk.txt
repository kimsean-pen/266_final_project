I keep drinkin' malted milk1, try'n to drive my blues away
I keep drinkin' malted milk, try'n to drive my blues away
Baby, you just as welcome to my lovin', as the flowers is in May

Malted milk, malted milk, keep rushin' to my head
Malted milk, malted milk, keep rushin' to my head
And I have a funny, funny feelin', and I'm talkin' all out my head

Baby, fix me one more drink, and hug your daddy one more time
Baby, fix me one more drink, and hug your daddy one more time
Keep on stirrin' my malted milk mama, until I change my mind

My door knob keeps on turnin', it must be spooks around my bed
My door knob keeps on turnin', must be spooks around my bed
I have a warm, old feelin', and the hair risin' on my head

Note 1: malted milk, a variation of a milk shake only you add a spoonful of malt,
an extra ingrediant that gives it an additional malted flavor. Thanks to Jimmy
See, soda "jerk" by confession. Malt is a wheat byproduct, grain (as barley)
softened by steeping in water, allowed to germinate, and used especially in
brewing and distilling. See also this discussion.
