Where were the dogs?
Where were the dogs?
Where were the dogs?

That was the year
I slept with the robot
And so I thought that was the worst we'd seen yet
K.C. exploded, but that was expected
The noise on the screen was caused by K.C
Us and K.C., every night at dinner
And I just laughed at the entertainment
K.C.'s yours and K.C.'s coming home

How could you feel?
Tired without clothes
Be in a new place to be
Tired without goals
Another lime or lemon?

Cut with the finest ease
And you're on the road downtown
Then there used to be roads

Machine don't break my heart
To swallow the wine is living
If only we'd get back my breathing
Afraid to get lost in the dark

Up in the reaches, it's spaceless, it's quiet
I'll never know now
K.C. is a robot
What is important?
K.C.'s important
Outside we both froze to the bone

How could you feel?
Tired without roads?
Being in a new place to be
Tired without roads?

Down on the grind, it did it
Fixed all your kind, of weeds
Did you get your weeds alright?

It's the lone ranger, the lone ranger's finally here to see us
The lone ranger's here to sing today
It's the lone ranger, the lone ranger's here

K.C.'s comin', can't ya hear it like the crying wind?
Up there even the airplanes are turnin' in
Flipped over like a train of consorts
Dropped off at the roadblock bus stop

K.C.'s comin', can't ya hear it like the crying wind?
Up there even the airplanes are turnin' in
Flipped over like a train of consorts
Dropped off at the roadblock bus stop

Boiled down, power in the air
Power in the air as I ran down there
Blow ya little down
Power in the air, power in the air as I ran down there

K.C.'s comin', can't ya hear it like the crying wind?
Up there even the airplanes are turnin' in
Flipped over like a train of consorts
Dropped off at the roadblock bus stop

K.C.'s comin', can't ya hear it like the crying wind?
Up there even the airplanes are turnin' in
Flipped over like a train of consorts
Dropped off at the roadblock bus stop

Boiled down, power in the air
Power in the air as I ran down there
Blow ya little down
Power in the air, power in the air as I ran down there

KC, KC
KC, KC
KC, KC
KC, KC

K.C.'s comin', can't ya hear it like the crying wind?

Dropped off at the roadblock bus stop

K.C.'s comin', can't ya hear it like the crying wind?
Up there even the airplanes are turnin' in
Flipped over like a train of consorts
