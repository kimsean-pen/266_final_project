Keeping it locked away
A secret on every page
But now you're getting close
Feels like a dragon's breath
Fire against my chest
Burning through the snow

I can't hide it, I can't hide it
From you
In ultraviolet, ultraviolet
You see through

Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it
When you're ultraviolet

Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it

Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it
When you're ultraviolet

Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it

You're reading all of me
Reading all of me
Reading all of me
Ooh, ooh
Not seeing what they see
Not seeing what they see, oh

No, I can't hide it

No, I can't hide it
You're ultraviolet

You're reading all of me
Reading all of me
Reading all of me
Ooh, ooh
Not seeing what they see
Not seeing what they see, oh

Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it
When you're ultraviolet

Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it

You're reading all of me
Reading all of me
Reading all of me
Ooh, ooh
Not seeing what they see
Not seeing what they see, oh
