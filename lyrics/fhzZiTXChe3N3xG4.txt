93 million miles from the sun
People get ready, get ready
'Cause here it comes, it's a light
A beautiful light, over the horizon into our eyes
Oh, my my how beautiful, oh my beautiful mother
She told me, "Son in life you're gonna go far
If you do it right you'll love where you are

Just know
Wherever you go
You can always come home"

240 thousand miles from the moon
We've come a long way to belong here to
Share this view of the night, a glorious night
Over the horizon is another bright sky
Oh, my my how beautiful, oh my irrefutable father
He told me, "Son sometimes it may seem dark
But the absence of the light is a necessary part

Just know
You're never alone
You can always come back home"
Home, home
You can always come back

Every road is a slippery slope
There is always a hand that you can hold on to
Looking deeper through the telescope
You can see that your home's inside of you

Just know
That wherever you go
No, you're never alone
You will always get back home
Home, home
Home, home, home

93 million miles from the Sun
People get ready, get ready
'Cause here it comes it's a light, a beautiful light
Over the horizon into our eyes
