Friday night we feel alright cause this is what we do
We're in the crowd, we're dancing now but all I see is you
I tell myself we've broken up but it's still hard to say
I try to turn my head around and look the other way

What you really care about me?
Do you care about me?
Are you ever coming back to me, back to me?
Here we go

I should know better but I just can't pretend
Uh oh, uh oh
I'm falling again
Just when we promised that we'd only be friends
Uh oh, uh oh
I'm falling again

It's monday night, we're back to work, we're at the studio
I'm trying to cut this song but I keep starin' at the phone
I wish that you would call and say we made a big mistake
And keepin' it together is a chance we wanna take

What you really care about me?
Do you care about me?
Are you ever coming back to me, back to me?
Here we go

I should know better but I just can't pretend
Uh oh, uh oh
I'm falling again
Just when we promised that we'd only be friends
Uh oh, uh oh
I'm falling again

Make my heart super ecstaticspin my world into a havoc
You had me from the very first day
Me and you it's automatic
Here's my heart boy you can have it
Tell me that you're feeling this way

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh oh oh oh
Uh oh, uh oh
I'm falling again
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh oh oh oh
Uh oh, uh oh

Here we go
I should know better but I just can't pretend
Uh oh, uh oh
I'm falling again (here we go)
Just when we promised that we'd only be friends
Uh oh, uh oh
I'm falling again

Here we go
I should know better but I just can't pretend
Uh oh, uh oh
I'm falling again (here we go)
Just when we promised that we'd only be friends
Uh oh, uh oh
I'm falling again

Uh oh, uh oh
I'm falling again
Uh oh, uh oh
I'm falling again
