I am not a beauty queen
Drivin' in a limousine
I'm a girl but don't call me baby

Who the fk gets VIP
Live a life in luxury
I don't care so just call me crazy
Can you give it out

Don't stop just take it to the limit
Watch me boy it's spinning around this time
Hush, hush, running to the night, feel alive

I just can't get enough when I'm with you
'Cause your fever makes me feel so good
Turn it up boy you make your move
See I'm burning but it feels so good

Can't get enough when I'm with you
You got fever but it feels so good
Turn it up baby make your move
Keep me burning 'cause it feels so good

I don't need no superman
Trying to tell me who I am
Know it all's a driving me crazy

Nothing ever is for sure
I can't take this anymore
All I want is yes or no baby
Can you give it out

Don't stop just take it to the limit
Watch me boy it's spinning around this time

Hush, hush, running to the night, feel alive

I just can't get enough when I'm with you
'Cause your fever makes me feel good
Turn it up boy you make your move
See I'm burning but it feels so good

Can't get enough when I'm with you
You got fever but it feels so good
Turn it up baby make your move
Keep me burning 'cause it feels so good

It's so hot - Do it, do it real good
Can't stop - Do it, do it real good
It's so hot - Do it, do it real good
Can't stop - Do it, do it real good

It's so hot - Do it, do it real good
Baby you got fever
Can't stop - Do it, do it real good
Baby you got fever
It's so hot - Do it, do it real good
Baby you got fever
Can't stop

I just can't get enough when I'm with you
'Cause your fever makes me feel good
Turn it up boy you make your move
See I'm burning but it feels so good

Can't get enough when I'm with you
You got fever but it feels so good
Turn it up baby make your move
Keep me burning 'cause it feels so good
