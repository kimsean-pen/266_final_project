The people are freezing
And the water is warm
And the ice caps are melting
What will happen when they're gone?

Will the experts look stupid
And invert the facts
Will they give you back your donations
Or keep the paper stacks

The feeling is mutual
You don't like what we do
Because we say what we are thinking
And that shocks and frightens you

The lion in the jungle shows no shame, it shows no pride
It does what it needs to to stay strong and to survive, yeah

The hunter
The hunter

You can keep it
Don't want it
Keep smiling through your teeth
Oh what is it
Your justice cut the hands of the thief
He was starving
His children were crying to be fed
And now they're bawling
And dying
But at least you are ahead

Just be patient
Keep waiting
That's what they always say
But you're tired and you're aching
And the pain won't go away

So stand up and speak out
See that your needs are met
Oh the odds are against you
But please place your bets, yeah

You keep it
We don't want it
You keep it
We don't want it
The hunter
You keep it
The hunter
We don't want it
The hunter
You keep it
The hunter
We don't want it

It's useless
And worthless
We're staring at the sun
Oh it is reckless
And pointless
But it's also very fun
It's useless
And worthless
We're staring at the sun
Oh it is reckless
And pointless
But it's also very fun
It's useless
And worthless
We're staring at the sun
Oh it is reckless
And pointless
But it's also very fun
It's useless
And worthless
We're staring at the sun
Oh it is reckless
And pointless
But it's also very fun

You keep it
We don't want it
You keep it
We don't want it
The hunter
You keep it
The hunter
We don't want it
The hunter
You keep it
The hunter
We don't want it
