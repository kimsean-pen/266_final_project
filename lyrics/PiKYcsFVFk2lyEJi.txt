When it all began, was it time that we asked for?
Or was it anything to feel complete forevermore?
Wanna see myself like I used to back then
But every time I turn around I'm in LA again
Don't take this for granted, that's not how we planned it I know,
We're tearing these pages before we get to watch it unfold

Yeah, it's a long road
You think your time is running out
Gotta be looking up when it goes down

Know that I've seen better days
Turned and looked the other way
But with you I can't see past the crystal ball
(To all we ever wanted)
I can't fight this disconnection
You can see my imperfection still,
At least I'll never be ungrateful

Opposite of here there's a bold faced enemy
But sure enough, when I look up, it's myself staring back at me
I'm not saying there's a reason close it up and leave it, even though
We'd still be tearing the pages
before the rest of it changes so let's go

'Cause it's a long road
You think your time is wearing thin
Remember to breathe out when you dive in

Know that I've seen better days
Turned and looked the other way
But with you I can't see past the crystal ball
(To all we ever wanted)
I can't fight this disconnection
You can see my imperfection still,
At least I'll never be ungrateful

I think my nights are my days I can feel you slipping away
So savor every moment don't you stay in disarray
I think my nights are my days I can feel you slipping away
Can we savor every moment find ourselves along the way, I confess

That it's a long road
You think your time is running out
Gotta be looking up when it goes down

Know that I've seen better days
Turned and looked the other way
But with you I can't see past the crystal ball
(To all we ever wanted)
I can't fight this disconnection
You can see my imperfection still,
At least I'll never be ungrateful
