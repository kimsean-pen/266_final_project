There's no need for distance
No need for touch
No need for answers 'cause I've heard enough
I've just found a chest some place out of reach
I entered the darkness and laid my release
I open open my heart
Seem like a nightingale opened opened my hands
When no one else understands

I just close my eyes
And count to ten
Breathing twice
And open them
Nowhere to go cause I've been there before
In my mind it is near
I escape all I fear
So by closing my eyes
I am anywhere but here

There's no need for anger
Religion or faith
One glade of grief
Will always remain
It's not on the paper
Or a story book
It's a place to reunite with all that was took
I open open my heart
Seem like a nightingale opened opened my hands
When no one else understands

I just close my eyes
And count to ten
Breathing twice
And open them
Nowhere to go cause I've been there before
In my mind it is near
I escape all I fear
So by closing my eyes
I am anywhere but here

Picture a land where you never have been
Where life is a eternal and ever green
The future of happiness and certainty
You're loved and you're lost for now in eternity

I just close my eyes
And count to ten
Breathing twice
And open them
Nowhere to go cause I've been there before
In my mind it is near
I escape all I fear
So by closing my eyes
I am anywhere but here
