I got shit to do
I know you do too
But I won't let go of you
'Til you push me away

The second you leave
I miss you
I could see you tomorrow
But I don't wanna wait

So kiss me in the doorway
Always on your way out
I'm tryna make you stay
So we can make out
Kiss me in the doorway
Always on your way out
I'm tryna make you stay
So we can make out

You're an open book
But I can't read you
Start the countdown
Untill I lose it three, two... one

I'm done
I'm dead
Forget what I said
I'm done
I'm dead
Forget what I said

Kiss me in the doorway
Always on your way out
I'm tryna make you stay
So we can make out
Kiss me in the doorway
Always on your way out
I'm tryna make you stay
So we can make out

I know what you like
So baby don't go
Kiss you so slow
I know what you like
So baby don't go
Kiss you so slow

Kiss me in the doorway
Always on your way out
I'm tryna make you stay
So we can make out
Kiss me in the doorway
Always on your way out
I'm tryna make you stay
So we can make out

Make out
Make out
Make out
Make out
