Eli's coming, Eli's coming
Well, you better hide your heart, your loving heart
Eli's coming and the cards say a broken heart

Eli's coming, hide your heart, girl
Eli's coming, hide your heart, girl
Girl, Eli's coming, you better hide
Girl, Eli's coming, you better hide
Girl, Eli's coming, you better hide
Girl, Eli's coming, hide your heart, girl, hide it
You better, better hide your heart

Eli's coming, better walk, walk
But you'll never get away
No, you'll never get away from the burning heartache
I walked to Apollo by the bay

Everywhere I go though, Eli's coming
(She walked but she never got away)
Eli's coming
(She walked but she never got away)
Eli's coming and he's coming to get ya
(She walked but, she walked but)
Get down on your knees
(She walked but she never got away)

Eli's coming, hide it, hide it, hide it
Girl, Eli's coming, you better hide
Girl, Eli's coming, you better hide
Girl, Eli's coming, you better hide
Girl, Eli's coming, hide your heart, girl, hide it
You better, better hide your heart

Eli's coming, better walk, walk
But you'll never get away
No, you'll never get away from the burning heartache
I walked to Apollo by the bay

Everywhere I go though, Eli's coming
(She walked but she'll never get away)
Eli's coming
(She walked but she'll never get away)
Eli's coming and he's coming to get ya
(She walked but, she walked but)
Get down on your knees
(She walked but she'll never get away)
Get down on your knees

No, no, no, no
Lord, I said, no, no, no, no, no, no
Hide it, she can hide it, hide it
Hide it, you better hide it
Somebody hide it, you got to hide it
Oh, my, hide it
