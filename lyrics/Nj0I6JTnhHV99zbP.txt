Your veil
Came Down
For judgement day
What took to the skies?
What took you away?

Tears ran fast
And so did blood
But nothing could break
Through your ice

We're always close
But never there
What came from the skies
To take you away?

Our children grew
Left us behind
But no one should pay
Such a price

Just another day
And they're all the same
In this world or the next
You bring me down
And I resurrect
In this world or the next
