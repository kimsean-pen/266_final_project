Oh, I guess you know
Just how far I like to go
Coz I hear ur telling me
That no means yes and yes means no
Oh, I guess you don't
Never play a player
And now you won't
Half the game is through the fight
Let's see if you last the night

Pick it up where I left it for you
Don't miss a beat
Got more shit for you
Don't get slack
Or I'll ignore you

Pick it up where I left it for you
Don't miss a beat
Got more shit for you
Don't get slack
Or I'll ignore you

Oh, I guess you're new
Don't know what they're tellin you
But I'll show you what to do
One round with me
You'll fully slew
Oh, got pussy on lock
Out here tellin bare man
Wots wot
Cum real clever
Right there hit the spot

Oh, I guess you know
Just how far I like to go
Coz I hear ur telling me
That no means yes and yes means no
Oh, I guess you don't
Never play a player
And now you won't
Half the game is through the fight
Let's see if you last the night

O
