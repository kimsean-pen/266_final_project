Lover please, come back to me
And hold me near
Lover please, come back to me
Your voice I long to hear
You told me you loved me
Why'd you tell me lies?
Coz' if you loved me
You wouldn't need that disguise

Lover please, come back to me
Don't make me cry
Lover please, come back to me
Don't say goodbye
You know that I'm sorry
I made you blue
There will never be another
Boy for me like you

It's been a long long time since you been at home
Since you left me
I've been so alone

Lover please, come back to me
Don't make me cry
Lover please, come back to me
Don't say goodbye
You know that I'm sorry
I made you blue
There will never be another
Boy for me like you

Come back, come back to me (please come back)
Come on back, come back to me (please come back)
Come on back, come back to me (please come back)
Come on back now, come back to me (please come back)
