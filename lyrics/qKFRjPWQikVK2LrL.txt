Sunspots cast a glare in my eyes
Sometimes i forget I'm alive
I feel it coming and I've gotta get out of it's way
I hear it calling and I come cause I can't disobey
I should not listen and I shouldn't believe but I do
Yes I do

She turns me on
She makes it real
I have to apologize
For the way I feel

My life it seems has taken a turn
Why in the name of god would i ever want to return

Peel off our skin we're gonna burn what we were to the ground
Fuck in the fire and we'll spread all the ashes around
I wanna kill away the rest of what's left
And I do
Yes I do

She turns me on
She makes it real
I have to apologize
For the way I feel

And nothing can stop me now
There is nothing to fear
And everything I'd ever want
Is inside of here

Woah woah woah woah
Inside us here

Now I just stare into the sun
And i see everything I've done
I think I could have been someone
But I can't stop what has begun
When everything is said and done
And there is no place left to run
I think I used to be someone
Now I just stare into the sun
