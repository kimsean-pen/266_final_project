The heart is a stone and this is a stone that we throw
Put your hand on this stone it's the stone of a home you'll know
They say we will go far but they don't know how far we'll go
With our legs on the edge and our feet on the horizon

They say we can throw far but they don't know how far we throw
With our legs on the edge and our feet on the horizon
The heart is a stone and this is a stone that we throw
They say we will go far but they don't know how far we'll go

It can't be gone
We're still right here
It took so long
Can't say we heard it all
Limbs parallel
We stood so long we fell
Tear a moment from the days
That carry us on forever

This push and pull is the force of a wave of time
In the heat of a night, we would cry, you are not mine
They said we would go far but they didn't know how far we'd go
Cause this heart is a stone and this is a stone that we throw

It can't be gone
We're still right here
It took so long
Can't say we saw it all
Limbs parallel
We stood so long we fell
Bright pyramids at night
That carry us on forever

It can't be gone
We're still right here
It took so long
Can't say we felt it all
Limbs parallel
We stood so long we fell
Love's like a pantheon
It carries on forever
