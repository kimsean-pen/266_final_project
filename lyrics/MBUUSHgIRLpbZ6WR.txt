I've seen her face, I've heard her name
I've lost my place and she's to blame
And I can't stand it when I'm staring in her eyes
And she's not looking back, it's not a big surprise

I've heard music, I've heard noise
I wish that she could hear her voice
The way that I do when I go to sleep at night
And dream my life away but she's gone when I awake

Sami, Sami...
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me?

The way her hair falls in her eyes
Makes me wonder if she'll
Ever see through my disguise
And I'm under her spell

Everything is falling
And I don't know where to land
Everyone knows who she is
But she don't know who I am

Sami, Sami...
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me?

I see you singing on that stage
You look just like an angel
And all I do is pray

That maybe, someday you'll hear my song
And understand that all along
There's something more that I'm trying to say
When I say

Sami, Sami...
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me?

What you're doing to me!

Sami, Sami...
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me?

What you're doing to me...
