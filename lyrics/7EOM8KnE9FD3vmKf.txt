If you want my love
You must not hide anything
Better I know you better I fight
Fight this thing
Better I know you better I fight
Fight
This
Thing
Your
Your dark side
Lights up my seaside
Your bright side
Fires up my inside
Your
Your dark side
Lights up my seaside
Your bright side
Fires up my inside
Your
Your dark side
Lights up my seaside
Your bright side
Fires up my inside
Three words you should not forget
Three shapes you became
Remember I love you remember I fight
fight this thing
Remember I love you remember I fight
fight this thing
