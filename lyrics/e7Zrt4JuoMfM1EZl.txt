She said she'd take me anywhere, she'd take me anywhere
As long as she stays with me
She said she'd take me anywhere, she'd take me anywhere
As long as she stays with me

Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips

She said she'd take me anywhere, she'd take me anywhere
As long as she stays with me
She said she'd take me anywhere, she'd take me anywhere
As long as she stays with me

Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips

She said she'd take me anywhere, she'd take me anywhere
As long as she stays with me
She said she'd take me anywhere, she'd take me anywhere
As long as she stays with me

Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips

Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
