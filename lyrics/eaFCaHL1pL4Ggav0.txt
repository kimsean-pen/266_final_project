Every now and then
I get a feeling
That I've left something behind me
But I don't know what it is yet

Like I tied a piece of string
Round my finger
And I hope this will remind me
Of the places I have been through

When I'm down, down, down
When I'm down, down, down

Every now and then
When I'm feeling lonely
I turn on my radio
Because I'm hoping that you're out there

It seems so long ago
I would see your writing
On a postcard or a note
And your stories would excite me

When I was down, down, down
When I'm down, down, down

With every new step along the way
I hope that the wind blows you
Back into my life
At the end of the road
And if I'm only dreaming
Then won't you tear the curtains down
And let the light back into this empty room?

Kissing in your room
Climbing out the window
Trying not to make a sound, but
With my first love on my mind

You see, we were never through
I never said I loved you
Even when we said goodbye
Never thought it was the last time

Down, down, down
And I'm down, down, down

With every new step along the way
I hope the wind'll blow you
Back into my life
At the end of the road
And still, every now and then I hear a voice
Singing to me softly
Deep inside my head
And it sings till I fall asleep
If I'm only dreaming
Won't someone tear the curtains down?
Tear the curtains down

Every now and then
I get a feeling
It's like I've left something behind
But I don't know what it is yet

Every now and then
When you're feeling lonesome
Just sing this melody
And remember where going

When you're down, down, down
When you're down, down, down
When you're down, down, down
When you're down, down, down
When you're down, down, down, down
When you're down, down, down, down, down
