I know you've been waiting round
Speaking high but looking down
You don't have to be alone
You're not alone

I hear the words you choose to speak
But listen to what's underneath
You never have to be alone
You're not alone

I know I know, yeah, I know how it feels
Trying to be whole when you're still trying to heal
I know I know, yeah, I know how it feels

So give me your, give me your, give me your all
I'll run when you run and I'll stay when you fall
So give me your, give me your, give me your all

Hold on tight, it's a long long night
If you wanna get to where you wanna go
So grit your teeth, I could be all you need
'Til you get there, I won't give up
I won't give-
Ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh, ooooh, oooh, ooh
So grit your teeth, I could be all you need
'Til you get there, I won't give up
I won't give up

I can see right through your pride
A stubborn kind of compromise
You still don't have to be alone
Never alone

I know I know, yeah, I know how it feels
Trying to be whole when you're still trying to heal
I know I know, yeah, I know how it feels

So give me your, give me your, give me your all
I'll run when you run and I'll stay when you fall
So give me your, give me your, give me your all

Hold on tight, it's a long long night
If you wanna get to where you wanna go
So grit your teeth, I could be all you need
'Til you get there, I won't give up
I won't give-
Ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh, ooooh, oooh, ooh
So grit your teeth, I could be all you need
'Til you get there, I won't give up
I won't give up

Keep holding on for me
'Cause I could be all you need
Keep holding on for me, on for me, on for me

I know I know, yeah, I know how it feels
Trying to be whole when you're still trying to heal
I know I know, yeah, I know how it feels

So give me your, give me your, give me your all
I'll run when you run and I'll stay when you fall
So give me your, give me your, give me your all

Hold on tight, it's a long long night
If you wanna get to where you wanna go
So grit your teeth, I could be all you need
'Til you get there, I won't give up
I won't give-
Ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh, ooooh, oooh, ooh
So grit your teeth, I could be all you need
'Til you get there, I won't give up
I won't give up

Keep holding on for me
'Cause I could be all you need
Keep holding on for me, on for me, on for me
