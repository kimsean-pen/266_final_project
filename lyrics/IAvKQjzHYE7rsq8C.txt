People will know when they see this show
The kind of a guy I am
They'll recognize just what I stand for
And what I just can't stand

They'll perceive what I believe in
and what I know is true
They'll recognize I'm a one man guy
Always was through and through

People meditate, hey that's just great
Trying to find the inner you
People depend on family and friends
And other folks to pull them through

I don't know why I'm a one man guy
Or why I'm a one man show
But these three cubic feet of bone and blood and meat
Are all I love and know

'Cause I'm a one man guy in the morning
Same in the afternoon
One man guy when the sun goes down
I whistle me a one man tune
One man guy, one man guy
Only kinda guy to be

I'm a one man guy, I'm a one man guy
I'm a one man guy is me

I'm gonna bathe and shave and dress myself
And eat solo every night
Unplug the phone, sleep alone
Stay way out of sight

Sure it's kinda lonely
Yeah it's sort of sick
Being your own one and only
Is a dirty selfish trick

'Cause I'm a one man guy in the morning
Same in the afternoon
One man guy when the sun goes down
I whistle me a one man tune
One man guy, one man guy
Only kinda guy to be

I'm a one man guy, I'm a one man guy
I'm a one man guy is me
