Loving you ain't easay
Nothin ever is
But I will keep on figh-tin
For a love like this
You know I wouldn't have it
Any other way
Even when times get tough
I don't want no easy love
This is a track for the guys
With
One lady in their life
You wanna pull out your hair sometimes but she's still your girl
A love lasts
It's like a unicorn
Holding on
Or lost all form
Sometimes you wanna thrown in the towel but she's still your girl
Loving you ain't easay
Nothin ever is
But I will keep on figh-tin
For a love like this
You know I wouldn't have it
Any other way
Even when times get tough
I don't want no easy love
The second verse goes to the fe-males
Rollin their eyes when we
Fail
Make you wanna go and shop retail but he's still your man
Oh he cries
Undeniable
Dirtbags
We're professional
Sometimes you wanna throw in the towel but he's still your man
Loving you ain't easay
Nothin ever is
But I will keep on figh-tin
For a love like this
You know I wouldn't have it
Any other way
Even when times get tough
I don't want no easy love
I don't believe in nothing lasts forever
And every time you're feelin down
I know we're gonna work it out
And I know we can't live without each other
O-oh
Well nothin worth havin come easy
And baby you got me singin
Loving you ain't easay
Nothin ever is
But I will keep on figh-tin
For a love like this
You know I wouldn't have it
Any other way
Even when times get tough
I don't want no easy love
Loving you ain't easay
Nothin ever is
But I will keep on figh-tin
For a love like this
You know I wouldn't have it
Any other way
Even when times get tough
I don't want no easy love
