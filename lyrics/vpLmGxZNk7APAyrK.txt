So far, so drab
Can't call it no towers on quest (So)
(So) So worn unclear
If I knew, then I wouldn't be stressed (So)
(So) Get a child, fill your heart
Bust down with the popcorn
Cheap moto with some miles and a memoir
Had a dream, re-emerge at the drug store
Teenage love songs
Score scenes worth Sundance, oh (Oh yeah)
Surely I'll accept, oh (Oh)
My choices breed regrets, oh (Oh)
Hope soon soon there's none left, oh (Oh)
Few folks seen me when my fingers fit the Cheerios
Puffy AmiYumi on the stereo
'Posed to be maestro for Juventus
But events lead to venting for the check pen
Please, unmarked barriers plenty
Wish a nigga would try to press me
Money on the raps like 'Bron
We shouldn't be less than they see

Oh, oh, ooh yeah
Ooh (Ooh)
Mhm, oh, mmm
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love, yeah, you, yeah, you

I get by, I get through
I get over, I get moved
Try my luck, don't try my trust
I get by, I get through
I get over, I get moved
Try my luck, don't try my trust

Cater to no wrong oft implausible
Mission Hill how my top, blue Lucario
Fourth grade, wishin' I could be Kim Possible
I see obstacles, I see ways I ought to go
Didn't mean nothin' by it but it's stinging though
I've heard that before, learned it throwing stones
Ooh, ooh
God bless you (God bless you)
God bless you (God bless you)
If you tryin' (If you tryin')
Don't miss 'em (Don't miss 'em)
Ooh, ooh, who are you to say?
Ooh-ahh, ooh-ahh, ooh-ahh, oh-ahh

I get by, I get through
I get over, I get moved
Try my luck, don't try my trust
I get by, I get through
I get over, I get moved
Try my luck, don't try my trust
