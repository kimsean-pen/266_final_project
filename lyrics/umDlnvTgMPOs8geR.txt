If I was a bird
I would fly high over the world
Come home at night to your garden
build a nest among the branches
and I'll comb your hair with my beak

If I was a bird
I would count my time in pearls
Under my wings you'll find shelter
you'll breed bugs and keep me well fed
and I proclaim the reason why I'll have to fly

But you wanted me to be a girl
without feathers without urge
then my wings quick dissappeared
and left was only fear
and I proclaim the reason why I'll have to fly

proclaim the reason why I'll have to fly
I'll have to fly

But you wanted me to be a girl
without feathers without urge
then my wings quick dissappeared
and left was only fear
and I proclaim the reason why I'll have to fly

proclaim the reason why I'll have to fly
I'll have to fly
