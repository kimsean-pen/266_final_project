In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
Just remember that you talking to me, yo
You need to watch the way you talking to me, yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
And yo, I know some things that you ain't told me
Yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna gimme back
And you gon' show me
So you walk round like you don't know me
You got a new friend
I got homies
But in the end it still so lonely

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

How could you be so Dr. Evil
You're bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gon' speak so why we're up 3 a.m. on the phone?
Why does she be so mad at me for?
Honey I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop won't mess my groove up, cause I already know how this thing go

You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gone' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gone keep hating me
And we just gonna be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
So I'm gon' take off tonight
Into the night

I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?
