I walk alone inside these walls and it's not easy being me
Seems like everytime I escape there's another following
Me, I'm running
Yeah, they're coming
I can feel them shooting me
Without asking, lights are flashing
But I guess that

It's what I've become
Let me live as who I am
Never wanted nothing
But you don't let me breathe as who I am

I've just begun, I've just begun
I've just begun to find my way
I've just begun, I've just begun
I've just begun to find my way

In the chase I know I'm wanted
Hey look, I'm no victim
It'd be nice to make some mistakes without observations
Or opinions of distortions
Deceiving what you're believing
It's a shame that all these blessings can be a curse

It's what I've become
Let me live as who I am
Never wanted nothing
But you don't let me breathe as who I am

I've just begun, I've just begun
I've just begun to find my way
I've just begun, I've just begun
I've just begun to find my way

There's not a pill to take to save me from this heartache
But I have no regrets, I'm hoping for a better day
There's not a pill to take to save me from this heartache
But I have no regrets, I'm hoping for a better day

It's what I've become
Let me live as who I am
Never wanted nothing
But you don't let me breathe as who I am

It's what I've become
Let me live as who I am
Never wanted nothing
But you don't let me breathe as who I am

I've just begun, I've just begun
I've just begun to find my way
I've just begun, I've just begun
I've just begun to find my way
