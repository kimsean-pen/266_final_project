We can change our bad habits
Try to sleep at night
Lost for the moment
I've tried to find
It's the same thing every time
It's some kind of magic
Between you and I
I gotta be honest
Baby
We just can't get it right

Set it up
Spin me round
We're just physical
Oh oh ohs
We're just physical
Turn me on
Turn it up
Unemotional
Every single time
Oh oh oh oh oh
We're just physical
Oh oh oh oh oh
Physical

Not a friend not a lover
Try to act like it's fine
I've read it cover to cover, baby
You know I'm right
It's the same thing every time

Set it up
Spin me round
We're just physical
Oh oh ohs
We're just physical
Turn me on
Turn it up
Unemotional
Every single time
Oh oh oh oh oh
We're just physical
Oh oh oh oh oh
Physical

Baby, you say that you know me, you don't
You don't
And lately you've told me you love me, you don't
You don't
Baby, you say that you know me, you don't
You don't
And lately you've told me you love me, you don't
You don't

Set it up
Spin me round
We're just physical
Oh oh ohs
We're just physical
Turn me on
Turn it up
Unemotional
Every single time
Oh oh oh oh oh
We're just physical
Oh oh oh oh oh
Physical
