Dear Whoever,
Do you remember,
It's me old, Whatshername.

Can't believe it,
You ain't dreming,
I don't look quite the same

But History repeats itself
I kept making a scene
I kept raising hell
Now they call me a queen
And now you're under my spell,
so tell me how does it feel,
Well ...

I'm looking down from the Skyline,
Dancing on the Moonlight
Can you see my name in the stars,
Yeah
I bet you won't forget me now!
My Voice on the Airwaves
it's echoing louder
And louder
I bet you won't forget me now!
I bet you won't forget me now

Hey Whoever
It's been forever
I know you know my name
I heard Ya' still tryna' steel my throne
i guess some things never change

Always knew I'd make it out
Live a Life you dream about
Now the World's in my hands
According to plan

I'm looking down from the Skyline,
Dancing on the Moonlight
Can you see my name in the stars,
Yeah
I bet you won't forget me now!
My Voice on the Airwaves
it's echoing louder
And louder
I bet you won't forget me now!
I bet you won't forget me now

Said you were gonna run this town
Now you get high and just drive around
It didn't happen like you thought it would
Yeah
Hit me up like
"Hope you're good and
Can you out me on the list tonight?
And by the way I got this Clothing Line"
Try to talk like we're old friends,
but you don't even know who I am
Who i am
Who I am

I'm looking down from the Skyline,
Dancing on the Moonlight
Can you see my name in the stars,
Yeah
I bet you won't forget me now!
My Voice on the Airwaves
it's echoing louder
And louder
I bet you won't forget me now!
I bet you won't forget me now
I bet you won't
