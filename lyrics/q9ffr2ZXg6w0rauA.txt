I ruled the world
With these hands I shoock the heavens to the ground
I laid the gods to rest

I held the key to the kingdom lions guarding castle walls
Hail the king of death

Then I lost it all
Dead and broken
My back's against the wall
Cut me open
I'm just trying to breathe
Just trying to figure it out
Because I built these walls to watch them crumbling down.
I said, "Then I lost it all."
Who can save me now?

I stood above
Another war
Another jewel upon the crown
I was the fear of man
But I was blind
I couldn't see the world there right in front of me
But now I can... (Yeah)

'cause I lost it all
Dead and broken
My back's against the wall
Cut me open.
I'm just trying to breathe
Just trying to figure it out
Because I built these walls to watch them crumbling down.
I said, "Then I lost it all."
Who can save me now?

(Oooooooh)

I believe that we all fall down sometimes (Oooooooh)
Can't you see (can't you see) that we all fall down sometimes?
(Oooooooh, yeah, oh, yeah)
I believe that we all fall down sometimes (Oooooooh)
(Can't you see) Can't you see that we all fall down sometimes?
(Yeah, we all, yeah, we all fall down)
Yeah
I believe that we all fall down sometimes
Yeah
