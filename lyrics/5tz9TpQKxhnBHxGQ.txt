I get my kicks and I wanna start a rager
I wanna dance like I'm on the video
I've got a fever for the violent behavior
I'm sweating bullets like a modern Romeo

Bang bang, give me fame
Shoot me up to entertain
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead, I'm well fed
Give me death or give me head
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier

I testify like a lullaby of memories
Broadcasting live and it's on my radio
I've got my photobomb, I've got my Vietnam
I love a lie just like anybody else

Bang bang, give me fame
Shoot me up to entertain
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead, I'm well fed
Give me death or give me head
Broadcasting from my room and playing with my toys
I wanna be a celebrity martyr
The leading man in my own private drama
Hoorah, bang, bang, hoorah, bang, bang, the hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier

I wanna be like the soldiers on the screen
It's my private movie (Holy war)
Oh baby, baby, this is Viva Vendetta
Oh this is love or it's World War Zero

I wanna be a celebrity martyr
The leading man in my own private drama
Hoorah, bang, bang, hoorah, bang, bang, the hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier

I wanna be a celebrity martyr
The leading man in my own private drama
Hoorah, bang, bang, hoorah, bang, bang, the hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier
