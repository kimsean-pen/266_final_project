Seems like yesterday
Was a game we played
Or a scene from a movie
Can't we freeze the frame
Can't we pause the game
Can't you always be with me

Am I running out of time?
Am I really losing my mind?
Am I running out of time?
With you

Can't it just be now forever
You and me together
Now forever
Then you'd stay
Can't it just be now forever
You and me together
Now forever
Then you'd stay

I wish the days to come
Were already gone
Already far behind us
Every kiss goodbye
Every sacrifice
Every time you walk away

Am I running out of time?
Am I really losing my mind?
Am I running out of time?
With you

Can't it just be now forever
You and me together
Now forever
Then you'd stay
Can't it just be now forever
You and me together
Now forever
Then you'd stay
