My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To have the kingdom, baby, tell me why?
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To rule a country, baby, you and I?

If you were my king

My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To have the kingdom, baby, tell me why?
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To rule a country, baby, you and I?

A little princess in a terrible mess
A kingdom alone, with no love to confess
Dreams of a prince on a tall white horse
Runs like a spirit by the castle walls

Gotta steal from the rich, when they don't know I'm coming
Gotta give to the poor, no time for lovin'
My oh my, don't you cry, 'cause there is no way I'm staying
I will leave say "bye bye", I'm going my way

My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To have the kingdom, baby, tell me why?
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To rule a country, baby, you and I?

If you were my king
I would be your queen
If you were my king
I would be your queen

Mystery deep in the royal heart
Crying at night, I wanna be apart
Prince, oh, prince, are you really sincere
Bet you one day you're gonna disappear

Gotta steal from the rich, when they don't know I'm coming
Gotta give to the poor, no time for lovin'
My oh my, don't you cry, 'cause there is no way I'm staying
I will leave, say "bye bye", I'm going my way

My oh my
My oh my
My oh my
My oh my

My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To have the kingdom, baby, tell me why?
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To rule a country, baby, you and I?

My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To have the kingdom, baby, tell me why?
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To rule a country, baby, you and I?

If you were my king
I would be your queen
If you were my king
I would be your queen
