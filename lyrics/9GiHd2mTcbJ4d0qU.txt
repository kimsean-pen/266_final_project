In front of the line in disguise
Waiting for panic panic
Guided manic manic
There's a reason for this strange behavior
Behind his lines the preacher hides

Joining their hands the leading man
Raises the panic panic
Hanging manic manic
And the reason for this strange behavior
The mastermind in front of the line
I'm waiting for the sign

I'm the one please pick me
I'm the one please pick me
Et lux perpetua

True believers
Medicine receivers
Acting in panic panic
Enjoying the manic manic
There's a reason for this odd behavior
In the line the madman guides

One of a kind
The mastermind
Controlling panic panic
Calling for manic manic
The only reason for this mad behavior
The random mind of the mastermind
I'm waiting for the sign

I'm the one please pick me
I'm the one please pick me
Et lux perpetua

This is the hour the right time to take part in the gathering
And now sing a song for me and let your minds be free
Et lux perpetua

I'm the one please pick me
I'm the one please pick me
Et lux perpetua
