Lay it, lay it down
Let me see your hand
Show me what you got
You're always talking
But you're not playing

It doesn't match your face
Gotta find my way
Away from this place
Can you take me now?
I, I want it
I want it real
Are you afraid of me now?

Are you afraid of me now?
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it?
Do you feel back into your soul?
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it?

Do you feel the beat in your heart?
I, I want it
I want it real
Run away with me now
I, I want it
I want it real

Run away with me now
Some days i'm built of metal
I can't be broken
But not when i'm with you
You love me real
We have it all

Can't leave me now
As the way, you are to take
Run away with me now
Wind's in my hair
'Cause I don't care
Baby, run away with me now

Run away with me now
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it?
Do you feel back into your soul?
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it?

Do you feel the beat in your heart?
I, I want it
I want it real
Run away with me now
I, I want it
I want it real

Run away with me now
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Oh, oh
Drinking in the summer
I'm good at running
I'll beat you in the race again
Are you afraid?
Better make your way

It's easiest to stay at home
But then we taste it
We gotta have it
We have no control
Where is the love?
The kind we dream of
The kind that makes us young

The kind that makes us young

Don't leave me
Never leave me out
Don't leave me
Never leave me out
Don't leave me
Never leave me out
Don't leave me
Never leave me out
Don't leave me
Never leave me out
Don't leave me
Never leave me out
