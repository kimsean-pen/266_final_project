you've been watching while I
swam around
went in too deep
I nearly drowned

not much different from the
boy in the past
relation is new
I hope it will last

let us waste away the night
'cos flying on the ground is right
let us waste away the night
'cos flying on the ground is right
with you

I'm not tired
but the sun has set
we'll sleep together
but we won't sleep yet

we can burn without
no flames at all
when I'm with you
I'm ready to fall

let us waste away the night
'cos flying on the ground is right
let us waste away the night
'cos flying on the ground is right
with you
