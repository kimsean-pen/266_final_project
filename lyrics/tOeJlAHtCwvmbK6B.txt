Hey little girl, braids in your hair
Big bad world but you ain't scared, no
'Cause nobody's gone and told ya
To shut up, play nice, do what you're told
Marry into money and don't ever let him go
Is what they're gonna tell ya

'Cause it's two steps back and one step forward
The judge and the jury are workin' for each other
They ain't gonna tell you how to play the game

Little girl, don't ever let 'em keep you down
Little girl, dream bigger than they tell you how
Shake it up like a groundbreaker
Shatter ceilin's like a skyscraper
If they go low you go high

Don't ever let 'em make you feel little girl
A little girl
Don't ever let 'em make you feel little girl

Hey little girl, you're dressed to fit in
Look like a star but call it a sin, whoa
But they don't even know ya
He lied to your face even though you love him
You'll take the blame 'cause you had it comin'; whoa
But you never had it comin', no

Little girl, don't ever let 'em keep you down
Little girl, dream bigger than they tell you how
Shake it up like a groundbreaker
Shatter ceilin's like a skyscraper
If they go low you go high

Don't ever let 'em make you feel little girl
A little girl
Don't ever let 'em make you feel little girl

'Cause it's two steps back and one step forward
The judge and the are jury workin' for each other
They ain't gonna tell you how to play the game, yeah

Little girl, don't ever let 'em keep you down
Little girl, dream bigger than they tell you how
Shake it up like a groundbreaker
Shatter ceilin's like a skyscraper
If they go low you go high

Don't ever let 'em make you feel little girl
A little girl
No, don't ever let 'em make you feel little girl
Little girl
Don't ever let 'em make you feel little girl
Little girl
