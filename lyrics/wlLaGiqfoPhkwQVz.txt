Might be all out of money
But I'm all full of love
I might be all out of money
But I do what I want

If I'm forever high
They'll never see me low
Look like a dollar sign
I'm about to go

If our heart state was wilder
May fall out of my skin
If our head state was lighter
We'd be gone with the wind

If I'm forever high
They will never know

Run, run, dive into the floor
I could take you where the river go
Run, run, dive into the floor
I could take you where the river go
Run, run, dive into the floor
Run, run, dive into the floor
I could take you where the river go
I could take you where the river go
Take you where the river go

Might be all out of money
But you can't fight the sun
I might be all out of money
Cause the light's never gone

If I'm forever high
They will never know

Run, run, dive into the floor
I could take you where the river go
Run, run, dive into the floor
I could take you where the river
Take you where the river go
Take you where the river go

Run, run, dive into the floor Alejandro
I could take you where the river go
Run, run, dive into the floor
I could take you where the river
Take you where the river go
