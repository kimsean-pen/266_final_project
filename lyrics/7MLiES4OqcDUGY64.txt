Only now it's gone, i can see the year
See for what it was, and start another day
All the liberty you took, the love that you abused
The friends that you turned, against me if yoyu could
And you're twisting what i say, all that saying you were scared
It doesn't matter anymore, cos i'm not there
You were careless when the beat kicked in
And careless when it left, and careless all the way
I didn't see it till the end
I feel nothing when you cry
I hear nothing see no need to replay
I can smile now and turn away
Come overhere so you can see me walk away
And celebrate: the end of night, the end of night
The end of night, the end of night It
Only takes one lie to bring this house down
Behind closed doors, no one tells the first time round
The pain is worse when you bring it on yourself
The sweetest bully building, a love that couldn't last
You were ugly when the beat kicked in
And ugly when it left, and ugly all the way
Didn't see it till the end
I feel nothing when you cry
I hear nothing see no need to replay
I can smile now and turn away
Come overhere so you can see me walk away
And celebrate: the end of night, the end of night
The end of night, the end of night
After the fall comes love, i hate to hate and love to love
After the fall comes love, i hate to hate and love to love
I feel nothing when you cry
I hear nothing see no need to replay
I can smile now and turn away
Come overhere so you can see me walk away
And celebrate: the end of night, the end of night
The end of night, the end of night.
