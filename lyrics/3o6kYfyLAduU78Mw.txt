Trailing on the lawn
What was going on?
It all seemed so strange
Elements unwind
Thought of you as kind
But so out of range

Drifted to your head
Thought of you instead
It all made some sense
Peeled another layer
Keeping you aware
In a web so dense

Won't you come and see me?
I'll be fine
Tell yourself its still and I'm not trying

Seemingly afraid
We can't get it straight
But it seemed the same
Waiting for success
I been offered less
Does the trying pay?

Won't you come and see me?
I'll be fine
Running after everything in time

It's the long way to get to you
It's the wrong way to see the truth
It's a deep place I thought I knew
It's the long way to get to you

Won't you come and see me?
I'll be fine
Sealing us together one more time
