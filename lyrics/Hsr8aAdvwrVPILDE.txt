Let it go

We get a little faded the colors go
running out of all our clothes
and the flash dont light when the battery is low.
Well you can stamp a foot down through the floor
its a better plan by far
to blow off the roof and let in the dark
so we better get started
if I were you id let it go
and feel it all over inside like a chemical
cause to tell the truth I dont know
if its ever over

We don't need a cure for the weight of the world
cause its floating round in the universe
just swinging like its tied by a string that you hold
and let it go

We could dig a hole right down into
somewhere as deep as black and blue
and fill it with a crowd and the sound of right now
we could carve a tunnel under

And found just out how low it goes it goes
till we run out of dirt on the other side and we see the light
but if I were you
id look up
and find a place there in the sky were there's room enough
to spread it out
on the ground
for where you land when you come down

We don't need a cure for the weight of the world
cause its floating round in the universe
just swing it like its tied by a string that you hold
and let it go
Let it go
Let it go

Well you can stamp a foot down through the floor
its a better plan by far
to go off the roof and let in the dark
Let in the dark
Let in the dark

So we better get started, started, stated...
so we better get started, started, stated...

Let it go (started, stated...)
Let it go (started, stated...)

We don't need a cure for the weight of the world
cause its floating round in the universe
just swinging like its tied by a string that you hold
and let it go
Let it go
Let it go
