What a sight for my eyes
To see you in sleep.
Could it stop the sun rise
Hearing you weep?
You're not seen, you're not heard
But I stand by my word.
Came a thousand miles
Just to catch you while you're smiling.

What a day for laughter
And walking at night.
Me following after, your hand holding tight.
And the memory stays clear with the song that you hear.
If I can but make
The words awake the feeling.

What a reason for waiting
And dreaming of dreams.
So here's hoping you've faith in impossible schemes,
That are born in the sigh of the wind blowing by
While the dimming light brings the end to a night of loving.
