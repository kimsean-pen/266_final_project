Weh the bloodclat do you, siddung
Yuh, laughing, oh yah, yah, yah, yuh, Scarlxrd, yeah,
okay, okay, okay, aye, okay, yah, yah, yah (Laughing)

Watch me make my way to the top, I ain't stalling much
Motherfuckers always talking shit, I don't give a fuck
I-I-I'ma go 'head and go do me, I'ma run it up
Demons in my head making noise, wish they'd shut it up (Break)
Stay far from me
Life's fine, I've refreshed
Stop the talking, I ain't leave yet (Why?)
Boiling point, I'm 'bout to reach it
Aye, aye, boiling point, I'm 'bout to reach it
Aye, aye, boiling point, I'm 'bout to reach it

T-T-Twisted, how I think, yeah
Fucked up at the crib, yeah
Counting all my fifties
Still that British kid, yeah (Yeah)
Love does not exist, yeah
It's still fuck that bitch, yeah
I don't want no service, no
Just throw me in a ditch (Yeah)
Speaking on my name?
I don't post, I make 'em wait
I'm pretentious with my lane
I've got everlasting hate
Still moving forward (Yeah)
My mental is all aching, it's all good (Yeah)
They wanna know how I'm coping
I'm falling apart, this shit's torture
N-N-Nothing's really tragic when they sitting at the door
Anything can happen when your mind is not a flaw
Reconsider patterns that be flowing out your jaw
Go and live life to the fullest like fuck it then
Angels and demons don't love you no more
Clipped both your wings, now you're stuck on the floor
My soul bleeds, I blame all the running
Play me if that makes you feel something
Watch me make my way to the top, I ain't stalling much
Motherfuckers always talking shit, I don't give a fuck
I-I-I'ma go 'head and go do me, I'ma run it up
Demons in my head making noise, wish they'd shut it up (Break)
Stay far from me
Life's fine, I've refreshed
Stop the talking, I ain't leave yet (Why?)
Boiling point, I'm 'bout to reach it
Aye, aye, boiling point, I'm 'bout to reach it
Aye, aye, boiling point, I'm 'bout to reach it
