You want to sound off but you can't find the words to
Nothing makes sense in the way that it used to
Can't find the plus in the positive thinking
The well's run dry and you're not done drinking

Clouds start coming and the sky will fall
Clock ticks back from the bedroom wall
Now you're breathing
Just to make it through the night

All you need is the sunrise
Just a moment of dawn
If you're lost in the twilight
Close your eyes and move on

When you're tired in the waiting
Even though it's going to take you
A little more time, just a little more time
The sun's going to find you

Holding your days like a stack of paper
And you're chasing the wind as the pages scatter
You can save a few but you can't get them all back
So get up fast with your heart intact

Find yourself on the very edge
Lying awake in an empty bed
Now you're breathing
Just to make it through the night

All you need is the sunrise
Just a moment of dawn
If you're lost in the twilight
Close your eyes and move on

When you're tired in the waiting
Even though it's going to take you
A little more time, just a little more time
The sun's going to find you

Just a little more time
The sun's going to find you

Clouds start coming and the sky will fall
Clock ticks back from the bedroom wall
Now you're breathing
Just to make it through the night

All you need is the sunrise
Just a moment of dawn
If you're lost in the twilight
Close your eyes and move on

When you're tired in the waiting
Even though it's going to take you
A little more time, just a little more time
The sun's going to find you

Just a little more time
The sun's going to find you
