For my sins
I would leave a tear in laughter
With a grin
I regret what I have done
What should I do
To deserve you
Should I die to raise your smile

For every lie I told you
You're killing me darling
Killing me darling
I didn't want abuse your faith

For every time I doubt you
Punish me darling punish me darling
With every lie I did the same
I turned your heart to a grave

My little fear
Once I needed to betray you
You never grief
You're a rose without a thorn
What should I do
Did I lose you?
Should I leave it all behind?
