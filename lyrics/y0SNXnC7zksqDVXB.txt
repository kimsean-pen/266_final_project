Do you know
Do you know
You make me dream too much
Make me dream too much
And when i think of you
And when i think of

Pulled up?

Do you know
Do you know
You make me scream too much
Just silently
It's only too much
Far away is such a lonely place to be
Just, just be here with me
Just be here with me

Lyrics
(interpretation) do you know
Do you know
You make me dream too much
Make me dream too much
And when i think of you
And when i think of

Pulled up?

Do you know
Do you know
You make me scream too much
Just silently
It's only too much
Far away is such a lonely place to be
Just, just be here with me
Just be here with me
