In your message you said
You were going to bed
But I'm not done with the night

So I stayed up and read
But your words in my head
Got me mixed up so I turned out the light

And I, don't know how
To slow it down
My mind's racing
From chasing pirates

Well, I'm having the squeems
While the silliest thing's
Floppin' around in my brain

And I try not to dream
But them possible schemes
Swim around, wanna drown me in sync

And I don't know how
To slow it down
Oh, my mind's racing
From chasing pirates

And I don't know how
To slow it down
Oh, my mind's racing
From chasing pirates
My mind's racing
From chasing pirates
My mind's racing
From chasing pirates
