Mistakes our fathers made, will always be the same that we make
Oh, we never learn
We light up our hands and watch them burn

Hold on to your gold
Hold on to your gold
Hold on to your gold
When you find her, never let her go

It's such a lonely world, I found someone who made it all seem right again
But I let fear get in the middle and I ran and I stopped to look back

Hold on to your gold
Hold on to your gold
Hold on to your gold
When you find her, never let her go

Oh dreamer, I never should have let go of your hands
Oh dreamer, I swear I'll regret it for the rest of my days

Hold on to your gold
Hold on to your gold
Hold on to your gold
When you find her, never let her go
When you find her, never let her go
When you find her, never let her go
