Right, Wrong, what to do?
Some day it will come to you.
Hostile indians
We named a summer camp for you.

I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say

I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I'm in utter dismay
I've got nothing to say.

Harmless children
We named our soldiers after you.
Don't be a coconut
God is trying to talk to you.
We could drag it out
But that's for other bands to do.

I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say

I've got nothing to give
Got no reason to live
I will fight to survive
I got nothin to hide
Wish I wasn't so shy.
I'd like to watch
I'd like to read
I'd like a part
I'd like the lead
But I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to give
Got no reason to live
I will kill to survive
I got nothin to hide
Wish I wasn't so shy.
