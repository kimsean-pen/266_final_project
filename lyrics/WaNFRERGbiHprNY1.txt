Where to now?
Drifting his body
Cutting you down
And I can't pretend
His eyes don't burn,
Holes in your skin

Now all I see is the filth
In the hands of another man
His face in my thoughts,
My words become lost
And no longer make sense

Am I lost forever?
The damage has been done
For so long

How did you ever see me broken?
Well you forced me to find out everyday
Did you ever see me open?
Well you forced me to find out everyday

Nobody could,
Can you help this, no
The depths that I was brought up
The depths that I was brought up
Brought up

Oh well is it any wonder
Shallow is the way that I was born
Shallow is the way that I was born
The way that I was brought up, up
Tonight

Am I lost forever?
The damage has been done
For so long

How did you ever see me broken?
Well you forced me to find out everyday
Did you ever see me open?
Well you forced me to find out everyday

Oh pretty girl
Keep batting your eyes
'cause when you breathe you lie, lie
Oh pretty girl
You better think twice
'cause second chances are rarer than I

How can we forget who we have become
I'll give it all up.
Please wake up.
Every breathe you take, is a lie

How did you ever see me broken?
Well you forced me to find out everyday
Did you ever see me open?
Well you forced me to find out everyday
