How does it begin again?
How does it amaze?
Trusting abstraction
And it has ruined me

Seems I am afraid of it
An undesired effect
It resembled weakness
Mistaken for a strength

It did not come
Or else it never left

Gently turn the frame around
Let the water run
Keep the light on very late
No one bother anyone

Something passes over me
Cutting sharp and bright
Caught by my attention
I love the moment

None or too much
It is the same result

Fall asleep in your bed
Sleep until I'm up
I just want a clear head
Sun on my shoulder
