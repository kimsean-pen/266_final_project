Race of light
We're moving through the night
With destiny in our sights
We've got to fight

Through all the rain
We're masking all our pain
To take what still remains
Of our minds

Searching within
We've justified our sin
We're gonna take you on a ride
Till we find answers within

Location not clear
In shadows, we all disappear
Hold on, switch gears
We're gone as fast as we appeared

Gone as fast as we appear

Searching within
We've justified our sin
We're gonna take you on a ride
Till we find answers within

Location not clear
In shadows, we all disappear
Hold on, switch gears
We're gone as fast as we appeared

Gone as fast as we appeared
