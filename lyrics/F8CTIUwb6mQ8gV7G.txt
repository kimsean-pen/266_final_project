Walking down the street, man you're so bold (so bold)
Seen your mom & dad, & they're so cold (so cold)
Love will save your soul
Of feeling so alone & growing old

Come on up the stairs, man you got sold
Lost my train of thought, & now I'm told
That love will save your soul
Of feeling so alone & growing old
Love, love, love
Yeah love, love, love

Got a sneaking sense your hunt's for gold
Teachers cracking rules & now parole
Love will save your soul
Of feeling so alone & growing old
Love, love, love
Yeah, love, love, love

Love will always save your soul (your soul)
Love will always save your soul (your soul)
Love will save your soul
Love will save your soul
Love will always save your soul
Love will always save your soul
Love will save your soul
Love will save your soul

Love will always save your soul
Love will always save your soul
Love will save your soul
Love will save your soul
