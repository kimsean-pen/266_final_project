A ship is safe in harbour but thats not what ships are for
We left our homes and families in search of something more
Cause they say it's always darkest just before dawn
And they say it's always peaceful right before the storm

So now take this as a word of warning
It's getting darker when it should be dawning
The fire's burning out, the ending in sight
Please, tell we ain't going out without a fight

Well, we may not have much but we do have each other
With loyalty in our hearts, we look out for one another
We can't control the wind but we can adjust the sail
Life ain't always on our side but we will never fail

Abandon ship! No turning back
Abandon ship! All out attack
Abandon ship! It's sink or swim
Abandon ship! Born to loose and live to win!

All we left behind is a pile of enemies
Left them to stew in their own boiling blood
What we miss the most is our own kind, our families
We will always remember with honour and love

Abandon ship - No turning back!
Abandon ship - All out attack
Abandon ship - It's sink or swim
Abandon ship - Born to fight the devil within!
