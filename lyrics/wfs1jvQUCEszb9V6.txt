Coo coo ca choo baby you that's what you are
You are a Hollywood star you're the high priestess by far
And you know this tune's for you we call it Coo Coo Ca Choo
And it's a very brief description of the things we could do to you

Your body is incredible.

You were lookin' at me I was l lookin' at you
Coo coo ca choo coo coo ca choo
You were l lookin' at me I was lookin' at you
Coo coo ca choo now whatcha gonna do?

You were lookin' at me I was l lookin' at you
Coo coo ca choo coo coo ca choo
You were l lookin' at me I was lookin' at you
Coo coo ca choo now whatcha gonna do?

Oil me up quick Miss Daisy before I'm lubin' up your tailpipe
Or the bedposts will be a knockin' and a knockin' 'til the break of light
Raised and dazed in a million and one ways
Like a Morton's coffee roll I want you hot and glazed
You're not the real thing baby you're Parkay you're not butter
Gonna have to get you home and lube you up with Fluffernutter
Scope it scope it baby lookin' so fit
Playin' games and layin' dames you know I know you know it
Quick to get the condom you know the Jimmy fits too snug
Lean you against the fireplace and ride you on the bearskin rug
Chow down my Ding Dong come and sing-a-long
Slip a grip around my tip and then you'll be my Klingon
Now in my sweatpants you're gonna see my erection
Ooh oh pick a de pop pop Perfection
Umpla dumpla dippedee do
'Cause I'd never leave the house if Mommy looked like you

You were lookin' at me I was l lookin' at you
Coo coo ca choo coo coo ca choo
You were l lookin' at me I was lookin' at you
Coo coo ca choo now whatcha gonna do?

You were lookin' at me I was l lookin' at you
Coo coo ca choo coo coo ca choo
You were l lookin' at me I was lookin' at you
Coo coo ca choo now whatcha gonna do?

Butter up butter cup did ya really think it would really last that long?
My attention span hutches and when you wake up you know that I'll be gone
Cocoa butter beach blonde wearin' that thin thong
You know I got a thing for you it's only an inch long
Pickin' up your signals like you're a T.V. station
I'm lookin' for the channel to have immoral applications
Lookin' so fine Cosmo behind
Fermentation of time like Riunite wine
Well I'm bubblin' up and steamin' like an active volcano
I think I clogged up all your pipes better get yourself some Drano
I get annoyed 'cause I can't avoid
Baby sounding like a mongoloid
I gots the skills to keep ya busy all night
If you do not bite I hope you blow like dynamite
Happy Thanksgiving would you like a little white meat?
I'll stuff my Butterballs then you can eat

You were lookin' at me I was l lookin' at you
Coo coo ca choo coo coo ca choo
You were l lookin' at me I was lookin' at you
Coo coo ca choo now whatcha gonna do?

You were l lookin' at me I was lookin' at you
Coo coo ca choo now whatcha gonna do?
