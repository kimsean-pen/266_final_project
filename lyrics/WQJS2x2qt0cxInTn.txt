Once when I saw her there
White light she stood so still
Warming her eyes to the sea
Hardly her way to be free

Auburn and ivory
Heart break and pony tails

Holding her bones by a fire
writing the letter she sails
white page turns golder lights
wanting her one sacrifice

auburn and ivory
heart break and pony tails

come to me
and I'll tell you what's wrong
she said, "I'll wait for you. I'll wait for..."

Once when I saw her there
white light she stood so still
white page turns golder lights
hardly her one sacrifice

auburn and ivory
heart break and pony tails
