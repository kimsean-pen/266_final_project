Out in the barnyard
The chickens do their number
Out in the barnyard
The cook is chopping lumber

Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh

Jump in the pigpen
Next time I'll take my shoes on
Hit the dirt to two and a half
Next time I'll leave my hat off

Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
