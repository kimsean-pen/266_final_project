I was dreamin' when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this mornin'
Could've sworn it was judgment day

The sky was all purple
There were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction
You know I didn't even care

Say say
Two-thousand-zero-zero party over
Oops out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999

(I was dreaming' when I wrote this)
(So sue me if I go too fast)
(Life is just a party, and parties weren't meant to last)
War is all around us, my mind says prepare to fight
So if I gotta die I'm gonna listen to my body tonight

Yeah

They say two-thousand-zero-zero party over
Oops out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
Yeah, Yeah

Lemme tell ya something
If you didn't come to party
Don't bother knockin' on my door
I got a lion in my pocket
And baby he's ready to roar
Yeah, yeah
Everybody's got a bomb
We could all die any day
Ooow
But before I'll let that happen
I'll dance my life away

Oh, they say
Two thousand-zero-zero-party over
Oops out of time
We're runnin' outta time
(Tonight I'm gonna)
So tonight we gonna
(Party like it's 1999)
We gonna, oww

Say it 1 more time
Two-thousand-zero-zero party over oops
Out of time
No, no (Tonight I'm gonna)
Yeah, yeah
So tonight we gonna (party like it's 1999)
We gonna, oww

Alright, it's 1999
You say it, 1999
1999
1999
Don't stop, don't stop, say it one more time
Two-thousand-zero-zero party over, oops out of time
Yeah, yeah (Tonight I'm gonna)
So tonight we gonna (party like it's 1999)
We gonna, oww
Yeah
Don'tcha wanna go (1999)
Don'tcha wanna go (1999)
We could all die any day (1999)
I don't wanna die
I'd rather dance my life away (1999)
Listen to what I'm tryin' to say
Everybody, everybody say party
C'mon now, you say party
That's right, everybody say (Party)
Can't run from the revelation, no (Party)
Sing it for your nation y'all
Tell me what you're singin', baby say (Party)
Telephone's a-ringin', mama (Party)
C'mon, c'mon, you say (Party)
Everybody, (Party)
Work it down to the ground, say (Party, Party)
Come on, take my body, baby (Party)
That's right, c'mon, sing the song (Party)

That's right (Party)
Got a lion in my pocket mama, say (Party)
Oh, and he's ready to roar (Party)

Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb
