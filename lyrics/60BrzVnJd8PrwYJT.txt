Did you ever love me
Biopsy from the origin of sound
Confirms you're speaking truthfully
Concludes everything I thought about
Is this past or present
I can't seem to make it all out
What truths but shall I find in the heat of the moment
Betrayal, what have I done now
You think we can make it
Well I wish I felt the same way I did then
Homesick, just waiting
To return to you and your hand
Is this past or present
I can't seem to make it all out
What truths but shall I find in the heat of the moment
Betrayal, what have I done now
it's not like me to forgive and move on
oh it's
Looking back on my mistakes saying others
Too destined to see where I went wrong
well
You say this is forever
You told me this is forever
Say this is forever
Tell me this is forever
Say this is forever
Tell me this is forever
