Sometimes it's easy
It's meant to be
I dream of the moments
You'll be with me

'Cause I wanna look down now
I wanna get deeper
Can you let me in?

To show me places
To be my keeper
I'm waiting for my seraphim

Oh, I'm lookin' for an angel
For an angel
Lookin' for an angel

Yeah, I'm lookin' for an angel
For an angel
Lookin' for an angel

My heart is ready
My mind is open
My body is aching
I'll wait for you

'Cause I wanna rise up now
Don't wanna be earth-bound
Reach up to the sky

Into the distance
And the future
Is waiting for me in your arms

Lookin' for an angel
For an angel
Lookin' for an angel

Yeah, I'm lookin' for an angel
For an angel
Lookin' for an angel
(I'm waitin', I'm waitin')

Lookin' for an angel
For an angel
Lookin' for an angel

Yeah, I'm lookin' for an angel
For an angel
Lookin' for an angel

And when good things are good
I want to share them
I don't want to be alone

And when darkness falls
Will you hear my call
And show me the way back home

'Cause I want this life
To be twice as nice
With somebody by my side

Soon I dream of things
Like your golden wings
When you carry me and fly

'Cause I wanna look down now
I wanna get deeper
Can you let me in?

To show me places
To be my keeper
I'm waiting for my seraphim

I'm lookin' for an angel
For an angel
Lookin' for an angel

Yeah, I'm lookin' for an angel
For an angel
Lookin' for an angel

Oh, I'm lookin' for an angel
For an angel
Lookin' for an angel
(I'm waitin', I'm waitin')

Yeah, I'm lookin' for an angel
For an angel
Lookin' for an angel
(I'm waitin', I'm waitin')

I'm waitin, I'm waitin for you
