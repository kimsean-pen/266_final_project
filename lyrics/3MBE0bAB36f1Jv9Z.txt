Invitations to my party
Send Jones an inviting card
He got his mean streak from the gutter
Got his kindness from God

Now tugboats paint the river
Carry coal to the city in white dock liners
Happiness on the uptown side
At my party in the morning tide

Ooh, la, la, la, blackpatch
Ooh, la, la, la, blackpatch
Ooh, la, la, la, blackpatch
In blackpatch, in blackpatch

Clothespins on wash ropes
Window to window tie
Socks and bells and nightgowns
Tassels in the morning, tassels in the morning sky

People, are you ready?
(Ready, ready)
People, are you trying?

Ready, ready, ready, ready
(Ready, I'm ready)
I'm ready, I'm ready

Womanchild on the side street
Flashing in blackpatch
Lipstick on her reefer
Waiting for a match
