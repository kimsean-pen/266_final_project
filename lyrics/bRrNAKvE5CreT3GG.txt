A billion people died on the news tonight
but not so many cried at the terrible sight
well mama said, "it's just make believe,
you can't believe everything you see
so baby, close your eyes to the lullabies
on the news tonight"

Who's the one to decide that it would be alright?
To put the music behind the news tonight?
well Mama said, "you cant believe everything you hear
the diagetic world is so unclear so baby, close your ears
on the news tonight, on the news tonight
The unobtrusive tones on the news tonight."

And Mama said, mmmmm-mmmmm
"Why don't the newscasters cry when they read about people who die?
At least they could be decent enough to put just a tear in their eyes"
and Mama said, "it's just make believe you can't believe everything you see
so baby, close your eyes to the lullabies on the news tonight."
