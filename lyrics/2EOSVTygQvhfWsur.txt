Don't you pretend
That I'm not alive
My bones never ache
Unless she's nearby
Where is your face
In a safe of dead tongues
I can see your reflection
In your totem firstborn
I suspect
You've been carrying a pack of wolves
I regret
Not killing you while I had the chance
(I know I had the chance
I know I had)

Maybe I will always haunt you
Mark the somnolence with truth
Better hang your dead palace
Than have a living home to lose
In the river Ganges God damns my name

Don't let these hands
Sharpen your eyes
(A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands
Sharpen your eyes
(A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands
Sharpen your eyes
(A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands
Sharpen your eyes
(A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands
Sharpen your eyes
(A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands
Sharpen your eyes
(A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands
Sharpen your eyes
(A rasp of tails)
