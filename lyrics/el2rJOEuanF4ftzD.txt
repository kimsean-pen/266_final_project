If it's broken, I don't fix it
I'll buy a brand new one instead
With wine and beer all mixed in
To keep the noise outside my head

So carry on this wasteful mission
Carry on, keep havin' fun
Until the mental solution saves us
I'll close my eyes and carry on

I'm not a chemist, doctor or technician
Though I wish I had those skills
But I don't have too much ambition
As long as I can pay my bills

So carry on this wasteful mission
Carry on, keep havin' fun
Carry on with no traditions
Until the mental solution saves us
I'll close my eyes and carry on

Carry on, carry on
Carry on, carry on

Whoa, I hear the clock is tickin'
Could this be the last call?
My cylinders are only clickin'
Under the influence of alcohol

Carry on, this wasteful mission
Carry on, keep havin' fun
Carry on with old traditions
Until the mental solution saves us
I'll close my eyes and carry on

Carry on, carry on
Carry on, carry on
