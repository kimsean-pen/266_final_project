Man I've been fearless, I let 'em feel this
You know I spit it, no cap when I kill this
I'm bouta hit 'em with the raps, let 'em hear this
Swear this world tour, bouta be a field trip, yuh
Stack it up and then I double it
No time for mumbling
Show 'em where trouble is
Been on my team, plotting my things
Living my dreams, yeah it's obscene

Word around here, been blessed
Everything you hear my best
The game looks clear, no tests
Won't stop til my peers SESH
Won't stop, won't stop, no I don't rest
All you wanna talk about is how rich you are
Made 1 million, bought 50 cars
Your label sucks, stuck in the 360

Not Harrison but I'm still indie

Absurd, yeah I'm a man of my word
The music finally bouta burst
They wanted me dead in a hearse
They wanna copy how I work
I hit 'em like "yeah good luck"
From the sun up to the moon up
I made tracks on tracks, that views up

All these rappers lying, with their ruse up
I am not one of them, don't confuse us

Man I've been fearless, I let 'em feel this
You know I spit it, no cap when I kill this
I'm bouta hit 'em with the raps, let 'em hear this
Swear this world tour, bouta be a field trip, yuh
Stack it up and then I double it
No time for mumbling

Show 'em where trouble is
Been on my team, plotting my things
Living my dreams, yeah it's obscene

Been that lost boy, but I'm still here
Crawling up, ain't got no fears
Put me on the map and imma show 'em rap
All that fake stuff, got no time for that
And my pain, turned it into a new outlook and lane
Really bout the winning and putting to shame
Show 'em more fire, it's burning for days
Music just won't be the same
They just want to see me fail
Every time I will avail

All their music sounding stale
My music the holy grail
Been too long to quit, I made too many waves, yuh
Bouta feel the bliss when I step foot on stage, ay

Man I've been fearless, I let 'em feel this
You know I spit it, no cap when I kill this
I'm bouta hit 'em with the raps, let 'em hear this
Swear this world tour, bouta be a field trip, yuh

Stack it up and then I double it
No time for mumbling
Show 'em where trouble is
Been on my team, plotting my things
Living my dreams, yeah it's obscene

Fearless, I let 'em feel this
You know I spit it, no cap when I kill this
I'm bouta hit 'em with the raps, let 'em hear this
Swear this world tour, bouta be a field trip, yuh
Stack it up and then I double it
No time for mumbling
Show 'em where trouble is
Been on my team, plotting my things
Living my dreams, yeah it's obscene
