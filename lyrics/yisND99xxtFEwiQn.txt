In the dark, it's just you and I
There's not a sound, there's not one sigh
Just the beat of my poor heart
In the dark

Now, in the dark, I get such a thrill
When he puts his fingertips upon my lips
And he begs me, "Please, please, be still"
In the dark

But soon this dance will be ending
And you're gonna find, you're gonna be missed
Gee, but I'm not pretending
'Cause I swear, I swear, it's fun
It's fun, it's fun to be kissed in the dark

Now, we will find
What the rest what the rest have left behind
Just let them dance 'cause we'll find romance
In the dark

In the dark, I get such a thrill
When he puts his fingertips on my lips
And he begs me to "Please, be still, be still"
In the dark

Oh, but soon this dance will be ending
And you're gonna be missed
Gee, but I'm not pretending
'Cause I swear, I swear, it's fun
It's fun, fun to be kissed in the dark

Now, we will find
What the rest what the rest have left behind
Just let them dance 'cause we'll find romance
In the dark, yes
