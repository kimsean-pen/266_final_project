Saw you say, "I love you today"
I'm a child, took you no way
Hold me close, don't let me be
I'm afraid of almost everything
I need a friend

Wanted to give you a call
I can't leave my home at all
I feel so scared inside
All I do is cry
Of love

I wanted to give you a call
I can't leave my home at all
The only thing I know
I don't know what to show
Again

Took my dogs to my mom
Told my brother, "so long"
I don't think I can take no more
In my mind, I'm such a bore

I wanted to give you a call
I can't leave my home at all
The only thing I know
The only thing I know
Is you

Take my dogs to my mom
My brother, "so long."
