Can you make it real?
Make it more than real, more than just feel
We are on a ride
We're on it all the time to the front of your mind

My stepfather looks
Just like David Bowie but he hates David Bowie
I think Bowie's cool
I think Lodger rules, my stepdad's a fool

Without me there's nothing
I'm the only thing that dies
If it came down to your life or mine
I would do the stupid thing

And let you keep on living
And let you keep on living
And let you keep on living
And let you keep on living

"I'm alright," said the man to his wife
Waking up to a head full of bed, full of what she said
She hadn't thought of it for a while
And when she did, she thought of it differently than she thought she should be thinking

Just the thought of it's enough
To penetrate my comfort zone

Without me there's nothing
I'm the only thing that dies
If it came down to your life or mine
I would do the stupid thing

And let you keep on living
And let you keep on living
And let you keep on living
And let you keep on living
