I said
Baby, come up to my office
You played at my party
I owe you some money
You owe me your lips
I'm going to give tips
I heard your boyfriend is out of town

Baby, aren't you hungry?
I could get codeine
Or go get my car keys
Oh, what a cute dress
Right now its useless
I heard your boyfriend is out of town

And you should get out of town too
Yeah, you should get out of town too

I said
Baby, I know that you want me
You won't regret this
Really, I'm serious
We could just have fun
We're only young ones
I know your boyfriend is out of town

Baby, where are you going?
Don't be such a diva
You know you can't leave now
Oh, what a cute dress
Oh, what a wet mess
I know your boyfriends is out of town
