Pistol of fire
Pistol of fire
Pistol of fire
Shattered the frame

Go hug your sister
Go love your sister
Go hug your sister
One and the same

Higher, where did you want to take me?
Higher, where did you want to go?
Higher, grabbing up the money it's coming
Higher, coming for that rooftop door

I feel the water
Out in the cool grass
Down in the meadow
Under the tree

It's gonna tickle
You're gonna giggle
It's gonna tickle
Pick up her feet

Higher, where did you want to take me?
Higher, where did you want to go?
Higher, grabbing up the money it's coming
Higher, coming for that rooftop door
