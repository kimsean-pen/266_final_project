La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you wanna start something new
And it's breaking my heart you're leaving
Baby I'm grieving
And if you wanna leave take good care
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there

Uh, baby-baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Uh, baby-baby it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child girl

You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
'Cause I never want to see you sad, girl
Don't be a bad girl
But if you wanna leave take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
Just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

Uh, baby-baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Uh, baby-baby it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child girl

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Baby, I love you

But if you wanna leave take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
Just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

Uh, baby-baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Uh, baby-baby it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you
Like a child girl
Oh, yeah!
Uh, baby-baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Uh, baby-baby it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you
Like a child girl
