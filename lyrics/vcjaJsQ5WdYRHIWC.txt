A clock ticks on the wall
A knife spins in the Dark
He's closing his eyes for the last Time
He's going to be her

They might hate you, but I love you
And they can go kill themself
They might hate you, but I love you
And they can go kill themself

Let me let me see who you are
Let me let me see who you are

A clock ticks on the wall
She loves another girl
She open her eyes for the first Time
She's going to love her

They might hate you, but I love you
And they can go kill themself
They might hate you, but I love you
And they can go kill themself

Let me let me see who you are
Let me let me see who you are

A clock ticks on the wall
A knife spins in the Dark
A clock ticks on the wall
A knife spins in the Dark
A clock ticks on the wall
A knife spins in the Dark

Let me let me see who you are
Let me let me see who you are
see who you are
see who you are
