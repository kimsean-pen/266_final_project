Once upon a time
Science opened up the door
We would feed the hungiy fields
Tilll they could'nt eat no more

But the potion that we made
Touched the creatures down below
And they grew up in a way
That we'd never seen before
Supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature

They were angry with the man
Cause he changed their way of life
And they take their sweet revenge
As they trample throught the night

For a hundred miles or more
You could hear the people cry
But there 's nothing you can do
Even god is on their side

Supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature

How can I explain
Things are different today
Darkness all around
and nobody makes a sound
Such a sad affair
No one seems to care
Supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature
supernature supernature supernature...

Better watch out
There's no way to stop it now
You can't escape it's too late
Look what you've done
There's no place that you can run
The monsters made, we must pray
supernature ...supernature supernature

Maybe nature has a plan
To control the way of man
He must start from scratch again
Many battles he must win
Till he earns his place on earth
Like the other creatures do
Will there be a happy end
Now that all depends on you
Supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature
