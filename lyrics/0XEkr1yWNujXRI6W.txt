I think I feel a little hurt
My fists are turning coal to diamonds
Why no one told me so much work
Would all go into tryin'?
Oh, but those feelings ain't the same
How some things never change
Well, nobody's perfect
And I knew better
Anyway

I thought about it 'til my head hurt
I thought about it but it only made things worse
I thought about it 'til my head hurt
I thought about it but it only made things worse

So I was wrong
What could I do?
I knew all along
