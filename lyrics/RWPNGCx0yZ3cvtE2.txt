Everybody wants to be Hollywood
The fame, the vanity, the glitz, the stories
One day I'll become a great big star you know
Like the big dipper
And maybe one day you can visit my condo
On the big hill you know like 90210
Just imagine my face in the magazine's
People analyzing my look
My body or any plastic surgery you know
Like the big dipper
And maybe one day you can shake my hand
On the planet Hollywood
You say I'm not underground
I'm rich, I'm famous, I vanish, I'm glitz
I am the story, an' I am the star you know
Like the big dipper
