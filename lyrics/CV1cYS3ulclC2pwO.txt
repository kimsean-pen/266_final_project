You'll never know how much I really love you
You'll never know how much I really care

Listen
Do you want to know a secret
Do you promise not to tell
Whoa whoa-oa
Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you
Oo-ooh oo-ooh ooh

Do you want to know a secret

Say the words you long to hear

I've known a secret for a week or two
Nobody knows
Just we two
