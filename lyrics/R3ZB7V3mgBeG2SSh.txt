You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry
It's through
Ohhhhh, oh ohhh
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wond'ring why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no

Not a second time
···
You know you made me cry

I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you
Ooh, oooooh, ooh, oooh, yeah
And now you've changed your mind

I see no reason to change mine
I cry
It's through
Ohhhhh, oh ohhh
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wond'ring why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no
Not a second time
Not a second time
Not a second ti'e
No, no, no, no, no
(Not a second time) No, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
