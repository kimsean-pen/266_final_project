You've been telling lies that I can see
Fairy tales that build inside of me
You keep tellin me
It's time we both see
You're lost yes, I'm free

You've been running wild, but not for me
I feel just like a child that cannot see
Your voice waking me
Saying I should see
You're lost, well I'm free

Fade away; I think that somethin' strange is wrong
I try to see, but still I feel, you are gone
I think I should see
When you said to me
You're lost, yeah and I'm free
Ya know I'm free
I'm so free
