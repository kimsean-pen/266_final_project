Take me home
Take me home
And the streetlights light, light up
To take me home
I love you Chicago
You make feel some summer fling
You know that I know that I owe you everything
I love you Chicago

Feel the sorrow, hit the bottle
Feel the rush of having no tomorrow
She said, You gotta find yourself
Something worth holding onto (onto)

You charged me up, char-charged me up
I was something made for God to label fragile, now I'm stuck
And you know too much, know, know too much
You're the one true thing
You're the one

Take me home
Take me home
And the streetlights light, light up
To take me home
I love you Chicago
You make feel some summer fling
You know that I know that I owe you everything
I love you Chicago

And I'm just living out a suitcase
Watch me now, watch me as I drive away
I'm supposed to leave you at the end
Of the season but I'll stay (I'll stay)
I'll stay (I'll stay)

You charged me up, char-charged me up
I was something made for God to label fragile, now I'm stuck
And you know too much, know, know too much
You're the one true thing
You're the one

Take me home
Take me home
And the streetlights light, light up
To take me home
I love you Chicago
You make feel some summer fling
You know that I know that I owe you everything

Take me home
Take me home
And the streetlights light, light up
To take me home
I love you Chicago
You make feel some summer fling
You know that I know that I owe you everything
I love you Chicago
