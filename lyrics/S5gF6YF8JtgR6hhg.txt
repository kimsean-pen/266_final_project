I woke up
To the sound
Of a man who's always been
But never been around
And he told me
How to change my ways
And stop with childish games
So I told the man 'No'
I'm never ever gonna change
This's who I am
Gonna feel my own pain
Haven't been here in years
And it's not your choice
Gonna do what I want
'Cause I'm not a little boy
I get higher
I get higher
I'm gonna set this house on fire
Shut off the lights, I hear your sound
I'm locking the door as you fall to the ground
I get higher
I get higher
The sun is shining, I'm on fire
I walk the streets, I hear no sounds
My shiny blue eyes turn to painful brown

In the park where I sat down
Saw the payphones ringing so I answer the sound
I need another quarter
Man keeps on talking
Don't know where it went
Must've lost it in my pocket
I get higher
I get higher
I'm gonna set this house on fire
Shut off the lights, I hear your sound
I'm locking the door as you fall to the ground
Gonna get higher, ooh
Gonna get higher, alright
I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
And I can't take it all
(Oh, oh oh oh oh) Alright
(Oh, oh oh oh oh) Oh yeah
(Oh, oh oh oh oh) Yeah oh
(Oh, oh oh oh oh) Here we go
I get higher
I get higher
I'm gonna set this house on fire
Shut off the lights, I hear your sound
I'm locking the door as you fall to the ground
I get higher
I get higher
I'm gonna set this house on fire
I walk the streets, I hear no sounds
My shiny blue eyes turn to painful brown
Oh, yeah, alright
I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
And I can't take it all
