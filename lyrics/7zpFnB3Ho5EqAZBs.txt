Ooo ooo ooo ooo
You're a lost bird
Invisible falcon
Clipped wings flying over ghost mountains
I got you baby, got your back baby
I got you baby, got your back baby

You're an outlaw with no identity
You want more but you ain't got no money
I got you baby, got your back baby
I got you baby, got your back baby

I'm your opportunity
Don't you give up, don't you don't you give up

Here you're warm
So don't fly south
No, don't fly south
Stay in my heart
I am your green card
I am your green card
So stay with me Little wing
Flew into a window
Seeing stars but the stripes are out of reach, so
I picked you up baby, always pick you up baby
I picked you up baby, always pick you up baby

I'm your opportunity
Don't you give up, don't you don't you give up
Don't you give up, don't you don't you give up
Baby it's okay to fall for me
Gotta give in, gotta gotta give in
