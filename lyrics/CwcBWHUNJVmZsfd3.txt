Immaculate, flawless pride, the
accuser of their brethren has
accused again, an unerring
throw of guilt without sin...
To and fro, up and down.

Infallible, sovereign glory, O
angelic serpent who filled the
breadth of the world with tyrants
- Come forth! Wash me in the
glare of thy shameless perfection.

Violent prayers, roaring psalms,
I have no voice but that of homage
for Thee, Yes, my doubt is an
open wound, yet my conviction
the salt within.

Sword of faith, breastplate of
rightousness, garments of
vengeance, locust and the helmet of Salvation.

Naked splendour, pain divine,
each breath is a cry to be sifted,
sifted as wheat! Sifted as wheat!
Wood to the pyre, sifted as wheat!

Scorched lungs, solemn bene-
diction, I shall make mountains
bleed for thy holy mission.

Sword of faith, breastplate of
rightousness, garments of
vengeance, locust and the helmet
of Salvation.
...And he hath put a new song
in my mouth, even praise unto
our God: many shall see it, and
fear, and shall trust in the LORD!
