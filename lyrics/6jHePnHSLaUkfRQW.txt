I have no space
No room to move around
And this box is getting smaller
I'm trying to get out

How did I get so far
From where I was
When did I decide
To lose my way
Who have I become

I've got a new low
All 52 cards in a row
I see now that I won't let go
No I won't let go

Well who am I?
A cold shoulder left to cry
You feel bow-wow so do I
Yeah so do I

I've been right; I've been left
I've been wrong; I've been left behind
I've been up but mostly down

I've been right; I've been left
I've been wrong; I've been left behind
I've been up but mostly down

I can not help feeling like
I have so much at steak
So I lock myself inside my head
And I just run in place

So many directions I don't
Know which way to go
I'm so busy doing nothing
I got nothing to show

I've got a new low
All 52 cards in a row
I see now that I won't let go
No I won't let go

Well who am I?
A cold shoulder used to cry
You feel bow-wow so do I
Yeah so do I

I've been right; I've been left
I've been wrong; I've been left behind
I've been up but mostly down

I've been right; I've been left
I've been wrong; I've been left behind
I've been up but mostly down

I make mistakes
Just like everybody else
But instead I'm letting go of it
I can't forgive myself

Well I did my time
In the window of this box
Like it or not
All I got now is today
Tomorrow aint here
And yesterday is gone dead on me anyway
I've been right; I've been left
I've been wrong; I've been left behind
I've been up but mostly down
I've been right; I've been left
I've been wrong; I've been left behind
I've been up but mostly down
I've been right; I've been left
I've been wrong; I've been left behind
I've been up but mostly down
I've been right; I've been left
I've been wrong; I've been left behind
I've been up but mostly down
