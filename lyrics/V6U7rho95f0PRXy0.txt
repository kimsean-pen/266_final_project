No name, no worth
No name, no worth
No name, no worth, no more apologies
Nothing makes me love you
No name, no worth, no more apologies
I could never be forever

Been telling myself "I'm a freak" since I was six
Should've known that I'd turn out like this
Call me "deranged", call me "mister no name"
I'm the static peering from the back row, -ow, -ow
Hollow from the inside out
Skin shielding my seclusive bones
I'm better off torn apart
Alone in pieces, in peace when alone

I'll put a gun to my head
Replace my memories with lead
Replace my memories with lead
I'll put a gun to my head
Replace my memories with lead
Replace my memories with lead

Oh, here we go again
Been feeling like a freak ever since I was six
Twenty-something years later I still feel like shit
You want my insides on the fucking outside
A Bastard from birth, just a frame with no worth
Zero sorrow, zero grievance
Emotion's null, I've lost all feeling
When I'm awake I'd rather be dreaming
Sleepless nights, it's hurricane season

Can you hear that?
That's the sound of me not giving a fuck, oh

No name, no worth
No name, no worth
