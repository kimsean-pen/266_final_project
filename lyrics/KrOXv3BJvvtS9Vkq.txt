Inhale
With this desert night
We move
When the day grows old
We feel
Safer without lights
As the night grows

Exhale
What you've done today
These winds
Steer the dune's flow
It sweeps
And it strips away
And the night slows

Nightrunner
See how darkness holds all the color
Discover
What we can hide from one another

Nightrunner
See how darkness holds all the color
Hunter
You're not the same as all the others

Breathe
Dawn is on our heels
Reveals
What's been laying low
You see
It's harder to conceal
What the light shows

Nightrunner
See how darkness holds all the color
Recover
From one another

Nightrunner
See how darkness holds all the color
My brother
You're just the same as all the others
