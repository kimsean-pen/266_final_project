i don't wanna leave you on the farm
i don't wanna leave you on the farm
i don't wanna go
oh, just so ya know
i don't wanna leave you on the farm
days go by
and i'm still high
but you know
i'm thinkin' about you
corn's turned brown
the eves fall to the ground
it's a sound that reminds
me of you

i don't wanna leave you on the farm
i don't wanna leave you on the farm
i don't wanna go
oh, just so ya know
i don't wanna leave you on the farm

no telephone
to call you at home

i'm alone
on the throne
go get somethin'
hey, thanks for nothin'
i'll keep truckin'
and gettin' myself stoned

i don't wanna leave you on the farm
i don't wanna leave you on the farm
i don't wanna go
oh, just so ya know
i don't wanna leave you on the farm

days go by
and i'm still high
but you know
i'm thinkin' about you
corn's turned brown
the eves fall to the ground
it's a sound that sticks
like glue.
