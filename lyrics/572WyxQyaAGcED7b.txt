We don't know where this is going now
But I'm feeling love for you
I'm feeling something new, yea-yeah
We don't know where this is going now
But don't be afraid tonight
Don't be afraid of heights, no-o
Let me open your heart wi-i-ide

When your angels fall out of the sky
I'll be the wings that make you fly
When you come down, I'll take you high
I'll take you high
I'll take you
I'll take you

If I'm dreaming, don't roll over yet
Perfect like porcelain
This could be heaven sent, yea-yeah
Kiss the wind and just hold on to me
'Cause in the free-fall is when we get to live again, yea-yeah
Let me open your heart wi-i-ide

When your angels fall out of the sky
I'll be the wings that make you fly
When you come down, I'll take you high
I'll take you high
I'll take you
I'll take you
I'll take you

When we feel down and we're lost and we're wasting away
Let's escape
There's a place deep in your heart where the trouble can't go
That's our home, yea-yeah
Yea-yeah, yea-yeah, yea-yeah, yea-yeah, yea-yeah, yea-yeah

I'll take you
I'll take you
I'll take you
