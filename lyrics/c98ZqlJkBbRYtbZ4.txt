All night, I dream of water
That can wash the weight of the world from my shoulders
All night, I dream of water
That can wash the weight of the world from my shoulders

Hands of the new one, we need you so
To make way for the new born, to be king again

All night an, endless fire
Wanting to only fly away, grow older

No escape, no escape
Please pray this is just a dream
Just a dream
Fight fire with fire
This is coming clean, coming clean
These are the words

These are the words of my holiday, craving the sea, that honest place
Soothe my mind, with everything honest, yeah give me my solace
Soothe my mind, with everything honest, yeah give me my

All night, I dream of forever
Hiding myself from the world, thats grown colder

I wanna be stronger than oceans
I wanna lift mountains high
Bring back glory to your name
I wanna move faster than time

I wanna be stronger than oceans
I wanna lift mountains high
Bring back glory to your name
I wanna move faster than time

Mountains, oceans, I wanna see waves!

These are the words of my holiday
Craving the sea, that honest place
Soothe my mind
With everything honest
Yeah give me my solace
Soothe my mind, with everything honest
Yeah give me my
All night, all night
I dream of water, to fight the fire
Am I awake? Cause I wanna see waves!
