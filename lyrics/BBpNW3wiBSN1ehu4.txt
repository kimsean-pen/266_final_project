Somewhere
Over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land
That I heard of once
In a lullaby

Somewhere
Over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And those dreams
That you dared to dream
They really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And I'll wake
Where the clouds are far behind me
Oh yes
Where troubles melt
Like lemmon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Gonna be somewhere
Over the rainbow
Where pretty little blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then oh why
Can't I?
