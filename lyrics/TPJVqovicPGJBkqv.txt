i'm a little dizzy and i can't think straight
took a few too many, i'm on my way

it's too late now looking back
no regret until i crash
on the road to nowhere
i can't breathe, there's no air
i can't find where home is
i don't remember where i live

i can't find where home is
i don't remember where i live
