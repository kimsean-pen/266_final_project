Keeping up appearances, don't break now
Or buckle from the weight
Pretend to laugh but don't laugh too loud
Do you feel the pressure building
The anger spilling out now
Meanwhile the cracks have formed on
The masks we've worn up 'til now

We are far from perfect
But perfect as we are
We are bruised, we are broken
But we are goddamn works of art
Works of art

The pieces of our hearts all gravitated
Together, but before we could be part of this mosaic
We had to break apart like glass, we're
Falling faster than stars
Meanwhile the cracks have formed on
The masks we've worn up 'til now

Take a look, we are far from perfect
But perfect as we are
We are bruised, we are broken
But we are goddamn works of art

In every color we shine
A tapestry of scars
With every thread we're
Growing stronger and moving on, we're
Finding right ways despite the wrong ones
We're clearing paths blocked by storms
We're finding the beauty
In what you've ignored

We are far from perfect
But perfect as we are
We are far from perfect
But perfect as we are
We are bruised, we are broken
But we are goddamn works of art
Yeah we are perfect as we are (perfect as we are)
