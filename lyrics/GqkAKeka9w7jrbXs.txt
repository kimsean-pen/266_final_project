I'd like to get to know ya, so I can show you
Put the pussy on you, like I told you
Gimme all your numbers so I can phone you
Your girl acting stank then call me over
Not on the bed, lay me on your sofa
Call before you come, I need to shave my chocha
You do or you don't or you will or you won't you

Go downtown and eat it like a vulture
See my hips and my tips so cha

See my ass and my lips don't cha
Lost a few pounds in my waist for ya

This the kinda beat that go wa ta ta
Ra ta ta ta, ta ta ta ta ta
Sex me so good I say, "Blah blah blah"
Work it! I need a glass of water

If you're a fly gal, get your nails done

Get a pedicure, get your hair did
Boy lift it up, let's make a toast ah
Let's get drunk, it's gon' bring us closer

Don't I look like a Halle Berry poster?
See the Belvedere playin' tricks on you
Girlfriend wanna be like me never
You won't find a bitch that's even better
I make it hot as Las Vegas weather
Listen up close while I take you backwards
I'm not a prostitute but I can give you what you want
I love your braids and your mouth full of fonts
Love the way my ass go ba bump ba bump bump
Keep your eyes on my ba bump ba bump bump

You think you can handle this go dunk go dunk dunk
Take my thong off and my ass go boom
Cut the lights off so you see what I can do
Is it worth it, let me work it

Wan tan taya taya tang a tang, wan tan taya taya tang a tang
Girls, girls, get the cash
If it's nine to five or shakin' you ass
Ain't no shame ladies, do your thing
Just make sure you ahead of the game
Just 'cause I got a lot of fame super
Prince couldn't get me change my name papa
Kunta Kinte, enslave a game, no sir
Picture Black say'n, "Oh yessa massa"
Picture Lil' Kim dating a pastor
Minute Man, Big Red can outlast ya
Who is the best? I don't have to ask you
When I come out, you won't even mattah
Why you act dumb like ugh, duh
So you act dumb like ugh, duh
And the drummer boy go pa rum pa pum pum
Give you some some some of this Cinnabon
