Everyday is another war
We live and die in a hopeless world
Laying waste to the innocent
With no regret, I'm sick of it

We create, we destroy
The descendants blade
Will pierce the flesh
We attack and deploy
We are slaves to nothing
But the wars that we fight

It's never ending
The carnage that we see on our TV screens
It's never ending
The hate that tears this world apart
It's never ending
This is just the beginning

Wake up

Don't just sit back
And watch this world fall apart

Everyday is another war
We live and die in a hopeless world
Laying waste to the innocent
With no regret, I'm sick of it
Everyday is another war
We live and die in a hopeless world
Laying waste to the innocent
With no regret, I'm sick of it

Guns firing into masses
Buildings burning, society collapses
We can't just sit back and accept this
We must end, end this terror

This must end
This must end
This must end
This must end
This must end
End this terror

Everyday is another war
We live and die in a hopeless world
Laying waste to the innocent
With no regret, I'm sick of it
Everyday is another war
We live and die in a hopeless world
Laying waste to the innocent
With no regret, I'm sick of it

We create, we destroy
We create
We are slaves to nothing
But the blood on our hands
