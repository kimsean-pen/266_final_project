Sleep it off again
Don't remember
When it started

Failing to communicate
Will it seem like
I'm in half-hearted
There's not much to
Explain

When I'm so in my head
The stronger the theme
The less you will need

To hear it from me
To know what I am trying to say
Sorry if I don't see you
Mind me if my eyes

Cross you
Keep in mind I'm not here
I'm in a different zone
Sorry if my words
Hurt You

Wish I knew the time
To lie to you
Keep in mind I'm not here
I'm from a different world
Wait till I'm unique

I'm a light leader in the making
My wisdom will strip you down
Can't believe all the risk
I'm taking
There's still so much

To learn
And things you haven't heard
I want you to see
Beneath everything

You're not different than me
No matter the language we speak
Sorry if I don't see you
Mind me if my eyes

Cross you
Keep in mind I'm not here
I'm in a different zone
Sorry if my words
Hurt You

Wish I knew the time
To lie to you

Keep in mind I'm not here
I'm from a different world
Sorry if I don't see you
Mind me if my eyes

Cross you
Keep in mind I'm not here
I'm in a different zone
Sorry if my words
Hurt You

Wish I knew the time
To lie to you

Keep in mind I'm not here
I'm from a different world
Sorry if my words
Hurt You

Wish I knew the time
To lie to you

Keep in mind I'm not here
I'm from a different world

Keep in mind I'm not here
I'm from a different world
