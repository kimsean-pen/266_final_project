I miss it so much
No button to touch
No dial to turn
No key to hold

Days turn to nights turn to weeks
Turn to paper into rocks into plastic
My material heart
How it keeps us apart
Watching days turn to nights turn to weeks
Turn everything I got into techniques
My mechanical heart
How it tears me apart

I miss it so much
No button to touch
No dial to turn
No key to hold

I miss it so much
No button to touch
No flick of the switch
Hand on my heart

Days turn to nights, turn to weeks, turn to paper
Into rocks, into plastic
My material heart
How it keeps us apart
Watching days turn to nights, turn to weeks,
Turn everything I got into techniques
My mechanical heart, how it tears me apart

I miss it so much.
No button to touch
No dial to turn
No key to hold

I miss it so much.
No button to touch,
No flick of the switch,
Hand on my heart
