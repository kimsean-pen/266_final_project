Into the dark
I found it by the lake
We were so close
I couldn't bear to wait
'Cause you were a shadow
And I left you in the shade
I was still running from all of my mistakes

oh-ooh, oh-ooh
oh-ooh, oh-ooh oh

Cut to the fallout
That silenced all my words
I was still fighting
For all that you deserved
Although it seems likely
That I left before the storm
The truth is I couldn't
Be the one tomorrow

I traced my lies to the coast
All I could find was your ghost
(All I could find was your ghost)
I traced my lies to the coast
All I could find was your ghost
(All I could find was your ghost)

I stay
Homegrown
Homegrown
Homegrown
I stay
Homegrown
Homegrown
I stay
Homegrown
Homegrown
Homegrown
I stay
Homegrown
Homegrown
I stay
Homegrown
Homegrown
Homegrown

I traced my lies to the coast
(All I could find was your ghost)
All I could find was your ghost
(All I could find was your ghost)
I traced my lies to the coast
(All I could find was your ghost)
All I could find was your ghost
(All I could find...)

Was the winter
That shivered up my spine
It was the winter
That left us both behind
Late in the cover
Only came to bare the sand
Bruise left by lovers
Bruise left by lovers

I traced my lies to the coast
All I could find was your ghost
