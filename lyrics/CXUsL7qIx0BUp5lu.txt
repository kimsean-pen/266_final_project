I don't know where we are
But can you bring me to here again?
I don't know why we've come
But something in me will never fear again
Toe to toe
We all stand tall
Row by row
All eyes glow
Like a rabbit in the headlights
Get your head right
Start a new life shiver in the moonlight
You must embrace it cause' if not you waste it
You're looking for love in all the wrong places
All the wrong places

Hold out your hand for more
What do you stand for?
I know, I know, I know the wrong places
Hold out your hand for more
What do you stand for?
I know, I know, I know

Toe to toe
We all stand tall
Row by row
All eyes glow
Like a rabbit in the headlights
Get your head right
Start a new life shiver in the moonlight
You must embrace it cause' if not you waste it
You're looking for love in the wrong places

I don't know why we've come
But something in me will never fear again
Like a rabbit in the headlights
Get your head right
Start a new life shiver in the moonlight
You must embrace it cause' if not you waste it
You're looking for love in the wrong places

All eyes glow
Like a rabbit in the headlights
Get your head right
Start a new life shiver in the moonlight
You must embrace it cause' if not you waste it
You're looking for love in the wrong places
All the wrong places

Hold out your hand for more
What do you stand for?
I know, I know, I know the wrong places
Hold out your hand for more
What do you stand for?
I know, I know, I know
