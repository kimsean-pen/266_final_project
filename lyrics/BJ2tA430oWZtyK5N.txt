Take me where you're going
Hit me when you're on your way home
Feel me when I'm wrong
Don't just be another word in my song (my song)

I know that I need you
You ain't gon' believe it
No hiding my feelings
I'm just tryna see you
Work over the weekend
Learn all of my secrets
Surf over the deep ends, yeah

I'm drowning on your body
I'm drunk on your vibe tonight
I'm drowning on your body
I'm drunk on your vibe tonight

I'm buzzing hard for you
I'm buzzing hard for you
I'm buzzing hard for you
I'm buzzing hard for you
I'm buzzing hard for you
I'm buzzing hard for you
Girl, you playing

There's more than just emotions
I wanna hear you sing, you belong to me
It's darker than the ocean
Your love is sinking deeper underneath

I know that I need you
You ain't gon' believe it
No hiding my feelings
I'm just tryna see you
Work over the weekend
Learn all of my secrets
Surf over the deep ends, yeah

I'm drowning on your
I'm drowning on your
I'm drowning on your body
I'm drunk on your vibe tonight
I'm drowning on your body
I'm drunk on your vibe tonight

I'm buzzing hard for you
I'm buzzing hard for you
I'm buzzing hard for you
I'm buzzing hard for you
I'm buzzing hard for you
I'm buzzing hard for you
Girl, you playing
