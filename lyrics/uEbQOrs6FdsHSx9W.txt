I don't have many friends
Most of them are pretend
Another day to spend
Alone again
Alone again

The world thinks I'm a mess
Mediocre at best
Fell behind all the rest
I'm obsessed
Cause all I wanna do is get

High, high, high
That's where I wanna be
High, high, high
No more anxiety
High, high, high
That's where I wanna be
High, high, high
There's something wrong with me
Cause all I wanna do is get

These voices speak to me
They breed insanity
Drown out reality
Inside of me
Inside of me

Wish my life wasn't real
So I would never feel
Only one way to heal
I can't conceal
That all I wanna do is get

High, high, high
That's where I wanna be
High, high, high
No more anxiety
High, high, high
That's where I wanna be
High, high, high
There's something wrong with me
Cause all I wanna do is get
High

High, high, high
That's where I wanna be
High, high, high
No more anxiety
High, high, high
That's where I wanna be
High, high, high
There's something wrong with me
Cause all I wanna do is get
High, high, high
That's where I wanna be
High, high, high
My only therapy
High, high, high
That's where I wanna be
High, high, high
There's something wrong with me
Cause all I wanna do is get
High
