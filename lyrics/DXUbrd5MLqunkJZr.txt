I just want to be
All up in your clouds
And through the haze, just find a place
That I can figure it out
That I can figure it out
Just find a place
Take me to that place

You take me to the place I love
You take me to the place I love
You take me to the place I love
You take me to the place I love

You're a pool of desire
I just want to drown
Drunk off your infatuation
You spin me round and round
If you tell me stop
I'll dream the night away
I'm just having fun, there's no reason
To be afraid

I just want to be
All up in your clouds
And through the haze, just find a place
That I can figure it out
That I can figure it out
Just find a place
Take me to that place

You take me to the place I love
You take me to the place I love
You take me to the place I love
You take me to the place I love
