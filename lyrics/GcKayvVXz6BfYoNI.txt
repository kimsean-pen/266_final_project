Tokyo, Tokyo

In a strickly guarded industrial facility
In the outskirts of the city
Where future is made of iron and plastic
I experienced something fantastic

Down in Tokyo
I made out with a robot
It felt gentle, but robust
I made out with a robot
Down in Tokyo
I made love to a robot
It felt gentle and robust

It had the strength of a man
But the sensual touch of a woman
With its entire processing power
Harnessed to give pleasure
Beyond human measure
In its capriciousness
It did not appear neutral
This robot had read its
Kama Sutra

Down in Tokyo
I made out with a robot
It felt gentle, but robust
I made out with a robot
Down in Tokyo
I made love to a robot
It felt gentle and robust

Tokyo, Tokyo

Down in Tokyo
I made out with a robot
It felt gentle, but robust
I made out with a robot
Down in Tokyo
I made love to a robot
It felt gentle and robust
