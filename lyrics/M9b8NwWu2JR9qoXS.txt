Hooh-hooh, hooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hooh, hooh, hooh

Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
I worry 'bout you, when you're gone

When you leave my arms (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I feel so bad
And I just think about the good times we had
When we kiss goodnight (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ooh, I wanna cry
I can't wait till you're back, back in my arms again

So baby, baby
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
I worry 'bout you, when you're go-one

I wish there could be-ee (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
A way for us
To be together, both day and night
When I see you leave (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
How my poor heart grieves
Call me as soon as you walk in the door
Then I won't have to worry no more-ore

Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
I worry 'bout you, hooh-ooh-hooh-ooh, when you're go-one

Hooh-hooh, hooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hooh, hooh, hooh
Hooh-hooh, hooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hooh, hooh, hooh

So be back baby
(Take good care of yourself) Take good care of yourself
(Take good care of yourself, take good care of yourself)
I worry 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, baby
(Take good care of yourself, take good care of yourself)
I worry 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, baby
(Take good care of yourself, take good care of yourself)
I worry 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, baby
