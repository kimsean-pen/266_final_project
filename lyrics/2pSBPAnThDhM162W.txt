How old were you when you first let a man make love to you?
Next who was he?
Next, how did you feel at the time?
Next, how did you feel afterwards?
What did you feel, what did you think?
Were you pleased, frightened, ecstatic, disgusted?
What did he say? What words did you speak?
That's what I want to know,
Now, tell me, now, now, all of it, now, tell me, yes!
Get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love
You take my body
I give you heat
You say you hungry
I give you meat
I suck your mind
You blow my head
Make love inside your bed
Everybody
Get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love
Every time i get hot, you wanna cool down
Every time i get high, you wanna go down
You say it's enough, in fact it's too much
Every time i wanna get down, get down, make love
I can squeeze, you can shake me
I can feel, when you break me
Come on so heavy-then you take me
You make love, you make love, you make love, you make love
You can make everybody
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Every time i get high, you wanna go down
Every time i get hot you say you wanna cool down
You say it's enough, in fact it's too much
Every time i wanna get down, get down, get down make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Every time i get high, you wanna go down
Every time i get hot you say you wanna cool down
You say it's enough, in fact it's too much
Every time i wanna get down, get down, get down make love
