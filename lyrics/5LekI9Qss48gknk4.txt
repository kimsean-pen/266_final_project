He got a feeling in his head
He's gonna take it to the bed
When everything is going wrong
He feel that feeling, feeling strong
There's only one thing you have left

Come on, give it all you got
Make it hot

Push it to the limit
Push it to the limit
Push it to the limit
Push it to the

Pu-pu-pu-pu-push it to the limit
Push it to the limit
Push it to the limit
Push it to the limit
Push it to the
(Push!)

He got a feeling in his head
He's gonna take it to the bed
When everything is going wrong
He feel that feeling, feeling strong
There's only one thing you have left

Come on, give it all you got
Make it hot

Push it to the limit
Push it to the limit
Push it to the limit
Push it to the
Push it to the limit
Push it to the limit
