Trees and houses stray
Losing voices for the day
For the better and the bright
For the way out... of the night
I just want to slide across
I am trying to get lost
I just want to hear you talk
one more time before we stop

Losing our voices
Losing our voices
For loving

Losing our voices
Losing our voices
For loving

Trees and houses stray
Dead legs turning silver Gray
Oh It happened yesterday
Sunlight washes it away
Where I go, I go alone
I'll be safe cuz this is home
Took the fast lane out of here
To escape the truth, disappear

Losing our voices
Losing our voices
For loving

Losing our voices
Losing our voices
For loving

Losing our voices
Losing our voices
For loving
