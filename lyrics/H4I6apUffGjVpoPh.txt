I like my loneliness and the thoughts it brings
The darkness can sometimes be a pleasure to me
I stand around on the outside, I've been peering from the edge
Looking for the answers to the questions I'll never ask

It's from this place we'll find our peace
And reconcile our bitterness
We have to, we have to, brake break break break

Wash away
Wash away

It's from this loneliness and the fear it brings
That new doors can open up and be a savior to me
So I'll open my mind, open my heart, it's the only way to breathe
It's just a trick of the light she said

So don't panic, no, don't panic
It's from this place we'll find our peace
And reconcile our emptiness
We have to, we have to, break break break break

Wash away
Wash away

It's just a trick of the light she says
Wash away
It's just a trick of the light she says
Wash away

Don't panic
Don't panic
Don't panic

It's just a trick of the light
Don't panic
Don't panic

Wash away
Wash away

It's just a trick of the light she says
Don't panic
Don't panic
Wash away

It's just a trick of the light she says
Don't panic
Don't panic
Wash away

It's just a trick of the light she says
Well don't panic
Wash away

It's just a trick of the light she says
Now don't panic
Don't panic
