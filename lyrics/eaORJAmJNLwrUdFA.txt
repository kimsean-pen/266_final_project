I, I can't lie
I'm scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothing at all?
Nothing at all
What is the point
Of my lips if they don't make noise? Uh
What is the point of doing nothing at all?
Watching it fall
The flicker burning
You know the time is runnin', runnin' out
Only I see
All the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning low
This is not a, this is not a
Swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a
Swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song
Swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life
Real fantasy
Wishing it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doing nothing at all?
Watching it fall
The flicker burning
You know the time is runnin', runnin' out
Only I see
All the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning low
This is not a, this is not a
Swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a
Swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song
Swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life
Tread heavily around you
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily
Tread
This is not a, this is not a
Swan (tread heavily)
Swan song (tread)
This is not a, this is not a
Swan (tread heavily)
Swan song (tread)
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song
Swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life
It's a new life
