I have never loved me like I love you
I've never seen me like I see you
I'm never needing myself like I need you
I never believed like I believe in you

And even if you refuse to be mine
I am yours, yours, yours
And even if the world makes you blind
I am yours, yours, yours

'Cause if you love somebody, set them free
So here are your wings, my baby
I just want you to know if you leave
That I'm yours, yours, yours
'Cause if you love somebody, set them free
So here are your wings, my baby
I just want you to know if you leave
That I'm yours, yours, yours

I have never heard me like I hear you
I have never known me like I know you
I have never felt myself like I feel you
I have never believed like I believe in you

And even if you refuse to be mine,
I am yours, yours, yours
And even if the world makes you blind
I am yours, yours, yours

'Cause if you love somebody, set them free
So here are your wings, my baby
I just want you to know if you leave
That I'm yours, yours, yours
'Cause if you love somebody, set them free
So here are your wings, my baby
I just want you to know if you leave
That I'm yours, yours, yours

So from the bottom of my heart, I trust
This summer was made for us
So from the bottom of my heart, I trust
This summer was made for us
This summer was made for us

'Cause if you love somebody, set them free
So here are your wings, my baby
I just want you to know if you leave
That I'm yours, yours, yours
'Cause if you love somebody, set them free
So here are your wings, my baby
I just want you to know if you leave
That I'm yours, yours, yours
That I'm yours, yours, yours
