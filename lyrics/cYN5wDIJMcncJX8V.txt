I was walkin'
Down a one way street
Just a-lookin'
For someone to meet
One woman
Who was looking for a man
Now I'm hopin' (hopin')
That the feeling is right
And I'm wonderin' (wonderin')
If you'll stay for the night
So I'm comin' (I don't wanna be lonely)
Oh (baby, please tell me)
I wanna love you all over
(Do you believe in love)
(Do you believe it's true)
(Do you believe in love)
Oh, you're makin' me believe it too
Now the feelin'
Is beginning to grow
And though the meaning
Is somethin' you only know
If you believe it
Take my hand, and I'll take your heart
Come on
Now I wonder (wonder)
Where does true love begin
I'm going under (under)
So I'm lettin' you in
My woman (I don't wanna be lonely)
Oh (baby, please tell me)
I wanna love you all over
(Do you believe in love)
Do you believe in love (do you believe it's true)
Do you believe it's kinda true (do you believe in love)
Oh, you're making me believe it too

I used to have you in a photograph
I'm so glad it's changed
But now I've got you and it's gonna last
Do you believe in love (do you believe in love)
(Do you believe it's true)
I'm so glad, I'm so glad (do you believe in love)
Oh, you're makin' me believe it too, girl
Do you believe in love
Do you believe it's true
Do you believe in love
I believe in love too
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh
