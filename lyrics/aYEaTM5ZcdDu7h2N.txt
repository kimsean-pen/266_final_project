Got bitten fingernails and a head full of the past
And everybody's gone at last
A sweet sweet smile that's fading fast
'Cause everybody's gone at last

Don't get upset about it
No not anymore
There's nothing wrong
That wasn't wrong before

Had a second alone with a chance let pass
And everybody's gone at last

Well I hope you're not waiting
Waiting around for me
Because I'm not going anywhere, obviously

Got a broken heart and your name on my cast
And everybody's gone at last
Everybody's gone at last
