Trapped indoors with a midget and dwarf and you love it.
Like a beast on a hunt, on a prowl in deep water.
The police says there's nothing going on.
In the basement no-one will hear this song.

There's no handle on this door, you can't open it.
There's no chance that you'll survive, daddy's coming

Like a broken bridge beneath troubled water.
Like a clown without a decent disorder.
