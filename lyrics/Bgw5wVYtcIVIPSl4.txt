So hey, hey
How does it feel
When they take
From us
When they steal
So pray, pray
To a God on a Dollar bill
Have faith in all that is not real (that isn't real)

I can't take
Can't take
Any longer this
I can't take
Can't take
Any longer this
I can't take
Can't take
Any longer this
We've got to slow your move

Til you walk
Til you walking in my shoes?
Til you walk
Til you walking in my shoes?
Til you walk
Til you walking in my shoes?
Til you walk
Til you walking in my shoes?

So when you make, make
Your noise
Make sure you turn it up
Break, break
The walls they've build - We've stuck
Fake dream
We coming we coming
You better run to a safe place
I'm sure we'll keep all your fun

I can't take
Can't take
Any longer this
I can't take
Can't take
Any longer this
I can't take
Can't take
Any longer this
We've got to slow your move

So impulsive
I'm destructive

This is getting out of hand
This is getting out of hand
This is getting out of hand
It's getting out of hand
This is getting out of hand
This is getting out of hand
This is getting out of hand
It's getting out of hand
Getting out of hand
This is getting out of hand
This is getting out of hand

I can't take
Can't take
Any longer this
I can't take
Can't take
Any longer this
I can't take
Can't take
Any longer this
We've got to slow your move

I can't take
Can't take
Any longer this
I can't take
Can't take
Any longer this
I can't take
Can't take
Any longer this
We've got to slow your move

Til you walk
Til you walking in my shoes?
Til you walk
Til you walking in my shoes?
Til you walk
Til you walking in my shoes?
Til you walk
Til you walking in my shoes?
