I love you, yes i do
'cos i know that you love me too
I love you, yes i do
gona spend all my money on you

Everyday when i say, that i'm not gona take anymore
its ok, don't go away, i feel bad when you're closing the door

I love you

Need some more, to restore all the feeling that i get from you
i want more, give me more, all i want is a barrell of you

I love you, yes i do
'cos i know that you love me too
i love you, yes i do
gona spend all my money on you
woh woh woh woh

I don't care, when they stare, at the way that i'm always with you
we're a pair, it's not fair when they say we're a special brew!
woh woh woh woh

I love you

hey... hey... hey... hey
hey... hey... hey... hey
hey... hey... hey... hey
hey... hey... hey... hey

Everyday, when i say, that i'm not gona take anymore
it's ok, dont go away, i feel bad when you're closing the door

Need some more, to restore all the feeling that i get from you
i want more, give me more, all i want is a barrell of you
woh woh woh woh woh woh woh

I love you, yes i do
cos i know that you love me too!
