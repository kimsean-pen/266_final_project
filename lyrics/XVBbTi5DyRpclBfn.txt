Lines all around me
Truth can be lies and the devil dont want you free
Can anybody be, on my one thats around
No one cage no, let me out

On mark our tombstones but the family still cares
There were so many words i should've never care

And oh, you got stuck inside the __
But i cut you free, but i cut you free
And oh, i stare at your wounds for how long
For how long, for how long, for you
For how long, for you

Solitudes of never ____
And now your loves bound your feet
And you cast in shadows to this evening
I never knew how it could be
I took a lot, i took once more
I want to do something to show you to me
Cause you know that no one really knows me

And oh, you got stuck inside
But i caught you free, i caught you free
And oh, i stare at your wounds for how long
For how long, for how long, for you
For how long, for you

On mark our tombstones but the family still cares
There were so many words i should've never care

Oooh oooh
I caught you free, i caught you free
Oooh oooh
I caught you free, i caught you free

And oh, you got stuck inside
But i caught you free, i caught you free
And oh, i stare at your wounds for how long
For how long, for how long, for you
For how long, for you

On mark our tombstones but the family still cares
There were so many words i should've never care
