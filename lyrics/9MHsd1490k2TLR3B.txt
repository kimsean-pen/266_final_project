Don't you wanna be automatic
Don't you wanna live automatically
Say you wanna
Say the word

Miracle cures
You don't think twice
You don't think about it
Something I heard
You don't take a bite you won't know

Don't you wanna be automatic
Don't you wanna live

Don't you wanna be automatic
Don't you wanna live automatically
Say you wanna
Say the word
And you're cured

Liberal words
I won't tell your friends
I won't tell your mother
Out of this world
You don't make this right you won't know

Don't you wanna be automatic
Don't you wanna live

Don't think twice don't think
Take that bite, take it

Won't you say the word
And you're cured

Don't you wanna be automatic
Don't you wanna live automatically
Say you wanna
Say the word
Something that I gotta believe

Don't you wanna be automatic
Don't you wanna live automatically
Say you wanna
Say the word
And you're cured
Say you wanna
Say you're cured
