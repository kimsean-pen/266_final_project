She's a ringer,
Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring around her finger
Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring

It's a lady, got a lot of ambition
Shady's my intiuition
Says she's a doctor cause she's got the bills
She's just a ringer who lives in the hills
So crazy, don't know if I can trust her
Lately, she talking like a hustler
She could be the American dream, I'd do anything for her to marry me
She's worth the weight in gold
But one thing I know

She's a ringer
Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring around her finger
Gotta know, gotta know, gotta know
She's a ringer
Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring around her finger
Gotta know, gotta know, gotta know

She's a lady, gonna be richer than her daddy
This year she's sipping on a forty
Love is free, but it won't cone cheap, she'll rub all the boys if they get too weak
She told me her love is like the dollar
Greedy cause I never really had her
She won't be my American dream
Wear my ring, she said it won't be me
She's worth the weight in gold
But on thing I know

She's a ringer
Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring around her finger
Gotta know, gotta know, gotta know
She's a ringer
Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring around her finger
Gotta know, gotta know, gotta know

She looks so hungry to me with her golden teeth
Will I ever be enough, move or she might knock you out
Only fight for three, the world won't be enough

She's a ringer
Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring around her finger
Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring
She's a ringer
Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring around her finger
Gotta know, gotta know, gotta know
She's a ringer
Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring around her finger
Gotta know, gotta know, gotta know
Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring around her finger
Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring around her finger
