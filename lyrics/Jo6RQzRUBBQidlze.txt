If you didn't know
All the moments
When I lose myself
I would tell the world
I'm catching flies by now
Speaking to someone
Breaking the windows
This house is dead

The sound of falling
When the pictures are moving
Between the memories
The sound of falling
When the pictures are moving
Dead in time

Brave try
The meaning of loss
I know your smile
Is deadly at this point
Wherever you are
I am not

If you didn't know
All the moments
When I lose myself
I would tell the world
I guess i should
Know the limits of the world
There are moments I find myself
Not breathing at all
