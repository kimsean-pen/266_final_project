To simplify a change of season

We can go so much farther than we've come today
Holdin' on girl and come what may
Come what may

Catchin' a wave to ride on
Steady now (oo-oo-oo-oo)
Headin' where we decide on

And I know that there's something that's just out of sight
And I feel like we're trying to do something right
Come on make it if we hold on tight

Hold on tight
