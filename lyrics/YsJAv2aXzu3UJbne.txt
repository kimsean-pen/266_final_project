I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul
Give me things that I've wanted to know
Tell me things that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold

You're the heat that I know
Listen, you are my sun
Oh oh oh oh oh
Hush, I said there's more to life than rush

Not gonna leave this place with us
Drop the game, it's not enough
Hush, I said there's more to life than rush

Not gonna leave this place with us
Drop the game, it's not enough
I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul

Give me things that I've wanted to know
Tell me things that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold
You're the heat that I know

Listen, you are my sun
Oh oh oh oh oh
I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul
Give me things that I've wanted to know

Tell me things that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold
You're the heat that I know
Listen, you are my sun

Oh oh oh oh oh
I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul
Give me things that I've wanted to know
Tell me things that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold
You're the heat that I know
Listen, you are my sun
Oh oh oh oh oh
