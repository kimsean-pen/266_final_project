When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
Well, I won't be afraid
No, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

So darling, darling,
Stand by me,
Won't you stand by me
Just as long as you stand,
Stand by me

When the sky that we look upon
tumbles and fall
And the mountains crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry,
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

So darling, darling,
Stand by me,
Oh won't you stand by me
Oh won't you stand, oh won't you stand
Stand by me
Darling, darling,
Stand by me,
Oh won't you, stand by me
Oh won't you stand, oh won't you stand
Stand by me

When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
I won't cry, No I won't cry,
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand by me

So darling, darling,
Stand by me,
Oh won't you stand by me
Oh won't you stand, oh won't you stand
Stand by me
Darling, darling,
Stand by me,
Oh won't you stand by me
Oh won't you stand, oh won't you stand
Stand by me

When the sky that we look upon
Crumbles and fall
And the mountains tumble to the sea
I won't cry, No I won't cry,
No, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand by me

Darling, darling,
Stand by me,
Oh won't you stand by me
Oh won't you stand, oh won't you stand
Stand by me
Darling, darling,
Stand by me,
Oh won't you stand by me
Oh won't you stand, oh won't you stand
Stand by me

Darling, darling,
Stand by me,
Oh won't you stand by me
Oh won't you stand, oh won't you stand
Stand by me
Darling, darling,
Stand by me,
Oh won't you stand by me
Oh won't you stand, oh won't you stand
Stand by me
