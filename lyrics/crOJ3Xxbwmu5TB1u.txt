Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to goooo
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do Nowhere to go oh
I wanna be sedated

Just get me to the airport
And put me in a plane
Hurry hurry hurry
Before I go insane
I can't control my fingers

I can't control my brain
Oh No oh oh oh ohhhh!
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to goooo
I wanna be sedated

Nothing to do Nowhere to go oh
I wanna be sedated

Just put me in a wheelchair
And get me on a plane

Hurry hurry hurry
Before I go insane
I can't control my fingers
I can't control my brain

Oh No oh oh oh ohhhh!
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to goooo

I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do Nowhere to go oh

I wanna be sedated
Just put me in a wheelchair
And get me to the show
Hurry hurry hurry

Before I go loco
I can't control my fingers
I can't control my toes
Oh No oh oh oh ohhhh!
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go

I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do Nowhere to go oh
I wanna be sedated
Just put me in a wheelchair

And get me to the show

Hurry hurry hurry
Before I go loco
I can't control my fingers
I can't control my toes
Oh No oh oh oh ohhhh!
