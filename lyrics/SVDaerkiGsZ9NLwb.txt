A child will look up in the sky
Ask guidance from the sun
And directions from the moon
Counsel from the mighty ones
Hiding beyond the stars
Far above this earth

No redemption from the skies
No response up from heavens
No relief will ever come
From beyond this realm

For the spirits in their halls
Will turn away their glance
Hearken to the songs of the stars

Consider the weight of time
Ponder over the spheres
Watch how the firmament turns
To place your trust in them
Is like leaving in the dark
Like letting the gale take you where it may

Ward off your fears
Break your harness
Forge your own fate
Rebuild yourself
