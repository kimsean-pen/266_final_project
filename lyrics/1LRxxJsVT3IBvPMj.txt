If you let me show you
We could visit planets in the middle of the night
Do you mind, love?
You could be my man on the Moon singing out of tune
You still sound alright, love
If I get to know you
I could leave a copy of the key under the mat, love
Let you unlock the door to all of me
Can you image that, love?

My love
Gravity won't stop us from taking off
And if we get lost
Galaxies apart
Gravity won't stop us from taking off
And if we get caught
Trapped inside the dark

If you can't imagine
I can be the escort that brings you to the light, love
Let's be old fashioned, were all using telephones
Will you call me tonight, boy?
If you wanna find me
Find me on a walk this evening in the park, boy?
Come and unlock the door to all of me
Set fire to the spark, boy

Don't be an alien to my love
Gravity won't stop us from taking off
And if we get lost
Galaxies apart
Gravity won't stop us from taking off
And if we get caught
Trapped inside the dark
Gravity won't stop us from taking off
And if we get lost
Trapped inside the dark
Gravity won't stop us from taking off
And if we get caught
Galaxies apart
Galaxies apart
Gala, galaxies apart
Gala, galaxies apart
Galaxies apart
