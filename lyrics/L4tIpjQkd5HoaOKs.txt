Our light is shining
So bright that even the sun is
Desperately making time for you
Making time for me
Making time for us
To be even more in love than we are
Than we are
Than we are
Than we are

We got time to grow (Grow)
To think (Think)
To breathe
The air we need
Let the daylight sink (Sink)
So you and me
Can fall asleep

Let's put our trust in
Something that's bigger than us
And will inevitably
Make sometime for you
Make sometime for me
Make sometime for us
To fall even deeper than we are
Than we are
Than we are
Than we are

We got time to grow (Grow)
To think (Think)
To breathe
The air we need
Let the daylight sink (Sink)
So you and me
Can fall asleep
