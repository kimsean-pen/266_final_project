I got to get a message through
I don't know where we're going
I wrap my arms around your naked shoulders
Take cover for the night
I see you in the morning rain
Oh step inside and lay beside me
Tender can you close my eyes and blind me
Oh give me just a smile...
Before I fade to silver, silver blue for you
Before I fade to silver, silver blue for you.

I've turned into the broken one
who lost the inspiration
I want to give you all my love like water
To a blood red rose
The passion - I can't deal with her
The pain - well, I can do without him
And this is like the milky way and ocean
That only grows and grows.
And babe I fade to silver, silver blue for you
I turn and fade to silver, silver blue for you.
And babe I fade to silver, silver blue for you
I turn and fade to silver, silver blue

I wrap my arms around your naked shoulders
Take cover for the night

And babe I fade to silver, silver blue for you
I turn and fade to silver, silver blue for you
And babe I fade to silver, silver blue for you, for you
I turn and fade to silver, silver blue ...
