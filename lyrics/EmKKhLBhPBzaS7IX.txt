The lack of light, hollow sea,
Poison beaches, limousines
Toothless dentists, cops that kill

My baby's got the lonesome lows
Don't just go away overnight
Dr. Blind just prescribe the blue ones
If the dizzying highs don't subside overnight
Dr. Blind just prescribe the red one

Da, da, da, da, da...

Hard to hold, cold to touch
Fall to pieces, treat the rush in hindsight
Prime-time's gone
All your pain will end here
Let the doctor soothe your brain, dear

My baby's got the lonesome lows
Don't quite go away overnight
Dr. Blind just prescribe the blue ones
If the dizzying highs don't subside overnight
Dr. Blind just prescribe the red one

Da, da, da, da, da...
