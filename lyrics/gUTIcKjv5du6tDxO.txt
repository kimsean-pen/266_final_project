Ooo i'm lost in you
Ooo i'm lost in you
Ooo i'm lost in you
When the fuck we finish these bottles baby
I'm in the deepest vibe
You don't know what you started baby
Another sleepless night

Ride me like a Tidal Wave
Take control I'll give you mine
Ride me like Tidal wave
Ooooo... singin

All you got to do is make me answer to your call
Singin, all you got to do is throw your body gainst the wall
Singin, all you got to do is make me answer to your call
Keep me wonderin' why

Cuz I'm Faded
Ooo I'm lost in you
Keep me wonderin' why

Cuz I'm Faded
Ooo I'm lost in you
Ooo I'm lost in you

Let me light your fire baby
I got you screaming while I'm lovin you in style baby
You give me butterflies
Love me like you want me to
You give me butterflies
Love me like you want me to, ohhhhh sick yeah

As long as you're around I never want to be lonely
Fuck the other women I just want you to hold me
Imma let you in baby until you know me, until you know me
Oh can you show me
Long as you around I never want to be lonely
Fuck the next woman I just want you to hold me
I may Just lose my mind

Cuz I'm Faded
Ooo I'm lost in you
Keep me wonderin' why

Cuz I'm Faded
Ooo I'm lost in you
Ooo I'm lost in you

No nobody needs you like I do
I wish that I could be here through the night right next to you
My lusting for your sensual disguise got me confused
And all I can do is sigh, oh why oh why oh why oh why oh why

Ooo I'm lost in you
Keep me wonderin' why

Cuz I'm Faded
Ooo I'm lost in you
Ooo I'm lost in you
