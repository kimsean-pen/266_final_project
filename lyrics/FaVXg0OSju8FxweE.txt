Hello Heartbreak

Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak
Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak

I got a strange connection to pain
I can't seem to walk away from hurt
I'm always running into danger zone
I need protection, a change
What is affection? It's I'm longing for
It cuts me deep, but I'm still wanting more

Hello, heartbreak
It's good to see you
Happiness came
But it just lets me down
Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak
Lets me down
Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak
Hey there, sadness
I knew I'd meet you
'Cause when all else fails
You'll always be around
Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak
Be around
Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak

Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak
Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak

I've got this huge attraction to you
I must be going out my mind, oh
(Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak)
Wasting time
I'm aching deep inside

Hello, heartbreak
It's good to see you
Happiness came
But it just lets me down
Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak
Lets me down
Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak
Hey there, sadness
I knew I'd meet you
'Cause when all else fails
You'll always be around
Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak
Be around
Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak

Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak
Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak

Hello, heartbreak
It's good to see you
Happiness came
But it just lets me down
Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak
Lets me down
Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak
Hey there, sadness
I knew I'd meet you
'Cause when all else fails
You'll always be around
Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak
Be around
Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak

Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak
Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak
