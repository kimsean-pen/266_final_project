I love the aspects of another city
The representatives are alright
It's such an amazing mistake at a time
Got waking up and seeing the industrialize light

I broadcast
Goes on another day now
All for a cold sore,
Something I know nothing

I love the aspects of another city
It's got your number and your blood type
They've been in danger, I need some focus
The apparitions of another prodigal night, right?

I broadcast,
Goes on another day now
All for a high score,
Something I know nothing
I broadcast!

I got it, I got it, I got it I broadcast,
Goes on for another day now
All for an cold sore,
Something I know nothing.
