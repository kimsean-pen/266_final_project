Your eyes followed me here
Your eyes, seamless and sure
They leave me broken and
In need of a cure

Your eyes followed me here
Your eyes, sifting my soul
They leave me broken hands
Forge diamonds from the coal

They lace me along
Infinite synapse of white lines
Then chasing the dawn
Story book syntax
Your eyes

Slit the throat
Of all I know
About myself and this life
Silhouette lies

And your eyes, speaking in tongues
Vigilant still filling my lungs
Testing my will

They leave me broken and
Bruised and bleeding
Your eyes resting in flame
Leave me breathless again

Like hydrogen
Spread on fault lines
Or dead, kissing them with
Exposure to radon
Your eyes

Slit the throat
Of all I know
About myself and this life
Silhouette lies

Your eyes
Your eyes
Speaking in tongues
Vigilant still lead our way

Your eyes (They leave me broken and)
Your eyes (Bruised and bleeding)
Filling my lungs
Testing my will

You slit the throat
Of all I know
About myself and this life
Silhouette lies

You slit my throat
'Cause I know
That this life
Is a lie
So slit my throat.
