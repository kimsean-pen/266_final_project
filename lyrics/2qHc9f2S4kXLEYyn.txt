These niggas they wan' see me dead, but not before I kill you, before
I'm walkin' around wit' one in the hand, stayin' alert is important

He told me that he was not using a
scale when he was serving that dirty
Now my lil' partner is runnin' from 12, 'cause he hit him wit' the .40
My other lil' partner just ended up

Lay my Draco behind my bed when I wake up in the mornin'
Then go make a nigga eat the only word he said 'bout my dead homie
They gon' ask what you doin' wit' all
them birds, told them that I gotta make money
Free my dog, let 'em know you comin'
Livin' through me, 'cause I'm that one
