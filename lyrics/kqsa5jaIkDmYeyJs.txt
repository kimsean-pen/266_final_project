They're holding on, and it's getting old
Waiting for the day, tangled up in space
I found it once, you'll do it twice
You want to be the one, and not just for fun

This is all we've got, you know it's not a lot
You have to level up, or else it's gonna stop

And I can see it when you lie, why do you even try
You try to see it but it doesn't show
Was it all in your mind?
You try to see it but it doesn't show
Was it all in your mind?
