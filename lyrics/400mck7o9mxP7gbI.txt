New. Found. Land.

Beyond the boundaries of the known world
Where are the mountains and where are the fjords?
Hundreds of miles off the course we are lost
Clear skies return as we witness the shore

We sail the sea (Yeah!)
We fight the storm (Yeah!)
One hundred men caught by endless passion
Adventure Norse Men (New!)
A hunting eye (Found!)
One hundred men (Land!) on a holy mission

My arms are tired and my feet are cold
Hoping for shelter and hungry for food
My eyes see fire, a gift from the gods
What will we find at the end of the world?

We sail the sea (Yeah!)
We fight the storm (Yeah!)
One hundred men caught by endless passion
Adventure Norse Men (New!)

A hunting eye (Found!)
One hundred men (Land!) on a holy mission

We have found new land

We set sail for Greenland
As we crossed the oceans
Awaiting the Midgard serpent
We finally found a new world

We sail the sea (Yeah!)
We fight the storm (Yeah!)
One hundred men caught by endless passion
Adventure Norse Men (New!)
A hunting eye (Found!)
One hundred men (Land!) on a holy mission

We have found new land (New found land)
We see (New!)
New found (Found!)
Land (New found land)
