I watched the water rise
But turned my head and closed my eyes
Hoped the threat would go away
So it all would stay the same
Wished the tidal waves would die
So that I could defend whys
That rescued me from drowning in our lies

Come
Come save me from these waters
These waves too tall for me
They'll bury me in silence
The currents forcing me to sea
I did not leave you behind

The unconcern was just too much for me
I tried to swim these waters blind
And then there was only me and the sea
Me and the sea

Come
Come save me from these waters
These waves too tall for me
They'll bury me in silence
The currents forcing me to sea

Come
Come save me from these waters
I'll soon be out of reach

Come
Come save me from these waters
These waves too tall for me
They'll bury me in silence
The currents forcing me to sea

Come
Come save me from these waters
I'll soon be out of reach
I'll soon be out of reach
I'll soon be out of reach
I'll soon be out of reach
