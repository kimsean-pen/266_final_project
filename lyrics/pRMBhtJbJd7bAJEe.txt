I gotta learn, learn, oh, how to be where I don't want to
And how to drown out all the other ideas around you
I gotta sit down, get the story right
No, I'm not going out tonight
I've got a clear mind and I'm ready to be without you

No, I don't think you know my name
Or what you're trying to do to me
I don't think you want me here
But I'm staying around so

I'm open, I'm opening another way of
I'm open, I'm opening another way of
I'm open, I'm opening another way of
I'm open, I'm opening another way of
Life

I gotta learn, learn that the weight of the world surrounds you
I gotta let go of the pressure I feel to outdo
The thing I just did and what I'll do today
And work to live in my own way
So then I won't let another disappointment haunt you

Because I don't think you know my name
Or what you're trying to do to me
I don't think you want me here
But I'm staying around so

I'm open, I'm opening another way of
I'm open, I'm opening another way of
I'm open, I'm opening another way of
I'm open, I'm opening another way of
Life

Oh, life
Oh, it takes time
Takes time to heal
Oh, life
Oh, life
Oh, it takes time
Takes time to heal
Hey!

I'm open, I'm opening another way of
I'm open, I'm opening another way of
I'm open, I'm opening another way of
I'm open, I'm opening another way of
Life
