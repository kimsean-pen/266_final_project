(Daniel Lanois)

The streets are cracked
And there's glass everywhere
And a baby stares out
With motherless eyes
Under long gone beauty
On fields of war
Trapped in lament
To the poet's core.

Oh where, oh where will I be
Oh where, oh when that trumpets sounds.

Met an Indian boy in Ottawa
He laid me down on a bed of straw
Said don't waste your breath
Don't waste your heart
Don't blister your heels
Running in the dark.

Oh where, oh where will I be
Oh where, oh when that trumpets sounds.

Yeah I like the heat
Of your body laying under me
May your wild lip get you where your going
With your inventions your intentions, your laughter
Your forever yearning.

Oh where, oh where will I be
Oh where, oh when that trumpets sounds.

I walked to the river
And I walked to the rim
I walked through the teeth of the reaper's grin
I walked to you rolled up in wire
To the other side of desire.

Oh where, oh where will I be
Oh where, oh when that trumpets sounds.

Oh where, oh where oh where when that trumpet sounds
Oh where, oh where oh when that trumpet sounds.

Well the heart opens wide like it's never seen love
And addiction stays on tight like a glove
Oh where, oh where will I be.
