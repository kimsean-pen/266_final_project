We could never have won this;
We were fighting lions

Now we've all but conquered fate,
So hate us, and see if we mind

Washing off the dust
Like the first rains of the raining season
And encircling rage and reason, we postponed our grieving
But the rains, they never seem to come

To have you here
To make you see
The wild hoax we pulled; it's all over

What care for glory?
What care for thee?
By now, you know it's all over.
All over.
All over.

To this house of stone we flock
Hiding like the snails between the reeds and rocks
And they'll be searching the valleys in vain
As we'll be waiting for the rain

A nation reborn;
A lame shepherd

One must wait and go for the throat when hunting leopard
Now, we're blinking back each tear
There's no changing the balance of fear

To have you here
To make you see
The wild hoax we pulled; it's all over

What care for glory?
What care for thee?
By now, you know it's all over.
All over.
All over.

To have you here
To make you see
The wild hoax we pulled; it's all over

What care for glory?
What care for thee?
By now, you know it's all over.

To have you here
To make you see
The wild hoax we pulled; it's all over

What care for glory?
What care for thee?
By now, you know
It's all over
All over.
All over.
All over.
