Am I the son in or out of law?
How many chances do I get before my head explodes?
What's going on?

What's going on?
When I look into the mirror there's another gun
What's going on?
What's going on?

When I look into the mirror there's another gun
When I tell you I'll be fine
I still want you by my side
Please just try to read between the lines
Where's my comfort in the undefined?

Please just try to read between the lines

Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I'm your son, do you hear my call?

Even if everything I touch will slowly turn to stone?
What's going on?
What's going on?
When I look into the mirror there's another gun

What's going on?
What's going on?
When I look into the mirror there's another gun
When I tell you I'll be fine
I still want you by my side

Please just try to read between the lines
Where's my comfort in the undefined?
Please just to try to read between the lines
What is the poison inside of me?

The sickness in my head?
Put me to sleep while I find a cure
For the sickness in my head

We are the sons
We are the daughters
The generation of disorder
We are the sons
We are the daughters
The generation of disorder
Go!
(What is the poison inside of me?
The sickness in my head?)
When I tell you I'll be fine
I still want you by my side
