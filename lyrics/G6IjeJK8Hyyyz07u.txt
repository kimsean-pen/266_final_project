Like a storm, lightning striking black and white
You were born out of this darkness and light
To this world with a thorn stuck in your side
I'm a girl, you're a boy, we're left outside
And will, will you meet me by the river's edge
as i lay low down my head?
until ... hold to thy breast
Just to be there in my dreams.
On that day I was searching for the one
And I found honey dripping from the sun
Will you be my one and only star tonight?
In the sea, you're the one that shone so bright
I'm ... will you meet me by the river's edge?
as i lay low down my head
Until they hold to thy breast
will you drown me in shallow tears?
No, don't go away, a way!
No, don't go away, away!
No, don't go away, away!
No, don't go away, away!
