Burn the witches, burn the witches
Don't take time to sew your stitches
Burn the witches, burn the witches

Good is the thing that you favor, evil is your sour flavor
You cannot sedate all the things you hate
(Burn!)
(Burn fucker)

Burn your bridges, burn your bridges
Don't take time to sew your stitches
Burn your bridges, burn your bridges

Good is the thing that you favor, evil is your sour flavor
I don't need your hate, I decide my fate (burn)
You cannot sedate all the things you hate (burn)
(burn burn burn burn fucker)

Good is the thing that you favor, evil is your sour flavor
