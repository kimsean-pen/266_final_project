I'd sell my soul just to see your face
And I'd break my bones just to heal your pain
And in these times I need a saving grace
Cause time is running out
And I'm starting to lose my faith

But if I told you I loved you would it make you wanna stay
I'm sorry for the way I make you feel day after day
And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home to stay
Would it make you, make you wanna stay

My hearts on my sleeve but its turning black
And without your touch I'm not gonna last
It feels like my walls are cavin' in
And I'll do anything
To have you here again

But if I told you I loved you would it make you wanna stay
I'm sorry for the way I make you feel day after day
And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home to stay

The days are cold the nights are long
And I can't stand to be alone
Please know this is not your fault
And all I want
Is to tell you I love you and make you wanna stay
I'm sorry for the way I make you feel day after day
And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home to stay

Would it make you, make you wanna stay
I'm sorry for my ways
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
Will it ever be enough
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
