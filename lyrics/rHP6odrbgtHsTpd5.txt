She's as old as she wants to be
And is cold as ice
And she can walk like a
Millipede right out of your life

It'll be thanks for the memories
A ghost in her machine
If you've tested her twice
Then you'll know what I mean
Cause she's so cool

She's moving into your mind
Alright and out of your life
Leave you love sick and lonely
She's probably wearing
Your shirt tonight waving bye bye
Isn't she lovely

She ain't taking no shit
She never did
Nobody's ever beat her,
Since she left the house for dead
And she's better than you,
Even better than me
And I guess I'll never have her
But as long as I can breathe
She's so cool

She's moving into your mind
Alright and out of your life
Leave you love sick and lonely
She's probably wearing your
Shirt and not waving bye bye
Isn't she lovely

I cannot go there I know it
I'd just be wasting her time
I cannot go there I know that
I'd just be wasting her time
She used to be a friend of mine

She's moving into your mind
Alright and out of your life
Leave you love sick and lonely
She's probably wearing
Your shirt tonight waving bye bye
Isn't she lovely

She's moving into your mind
Alright and out of your life
Leave you love sick and lonely
She's probably wearing
Your shirt tonight waving bye bye
Isn't she lovely

She's moving into your mind
Alright and out of your life
Leave you love sick and lonely
She's probably wearing
Your shirt tonight waving bye bye
Isn't she lovely

And it feels just like the eighties
Don't it feel like the eighties to you
Feels just the eighties
Seems just like the latest move
Don't it feel like the eighties
She's just like the eighties to me.
