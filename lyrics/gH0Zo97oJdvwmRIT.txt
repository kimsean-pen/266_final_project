She said its tough but it's clear
To look at errors with fear
Who walks in devine
You've been abused by the time

Oh there she cries
She says, she's got to thank her mother
Got to thank her mother
For her radio voice

Trying to hide
Doesn't like her school or her job
When she can't see the point
Says education is flawed
Well we're just bodies in the ground

So she, she stills wants to thank
She wants to thank her mother
She'd like to thank her mother
For her radio voice
Her radio voice

It keeps her outside
And that's the pet from at home
It better be a caller on the phone
Baby, you're not so alone
Even still she says, she wants to thank her mother
For her radio voice.
