Make room! Make room!
Down on the coffin there's a coffin or two
Dead chic, so cool
The cannibals are starvin' when they're lookin' at you

Tank tops, jet stream
Karate lessons with a killin' machine
White lines, nose bleeds
I know you get excited when the cameras go
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta

Me and you and all of this livin' dead
Burnin' up in the sun, where the bodies add
Sittin' here with you, in misery
Anybody gonna come and rescue me?
La la la

Alright
Whoah!

Make room! Make room!
One day, you're gonna have explainin' to do
Drag star, so cool
There's only room for one man and the one is you, you, you

Me and you and all of these livin' dead
Burnin' up in the sun, where the bodies add
Got a taste for the cash and androgyny
Anybody wanna come and rescue me?

Alright, oh

Well, alright
Well, alright
Well, alright
Well, alright
Well, alright

Well, alright
Well, alright
She's alright
Everybody in the room is alright

Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die!

Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die!

Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die!

We are never gonna change the world
We are never gonna change the world
'Cause we are never gonna die!

Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die!

Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die!

Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die!

Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die!

Make room!
