Come on and rest your head
And I'll protect you
You've been running too far
Strullin for fear
You've gotta stop sometime soon

Pushing through barriers and pushing through seas
And a witch will come for you
You've been running up hills and running too slow
I just keep on running, keep on running
Look what you find, look what you find

Come on and rest your head
And I will protect you
Come now, come on and rest your head
You've gotta stop sometime soon

Your power's so strong and if you don't know why
There's deeper knowing in that big old sky
Could see in the wrong place at the right time
I just keep on running, keep on running
Stick to the spars

Come on and rest your head
And I will protect you
Come now, come on and rest your head
You've gotta stop sometime soon
