(Pierce)

Lord, help me out
I'd take my life, but I'm in doubt
Just where my soul will lie
Deep in the Earth or way up in the sky

Lord can you hear me when I call?
Lord can you hear me when I call?
Lord can you hear me when I call?
Lord can you hear me, hear me at all?

Oh, oh my love has left my side
Can't get enough of life to keep me satisfied
I lost about everything
Lord, look what state I'm in

Lord can you hear me when I call?
Lord can you hear me when I call?
Lord can you hear me when I call?
Lord can you hear me, hear me at all?

Lord can you hear me when I call?
Lord can you hear me, hear me at all?
