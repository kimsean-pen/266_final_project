Day in the night
taking places in the train to Moscow

Now I'm coming back to drink some iced vodka.
Landscape in white
sun is shining through the icicles

I'm dancing in the snow to balalaikas.

Time can go by but the Russian girls
don't ever seem to leave my mind
Fine
don't see why I should even try
to leave my heart behind.

U.S.S.R. - I'm back into the U.S.S.R.

U.S.S.R. - I'm back into the U.S.S.R.!

Jumpin' is right
now this time I'm on vacation

And I'm going to have some fun rocking in Gorki Park.
Time can go by but the Russian girls
don't ever seem to leave my mind

U.S.S.R. - I'm back into the U.S.S.R.

U.S.S.R. - I'm back into the U.S.S.R.

U.S.S.R. - I'm back into the U.S.S.R.
