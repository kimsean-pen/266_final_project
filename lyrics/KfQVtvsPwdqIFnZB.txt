Take an eye for an eye
take a tooth for a tooth
just like they say in the bible
never leave a trace or forget a face
of any man at the table
when the moon is a cold chiseled dagger
sharp enough to draw blood from a stone
he rides through your dreams on a coach and horses
and the fence posts in the moonlight look like bones
Well they've stopped trying to hold him
with mortar, stone and chain
he broke out of every prison
boots mount the staircase
the door is flung back open
he's not there for he has risen
he's not there for he has risen
Some say he once killed a man with a guitar string
he's been seen at the table with kings
well he once saved a baby from drowning
there are those who say beneath his coat there are wings
some say they fear him
Well, some say they fear him
others admire him
because he steals his promise
one look in his eye
everyone denies
ever having met him
ever having met him
He can turn himself into a stranger
well they broke a lot of canes on his hide
he was born away in a cornfield
a fever beats in his head just like a drum inside
Some say they fear him
others admire him
because he steals his promise
one look in his eye
everyone denies
ever having met him
ever having met him
