I heard a voice through the discord
Of a deluge of passers-by
And I saw one gaze frozen in time
Watching me passing by

And I swear I'll know your face in the crowd
And I'll hear your voice so loud
When you're whispering

Hey unfaithful I will teach you
To be stronger, to be stronger
Hey ungraceful I will teach you
To forgive one another

Here's my kiss to betray
(Kiss to betray)
Desperate to brush the lips of grace
(Brush the lips of grace)
Do you feel hollow when you think of how I lied?

Oh sweet angel of mercy with your grace like the morning
Wrap your loving arms around me
Oh sweet angel of mercy with your grace like the morning
Wrap your loving arms around me

Hey unfaithful I will teach you
To be stronger, to be stronger
Hey ungraceful I will teach you
To forgive one another

Hey unfaithful I will teach you
To be stronger, to be stronger
Hey unloving I will love you
I will love you I will love you

And Jesus I'm ready to come home
Jesus, I'm ready to come home
(Home)
Home
(Home)

I'm ready to come hey unfaithful
Hey ungraceful hey unloving
I will love you
Hey unloving
(Hey unloving)
I will love you
