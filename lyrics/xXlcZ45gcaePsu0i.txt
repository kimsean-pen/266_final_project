Wherever you're going
I wanna go
Wherever you headed
You let me know

Don't mind catching up
I'm on my way
Just can't take the thought
Of you miles away

And I know you're going somewhere
To make a better life
I hope that you find it
On the first try

And even though it kills me
That you have you go
I know that I'll be sadder
If you never hit the road, so

Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that
You were here, that somebody's me

I will write to tell you
What's going on
But you won't miss nothing
But the same old song

If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend a day
Telling you stories
About a land far way

(But I know)
And I know you're going somewhere
To make a better life
I hope that you find it

On the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have you go
I know that I'll be sadder

If you never hit the road, so
Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that

You were here
Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that

You were here, that somebody's me
And I'm gonna try to hold it all in
Try to hold back my tears
So it don't make you stay here, yeah
I'm'a try to be a big girl now
'Cause I don't wanna be
The reason you don't leave
Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that
You were here
Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that
You were here, that somebody's me
