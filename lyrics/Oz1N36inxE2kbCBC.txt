Impersonate yourself
It looks all wrong
The mannequin's ascending to another realm
You dance around your worth
You count it out
The fabric tears completely
And disappears

Dry your eyes
Tear them open
Peel the lids back on every one

And once you're gone, still echoing
Into the space we left between
And I remember when you couldn't stand
Holding onto me, so long

I dry off all the ink
In the bright lights
The marquee is defective
It never shines
Impersonate yourself
It looks alright
The mirror cracks completely
In another realm

From where I am there's a different view
You can't compare the reflection
It looks all wrong from a higher point
It never shines when you want it

Dry your eyes
Tear them open
Peel the lids back on every one

And once you're gone, still echoing
Into the space we left between
And I remember when you couldn't stand
Holding onto me, so long

And once you're gone, still echoing
Into the space we left between
And I remember when you couldn't stand
Holding onto me, so long

Impersonate yourself
It looks all wrong
The mannequin's ascending to another realm
