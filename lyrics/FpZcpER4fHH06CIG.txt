Everybody knows your name
You leave a lasting impression
No one will hide, don't love your imperfections
You left to wake up in some dark dimension

Looking for a death to order us
Hanging when you run

I'll be on the run
Gone until I'm found
Chasing better dreams
Repeat myself to sleep

I don't want to live forever
Don't wanna die at all
Found out what your love is made of
Not the same as mine

I will not run, that's what you want
Merely endless blood

I'll be on the run
Gone until I'm found
Chasing better dreams
Repeat myself to sleep
I said repeat myself to sleep

Oh, I've been caught
I'm a rotten lover to the core
Oh, I've been caught
I'm a rotten lover to the core

I'll be on the run
Gone until I'm found
Chasing other dreams
Repeat myself to sleep
I said the reaper's in my sleep

Away, away
Away, away
