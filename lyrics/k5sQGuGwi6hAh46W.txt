Safety pins
Holding up the things
That make you mine
About your hair

You needn't care
You look beautiful
All of the time

Shine, shine, shine on
Yes
Won't you shine, shine on
Your magazines

The people at the seams
But you still read
I must admit
I don't believe in it
But I see how
You get sucked in
Shine, shine, shine on
Yes

Won't you shine, shine on
(Sha, la, la, la)
Shine, shine, shine on
Yes

Won't you shine
Shine on
Because your not done
Why do you bite the hand that feeds you?
Why do you?
Why do you bite the hand that feeds...?

Shine, shine, shine on
Yes!
Won't you shine, shine on
(Sha, la, la, la)
Shine, shine, shine on
Yes!
Wont you shine, shine on
Safety pins
Holding up the things
That make you mine
About your hair
You needn't care
You look beautiful
All of the time
