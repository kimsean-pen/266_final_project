Wake up go to sleep repeat infinite (Infinite)
Forever talking and nobody listening (Listening)
One day I'll wake up and see things are different (Different)
Hopes by the plenty I don't get em no difference (Difference)
I've been trying my best and I still can't shake it
I've been trying my hardest, I never really been too good at changing
Been too good at changing
Been too good at changing
