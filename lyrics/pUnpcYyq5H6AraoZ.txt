The hardest thing is rendering a
Moment moving too fast to endure
But you abide and smile wide cause
I want to remember this for sure
You can give me guns and politics and
Ill just make a mess of it, ya know
Give me all the sustinance and the
Wiser, wider part of me will show, yeahhhh yeah yeah

A picture says with sight
What we can't say with words
But you've been walking eyes to feet in dark sunglasses
A picture will survive
So smile and look alive
The camera lens is opening, the wider angle's yours

Yeah every empty one of us have methods
To quell the madness of this pace
But yours have bled and running south like
Dollar store mascara down your face
You could take that wait and all that fuss so
Now just get the best of us, ya know
Give me love not suicide and the
Wise, wider part of me will show yeahhhh yeahhh

A picture says with sight
What we can't say with words
But you've been walking eyes to feet in dark sunglasses
A picture will survive
So smile and look alive
The camera lens is opening, the wider angle's yoursssssss

Look alive, smile
Smile and look alive
Smile, smile and look alive
Yeahhh woah ohhhh

A picture says with sight
What we can't say with words
But you've been walking eyes to feet in dark sunglasses
A picture will survive
So smile and look alive

A picture says with sight
What we can't say with words
But you've been walking eyes to feet in dark sunglasses
A picture will survive
So smile and look alive
The camera lens is opening, the wider angle's yours

Look alive
Smile, smile and look alive
Yeah, smile and look alive
Yeahhhhhhhh woah!
