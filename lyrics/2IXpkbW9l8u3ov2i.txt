You got eyes so azure
You got blood orange skin
Are there's a spark in your centre that's piercing me in
I got a night-time shudder and a lion within
I got a brain-tricked hunger and you're pulling me in
High above the smokestacks
Throwing my soul
Throwing my soul
Quiet in jet black
Hoping I will carry you (carry you)
Above the smokestacks
Throwing my soul
Throwing my soul
Taking our minds back
Hoping I will carry you (carry you)
Carry you home
You got a downtown fire
Like a shot in the dark
You got a mad beaming on you and a hot wide eyed spark
I got a body of wonder and an emerald mind
I'm on a luminous heavy to put gold in my eyes
High above the smokestacks
Throwing my soul
Throwing my soul
Quiet in jet black
Hoping I will carry you (carry you)
Above the smokestacks
Throwing my soul
Throwing my soul
Taking our minds back
Hoping I will carry you (carry you)
Carry you home
You got eyes so azure
You got blood orange skin
Are there's a spark in your centre that's piercing me in
I got a night-time shudder and a lion within
I got a brain-tricked hunger and you're pulling me in
