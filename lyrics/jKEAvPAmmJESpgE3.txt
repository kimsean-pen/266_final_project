Today is the day, the worst day of my life
You're so content it hurts me, I don't know why
The cost of misery is at an all time high
I keep it hidden
Close to the surface, inside

I'm learning to fall, I can hardly breathe
When I'm going down don't worry 'bout me
Don't try this at home, pretend you don't see
I don't wanna know that you know it should have been me

Could you be with him or was it just a lie?
He doesn't get you like I do & you don't know why
You change your clothes & your hair but I can't change your mind
Oh, I'm uninvited, so unrequited, now

I'm learning to fall, I can hardly breathe
When I'm going down don't worry 'bout me
Don't try this at home, pretend you don't see
I don't wanna know that you know it should have been me

Words screaming in my head, why did you leave?
And I can't stop dreaming, watching you & him
When it should have been, it should have been me

Today is the day, the worst day of my life

I'm learning to fall, I can hardly breathe
When I'm going down don't worry 'bout me
Don't try this at home, pretend you don't see
I don't wanna know that you know it should have been me

Whoa, whoa
(I'm learning to fall, I can hardly breathe)
(I don't wanna know that you know, it should have been me)
(Tell me that you know, it should have been me)
Whoa, whoa
(Don't try this at home, pretend you don't see)
I don't want to know that you know, it should've been me)
Whoa, whoa
(I'm learning to fall, I can hardly breathe)
(I don't wanna know that you know, it should have been me)
(Tell me that you know, it should have been me)
Whoa, whoa
(Don't try this at home, pretend you don't see)
(I don't wanna know that you know, it should've been me)
