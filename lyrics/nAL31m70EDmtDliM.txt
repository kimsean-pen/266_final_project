We are not a sentimental age
We don't want our parent's china or their ticker tape parades
We are not a sentimental age
We're out getting high on fire escapes
We are hooking up with strangers we will never see again
We are not a sentimental age
We are not a sentimental age

When I dream, we're all melting together
Synchronized in a mass embrace
Beads of water folding together
Like a north shore wave
How strange
We're parts of each other how strange
I'll never even know your name

(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)

We are not a sentimental age
On our shoulders is a boulder of a debt we cannot pay
We are not a sentimental age
Diagnosis says I tend to disengage
I'd rather have my privacy, I'd rather have my space
These are just the pills I have to take
We are not a sentimental age

When I dream, we're all melting together
Synchronized in a mass embrace
Beads of water folding together
Like a north shore wave
How strange
We're parts of each other how strange
I'll never even know your name

(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)

I'll never even know your name

(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)

I'll never even know your name

We are not a sentimental age
We don't want our parent's china or their ticker tape parades
We are not a sentimental age
We are not a sentimental age
