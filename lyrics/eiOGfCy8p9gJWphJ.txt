We were walking
Just the other day, yeah
It was so hot outside
Aw, you could fry an egg
Remember, you were talking
And I watched as sweat ran down your face
Reached up, and I caught it at your chin
Licked my fingertips

We were, we were (oo)
Just wasting time (wasting time)
Let the hours roll by
Doing nothing for the fun (oo)
A little taste of the good life
Whether right or wrong (right or wrong)
Makes us want to stay, stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile

Then later on, the Sun began to fade
And then, well, the clouds rolled over our heads
And it began to rain
Oh, we were dancing, mouths open
We were splashing and the tongue taste
And for a moment this good time would never end

You and me, you and me
Just wasting time (wasting time)
I was kissing you (kissing you)
You were kissing me love (oo)
From good day into the moonlight
Now, a night so fine (night so fine)
Makes us wanna stay, stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile

(Make you wanna, makes you wanna)
(Make me wanna, makes me wanna stay)
(Don't it make you wanna?)

Wasting time
I shall miss this thing when it all rolls by
What a day
Wanna stay, stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile

Hey, love (hey, love)
Oh, just groping you
Rolling in the mud (oo, oh, yeah)
Stay a while (stay a while, stay a while)
Oh, come on, love (come on, love)
Wanna stay, stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile

(Makes me wanna, makes me wanna stay)
(Makes me wanna, makes me wanna stay)
(Makes me wanna, makes me wanna stay)
(Makes me wanna, makes me wanna stay)
(Makes me wanna, makes me wanna stay)
(Makes me wanna, makes me wanna stay)
(Makes me wanna, makes me wanna stay)
(Makes me wanna, makes me wanna stay)
(Makes me wanna, makes me wanna stay)
(Don't it? makes me wanna stay)
(Don't it make you wanna stay?)
(Don't it make you wanna stay?)
(Don't it make you wanna stay?)
(Don't it make you wanna stay?)
(Don't it make you wanna stay?)
(Don't it make you wanna stay?)
(Don't it make you wanna stay?)
(Don't it make you wanna stay?)
(Don't it make you wanna stay?)
(Don't it make you wanna stay?)
(Don't it make you wanna stay?)
(Don't it make you wanna stay?)
(Don't it make you wanna, make you wanna stay?)
