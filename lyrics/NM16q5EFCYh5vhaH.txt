She'll come, she'll go
She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky odour
The lady from another grinning soul

Cologne she'll wear
Silver and American card
She'll drive a Beatle car

And beat you down at cool Canasta
And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afrai-ai-aid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress

She will be your living end
She'll come, she'll go
She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view?

And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afrai-ai-aid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
