When everything is going wrong
Things are just a little strange
It's been so long now
You've forgotten how to smile

And overhead the skies are clear
But it still seems to rain on you
And your only friends all have
Better things to do

When you're down and lost
And you need a helping hand
When you're down and lost
Along the way

Oh, just tell yourself
I'll, I'll be ok

Now things are only getting worse
And you need someone to take the blame
When your lover's gone
There's no-one to share the pain

You're sleeping with the TV on
And you're lying in an empty bed
All the alcohol in the world
Would never help me to forget

When you're down and lost
And you need a helping hand
When you're down and lost
Along the way

Just try a little harder
Try your best to make it through the day
Oh, just tell yourself
I'll, I'll be ok

You're not alone
(You're not alone)
You're not alone
(You're not alone)
You're not alone

Oh, just tell yourself
I'll, I'll be ok
Oh, just tell yourself
I'll, I'll be ok
Won't you tell yourself, I'll

When you're down and lost
And you need a helping hand
When you're down and lost
Along the way

Try a little harder
Try your best to make it through the day
Oh, just tell yourself
I'll, I'll be ok

I'll, I'll be ok
I'll, I'll be ok
