Your heart is a diamond
Every soul wants to steal it
From your fort, your fort of skin
You let nobody in

Your heart is a diamond
A bleeding treasure
Crushed together by grief and violence
Tons of pain, big pressure

Your heart is a diamond
So hard and cold
So uncut and so silent
In a breathing vault

That's my heart
Let me help it feel
That's my heart
What they all want to steal

Your heart is a diamond
Every man wants to steal it
Deep inside your fort of skin
You keep yourself concealed

Good hearts, so hard to find
I will wait and stay
A diamond ring will take its place
Around my soul one day

That's my heart
Let me help it feel
That's my heart
What they all want to steal

That's my heart
Let me work that mine
That's my heart
Help me, help make it shine

I lick your heart, I taste the pain
Try your blood it feels the same
I kiss your skin, your bitter lips
There is no light at the end of the tunnel between your hips

That's my heart
Let me help it feel
Let it me into dark
What they all want to steal

That's my heart
Let me work that mine
That's my heart
Help me, help make it shine
