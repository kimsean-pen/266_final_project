If my man was fighting

Some unholy war
I would be behind him
Straight sup beside him
With strength he didn't know
It's you I'm fighting for
He can't lose with me in tow
I refuse to let him go
At his side and drunk on pride

We wait for the blow

Put it in writing
But who you writing for
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done,
Reciting my stomach standing still
Like you reading my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
And I'll battle 'til this bitter finale
Just me, my dignity and this guitar case
Woah, woah
If, if my man is fighting some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
But who you dying for
B - I would have died too
I'd have liked too
If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
If my man was fighting
