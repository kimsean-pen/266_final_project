You won't see your own home again
You won't see the old ancient
You will tell yourself it will be ok
You will take the liberty
You will serve the holy sentence
'Till it transpires in your vision

[?] Who are you? Who are you?
Will you become [?] to be
Spreading your disease on one sunny afternoon
Glory be [?]
Who are you? Who are you?
Who are you? Who are you?
