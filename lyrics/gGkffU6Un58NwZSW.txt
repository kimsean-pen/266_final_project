I wanna put the happy in your birthday
And I wanna be the merry in your Christmas
I'm always giving thanks for you on every Thanksgiving
Sure as the sun will rise
I need you
I wanna be the bunny in your Easter
And I wanna kiss you every New Year's Eve
You'll bring my heart to life
Make everything all right
I thank God you came to me

Every hour of the day
(Every hour of the day)
Every day of the week
(Every day of the week)
I need you
(I need you)
Every week of the year
(Every week of the year)
Every year of my life
(Every year of my life)
To kiss you, to love you
To hold you, to hug you
I need you, I need you
Oh please

I never lose sight of the reasons that I love you
I wanna be your forever Valentine
You make me the woman that I always wanted to be
You make my life feel like a dream

Every hour of the day
(Every hour of the day)
Every day of the week
(Every day of the week)
I need you
(I need you)
Every week of the year
(Every week of the year)
Every year of my life
(Every year of my life)
To kiss you, to love you
To hold you, to hug you
I need you, I need you
Oh please

You are the light in my heart of darkness
You are not like
Anyone I've ever met
You are the light under the door
You are the baby love angel
I won't forget you rescued me

Every hour of the day
(Every hour of the day)
Every day of the week
(Every day of the week)
I need you
(I need you)
Every week of the year
(Every week of the year)
Every year of my life
(Every year of my life)
To kiss you, to love you
To hold you, to hug you
I need you, I need you
Oh please
