As we lay side by side
Carried only by the tide
Look upon on the moonlit sky
As the waves come crashing from the south
We start to come alive

Take a breath and so will I
Spin around and make good dive
On the bottom of the ocean bank
On the bottom we start to come alive
We start to come alive, so c'mon now

We gotta keep on moving on and on
We gotta keep on moving to stay strong
We gotta keep on moving, I feel numb so cmon
We gotta stay strong

We stay and the lights go by
In a dream we're flying high
On the shore of the coastal line
On the shore we start to come alive
We start to come alive

As we drift far and wide
Carried only by the tide
Move on, don't ask why
As the sun comes shining from the south
We start to come alive, so c'mon now

We gotta keep on moving on and on
We gotta keep on moving to stay strong
We gotta keep on moving, I feel numb so cmon
We gotta stay strong As we lay side by side
Carried only by the tide
Look upon the moonlit sky
In a dream we're flying high
We gotta stay strong
