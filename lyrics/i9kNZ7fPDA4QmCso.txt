You kept your secrets
You kept your heart on your sleeve
You kept your mind at ease
And you are such a tease
It was the way you looked at me

And I know we're never gonna live in
The same home when I'll be working you out
And I'll fold to check out what the deal is

You're alone

Oh baby you glow
You glow, you glow,
You glow, you glow, all over me
and I know, I know,
I know, I know what we can be
oh what we can be
You show, you show
You show, you show me things I never seen
and You know, you know

You know, you know
you know, what we can be, oh what we can be

oh, i have to jump over hurdles
left and right
It took days and nights
I was over my head
But that's alright

And I know we're never gonna live in
The same home when I'll be working you out
And I'll phone to check out what the deal is

You're alone
Oh baby you glow
You glow, you glow,
You glow, you glow all over me
and I know, I know,
I know, I know what we could be
know what we could be
You show, you show
you show
you showed me things I never see
you know
i know, i know
i know what we could be
know what we could be
know what we could be, know what we can be
show me things that i have never seen
know what we could be, know what we could be,
show me things that i have never seen
End
