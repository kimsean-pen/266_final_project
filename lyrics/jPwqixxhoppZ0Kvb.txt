So we got away
So we run back
To the kid that you were
For a couple days
Everything and that you possessed
It was yours

It started slow, it started late
It started strong, then we lost faith
Started slow, started to lose control
The more we accelerated

With your hollow eyes
You keep coming back
It begins to transform
Can you spend the night?
Can you be around?
In the eye of the storm

It started slow, it started late
It started strong, then we lost faith
Started slow, started to lose control
The more we accelerated
The more we accelerated

Can I send this kiss right to you now?
'Cause the risk belongs with you somehow
Can I return this kiss that you gave?
Already know it's borrowed anyway
Was the risk I sent to you received?
All the words you said to me believed
I'm already over the thrill of pursuit
When can I take the risk I took with you?
Send this kiss to someone new

So you're beaten up
Well, you bounce back
It's all part of the pull
And the story runs like a soundtrack
We were deemed to withhold

Started slow, started late
Started strong, then we lost faith
Started slow
Started to lose control
The more we accelerate
The more we accelerate

Can I send this kiss right to you now?
'Cause the risk belongs with you somehow
Can I return this kiss that you gave?
Already know it's borrowed anyway
Was the risk I sent to you received?
All the words you said to me believed
I'm already over the thrill of pursuit
When can I take the risk I took with you?
Send this kiss to someone new

Something's going on
Find some daylight
There's another way to leave the Garden of Eden
And I'm inclined to try
Find some daylight
Open my eyes
There's another way to leave the Garden of Eden
And I'm inclined to try
