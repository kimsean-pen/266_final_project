Stand, stand to attention
The moment's passed you by
Now is the rest of your life
Dare dare I to mention
Your laughter makes me cry
A speck of dust in my eye

And I am unafraid and blissful, here I come
I am unashamed at getting nothing done
I'm a cavalcade that tumbles one by one
But I'm okay just like Jesus' son

Bone, bone of contention
I've lost the count of times
I've seen you fucking goodbye
So good, orderly direction
To pull you from the mire
Your universe on fire

And I am unafraid and blissful, here I come
I am unashamed at getting nothing done
I'm a cavalcade that tumbles one by one
But I'm okay just like Jesus' son

And I am unafraid and blissful, here I come
I am unashamed at getting nothing done
I'm a cavalcade that tumbles one by one
But I'm okay just like Jesus' son

But I'm okay just like Jesus' son
I'm okay just like Jesus' son
I'm okay just like Jesus' son
