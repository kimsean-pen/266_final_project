Sun, sun

Spirits move me, every time I'm near you
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind
(Da da) You're my life line, (woh woh woh) angel of my lifetime
Answer to all answers I can find

Baby I want you come, come, come into my arms
Let me feel the wonder of all of you
Could it be magic now, now, now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last?

Sun, sun
Sun, sun

(Take me)
Baby take me high upon a hillside
High up where the stallion meets the sun
I could love you, yeah build my world around you
Never leave you till my life is done

Baby I want you come, come, come into my arms
Let me feel the wonder of all of you
Could it be magic now, now, now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last?

Woh woh woh time
Woh woh woh take me
Woh woh woh time
Woh woh woh

Could it be magic now, now, now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last?
Baby I want you come, come, come into my arms
Let me feel the wonder of all of you
Could it be magic now?
