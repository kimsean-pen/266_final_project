Dirty little secret
Dirty little lies
Say your prayers and comb your hair
Save your soul tonight

Drift among the faithful
Bury your desires
Aberrations fill your head
You need a place to hide, and I am

Do you remember me?
And the kid I used to be?
Do you remember me?

When your world comes crashing down
I want to be there (If God is looking down on me)
I'm not Jesus, Jesus wasn't there!

You confess it all away
But it don't mean shit to me (If God is looking down on me)
I'm not Jesus, I will not forgive!

No I won't!
No I won't!

I thought you were a good man
I thought you talked to God
You hippocratic, messianic, child abusing turned satanic

Do you remember me?
Do you remember me?
And the kid I used to be?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?

When your whole world comes undone
Let me be the one to say (If God is looking down on me)
I'm not Jesus, you can't run away!

And the innocence you spoiled
Find a way to live (If God is looking down on me)
I'm not Jesus, I will not forgive!

I will not forgive
I won't be whatever you wanted
I will not forgive
I won't be whatever you wanted

Do you remember me?
And the kid I used to be?
Not the same as I used to be?
Oh, do you remember my name?

When your world comes crashing down
I want to be there (If God is looking down on me)
I'm not Jesus, Jesus wasn't there!

You confess it all away
But it don't mean shit to me (If God is looking down on me)
I'm not Jesus, I will not...
I'm not Jesus, I will not forgive, yeah!
Oh, I will not forgive, yeah, yeah!
No, I will not forgive!
