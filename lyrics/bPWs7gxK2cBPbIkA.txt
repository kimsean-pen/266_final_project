It seems so long
But life is so short
The things that I've seen
The things I ignore
Seem so far away
But I feel it more now than ever

It's collectively
Snuck up on me
Though I'm awake to the notion
That time isn't real
We're just here to feel
It's made unclear by the motion

I can't believe
I can't deny
That all this time has gone by
But I am still here
I'm still alive
So while my heart is beating
I'll keep giving my life...

Now turn the tape off
Is this recording
Or am I dissolving?
The carbon date is wrong
I'm here in the moment
But now that it's gone
I'll count all my blessings
Before they move on

I can't believe
I can't deny
That all this time has gone by
But i am still here
I'm still alive
So while my heart is beating
I'll be giving my life

This could be the day
That I've waited for
Just to be sure
I'll give you everything
Oh, take it all
(Oh take it)

Oh i can't believe
No i can't deny
That all this time has gone by

But i am still here
I'm still alive
So while my heart is beating
I cant believe
I can't deny
That all this time has gone by
But I am still here
I'm still alive
So i'll keep giving my life
