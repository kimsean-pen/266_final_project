Welcome to the truth
a life that's not your own.
Controlled by labor, printed paper
and corruptors of the world.
Synthetic lie collect our minds to the beast
We've had the rug pulled from under our feet.

Media terrorist thrive of deciet.
spoonfeeding bullshit served by elites.

society's harnessing fear as a weapon.
The time has come for all to see.
The men behind the curtain cast at you disease.
Take back the light
its a dangerous place we're
headed for if we accept defeat.
Now we know its a show
theyve been running from the low

Reach out to the ground
beneath the faulty agitated
glistening.
Under the wings of a golden era.

Listening
to the hate they created inside as we grow.
As we reduce their religion to ghosts
as we reduce them all to bones.

The time has come for all to see
The men behind the curtain writhe in self defeat
When will the world seek truth within.
The eye in silence grips the knowledge to begin.
Reverse whats lost awake the song within you.
rejoice aloud, let these words imbue.
Reverse whats lost awake the song within you.
Rejoice aloud let these words imbue.
Shape? the future, Shifting power
back in the hands of the common man.
Give some hell for existance!
Pouring blood on the path they've set in stone.
As we reclaim our position to the throne.
As we reduce them all to bones.
