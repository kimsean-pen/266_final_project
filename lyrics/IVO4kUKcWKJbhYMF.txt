How am I supposed to survive
If I don't know what's wrong and what's right
How am I supposed to know freedom?
If I don't know, I'm living inside
Cuz you've got the nail to my all
My origins ain't nobody's work
You've got the nail to my all
A numb tic-tok can't even control

Set me free
Pull the nail out with your teeth
Set me free
Don't leave me wasted

Slave hits the coal
And every luck is turned to gray
Sounds try to talk
And the words make sense in their own way
But? is a slave through it's owner
And I won't let nobody take it over
No, I won't let nobody take it over
And all my whole like I won't turn a shoulder
To the visions that keep us divided
Can't hold on the cry that keep me who I am

Set me free
Pull the nail out with your teeth
Set me free
Don't leave me wasted

Set me free
Pull the nail out with your teeth
Set me free
Don't leave me wasted
