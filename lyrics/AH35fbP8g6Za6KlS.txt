Fuck the world

They never see me coming
Their faces twisted in shock
Now the fools come gunning
To put our heads to the black
Sick of the laughter
Sick of the pain
Sick of the feeling
This feeling of shame
Sick of white folks privil eged and vain
Protesting a culture that isn't the same
Don't blame the false elites
When nazi assholes march the streets
So call me a hypocrite call me a fake
It's nothing compared to your pride and your hate

Dead
Dead and bloated
There's times are volatile
There's no room left for you
Dead
Dead and bloated
There's no room left for you
There's times are volatile

Volatile
Volatile

Volatile
Volatile

This world is fucking volatile

Fuck the World

You'll never see me coming
Sick of the racists
Sick of the shit
Sick of them telling me it's immigrants
Sick of the phonies on my phone screen
Sick of the NRA trying to scare me
Stop crying innocence
Stop claiming self-defense
Good men won't speak because they're scared of the violence
But bad men keep screaming to fill up the silence

Dead
Dead and bloated
There's times are volatile
There's no room left for you
Dead
Dead and bloated
There's no room left for you
There's times are volatile

Volatile

This world is fucking volatile
