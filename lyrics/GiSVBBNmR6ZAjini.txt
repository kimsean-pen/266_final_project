Time away I thought I saw you
Walking in place, quite
Lost in your ways
They don't understand yet
Lost in the summer goes time

New year
We're runnin' soon
I know fear
In the afternoon

Problem solver,
Whats the answer?
New solutions to
Issues elder
If I go searching for
Better weather
Will I love home
More than I have ever?

In my room
No one ever says things like they do
Gone too soon
I don't understand yet what we do

New year
I'm livin' through
I know fear
In the afternoon

Problem solver,
Whats the answer?
New solutions to
Issues elder
If I go searching for
Better weather
Will I love home
More than I have ever?
