I'm going to give you a coming-out party, at your house
It's perfect, you can't refuse, it's my gift to you, it's your fantasy

Fantasia, having a party is not my idea of a fantasy
Especially right now

The party isn't the fantasy
I know what you'd like, it's the fantasy you once told me about
Remember?

I don't remember telling you about it
What is it? What's the fantasy?
