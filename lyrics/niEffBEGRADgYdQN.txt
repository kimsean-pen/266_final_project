Let me take you on a funky ride
All around the world
And ahh, if you let me give inside your mind
Feel your spirits fly

Oh baby, would you like to take a little ride with me
Unleash your sexual fantasies, it would be so nice
Ahh, relax your body next to me, as I sing this Outkast melody
On this funky ride, so just relax baby

Let me take you on a funky ride
All around the world
And ahh, if you let me give inside your mind
Feel your spirits fly

Now baby, now the smoke is in the air
Martel and coke has got me there
And we wonder why you're high?, Well baby umm, it's nothin' but that
Sess in your chest that got you feelin' kinda crazy
So let your spirits fly, uhh and enjoy the ride, oh yeah baby

Let me take you on a funky ride
All around the world
And ahh, if you let me give inside your mind
Feel your spirits fly

Let me take you on a funky ride
All around the world
If you let me give inside your mind
Feel your spirits fly

Let me take you on a funky ride
All around the world
If you let me give inside your mind
Feel your spirits fly

Let me take you on a funky ride
All around the world
If you let me give inside your mind
Feel your spirits fly

Let me take you on a funky ride
All around the world
If you let me give inside your mind
Feel your spirits fly

Let me take you on a funky ride
All around the world
If you let me give inside your mind
Feel your spirits fly
