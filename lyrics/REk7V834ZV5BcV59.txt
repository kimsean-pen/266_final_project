You said you'd cried a thousand times.
But I don't believe a word of it.
You loved it when my heart stopped
So you start to listen.

Just stop and listen!
Don't test my words!

Just believe!
I did believe!
Just believe!
I did believe!
Who am I to say?

Fall Amy, fly,
You can't lie your way out of this one.
Fall Amy, fly,
You can't lie your way out of this one.

Put faith aside!
We have no way of knowing
How short our tie is!
Before the Devil knows your dead,
There will be blood,
There will be blood!
Now you know just how I feel!

Fall Amy, fly,
You can't lie your way out of this one.
Fall Amy, fly,
You can't lie your way out of this one.

(Oh baby, just maybe you're not the one)
(Oh baby, just maybe you're not the one)

The fall, will destroy at the end of it all!
And after it all, the hopes of the sinners will lose hope and break for me!

Oh baby, just maybe you're not the one!
You never were!
It was all sympathy and simple words of nothingness,
Nothingness!

This is where you die!
This is where you die!
