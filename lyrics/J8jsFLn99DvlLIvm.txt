In your heart
Lies a devotion for starting bargain
To turn your crown away in the mayhem
you pledged a legion through gold
in your heart

with smoking mirrors you rain

time will show
throwing your whole
into the fire
vengence cause
one day will fall my
tideway
Crushing all over here
come tether this moment of lies
until my fear remains
turn away
beware don't be led astray
by motions that turn our temple
to a house of dream

sleep up in

proclaiming lies like a guardless coward
until your senses are narrow

tideway
crushing all over here
come tether this moment of lies
until my fear remains
Turn away
Beware don't be led astray
By motions that turn our temple
To a house of dream

And i know
Yes i know
That all the little things
Are coming back to hurt you
Letting you down in the air
Colliding with your dreams
And burning all you still hope

turn away
don't be led astray
from false perceptions
no more lies
no more disguise
no false pretenders

stand your ground
don't wander away
don't fall apart
ask yourself
in trouble am i
my brothers cleaver
