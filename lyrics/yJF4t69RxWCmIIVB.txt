Well now you're here
You are in your life
And now you're finding out why
You've got to learn how to fight
Before you learn how to fly

So stick your fist up prove them wrong
Don't lose the words to the song
'Cause it's a long way down
I guess you know that by now

But if you hold on
Well I will hold on too
And if you reach up
Yeah I will reach up too

Well now you're here in your life
It's such a long way down
Somehow you figure it out
So now you turn it around
But I know

But if you hold on
Well I will hold on too
And if you reach up
Yeah I will reach up too

Too... too, too.

And one thing before you go
Just let everyone know
You refuse to regret it
Just like everyone said you would
Just like everyone knew you would

Just say that you can
Sleep at night
Just say that you get nervous
With the struggle you fight

You can't believe what you're told
And you can't be alone
And you can't let it go
And you can't lose control
And you know
You are not just anyone
No you're not just anyone

And if you hold on
Well I will hold on too
And if you reach up
Then I will reach up too
And if you hold on
And I will hold on too
And if you reach up.
