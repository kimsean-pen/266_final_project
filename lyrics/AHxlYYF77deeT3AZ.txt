Mirrors reflecting
The broken illusion of one lost
And sinful (mind)
Mind's eye protect me
While caught in this dark world of fear
And fading hope
My soul is worn

The sun lonely words
of innocence lost,
in the shades now revealed
by a fate never told.
A sea of new hope,
won't fear his reborn,
in its waters we'll wait
for the great heaven's call.

Fragments of tortured
Existence revealing cold whispers
Of lonely (ghosts)
Ghosts led by shadows
Enlightening the source of all evil
Of darkened faith
And mortal pain

The sun lonely words
of innocence lost,
in the shades now revealed
by a fate never told.
A sea of new hope,
won't fear his reborn,
in its waters we'll wait
for the great heaven's call.
The call
