Before an empty gaze
Stand to proclaim the end
The corrupt control and deliver fate
Bring ruin upon us

When we lie abject before them
Erode our being
Denounce the visceral
Absolve our fear

These are the depths of the repressed
Condemned to descend further

Awaken to the manifest
The air devoid of honour

Stained truth will blacken all
There is no more light
I will die before I succumb to indoctrination
Declare war

Revere; exalt
At the word of the vermin
Surrender

Weigh on the complicit
A black mark
Indelible shame
Their names to endure suffering
The judgement laid before me
It will not rest

The ground cannot be upturned
To retract the past
To bury sin
Our error will bear consequence

Misled by the spineless
Regress
Silenced by the callow
We cannot retreat

See the evil, falling dark
Hear the evil in clear warning
We dare not speak
