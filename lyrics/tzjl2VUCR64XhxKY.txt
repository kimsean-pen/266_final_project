One, two, three
Hit it

Keep, keep it together
Forever keep people together
Keep, keep it together
Forever keep people together

Keep, keep it together
Forever keep people together
Keep, keep it together
Forever keep people together

I got brothers
I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle
Tell you what I'm gonna do

Gonna get out of here
I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget
Every single hungry face

I'm tired of sharin' all
The hand me downs
To get attention I must
Always be the clown

I wanna be different
I wanna be on my own
But Daddy said, "Listen
You will always have a home"

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

I hit the big time
But I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger
City life can get to you

People can be so cold
Never want to turn your back
Just givin' to get something
Always wanting somethin' back

When I get lonely
And I need to be
Loved for who I am
Not what they want to see

Brothers and sisters
They've always been there for me
We have a connection
Home is where the heart should be

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

When I look back
On all the misery
And all the heartache
That they brought to me

I wouldn't change it
For another chance
'Cause blood is thicker
Than any other circumstance

Keep, keep it together
Forever keep people together
Keep, keep it together
Forever keep people together

When I get lonely
And I need to be
Loved for who I am
Not what they want to see

Brothers and sisters
They've always been there for me
We have a connection
Home is where the heart should be

When I look back
And all the misery
And all the heartache
That they brought to me

I wouldn't change it
For another chance
'Cause blood is thicker
Than any circumstance

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

Keep, keep it together
Keep people together
Forever and ever

Keep, keep it together
Keep people together
Forever and ever

Keep, keep it together
Keep people together
Forever and ever
