Pecking all at my head
She's pecking all at my head's scum
My scalp is starting to bleed from all the pecking done
How could I make it worse?
Must have been me being myself
Maybe this could work if I could just be someone else

Falling back on me
Don't forget how ruined I am
Falling back on me
Don't forget that I'm still the same

I was the ugly Earth
Ugly Earth beneath your two feet
Must have had to fall upon your knees for us to meet
Can you believe it now?
Now you have the time that you need
Find another young dumb thing and make him bleed

Falling back on me
Don't forget how ruined I am
Falling back on me
Don't forget that I'm still the same

Waking up again
The girl is mad as a hatter
Both of us know we can only see the end
Still want it to matter
