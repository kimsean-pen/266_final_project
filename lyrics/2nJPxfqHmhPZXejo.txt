Crying out, are you there?
9-1-1 is in too late
Send a sign, send a prayer
Dying for a better day
I won't make it through tomorrow
If I don't make it through today

My critical condition's holding me
Blacked out, I think I've had enough
Bright lights, waiting for Kingdom Come
No time, stand by, break the flatline
Wake up, give me a vital sign
White lights but I won't say goodbye

No time, stand by, break the flatline
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
Calling out, can you hear?
Anyone, am I okay?
Show me why, show me where

To find a place where I'll be safe
I won't live to see tomorrow
If I don't live to see today
My critical condition's killing me
Blacked out, I think I've had enough
Bright lights, waiting for Kingdom Come

No time, stand by, break the flatline
Wake up, give me a vital sign
White lights but I won't say goodbye
No time, stand by, break the flatline
Come back, you better take a breath
Come back, before there's nothing left
Come back again, come back again
Break the flatline

Come back, you better take a breath
Come back, before there's nothing left
No time, stand by, break the flatline
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Blacked out, I think I've had enough
Bright lights, waiting for Kingdom Come)
No time, stand by, break the flatline
Wake up, give me a vital sign
White lights but I won't say goodbye
No time, stand by, break the flatline
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
I've had enough
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Break the flatline
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
I've had enough
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Break the flatline
