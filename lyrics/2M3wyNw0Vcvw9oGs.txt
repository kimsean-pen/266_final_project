I get a thrill out of playing with fire
'Cause you hold your life when you hold that flame
I get a kick out of thunder and lightening
Tearing through the night, hollering your name

I get a laugh out of staring at darkness
And wondering why people live in the light
I drive fast, and I rumble the hardest
I don't feel alive if I ain't in the fight

I can't sleep when there's something to do
You spend your whole life dreaming, then you wake up dead
It's a long night, can I spend it with you?
'Cause you're oh so pretty when you stand on the edge

Oh, little darling, don't you look charming
Here in the eye of the hurricane
Real or imagined, what does it matter?
Oh, come inside, can I get you to stay?
Oh, little darling, don't you like falling
Down through the sky, like a diving plane
Real or imagined, what does it matter?
Oh, come inside, can I get you to stay?

What is life?
Only visions
When I die
I'm coming right on back for you
Who am I?
An illusion
When I lie
I'm coming right on back for you

Oh, little darling, don't you look charming
Here in the eye of the hurricane
Real or imagined, what does it matter?
Oh, come inside, can I get you to stay?
Oh, little darling, don't you get lonely?
Look in my eyes, give me one more day
Real or imagined, what does it matter?
Oh, come inside, can I get you to stay?
