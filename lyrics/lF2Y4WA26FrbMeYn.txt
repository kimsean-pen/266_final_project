the absence of god will bring you comfort, baby
and plannings for the poor so let's pretend that we're rich
and I'm not my body for how I choose to destroy it
folk singers sing songs for the working, baby
we're just recreation for all those doctors and lawyers
there's no relief for the bleeding heart
'cause they'll be losing bodies tonight

and Rob says you love love love
then you die
I've watched him while sleeping and seen him cry
with closed eyes

and you're not happy but you're funny
and I'm tripping over my joy
I just keep getting up again
we could be daytime drunks if we wanted
we'd never get anything done that way, baby
and we'd still be ruled by our duelling perspectives
and I'm not my perspective
or the lies I'll tell you every time

and Morgan says, "maybe love won't let you down
all of your failures are training grounds
and just as your back's turned, you'll be surprised," she says
"as your solitude subsides"

and like I'll teach you how to swim
if you turn the bad in me into good again

and I say there's trouble when everything is fine
the need to destroy things creeps up on me every time
and just as love's silhouette appears
I close my eyes and disappear tonight

and something's gotta change
'cause our love's the slowest-moving train
