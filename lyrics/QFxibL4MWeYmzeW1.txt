Withhold your last breath
Before you turn to stone
Forget the struggle

Cave in
While the pressure lasts
Walk...
After storms have passed

No salvation to be found
Holding me back no more
No salvation to be found
Holding me back no more
No salvation to be found
Holding me back no more

Rise
The withered flower
Dead in the sand

Eyes watching from afar
Witness the disband
Grasping at your hand

No salvation to be found
Holding me back no more
No salvation to be found
Holding me back no more
No salvation
Beyond my wings
