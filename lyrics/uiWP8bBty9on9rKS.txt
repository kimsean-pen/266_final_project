Out in the garden there's half of a heaven
We're only bluffing
We're not ones for busting through walls
But they've told us
Unless we can prove that we're doing it
We can't have it all

He's gonna wangle a way to get out of it
She's an excuse
And a witness who'll talk when he's called,
But they've told us
Unless we can prove that we're doing it
We can't have it all
We can't have it all

[spoken]
I've got a glimpse of a god
All shining and bright

Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
It all goes slow-mo
I don't know why I'm crying
Am I suspended in gaffa?
Not till I'm ready for you
Not till I'm ready for you
Can I have it all

I try to get nearer
But as it gets clearer
There's something appears in the way
It's a plank in me eye
With a camel who's trying to get through it
Am I doing it?
Can I have it all now?

I pull out the plank
And say thank you for yanking me back
To the fact that there's always something to distract
But sometimes it's hard
To know if I'm doing it right
Can I have it all now?
Can I have it all now?
Can I have it all?
I can't have it all

[spoken:]
We all have a dream... maybe.

Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
It all goes slow-mo
I don't know why I'm crying
Am I suspended in gaffa?
Not till I'm ready for you
Not till I'm ready for you
Can I have it all

I won't open boxes that I am told not to
I'm not a Pandora
I'm much more like the girl in the mirror,
Between you and me
She don't stand a chance of getting anywhere at all
Not anywhere at all
No, not a thing
She can't have it all

[spoken:]
But where are the angels?
I'm scared of the changes

Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
It all goes slow-mo
I don't know why I'm crying
Am I suspended in gaffa?
Not till I'm ready for you
Not till I'm ready for you

Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
It all goes slow-mo
I don't know why I'm crying
Am I suspended in gaffa?
Not till I'm ready for you
Not till I'm ready for you
Can I have it all now?
