spoken: Like Fungus Among Us
I treat this like my thesis.
Well-written topic
Broken down into pieces.
I introduce then produce
Words so profuse.
It's abuse how I juice up this beat
Like I'm deuce.
Two people both equal.
Like I'm Gemini
Rather simeon.
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it.
You can't stop it.
Drop it.
Your whole crew's microscopic
Like particles while I make international articles.
And on the cover
Don't discuss the baby mother business.
I been in this third LP you can't tell me, I witness.
First handed, I'm candid.
You can't stand it.
Respect demanded
And get flown around the planet.
Rock Hard Like granite or steel.
People feel like Lauryn Hill from New-Ark Israel.
And this is real.
So I keep makin' the street's ballads
While lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
I'm about to change the focus
From the richest to the brokest.
I wrote the opus
To reverse the hypnosis.
Whoever's closest
To the line's gonna win it.
You gonna fall tryin' to ball
While my team win the pennant.
I'm about to be in it.
For a minute.
Then run for the senate.
Make a slum lord be tenant.
Give his money to kids to spend it.
And then amend it.
Every law that ever prevented.
Our survival since our arrival
Documented in the Bible.
Like Moses and Aaron.
Things gon' change, that's apparent.
And all the transparent gonna
Be seen through.
Let God redeem you.
Keep your deen true.
You can get the green, too.
Watch out what you cling to.
Observe how a queen do.
And I remain calm readin the 73 Psalm.
'Cause wit all this on I got the word in palm.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
Now I be breakin' bread sippin'
Manichevitz wine.
Pay no mind party like it's 1999.
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine.
Say your rhymes, lets see if that get you out your bend.
Now I'm gonna get the mozarella like Rockefeller.
Still be in the church of Lalibela.
Singing hymns a cappella.
Whether posed in Maribella in Couture
Or collectin' residuals from off The Score.
I'm makin' sure
I'm with the 144.
I've been here before this ain't a battle this is war.
Word to Boonie
I makes a lot like Sunni.
Get diplomatic immunity in evety ghetto community.
Had opportunity went from
Hoodshock to Hood-chic
But it ain't what you cop
It's about what you keep.
And even if there are leaks
You can't capsize this ship.
'Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
You can get the money.
You can get the money.
Get the money.
Get, get the money.
Tyou can get the money. You can get the money.
You can get the money.
The final hour.
But keep your eyes,
keep your eyes
keep your eyes
on the final hour.
Now you can get the money
and you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
Final hour
Final hour
Final hour.
