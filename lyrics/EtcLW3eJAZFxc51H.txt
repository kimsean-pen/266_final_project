Did the fire even spark?
Yes, it's true, you control my heart
Even though about this is not right (?)
I'll leave alone with you tonight

Make my words go away
I'll kill this love and fade away
I feel so alone, I can't be free
(?) used to the end of me

Nothing can last forever
Suicide could be the answer (x2)

I can't even breathe
Space around me is starting freeze
Climbing stars, now I see the light
Taking me, telling me goodnight

Is this the end, cease of being?
My future is so easy to see
All this gone, all this gone
All this gone, all this gone

Nothing can last forever
Suicide could be the answer (x7)
