Lucy Rebar
She's a friend of mine
Later she'll go
Back and redefine the line
It's getting longer all the time
Oh Yeah

Drinkin' sunshine
She likes the taste of it
She had a gold mine
But then she wasted it away
You should have seen her yesterday
Oh Yeah

Sing along the way
Nothing stops the ache

Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Cosma shiva
Got off
Made you a believer
I don't need to
Tender
Why do I believe you
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby
Any way she can

Missing pieces
She's got a lot of them
Time decreases
I wish I thought of them - before
Before it's time
To close the store
Oh Yeah

Distillation
A lonely sycophant
Some liberation
The only seed
We ever plant
I wanna help you
But I can't
No no

Sing along the way
Nothing stops the ache

Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Love 'em leave 'er
Got off
Made you a believer
Neon soldiers
Left her
Now you've gotten older
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby
Any way she can

It's getting longer all the time
It's time to redesing the sign
Oh Yeah
Sing along the way.
