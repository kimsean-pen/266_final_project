She... She's the one... She... She's the one...
She's the girl who thinks nothing of breaking up two people in love

In this world of ups and downs, in this world of ups and downs
In this world of ups and downs, in this world of ups and downs
In this world of ups and downs, in this world of ups and downs
In this world of ups and downs, in this world of ups and downs

She... She's the one... She... She's the one...
Saw her again last night, I saw her with another guy

In this world of ups and downs, in this world of ups and downs
In this world of ups and downs, in this world of ups and downs
In this world of ups and downs, in this world of ups and downs
In this world of ups and downs, in this world of ups and downs

She... She's the one... She... She's the one...
In this world of ups and downs she's the one

In this world of ups and downs, in this world of ups and downs
In this world of ups and downs, in this world of ups and downs
In this world of ups and downs, in this world of ups and downs
In this world of ups and downs, in this world of ups and downs

He kissed me, he kissed me
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
(In this world of ups and downs, in this world of ups and downs
In this world of ups and downs, in this world of ups and downs)
