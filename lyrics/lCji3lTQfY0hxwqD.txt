Telepathic illusion injected into mass pathology
Lies of all religions of priests
Versions of genesis
And non-existent prophets

A dry silhouette of dead god

Propelled by the
Damaged frontal lobes
The obtuse humans
Roam in somnambulism
Towards the deaf walls
Kneel and pray to nothingness there

As if the dead toll
Of bloodless massacre

Holy charisma as mind control shift
Psychic magnetic field

Endless emanation braindeads
Pierced by
Phalloid obelisks
No one not even there
Saviour had ever been resurrected
Abandoned, disposed, discarded

I order all symbols crumble
I order the consumption of all churches
