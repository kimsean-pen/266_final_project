I remember on summer nights
We run for cover to ignore the daylight
And in the darkness we go on, and on again
In summer rain [?]
Even sweet nothing seems to take us too strong
Still you tell me that I can't see it back again

Not tonight,
All I want to say is I've tried but I can't rewind
Not tonight,
I don't wanna run away, but the longer you play the time
I'm giving in

Every night I'm tryna to warn you
But you're still sleeping in those clothes I bought you
Come on baby, knock it on back again

Not tonight,
All I want to say is I've tried but I can't rewind
Not tonight,
I don't wanna run away, but the longer you play the time
I'm giving in

Oh-ooh
Not today
Pause and replay
I'm standing in the way
Let it all play away
Not tonight,
All I want to say is I've tried but I can't rewind
Not tonight,
I don't wanna run away, but we gotta leave those days behind
