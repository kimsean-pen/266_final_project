I don't mind where you're going
The remedy, remedy's the same
I don't mind now you know me
The remedy, remedy's the same

If you're hurt I'm sorry
But that's what I've been through and
I'm lonely
'Cause I need you
I need you
To help me through it
I'm sorry

Here I find
What it takes to be alive
And I'm feeling like I'm high enough
But I'm not quite sure I am feeling up for it

I won't and you hope for the same
You love what I love but you're sane enough
To know I've gotta go
I'm looking at myself, but I don't see him anymore

If you're hurt I'm sorry
But that's what I've been through and,
I'm lonely
'Cause I need you
I need you
To help me through it
I'm sorry

I'll lock the door for you
To help me through
I'll lock the door for you
To help me through

If you're hurt I'm sorry
But that's what I've been through and,
I'm lonely
'Cause I need you
I need you
To help me through it
I'm sorry
