Putting all my power, righteous as a rose
Dynamite the mountain, now I'm walking up the road
Oh, love we made at gun point wasn't love at all
The dancing in the valley, and the moon's the mirror ball

Blew open my mind, now it's an empty room
Swinging in the hammock, dogs are walking 'cross the roof
I watch you braid your hair, you're from another time
When the earth wasn't so angry, and God was on our side

Searching West and East
And all points in between
Underneath the lines of thought
You're there and then you're not

The Mayans stole tomorrow, hid it underground
We've combed with heavy magnets, but it still hasn't been found
Oh, sweating out my secrets in the Temazcal
They're screaming in the calle that a star's about to fall

Looking through the trees
Cities and the seas
Things we've seen
Ovnis on the lawn
They're there and then they're gone

They're there and then they're gone
They're there and then they're gone
They're there and then they're gone
They're there and then they're gone
They're there and then they're gone
They're there and then they're gone
They're there and then they're gone

Searching west and east
And all points in between
And underneath the hand of god
You're there and then you're not

You're there and then you're not
