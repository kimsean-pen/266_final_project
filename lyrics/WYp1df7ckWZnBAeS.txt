This is how I show my love
I made it in my mind because
I blame it on my ADD baby
Oh, Baby!
This is how an angel cries
I blame it on my sick pride
Blame it on my ADD baby
Oh, Baby!
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Maybe I should cry for help
Maybe I should kill myself
Blame it on my ADD baby
Oh, Baby!
Maybe I'm a different breed
Maybe I'm not listening
So blame it on my ADD baby
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
La la la la la, la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la, la la la la la
La la la la, la, la la la la
La la la la la, la, la la la la la

Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Sail with me into the dark
Sail with me into the dark
Sail with me into the dark
Sail with me into the dark
