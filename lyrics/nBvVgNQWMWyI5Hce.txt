La la la la la la...
Well she said I know but I just can't tell
Everything that you've just been saying
Lucy was there aswell in the dark

When the kids in the band were playing
No-one can hear a word I tell
What the girl was singing
See she must've been 16 or 18

I'm just past caring
She was into the Stones when
I was into the Roses
She was breaking my bones when
I was busting their noses
She would tell me a secret
I would lose it the next day
You're not pleased that you're easy

Makes you sick in a bad way
And all the while the girls sang
La la la la and she sang
Kickings for my sweetheart
Bruises that I just don't miss

And she said "I can't love you anymore than this!"
La la la la la la la...
La la la la la la la...
Aww she said she said oh no no no no
Let me yes why don't you kill me
I said "Wait a minute, stop right there

Sweetheart you know that don't thrill me"
Said I would've been there if only I had been a little bit nicer
I was dead by Sunday half dead scared just trying to please her
She was getting the pills when
I was into her best friend
She was chasing the thrills
And living down at the West End
She was pretty in braces

I lived out of her window
She said "take me to London"
Tell me something I don't know
And all the while the girls sang
La la la la she sang

Kickings for my sweetheart
Bruises that I just don't miss
And she said "I can't love you anymore than this!"
La la la la la...
La la la la la...
La la la la la...
La la la la la...
She was into the Stones when

I was into the Roses
She was breaking my bones when
I was busting their noses
She would tell me a secret

I would lose it the next day
You're not pleased that you're easy
Makes you sick in a bad way
And all the while the girls sang
La la la la she sang
Kickings for my sweetheart
Bruises that I just don't miss
And she said "I don't like you
You can't stand me
I can't love you anymore than this"
