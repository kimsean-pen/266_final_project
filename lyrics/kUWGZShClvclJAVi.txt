Behold this man on the road
The burden that he holds
He lost it all but still he carries on
The sead are left behind
On the road of pain and grief
Promises have been broken
Once again he's been deceived

Homeless man he is
A wanderer without a hope
why this heavy burden
what does he seek
Homeless man he is
Searching for his dreams
Why this heavy burden
Lost all his beliefs

The Spirit Roams

Behold today the face of this man
He smiles now as he knows
His burden starts to slowly fade away
He laughs at himself
Now it's easy to let go, of futile and the needless
To let it lie, to let it go
