There's a cult, there's a cult inside of me
Form the salt, sprinkle it around me
There's a cult, there's a cult inside of me
Form the salt, sprinkle it around me

Sleep is a welcome gadget in our headbondhood
The crawling animals will seek
All things warm, all things moist
And I will relentlessly shame myself
In rest, in wake, in front of
My truly born beloved
For here I lie in wait
Hush little heart

Steal my sweating lips
Wield my starving hips
There's a cult, there's a cult inside of me
Form the salt, sprinkle it around me

Into a bright, bound sea surrounded fury
Our bodies will return
Into a bright, bound sea surrounded fury
Our bodies will return
Into a bright, bound sea surrounded fury
Our bodies will return

The creepers blood is seeping
From this undead, wooden headboard
Varnish my forehead red in evenings
Drip down over my jowls
Bid them writhe and sprout their
Heavy feathers lift my drooping head

There's a cult, there's a cult inside of me
Form the salt, sprinkle it around me

Into a bright, bound sea surrounded fury
Our bodies will return
Into a bright, bound sea surrounded fury
Our bodies will return
Into a bright, bound sea surrounded fury
Our bodies will return

There's a cult, there's a cult inside of me
Form the salt, sprinkle it around me
There's a cult, there's a cult inside of me
Form the salt, sprinkle it around me
