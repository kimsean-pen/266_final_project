I was walking along in the sun
Taking pictures of everyone
And there's something on the tip of my tongue
Oh oh oh oh
Well it's easy to see from the far
And it's easy to be on your guard
But it's harder just to be who you are
Oh oh oh oh

When all these people who will lead you down
The back of the track
They're on your back
They will try and tear you apart
But believe and you will see
That there's no reason to doubt
Then you will find
You can do much better than that

If you think of all the things that you feel
All the voices in your head that you hear
It's a mystery that we are all still holding on

When all these people who will lead you down
The back of the track
They're on your back
They will try and tear you apart
But believe and you will see
That there's no reason to doubt
Then you will find
You can do much better than that

If you see me hit the ground
Don't come near, don't make a sound

I was walking along in the sun
Taking pictures of everyone
And there's something on the tip of my tongue
