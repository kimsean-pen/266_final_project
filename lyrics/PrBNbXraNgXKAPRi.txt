Let's put a new coat of paint on this lonesome old town
Set 'em up, we'll be knockin' em down
You wear a dress, baby, I'll wear a tie
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon in that burgundy sky

All our scribbled love dreams, lost or thrown away
Here amidst the shuffle of an overflowin' day
Our love needs a transfusion, so let's shoot it full of wine
Fishin' for a good time starts with throwin' in your line

So, let's put a new coat of paint, on this lonesome old town
Set 'em up, set 'em up, we'll be knockin' em down
You wear a dress, baby, I'll wear a tie
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon in that burgundy sky
