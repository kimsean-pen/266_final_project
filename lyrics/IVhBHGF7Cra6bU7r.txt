You could say this was an independent love song
It's nothing like two lovers
What love meant to them
But that's not to say the love we had
Isn't big or that strong
I'm doing it a different way
I'm doing it a different way

You might say this is another boring love song
To be together and forever be true
And so today is much the same as it was then
I'm doing it a different way
I'm doing it a different way

I'll show you how to take me
Go down, go down, go down
And I'll show you how to love me
Right on, right on, right on
And I'll show you how to touch me
Right on, right on, right on

Now I find that many men will look my way
And I'll take them and let them show me the way
And sure I like a few but I leave the rest to play
I'm doing it a different way
I'm doing it a different way

I'm gonna show you how to take me
Go down, go down, go down
And I'll show you how to love me
Right on, right on, right on
And I'll show you how to touch me
Right on, right on, right on
Right on, right on, right on

In a different way, in a different way, in a different way
In a different way, in a different way, in a different way
In a different way, in a different way, in a different way

I'll show you how to take me
Go down, go down, go down
And I'll show you how to love me
Right on, right on, right on
And I'll show you how to touch me
Right on, right on, right on
Right on, right on, right on

You could say this was an independent love song
It's nothing like two lovers
What love meant to them
But that's not to say the love we have
Isn't good or that strong
I'm doing it a different way
I'm doing it a different way
