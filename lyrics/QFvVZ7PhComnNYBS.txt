You must treat your lover girl right
If you wanna make lover's rock
You must know a place you can kiss
To make lover's rock

Everybody knows it's a crying shame
But nobody knows the poor baby's name
When she forgot that thing that she had
Yeah to swallow

Oh you Western man, you're free with your seed
When you make lover's rock
But woops, there goes the strength that you need
To make real cool lover's rock

A genuine lover takes off his clothes
And he can make a lover in a thousand go's
An' she don't need that thing that she had
Yeah to swallow, know what I mean? Oh
Yeah

Yeah, you must treat your lover girl right
To make lover's rock
You must know a place you can kiss
To make lover's rock

Everybody knows it's a crying shame
But nobody knows the poor baby's name
When she forgot that thing that she had
Oh to swallow, hey

Whose rock? They call it 'Lover's rock'
Whose rock? They call it 'Lover's rock'
Whose rock? They call it 'Lover's rock'
