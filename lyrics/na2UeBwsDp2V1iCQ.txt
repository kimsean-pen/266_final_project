You gotta keep on, keep on pushing.
I don't know, if I can do,
the things our friends, are going through.
They're talking kids, and mortgages,
send save the dates.

Can't do the meal with your mum and your dad,
see it out 'til it all turns bad.
What you want is not a boy, need a man.
I can't be that man.

You keep on,
Girl, you're pushing,
you're pushing all the way,
'til you got no more, 'til you got no more...
Girl, you're pushing,
I wish I felt the same,
But I got no more, I got no more...

You gotta keep on, keep on pushing.
I'm gonna leave for, leave for sure.
I got no more.

Cash in the bank for a house,
couple years and it all pans out.
You want a future and you want it now.
I want not right now,

Can't do the meal with your mum and your dad,
see it out 'til it all turns bad.
What you want is not a boy, need a man.
I can't be that man.

You gotta keep on, keep on pushing.
I'm gonna leave for, leave for sure.
Keep on, keep on pushing.
I'm gonna leave for, leave for sure.
I got no more.

Girl, you're pushing,
you're pushing all the way,
'til you got no more, 'til you got no more...

Girl, you're wishing,
Wish I felt the same, but I got no more,
I got no more.

You gotta keep on, keep on pushing.
I'm gonna leave for, leave for sure.
Keep on, keep on pushing.
I'm gonna leave for, leave for sure.
I got no more.

You gotta keep on, keep on pushing.
(Keep on pushing)
I'm gonna leave for, leave for sure.
Keep on, keep on pushing.
(Keep on pushing)
I'm gonna leave for, leave for sure.
I got no more.
