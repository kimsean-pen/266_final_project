Through the haze you see a shimmering light
A golden pyramid erected right in your sight
You reach out your hands to the gods so old
You wanna take but you can't give
Cause all you had you sold

You wanna touch the light
So close to reach, still out of sight
The gods must know that you got no soul
Cause all you gather is dust, no pyramid of gold

Come purple pyramid, come purple pyramid!

No moon to guide you home tonight
No white horse will lead you home

You set out for a pyramid of gold
And you believed the earth you walk is holy
See your stars falling from the sky now
And rising a purple pyramid of sorrow

Come purple pyramid, come purple pyramid!

No moon to guide you home tonight
No white horse will lead you home

Dark cloud comes
Blocking your sun
Race is run
All your dreams have come undone
Dark cloud comes
Blocking your sun
Race is run
All your dreams undone

You set out for a pyramid of gold
And you believed the earth you walk is holy
See your stars falling from the sky now
And rising, a purple pyramid of sorrow

Come purple pyramid, come purple pyramid!

No moon to guide you home tonight
No white horse will lead you home
