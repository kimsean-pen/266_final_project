I don't want to go back to that place again
Nothing will ever be the same again
Never even cared if it's fake pretend
Maybe you can show me what it takes to end forever
Emptiness it came again
When its from inside you know you can't defend against it
Writing but I can't press send
Kisses from the raindrops tell me wait again, one last time

Clean, clean, clean, cut the rope let me in
Wings, wings, wings, I grow wings I go in
Scars, scars, scars I got scars on my arms
Fall, fall, fall out of love and apart
Skin, skin, skin let the skin touch the skin
Wind, wind, wind, never was never been
I'm sinking it goes up to my chin
White, white, white grey to black ever since

Clean, clean, clean, cut the rope let me in
Wings, wings, wings, I grow wings I go in
Scars, scars, scars I got scars on my arms
Fall, fall, fall out of love and apart
Skin, skin, skin let the skin touch the skin
Wind, wind, wind, never was never been
I'm sinking it goes up to my chin
White, white, white grey to black ever since
