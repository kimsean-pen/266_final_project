I'm so sorry for calling you at this time
I'm wa-watching this video that reminded me
Of the movies we used to see
The people we used to be
I'm wa-wondering how are your mum and dad
'Cause mi-mine keep on asking whatever happened to

The girl that I used to see
How happy I used to be
Do you ever think of me?

Ever since you le-e-eft
I can't get out of be-e-ed, it's true
What's a heart supposed to do
With a hole the size of you-u-u

I wish I could undo-o-o-o the pain
But my heart can't catch a break
I think about you every single day

I kept all of the pictures you used to draw
I still drink from the cup you stole from the bar and I
I swear I can taste your lips
Every morning with every sip
I ho-hope you don't see me when I go out
I don't think you'd approve of who I am right now

I'm not who I used to be
That's the truth baby truthfully
Do you ever think of me

Ever since you le-e-eft
I can't get out of be-e-ed, it's true
What's a heart supposed to do
With a hole the size of you-u-u

I wish I could undo-o-o-o the pain
But my heart can't catch a break
I think about you every single day

I get in my car and drive through the dark
I speed past the exit that leads to your house
And wonder what you're doing now
Are you thinking 'bout me

What's a heart supposed to do
With a hole the size of you-u-u
I wish I could undo-o-o-o the pain
But my heart can't catch a break
I think about you every single day
