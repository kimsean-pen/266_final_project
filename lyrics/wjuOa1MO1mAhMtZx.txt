I didn't hear you leave
I wonder how am I still here
I don't want to move a thing
It might change my memory

Oh, I am what I am
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide

I won't go, I won't sleep, I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me
I won't leave, I can't hide, I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me

I don't wanna call my friends
They might wake me from this dream
And I don't want to leave this bed
Risk forgetting all that it's been

Oh, I am what I am
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide

I won't go, I won't sleep, I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me
I won't leave, I can't hide, I cannot be
Until you're resting here

I won't go, I won't sleep, I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me
I won't leave, I can't hide, I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me

Oh, I am what I am
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide

I won't go, I won't sleep, I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me
I won't leave, I can't hide, I cannot be
Until you're resting here

I won't go, I won't sleep, I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me
I won't leave, I can't hide, I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me
