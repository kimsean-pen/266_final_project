This is your wake up call
Your chance to change it all
No hope that you change it

You hear alarm bells sound
It's time to turn it round

I'm trying to save you

You say that it's all you got
When you know it's not
Your fingers are crossed
4 leaf clover for luck if
Hard work pays off
I guess that you're broke

Woah oh, you know, you gotta work for it
Woah oh, you know, you gotta work for it

I don't mean to offend
I say this as a friend
Something is missing
I want to make this clear
Something you need to hear
Why won't you listen?

Woah oh, you know, you gotta work for it
Woah oh, you know, you gotta work for it
Woah oh, you know, you gotta work for it
Woah oh, you know, you gotta work for it
Work for it

You say that it's all you got
When you know it's not
Your fingers are crossed
4 leaf clover for luck if
Hard work pays off
I guess that you're broke

You say that you gave it a shot
But your goal wasn't cut
The door has shut
Got no keys to unlock 'cause
You get what you give
And you ain't got shit

Woah oh, you know, you gotta work for it
Woah oh, you know, you gotta work for it
Woah oh, you know, you gotta work for it
Woah oh, you know, you gotta work for it
Work for it
