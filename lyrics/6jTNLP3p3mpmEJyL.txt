Hiding underneath
The veil of broken dreams we find her weeping
On her once white wings
She will be carrying the weight of our deeds

And she bleeds for love forever gone

Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie
Killing ourselves, a kiss at a time
The devils dance while angels smile
Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie

Finding souls to feed
The nightside of Eden
We see her struggling
For her love's last breath And walk off

Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie
Killing ourselves, a kiss at a time
The devils dance while angels smile
Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie

She's blinded by the fear
Of life and death and everything in between
We smile when she cries a river of tears
A mirror where we see nothing but a reflection of heaven too far away

Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie
Killing ourselves, a kiss at a time
Devils dance while angels smile
Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie

We're so alive
(Drunk on shadows)
So alive
(Drunk on shadows)
So alive
(Drunk on shadows)
(Drunk on shadows)
So alive
(Drunk on shadows)
I'm drunk on shadows
