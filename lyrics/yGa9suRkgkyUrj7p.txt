Are you feeling alive?

Are you feeling alive?
Are you feeling alive?

Are you feeling alive?

Pace, pace yourself before you run straight into yourself.
Pace, pace yourself before you run straight into.

You sleep in fragmented glass
With reflections of you,
But are you feeling alive?
Yeah let me ask you,
Are you feeling alive?

I hope the dead brings the dead
And they march across our beds.
I've done it before
I hope the dead brings the dead
And they march across our beds.
I've done it before
I've done it before

I rode the horse of death, of death.
Ride the horse of death!
So ride the horse of death!
Ride the horse of death!
Ride the horse of death!
Ride the horse of death!
Ride the horse of death!
Ride the horse of death!

I hope the dead brings the dead
And they march across our beds.
I've done it before
I hope the dead brings the dead
And they march across our beds.
I've done it before
I've done it before

But let me ask you,
Are you feeling alive?

Are you feeling alive?

If the light doesn't come outside.
If the light doesn't come outside.
If the light doesn't come outside.
If the light doesn't come outside.
