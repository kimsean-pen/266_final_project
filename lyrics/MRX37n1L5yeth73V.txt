What are we all living for?
If nothing's worth dying for tonight
Your dreams are not enough
What I need is love
That's worth laying down my life

Sing along,
Just like they taught us
It's soothing your mind this lullaby
No heaven above us
Just mile after mile of empty sky

No right or wrong
Can you imagine?
A world where there's no more need to cry
But no joy or passion
Its seems that the price is much to high
But I am holding out for something real

And though you offered peace
What I really need comes to so much more
Your dreams are not enough
What I need is love that's worth dying for

You say that you're a dreamer
Well I'm a dreamer too
But I wont sing your lullaby
However well intentioned
Its neither good nor true
The pallid dream is just a lie

But I am holding out for something real

And though you offered peace
What I really need comes to so much more
Your dreams are not enough
What I need is love that's worth dying for

What are we all living for
If nothing's worth dying for tonight?
