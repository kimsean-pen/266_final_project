Is it war if you fight it?
Is it love when you don't?
There is more when you let go
Of the fear that you can't

As we burn in the fire
Slowly learning to breathe
Just keep calm in the falling
Always looking for an underneath

Imagine it's a warning sign
I don't wanna lose more time
Darling, don't you close your eyes
Keep listening - are you listening?
I'm sorry we don't have forever
Ooh... but come die with me

There's a knock in the silence
I see death at the door
But I know we'll be alright
Cause your hands are still warm

The day the smoke starts rising
And all the bombs fall down
Don't wanna be the ones caught hiding
Wanna see the sky when it hits the ground

Imagine it's a warning sign
I don't wanna lose more time
Darling, don't you close your eyes
Keep listening - are you listening?
I'm sorry we don't have forever
Ooh... but come die with me
