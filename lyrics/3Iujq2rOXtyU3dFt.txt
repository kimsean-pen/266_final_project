If you get tired of just hangin' around
Pick up a guitar and spin a web of sound
And then you could be strung out all day
With your lovers and clowns
But now I find myself hanging around

It's been a long war and I'm tired and dirty
Still not dirty enough for you, my love

I've been thieving, I stole the light from the dawn
But when I come round on this ledge, I wish I'd never been born
Aw, tell me you can see me, or can't you see through it all?
I'm empty, lost, alone, won't you heed my call?

It's been a long war, now we're tired and dirty
Still not dirty enough for you, oh

Aw, I'm so tired of hangin' around
I'll pick up a guitar and spin a web of sound
Spin, my love

So tired of hangin' around
Just hangin' around
Just hangin' around
