Brian Wilson 1960 and vine
Summer kisses
In a pendleton shirt
Songs and gentle words
Granted wishes

When I look in your eyes I go soft inside
And the sound of your voice sends
Shivers up my spine
And at the slightest touch we're in love
You and me and the moon

In a cool gay bar where the people are entertaining
When the sun pops in we'll still be talking and champagning

Underneath the strobe light
We'll dance all night
I'm a little bit shy, you're easy on the eye
And at the slightest touch we're in love
You and me and the moon

When you look in my eyes I go soft inside
And the sound of your voice sends
Shivers up my spine
And at the slightest touch we're in love
You and me and the moon
