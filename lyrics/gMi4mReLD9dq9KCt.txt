Life is just a lonely highway
I'm out here on the open road
I'm old enough to see behind me
But young enough to feel my soul
I don't wanna lose you, baby
And I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna live my days without you
But for now I've got to be without you

I've got a pocket full of money
And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds
But then I think of loving
And I just can't get you off of my mind, yeah

Baby, can't you see
That this is killing me
I don't want to push you, baby
And I don't want you to be told
It's just that I can't breathe without
Feel like I'm gonna lose control

I've got a pocket full of money
And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds
But when it comes to loving
I just can't get you off of my mind, yeah

Am I a fool to think that there's a little hope, yeah
Tell me baby, yeah
What are the rules the reasons and the do's and dont's, yeah
Tell me baby, tell me baby, yeah
What do you feel inside?

I've got a pocket full of money
And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds, oh yeah
But when it comes down to loving
I just can't get you off of my mind, yeah
I just can't get you off of my mind, yeah
