Soon as he was agreed
The real business
All this I ever spent
A meaner rhythm

Fantasy greenery
All in all an enemy
(Or early morning millionaire
As everyone seems to put down)
Enemy, synergy
Intermixed with legacies

Better days
Better quakes

Oomingmak, Omingmak
Drifting on forever on a side wall

Fantasy greenery
All in all an enemy
Nervousness, anarchist
Clearly spoke, clearly wrote

Feet like fins

A time to live again
A little tense
Beyond belief
I grew up setting blocks
