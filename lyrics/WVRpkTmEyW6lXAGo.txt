I don't owe anything
I don't owe anyone
Shoot pride for all it's worth
I don't belong

I don't owe anyone
I don't owe anyone

In a situation now
That I could not repair
I assert myself to sleep
Show others that I've cared
How cold is this poor life
Lay ashes at my grave

If it takes me away from you
A subtle gesture

I don't know anyone (cherish my religion)
I don't know anyone (faith is only fiction)
I don't know anyone (cherish my religion)
I don't know anyone (faith is only fiction)

This is erased I promise not a trace
This is erased I promise not a trace no delay
This is erased I promise not a trace
This is erased I promise not a trace no delay

I don't know anyone (cherish my religion)
I don't know anyone (faith is only fiction)
I don't know anyone (cherish my religion)
I don't know anyone (faith is only fiction)
