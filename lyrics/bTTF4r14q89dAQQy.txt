You know my scheme,
I saw your gleam
Nobody's found so tainted like you.
Get in my car,
I'll take you far
Just hold me tight cuz I'm flawed just like you.

Let's go

You pull on me,
Like one two three
Nobody's found so tainted like you.
It's no way back,
I like this track
Just hold me tight cuz I'm flawed just like you.

And if you push it in once,
And if you push it in twice,
And if you push it in nice,
I'm gonna hit paradise.

And if you push it in once,
And if you push it in twice,
And if you push it in nice,
You're gonna hit paradise.

Like silver ball,
I'd love to roll
Nobody's found so tainted like you.
Don't give a fly,
Bout yo last night
Just hold me tight cuz I'm flawed just like you.

And if you push it in once,
And if you push it in twice,
And if you push it in nice,
I'm gonna hit paradise.

And if you push it in once,
And if you push it in twice,
And if you push it in nice,
You're gonna hit paradise.

My bass is like boom boom,
It's crazy here don't disappear.
And don't be so glum glum,
Just try to catch my atmosphere.
My diamonds in the sky sky,
I like it when you do it nice.
Let's go and get so high high,
That's what I call my paradise.

You do it, and I feel the lead is like flowing inside my body.
I am like edgy string,
And I breathing deeply.
The temperature in my veins become thousands times higher.
Finally, it's all blown up,
And I come.

And if you push it in once,
And if you push it in twice,
And if you push it in nice,
I'm gonna hit paradise.

And if you push it in once,
And if you push it in twice,
And if you push it in nice,
You're gonna hit paradise.
