I never thought I'd grow up so fast so far
And to know yourself is to let yourself be loved
And I want to be addicted, I want to be secure
I want to wake up after the night before

But do you ever get me?
Do you ever get me? Hey
Do you ever get me? Yeah, yeah

And I'll press your hand against my face
Weaken my resistance
And I'll pull the sheets over our heads

Let the broken sky break above our heads
And I want to be addicted, I want to be secure
I want to wake up after the night before

But do you get me?
Do you ever get me? Hey
Do you ever get me? Yeah

Shower me with affection and I'll return in kind
I have no hidden motive, I am blind
I'm a stone inside a box, I'm a spring inside a clock
You can wear me on your wrist
And I'll tell you things ten thousand times

But do you ever get me? Yeah
Do you ever get me? Yeah, yeah
Do you ever get me? Hey

Do you ever get me? Yeah, yeah
Do you ever get me? Oh, yeah
Do you ever get me?
