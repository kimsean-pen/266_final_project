Look at the moon
Look after you
Look at all the things you didn't do
It's easy to believe disaster trends

Look at the stars
Look at the cars
Look at the things you pretend are yours
While we choke the sleep that you discuss

I'm still trying
Trying
Trying to perceive that this is right
And I'm crashing
Crashing
Crashing on the prison by design

Look at the clues
Look at the bruise
Look at all the things that you do lose
I don't think this girl could crack a smile

Eat up the hearts
Release the charts
Do what you think is why or who you are
Estimate the darker gun tonight (?)

Oh
Oh it amounts
Dream of the sea
(?)
My war is not better
Not better as the rest that you will find

Look at the men
Look at your friend
Look at the one you want to never end
Hostage like they're feeding me the dimes

Look at the door
Look at your phone
Look at the face that you want some more
Beaten down by the lonely pride

It's not me, it's not you
Not that, not this time
It's not me, it's not you
Not that, not this time

Oh
The winter nights
Love to dream
To a rather land (?)

Oh
The winter nights
Dream of the sea
To a rather land (?)

It's not me, it's not you
Not that not this time
