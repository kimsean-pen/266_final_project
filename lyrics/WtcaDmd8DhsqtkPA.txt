From this view, I see color
The blacks and the blues
Here comes another night
Without you, looking over the trees and the roofs
And I don't know what I would find

I don't know if you're even in the city
Don't know if you're even at home
Don't know who you spending all your time with

But do you miss me at all?
Do you wonder what I'm up to without you?
Do you miss me at all?
Do you wanna leave a message on my phone saying, "I'm coming home"?

In this room, you're the wallpaper
That sticks like glue into my memory
So do you think me over once in a blue moon?
'Cause you always rise to me

I don't know if you're even in the city
Don't know if you're even at home
Don't know who you spending all your time with

But do you miss me at all?
Do you wonder what I'm up to without you?
Do you miss me at all?
Do you wanna leave a message on my phone saying, "I'm coming home"?

Gone without a trace
You been so MIA
Was passing through your neighborhood
Boy, you've been abrupt
I never get enough
To know that you still think of me too

And I don't know if you're even in the city
Don't know if you're even at home
Don't know who you spending all your time with

But do you miss me at all?
Do you wonder what I'm up to without you?
Do you miss me at all?
Do you wanna leave a message on my phone saying, "I'm coming home"?

Yeah
Do you wonder what I'm up to without you?
Do you miss me at all?
Do you wanna leave a message on my phone saying, "I'm coming home"?

Yeah
Do you wonder what I'm up to without you?
Do you miss me at all?
Do you wanna leave a message on my phone saying, "I'm coming home"?
