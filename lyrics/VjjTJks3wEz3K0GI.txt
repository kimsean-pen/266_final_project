She doesn't wanna have to move to Xanadu
She doesn't wanna lay in bed all day with you
She'll do anything you tell her not to do
She's gonna paint your white picket fence all black and blue
She won't drive into the Grand Canyon with you
She already knows you went and got her name tattooed
She's a lipstick anarchist

She doesn't wanna bake a birthday cake for you
She doesn't wanna watch Twin Peaks again with you
She already saw the director's cut on Pay Per View
She's a lipstick anarchist
