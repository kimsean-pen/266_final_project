Really couldn't say that I know your type
Yeah
30,000 feet and I'm so damn high
Ohh

Are you excited? Do you like it?
And if you hold me, I won't mind it
And I don't know you but I want to
And if this plane fell to the water I'm OK

We'll ride the waves of the ocean
Wasting all of our days
We could roll with the motion
It could all float away
All these feels in the open
Reasons I've been afraid
Knowing I won't drown if I keep my head afloat
I'ma keep my head afloat

Keep my head afloat, keep my head afloat
Head afloat
Keep my head afloat, keep my head afloat
Head afloat
Keep my head afloat, keep my head afloat
Head afloat
Keep my head afloat, keep my head afloat

The sun won't shine if you're terrified
Yeah
It's all the same when you close your eyes
Ohh

Are you excited? Do you like it?
And if you hold me, I won't mind it
And I don't know you but I want to
And if this plane fell to the water I'm OK

We'll ride the waves of the ocean
Wasting all of our days
We could roll with the motion
It could all float away
All these feels in the open
Reasons I've been afraid
Knowing I won't drown if I keep my head afloat
I'ma keep my head afloat

Keep my head afloat, keep my head afloat
Head afloat
Keep my head afloat, keep my head afloat
Head afloat
Keep my head afloat, keep my head afloat
Head afloat
Keep my head afloat, keep my head afloat

Keep my head afloat
Head afloat
Keep my head afloat, keep my head afloat
Head afloat
Keep my head afloat, keep my head afloat
Head afloat
Keep my head afloat, keep my head afloat
Head afloat
Keep my head afloat, keep my head afloat
