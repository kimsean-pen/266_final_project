eyes will drain into the skull
Just pull the plug on things you want no one to know
Secrets within secrets

Although consequences haven't stopped the violent faces occupying metastasis
Secrets within secrets within secrets within secrets

Locked box hidden inside these walls

But they know your blindside
So polite, thank them for your rebirth

Your birth
Your rebirth

Stay down cause you can not get up from above
Stay down cause you lost all the things that you love
Stay down cause its secrets within secrets within secrets within secrets within secrets

Locked box hidden inside these walls

Your blindside compassion won't save you from us

Take this day and take apart the insides of your hope
Take this day and realize
It's all lies
Frozen on your lips

Allow yourself this retreat after your rebirth
