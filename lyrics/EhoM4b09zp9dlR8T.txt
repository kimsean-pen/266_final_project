When she's on her best behaviour
Don't be tempted by her favours
Never turn your back on Mother Earth

Towns are hurled from A to B
By arms that looked so smooth to me
Never turn your back on Mother Earth

Never turn your back on Mother Earth

Three days and two nights away from my friends
Amen to anything that brings a quick return to my friends
To my friends

Never turn your back on Mother Earth

Well, I'll admit I was unfaithful
But from now I'll be more faithful
Never turn your back on Mother
Never turn your back on Mother
Never turn your back on Mother Earth
