I'm the reason this got started
Devil's work dearly departed
You'll never catch me in the light
I'm why you lock your doors at night
Call me evil
Call me satan
I'm in the shadow of Salvation
Just close your eyes and count to ten
Play nice, you'll never see me again

One last time
Would you open the door
Step into the light
And show us your face
One last time
Would you open the door
Step into the light

You'll be silent forever
Always clutching your heart
You'll be silent forever
I'll be gone, gone in the dark

Everyone knows the situation
You never go to a second location
Somebody should have warned you
Now through clenched teeth and sullied pride
I'll ask you nicely get inside
Don't make a sound
Don't see my face
Hell is only a mile away

One last time
Would you open the door
Step into the light
And show us your face
One last time
Would you open the door
Step into the light

You'll be silent forever
Always clutching your heart
You'll be silent forever
I'll be gone, gone in the dark

When my work is done
And they give me a name
I'll step in the light and show my face

They call me white bat
I kinda like that
They call me white bat
Next time i breathe
They call me (white bat)
I am the white bat
Never forget that
I am the white bat
Never forget
