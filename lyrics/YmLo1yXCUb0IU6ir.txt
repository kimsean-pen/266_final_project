Come on babe, ooh, ooh
Don't make me sleep on the couch, no, no, no
Love Jones is on the TV again, baby
Ooh, I wanna go down south, yeah

Come on baby
Come on baby
Its so undignified to sleep alone
Oh yes it is

That's what all the people
Ain't got nobody do
You know they do
Talkin', talkin' on the telephone

Don't make me crash
Don't you do it baby, don't you do it, uh uh
Don't make me sleep without your kiss
Oh darlin' without your kiss
Don't u make me do it
Tossin' and a turnin', every inch of me yearnin'

Don't you make me, don't you make me
Don't you make me, don't you make me
Don't you make me, don't you make me
Don't you make me, don't you make me
Suffer for this

I know, I know, I know, I know
We agreed to be married
You know, I know
Shouldn'ta let me unzip your dress
Why'd you do it, baby, why'd you do it?
Oh yeah

Confess you tease
Unless you please me
Don't make me
Don't make me sleep on the couch
