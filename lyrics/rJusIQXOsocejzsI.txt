Blue moon
(Blue, blue, blue, blue moon)
You saw me standing alone
(Blue, blue, blue, blue moon)

Without a dream in my heart
(Blue, blue, blue, blue moon)
Without a love of my own

Blue moon
(Blue, blue, blue, blue moon)
You knew just what I was there for
(Blue, blue, blue, blue moon)

You heard me saying a prayer for
(Blue, blue, blue, blue moon)
Someone I really could care for

And then suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms could ever hold
I heard somebody whisper, "Please, adore me"
But when I looked that moon had turned to gold

Blue moon
(Blue, blue, blue, blue moon)
Now, I'm no longer alone
(Blue, blue, blue, blue moon)

Without a dream in my heart
(Blue, blue, blue, blue moon)
Without a love of my own
(Blue, blue, blue, blue moon)
Without a love of my own

Blue moon
