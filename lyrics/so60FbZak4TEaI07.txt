Sixteen years,
without even a place to call my home
But I'll dry my tears,
looking for a place to rest my bones

All these years
But never changed the one that I have known
Despite my fears
I'm sure that I can make it on my own

Party drugs and limousines
Oh Momma this is killing me

I'm half the man I used to be
To give to lust and gambling
Oh Momma I need rescuing
What sixteen years has done to me

Sixteen years
Burning every bridge that I have known
Without you here,
The world has gotten colder on my own
Party drugs and limousines
Oh Momma this is killing me
I'm half the man I used to be
To give to lust and gambling
Oh Momma I need rescuing
What sixteen years has done to me
There's nothing like it

I'm going away
There's nothing like the feeling
Of being alone now on a New York street
Gives everything some meaning
There's nothing like being torn apart
From a love you've known right from the start
There's nothing like this feeling

There's nothing like it, I'm going away
There's nothing like the feeling
Of being alone now on a New York street
Gives everything some meaning
There's nothing like being torn apart
From a love you've known right from the start
There's nothing like this feeling

Party drugs and limousines
Oh Momma this is killing me
I'm half the man I used to be
To give to lust and gambling
Oh Momma I need rescuing
What sixteen years has done to me
It's what sixteen years has done to me
It's what sixteen years has done to me
