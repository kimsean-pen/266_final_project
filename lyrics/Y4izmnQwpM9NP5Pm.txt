Ever after comes after we meet
I think the movies were lying to me
Oh my, how they lie
Know I'm ready to give you my heart
Just gotta find you so we can start
Oh yeah, but till then
I gotta be patient
But I'm tired of waiting

I'm just a hopeless romantic
Looking for love
I'd risk it all just to have it
I wouldn't take it for granted
I'm just a hopeless romantic
Not giving up
Cause I deserve to find my own
I can feel it in my bones
Yes, I know you're somewhere close
Giving me hope

Bet we met at a party before
You were sweet and held open the door
Oh my, I should've said hi
So if you're out there
And hearing this song
Just know I'm here
And you're taking too long
Baby, come and find me
Cause I've been so patient
And I'm sick of waiting

I'm just a hopeless romantic
Looking for love
I'd risk it all just to have it
I wouldn't take it for granted
I'm just a hopeless romantic
Not giving up
Cause I deserve to find my own
I can feel it in my bones
Yes, I know you're somewhere close
Giving me hope, oh yes, you are

Under these stars and under the moon
Searching for me and I'm looking for you
Show me you're out there
Tell me you

You're just a hopeless romantic
And you're looking for love
You'd risk it all just to have it
You wouldn't take it for granted

I'm just a hopeless romantic
Looking for love
I'd risk it all just to have it
I wouldn't take it for granted
I'm just a hopeless romantic
Not giving up
Cause I deserve to find my own
I can feel it in my bones
Yes, I know you're somewhere close
Giving me hope
