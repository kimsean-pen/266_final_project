I'm trying to leave my ocean home
I'm trying to leave my ocean
Though I don't know nothin' of the swamp

And I could be a limbless star
Pushing at the sac all ready to delight the lucid shoal
And you don't look impressed
I could be the dolphin of your dreams

Willing wings to my chest
One day I'll grow up I'll show you
Harpoons and monsoons won't keep me at bay
There's so much left to happen

My limbs, now my fins, now a film on my lips
And why you never call back?
I'm older I'm colder, I'm not comming good
A cherub in the ashtray

Wriggling back to the source
And thrashing up the waterfalls for what?
Somewhere there's a place
And I can be the whale that takes you all

But maybe I'm a lioness
And when I reach the shore I'll
Tear apart hyenas with no thought

Now organs in a glassy globe
And cloudy with potential
Muscle mass and vertebrae begin

Trying to figure my place
And feverish with all my dreams awake
they don't notice me now
But I could be the whale that takes them all

(Them all)

Try this and try this and try this again
I'm never gonna make it
Delete me, repeat me
Let's try this again
A tiny little fish egg, is homeless and boneless and drifting along
Just jelly in the blackness

And inching up to the pole
Only to be lost among the white
Somewhere there is a place
And I could be a pterodactyl god

I'm trying to leave my ocean home
