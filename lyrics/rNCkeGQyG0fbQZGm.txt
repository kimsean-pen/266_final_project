Holding onto air
I'll let you take me where
I'll breathe a little easier
Never standing in one place
The same familiar gait
I know you're a thought
i can't escape
This time
Can you help me rearrange my mind
Can you help me rearrange my night
So you can help me rearrange my mind
It's like I'm standing in one place
The same familiar state
You know I stay hopeless for a while
Let you take me down
So long as I don't feel it
Cause in the end I never mean it

This time
Can you help me rearrange my mind
Can you help me rearrange my night
So you can help me rearrange my mind
All I can say is
All i can say is
All I can say is
You can help me rearrange my night
You can help me rearrange my night
You can help me rearrange my night

This time
Can you help me rearrange my mind
Can you help me rearrange my night
So you can help me rearrange my mind
