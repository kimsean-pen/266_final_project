Here comes Jenny preacher, a-stumbling against the wind
Singing love, love is something to believe in
A prayer and the sea and twenty tons of me
Crying love, love is something to believe in

To my child of wonder rambling
All my crooked fingers pointing blame
Let it all wash out in the rain
Let's let it all wash out in the rain

Beyond the drunken focus of my aim
I'm a hero twisting in the flame
Let's let it all wash out in the rain
Let it all wash out in the rain

One more for forgiveness, all twisting in the cold
Singing love, love is something I believe in
Too much, my defenses are dangling from the chain
Oh but free, free is something to believe in

To my god, I want my gypsy train
To my child, a howlin' tambourine
Let it all wash out in the rain
Let it all wash out in the rain

Let's let it all wash out in the rain
Let it all wash out in the rain
