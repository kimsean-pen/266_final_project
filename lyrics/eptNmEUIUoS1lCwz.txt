I've been romanced and I've been danced
Crazy nights and wild times
Life has lost it's mystery
And love is blind, and cannot find me

'Cause I'm blowin' away
And shadows
Take my love and leave
I'm blowin' away
And shadows
Keep takin' my love and leavin' me

I have cast aside my foolish pride
Goin' down for the very last time
'Cause I have searched this earth
And sailed these seas but love is blind
And cannot find me

I'm blowin' away
And shadows take my love and leave
I'm blowin' away
And shadows
Keep takin' my love and leavin' me

I'm blowin' away
And shadows take my love and leave
I'm blowin' away
And shadows
Keep takin' my love and leavin' me
