this foggy line
this misty morning
this railroad sign
keeps me falling
i sleep outside
even if it's raining
it's a sign
i'm leaving in the morning

i don't wanna talk, you lost me yet again
somebody left all mighty, my god friend
reptile mind, the good thrilled parted game
i don't wanna ask your father or anything

that cancer mind
that old bats carpet
to realise
what i am marking
and some old eyes
that i am watching

i don't wanna talk, you lost me yet again
somebody left all mighty, my god friend
reptile mind, the good thrilled parted game
i don't wanna ask your father or anything

i don't wanna talk, you lost me yet again
somebody left all mighty, my god friend
reptile mind, the good thrilled parted game
i don't wanna ask your father or anything
