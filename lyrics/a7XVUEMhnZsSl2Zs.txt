I was eighteen when we first met
Couldn't believe how you took my breath
In your sweatshirt, your converse
You didn't even know you were rockin' my world

Sittin' in line, tryin' to get a coffee
Stealin' looks, you turned around and caught me
I laughed, and you smiled
And we took a chance to stay for a while

Oh-woah-woah-woah
I never saw you comin'
Oh-woah-woah-woah
But I had to say somethin'

Hello beautiful, I've never seen you before
Do you live 'round here, what's your name beautiful?
The way you looked at me, girl it took my breath away
And I had to introduce myself, I just had to say

Hello beautiful, beautiful, woah-oo-woah
Hello beautiful, beautiful, woah-oo-woah

I got your name, and I got your number
We sat for hours, talkin' to each other
But one night, just wasn't enough
We were all in, fallin' in love

I tried to see you but your daddy wouldn't let me
He told you, you should just forget me
But what we had, was somethin' so real and
He didn't know, the way we feel

Oh-woah-woah-woah
And so I met you in the dark
Oh-woah-woah-woah
Underneath the stars

Hello beautiful, it's good to see you again
I'm glad you found your way down to this riverbend
I know we don't have long, but I'll take what I can get
Every moment spent with you is worth the consequence

Hello beautiful, beautiful, woah-oo-woah
Hello beautiful, beautiful, woah-oo-woah

And I remember when you called me
Something in your voice had changed
You told me you were moving with your dad to another state
I'm still waiting by this riverbend
Yeah I come here everyday

Waiting for that moment when you find your way
Back to me, and I'll say

Hello beautiful
Hello beautiful
