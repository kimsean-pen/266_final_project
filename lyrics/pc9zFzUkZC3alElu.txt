I'm feeling broken inside; I want to ease the pain
I promise never again and again and again
I feel I'm losing my ground
Now I got to move on
I know I got to be strong to be strong to be strong
I can't survive without you
So should I love or hate you

I'll never be good, I'll never be so
Never misunderstood
You'd better never be good
I'll never be good, I'll never be so
Never misunderstood
You'd better never be good
And now I feel it
And now I feel it
I'm getting stronger
You'd better never be good

And now I feel it
And now I feel it
I'm getting stronger
You'd better never be good

And now I feel it
And now I feel it
I'm getting stronger
You'd better never be good

And now I feel it
And now I feel it
I'm getting stronger
You'd better never be good

Listen to me
I've changed things back
You've gotta take it

I want to leave you behind; I want to ease the pain
I promise never again and again and again
Well, you've been dragging me down
I've never stayed there so long
I know I got to be strong to be strong to be strong
I can't survive without you
So should I love or hate you

I'll never be good, I'll never be so
Never misunderstood
You'd better never be good

I'll never be good, I'll never be so
Never misunderstood
You'd better never be good

And now I feel it
And now I feel it
I'm getting stronger
You'd better never be good

And now I feel it
And now I feel it
I'm getting stronger
You'd better never be good

And now I feel it
And now I feel it
I'm getting stronger
And now I feel it
And now I feel it
I'm getting stronger
You'd better never be good.
