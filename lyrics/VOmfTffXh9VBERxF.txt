coming at you baby
its coming at you baby
its coming at you baby
its been so long
coming at you baby
its coming at you baby
its coming at you baby
its been so long
i've been waiting such a long time just trying to get through
and its taking all of my strength to keep my here away from you
it doesnt matter just how long it takes
nothing changes when were apart
its just a little bit longer weve come this far
one step closer to heaven baby means one stop closer to you
there'll be no more living without you baby im counting each minute till im back to you
one step closer to heaven
baby hold on hold on hold on to my lovin
ive been saving every little bit of my love for you
ive been dreaming just to get by
its so exciting, fantasising
it doesnt matter just how long it takes
just know we'll be back together
and this time its forever
one step closer to heaven baby means one stop closer to you
there'll be no more living without you baby im counting each minute till im back to you
one step closer to heaven
baby hold on hold on hold on to my lovin
coming at you baby
its coming at you baby
its coming at you baby
its been so long
coming at you baby
its coming at you baby
its coming at you baby
its been so long
it doesnt matter just how long it takes

its just a little bit longer weve come this far
one step closer to heaven baby means one stop closer to you
there'll be no more living without you baby im counting each minute till im back to you
