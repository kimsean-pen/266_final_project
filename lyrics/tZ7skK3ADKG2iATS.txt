On the day you died
I cut my hair for the funeral
And on memorial day, I started drinking
Because it got kind of hard just sitting there thinking
About mom all alone in that house
And I'm too far away to do our lunch dates
She misses the regimen
She misses the annoyances
The free time is bittersweet
