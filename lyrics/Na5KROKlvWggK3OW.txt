She stands there looking down
Now she don't come around
High on the wire
A beautiful liar
Tesco disco made me run
For those warm cans in the sun
Now you just order the wine
And break out a line

Where did you go sweet Caroline
The girl I used to know
Oh don't you see now
What you're supposed to do
Yeah you got it bad sister
The ghosts got the best of you
And oh don't you notice no one's looking out for you
Yeah you got it bad sister, you do
I'm looking out for you

All the boys you brought back home
They'd go out and we get stoned
Just you and I
Laugh 'til we cry
I miss playing computer games
You'd get pissed and call me names
All them coffee stains
Ingrained in my brain

Where did you go sweet Caroline
The girl I used to know
Oh don't you see now
What you're supposed to do
Yeah you got it bad sister
The ghosts got the best of you
And oh don't you notice no one's looking out for you
Yeah you got it bad sister, you do
I'm looking out for you

I can't follow, I can't follow you down
It's your choice it's your life it's the bed that you lay in tonight
I don't know him I never did
He's drowning your voice he's keeping you here
I'm no good at good at goodbyes
I never was it's time to be leaving because

You don't see now what you're supposed to do
Yeah you got it bad sister
The ghosts got the best of you
And oh don't you notice no one looking out for you
Yeah you got it bad sister you do
I'm looking out for you
Oh you got it bad sister, you do
There's nothing I can do
