Wide strides up the road
Twist and warp as we go
Disappearing with the wind
We're disappearing

My whole life is chains
I won't do those same things
Disappearing with the wind
We're disappearing

We can take our time to find a way
When the wolves are howling
You can always find the words to say
When the wolves are howling

Our light will lead us home
We'll never get lost, we'll never get lost
We can take our time to find a way
When the wolves are howling

Oh oh, oh oh
When the wolves are howling, when the wolves are howling
Oh oh, oh oh
When the wolves are howling, when the wolves are howling

Hot nights on our own
Spin and shake as we go
Disappearing with the wind
We're disappearing

My eyes are to blame
They won't see the same thing
Disappearing with the wind
We're disappearing

We can take our time to find a way
When the wolves are howling
You can always find the words to say
When the wolves are howling

Our light will lead us home
We'll never get lost, we'll never get lost
We can take our time to find a way
When the wolves are howling

We'll never get lost, we'll never get lost
We'll never get lost, we'll never get lost
We'll never get lost, we'll never get lost
We'll never get lost, we'll never get lost

Oh oh, oh oh
When the wolves are howling, when the wolves are howling
Oh oh, oh oh
When the wolves are howling, when the wolves are howling

Oh oh, oh oh
When the wolves are howling, when the wolves are howling
Oh oh, oh oh
When the wolves are howling, when the wolves are howling
