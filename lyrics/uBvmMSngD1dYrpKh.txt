Seeking fortune on these shores
I ridicule your hopes
Parasite in the realm
To be wiped away

You're doomed in that valley
Raised cages of cold
Wait for the next wave
I welcome these empty shores

The plague is here again
No dignity at all
Yes, you have been waste
And they will freeze, the night away

With my turning winds of high
You die a parrot state
I ride the wasteland
Powered by the will to deny

Seeking, fortune on these shores
I ridicule your hopes
Parasites in the realm
To be wiped away

You're doomed in that valley
Raised cages of cold
Wait for the next wave
Welcome, ...(?)... shores

With my brutal winds of night
You die a parrot state
I ride the wasteland
Powered by the will to deny

The will to deny
Yeah
