Built from
Blind faith
Passed down from self
Induced fantasy
Turn a page, to justify
...
Conjuring power it opens wide
On your seventh day
Is that how it's done?
Twisting your eyes to perceive all that you want
...

To assume, from ignorance
Inflicting wounds with your cross-turned dagger
...
Inside crystal mountain

Evil takes its form

...
Inside crystal mountain

Commandments are reborn

...

All the traps are set

To confine
...
All who get in the way
Of the divine
...
In sight and in mind
Of the hypocrite
...

A slave to the curse
Forever confined
(Solo)
...

Shatter, the myth
Don't cut yourself
On your words against dreams
Made of steel
...
Stronger than any faith
...
That inflicts pain and fear
Is that how it's done?
Twisting your eyes to perceive all that you want
...
To assume from ignorance
Inflicting wounds with your cross-turned dagger
...
Inside crystal mountain
Evil takes its form
...
Inside crystal mountain
Commandments are reborn
