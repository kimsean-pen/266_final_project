There is something special
About this time of year
The Christmas feeling's everywhere
I just got home to join you
I've been away too long
But now I'm back to share my love
Friends are reunited
One big family
Filled with love to last throughout the year
Christmas time
Time to share our love
Come enjoy the tidings to the world
Christmas time, the best time of the year
Yes, it's Christmas time
Christmas time
You and me together
Sleigh ride in the park
Loving kiss straight from the heart
Snowflakes falling gently
A smell of chesnuts in the air
And Christmas lights they gleam across the sky
It's Christmas time
Christmas time
Time to share our love
So come enjoy the tidings to the world
Christmas time
The best time of the year
Yes it's Christmas time
Do you remember (do you remember)
Everything felt so nice
When I held you close to me
Do you remember
Those cold Christmas nights
When we saw the world in harmony
Christmas time
Time to share our love
Come enjoy the tidings to the world
Christmas time, the best time of the year (Yes it's Christmas time)
All around the world, for all the boys and girls
Christmas time, it's time to share our love
Come enjoy the tidings to the world
Christmas time, it's time to share our love
Come enjoy the tidings to the world
Christmas time, it's time to share our love
Come enjoy the tidings to the world
Christmas time, it's time to share our love
Come enjoy the tidings to the world
Christmas time, it's time to share our love
Come enjoy the tidings to the world
Christmas time, it's time to share our love
Come enjoy the tidings to the world
Christmas time, it's time to share our love
