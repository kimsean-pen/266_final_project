Here lies a lifeless bride and groom
Till death do us part came far too soon
Buildings burn and people die
All of the time

But I heard that you reap what you sow
So around and around we go
And when you see my face you'll know

You can't save yourself or save your soul
When you meet the man whose life you stole
With withered wings and broken bones
A flight for the fallen, flies the crow
Can't save yourself

These vengeful thoughts trapped underneath
Rage, scorn, misery
Payback for what you took from me
Hope, love, sanity

I heard that you reap what you sew
So here's to believing in ghosts
Now when you see my face you'll know

You can't save yourself or save your soul
When you meet the man whose life you stole
With withered wings and broken bones
A flight for the fallen, flies the crow

No forgiveness, just farewell
A match made in heaven
You sent straight to hell
No forgiveness, no escape
May you rest in pieces
For your grave mistake
For your grave mistake

You can't save yourself or save your soul
When you meet the man who's life you stole
With withered wings and broken bones
A flight for the fallen, flies the crow
You can't save yourself
No you can't save yourself

For your grave mistake
You can't save yourself
