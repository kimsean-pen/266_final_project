Let me tell you a story about' a boy and a girl,
A very different version than you've ever heard.
Ok so I'm lying but all I'm trying to say,
This isn't about the one that got away.

Watch it from your ivory tower,
Paint the sky grey, like a coward.
How long you got?
I can go for hours.
A sweet little tale that ended sour,
My words will ring in your ears.

Take my advice and leave right now.
You can't find a way to sell yourself,
To someone who cares,
To someone desperate.

First came along my friends were dubious,
She cared for the stage, not who she was with.
I brushed it off and hit the road,
Only to hear she's in the other's 'pose'.

It was the end of summer in 2009,
I wasn't really looking but what did I find?
A golden girl with golden hair,
When I was with her everybody stared.
And I couldn't believe my luck had changed.
And I asked so nice but I 'wouldn't stay'

Take my advice and leave right now.
You can't find a way to sell yourself,
To someone who cares,
To someone desperate.

'Beggars can't be choosers',
I wouldn't choose you,
I've got better things to do with my time
I will bear in mind,
What was in their 'side'

She said who do you, she said who do you,
She said who do you, she said who, DO YOU!?
Who, do you? Who do you?
I said who do you, I said who do you.

Who do you, who do you, think you are,
Who do you, who do you, think you are,
Who do you, who do you, think you are,
Who do you, who do you, think, you, are!
