I'm halfway gone
Sleepless, I'm battle-worn
And you're all I want
So bring me the dawn

I need the sun to break, you've woken up my heart
I'm shaking
All my luck could change
Been in the dark for weeks
And I realise, you're all I need
I hope that I'm not too late
I hope I'm not too late

Back of the room
How come my friends already know you
I feel like a kid
To shy to speak up, so I keep it here
Oh, butterflies
You steal my sleep each night

I need the sun to break
You've woken up my heart
I'm shaking
All my luck could change
Been in the dark for weeks and I realise
You're all I need
I hope that I'm not too late

I hope I'm not too late

(Ooh, oh oh, ooh, oh oh, ooh, oh oh)
I need the sun to break
You've woken up my heart
I'm shaking
All my luck could change
I've been in the dark for weeks
And I realise, you're all I need
And I hope that I'm not too late
I hope I'm not too late
Yes, I hope
I'm not too late
(Ooh, oh oh, ooh, oh oh, ooh oh oh)
