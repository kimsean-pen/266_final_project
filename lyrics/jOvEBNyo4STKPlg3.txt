They're building houses now by the road
The old stone church and kids selling coke
The bluest sky I've ever seen
The cemetery filled with burning leaves

I don't want to find
Anyone else to waste my time
I don't want to find
Anyone else to waste my time

A flightless bird though not by choice
On the side of the road with both wings cut off
Another bird found by the lake
It's severed head lying two feet away

I don't want to find
Anyone else to waste my time
I don't want to find
Anyone else to waste my time

Death comes to claim what is loved the most
You know I've loved this world too much

When death comes to claim what I loved the most
You'll know I've loved this world so much
