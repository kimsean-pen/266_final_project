I can't find you IN THE DARK
So far away, where you are
But everything changes when it's time
When I run to the sea till sun shines
I don't know where to start
You hide away then say it's alright
I seem to paint a red wine
When you want it, I'll be on the other side

I can't see you IN THE DARK
It don't matter where you are
I can't see you IN THE DARK

I can see you fall apart,
You turn away and fade out of sight
But I hear you called in the night
Let it go, let me hold you this time!
(Don't say a word)
Lying in the halls of your heart
I see you lying awake in your ride
I'll be a spark in the sky,
When you want it, I'll be on the other side

I can't see you IN THE DARK
It don't matter where you are
I can't see you IN THE DARK

Inside your head, you are dead
Inside your head, you are dead
I'm trying to believe it
Trying to believe it, trying to believe it
Trying to believe it
Hush, don't say a word!

Running, running, running, running away
Running, running, running, running away
Running, running, running, running away
Running, running, running, running away

I can't see you IN THE DARK
It don't matter where you are
I can't see you IN THE DARK

Get me out when I'm out of time
Knock you down when are you might as wrong
Track so high, just see you in the dark
Trying to see you in the dark
Trying to see you in the dark
Trying to see you in the dark
