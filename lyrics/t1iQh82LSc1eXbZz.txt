Ever feel kinda down and out, you don't know just what to do
Livin' all of your days in darkness let the sun shine through
Ever feel that somehow, somewhere you've lost your way
And if you don't get help quick you won't make it through the day
Could you call on Lady Day, could you call on John Coltrane
Now 'cause they'll, they'll wash your troubles, your troubles, your troubles away

Plastic people with plastic minds are on their way to plastic homes
No beginning there ain't no ending just on and on and on and on and on, it's
All because they're so afraid to say that they're alone
Until our hero rides in, rides in on his saxophone
Could you call on Lady Day, could you call on John Coltrane
Now 'cause they'll, they'll wash your troubles, your troubles,
your troubles away
