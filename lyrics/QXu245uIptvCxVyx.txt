You love to walk, it's a matter of fact
I love your feet, that's the love that I'm at
There's an explosion of feelings inside,
Don't know what you're stumbling over tonight

You are a star at the end of the road
Take a break in your morning robe
Take a listen to the sound of your feet
Take a listen to your heartbeat!

Tell us now what you gonna do
We are leaving it up to you
It's not a problem, it's not a problem, it's not a problem!

All the movements of an outside world
People moving in an inside world
All the movements of the outside world
Keeps on moving in the inside world
Keep on moving in the inside world

Just close your eyes and you'll get what you need
No need to fight, no need to compete
Stay in tune, stay in shape, stay in bed
Stay out of trouble like your mama said.

All the movements of an outside world
People moving in an inside world
All the movements of the outside world
Keeps on moving in the inside world
Keep on moving in the inside world

Tell us now what you gonna do,
We are leaving it up to you
It's not a problem, it's not a problem, it's not a problem!

All the movements of an outside world
People moving in an inside world
All the movements of the outside world
Keeps on moving in the inside world
Keep on moving in the inside world
