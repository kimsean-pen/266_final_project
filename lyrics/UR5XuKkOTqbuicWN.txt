Sing for your tears
a song of the hatred
No one can hear
'cause your life is forgotten
I want to give my life to you
but my will is tied with puppet strings
I am fighting and screaming alone
inside this empty room

They let you down, threw you in the rain
They let you down, sent you away

The night is dark when you're alone
and sometimes it can be so cruel
The rain keeps falling on me so coldly
'cause your wishes didn't come true

Nothing seems real anymore
as I dive into the sea of lies
I don't understand this sorrow
that keeps me sane

They let you down, threw you in the rain
They let you down, sent you away... without a name

They let you down

The night is dark when you're alone
and sometimes it can be so cruel
The rain keeps falling on me so coldly
'cause your wishes didn't come true
