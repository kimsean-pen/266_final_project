Our love is for real
How'd it take a long long time
To let us feel
I try to relate in my state
But the aura around me says
Our love is for real

Baby baby baby
I been waiting for ya
Wanna be in love
Baby baby baby
I been waiting waiting waiting
My whole life for someone like you

Touching your face
How'd it take a long long time
To be here
Turning the wheel
On our street
And my heart still skips a beat
It's echoing echoing echoing

Baby baby baby
I been waiting for ya
Wanna be in love
Baby baby baby
I been waiting waiting waiting
My whole life for someone like you

It's true that everyone would like to have met
A love so real
Our love is for real

I know it
I've known it so long now
I'm nervous but
Into it
Inviting
I'll be there

Baby baby baby
I been waiting for ya
Wanna be in love
Baby baby baby
I been waiting waiting waiting
My whole life for someone like you
It's true that everyone would like to have met
A love so real
Our love is for real
