I've poured my tears in bottles
In case if I need them later
You never know
You never know
And if I get thirst
Will they make me sad?
Forever
Forever
Oh, cover your eyes, cover your eyes
Hide me inside, under your spine
Under your spine
Ho ho-ho-ho
Ho ho-ho-ho
Ho ho-ho-ho
Ho ho ho

I will kindly watch you sleep
I find out that your eyes are open
I hide other pieces that you never
Would've liked if you ever knew about them
So I hide my children
Oh, cover your eyes, cover your eyes
Hide me inside, under your spine
Under your spine
Ho ho-ho-ho
Ho ho-ho-ho
Under your spine
Ho ho-ho-ho
Ho ho-ho-ho
Under your spine

Oh, cover your eyes, cover your eyes
Hide me inside, under your spine
Under your spine
Ho ho-ho-ho
Ho ho-ho-ho
Under your spine
Ho ho-ho-ho
Ho ho-ho-ho
Under your spine
Down your spine
Down your spine
Down your spine
Down your spine
Ho ho-ho-ho
Under your spine
