Oooh oh
Mmm

This might be wrong, but he's all I know
He's all I know
And most times I pretend that he's just a friend
He's just a friend

Yeah, I'll try to make our hearts beat in time
Even though your rhythm might not be with mine

But darling I'm a mess without your love
Heaven knows I'm trying, I'm trying to get by
But darling I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one more goodbye kiss

Your lips are missed
'Cause they're all I know
I can't let you go
And I won't forget
All that you said is engraved in my head

Yeah, I'll try to make our hearts beat in time
Even though your rhythm might not be with mine

But darling I'm a mess without your love
Heaven knows I'm trying, I'm trying to get by
But darling I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one more goodbye kiss
No-oh-oh
A goodbye kiss
Oooh oooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Yeah I'll try to make our hearts beat in time
Even though your rhythm might not be with mine

But darling I'm a mess without your love (without your love)
Heaven knows I'm trying (mmm, woah) trying to get by (no, no)
(No, no, noooo) But darling I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one (one more) more goodbye (goodbye) kiss
