Ooh, la la la
La la, la la la
Ooh, la la la
You deserve more than a Cameo
How are you not in my video?
Lets take it back to my studio
And we can let it roll tonight.
Girl come with me now your scenes about to start
I do believe I can see you're a star
Don't know your name but you're made for the part
cause you're perfect babe
Time to work it babe
It's your undress rehearsal
so take your clothes off
show me how you show off
It's your undress rehearsal
you da main attraction
Lights, camera, action
Ooh, la la la
La la, la la la
Ooh, la la la
La la la la la la
Ooh, la la la
La la, la la la
Ooh, la la la
No you don't need to audition babe
don't need no headshots or pictures babe
There's no contract to negotiate
so we should let it roll tonight.

Stop, let the credits roll
On star status 'neath the telescope
Magazines at center fold
All the dudes like, she can get it though
she can get it though?
(She can get it though)
From the top down looking sexual
See that wardrobe at a war shows
Now that's your name in the envelope
It's your undress rehearsal
so take your clothes off
show me how you show off
It's your undress rehearsal
you da main attraction
Lights, camera, action
Ooh, la la la
La la, la la la
Everybody say: Ooh, la la la
