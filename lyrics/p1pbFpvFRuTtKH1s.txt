I ask myself why am I dying on the inside?
With no one left to call
And no one cares for me
The lesson I've learned hold onto your dreams
It might
Be the hardest part
I might
Get through the darkness
Inside
There's a riot forcing me to doubt

The question is why
Can't I get satisfied?
Be the lucky one
And have a normal life, without these brutal fights
Like everyone else

I'm wondering what
Can I do to move on?
Can I change to reach my aims?
I will try to do so
Cannot risk to switch my lane
It might
Be the hardest part
I might
Get through the darkness
Inside
There's a riot forcing me to doubt

The question is why
Can't I get satisfied?
Be the lucky one
And have a normal life, without these brutal fights
Like everyone else

Why can't I
Get what I want and move on?
Why can't I
Get what I want and move on?

And I don't know why I want to cry
(It feels like I'm losing this game)
Called life I died (Weeks ago but now)
It ends tonight (Open up that scar)
What is that might
That kills me every time?

The question is why
Can't I get satisfied?
Be the lucky one
And have a normal life, without these brutal fights
Like everyone else

Why can't I
Get what I want and move on?
Why can't I
Get what I want and move on?
