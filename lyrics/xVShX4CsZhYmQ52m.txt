in here for a moment
everyone in here heated up
overturning agents
you like it or you like it or not

caught up in this moment
stones are growing into rocks
night turns into morning
you like it or you like it or not

high or low
never never going down

high or low
never never going down

dancing in this shadow
grinding out and pushing our luck
days turn into years
you like it or you like it or not

high or low
never never going down

high or low
never never going down

high or low
never never going down

high or low
never never going down
