Is there something I'm not seeing?
Something you're not telling me?
'Cause I've been hearing different stories
I don't know what to believe

Is there a reason I'm not healing?
Or am I learning from this pain?
I have a little trouble kneeling
I don't know what to believe

But I'm ready to question
That life is a blessing
So give me a sign, am I following blind?
Is there anyone listening?
Is there anyone listening?
I don't know

See I've seen devils, I've seen saints
I've seen the lines between them fade
I've seen pictures with no meaning
I don't know what to believe

But I'm ready to question
That life is a blessing
Give me a sign, am I following blind?
Is there anyone listening?
Is there anyone listening?
I don't know

Does there have to be someone telling me?
This time wrong feels rights

But I'm ready to question
That life is a blessing
Give me a sign, am I following blind?
Is there anyone listening?
Is there anyone listening?

But I'm ready to question
That life is a blessing
Give me a sign, am I following blind?
Is there any one listening?
I don't know
