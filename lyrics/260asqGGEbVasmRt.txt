In the lovers' domain
Like a dream too wide for the brain
I can but hold to your shoulders like the edge of a cliff
And strain

Take pity
On a boy deployed in your sandpaper-palmed infinity
I beg you, take the time to mine good ore from me
I beg you, lay you down on me

Etch it on my psyche
Employed my body nightly
I bizarrely find some poise, find some poise
Naked in a poorly lit priory

Take pity
Shook by your cautious broad-stroke battery
And if I am out of bloom and lack your rain
I beg you, lay it down on me

Make grace
Lost in your sandpaper-palmed infinity
I can but hold to your shoulders like the edge of a cliff
And plead

And if I am out of bloom and lack your grace
I beg you, rain it down on me
