In time this won't even matter
This chapter will be long on the grass
And we'll talk about everything 'til it's easier
Your beauty is nothing compared to what

You Will Become
You Will Become
You Will Become
In time become

And we talked about talk of a gold ring
And you brought me one step closer to the heart of things
We talked about everything 'til we laughed about it
Your honesty is nothing compared to what

You Will Become
You Will Become
You Will Become
In time become

In time you won't even notice,
this chapter will belong on the grass.
We'll talk about everything 'till it's easier.
Your beauty is nothing compared to what

You Will Become
You Will Become
You Will Become
You Will Become
You Will Become
In time become
