We're going to the river to get some peace
And we're going to the valley bellow
You can meet me in the middle on your way
And we won't have to go alone
I know that it's better when we get along
And I think we found a way to get by
So easy when I think of the joy you bring
Instead of tryin' to prove I'm right
Our lives are just a river and we're all gonna meet in the ocean
Don't tell now, follow
We're wide awake at night
We've got skills but we're livin' on luck
I think we're doin' just fine
People have a way of lookin' at life
like things should be goin' their way
And if everything doesn't work out
that well, the whole world is gonna pay
Our lives are just a river, we're all gonna meet in the ocean
Don't tell now, follow
We're wide awake at night
We've got skills but we're livin' on luck
I think we're doin' just fine
Don't tell now, follow
We're wide awake at night
We've got skills but we're livin' on luck
I think we're doin' just fine
Don't tell now, follow
We're wide awake at night
We've got skills but we're livin' on luck
I think we're doin' just fine
