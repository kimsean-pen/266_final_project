I'm lost again
And I'm on the run
Looking for love
In a sad song

With your avenger eyes
And your catlike ways
I can hold you
You are a fool for me to be cruel

I'm leaning on this bar
Listening to you sing
And your sad song
Rings in my ears and I start to cry

He's searching
She's showing
See him held in a deep, deep spell
He knows she's glowing

I can find within my mind
A way to go
I can look deep into your light and shout
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me

I hear the saxophone
And it tears my soul
And we're feeling old
Feeling so cold

She is the torch
And she is the theme
She could be a dream
But - oh boy - is she real

Try to avoid her eyes
To avoid her words
They will hit you
With all that you feel

He's searching
She's showing
See him held in a deep, deep spell
He knows she's glowing

I can find within my mind
A way to go
I can look deep into your light and shout
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me

See her eyes they are bright tonight
See the stars coming out tonight
See the moon looking down tonight
See how they light your way tonight
(See my eyes they are bright tonight)
(See my hands reaching out tonight)
(Hear my words they are dynamite)
(See how they light your way tonight)
See her eyes they are bright tonight
See the stars coming out tonight
See the moon looking down tonight
See how they light your way tonight
See her eyes they are bright tonight
See how they light your way tonight
