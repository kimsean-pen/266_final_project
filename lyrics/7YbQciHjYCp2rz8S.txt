Something in the sun or the air
Is making me want to run away from here
I know that you want me to stay with you
But no
So I'll keep on making excuses about the sun, the earth, the rays

Our days are numbered, wired and I'm tired of it
I know you're trying
But you'll never unravel me

Unravel me, unravel
Unravel me, unravel

It's something about the season that we're in
That's making me think that we're not supposed to do this
I know that you're trying to understand
But you can't
'Cause I keep on making excuses about the fall, the rise

And how my mind is ruptured, wired and I'm tired of it
I know you're trying
But you'll never unravel me

Unravel me, unravel
Unravel me, unravel
Unravel me, unravel
Unravel me, unravel

Unravel
Unravel me, unravel
Unravel me, unravel
Unravel me, unravel
