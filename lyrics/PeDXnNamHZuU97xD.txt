You make me vicious
Watch as I make the pain my mistress
You can call me Miss Malicious
I'll dress you up in stitches
No, I can not resist this

If it don't hurt I get suspicious
I like to take the knife and twist it
Yeah my love is sacrilegious
I'm nuts, get to admit it
This violence is delicious

What doesn't kill me
Makes me vicious
I'm not gonna break
I can take all that you can give
This is survival
I'm the sickest
I am not afraid, bring the pain

Watch out 'cause I'm vicious
And I'm not asking for forgiveness
Yeah I'll make you go ballistic
Your torture is my business
And I won't leave a witness

I don't care if you'll hate me
'Cause you're gonna have to face me
And there's no use in crying
You know I would be lying
If I said you could escape me

What doesn't kill me
Makes me vicious
I'm not gonna break
I can take all that you can give
This is survival
I'm the sickest
I am not afraid, bring the pain

What doesn't kill me makes me... vicious
Vicious
Vicious
Vicious

What doesn't kill me
Makes me vicious
I'm not gonna break
I can take all that you can give
This is survival
I'm the sickest
I am not afraid, bring the pain
What doesn't kill me makes me... vicious
What doesn't kill me makes me... vicious
What doesn't kill me makes me... vicious
What doesn't kill me makes me... vicious
