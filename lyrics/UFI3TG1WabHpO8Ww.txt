Your pretty face disguised
in a veil of fear
drip with tears
as I gave you one last
kiss before the fall (before the fall)
Hold my hand you're so beautiful
let's escape from this life and end it all
on three we're jumping from this ledge
this buildings tall
I'm sure we'll wake up dead
but I still love her

Say goodbye say goodbye
ya we're falling fast
I'll live forever
Say goodbye say goodbye

A picture perfect attempt at
a quick and painless death
came and meant
something so much more
than all the rest (than all the rest)
Hold my hand and don't forget to breathe
there's nothing left for you
there's nothing left to leave
on three we're jumping from this ledge
this buildings tall
I'm sure we'll wake up dead
but I still love her

Say goodbye say goodbye
ya we're falling fast
I'll live forever
Say goodbye say goodbye
ya and make it last

With these moments we hold dear
(inside my heart)
and the seconds we have left
(inside my heart)
I know you're here inside my heart [2x]

Hold your hand with mine
in this picture perfect light
there's one last chance for us
tonight
I hold your hand with mine
so everything is fine
so say good by now say goodbye
tonight

Say goodbye say goodbye
ya we're falling fast
I'll live forever
Say goodbye say goodbye
ya we'll make it last
I'll live forever
Say goodbye say goodbye
ya we're falling fast
I'll live forever
Say goodbye say goodbye
