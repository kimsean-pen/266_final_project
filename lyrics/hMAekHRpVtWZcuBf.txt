With her wine-stained lips
Yeah, she's nothing but trouble
Cold to the touch, but she's warm as the devil
I gave her my heart, but she wanted my soul
She tasted a break and I can't get more

You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But I wouldn't change
No, I wouldn't change this love
You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But I wouldn't change
No, I wouldn't change this love

Tried to break the chains
But the chains only break me
Tried to break the chains
But the chains only break me

Alone in the night 'til she knocks on my door
Wasted again, but I can't say no
Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Gave you my heart, but you took my soul
You got me in chains (oh, baby)
You got me in chains for your love
But I wouldn't change (I wouldn't change)
No, I wouldn't change this love
You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But I wouldn't change (wouldn't change)
No, I wouldn't change this love

Tried to break the chains
But the chains only break me
Tried to break the chains
But the chains only break me

Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Gave you my heart, but you took my soul
You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But I wouldn't change
No, I wouldn't change this love
You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But I wouldn't change (uh)
No, I wouldn't change this love
Tried to break the chains
But the chains only break me
