Yeah

Relax, it's over
You belong to me, I fill your mouth with dirt
Relax, it's over
You can never leave, I take your second digit with me, love

You are my first
I can barely breathe, I find you fascinating
You are my favorite
Lay you down to sleep, it's all that I can do to stop, love

So blue, so broken
Paper doll decays, I haven't left you yet
So cold, subversive
Your eyes are full of bleach, tomorrow I will go away again, love

You are mine
You will always be mine
I can tear you apart
I can recombine you
All I want is to covet you all
You belong to me
I will kill you to love you
