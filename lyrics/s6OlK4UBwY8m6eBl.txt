Ohh yeah
Ohh yeah

You said "I got something to say"
Then you got that look in your eye
"There is something you've got to know"
You said it as you started to cry

"I've been down the wrong road tonight
And I swear I'll never go there again"
Ive seen this face once before
And I don't think I can do this again

There's something I can't see
There's something different in the way you smile
Behind those eyes you lie
And there's nothing I can say
'cause I'm never gonna change your mind
Behind those eyes you hide

As you turned to walk away
I saw another look in your eye
And even though it hurt like it did
I couldn't let this be your goodbye.

You say that you're sorry
And you say now that it hurts you the same
Is there something here to believe
Or is it just another part of the game?

Ohh yeah
Oh
Ohh woah

Behind those eyes you lie
Behind those eyes you hide

There's nothing I can say
That's ever gonna make you change your mind
Behind those eyes you hide

Behind those eyes you hide
