When you're stuck in a daydream
You can feel anything
Daydream baby
Did you take me all the way?

She was just a teardrop
I was just a waste of time
She was just a teardrop
I was just a waste of time

When you're stuck in a daydream
You can see any little thing
Daydream honey
Did you trust me all the way?

She was just a teardrop
I was just a waste of time
She was just a teardrop
I was just a waste of time

She was just a teardrop
I was just a waste of time
She was just a teardrop
I was just a waste of time
Time, time
Ohhhh
