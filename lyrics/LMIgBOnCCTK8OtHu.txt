Never done it the way I should
So impatient, misunderstood
I've always let a girl dictate my feelings, yeah
Too distracted, too direct
Too numb so I neglect
The things I should protect
I'm ready for what is next
I made mistakes, you made a judgement
Focus on a life with substance
I'm tired of waiting
I know I need to face it
I'm building, I'm zoning
I'll never be complacent
I'm on the way up
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been
Nothing can hold me
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been
They say hurry up and wait
Haha! Hurry up and wait
Eyes on the gold
And everytime I slip goal, I froze
Best cards in the fucking deck but I fold
It's like I'm stuck in a place that I can't call home
And I ain't circling the bottom no more
Why do I do this to myself?
Over and over again
I'm on the way up
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been
Nothing can hold me
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been
I'm on the way up
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been
Nothing can hold me
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been
And I can almost touch the sky
Keep my head down it's my time
No feeling dark, asking why
Keep my head down it's my time
I'm ready for what is next
I'm on the way up
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been
Nothing can hold me
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been
I'm on the way up
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been
Nothing can hold me
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been
