I'll love you 'til I die
How else will you decide
How hard you're gonna try
One more, one more?

God save how you believe
In your one true enemy
Don't know if I would need
One more, one more

I brought my baby to bed, ooh child
Broke her to pieces instead
It was a mean while
Oh how should I?
Why should I, why should I?

There is no clean sin
With half a skeleton
So soon to let you in
On the end of the gentleman
Send me into the sea
So I meet my family
All swinging arms and feet
Where could the bottom be?

All this time
A man alive
Look how I have grown
How I leave home

I brought my baby to bed, ooh child
Broke her to pieces instead
It was a mean while
Oh how should I?
Why should I, why should I?

There is no clean sin
With half a skeleton
So soon to let you in
On the end of the gentleman
Send me into the sea
So I meet my family
All swinging arms and feet
Where could the bottom be?

All this time
A man alive
Look how I have grown
How I leave home

I brought my baby to bed, ooh child
Broke her to pieces instead
It was a mean while
Oh how should I?
Why should I, why should I?

There is no clean sin
With half a skeleton
So soon to let you in
On the end of the gentleman
