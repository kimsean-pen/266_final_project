When did we become these sinking stones?
When did we build this broken home?
Holding each other like ransom notes
Dropping our hearts to grip our brother's throat

I'm on the bottom of the ocean floor
Eye for eye, drowning just to keep the score
Blaming the world outside ourselves
Surrounded by mirrors in a sinking shell
