You threw your books into the river
Told your Mom that you're a non-believer
She says she wasn't surprised but that doesn't make it ok

You say nobody loves a city
Nobody loves what can't love 'em back
One-way ticket in your pocket
What happened to the charm of a small town?

If you find what you're looking for
Be sure to send a postcard
You promised you'd never forget
The little ones when you got big

You deal an unspoken debt
No kindness without wanting something back
What do I owe you? What did I forget?
Are we even after all of that?

You shook my hand and said goodbye
You'll never let me see you cry again
What good has come from learning to pretend?
You said I could've been a better friend

If you find what you're looking for
Be sure to send a new address
And if you find what you're looking for
Write a letter and tell us what it is, and tell us what it is

Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out
Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out
Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out
Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out
