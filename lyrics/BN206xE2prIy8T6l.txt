An extraordinary guy can never have an ordinary day
He might live a long goodbye
But that is not for me to say
I dig his friends
I dig his shoes
But he is just a child with nothing to lose
But his mind, his mind
They are sleeping while they dream
But then they want to be adored
They who don't say what they mean
Will live and die by their own sword
I dig their friends
I dig their shoes
But they are like a child with nothing to lose
But their minds, yeah their minds
I'll have my way
In my own time
I'll have my say
My star will shine
'Cause you see me
I've got my magic pie
Think of me yeah that was me
I was that passer by
I've been and now I've gone
There are but a thousand days
But heading for a thousand years
Many minds to educate
And people who have disappeared
To dig my friends
To dig my shoes
I am like a child with nothing to lose
But my mind, yeah my mind
We'll have our way
In our own time
We'll have our say
'Cause my star's gonna shine
'Cause you see me
I've got my magic pie
Think of me, yeah
That was me I was the passer by
I've been and now I've gone
'Cause you see me
I've got my magic pie
Think of me, yeah
That was me I was that passer by
Think of me I've got my magic pie
Think of me, that was me, I was the passer by
I've been and now I've gone
Yeah yeah
