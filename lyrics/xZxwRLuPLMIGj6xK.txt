I think I'm burning up inside
I think I'll take a little ride
I'm gonna light up everything in sight, oh

Yeah I'll drive on by your yard
And throw a Molotov cocktail at your car
Then another one in the local bar, oh

Ignition, they call it an obsession
But I think it's kinda bitchin'
I think it's kinda neat

Yeah, I'm a pyro
I wanna burn it up
Yeah, I'm a pyro

Tonight this 'hood will be a pyre
I'm gonna set your house on fire
I'll dance around the pretty flames
Such a wonderful game

I want to make a tiki torch
I'm gonna throw it on your porch
Then I'm gonna run away
And come back another day, oh

Ignition, they call it an obsession
But I think it's kinda bitchin'
I think it's kinda neat

Yeah, I'm a pyro
I wanna burn it up
Yeah, I'm a pyro

So many houses, so little time
So many reasons, I'm not a crime
I'd like to set you up
I'd like to set you up

Ignition, they call it an obsession
But I think it's kinda bitchin'
I think it's kinda neat

Yeah, I'm a pyro
I wanna burn it up
Yeah, I'm a pyro
I wanna burn it up

Yeah, I'm a pyro
Yeah, I'm a pyro
Yeah, I'm a pyro
