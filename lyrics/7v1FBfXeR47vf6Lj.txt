You came to me with your heart open wide
You don't know what you mean to me
There are room in my life
And it feels good with you next to me
I've seen love
That's enough
Isn't life such a mystery
I'm in love with you love

There is pain in this world
I can see it in your eyes
And it's so hard to stay alive
At the end of the night
And it feels good when you're close to me
And I've seen love
That's enough
We will fade into history
I'm in love with you love

And it feels good when you're close to me
And I've seen love
That's enough
And I like your trajectory
I'm in love with you love
