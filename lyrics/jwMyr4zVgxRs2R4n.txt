this past week has been a strange one
lazy, new and good and bad
feelings come and go and change and
ac/dc, good and bad and sad

move to a bigger city
leave home and face the pity
I'd rather stay in bed
knowing that it won't be pretty

I've wasted a year or so
I lost my will some time ago
frustration comes when friends succeed in doing things
but then again that's me

I want to be a good friend
I want to find my best friend
someone who wants to stay
someone who doesn't go away
