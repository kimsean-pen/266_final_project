There's subtle voices on the wind
Asking me the same old things
They don't wanna be there for the comedown
But they sure do wanna see it
Caught me feeling so damn empty
But you never will admit it
You like me better on the outside
So you don't have to deal with it

You're casting stones in my direction
Gotta check on what I do
I'm surrounded by glass houses
Just trying to see what I've been through

Just kick rocks, kick rocks
Till your heart stops beating
Chew glass, chew glass
Till your mouth stops bleeding

I can tell you stories
I can open up my scars
I can tell you why I had to do it
Had to fill my head with stars

You're casting stones in my direction
Gotta check on what I do
I'm surrounded by glass houses
Just trying to see what I've been through

Just kick rocks, kick rocks
Till your heart stops beating
Chew glass, chew glass
Till your mouth stops bleeding

I am fighting, believe me
But you want me down on my knees
I feel you look down on me
Take it all, take the air that I breathe
I know, I should know better
But when you're under the weather
It's hard to pull it together
If not now, maybe never

So just kick rocks, kick rocks
Till your heart stops beating
Chew glass, chew glass
Till your mouth stops bleeding
Kick rocks, kick rocks
Till your heart stops beating
Chew glass, chew glass
Till your mouth stops bleeding
