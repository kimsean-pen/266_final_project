It's a call coming from your house
She's yelling from the window frame
You want to ignore it but there's no one else
No one, no one, no one, no one left to play

Come on, Stella
Come on, Stella
Come on, Stella
Get in the house, it's time for your dinner

Come on, Stella
Come on, Stella
Come on, Stella
Get in the house now, wash your face, girl

You're so little but you hear it loud
Tired and dirty, yea, but you're happy proud
No way, merman, no way, no way, not today
I'm gonna run - you can't catch me

Come on, Stella
Come on, Stella
Come on, Stella
Get in the house, it's time for your dinner

Come on, Stella
Come on, Stella
Come on, Stella
Get in the house now, wash your face, girl
