I remember every summer by the lake
Where the moon met the shore on walks we take
Getting into all the trouble we could find
And the bruised and battered knees it left behind

Into blue, next to you
Into blue, you left me holding on

Sitting in that ugly chair you gave to me
You said time for me to go ill let you be
Now its difficult at losing track of time

Vertical living on a single line

Into blue, next to you
Into blue, you left me holding on
Into blue, next you
Into blue, you left me holding on
