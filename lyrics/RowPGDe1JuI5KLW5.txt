Don't sing if you want to live long
they have no use for your song
you're dead, you're dead, you're dead
you're dead and outta this world.

You'll never get a second chance
plan all your moves in advance
stay dead, stay dead, stay dead
stay dead and outta this world.

Run fast don't stand in the sun
there's too much work to be done
you're down, you're down, you're down
youre down and outta this world.

Don't ever talk with your eyes
be sure that you compromise
you're dead, you're dead, you're dead
you're dead and outta this world.

Hear the unloved weeping like rain
guard your sleep from the sound of their pain
long gone, long gone, long gone
long gone and outta this world.

When you smile and it tears your face
it's time for the inhuman race
you're down, you're down, you're down
you're down and outta this world.

Now your hope and compassion is gone
you've sold out your dream to the world
stay dead, stay dead, stay dead
you're dead and outta this world.
