I am but cloth, weak to the frost
Weak to the gleaming blade, weak to the moth
But brave on your skin, bright in its whims
An October wind is prevailing again

So, who will house my sentiment?
It comes in floods and runs me red
Rattling the dewy moss with my lost footsteps, and I'm not done yet
Kiss and kiss but can't beget, and I'm not done yet

I am but cloth, weak to the frost
Weak to the gleaming blade, weak to the moth
But I'm brave on your skin and good in its whims
An October wind prevailing again

I'm a consort on holiday
(Do more of the same)
Browsing men and lingerie
(Do more of the same)
Rattling the morning lot with each new amulet, and I'm not done yet
(Do more of the same)
Kiss and kiss but can't beget, and I'm not done yet

Frock both catch and confound the candlelight
(Do more of the same)
I'll stay, if only too afraid to hobble home tonight
(Do more of the same)
Dawn, rattling the morning moss with my lost footsteps
And I'm not done yet
(Do more of the same)
Kiss and kiss but can't beget, and I'm not done yet
(Do more of the same)
And I'm not done yet
(Do more of the same, do more of the same)
I'm not done yet, I'm not done yet
I'm not, I'm not done yet
