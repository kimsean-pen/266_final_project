Early Monday morning, til Friday at five
Man I work, work, work but I don't climb, climb, climb
Boss man can shove that overtime up his can
All I wanna do is put a drink in my hand

To fill it up, or throw it down
I got a 40 hour week worth of trouble to drown
No need to complicate it, I'm a simple man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

Yea the parking lot is muddy, can't get to the door
I'll take my jacked up drop er' down in 4 by 4
Chill down a long neck, warm up the band
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand

To fill it up, or throw it down
I'm about to tear a new one in this old town
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 I'm a rocket man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

Make me wanna go ouhhh ouh ouhhh, when you dance like that
you got that little tattoo playing peek-a-boo on your back
Yea if you want to impress me, baby here's my plan
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

Yea fill it on up, or throw it down
When you drive me home, take the long way around
You be my Lois Lane, I'll be your Superman
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

My head Monday morning that alarm clock sings
it goes bang, bang, bang, while it ring, ring, rings
Yea I'll let it all roll, if you wanna rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

Yea fill it up, or throw it down
I got a little hungover, still hanging around
That hair of a dog is howlin' "hey there man"
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
That hair of a dog is howlin' "hey there man"
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
Haaaaouuhhhhh
