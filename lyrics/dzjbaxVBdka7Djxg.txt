I'm in love with a girl I hate
She enjoys pointing out
Every bad thing about me
I'm in love with a critic and a skeptic

A traitor
I'd trade her in a second...
She's a backseat driver
A drama provider

An instant update of the world
She's a first-class liar
A constant forgetter (She's attractive but bitter)
Did you scream enough to make her cry
Did you turn around
Turn around

Baby don't return to me
If you think
That I'm not worth your time
She's a lady
And ladies
Shouldn't be mesed with

She's a lady
And ladies
Shouldn't be messed with
Take off your shoes
Come in the room
And baby let's try not to argue

Turn out the lights
Turn on the radio
How can we fight when I'm too busy loving you
I'm too busy loving you
Did you scream enough to make her cry

Did you turn around
Turn around
Baby don't return to me
If you think

That I'm not worth your time
She's a lady
And ladies
Shouldn't be messed with
She's a lady
And ladies
Shouldn't be messed with
Here I am
There you go again
Again
And we will not ever be 18 again
Again
And I'm worn out of fighting
And every night you leave crying
And I could use some time
And here I am
There you go again
Again
So here I am, dying
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Come back, come back to me
And I'll take you gladly
And I'll take you anyway
Did you scream enough to make her cry
Did you turn around
Turn around
Baby don't return to me
If you think
That I'm not worth your time
She's a lady
And ladies
Shouldn't be messed with
