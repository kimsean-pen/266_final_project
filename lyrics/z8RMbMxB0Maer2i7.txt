Don't let them in
I am too tired
To hold myself carefully
And wink when they circle
The fact that I'm trapped
In this body

Don't let them in
I have my own dreams
About that couple

In an alternate ribbon of time
My dances were sacred
My lisp was evidence
I spoke for both spirits

Don't let them in
Their will intended
But each comment rattles them deep
Ancient queen
