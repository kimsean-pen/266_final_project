She Feels The Ground Is Giving Way
Bur She Thinks We're Better Off That Way
The More You Take The Less You Feel
The Less You Know The More You Believe
The More You Have The More It Takes Today

You Got To Give It Away
You Got To Give It Away
You Got To Give It Away
She Doesn't Care What It's Worth
She's Living Like It's The Last Night On Earth

She's Not Waiting On A Saviour To Come
She's At A Bus-Stop With The news of the world
And The Sun Sun Here It Comes
She's Not Waiting For Anyone

You Got To Give It Away
You Got To Give It Away
You Got To Give It Away
She Knows Just What It's Worth
She's Living Like It's The Last Night On Earth

Slipping Away... Slip Slide...
(The Clock Tells Her That Time Is Slipping...)
The World Turns And We Get Dizzy
(Minute Hands And Second Sticking...)
Slipping Away
(There's Something Going On She Might Be Missing
The World Turns And We Get Dizzy
Is It Spinning For You The Way It's Spinning For Me)

She's Living Living Next Week Now
You Know She's Going To Pay It Back Somehow
The Future Is Here At Last
The Past Is Too Uncomfortable

You Got To Give It Away
You Got To Give It Away
You Got To Give It Away

She Already Knows It Hurts
She's Living Like It's The Last Night On Earth
Last Night On Earth
Last Night On Earth.
