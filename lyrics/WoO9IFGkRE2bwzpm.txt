You're lying again
You say you don't but then you do
I'm trying again
To build a wall around your heart
Then break it through
To you

You make it happen
Everything's blue now
Oh lucky you
Oh lucky you
There's nothing to lose
So if it's really true oh lucky you

You're chasing the moon
Reaching out to touch the stars
But you land too soon
What will it take to make you see
The way things really are
We've come this far
So let it happen

Everything's blue now
Oh lucky you
Oh lucky you
There's nothing to lose
So if it's really true oh lucky you
You're lying again

Give it up and tell the truth
You can't stop the rain
It's gonna fall on every roof
I've got the proof
And only you
Can make it happen

Everything's blue now
Oh lucky you
Oh lucky you
There's nothing to lose
So if it's really true oh lucky you
