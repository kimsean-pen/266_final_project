The air is getting thin
The walls are closing in around me
But I can't get enough
Washed out, love struck
I'm fading, yeah
I'm fading

And I can't tell you when
I'm gonna feel right in the head
Well give me some space
Give me some time
I'll feel fine
But right now I'm jaded

'Cause I'm solid gone
Where did it all go wrong?
Will you stay the night
Will you stay the night, oh
Stay the night
Yeah, I wanna get to know ya

Stay the night
Will you stay the night, oh
Stay the night
'Cause I like the way you make me
Feel out of control
I'm gonna climb back out that hole
You've put me in

Yeah I feel it in my soul
Now won't you stay the night
Stay the night now baby
Tame me with your touch
So soothing, don't interrupt

Dissolve me and realign
I'm separated
And crystallized
I'm bruised and broken
So outspoken
So close to losing it
So close to losing it

I'm feeling run down
My place on the edge of town
Yeah, I'm losing it
'Cause I'm solid gone
Where did it all go wrong?

Stay the night
Will you stay the night, oh
Stay the night
'Cause I like the way you make me
Feel out of control
I'm gonna climb back out that hole
You've put me in

Yeah I feel it in my soul
Now won't you stay the night
Stay the night now baby
(Stay the night)
Hard liquor was guaranteed
You don't belong to me
(Stay the night)
The company I crave
All living in a daze
(Stay the night)
Hard liquor was guaranteed
You don't belong to me
(Stay the night)
The company I crave
(Now won't you stay the night)
(Stay the night, stay the night)
All living in a daze
