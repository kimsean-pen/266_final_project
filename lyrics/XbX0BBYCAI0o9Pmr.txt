Can't be sleeping, keep on waking
Without the woman next to me
Guilt is burning, inside I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can keep

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me

Can't you see it?
I was manipulated by it
To let her through the door

I had no choice in this
I was a friend she missed
She needed me to talk

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me

Oh, I'm so sorry, so sorry, baby
Yeah
Ooh, I got to say
So sorry

Oh, I promise
(I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
