Like a cause without a martyr,
Like an effigy of balsa,
Like a hairline crack in a radiator,
Leaking life

I shout out but it just spins faster,
I'd crawl out but my knees are water,
I cling on by my nails to this sweet disaster

And I fall to the floor like my strings are cut,
Pinch myself but I don't wake up,
Spit in the wind cause too much is not enough,
It starts and ends with you,
It starts and ends with you

And I've worn so many faces,
Shot my love at fifteen paces,
My inheritance is all the thoughts I can't sweep away,

I shout out but it just spins faster,
I'd crawl out but my knees are water,
I cling on by my nails to this sweet disaster

And then I fall to the floor like my strings are cut,
Pinch myself but I don't wake up,
Spit in the wind cause too much is not enough,
It starts and ends with you,
It starts and ends with you

Shout out but it just spins faster,
Crawl out but my knees are water,
Cling on by my nails to this sweet disaster

And then I crash to the floor like my strings are cut,
Spit in the wind myself but I don't wake up
Pinch myself cause too much is not enough
It starts and ends with you,
It starts and ends with you,
It starts and ends with you,
It starts and ends with you

I shout out but it just spins faster,
I'd crawl out but my knees are water
I shout out but it just spins faster,
I'd crawl out but my knees are water
I shout out but it just spins faster,
I'd crawl out but my knees are water
I shout out but it just spins faster,
I'd crawl out but my knees are water
