It wouldn't hurt to give you more my love
The sun shines through into a wave of thought
You said the one I wed
has got a thinking hand on her
Her will will shine from up above on us
Cuz everyday I build on precious hurt and I
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel
I fill her heart with a lot of love so the sun can shine a little brighter

On her and I
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I

It wouldn't hurt to give you more my love
The sun shines through into a wave of thought
You said the one I wed
has got a thinking hand on her
Her will will shine from up above on us
Cuz everyday I build on precious hurt and I
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel
I fill her heart with a lot of love so the sun can shine a little brighter

On her and I
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I

It wouldn't hurt to give you more my love
The sun shines through into a wave of thought
You said the one I wed
has got a thinking hand on her
Her will will shine from up above on us
Cuz everyday I build on precious hurt and I
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel
I fill her heart with a lot of love so the sun can
shine a little brighter

On her and I
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I
