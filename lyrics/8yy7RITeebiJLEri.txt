I'm alive! (Alive)

So you were six feet underneath me
I felt a pulse, I swear you moved
And digging deep, deep down, I recognized
How much you had to lose
And if you wanna get out of here
Wanna get out of here, save yourself
But you'll never get anywhere
Never get anywhere, not without my help

(Say it with me)

I'm alive, I'm alive when you're dead inside
I'm a slap in the face to your lullaby
Got you all tongue tied
'Cause you're living a lie, my friend
Say it with me
I'm alive, I'm alive when you're dead inside
I'm your wake up call
And you know I'm right
So make a move, let it bleed
Tear your heart off your sleeve
But I'm the only one who's gonna save your life
I'm the one who's gonna save your life
I'm the one who's gonna...

So how far did you go for shelter?
How long did it take you to find
A place to sell your providence
And harm your peace of mind?
And if you wanna get out of here
Wanna get out of here, save yourself
But you'll never get anywhere
Never get anywhere, not without my help

(Say it with me)

I'm alive, I'm alive when you're dead inside
I'm a slap in the face to your lullaby
Got you all tongue tied
'Cause you're living a lie, my friend
Say it with me
I'm alive, I'm alive when you're dead inside
I'm your wake up call
And you know I'm right
So make a move, let it bleed
Tear your heart off your sleeve
But I'm the only one who's gonna save your life
I'm the one who's gonna save your life
I'm the one who's gonna...

I'm alive, I'm alive when you're dead inside
I'm a slap in the face to your lullaby
Got you all tongue tied
'Cause you're living a lie my friend
Say it with me
I'm alive, I'm alive when you're dead inside
I'm your wake up call
And you know I'm right
So make a move, let it bleed
Tear your heart off your sleeve
But I'm the only one who's gonna save your life

I'm the one who's gonna save your life
I'm the one who's gonna save your life
I'm the one who's gonna save your life
I'm the one who's gonna save your life
