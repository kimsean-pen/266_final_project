Take it in while you can
On the edge of it all
Feel the wind
Awake my skin
On the edge of it all

I feel it coming
Hold your breath, don't let go
I feel it coming
Hold your breath, don't let go
I feel it coming
I feel it coming
I feel it coming
I feel it coming

Fire away something calls
On the edge of it all
Face the fire, let it come
On the edge of it all

Hold your breath, don't let go
I feel it coming
Hold your breath, don't let go
I feel it coming
I feel it coming
I feel it coming
I feel it coming
I feel it coming
