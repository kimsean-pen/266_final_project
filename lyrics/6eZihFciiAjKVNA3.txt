I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got

I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
'Cause I would really, really
Love to stick around, oh yeah

Heaven knows
I was just a young boy
Didn't know what
I wanted to be
Didn't know what

I wanted to be
I was every little hungry
Schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race?
A prettier face!

Brand new clothes and
A big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way
I play the game is not the same
No way
Think I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's
Something you
Should know
I think it's time
I told you so

There's something
Deep inside of me
There's someone
Else I've got to be
Take back your
Picture in a frame

Take back your
Singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes
Do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and
Make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't
Belong to me yeah, yeah

Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
You've gotta give
For what you take

Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
You've gotta give
For what you take

Heaven knows we sure
Had some fun boy
What a kick just a buddy and me
What a kick just a buddy and me
We had every big shot

Good-time band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a

Brand new face
For the boys on MTV
But today the way
I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something
You should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes
Do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and
Make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong
To me, yea yea

Freedom (I won't let you down)
Freedom (I will not give you up)
Freedom
(Gotta have some faith in the sound)
You've gotta give for what you take
(It's the one good thing that I've got)
Freedom

(I won't let you down)
Freedom
(So please don't give me up)
Freedom
('Cause I would really, really love to stick around)
You've gotta give for what you take

Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which
Side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well

Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get, that's what you get
That's what you get, I said that's what you get
That's what you get, for changing your mind
That's what you get, for changing your mind
That's what you get, that's what you get

And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes
Do not make the man, do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and
Make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong
To me, yea yea

Freedom, oh
Freedom
Freedom
You've got to give for what you take

Freedom (hold onto my)
Freedom
Freedom
You've got to give for what you take
You've got to give for what you take

Yeah, you've got to give for
What you, give for what you give
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now
I've got to live I've got to live
