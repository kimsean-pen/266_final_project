Krill edible oceans at their feet
A troublesome troop out on safari
A lullaby holds their drones in sleep

For tatteling clearly indiscreet
Five fallible flags in hybersonic
Are told to stay nearly out of reach
And in space, two receivers turn away
Just in case, two receivers turn away
To displace, two receivers turn away
And in space

Submissions in outer regions pleased
A gathering of teens in old sargasso
Whos mission is to fall flat at their feet

While sat on a sparsely crowded beach
Marine noticed change in perfect timing
A widow to all but her pastiche

And in space, two receivers turn away
Just in case, two receivers turn away
To displace, two receivers turn away
And in space

Eternal flow
Strings to your bow
Roam through the globe

Eternal flow
Strings to your bow
Roam through the globe

(Krill edible oceans at their feet) Eternal flow
(A troublesome troop out on safari) Strings to your bow
(A lullaby holds their drones in sleep) Roam through the globe

And in space (krill edible oceans at their feet) (eternal flow)
Two receivers turn away (A troublesome troop out on safari) (strings to your bow)
Just in case (A lullaby holds their drones in sleep) (Roam through the globe), two receivers turn away

To displace (krill edible oceans at their feet) (eternal flow)
Two receivers turn away (A troublesome troop out on safari) (strings to your bow)
And in space (A lullaby holds their drones in sleep) (Roam through the globe)
