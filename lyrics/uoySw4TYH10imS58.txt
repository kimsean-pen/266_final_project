Tell me a line
Make it easy for me
Open your arms
Dance with me until I feel alright

It's good in the dark
Good in the dark
But into the lover's light
Here comes another fight

So ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Bar me and hold me and cling to my arm
Here it comes, here it comes

And what you're asking me now
Disastrous now
Hoping and hoping, and hoping
The feeling goes away

Never change, never change
Never change, never change
Never change, never change
Never change, this is why I fell in love, oh

Never change, never change
Never change, never change
Never change, never change
Never change, that's just too up there in love with

Oh, this is the time
The very best time
So give me a line and take me home
Take me over

But dashing the hopes
Dashing the hopes
And smashing the pride
The morning's got you on the ropes, oh

And love is a murderer
Love is a murderer
But if she calls you tonight
Everything is alright, yeah, we know

And love is a curse
Shout in a hearse
Love is an open book
To a of your bad poetry
And this is coming from me

But I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love

I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love

Turn on the light
Make it easy for me
Fill the divide
Fumble in the kitchen 'til it's right
What an awful sight

But there's love in your eyes
Love in your eyes, love in your eyes
But maybe that's just your lover finds
All night

And I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love

And I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love

And I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love

And I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love
