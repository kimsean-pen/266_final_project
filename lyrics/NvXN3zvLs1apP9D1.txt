Ohh, ooo, ooo
Ohh, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo
Ohh, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo
Ohh, ooo, ooo, ooo
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ooo

I heat up and I
I can't come down
Swear I'm spinnin'
I'm on a merry go round
And I picked up a
Joy to my face
My heart beats faster
Than a regular pace
And I'm not sure
Of what it is
I asked my mother
To help me with it
And she said, "Daughter
You reached a Jones
And that's real lovin'
So carry on"

Come to my place
(You know I'll be waitin' for ya)
'Cause I really need you so
(You know I'll be waitin' for ya)
Be on your way
(You know I'll be waitin' for ya)
And we can handle it real slow
(You know I'll be waitin' for ya)

You keep me thirsty
Lickin' my lips
I'm hungry for you
To please my hips
And don't stop there
Prepare to sweat
I'm gettin' hotter
And you ain't made it here yet
So won't you hurry
Make no haste
'Cause you're the fruit
I long to taste
Just in case
(Case)
I start before
('Fore)
Reach me first
Unlatched the door

I can't wait until you come over
(Come over)
(I can't wait)
Ohh, I can't wait until you come over
(No)
I can't wait until you come over
(Can't wait)
Ohh, I can't wait until you come over
(Ooh)

I made you wait
So patiently
(Ooh, ooo, ooo)
Now's the time
Come share with me
(Ooh, ooo, ooo)
I teased you so
Those days are gone
(Ooh, ooo, ooo)
Come over, it's on
And you don't have to wait no more
(Ooh, ooo, ooo)
Come over, boy, my place

(You know I'll be waitin' for ya)
'Cause I, I really need you so
(You know I'll be waitin' for ya)
Be on your way, yea, hee
(You know I'll be waitin' for ya)
And we can handle it real slow
(You know I'll be waitin' for ya)

Ooh, ooo
(Ooh, ooo, ooo, ooo)
Ooh, ooo
(Ooh, ooo, ooo, ooo)
Ooh, ooo, ooo
(Ooh, ooo, ooo, ooo)
My place
Ooh, ooo, ooo
Ooh
Can't wait 'till you come over
Oh, I can't wait until
I can't wait until you come
