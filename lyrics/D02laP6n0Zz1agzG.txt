Shapes melt in the air
The horizon becomes a tear
You cut quite the figure
I watch you shimmer

Scratching my eyes,
The castles in the skies are towering.
I see you standing there,
Bent double in the glare
You are stooping.
The sky is on the sand,
The world is in your hands
It's looming.
I haven't drank for days,
I'm heady with the haze
I'm sinking.

Bending lazily
Beckoning to me
Just a yellow dust
Delirious

Scratching my eyes,
The castles in the skies are towering.
I see you standing there,
Bent double in the glare
You are stooping.
The sky is on the sand,
The world is in your hands
It's looming.
I haven't drank for days,
I'm heady with the haze
I'm sinking.
