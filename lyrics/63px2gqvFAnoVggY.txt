Some days I want love and some days I don't
Sometimes I can feel it then suddenly it's gone
Some days I can tell you the truth
And some days I just don't

Only a change of mood, sun goes down
Someone says something too quick or too soon
A touch not made, one made too late
Armies of words cannot hope to contain

That it comes and it goes and I have no control

Some days I can think clear and some days I won't
Sometimes I can feel it and suddenly it's gone
Some days I'm strong
And some days my skin's broken and thin

It arrives when it feels and takes what it needs
And it leaves before I get to know
It's only a step away moments
Then armies of words cannot hope to contain

That it comes and it goes and I can't make it hold
And there's nothing I own and it breaks me when it goes

Some days I want love and some days I don't
Sometimes I can feel it then suddenly it's gone
Some days I can tell you the truth
And some days I just don't

Only a change of mood, dream comes out
Someone does something too quick or too soon
A move not made, one made too late
Armies of words cannot hope to contain

That it comes and it goes and I can't seem to hold
And there's nothing I own and it breaks me when it goes
