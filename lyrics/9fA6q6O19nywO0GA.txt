So far
I've been lost and lead by your stars
Tonight I'm seeing nothing but dark
Pull all the lights together

So run
Scared to show the things we all want
Held by all the sparks that had begun
Suddenly the coldest one

But we're all chasing gold
We won't find it alone

And now I know what love is
I can't believe we lost it
A shadow on the surface
Fades into the moon
Now I know what love is
I can't believe we lost it
Maybe I'm still learning

These blows
Close beneath the skin, now we both close
The cold is creeping in, but I still know
Just how much you used to glow

But we're all chasing gold
We won't find it alone

And now I know what love is
I can't believe we lost it
Our shadow on the surface
Fades into the moon
Now I know what love is
I can't believe we lost it
Maybe I'm still learning

Ooooh
Ooooh
Now I know what love is
Ooooh

And now I know what love is
I can't believe we lost it
Our shadow on the surface
Fades into the moon
Now I know what love is
I can't believe we lost it
Maybe I'm still searching
