Crawl!
War!

Do you hear revolution's call?
Time to fight our own denial
Warmongers keep us locked in fear
Invoke the past, a moment of tears
An ugly truth put forth by our youth
Under the threat of patriotic brute
So use your rage
It is a weapon we now must engage
Let trumpets sound our call
Or by their lies we will fall

Gnash down our teeth in hate and sing
Sing revolution's song (whey they say die)
Die for America

War!

They say that freedom isn't free
It's paid with the lives of sons and families
'Cause blood is their new currency
And oil pumps the heart of money
So fight as one without a fucking gun
Words are the bullets to this revolution
Use your pain
The battlegrounds, the streets are ablaze
Excess will pave their path
The winds of change, our bloodbath

Gnash down our teeth in hate and sing
Sing revolution's song (when they say die)
Die for America

Power and prejudice
Actions they use to pit against
Terror, insurgency
Words used to scare conformity
It's propaganda, it's their hypocrisy
Free to choose our own slavery
All suffer humanity

Raise your fists and
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
So fight for all that you love
Scream, choking with foot upon throat
Blind, scar spangled eyes
Death, no more the truth you will hide, no, no more

So how do they sleep?
While our mothers weep
They're selling our souls (they're selling our souls)
And our blood for oil

Our generation can be the fucking one
That overcomes the greed of corrupt nations
Have no shame
You're not alone in thinking, this is fucking insane
Rise up and take your stand
You curl the fingers of your hand

I don't know what to do
'Cause I don't have the answers
With every ounce of strength
I'll vow to fight this cancer
Didn't say I want to lead
I just might let you down
Didn't say believe in me
Just hold this common ground
I'm just as lost as you
And probably more confused
So fucking far from perfect
My mind wrecked from abuse
There's something fucking wrong
When war takes sons and daughters
Our lambs misled to slaughter
War!
Clenching the fists of dissent
Lies!
Clenching the fists of dissent
Fear!
Clenching the fists of dissent
Change!
Clenching to hope
