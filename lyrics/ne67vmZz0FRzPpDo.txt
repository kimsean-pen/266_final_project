You are young and dumb like I was
Time for you to run away cause

They only love you if you follow
They only love you if you swallow
They only love you if you beg or borrow
They only love you when you act so hollow

Hey beware
It's a scary world
Demons everywhere
Deep inside a girl
So unfair
Such an ugly place
Only seems to care
About a pretty face

Take a pill to make you brand new
But the monsters stay inside you

They only love you if you follow
They only love you if you swallow
They only love you if you beg or borrow
They only love you when you act so hollow

Hey beware
It's a scary world
Demons everywhere
Deep inside a girl
So unfair
Such an ugly place
Only seems to care
About a pretty face

Take a pill to make you brand new
But the monsters stay inside you
