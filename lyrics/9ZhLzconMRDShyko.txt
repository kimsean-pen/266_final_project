When you're out with the boys,
Ever contemplate on telling her,
Exactly where we'll be?
Exactly where we'll be?

And when you're out with the boys,
Would you ever contemplate on ditching us,
As soon as she turns up?
As soon as she turns up?

Ooh, you've got priorities,
But they're really not sitting that comfortably with me.

Mate! Do you know how much you've changed?
Where's my buddy I was hanging out with yesterday?
My friend, my friend, my friend,
It's best you learn to wait,
Or you'll end up having new friends,
That you can bail on

When you're out with your girl,
Do you realize that no one wants to talk to ya?
It's cause you're such a bore!
Such a bore

Ooh, you've got priorities,
But they're really not sitting that comfortably with me.

Mate! Do you know how much you've changed?
Where's my buddy I was hanging out with yesterday?
My friend, my friend, my friend,
It's best you learn to wait,
Or you'll end up having new friends,
That you can bail on

Miss you pumpkin, I miss you babe,
Wish you could hear what you're saying.
Miss you princess, I miss you babe,
Makes me sick hearing you saying...

I miss you pumpkin, I miss you babe,
I miss you princess, I miss you babe,
I miss you honey, my little angel.
Come every hour of everyday!
Puppies, sunsets and pretty rainbows
That's the price you'll pay

Mate! Do you know how much you've changed?
Where's my buddy I was hanging out with yesterday?
My friend, my friend, my friend,
It's best you learn to wait,
Or you'll end up having new friends,

[x2]

That's the price you'll pay...
