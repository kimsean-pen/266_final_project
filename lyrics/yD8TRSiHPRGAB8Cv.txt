Wooooo hoooo!
Wooooo hoooo!
Wooooo hoooo!
Wooooo hoooo!

I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
but nothing i-is
No

Wooooo hooooooo!
When I feel heavy metal
Wooooo hooooooo!
And I feels that i made all
Wooooo hooooooo!
Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I am never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head down
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

Wooooo hooooooo!
When I feel heavy metal
Wooooo hooooooo!
And I feels that i made all
Wooooo hooooooo!
Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I am never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you
Yeah yeah!...
