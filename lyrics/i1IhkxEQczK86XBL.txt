Twenty three seconds
All things we love will die
Twenty three magic
If you can change your life

Your tainted heart, your tainted heart
My tainted love, my tainted love
Repent now
How many times
As long as you live
How many times
The world will go around

He was a friend of mine
He was a son of god
He was a son of a gun
He was a son of god

He was a friend of mine
He was a son of god
He was a son of a gun
He was a son of god

Twenty three seconds
In you I see a chance
Twenty three magic
If you change the name of love

Your crazy heart
My crazy love
Repent now

How many times
As long as you wish
How many times
The world will go around

How many times
As long as you want
How many times
The world will go around

He was a friend of mine
He was a son of a gun
He was a son of god
He was a son of god

He was a friend of mine
He was a son of a gun
He was a son of god
He was a son of god

He was a friend of mine
He was a son of a gun
He was a son of god
He was a son of god

Twenty three...
