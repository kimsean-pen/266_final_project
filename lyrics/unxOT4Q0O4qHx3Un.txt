I'll give you each love letter back
We'll laugh before every joke is told
We'll pose after every photograph
Has been removed from the negative

With every smile we lose a line
Watch the stars fall back into the sky
Cork the wine
Unbake a cake
Take the dog back to the RSPCA

But I don't mind losing you this time

I'll meet you coming backwards
Yes, I'll meet you coming back
When the universe has expanded
Time will contract
You'll come back
And I'll meet you coming backwards
Next time

We make-up start an argument
Tears crawl back into your...
I turn from a friend
Of your friend
Unintroduced
Forget your name forevermore

But I don't mind losing you this time

I'll meet you coming backwards
Yes I'll meet you coming back
When the universe has expanded
Time will contract
You'll come back
And I'll meet you coming backwards
Yes I'll meet you coming back
But we move forward
Into emptiness
Into the void
Into the universe

We'll part as happy strangers
From a long friendship
That grew from
Such a love
From such a love
From such a love
Such a love
Oh such a...
