Morning mist
Assembles on the window dew
Branches droop
From the tree's rotting roots

Young blindness
It is often you don't care
Young blindness
Might not seem important yet

Generous
Benefits
Draw the line somewhere
Constant
Disorder
This bridge can't be repaired

Young blindness
It is often you don't care
Young blindness
Might not seem important yet

Leave it in my letterbox
Erased from my thoughts
Shameless and contagious
My trust won't be bought
I can't afford to lose any more

Young blindness
It is often you don't care
Young blindness
Might not seem important yet
