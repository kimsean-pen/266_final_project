If the radiance of a thousand suns
Were to burst into the sky
If the radiance of a thousand suns
Were to burst into the sky
That would be like the splendor of the Mighty One
I am become Death
Destroyer of Worlds
Destroyer of Worlds

If the radiance of a thousand suns
Were to burst into the sky
That would be like the splendor of the Mighty One
I am become Death
Destroyer of Worlds
