One by one
every courtesy is gone
and the show begins
Bring on the clowns
Pain is quiet
I've laughed at silence
for the last time

Let the show begin
for the last time

Sometimes one,
sometimes each of us is wrong
but the show begins
Bring on the clowns
blind to reason
These eyes are dreaming
for the last time
Let the show begin
for the last time
Let the show begin

(Instrumental)

Bring on the clowns
Smiling sweetly
doubt may leave me
for the last time

Let the show begin
for the last time
Let the show begin

Let the show begin
for the last time,
for the last time

Let the show begin
for the last time,
for the last time

for the last time,
for the last time,
for the last time

7. Call In The Night Boy

Say goodnight
Every hour brings
the morning of my life
Out of time
Every step I take
is further down the line

Here I stand left behind
My eyes open wide
If you need me you should try
calling the night boy

call in
call in the night boy

Say goodnight
Every hour brings
the morning of my life
Out of tune
Every breath I take
I take it over you

I don't care
what people say
I don't care
Night is Day
I'll remember if you say

call in the night boy
call in
call in the night boy
call in

(Instrumental)

Here I stand left behind
My eyes are open wide
If you need me you should try
calling the night boy
call in
call in the night boy
call in
call in the night boy,
calling the night boy,
calling the night boy,
call in
call in the night boy
call in
