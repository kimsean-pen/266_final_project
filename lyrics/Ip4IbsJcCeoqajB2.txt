Justice brennan,
Take out some insurance on me, baby baby.
It's just the I'm busted and dripping,
My sorry lungs are all leaking,
It's all over, it's all over i said,
The last fair deal going down.
You let your gown to the ground,
But I'm not waiting around until the kiss-off.
Wasn't it you who said yeah you can shoot me lightly,
But ask me to be excused, I won't go die politely
Anytime that you want you can shoot me lightly,
But ask me to be excused, I won't go die politely.
Justice brennan, I know it's not your fault,
no baby no baby.
It's just that you're busted and dripping,
Your sorry lungs are all leaking,
It's not over, it's not over, I said.
Here comes the kiss-off.
