And when I go away
I know my heart can stay with my love
It's understood
It's in the hands of my love
and my love does it good
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
My love does it good
And when the cupboard's bare
I'll still find something there
with my love
it's understood
it's everywhere with my love
and my love does it good
whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa
my love does it good
whoa whoa I love
whoa whoa my love
only my love holds the other key to me
whoa whoa I love
whoa whoa my love
only my love does it good
to me
Don't ever ask me why
I never say goodbye to my love
it's understood
it's everywhere with my love
and my love does it good
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
my love does it good
whoa whoa I love
whoa whoa my love
only my love does it good
to me
whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa
