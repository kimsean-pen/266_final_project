Well, now I found myself,
wish I was someone else.
My hands are stained with love,
wish I could take it away.

I hid behind the shell,
in time the pain will melt.
My heart is stained with love,
wish I could fake it.

I gave my life away,
there's nothing left to say.
I gave my life away,
you take it in your way.

You take it in your way.

My selfish enemy
still has the best of me.
Empty and feeling numb,
wish I could take it away.

I cant control the need,
too weak to not concede.
Wish I was deaf and dumb,
wish I could fake it.

I gave my life away,
there's nothing left to say.
I gave my life away,
you take it in your way.

I gave my life away,
there's nothing left to say.
I gave my life away,
you take it in your way.

I can't pretend we're the same.
I can't pretend we're the same.
I can't pretend we're the same.

Well, now I found myself,
wish I was someone else.
My hands are stained with love,
wish I could fake!

I gave my life away,
there's nothing left to say.
I gave my life away,
you take it in your way.

I gave my life away,
there's nothing left to say.
I gave my life away,
you take it in your way.

You take it in your way.
You take it in your way.
You take it in your way.
You take it in your way.
