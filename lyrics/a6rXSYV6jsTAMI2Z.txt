I feel it in my bones
It weighs like a million stones
The cold harsh truth left me alone

A graceful evening is waiting for me
Though I can't hel but feel anxiety
Obscure and somber but razor sharp
When will this darkened destiny hit me

I long for untroubled days gone by
I long for mother's hope
But still my desperate thundering heart
But all that's left for me now is

Time

I feel it in my bones
It weighs like a million stones
The cold harsh truth left me

My chances stumble from slim to none
I am in shackles my web has been spun
There's nowhere left for me now to run
I dare you darkness come and find me

I long for passionate days gone by
I long for mother's warmth
Have mercy on my thundering heart
All that is left for me now is

Time

Face down silent I fade away
Is there hope for me, I pray
God help me o know I have done wrong in the past
Bless me help me save myself
Be kind

I'm down and out and my days are done
Though in this moment my mind is still free
I should go back to the way it all began
And let the light shine again throught me

I long for fortunate days gone by
I long for mother's hope
Be still my desperate thundering heart
But all that's left for me now is

Time
