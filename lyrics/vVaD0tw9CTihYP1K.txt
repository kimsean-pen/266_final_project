(jett-laguna-cordell)

I was caught so unaware
When you made other plans
Promises you swore to keep
Where more than you could stand

You don't know what you've got
You don't know what you've got
You don't know what you've got
Till it's gone

I can't stand to hear your name
'cause you were so unkind
And though you think you made out well
Someday you will find

You don't know what you've got
You don't know what you've got
You don't know what you've got
Till it's gone

Shame on you, I gave you love
I gave you love so true
But you ran away
So you just don't know what cha' blew
Yeah, yeah

You don't know what you've got
Oh baby
You don't know what you've got
I thought I knew you
You don't know what you've got
Till it's gone

You don't know what you've got
You don't know what you've got
You don't know what you've got
Till it's gone

I was weak when you were there
And I felt so protected
But I'll make sure that you regret
The one that you rejected

You don't know what you've got
You don't know what you've got
You don't know what you've got
Till it's gone

Oh baby
You really blew it
Oh baby
I thought you knew me
Oh baby
Oh baby. . .
