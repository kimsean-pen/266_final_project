I see you stuck in here
And you will fall apart
The maggots eat your hopes, if any
Can you feel sadness come?
Beyond a fear unknown
Is love as strong as death?

I'm gonna take you away
Out from this world
Into the darkside
Where we live

I'm gonna take you away
Out from this world
Into the darkside
For a while

But in the end, we will burn
Sign your name
I'll tell my dreams in return
Some day we're gone
Filled up with ghosts

We're haunted by the past
Dark prodigies of gloom
We're never meant to last, forever
If I could save our minds
Wake up those mirror eyes
Would I accept our fates?

I'm gonna take you away
Out from this world
Into the darkside
Where we live

I'm gonna take you away
Out from this world
Into the darkside
For a while

But in the end we will burn
Sign your name
I'll tell my dreams in return
Some day we're gone
Filled up with ghosts

We were creeping like reptiles
As our birds crossed worlds
You say death is your dark love
And you will die too
In this world

From this world
We will die
We will burn
We will die
In the end we'll burn

Sign your name
I'll tell my dreams in return
Some day we're gone
Filled up with ghosts

In the end we'll burn
Sign your name
I'll tell my dreams in return
Some day we're gone
Filled up with ghosts
