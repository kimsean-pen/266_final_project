Your warm whispers
Out of the dark they carry my heart
Your warm whispers
Into the dawn they carry me through
And I'm weeping warm honey and milk
That you stay surrounding me, surrounding me

Your warm whispers
Letting me drown in a pool of you
Your warm whispers
Keeping the noise from breaking through
And I'm weeping warm honey and milk
That you stay surrounding me, surrounding me
Yeah I'm weeping warm honey and milk
That you stay surrounding me

Your warm whispers
Your warm whispers
Yeah I'm weeping warm honey and milk
Your warm whispers
Yeah I'm weeping warm honey and milk
Your warm whispers

Your warm whispers
Your warm whispers
