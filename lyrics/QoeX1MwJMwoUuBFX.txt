Pretty sure I'm maniacal, but what do I know?
I don't know, all I know is what I see through my monocle
That and the telescope, keep one lens on the money flow
The other's gold and complemental trusty, well, well

I'm rollin' down hills in a suit through the mud
Throw my dress shoes in a fire with the woods
Sit back and relax with the fumes of
Everything I hate in the world
Play Mozart, smoke, my cigar on
My estate, keep the cars parked on the front lawn
Neighbors hate, place duct tape underneath their tires
And I wait

Sun sets to blood moon horizons
Left brain and right brain divided
Set frames and watch plays inside them
In the mountains now's where you'll find him
I smell a breeze in the morning
I feel your presence, it's warming
I paid attention to warnings
But we were too caught up in, transforming

Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floatin' like Aladdin
Them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floatin' like Aladdin
Them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floatin' like Aladdin
Them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floatin' like Aladdin
Them the ones you talkin' to

Lucky days, I'm burnin' the four-sil
Your boy is dusty like brush up a fossil
Hear that shit urk like the noise of a possum
Bitch, I'm a king, I was born in the castle
Built like a boxer, I'm ready to tussle
Fuck on my baby, I'm ready to bust one
Come fuck with me and my dogs
Hate on my ass like in-laws, uh
That boy stay light like a cheerleader, um
She want me filled like a two litre, um
Eat it all day, watch it ricochet off
Then I skrrt off on that Michelin, aw
They don't got nothing on me till I pop
They don't got nothing on me, call the cops
I hit that run like a Heisman boy, run it back
Look at that boy, hit that runnin' back

Shout out to South Central, San Marcos
I got addicted to soft shell tacos
Right now, it's panties and ramen noodles
Now I see how I'm gon' make a shooter
Stamina, stamina!
I used to be holdin' the camera
Head through the glass, throw your window up
Start prayin' to me like my handle Cortana
We like Wu-Tang but I feel like Santana
She's lightskin just like she Hannah Montana
Head was clean, Tony Fantano
Made her my wife-a
She can't eat 'cause she's so Bella
Confused erection
Bad hoes, no name, brand slave, brainless

Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floatin' like Aladdin
Them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floatin' like Aladdin
Them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floatin' like Aladdin
Them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floatin' like Aladdin
Them the ones you talkin' to
