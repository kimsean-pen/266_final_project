Gotta do right, cha gotta do right, ah sometimes

Talkin' 'bout a revolution
Or maybe just a change of mind
Working on my constitution
I began to realize

I've been doin' wrong forever
Trouble was my favorite game, yeah
Breakin' hearts I thought was so clever
But, I'm the one who got hurt playin'

I never could see it comin', no
Never could feel it 'til it's come and gone
But all of that don't mean nothin', no
When you're all alone, oh

Sometimes you gotta do right to be happy
One time you gotta believe in what you feel inside
Sometimes you gotta do right to find happiness, yeah
Sometimes, sometimes

Gotta do right, cha gotta do right, ah sometimes

You're lookin' at a transformation
That's brought about a change in me
Love's a brand new situation
Never have I felt so free

'Cause I can see it comin', yeah yeah
And I can feel it callin' louder now
Lovin' is so rewarding, yeah
When you let it out

Sometimes you gotta do right to be happy
One time you gotta believe in what you feel inside
Sometimes you gotta do right to find happiness, yeah
Sometimes, sometimes

Sometimes you gotta do right to be happy
One time you gotta believe in what you feel inside
Sometimes you gotta do right to find happiness, oh yeah
Sometimes, sometimes, oh

Gotta do right, cha gotta do right, ah sometimes, sometimes
Gotta do right, cha gotta do right, ah sometimes, sometimes
Gotta do right, cha gotta do right, ah sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, oh

Sometimes you gotta do right to be happy
One time you gotta believe in what you feel inside
Sometimes you gotta do right to find happiness, yeah
Sometimes, sometimes

Sometimes you gotta do right to be happy
(Gotta do right, cha gotta do right, ah sometimes, sometimes)
One time you gotta believe in what you feel inside
(Gotta do right, cha gotta do right, ah sometimes, sometimes)
Sometimes you gotta do right to find happiness, oh yeah
(Gotta do right, cha gotta do right, ah sometimes, sometimes)
Sometimes, sometimes, oh

Gotta do right, cha gotta do right, ah sometimes, sometimes
Gotta do right, cha gotta do right, ah sometimes, sometimes
Gotta do right, cha gotta do right, ah sometimes, sometimes
Gotta do right, cha gotta do right, ah sometimes, sometimes
