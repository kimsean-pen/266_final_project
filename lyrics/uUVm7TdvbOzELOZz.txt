Trapped in a Lizard State

I don't care about sunny days
Gonna keep me out of sight right under the shade
Gonna keep me out of sight right under the shade
It's gonna be like this and that's alright if that's ok
Is that ok?
Myself repeats these lines in my head I'm dead
Tired of the shit you caused, fucking bitch
You don't know when to stop
You're a bunch of fat bitches, motherfucking fat bitches

I don't want to be trapped in the black of your heart
And I'm going to fuck things over 'cause that's a start
Well, if I can't have her, then no one can

But baby what am I to do?
I've given up on loving you
I know it's not nothing new
So please do what I ask you to
And please do what I want of you
It's just not fair, baby blue, girl it's true
One day I'm gonna have you
But for now I don't care
I still feel the pain
Of you not loving me the same

There was not much that I could do
Not much that I could do
(Trapped in a Lizard state)
Well I got you on my back
But I'm not gonna crack like you cracked
You're a fucking pussy boy woah woah
Slipping up on my humble pie
You got no legs to keep anywhere near my height
So don't try and get near my height
Don't try keeping me out of the way
I wanna see what you got to say
I wanna hear what you got to say
If that's ok, if that's not ok
Well what's ok?

I don't want to be trapped in the black of your heart
And now I'm gonna make it clear and girl I'll tear you apart
From the inside to the out

Baby what am I to do?
I've given up on loving you
I know it's not nothing new
So please do what I ask you to
And please do what I want of you
It's just not fair, baby blue, and girl it's true
One day I'm gonna have you
But for now I don't care
I still feel the pain
Of you not loving me the same

But girl what was I supposed to do?
Yeah I was so hung up on loving you
And girl believe me this is something new
'Cause all I will do
Is girl whatever I have to do
They all knifed me in the back and girl I can't believe
It's slipping away like that
