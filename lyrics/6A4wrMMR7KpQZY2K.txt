[verse 1]
I see you coming through the door
Creepin'
It's a quarter past four
And
I smell the scent of cheap perfume
Who is she?
You step in the room
With a guilty look upon your face
Busted
And you started to say
but really baby I can explain
Save your breath
I've got something to say

[chorus:]
Every word you say is
Lies, lies, lies
And now I'm leaving you, so
Bye, bye, bye
And I can't take no more of this
Cry, cry, cryin'
You know that you ain't @#%$
With your
Lies, lies, lies
Ohhhhh

[verse 2]
Don't bother to apologize
It's too late
I've heard it all before
And
This should come as no surprise
I'm leaving
I've packed my things
Cause I'm through with this merry go around
I'm getting off
I've finally found
My strength waiting down
I should have left your @#%$
After the first round
Ohhhh

[chorus:]
Every word you say is
Lies, lies, lies
And now I'm leaving you, so
Bye, bye, bye
And I can't take no more of this
Cry, cry, cryin'
You know that you ain't @#%$
With your
Lies, lies, lies

Please, please
Oh please
[laughs]
Yeah
What you goin' do?
Tell your boys
All how you got over again?
Yeah right
Get off your knees
Oh, baby, please
Go ahead and tell the truth
Yeah
You know what
You see this fire in my eyes
It's all because of you
All you do is lie

[chorus:]
Every word you say is
Lies, lies, lies (goodbye, yeah. whooo)
And now I'm leaving you, so
Bye, bye, bye (leaving you, leaving you, ohhh)
And I can't take no more of this
Cry, cry, cryin' (too many tears over the years)
You know that you ain't @#%$
With your
Lies, lies, lies (every little word you say is driving me crazy, insane)

Every word you say is (why lie?)
Lies, lies, lies
And now I'm leaving you, so (bye, bye)
Bye, bye, bye
And I can't take no more of this
Cry, cry, cryin'
You know that you ain't @#%$
With your
Lies, lies, lies (you ain't @#%$ with your li, li, li, li, lies)

[revamp:]
Li, li, lies, lies
Whooo
Lies
Li, li, lies, lies
Lies
Li, li, lies, lies
Lies
Li, li, lies, lies
Lies

Lies

Lies
Bye, bye
Lies
Bye, bye
Lies
Bye, bye
Lies
Bye, bye

Lies
