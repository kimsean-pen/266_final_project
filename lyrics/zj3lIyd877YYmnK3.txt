They can put waste to civilization space
Cos the human species you can stop
See the end, it's got nothing to protect
Now it's too late.

Invaded by millions
Millions and millions.

I see them everywhere
Now they are walking thru my head
My brain is all over.

Their food is plastic clothes and boots.

Flesh and bones
You head.

I would like a monster
Mechanical creatures
Fire is their fear
But you must burn the whole city.

Tomorrow they are gonna lead
Machines keep running.

To the limits of the country.

There is only one solution
Invade one by one.
