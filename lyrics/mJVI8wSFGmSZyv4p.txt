Hey, so when the morning comes
And the night, you kissed me from [?]
Now you take your time to make me shine
Want to go, but remind me to say to you

Without you, I wouldn't care at all
Whatever I do, hope you remember
Without you, I wouldn't care at all
Love you [?]

Without you, I wouldn't care at all
Whatever I do, hope you remember
Without you, I wouldn't care at all
Love you [?]
