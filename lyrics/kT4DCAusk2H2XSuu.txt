Oh yeah

Who are you, the sex police?
My sexting got no rules
Got a million options next to me, yeah
Let me do what I do

And I call it new love, new love, new love
And I call it new love, new love, new love
And I call it new love, new love, new love
New-ew-ew-ew love

Don't say it's the wrong thing
'Cause it don't feel like the wrong thing (Oh yeah)
I stay on my own thing
Then I be in a long thing

And I call it new love
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

I want all of you all over me
In any dark room, ooh, ooh
And I don't wanna know your name (No)
Just let me do what I do, ooh yeah, baby (Oh)

And I call it new love (New love), new love (New love), new love
And I call it new love (New love), new love (New love), new love (New love)
And I call it new love (New love), new love (New love), new love (New love)
New-ew-ew-ew love

Don't say it's the wrong thing (Don't say it's the wrong thing)
'Cause it don't feel like the wrong thing (Don't feel like the wrong thing, oh yeah)
I stay on my own thing (I stay on my own thing)
Then I be in a long thing (Eh, eh, eh)

It's only love, it ain't official
No expectations, only here and now
Baby, we're in this thing together
You and I don't feel like the wrong thing (Oh yeah)

Don't say it's the wrong thing (Don't say it's the wrong thing)
'Cause it don't feel like the wrong thing (Don't feel like the wrong thing)
I stay on my own thing (I stay on my own thing)
Then I be in a long thing (And I be in a long thing)

And I call it new love, new love, new love (New love)
And I call it new love, new love, new love (New love)
And I call it new love, new love, new love (New love)
'Cause it don't feel like the wrong thing (Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah)
