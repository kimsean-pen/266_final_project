Your silver skin
That crawls in rhythm, sweats like spring
Returns me to the deathwish

And all my epiphonies
That branded me and broke my knees
Confirms me into the deathwish

Misfits for free
A gravity pure expression tears and
Pulls them into the deathwish

And all our accessories
That concentrate the pain and tease
Embrace them, with the deathwish

Are we pretending?
Are we pretending?
Are we pretending?
I like pretending

Are we machines
Obsolete, alone
With symbiotic self indulgence
And if we dig deep
The circuitry burnt out, bends
Into neurotic repetition

But your silver skin soothes my aching curses
And reminds me
That you're worth it

The whole world's insanities
The bleeding hearts and tragedies
Won't distract me from the deathwish

Are we pretending?
Are we pretending?
Are we pretending?
I like pretending

Are we pretending?
Are we pretending?
Are we pretending?
'Cos I like pretending
