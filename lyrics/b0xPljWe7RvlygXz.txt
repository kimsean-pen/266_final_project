I'm sipping pink
Lucozade
We're blazing on that new found haze
I'm seeing in the blacks and grays
Oh, hoping that the basket sways
Left to right, sit and talk shit all night
Does that make it right for smoke
Maybe, or am I just seeing shit?

Seeing the pain side in this house of fear

You don't even wanna know about the things I hear
Quick fix, headlines shine bright, you're the fuckin' deal
I'm just switching [?]
In your position
You'll be fishing for far too long

You're the bad guy in this movie
And I ain't wrong, I don't breathe the pollution

And the only solution is making shit confusing
And it ain't about whose winning or losing

It's bout the path your choosing
Time heals pain and promotes self-soothing
When the scares are gone you can't see bruising
Wanna take these watches, chains and gold rings

I'm getting caught up in the feelings that they bring
A lack of sanity, losing touch with reality
Smoking too much, it's starting to fog up my clarity
Traveling in the day but you're still looking far to me

Bulls eye you the dot to me
Emotions splattered [?]

Can't even begin to spot 'em
I'm sad about shit that never happened
No lies in my eyes, nothing but truth will lay in my mouth
I'm tryna fuckin scream but the words won't come out
Oh, tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out

She's older, I told her
We ain't meant to be
It takes two not three, but I'm here any way
I hope he's leaving soon
Started not to see the elephant in this room
Disguises your perfume
But the smell of it consumes, it takes all my mind
You can search the world but you will never find
I see everything you've done to me
Be there, you run me
I don't need to pace, I don't need the stamina

If this shit was it, girl, I probably would be rammin' ya
Kept running
Outwit, cause you gunnin'
That outfit cause you stunnin'
Begging cause I'm losing man
Got me feeling some type of way I can't explain
The fuck is going on?
I think I got it wrong
When I told you I was over, or were you under me?
