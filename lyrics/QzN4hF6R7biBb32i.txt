Get twisted Sundays look
I ain't gon' wait till the beat drops
Imma get it while it's warming start to form this heat rock

I spit classics complex progressions, my whole flow is bebop
I bless demographics with lessons 'cause my bars are sheetrock
That's hard, these scars gon' get me to the treetop
I'm different now but I used to keep my eye on tail like peacocks
Changed my perspective
Got selective on what line I eavesdropped
Switched to the main one then refrained
From all the dames that P-popped
They were thotties, used to smash them as hobbies
But I'm Godly, no prob'ly, I bring Yeshua to the hood
Mamma Nita met Fat she said yes He blessing you good
My cousin whole life a mess cause he stay obsessed with the jugg
I try to confess I'm blessed even when my life as dark as Suge's
Last name, that's knight; don't get it? You prolly snoozing
I make it clearest, my dearest, whenever the spirit moving
I'm tryna spark a reunion, bring back all the real rappers
Donald Trump won the president, preacher say that the rapture
Is coming; so we on our knees praying to get acceptance
If we made it in his image then why can't I see reflections of love
They project us as thugs, hell, my partners need hugs
We straight outta the mud, I told my pops I'm the plug
For purpose, passion, talent, skills, and everything that's above
Hell the poverty line if I ain't the best then they probably lying
The flow touch souls boy it's probably divine
Whole wrist gold but I hardly got time
For Facebook post that are partly designed
To place fake hope in the partially blind
And I told Ms.Rogers she oughta be mine
And we start dating practice abstinence to dodge Satan
I'm cool with waiting but swear it took revelations
And Genesis, matter fact, awhole Biblical compilation
The defense of Gary Payton and hella spiritual patrons to help me
Cause I was tryna GTD like Tommy on season 2
Prolly episode 16 of Martin, man, RIP Tommy Ford
But please check that episode
Just to see how much more I put into every score I pen
I scrub the floor with men
Who say they rap but really industry whores within
I'm done, bring the chorus back in
But ain't no chorus though
Yeah, but ain't no chorus though

Ouu, you know that boy so fye
Ouu, you know that
Ouu, you know that
But ain't no chorus though
Ouu, you know that boy so fye
Ouu, you know that
Ouu, you know that
Ouu, but ain't no chorus though
Ouu, you know that boy so fye
Naw, scratch that, we about to put a chorus right here
Look

This is the chorus for the haters that be big mad
Who throw us Juju but we doo-doo on that witchcraft
We black as the Zulu with moves you do at the kickbacks
Shoutout to those of you who knew we'd get the big bag
Say it! This is the chorus for the haters that be big mad
Who throw us Juju but we doo-doo on that witchcraft
We black as the Zulu with moves you do at the kickbacks
Shoutout to those of you who knew we'd get the big bag
Ouu, you know that boy so fye
Shoutout to those of you who knew we'd get the big bag
Ouu, you know that boy so fye
Shoutout to those of you who knew we'd get the big bag
