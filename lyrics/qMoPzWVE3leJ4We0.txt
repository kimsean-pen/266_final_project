Now let my beat control your body!

Let my beat
Let my beat

Control your body
The beat is runnin' through your veins
Control your body
When you let it penetrate your brain

The booming system which plays in places
Move your system, change these spaces
When I'm on the mic you can't refuse
No I didn't came to preach, I came to amuse
Techno making, no mistakin', never faking
Always breaking it down, Ha to a party
Now let my beat control your body!

Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Now let my beat control your body

Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body

Let my beat
Let my beat

Control your body
The beat is runnin' through your veins
Control your body
When you let it penetrate your brain

It's my beat now
It's my beat

Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body

Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body, Yeah...

Let my beat
Let my beat

Down with the forces how we go
Second to first just you to show
You can't stand still 'cause you gotta move
You feel the bass line you feel the groove
My beat accepts you just as you are
It drives you away just like a fast car
It's my beat, it belongs to me
So let my beat control your body!

Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body!

Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body

Now let my beat control your body!

Control your body
The beat is runnin' through your veins
Control your body
When you let it penetrate your brain

Let the beat control your body!
