Your time is up!
We've been counting down your days
Going over every false thing you say

We wish it could be different
We wished you stayed the same
Tearing down our idols--living life our own way
Taking the chance to say

All my heroes are dead
All my heroes are dead

Were we to blind to see you were only human like me?
But we can't help or feel
Empty words: they're all you gave
Struggling to take back our days

They build you up watch you fall
They build you up watch you fall
Can't you see it can't be what you want
Because I love to watch them fall

Where did we lose control we thought it last forever
Where did we lose control we thought it last forever
We thought it'd last forever
We thought it'd last forever

Were counting down away your days
Our heroes, the ones they use to be
Our idols fall!
Our heroes, the ones they use to be
Our idols fall away!
