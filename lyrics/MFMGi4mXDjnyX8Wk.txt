Soon you're bleeding
But I can't stop
This love
From leaving
So I mop it up.

You find your skin on my hands,
And I find our passion gone.
You ask for more time,
And I ask myself again
Where did I go wrong?

So I cry at films
That show me a good life,
That show where I want to be,
That show where we should be now,
I don't know,
Where did I go wrong?

How to change a heartbeat
Is so much easier said than done.
One souvenir of how we were
And I'm overcome.

You find me left in pieces
And I find our passion gone.
You ask for more time,
And I ask myself again
Where did I go wrong?

I try to think of words to say but
You never hear them,
You never talk about it.

Look how this heart slips away,
Oh, you never notice,
You never think about it.
Don't ask for more time,
Just ask yourself
Where did I go wrong?
