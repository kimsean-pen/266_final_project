I love you Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ I love you
Yes I do
I love you Jesus Christ

Jesus Christ I love you
Yes I do
And on the lazy days

The dogs dissolve and drain away
The world it goes
And always waits
The day we are awaiting
Up and over we go through the wave and undertow

I will float until I learn how to swim
inside my mother in a garbage bin
until I find myself again again
Up and over we go mouths open wide and spitting still
And I will spit until I learn how to speak
up thru the dorway as the sideboards creek
with them ever proclaiming me me
Up and over we go the weight it sits on down and I don't know
I will shout until they know what I mean
I mean the marriage of a dead dog sing
and a synthetic flying machine, machine ohh ohh ohh ohh
ohh ohh ohh ohh
(okay)
