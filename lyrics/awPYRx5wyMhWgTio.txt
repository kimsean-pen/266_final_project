Won't you find this little heart of mine
I buried it deep inside
Next to my lazy eye

Oh won't you be
(Hey!)
Oh won't you be

In my life, talking 'bout all the time
Everything feels so right
You're such a friend of mine

Oh won't you be
Standing next to me
Yeah, won't you find
This little heart of mine

There's a fire across the bay
My mind was made of

There's a fire across the bay
My mind was made of

So won't you be
Standing next to me
Yeah, won't you find
This little heart of mine
