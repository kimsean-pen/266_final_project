We've been patient
Out here waiting
How long does it take to reach someone
We've been saving
Our frustrations
Pennies on the dollar we've given
But we can't wait any longer

So we're banging the door
And we're pleading for more
Cause we hope
Everything'll change
Everything'll change
No we don't have a key
But we're not gonna leave
Cause we hope
Everything'll change
Everything'll change

Someday soon

Hands are shaking
Legs are failing
Will this building ever feel like home
Time is faded
Seconds wasted

Trying to squeeze the water from a stone
But we can't wait any longer

So we're banging the door
And we're pleading for more
Cause we hope
Everything'll change
Everything'll change
No we don't have a key
But we're not gonna leave
Cause we hope

Everything'll change
Everything'll change
Someday soon

Everything'll change
Everything'll change
Everything'll change
Everything'll change
Everything'll change
Everything'll change
Everything'll change
Everything'll change
Everything'll change
Everything'll change

So we're banging the door
And we're pleading for more
Cause we hope
Everything'll change
Everything'll change
No we don't have a key
But we're not gonna leave
Cause we hope
Everything'll change
Everything'll change
Someday soon
