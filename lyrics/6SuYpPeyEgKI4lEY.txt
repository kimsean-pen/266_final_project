Come and see
Where I witness everything
On my knees
Beat it down to get to my soul
Against my will
Anyone can tell it's you coming
Baby don't mind
Leave it on the line, leave it hanging on the rail

Come and ride away
It's easier to stick to the old
Surrounded by the night
Surrounded by the night and you don't know where
But you abuse my faith
Lose it every time, but I don't know where
You're on my side again
So, ride the heat wherever it goes
I'll be the one to care

You're all I've got, wait
The road is a dark line catching my side
Well, you can see it through the darkness coming my way
Well, we won't get lost inside it all again

On my right
No one sees me when I'm out here waiting
They don't mind that I'm here, I hear
For the best way, oh, you're mine against it
I won't keep you here, but I can

Oh, I'll talk to you when I make my way back
I don't see it anywhere I go, babe, yeah

Lost on my sea again
The easy way to cover my sin
Don't want another dark time to think to myself
We won't get lost inside it all, you're on my way
Well, I can see it in the darkness combing my mind
Well, we hear the voices war inside
And you wont get lost inside it all
You're on my way
