She's cutting out the bruises
Forgetting her excuses for being here again
With a suitcase packed and waiting by the door
In her head
Convinced herself she hasn't lost
Enough to quit

But tonight she lays here thinking
What if I just left
In the middle of the night
Back to California
And never look back

She'll fantasize about it
Every single day but she can't find it
In her heart to run away
And no one's listening
With Northern Massachusetts
On his knees to stay
He's begging
"Please, oh baby please, I can explain
It won't happen again"

He's putting out the fires
And he's making her believe
He's really changed
This time
But it's obvious it's just another line
Lapse and relapse

And again she lays behind him thinking:
I'll pretend in the middle of the night
My eyes are closed I'm sleeping
But I won't come back

She'll fantasize about it
Every single day but she can't find it
In her heart to run away
And no one's listening
With Northern Massachusetts
On his knees to stay
He's begging
"Please, oh baby please, I can explain
It won't happen again
It won't happen again"

How long can this last?
The final straw was the hospital
At least she told herself that
But she just can't find the strength to end it!

I just left
In the middle of the night
Back to California
I'll never look back

She'll fantasize about it
Every single day but she can't find it
In her heart to run away (To run away)
With Northern Massachusetts
On his knees to stay
He's begging
"Please, oh baby please, I can explain
It won't happen again
It won't happen again!"
