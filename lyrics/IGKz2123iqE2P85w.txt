I go out of my mind
Thinking 'bout what I used to be
I got a picture in my head
But it's not what I like to see
And then this big black
Cloud came down to smother me
I was left with no choice
But to care about company

So tell me what you want
Tell me want you want
Why have you come for me?
(Why have you come for me?)
'Cause I was fine before
You came to my door
I never should've let you stay

Mother, can you help me?
I've been locked up, can't escape it
Have I done wrong? Am I guilty?
Why do I feel like, I'm suffocating?
Oh, what does he want from me?
Said, "I don't know?" but he won't leave
So I guess I got bad company?

Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh

I've been lying in my bed
But I haven't slept a wink
When I try to close my eyes
Yeah, my mind, it just overthinks

So tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Is this just fun for you?
(Is this just fun for you?)
'Cause I know that it's not
I know that it's not
Because I am you

Mother, can you help me?
I've been locked up, can't escape it
Have I done wrong? Am I guilty?
Why do I feel like, I'm suffocating?
Oh, what does he want from me?
Said, "I don't know?" but he won't leave
So I guess I got bad company?

'Cause I'm trying to scream
It feels like a dream
No sound comes out, no one's to be seen
But I know I'm not alone
Yeah, I know I'm not alone
And you talk to me with your violent tongue
But I won't react 'cause I'll look psycho
This can't keep going on
No, this can't keep going on

Mother, can you help me?
I've been locked up, can't escape it
Have I done wrong? Am I guilty?
Why do I feel like, I'm suffocating?

Mother, can you help me?

Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh
(Got bad company)
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh
(Got bad company)
Oh-woah-oh
