Put your face to the microphone
Shout out a lil' louder
Gon' get this whole world in a note

Moved on with the medicine
Gon' tap our little back in something
You follow the moons, must stop and ...

Uh uh uh,
Uh uh uh,

Pleasure worth a bonus man
But you turn me sweet and sower
Now these flowers are scratching over more
Yes please give me another treat
Who beats, what you got no one
Your cookies screaming that are ...

Uh uh uh,
Uh uh uh,

Oh-oh
You brought your rocket ship into the empty pit in my heart
And now I'm falling in love
Oh-oh yeah
I want your rocket ship into the empty pit in my heart
I'm all full up with your love

Never been in magazines, ain't seen me on the TV
But you pin me like a poster to the wall
I sure like what you get in there
Just don't tell me where you learned that
Voodoo your guru touch you well

Uh uh uh,
Uh uh uh,

A pleasure or a punishment
Send me your messed up message
Just say the part, and I'll play the role
As soft as cotton candy, suddenly you should've chained me
And always keep it corporal

Uh uh uh,
Uh uh uh,

Oh-oh
You brought your rocket ship into the empty pit in my heart
And now I'm falling in love
Oh-oh yeah
I want your rocket ship into the empty pit in my heart
I'm all full up with your love

Never been in magazines, ain't seen me on the TV
But you pin me like a poster to the wall
I sure like what you get in there
Just don't tell me where you learned that
Voodoo your guru touch you well

And now I'm falling in love
