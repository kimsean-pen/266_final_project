I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come

They got some crazy
Little women there
And I'm gonna get me one.

I'm gonna be
Standing on the corner
Twelfth Street and Vine
I'll be standing on the corner

Twelfth Street and Vine
With my Kansas City baby
And a bottle of Kansas City wine

Well, I might take a train
I might take a plane

But if I have to walk
I'm going just the same
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come

They got some crazy
Little women there
And I'm gonna get me one
Now if I stay with that woman
I know I'm gonna die

Gotta find a brand new baby
And that's the reason why
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come
They got some crazy
Little women there
And I'm gonna get me one
They got some crazy
Little women there
And I'm gonna get me one
They got some crazy
Little women there
And I'm gonna get me one
