We shall walk again
All along the lane
Down the avenue
Just like we used to do

With our heads so high
Smile at the passers by
And we'll softly sigh
Ay, ay, ay

Everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone

By the winding stream
We shall lie and dream
We'll make dreams come true
If we want them to

Yes, all will come
Play the pipes and drum
Sing a happy song
And we'll sing along

Everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone

We shall walk again
All along down the lane
Down the avenue
Just like we used to do

With our heads so high
Smile at passers by
And we'll softly sigh
Ay, ay, ay

Everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone
