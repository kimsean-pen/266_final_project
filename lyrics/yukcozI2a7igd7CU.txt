My girl, my girl, tell me why you look so sad...
Has the sun finally set on us?
Have you come to long for another's hand?
There's just a feeling inside me that something's leaving,
Life someone stealing salt from sea,
Let me sinking and left me thinking
How to keep you caged with me

Because I need you like air to breathe
Just to hold you,
O' I hold you
O' how I hold you,
I hold you down.

Down with my insecurities,
Down with my hypocrisy,
Down with my pathetic pleas,
Down instead of setting you free
To find your happiness with or without me.

So untie your feet, reattach your wings,
So you don't have to open your throat to sing

Because it's you I love, then from you...

I'd walk away.

And your face:
On every leaf
Of every branch
Of every tree.
