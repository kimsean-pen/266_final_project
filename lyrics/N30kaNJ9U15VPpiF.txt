I cried when I heard you were cheating
I cried when I said I was leaving
I cried when my heart stopped believing
But I'm all out of tears

Then I feel so weak but I know I'm strong
So I wipe my face and I just move on
My eyes are red, my cheeks are dry
Singing my last goodbye

I cut off my hair
And I painted my toes
I sold all the diamonds
And burnt all your clothes

I ain't never gonna cry again
I ain't never gonna cry again
I ain't never gonna cry again, no
Unless they're happy tears

Unless they're happy tears

I bet you've been trying to call me
I blocked all your numbers so you couldn't phone
Don't want to hear "baby, I'm sorry"
You don't get to apologize

'Cause I'm not weak, I know I'm strong
You hurt me once
Your chance has gone
Our love is dead but I am still alive
Singing my last goodbye

I cut off my hair
And I painted my toes
I sold all the diamonds
And burnt all your clothes

I ain't never gonna cry again
I ain't never gonna cry again
I ain't never gonna cry again, no
Unless they're happy tears

I cried when I slashed all your tires
I cried when your suits hit the fire
I cried 'cause I'll never see you again
But those are happy tears

I cut off my hair
And I painted my toes
I sold all the diamonds
And burnt all your clothes

I ain't never gonna cry again
I ain't never gonna cry again
I ain't never gonna cry again
Unless they're happy tears

Unless they're happy tears
Happy tears
