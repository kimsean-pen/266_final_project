The only thing that was in the way
Was not clear, please show
And everything they said we couldn't be
I shed my fear, you know

Go Home
Go Home
Back to where you used to be
Missed Jokes
Shadows
Fill the air
In Between

The city is so bright, you can see
Things have changed, so mad
And everyone you know, can only be
Prearranged, so sad

Go Home
Go Home
Back to where you used to be
Missed Jokes
Shadows
Fill the air
In Between

Today in this world
My voice is gone
Washed away
Returning home
Doesn't feel
All the same

When memories
Are all we have
When all we have
Is in our heads
