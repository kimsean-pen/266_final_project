Renting out your mind
And saving every dime
Because when ten of those combine
They cross a sacred line
And go from pocket change
To a gold mine

She said she'd be down to hangout
With her parents out of town she was hoping I'm around
For a party at her vacant place
I said I'd come; showed up and felt out of place

What's the drive in being alive
When you don't know who you are?
What's the fun in getting drunk
