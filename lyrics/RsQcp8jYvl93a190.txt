I keep biting down
There's a spirit haunting me
Did I scream too loud? Did I scream too loud?
Let me break it down
I feel like it's costing me more than life allows And time is running out

I've already
Already been dragged through it all
Through it all
I've already
Already been dragged through it all
Through it all

You take the love and I'll take the fall
You get the bridge and I get the wall
You take the love and I'll take the fall
You get the bridge and I get the wall

Look before you cross
I think our fate was sealed before we both got lost
Before we both got lost

I've already
Already been dragged through it all
Through it all
I've already
Already been dragged through it all
Through it all

You take the love and I'll take the fall
You get the bridge and I get the wall
You take the love and I'll take the fall
You get the bridge and I get the wall

I've already
Already been dragged through it all
Through it all

You take the love and I'll take the fall
You get the bridge and I get the wall
You take the love and I'll take the fall
You get the bridge and I get the wall
You take the love and I'll take the fall
You get the bridge and I get the wall
