Here comes the darkness
It's eating all my soul
Now that the spark has
Burn out of control
The fire is raging
I can't find the door
I just wanna die here
But you want it more

You want me to burn
Want me to burn
Want me to hurt
And maybe I will finally learn

Here comes the darkness
It's eating all my brain
Now all the lights
Are driving me insane
The fire is blazing
And I'm still inside
I just wanna die here
You won't let me out alive

You want me to burn
Want me to burn
Want me to hurt
And maybe I will finally learn
