And I swear I tried
to kill what's inside
I didn't make it in time
please come take all thats mine
all I want is yours
and how this hurts
alexander, alexander
the streets, the summers, the anonymity
public transports, photobooths and galleries
the zoo, the parks, apartments, the rooftops
architecture, hauptbahnhof, the balconies, the winters, with me
alexander, you are my winter
alexander
alexander, alexander
alexander you are my winter, alexander
And I swear I tried
to kill what's inside
I didn't make it in time
please come take all thats mine
all I want is yours
and how this hurts
alexander, alexander
