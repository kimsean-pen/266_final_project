Oh, you look so tired
Mouth slack and wide
Ill-housed and ill-advised
Your face is as mean
As your life has been

Crash into my arms
I want you
You don't agree
But you don't refuse
I know you

And I know a place
Where no-one is likely to pass
Oh, you don't care if it's late
And you don't care if you're lost
And oh, you look so tired
But tonight you've presumed too much
Too much, too much
And if it's the last thing I ever do
I'm gonna get you

Crash into my arms
I want you
You don't agree
But you don't refuse
I know you

(Only in the studio version):
And no one knows a thing about my life
I can come and go as I please
If I want to I can stay
Or if I want to I can leave
Nobody knows me, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me, nobody knows me
Aah, aah, nobody knows me
Aah, aah, nobody knows me
Aah, aah, nobody knows me
