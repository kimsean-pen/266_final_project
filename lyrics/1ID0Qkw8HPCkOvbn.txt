It's In My Heart; It's In Your Soul,
You Choose To Judge,
Is That Your Role?
Don't Analyse Or Complicate,
You'll Critisise, You Can't Relate...

And Now You Want Some Understanding.
What's My Point Of View?

Then I'll Just Fade Away
When I Hear All Your Lies I Choke
Then I'll Just Fade Away
Suffering From The Times You Spoke I Fade

Regarding More? Just Seems Much Less
So Cynical You Must Confess
I'm Dying Here, Completely Blind
Your Will To Live- Just Dampens Mine,

And Now You Want Some Understanding...
What's My Point Of View?
