I know how it feels to feel alone
The king of my own fears, I never leave the throne
And I've been searching for a place inside my soul
Where all my demons can't find me when I go
"Pull it together," they say
So I keep hoping for better days

I'd be lying if I said that I was fine
Cause I feel pain sometimes that I cannot describe
So do I raise my fist and curse up at the sky
Or do I close my eyes and realize, that's just life?

I know how it feels to lose control
The weight inside myself is not always my own
I am broken, where I'll end up I don't know
But maybe that's the point, so I trust in you alone

I'd be lying if I said that I was fine
Cause I feel pain sometimes that I cannot describe
So do I raise my fist and curse up at the sky
Or do I close my eyes and realize, that's just life?

I'm holding onto hope as I turn the page
And I'm praying there is peace to be found in the pain
Tell me tomorrow won't be the same
And tell me this is just a season

And my story doesn't end this way?
I'd be lying if I said that I was fine
Cause I feel pain sometimes that I cannot describe
So do I raise my fists and curse up at the sky
Or do I close my eyes and realize, that's just life?
That's just life.
