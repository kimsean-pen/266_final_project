This world
is going up in flames
and nobody
wanna take the blame
don't tell me
how to live my life
when you
never felt the pain

ooo ooo ooo

come on babe
they don't hear me cry
they don't hear me
they don't hear me cry
but what I gotta do

I can't turn my head away
Seeing all these things
The world
is burning up in flames
and nobody
wanna take the blame

you oh you
you oh you
me oh me

they don't hear me cry
they don't hear me

it's killing me
oh babe
come on babe

gotta be
a better world
gotta make it babe
gotta make it right

ooh
