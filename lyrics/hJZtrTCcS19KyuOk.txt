How does it taste?
When your mind is all over the place
When will it change?
Cause I see it all over your face

Into the unkown
Come through

I slip up into the flood like a memory
Play out tomorrow
I stare into the above like the energy
Fake out the sorrow

How does it taste?
When you feel so empty in vein
Let's cut the chase
Sometimes thats all it takes

I slip up into the flood like a memory
Play out tomorrow
I stare into the above like the energy
Fake out the sorrow

Feels like a [?]
Im locked in a [?]
[?] Fade out
Calling you out
Calling you out

Into the unknown
Come through

I slip up into the flood like a memory
Play out tomorrow
I stare into the above like the energy
Fake out the sorrow
