the bearer of bad news
is talking to the greeds
floating for some message
hiding in the trees
the wiery voice inside you
is darker in the night
the healing in the morning light

but you're out wasting time
with the right guy
with the right guy

tell the early morning
that i am on my way
send to him my greetings
for happier holidays
spent my open eyes on
the things i left behind
like thirty feet in my hopeful eyes

but you're out wasting time
with the right guy
with the right guy

rich man counts his money
then holds it in the light
folds it in his hands together
and keeps it by his side
counts his every blessing
he dubbed on our heads
and told us to remember them

but you're out wasting time
with the right guy
with the right guy
but you're out wasting time
with the right guy
with the right guy
with the right guy
with the right guy
with the right guy
with the right guy
with the right guy
