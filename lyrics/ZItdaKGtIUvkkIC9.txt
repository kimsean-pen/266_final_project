Broken down before the (?)
It's all in your head
It's all in your head

Hold my hand (hold my hand)
No we won't, we will not find
Leave me through this (through this)

Act as if you barely know me
And leave this carelessness, you're mine
It's all in your head
It's all in your head

Hold my hand (hold my hand)
No we won't, we will not find
Leave me through this (through this)
No we won't, we will not find
Hold my hand (hold my hand)
No we won't, we will not find
Leave me through this (through this)
