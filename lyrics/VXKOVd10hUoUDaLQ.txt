Hey, what's bubbling down under there?
Why's it screaming what's unfair?
Please excuse it, forget and hide.
Let the shelter swell inside.
Hatch it out now, watch it squirm.
It's asking me what's that I've learned.

Stay inside, pull me out of space.
Tread me, sprinkling the grace.
Stay and pave my faith.

Thought I knew you, stuck out my hand.
You bit, wish I could understand.
It's a twisted feeling, staring bored.
It's time to burn the hope I store.
Wait for me there, dash and run.
Still, your righteousness won't be outdone.

Stay inside, pull me out of space.
Tread me, sprinkling the grace.
Stay and pave my faith.

Pave my faith, pave my faith,
Pave my faith, and pave my faith.
