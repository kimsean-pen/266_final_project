Deeper in and deeper still use your hands like eyes
Sift around the bottom row and soon will be your time
Keep your hands by your side,
Hands by your side,
Your hands by your side,
Your hands by your side (soon will be your time)
I've got my hands on it, I've gotta find a way
I've got my hands on it, I've gotta find a way out
I've got my hands on it, I've gotta find a way
I've got my hands on it, I've gotta find a way out
Bring all my people with me
Bring all my people with me
Bring all my people with me
Deeper in and deeper still the belly was the bank
The lion holds the mouth we feed still died at forty-five
Keep your hands by your side,
Hands by your side,
Your hands by your side,
Your hands by your side (soon will be your time)
I've got my hands on it, I've gotta find a way
I've got my hands on it, I've gotta find a way out
I've got my hands on it, I've gotta find a way
I've got my hands on it, I've gotta find a way out
Bring all my people with me
