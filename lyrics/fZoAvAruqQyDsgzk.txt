Matters of life meaning's eye
I'm on hold
Reasonless lie
Matters of life passing by
Feeling's strong
Weakening sight
A limit of perception is the limit to perceive
Awareness could be yours
Glimpse of the unseen
Matters of life
Bemoaning fate
I've reached the pits
My life's at stake
Can we escape world's cutting edge?
Desired fate in reaching the truth
Feeling's strong
Weakening sight
Matters of life passing by
Matters of this world
Matters of this life
Digging thoughts and digging minds
Matters of this world
Matters of this life
I'm down the line
Meaning's eye
