When I stare into your space
I look before you
And I can see you at the times

I'll be around,
to pick up your thought

Save your kaleidoscope girl
In the doorway
Just look to my world at the times

I'll be around,
to pick up your thought

Why should I turn from your face?
I'm looking for you
And I still miss you at times

I'll be around,
to make up your thought
