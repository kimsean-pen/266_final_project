I felt nothing, nothing at all
Everyone we know is bound the same
One day maybe we we'll want the same
But right now they think it might fall away

We're bound to lose
But there's something about you
Still won't move
But there's something about you
Something about you

My companion, over it all
No one could replace what we became
And one day maybe we will find a way
But right now all we have is all we make

We're bound to lose
But there's something about you
Still won't move
But there's something about you
Something about you

I don't mind
They can say we're up and down
They can call it all, a shame
In my life
Even if everything is now
I would have it all the same

We're bound to lose
But there's something about you
Still won't move
But there's something about you
Something about you

There's something about you
There's something about you
There's something about you
(Something about you)
There's something about you
There's something about you
Something about you
You, you; you, you
Something about you
