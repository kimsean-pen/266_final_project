hey-hey-hey-hey
now they put the stink on us
throw us to the sucubus
fed us to the incubus
and brung in the Saprophagus
c'mon and kiss me black
black as the pit in which you found me

she's like a dog you have to kick her
sleeps like a swastica
and says 'everyone's a winner now
cos everyone's a sinner now'
c'mon and kiss me black
c'mon and sail your ships around me
c'mon and kiss me black
black as the sea in which you drowned me
c'mon and kiss me black
run your crusty cutless through me
c'mon and kiss me black
kiss me black and then undo me.
