I'll be your leprechaun
Shamrock a lucky charm
(Whoa yeah)
Tap-dance in olive oil
(It's ok)
Dip into the sugar bowl
(Whoa yeah)

Sunny Side up
Sunny Side up
Such a lovely way to start the day
Sunny Side up
Sunny Side up
Not the only way to fry an egg
Sunny Side up
Sunny Side up

I am just a grain of sand on your beach
With all of my heart
All of my Heart
A drop rain through your hands

Rainbows will bend for me
Curvy
Honey bees will sting for me
Stingy, stingy

Sunny Side up
Sunny Side up
Not the only way to fry an egg
Sunny Side up
Sunny Side up
Dance the night away like Fred Astaire

Come on ride my wave
Ride it all the way
(Sunny side up)
'Til the ocean ends
(Sunny side up)
I'll see you there
(Sunny side up)
