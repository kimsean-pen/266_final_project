I've been working all day for me mate on the site
Running around like a blue arsed fly
I've been working
And I've been working all day for me mate

Every bleeding minute I been on the go
Up and down the ladder like a fiddler's elbow
I've been working
I've been working all day for me mate

Wait for tomorrow at half past ten
When I sign on, but until then
I'll be working
I'll be working all day for me mate

Aint' got no cards, don't pay no tax
For a score in me hand I'll be breaking me back
I'll been working
And I'll been working all day for me mate
Call me a crook, call me bent
But I need more than food and rent
I've been working
And I've been working all day for me mate

Wait for tomorrow at half past ten
When I sign on, but until then
I'll be working
I'll be working all day for me mate

They try to follow me every day
I give 'em the slip and I'm on my way
None of the other blokes thinks it's wrong
'Coz every one of 'em's signing on

They try to follow me every day
I give 'em the slip and I'm on my way
None of the other blokes thinks it's wrong
'Coz every one of 'em's signing on

The benefit boys are out of touch
What they don't know won't hurt 'em much
I've been working
And I've been working all day for me mate

If I'm caught I'll go down for a month or three
But they'll still Be paying out looking after me
I been working
And I been working all day for me mate

Wait for tomorrow at half past ten
When I sign on, but until then
I'll be working
I'll be working all day for me mate
