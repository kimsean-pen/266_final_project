I wanna work less, but I wanna make more
Wanna be king in a cherry Lambo
I wanna go hard, but I wanna lay low, I want it all
I want a boyfriend, but I wanna run free
Wanna be nasty, wanna be sweet
Want the West Coast with the little Wall Street, I want it all
Got debt that I owe, fuck what you know
American dreams aren't cheap
If your God had hope, but still feel low
Baby, you're just like me
So pick up your drink, let's be anything
That we wanna be, yeah, ooh
Hands up like we're free, to be anything
That we wanna be, yeah, ooh
I wanna hop trains, wanna win the lotto
And buy my mama a sick condo
In my Chuck Taylors and my Tom Ford, I want it all
I wanna work less, but I wanna make more
We could be kings in a cherry Lambo
If you wanna hang tight or you wanna let go, we'll have it all
Got debt that we owe, fuck what we know
American dreams aren't cheap
If your God had hope, but still feel low
Baby, you're just like me
So pick up your drink, let's be anything
That we wanna be, yeah, ooh
Hands up like we're free, to be anything
That we wanna be, yeah, ooh
Got debt that I owe, fuck what I now
American dreams aren't cheap
If your God had hope, but still feel low
Baby, you're just like me
So pick up your drink, let's be anything
That we wanna be, yeah, ooh
Hands up like we're free, to be anything
That we wanna be, yeah, ooh
So pick up your drink, let's be anything
That we wanna be, yeah, ooh
Hands up like we're free, to be anything
That we wanna be, yeah, ooh
