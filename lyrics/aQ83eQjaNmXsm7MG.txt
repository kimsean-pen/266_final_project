Last year was one of our better years
in a life full of separation.
Well it's ok to second guess
Just as long as you remember she's gone

In the bright of day
it might seem like the stars are gone.
They never leave.
they come back when the sun moves on.

It's over now
You watched me as I turned around.
It's not why, but how
The light is on
I'll come home.

Now I feel it's been such a long time
since her eyes have met with mine.
I feel it's been such a long time
I'm glad you've made up your mind.

It's hurting me from the inside
If I only had something to say.
Maybe if I prove that I'm right
Will it still be safe to stay?
