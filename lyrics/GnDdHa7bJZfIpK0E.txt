We live in twisted times
Harbored by neglect
Swallowed by distant cries
Of love and regret

So I can grow now

The gavel's banged in time
In the trials of the heart
We are young
We are free
And growth will
Tear us apart

So I can grow now

So I can grow now
But what of the disease?
So I can grow how
Don't you lie to me?
So I can grow now
But what of the disease
So I can grow now

We live in twisted times
Harbored by neglect
Swallowed by distant cries
Of love and regret

So I can grow now

The gavel's banged in time
In the trials of the heart
We are young
We are free
And growth will
Tear us apart

So I can grow now

So I can grow now
But what of the disease?
So I can grow how
Don't you lie to me?
So I can grow now
But what of the disease
So I can grow now
