Oh, yeah

Sometimes I feel like I'm going out of my mind
Boy, the way you do me it's a damn crime
But, then you smile at me and it's all right
With you there ain't no in between
Every time that I walk out the door
Tell myself I won't take it no more
There's a part of me won't let you go
I keep saying yes but my mind's sayin' no

Me and my heart we got issues
Don't know if I should hate you or miss you
Damn, I wish that I could resist you
Can't decide if I should leave you or kiss you

Me and my heart we got issues, issues, issues
We got issues, issues, issues
It's so long, boy you leave me hangin' for so long
You empty out my love until it's all gone
You change the words but, still it's the same song
I'm tired of the melody

Change my number and throw out your clothes
But my feelin' for you, it still shows
I keep building the walls 'round my heart
But then I see you and it all falls apart

Me and my heart we got issues
Don't know if I should hate you or miss you
Damn, I wish that I could resist you
Can't decide if I should leave you or kiss you

Me and my heart we got issues, issues, issues
We got issues, issues, issues
Why fight it?
Can't hide it
Truth is I think I like it
Confusion, illusion, still I don't know which way to go

Me and my heart we got issues
Don't know if I should hate you or miss you
Damn, I wish that I could resist you
Can't decide if I should leave you or kiss you
Me and my heart we got issues

Don't know if I should hate you or miss you
Damn, I wish that I could resist you
Can't decide if I should leave you or kiss you
Me and my heart we got issues, issues, issues
We got issues, issues, issues
We got issues, issues, issues
We got issues, issues, issues
Me and my heart we got issues
