I've got this funny feeling that I just can't shake
The devil in the wires, the data eating up my brain
There's a flood that's coming up to my bed
Chaos wins and I can't get over it

How do I even learn to play the human way?
Smiles without a heart, weird mechanical mistakes
There's a flood that's coming up to my bed
Love's out there but I'm indifferent

Stand up can you keep your head?
Love me like tomorrow we're dead

Beauty, violence
War is within us
We'll be silenced
Tomorrow we're gonna be stardust

No more ego
Nothing to control us
Painless freedom
Tomorrow we're gonna be stardust

It's pulling me apart a little piece by piece
Paradox and loss are knocking me off my feet
And there's a flood that's coming up to my bed
It's a lose-lose world and I can't stomach it

I wanna turn it all around in a volte-face
Eternally recurring, oh yeah put me in a trance
And there's a flood that's coming up to my bed
Love's out there and I can't stomach it

Beauty, violence
War is within us
We'll be silenced
Tomorrow we're gonna be stardust

No more ego
Nothing to control us
Painless freedom
Tomorrow we're gonna be stardust
Stardust

Stand up can you keep your head?
Love me like tomorrow we're dead

I've got this funny feeling that I just can't shake
The devil in the wires, the data eating up my brain
There's a flood that's coming up to my bed
Chaos wins and I can't get over it

How do I even learn to play the human way?
Smiles without a heart, weird mechanical mistakes
There's a flood that's coming up to my bed
Love's out there but I'm indifferent

Beauty, violence
War is within us
We'll be silenced
Tomorrow we're gonna be stardust

No more ego
Nothing to control us
Painless freedom
Tomorrow we're gonna be stardust
Stardust
Tomorrow we're gonna be stardust

Stand up can you keep your head?
Love me like tomorrow we're dead
Stardust
