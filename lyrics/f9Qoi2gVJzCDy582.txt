It's not your situation, I just need contemplation over you
I'm not so systematic, it's just that I'm an addict for your love
Not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only world
Just think how long I've known you
It's long for me to own you, lock and key
It's really not confusing, I'm just the young illusion
Can't you see
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only world
