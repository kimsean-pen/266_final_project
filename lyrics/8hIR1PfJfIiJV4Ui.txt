I'll follow you up to the moon
I know you'r there is at the fool

But when i try to fly
I don't have a wing as you

Your light shine on me, inciting me

I was alone then you arose
Your smell of herbs was like a dope

Your words are songs for me
My soul born again for you

I'll bring you back from the moon

Moonshine
