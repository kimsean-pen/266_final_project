Why am I so numb
Why do I feel so dumb
When it's just you and I
It's that look in your eye
How do you this to me
Make me feel so alive
Why did you do this to me
So I can't survive
I feel so alone now
There's no way out now

Because without you
I can see
I would be just another
Sad junkie
Mindless freak
Losing sleep
Dying slowly
Dying slowly

No it's not your fault
There's nothing wrong here at all
When it's just me and you
I feel there's nothing I can do
I feel there's nothing I can say
So scared of the day
This fucked up world tries to take you away
I feel so alone now
There's no way out now

Because without you
I can see
I would be just another
Sad junkie
Mindless freak
Losing sleep
Dying slowly
Dying slowly

I've never felt so lonely
I've never felt so alone
I wanna just be something more then dying slow
Dying slowly
Dying slowly

Why am I so numb
Why do I feel so dumb
Why should I even try
When I can't survive

Without you I can see
I would be just another
Sad junkie
Mindless freak
Losing sleep
Dying slowly
Dying
Dying
Dying slowly
