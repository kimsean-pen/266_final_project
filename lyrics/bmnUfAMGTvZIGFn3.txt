Is love so fragile...

And the heart so hollow
Shatter with words...
Impossible to follow
You're saying i'm fragile... I try not to be
I search only for something I can't see
I have my own life... And I am stronger
Than you know but I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house,
That you won't be walking out the door...

Lovers forever... Face to face

My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather...
Take from me my lace...

You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave
Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry...
But that time I saw you
i knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by
First time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I would get by...

Lovers forever... Face to face...
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather...
Take from me my lace...

Lovers forever... Face to face...
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you to stay
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace
Take from me my lace
Take from me my lace
