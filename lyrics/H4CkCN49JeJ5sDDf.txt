Boy, No matter what we go through
You step up, I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo
No matter how hard it gets

This love will have no regrets
As long as we'll be
Stepping on the dance floor
It's me and you

Feel the rhythm of the beat
That's my heart
Cupid shot me with an arrow
From the start
And you know that it's your loving that's got me trapped
Every time I try to leave, you bring me back
So much harder at times I cried a river

You dried my eyes and brought me back to laughter
And when I lay next to you I want to wake up
And when I break up
It's only to make up

Boy, No matter what we go through
You step up, I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo
No matter how hard it gets

This love will have no regrets
As long as we'll be
Stepping on the dance floor
It's me and you

And when the symphony plays, I feel my feet
Lifting from underneath
You grab my hand
Spin me around
And right before I fall
You catch me and you say
Baby, it'll be okay
Just look into my eyes and we will make another day

Boy No matter what we go through
You step up, I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo
No matter how hard it gets

This love will have no regrets
As long as we'll be
Stepping on the dance floor
It's me and you

And if we don't step up
We'll lose our groove
So confused, don't know which way to move
Hold my hand and let me know that you feel me too
Look into my eyes and tell me
Baby I love you
You'll never get wet

'Cause I'll be your umbrella
And we can make it through any kind of weather
If you step up
I'll step up
Boy
'Cause I'm trying to be with you forever

Boy
No matter what we go through
You step up, I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo
No matter how hard it gets

This love will have no regrets
As long as we'll be
Stepping on the dance floor
It's me and you
step up(yey)
step up
step up
step up (ohhhhh)

Boy

No matter what we go through
You step up, I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo
No matter how hard it gets
This love will have no regrets
As long as we'll be
Stepping on the dance floor
It's me and you

Boy
No matter what we go through
You step up, I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo
No matter how hard it gets
This love will have no regrets
As long as we'll be
Stepping on the dance floor
It's me and you
