Let me show you something
Let me show you something

Dr. octagon, paramedic fetus of the east
With priests, I'm from the church of the operating room
With the strike support, scalpels since the holocaust
I do indeed in greed, explore meet the patients
Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse
Holding up office lights, standing at huge heights
Back and forth, left wing swing to north
East and south with blood pouring down your mouth
I come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope
Listen to your heartbeat, delete beep beep beep
Your insurance is high, but my price is cheap

Let me show you something
Blue flowers
(Drawing by the purple pond, in the purple pastures)
Let me show you something
Blue flowers
(Drawing by the purple pond, yellow ink that flows)
Let me show you something
Blue flowers
(Drawing by the pond, look, it's raining yellow)
Let me show you something
Would you care to listen to me more? thank you
Let me show you something
(Check this out)

Holding bags on down right from the hospital
It's a patient that's worth to keep the germs off the turf
Cybernetic microscopes and metal antidote
Two telescopes that magnify the size of a roach
Three computers to cup of coffee planted with my hand and
Astroplanets detached turn on rear foggers
Cut the light on the kid, and turn the bright on
Supersonic waves combine and burn as brainwaves
I see the mascot of evil he's not kneivel
Shakespeare's gone don't even think about it

Yes, as I'm going to the park, I see
(Let me show you something)
Blue flowers
It's raining green, by the pond
(Let me show you something)
Blue flowers
It's totally raining green, pouring
(Let me show you something)
Blue flowers
I smell the bees and the birds
(Let me show you something)
Blue flowers
Different aspects of life
(Let me show you something)
Blue flowers

Let me show you something

Let me show you something
Let me show you something
Let me show you something
