You've really got me this time
It's too late to leave
And neither of us wants to go home
But as we're here
let's face the situation
Let me explain, I don't believe in love

Tonight there's no-one else above us
It's just you and me
And all the idiots hanging around
Don't have a clue what they're trying to prove now
I soon realise I don't believe in love until we dance

Well I, I think you'd better stop there
You hold my hand
It makes me wanna cry
Let's take a vow
Don't underestimate it
We both know it's true,
we don't believe in love

And there's nothing you can do about it
It's unconditional, it's unforgivable, ooooh
There's nothing you can do to stop it
Not anymore

Well I, I think you'd better stop there
You hold my hand
It makes me wanna cry
Let's make a vow
Don't underestimate it
We both know it's true,
we don't believe in love

But you've gotta admit
It was as good as it gets
But don't give yourself away
I don't need anyone, no no no no

But you've gotta admit
It was as good as it gets
But don't give yourself away
I don't need anyone, no no no no
