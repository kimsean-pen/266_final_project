Never to all the words that you said
To all the stories and lies that were spread
"Don't trust anyone, stay inside and be conditioned."
"Don't trust anyone, stay inside and be conditioned."
To be a fake

Don't push your views on me
Stop spitting your slanderous filth
Even your thoughts betray
And now you're starting to wonder what's in my head.
And now I'm starting to wonder. What's in your head?

Say it to my face
Never to all the words that you said
To all the stories and lies that were spread
Don't push your views on me
Stop spitting your slanderous filth
Even your thoughts betray

I've got you pacing back and forth
Frantically pacing. Anxiously waiting
And now you're starting to wonder what's in my head.
And all my fondest dreams have turned to tears we shed
"Don't trust anyone, stay inside and be conditioned."
"Don't trust anyone, stay inside and be conditioned."
To be a fake

For all the years that I clung to every word you spoke.
For all my days that have just slipped away.
I gave my everything to you
But now you're everything I hate.
Say it to my face.
Never to all the words that you said.
To all the stories and lies that were spread.
