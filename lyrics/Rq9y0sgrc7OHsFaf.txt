Vultures circle overhead
People love to watch a wreck
I hate the whispers and the stares
But I lost you, so now who cares

Now I'm standin' in a wasteland
Of us
bones and dried up places
We lost
Don't pretend you wanna change
When you don't
Oh you know you did me wrong
Oh you turn me stone cold
Stone cold

When you're here it feels so hard
Thirsty eyes and hungry heart
Workin' for the sweet oasis
And all that's left is on the rocks

Now I'm standin' in a wasteland
Of us
bones and dried up places
We lost
Don't pretend you wanna change
When you don't
Oh you know you did me wrong
Oh you turn me stone cold
Stone cold
Oh you turn me stone cold
Stone cold

Don't look down 'cause you could fall
From up so high I must look small
Don't hate me to prove a point
We were lovers, weren't we boy?

Now I'm standin' in a wasteland
Of us
bones and dried up places
We lost
Don't pretend you wanna change
Don't you see the mess you made?
Oh you know you turn me stone cold
Stone cold
Oh you turn me stone cold
Stone cold
