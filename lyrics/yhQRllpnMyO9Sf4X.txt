Saw the washing on the line
As I lay on the floor
With a heart full of wine
With nothing left to pour
To pour

Silver moon feeling high
Through the window beneath the door
Her eyes are so kind
With nothing left to pour
To pour

You stepped into these days
You stepped into these days
You stepped into these days
You stepped into these days

And you went your way

We're sitting out on the couch
A movie plays without the sound
Words to say left in my mouth
With nothing left to pour
To pour

Silver moon feeling high
Through the window beneath the door
Her eyes are so kind
With nothing left to pour
To pour

You stepped into these days
You stepped into these days
You stepped into these days
You stepped into these days

Oh you stepped into
Oh you stepped into
One of these days
