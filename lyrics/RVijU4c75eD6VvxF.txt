To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (Mmh)

To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch

And keep talking that mess, that's fine
Could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard, tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking

You're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was puttin' you out for?

Because you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standing in the front yard, tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me
I'll have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking

You're irreplaceable

So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing?
Nothing at all to you

Baby, I won't shed a tear for you
I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you was so easy

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (Mmh)

To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking

You're irreplaceable

You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking, baby

You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute

You could pack all you things, we're finished (You must not know 'bout me)
'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it (You must not know 'bout me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking

You're irreplaceable
