(Disturbia)

(Every system fire go)

All my life I was straining on a young girl
How could ya turn my eyes on you
Now I remember how you looked girl

But you can count on me
Even though you know I'm dangerous
Even though you know I'm skeptical
You know you can count on me
Even when I know I gotta let you go
Even when you say I told you so

(Disturbia)
(Every system fire go)

All my love you were struggling on the dance floor
How could ya turn and make me swim in the ocean of your mystical

But you can count on me
Even though you know I'm dangerous
Even though you know I'm skeptical
You know you can count on me
Even when I know I gotta let you go

I was running by emotions
You were shining alone
You've got the feel on and on
Yeah I was tripping onto you
You got magical potentials
You got me thinking on and on

On and on.

On and on.

On and on.

But you can count on me
Even though you know I'm dangerous
Even though you know I'm skeptical
You know you can count on me
Even when I know I gotta let you go
Even when you say I told you so
