When he's dancin', baby, knows just how to move
When he's in a jam, he knows just what to do
He's talking', baby, knows just what to say
Think what you want, he don't care anyway

But something is missing, Mr. Big... Something is missing, Mr. Big...

You can see him, yeah he's always on the town
And he's dressed to kill he always looks so fine
When he wants to walk he'll walk all over you
He don't do the things that little people do

But something is missing, Mr. Big... So what's the problem, Mr. Big...
Don't look so happy, Mr. Big... Ooh, something is missing, Mr. Big...
Uh uh yeah...

(Mr., this is Mr. Big! Mr., this is Mr. Big!)
(Mr., please listen, just listen to this, Mr., this is Mr. Big!)

Oh yeah, don't look so happy, Mr. Big... Something is missing, Mr. Big...
Hm, hm, yeah, something is missing, Mr. Big...
Ooh, something is missing, Mr. Big...
Hm, hm, yeah, something is missing, Mr. Big, hah!...
