Stop, don't move
Got my eyes on the face of the danger in you
I want to
Be the one that can change up the pace of the room

Live if you wanna, die if you like
We could be the last ones left alive

All the other lovers wanna dance with you
But I'm the only one who makes you want to move
All the other lovers wanna dance with you
But I'm the only one who makes you want to move
I'm the only one, I'm the only one

Make me wait
And you're haunting my sleep so I'll stay awake
Yeah, you know I'm around
But you play like I'm already dirt in the ground

I can be your flight, I could be your flight
We could be the last ones left alive

All the other lovers wanna dance with you
But I'm the only one who makes you want to move
All the other lovers wanna dance with you
But I'm the only one who makes you want to move
I'm the only one, I'm the only one

Live if you wanna, die if you like
We could be the last ones left alive

All the other lovers wanna dance with you
But I'm the only one who makes you want to move
All the other lovers wanna dance with you
But I'm the only one who makes you want to move
All the other lovers wanna dance with you
But I'm the only one who makes you want to move
All the other lovers wanna dance with you
But I'm the only one who makes you want to move
I'm the only one, I'm the only one
