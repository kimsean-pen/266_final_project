I can't stand the simple thoughts
Of ever giving in
But oh it feels so good
Lending power to temptation
Trust in me
And you will regain the strength with all you need
When you find the beauty between the lines
And guide the way

I'm throwing my hands in the air screaming I don't care
Bottoms up when you're down in your luck drink up up up up up
I'm throwing my hands in the air screaming I don't care
Bottoms up when you're down in your luck drink up up up up up
We're at it again

I can't be the only one who never wants this to end
What are we to do when the sky falls through
When it's the end of the world and
there's nothing left for us to prove
I don't know if we'll wake up from this
I don't know why can't you see through my eyes and guide the way

I'm throwing my hands in the air screaming I don't care
Bottoms up when you're down in your luck drink up up up up up
I'm throwing my hands in the air screaming I don't care
Bottoms up when you're down in your luck drink up up up up up
We're at it again
