Make a wish, ya, make a wish
Lady, I'm certain that I dreamt you, over nights suspense's
Leaving me defenseless on this late night
Lost in my emotion, searching for devotion
Someone I could laugh without loud
And love em is the empty space of my heart
I could live with no doubt
I feel invincible when we create this all, baby

I'm just a shooting star, the way you pull me and move me
A far don't seem so far, yeah now, it's gravity
Two hearts hung amongst the heaven
You and I were destined, to collide
I'm open wide and these eyes, fixed upon a vision
You are all I'm missing
Someone I could love without loud yeah
And love em is the empty space of my heart
I could live with no doubt
I feel invincible when we create this all, baby

I'm just a shooting star, the way you pull me and move me
A far don't seem so far, yeah now, it's gravity

Long as it's you I want to
Take a deep breath it's time to let go and close my eyes
What am I waiting for, here I go

I'm just a shooting star, the way you pull me and move me
A far don't seem so far, yeah now, it's gravity
I'm just a shooting star, the way you pull me and move me
A far don't seem so far, yeah now, it's gravity
