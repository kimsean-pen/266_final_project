Everybody on the top got the same sound
Everything I'm 'bout to drop, make a name now
Yeah, y'all don't really know, y'all don't really know
Y'all don't really know, y'all don't really know
Yeah, I ain't never gonna be the same now
I'ma tear up this whole fucking game now
Yeah, y'all don't really know, y'all don't really know
Y'all don't really know, y'all don't really know

I got so many bars, call it kamakazee
Ain't nobody ever gonna ever stop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky
That's the byproduct of hard work, no, it's not free
I'm at a top speed, I think you lost me
Do not cross me, I keep dropping
All these hits, and I know that they watching
They keep showing up at my place, always knocking
Knock knock, bitch, I've been standing right here
Been over three years and now you just got here
Man, get me a beer and open up them ears
Let me show you now what you been missing for years
Call it premiere, I could take a boy's name and smear
Or take it up a gear and end your career
And make you feel fear or make you disappear
'cause I am right here and not going nowhere

Everybody on the top got the same sound
Everything I'm 'bout to drop, make a name now
Yeah, y'all don't really know, y'all don't really know
Y'all don't really know, y'all don't really know
Yeah, I ain't never gonna be the same now
I'ma tear up this whole fucking game now
Yeah, y'all don't really know, y'all don't really know
Y'all don't really know, y'all don't really know

And when I Rap, yeah, man I snap fast
Like ya girls back, hear the clap clap, break it in smack
Shawty like a quick snack, like it when I'm all up in that
I'm fin to win it like I win stacks
Every single that I'm in, man, it's been phat
These haters all get whacked when I spit mags
These haters all get bit in the pit fast
You bound to get cracked, so you better move back
Y'all don't wanna play with a pro, not today
I'ma make you wish you were gone MIA
You gon' be my bitch, be my pawn when I play
You gon' be my bitch, take a palm to the face
You know I mean biz when I'm on fucking stage
You ain't never gonna get me to be tame
I go insane you can't detain, it's B-HO
And I came to stay, girl, I came to play, uh

Everybody on the top got the same sound
Everything I'm 'bout to drop, make a name now
Yeah, y'all don't really know, y'all don't really know
Y'all don't really know, y'all don't really know
Yeah, I ain't never gonna be the same now
I'ma tear up this whole fucking game now
Yeah, y'all don't really know, y'all don't really know
Y'all don't really know, y'all don't really know
