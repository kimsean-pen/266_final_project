Years of being told you ain't as good as us
Join the line, sign your name
And they all said that our country's going bust
But no-one's fooling us again

CHORUS:
England belongs to me (you'd better believe it now)
A nation's pride the dirty water on the rivers
No one can take away our memory
England belongs to me

We'll show the world that the boys are back to stay
And you all know what we can do
Heads held high, fighting all the way, for the red, white, and blue.

CHORUS (4x)
