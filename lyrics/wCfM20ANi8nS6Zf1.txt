I'll be the end of your affinity to cut and run
You'll be the map I read to heal and get me through this one
You feel your way to the mountain passes here I lay
You use your body like a compass lead me to the sky

Find a way
Find a way
Through the pain
When it's gone
You wish it stayed

Find a way
Find a way
Say her name
Keep her there
Don't let it fade

The slope of your neck give me something to believe in
But when the beat hits the base it takes away my aching
You make me forget myself, but I love you I don't want anybody else
You make me forget myself, but I love you I don't want anybody else

I'll be the end of your affinity to cut and run
You'll be the map I read to heal and get me through this one
I love the parts of you for safety's sake you keep inside
I love the ugly pieces haunting you at night

Find a way
Find a way
Through the pain
When it's gone
You wish it stayed

Find a way
Find a way
Say her name
Keep her there
Don't let it fade

The slope of your neck give me something to believe in,
but when the beat hits the base it takes away my aching
And you looked as lost and as soft I found
And you're like a long lost part of myself
You make me forget myself
But I love you I don't want anybody else
You make me forget myself
But I love you I don't want anybody else
But I love you I don't want anybody else
But I love you I don't want anybody else

But I love you I don't want anybody else
But I love you I don't want anybody else
But I love you I don't want anybody else
But I love you I don't want anybody else
