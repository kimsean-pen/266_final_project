One last push with all the strength of us all
Under one great shadow floorshow
take the strain for us all

Can You Give It, Can You Give It
Can You Give It, Can You Give It, Can You Give It

One last pull to tie the slack of before
slow rolling bolder rocks, stone, pebble
grits, sand, dust, grain, speck of it all

Can You Give It, Can You Give It
Can You Give It, Can You Give It, Can You Give It

pull hold tape together
concrete to another
bind tight and deliver
hold fast, hold fast, hold fast

Can You Give It, Can You Give It
Can You Give It, Can You Give It, Can You Give It
