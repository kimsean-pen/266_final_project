Heard 'bout what you say when you're not with me
Say you live alone and your bed is empty
Oh, that's so funny
'Cause when I go to sleep
I lay on the left and you right next to me

So hold up
Why the story changed?
Phone is blowin' up and I can see that extra name
So hold up
Now you're talkin' from your knees
'Cause you know there's not another one of me

Say "no, no, baby, I need you everyday"
"This my last mistake"
And I'm like OK, OK, OK
OK, people change
It don't matter to me
I'ma be real good
And I feel OK, OK, OK, OK
OK, OK, OK
And I feel OK, OK, OK, OK
OK, OK, OK
And I feel OK, OK, OK, OK

Buzzin' like a bee, boy, don't bother me
How many different ways can you say you're sorry?
Ask me how I've been, I say "a million"
I don't sweat a thing with you out my system

So hold up
The fuck I call you back
Boy, you had a chance and you already ruined that
So hold up
On my voicemail begging "please"
'Cause you know there's not another one of me

Say "no, no, baby, I need you everyday"
"This my last mistake"
And I'm like OK, OK, OK
OK, people change
It don't matter to me
I'ma be real good
And I feel OK, OK, OK, OK
OK, OK, OK
And I feel OK, OK, OK, OK
OK, OK, OK
And I feel OK, OK, OK, OK

You fucked it up and I'm OK
Hit up my friends and I'm OK
Don't need that shit 'cause I'm OK
You fucked it up and I'm OK
Hit up my friends and I'm OK
Don't need that shit 'cause I'm OK

Say "no, no, baby, I need you everyday"
"This my last mistake"
And I'm like OK, OK, OK
OK, people change
It don't matter to me
I'ma be real good

And I feel OK, OK, OK, OK
OK, OK, OK
And I feel OK, OK, OK, OK
OK, OK, OK
And I feel OK, OK, OK, OK
