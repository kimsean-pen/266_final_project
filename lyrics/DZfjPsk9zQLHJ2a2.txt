Singin' for the lonely
You're not the only one who feels this
I'm so scared of what I'm doin'
All the time

Here comes wasted head space
Paranoia, anger misplaced
Feelings leave me nowhere
All the time

Don't wake up early every morning
'Cause the more I sleep the less I have to say
Scared of you always thinkin' that I'm boring
Stop me yawning my life away

Tender young confusion
Send black Mariah for blue delusions
Lays heavy, oh so heavy
On my mind

I'm so sick of people's expectations
Leaves me tired all the time
(I'm still a tangled target)
If your home's full of worthless aggravation
Then don't bring it to mine

Seem to spend my life
Just waiting for the chorus
'Cause the verse is never nearly
Good enough

The hooligan half of me
That steals from Woolworths
While the other lives for love

I'm so sick of people's expectations
Leaves me tired all the time
(I'm still a tangled target)
If your home's full of worthless aggravation
Then don't bring it to mine

Singing for the lonely
You're not the only one who feels this
So scared of what I'm doin'
All the time

Singing for the lonely
You're not the only one who feels this
Scared of what I'm doin'
All the time
