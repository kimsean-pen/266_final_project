Forget the letters just sleep sound tonight
Pull back the covers without a fight
But as we dance by emergency light
I fail to swallow my tongue
And I'm still here bleeding

So pull this switch and see my body twitch
Oh, as we dance on this memory
A light left blinking on its own
And my blood is flowing
Down through this machine
In hope and desire in hope I expire

Turn off this machine
Cause this is the only thing that's keeping me alive
Turn off this machine
Cause this is the only thing that's keeping me alive

So pull this switch and see my body twitch
As we dance on this memory
Despair has devoured me whole
A seed wont grow from this soul
This pill won't cure my disease
Can't you kill this beating heart

Turn off this machine
Cause this is the only thing that's keeping me alive
Turn off this machine
Cause this is the only thing that's keeping me alive

Please nurse - My batteries are running low
Please nurse - Oh, I think I'm running low
Left here swallowed by this fear
That you will always keep me hear
To close your eyes and pray for this to go away

I'm not angry, tired or sore
More of a man than I was before
Is this the cause I'm looking for
Please forgive me
I'm no martyr
Is this the cause I'm looking for
'Cos I'm not angry, tired or sore
More of a man than I was before
Is this the cause I'm looking for
I plead forgive me
'Cos I'm no martyr
You're not the cause I'm looking for
