I'm a shipwreck waiting for you
You're the rock that stop me going
Anywhere, anywhere
Going anywhere, anywhere

You're the storm that took me under
Before I knew it was you
I was already going down, going down
I was going down, going down

Anytime that you leave
I find it hard just to breathe
I come apart in every way
You never put me back again

Every time you go I come a little undone
Even when it hurts, I'm holding on to your love
Like I'm fixed, fixed, fixed
You got me fixed on you
You can walk away but I could never let go
Don't know how you did it but I'm set in stone
Like I'm fixed, fixed, fixed
You got me fixed on you

I'll be here if you ever come calling
By the ocean I'm a ghost of everything, everything
That we ever did, ever did
You got me caught, got me hooked, got me fixed up
You got me chained but I wouldn't wanna change for anything, anything
Not for anything, anything

Anytime that you leave
I find it hard just to breathe
I come apart in every way
You never put me back again

Every time you go I come a little undone
Even when it hurts, I'm holding on to your love
Like I'm fixed, fixed, fixed
You got me fixed on you
You can walk away but I could never let go
Don't know how you did it but I'm set in stone
Like I'm fixed, fixed, fixed
You got me fixed on you

Stuck standing on a cliff
It's the way you get your kicks
Ain't the way I wanna live
But that's the way you got me fixed

Stuck standing on a cliff
It's the way you get your kicks
Ain't the way I wanna live
But that's the way you got me fixed

Stuck standing on a cliff
It's the way you get your kicks
Ain't the way I wanna live
But that's the way you got me fixed

Stuck standing on a cliff
It's the way you get your kicks
Ain't the way I wanna live
But that's the way you got me

Every time you go I come a little undone
Even when it hurts, I'm holding on to your love (hold on)
Like I'm fixed, fixed, fixed (hold on)
You got me fixed on you
You can walk away but I could never let go (never let go no)
Don't know how you did it but I'm set in stone
Like I'm fixed, fixed, fixed
You got me fixed on you
