I didn't walk how you said i should walk, i walk how i do walk, and that's fine
I didn't go how you said it would go, it went how it did go, and that's fine.

I look out the window somedays, i see a million ways and that's fine
I didn't dance how i wanted to dance, i did a bit of prance and that's fine

I breathe in and then i breathe out, i've got a trillion doubts and that's fine
I took a road that wasn't but it was something i chose and that's fine.
