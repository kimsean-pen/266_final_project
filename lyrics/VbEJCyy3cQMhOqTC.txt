Future butterfly,
Gonna spend the day
Higher than high.
You'll be
Beautiful confusion, ooh,
Oooh.
Once I was you.

Ah, ah...
Ah, ah...

I saw you caught between
All the people out
Making a scene
In a bright,
Ideal tomorrow ooh.
Don't go too far,
Stay who you are.

Ah, ah...
Everybody knows
Everybody knows
Everybody knows
You only live a day
But it's brilliant anyway

I saw you out
A perfect place.
It's gonna happen soon,
But not today.

So go to sleep,
Amid the change.
I'll meet you here tomorrow.
Independence day
Independence day
Independence day
