Girl you can trust I'm on my way
I know you've come and called my name
But don't stress my stride, no rush
I'm moving nice and slow

Girl you can trust I'm on my way
I know you've come and called my name
But don't stress my stride, no rush
I'm moving nice and slow

I don't wanna wake up in the morning
Sweating as I feel hot light
I know when I wake up, you'll be gone and
We can only have this night
I want to sin with you this last time
You take me in, you're reading my mind
God, it's so real, it's so raw that I
Have to go slow till I feel the times right

Girl you can trust I'm on my way
I know you've come and called my name
But don't stress my stride, no rush
I'm moving nice and slow

Girl you can trust I'm on my way
I know you've come and called my name
But don't stress my stride, no rush
I'm moving nice and slow

And it's the lamp that shows your face one last time for me
Even the love in this embrace will feel the ecstasy

Girl you can trust I'm on my way
I know you've come and called my name
But don't stress my stride, no rush
I'm moving nice and slow

Girl you can trust I'm on my way
I know you've come and called my name
But don't stress my stride, no rush
I'm moving nice and slow

Girl you can trust I'm on my way
I know you've come and called my name
But don't stress my stride, no rush
I'm moving nice and slow

You've been a bad bad girl
