Call it what you need,
But don't blame yourself for me
Don't blame yourself for me

Cause I spaced myself from you
Cause I got tired of hurting you
But now I'm hurting too

Call it a rivalry, call it a fight
Call it what you want,
But I need you tonight
Call it a waste of time, call it right
But don't call it off,
Just call the black and white

Call it how I see,
But you can't wait too much for me
And I can't stand that honestly

So I pushed it all away
Cause I wanted to see you this way
But still I'd wish you stay

Call it a rivalry, call it a fight
Call it what you want,
But I need you tonight
Call it a waste of time, call it right
But don't call it off,
Just call the black and white

I'm back to where I've been
And my mind is where it bent
I'll stare at your name
But I'm far from dying yet
I want to lay it on the line
But all your calls decline
This is the black and white

Call it a rivalry, call it a fight
Call it what you want,
Cause I need you tonight
Call it a waste of time, call it right
But don't call it off,
Just call me, call me, call me

Call it a rivalry, call it a fight
Call it what you want,
Cause I need you tonight
Call it a waste of time, call it right
But don't call it off,
Just call the black and white
