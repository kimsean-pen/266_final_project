I know that I'm on no end
I'm never totally right
I'm gonna walk away slowly
Instead I bid you good night
Another goodbye
I'm gonna cry

Cry, cry, cry
Cry all day
Whatever you're withholding
I never said it was good
If I could sell it by the dozen
I'd never doubt that you would
I know that you would
Where did you go?

Cry, cry, cry
Cry all day
Cry all night

I had a hole in my heart
I had accompanied me
It kept me holding from rolling
Someone in the something like me
Something like me
You don't wanna be

I cry, cry, cry
Cry all day
I cry all night
I cry all day

And I cry, cry, cry
Cry all day
Cry all night
At the open mic
I sing and starve
I fall in a knife

However there's another
Another future to fight
I never took it so seriously
Oh, you're serious? Alright
Watch 'em all fight
You can't fight it

And I cry
Cry all day
Cry all night
Cry all day
Cry all night
All day

Another houser calling
I see the world that fine
I'm sick of your affliction
But you're just a small [?]
How would you like?
Now be kind

Cry, cry, cry
Cry all day
All night
Into the light
Into the light
Into the light
