We're born
With all the wonder we will ever have
And we die
With all we escaped with
In your eyes
Stones I've seen in mine
Once in a while
All we escaped with

And the pilot light flickers (Pilot light flickers)
While I'm in charades (I'm in charades)
And the pilot light flickers (Pilot light flickers)
While I'm in charades (I'm in charades)

I've been here thousand times before
Every new rule born from unknown scars
Can you blame the young hunger
That falls into every soft head?

And the pilot light flickers (Pilot light flickers)
While I'm in charades (I'm in charades)
And the pilot light flickers (Pilot light flickers)
While I'm in charades (I'm in charades)

And the pilot light flickers (Pilot light flickers)
While I'm in charades (I'm in charades)
And the pilot light flickers (Pilot light flickers)
While I'm in charades (I'm in charades)
