My windows look into your living room,
where I spend the afternoon on top of you.
I wonder what it is that I did to make you move,
in across away from me.
I hope I never figure out who broke your heart,
and if I do, if I do.

Well I'd spend all night, losing sleep, I'd spend the night
and I'd lose my mind, I'd spend the night and I'd lose my mind.

My windows look into your bathroom,
where I spend the evening, watching, you get yourself clean and
I wonder why it is that they left this bathroom so unclean, so unlike me.
I hope I never figure out who broke your heart,
and if I do, if I do.

Well I'd spend all night, losing sleep, I'd spend the night
and I'd lose my mind, I'd spend the night and I'd lose my mind.
I'd Spend all night, losing sleep, I'd spend the night
and I'd lose my mind, If I spend the night then I'll lose my mind.

I hope I never figure out who broke your heart, baby if I do.
Well, I hope I never figure out who broke your heart, baby if I do.

Well I'd spend all night, losing sleep
I'd spend the night and I'd lose my mind,
if I spend the night then I'll lose my mind.

Spend all night, losing sleep
I'd spend the night, and I'd lose my mind,
If i spend the night then I'll lose my mind.
I'd spend all night, losing sleep
I'd spend the night, then I'd lose my mind
If I spend the night then I'll lose my mind
