Driving through this world unknown, I've built my life on broken bones.
Not living for this anymore, you want a fight... I'll bring a war!
I feel alive inside I won't be terrorized, I'll take all the blame.

This Heart of Fire is burning proud
I am every dream you lost and never found
This Heart of Fire is stronger now
Build your walls but you can't keep me out
I'll burn them down.

I am every vow you broke, they left for dead and turned to smoke.
Arm yourself with words of hate, I'm ripping through the souls you take.
I feel alive inside I won't be terrorized, I'll stand up to the pain.

This Heart of Fire is burning proud.
I am every dream you lost and never found
This Heart of Fire is stronger now
Built your walls but you can't keep me out
Let's burn it down!
