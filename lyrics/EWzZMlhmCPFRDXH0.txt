Years of wait are over now
She's almost in my grasp
Now I will fulfill my vow
She will be mine at last

I feel him near
The boy estranged has now returned
A full grown man
But still I fear that nothing's changed
He simply does not understand

Come with me
I'll set you free
And I'll show you
What your life could be

You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine
Not yours, so leave me be

Through forests deep, over mountains high
I've crossed the waves for her
In shadows dark, this cursed night
My thoughts and memories stir

I've left the memories
Of our youth behind
I don't know what he hopes to find
In the shadows he waits for me
For a dream that cannot be

Come with me
I'll set you free
And I'll show you
What your life could be

You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine
Not yours, so leave me be

She refuses to leave
So I grab her by force
I pull the knife I've concealed
I put the edge to his throat

Shocked by the attack
I can feel her final words sear
Leave and never come back
Or I'll cut you ear to ear

You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine
Not yours, so leave me be!

I'll set you free
He said to me
And I'll show you what your life could be
I am free
She said to me
My life is mine
Not yours, so leave me be!

Can't you see?
Just leave me be!
Can't you see?
I am free
