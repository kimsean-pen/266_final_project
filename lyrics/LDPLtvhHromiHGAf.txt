I can't see he says what he means
I can't say what he means when he says
That I'll pretend, I'll pretty pretend
When all I want to see is the end of this

I can't see he says what he means
We'll deal him sticks and stones and apologies
I wish, oh, I wish it was through

Split the scars, get up off your knees
Just lift the marks to new found kinesis
I'll pretend, I'll pretty pretend
When all I want to see is the end of this

I wish, oh, I wish
I wish the cobwebs would cover me
Cover me
Cover me

My vicious tongue cradles just one
My vicious tongue cradles just one

My vicious tongue cradles just one
My vicious tongue cradles just one
My vicious tongue cradles just one
My vicious tongue cradles just one

My vicious tongue cradles just one
