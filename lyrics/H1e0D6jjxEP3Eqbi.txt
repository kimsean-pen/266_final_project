I told you I could walk on water
To be honest it was only a dream
Shifted street beside the martyr
Lemon skies are turning pink
I'll catch you on the other side
Baby it's a pretty long strip
Purchased shades I won't go blind
Snatch the tag on happiness, where we live

Do I have to move to LA, someday?
To find just what we're looking for, there's no wait

I see you found the CD
The stereo has company
If I can't find the hotel
I'll take it as a good thing
Neon cutting into the night
There's pressure now on what I should buy
Every time I turn my head
The sun and moon are handing me light

Do I have to move to LA, someday?
To find just what we're looking for, there's no wait.
