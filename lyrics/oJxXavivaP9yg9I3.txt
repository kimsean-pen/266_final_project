Darling, give me your absence tonight
Take the shade from the canvas and leave me the
white
Let me sink in the silence that echoes inside
and don't bother leaving the light on

Cause I suddenly feel like a different person
From the roots of my soul comes a gentle coersion
and I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion --
a vacancy that just did not belong
The child is gone

Honey, help me out of this mess
I'm a stranger to myself
But don't reach for me -- I'm too far away
I don't wanna talk cause there's nothing left to say

So my darling, give me your absence tonight
Take all of your sympathy and leave it outside
cause there's no kind of loving that can make this
alright
I'm trying to find a place I belong

And I suddenly feel like a different person
From the roots of my soul comes a gentle coersion
and I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion
as the darkness turns into the dawn
The child is gone

The child is gone
