Now I'm stoned.
Want to feel some clarity. Wonder if you have any.
Don't get so down, yeah you know.
It must be the gravity. You know you don't have any.
Walking with a beat so loud.
Whatever is up, might as well be down.
But don't get so down. You know.
You wanna see with clarity. So do you have any.

I don't give a damn what you have been thinking of
Just don't come around until you've figured it out.
This is not an argument it's not good or bad
Just make a decision and we'll leave there
Try to remember, if you get stuck
Try to remember, give me some luck

Get some clarity.
Get some clarity.

Bound not broke.
When one of us is beat. The other doesn't know.
And I get so down, you know.
Want a piece of clarity, so do you have any.

I don't give a damn what you have been thinking of
Just don't come around until you've figured it out.
This is not an argument it's not good or bad
Just make a decision and we'll leave there
Try to remember, if you get stuck
Try to remember, give me some luck
Try to remember, oh.
Try to remember, ah oh.

Get some clarity.
Get some clarity.

Lock horns. Save face. It's getting late.
My time's a waste. Time's a waste.
Lock horns. Save face. It's getting late.
My time's a waste. Time's a waste.
Lock horns. Save face. It's getting late.
I'm talking. I'm talking

Get some clarity.
Get some clarity.
Get some clarity.
Get some clarity.
Get some clarity.
Get some clarity.
Get some clarity.
Get some clarity.

Tell me how does it feel
Tell me what do you know
Tell me how does it feel
Yeah I told you so
Tell me how does it feel
Tell me what do you know
Tell me how does it feel
Yeah I told you so.
