I can understand if you're bored
But I don't ever want to be alone
Heart of plastic
Break bad habits
Always imagine the worst
I'm trying to convince myself
That you're not the one that I think about
Sting of memory
Walks beside me
Always imagine the worst

I'll make it up to myself
I'll make it up to myself
I'll make it up to myself
I'll make it up to myself

Parade of dark thoughts
Lead me away
I'm afraid that I got lost
I just want it to make sense again
Always imagine the worst

And it destroyed a part of me when you left
You burned your image in my head
I can not forget
It's like rolling down the windows on the highway
It hurts to hear you say that I was only in the way

I'll make it up to myself
I'll make it up to myself
I'll make it up to myself
I'll make it up to myself
