Flashback
The dolls, the hide and seek
We dreamed of better things
In the tall weeds
I rolled with you

Flashback (flashback)
Silhouette of the memory
Your eyes are getting heavy
And when I speak
You sleep on cue
Three, two, one

Did they make you wear a dress, did they?
Held you down and tickled you, did they?
Did they laugh and make you watch, did they?
They wish they had a little girly!
Come closer take a look inside...

Flashback
Blueprints have been erased
Matchbooks, butterflies, mornings
The grass was wet
I rolled with you

Flashback (flashback)
Tentacles of my spirit grow
Sit back, relax and hope
The second time ain't like the first

I'm a schoolboy, why don't you teach me?
Bend over and we'll hush the squealing
Put on the mask and dance for daddy
Wait for the world to say it's sorry
You show me yours, I'll show you mine

Flashback
Flashback...

Listen to the song my blood is singing
Listen to the song my blood is driving, driving, driving, driving at you
