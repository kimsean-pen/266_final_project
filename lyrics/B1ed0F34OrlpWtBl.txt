Take me down
(Uoomm)
I'm feeling now
(Uoomm)
And if I move on
(Uoomm)
I admit you're gone
And I ain't ready
But I'll hold steady
Yeah I'll hold you

In my arms, in my arms, in my arms
(Uoohh)

And you're locked inside my heart
(Uoohh)
And your melody's an art
(Uoohh)
And I won't let
the terror in I'm stealing time
Through the eye of the needle
Step and repeat

(Uoomm)
Tears fall to the beat

(Uoomm)
Smile through the pain

(Uoomm)

Feel the acid rain
And I ain't ready
But I'll hold steady
Yeah I'll hold you
In my arms, in my arms, in my arms
(Uoohh)

And you're locked inside my heart
(Uoohh)
And your melody's an art
(Uoohh)
And I won't let

the terror in I'm stealing time
Through the eye of the needle
My bag's heavy
Been filled by me
They weigh me down
Carry them round
It's all mine,
all mine
I am blinded
By
the
eye
of
the needle...
And you're locked inside my heart
(Uoohh)
And your melody's an art
(Uoohh)
And I won't let
the terror in I'm stealing time
Through the eye of the needle
Eye of the needle
(oh)
And you're locked inside my heart
(Uoohh)
And your melody's an art
(Uoohh)
And I won't let
the terror in I'm stealing time
Through the eye of the needle
Oh Oh
Uoohh
Oh Oh
Uoohh
