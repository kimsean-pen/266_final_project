You found me boxing in a dream
Woke up falling through the cracks
Oh oh
Above it all on the edge
A dangerous place with deaths
Oh oh
You gotta lose everything
To know what you had
To know what we had
I had to push and bleed
Or hit it back
But no one wonders of the aftermath
If you knew
Would you run till the stop
Keep chasing those stars
Or could you stay
Watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart
Oh

If you knew
Would you run till the stop
Keep chasing those stars
Or could you stay
Watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart
Oh
Watch me fall apart
Oh oh
If you knew
Would you run till the stop
Keep chasing those stars
Or could you stay
Watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart
Oh
If you knew
Would you run till the stop
Keep chasing those stars
Or could you stay
Watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart
Oh
Watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart
Oh
Watch me fall apart
Oh
Watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart
Oh
Watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart
Oh oh
