Come back, rewind
I see these lines
Gold throne, all alone?
No time for sleep
I sit so still

Paris to Oslo
A neon window?
Midnight TV
It's all that I need
Somehow lately
I'm dreaming so deep, but I'm not asleep

Come back, rewind
I see these lines
Gold throne, all alone
Midnight TV
It's all that I need
Somehow lately

You're stolen
I'm calling, my love
You're stolen
I'm calling, my love

Come back, rewind
I see these lines
Gold throne, all alone
No time for sleep
I sit so still

Come back, rewind
I see these lines
Gold throne, all alone
Midnight TV
It's all that I need
Somehow lately

You're stolen
I'm calling, my love
You're stolen
I'm calling, my love

You're stolen
I'm calling, my love
You're stolen
I'm calling, my love

You're stolen
I'm calling, my love
You're stolen
I'm calling, my love
