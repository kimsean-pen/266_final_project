The pest in the eyes of Death follows us through the dirty streets of blood
It begins to eat inside us, decaying our bones
How will we escape if the void covers our lungs?
We are buried in the spewed trash for ourselves

Blood, pain, nothing to say
Why then must we die?

Escape to the void
Escape to the void

I look at my face on the other side of the mirror
My face falls down in pieces full of worms
I burst my rotten heart with my own hands
I'm dying and I can't help myself

Blood, pain, nothing to say
Why then must we die?

What have I been running from?
I'm not guilty
You've shown me the worst way
'Cause you're my victim, the next one

The pest in the eyes of Death follows us through the dirty streets of blood
It begins to eat inside us, decaying our bones
How will we escape if the void covers our lungs?
We are buried in the spewed trash for ourselves

Blood, pain, nothing to say
Why then must we die?

Escape to the void
Escape to the void
