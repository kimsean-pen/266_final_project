I'm just a gigolo and everywhere I go
People know the part I'm playing
Paid for every dance
Selling each romance

Ooh, what they're saying
There will come a day and youth will pass away
What will they say about me
When the end comes I know there's a just a gigolo's

Life goes on without me
I'm just a gigolo everywhere I go
People know the part I'm playing
Paid for every dance

Selling each romance
Ooh, what they're saying
And there will come a day and youth will pass away
What will they say about me

When the end comes I know they'll say just a gigolo 's
Life goes on without me
'Cause I ain't got nobody

Oh and there's nobody that cares for me
There's nobody that cares for me
I'm so sad and lonely
Sad and lonely, sad and lonely
Won't some sweet mama

Come take a chance with me
'Cause I ain't so bad

An I'll sing a... pretty love song
All of the time
She will only be, only be
I ain't got nobody
Oh and there's nobody that cares for me

There's nobody that cares for me
Nobody that cares for me
Nobody that cares for me

I ain't got nobody, nobody
Nobody that cares for me
There's nobody that cares for me
I'm so sad and lonely

Oh lonely, oh lonely
lonely, lonely
Won't some sweet mama

Come and rescue me
'Cause I ain't so bad
And I'll sing her sweet love songs all of the time
'Cause she will only be, only, only, only, only, only, only be my baby
Come on, sugar, darling,
I ain't got nobody baby
And there's nobody, there's nobody
There's nobody, there's nobody
There's no one, there's no one
Nobody, no, no one
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody cares for me
