Grab a ride
See the wings, most fly
Try to picture me with you
Let's stop
We can crush at high speed
Hope we can feel enough for two
Yeah I gave you a nudge
Not sure what to touch
Hey, made my last nudge
Why won't you just budge
Grab a ride
See the wings, most fly
Try to picture me with you
We can gaze
Then trade to space plane
Tons of rubble to sift through
Yeah I need a bug
Not sure what to touch
Hey, made my last nudge
Why won't you just budge
Grab a ride See the wings, most fly
Try to picture me with you
We can gaze
Then trade to space plane
Tons of rubble to sift through
Let's stop
We can crush at high speed
Hope we can feel enough for two
