You're wearing a smile that I recognize
You kiss me on the lips, and you say: "Why...
Why not?"
Then we're shuffled outside on the concrete
Filtered through the crowd and I see you
Look for me

I think I'm dreaming
I think I'm dreaming

Now you're making a 3D facsimile
I'm sitting on a chair and you circle
You circle around me
Feeding you bread and butter
Morning sun growing hotter
Outside, and I ask you your last name

I think I'm dreaming
Will you dream with me?
I am dreaming
Will you dream with me?

Feeding you bread and butter
Morning sun growing hotter
Outside, and I ask you your last name
