Nothing around, but I can feel it
It looms above me, and I still fear it
There's no one here
Yet I am screaming
Buried alive, wish I was dreaming...
No love could fucking save me
It's far away, not far enough
I've seen it all - I've seen toon much
I can't forget theat crushing feeling
That I'm forever giving up
(Give up)

Can I keep myself fom
This need to find a reason
When I'll regret the answer...
And yet keep on searching

There's blood on my mouth
And I can't see you, no
If you look back right now
will you see me?
I'm sinking now, and there's that feeling
That crushing weight
That leaves me reeling
I'll see you there some day
Maybe you'll see me

Nothing around but I can feel it
It looms above me, and I still fear it
There's no one here
Yet I am screaming
Buried alive, wish i aws dreaming
No love could fucking save me
No love could fucking save me

There's fire on the bridge
The smoke is choking
The will to live is fading
My train is slowing down

There's blood on my mouth
And I can't see you, no
If you look back right now
will you see me?
I'm sinking now, and there's that feeling
That crushing weight
That leaves me reeling
I'll see you there some day
Maybe you'll see me

The tracks they rattle like my teeth
I'll grind them down
My bones break in time
The seeds have been sown
The river has run dry
This is my final goodbye

Can I keep myself from
This need to find a reason
When I'll regret the answer...
And yet I keep on searching

There's blood on my mouth
And I can't see you, no
If you look back right now
will you see me?
I'm sinking now, and there's that feeling
That crushing weight
That leaves me reeling
I'll see you there some day
Maybe you'll see me
