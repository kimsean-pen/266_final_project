Midnight messiah, midnight messiah
Come down the end is near
Midnight messiah, midnight messiah
Pray for the world to hear

Victims of religion
Victims of religion
Can you see the madness in your eyes?
Slaves of your addiction
Slaves of your addiction
One day God will make you pay the price

Satan is alive, Satan is alive
But now the saviour has arrived
Messiah, messiah, I fight in your command
Messiah, messiah, my life is in your hand
Son of Nazareth, we hail your name
To the end of time we raise your flame

Master of the nation, master of the nation
Save us from the dark and send a sign
Secularization, secularization
When you turned the water into wine

Satan is alive, Satan is alive
But now the saviour has arrived
Messiah, messiah, I fight in your command
Messiah, messiah, my life is in your hand
Son of Nazareth, we hail your name
To the end of time we raise your flame
Messiah, come pray with me hold my hand
Messiah, come pray with me in the end
