Heavy load
In her voice
Wakes me up
Early morning
Is it the end
Or the beggining?
I'm still dreaming

Heavy heart
Trembling voice
She's sleeping
In my bedroom
It's not the end
Nor the beginning
Still water

Deep hard breath
And I'm leaving
Empty words in my head
We are too close to the edge
It's not easy
