Yeah okay okay yeah we in the rough
Yeah I get I was gettin' tough
I mean shit baby I been really really
really really busy but I'm still in love
I can tell that you're stressed out
All my friends say I messed
Could've sworn I had it all
But I guess that was just a guess, wow
Baby you're heaven sent
Me sayin' that is irrelevant
You mad as shit when I'm focused on you
When the music is first when I'm not then I'm out of my element
Maybe you and I should pause
Maybe we just need a break
Imma' see you in a month
Hittin' me with hella' accusations when I'm coming home late yeah
Understand we got problems
I just really want to solve them
Yeah I'm talking about all them
Yeah I'm talking about all them
Okay come home
My phone on airplane mode
When I see a girl I see her late
Scared I leave you but I swear I won't

Is it something that I once said?
Girl I can explain
Is it the space in between our bed, that made you this way?
Girl I can't break through the tension
Say I don't give you attention
Girl I thought this was a blessing
But I can't break through the
No I can't break through the
No I can't break through the tension

I don't know what people told ya'
Blame the liquor in my soda
Tell me baby what's the hold up
Don't you tell me that it's over

What if I see you tonight, yeah
Tell you that it'll be alright, yeah
Baby I don't wanna' fight, yeah
I just want it to be right, yeah
Hope you're still lovin' me
Cause' I'm still lovin' you
Don't wanna' finish things
For things I didn't do
For something I didn't choose
And I wanna know where everything went wrong
Last time we fought that shit didn't last long
Thought we good, and our love was still strong
Strong, baby, though we were still strong

Is it something that I once said?
Girl I can explain
Is it the space in between our bed, that made you this way?
Girl I can't break through the tension
Say I don't give you attention
Girl I thought this was a blessing
But I can't break through the
No I can't break through the
No I can't break through the tension
