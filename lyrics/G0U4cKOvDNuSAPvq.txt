All your poetry falls to the floor
As we break, and kill, and fight
For something more

We're put out to pasture
Happy ever after
Fueling fire for the burn
Lies were overstated less tan expectated
We did all we could to learn

So stand there
And let us hear something For all our adoration
As I bled there
Just reaching for something to reason my adaptation

On the stage again
Wipe the stars from your eyes
As we fake, and push, and dream to live this lie

I did all that I could
I could not believe you
How they see could never turn
Lies were overstated less tan expectated
We did all we could to learn

So stand there
And let us hear something For all our adoration
As I bled there
Just reaching for something to reason my adaptation

Beg her to try
Can you take her truth tonight
This fixed game creation
When you tell the girl to be
But always change

So stand there
And let us hear something For all our adoration
As I bled there
Just reaching for something to reason my adaptation
So stand there
Watch me break
As I bled there
Just reaching for something to make me
