Hate your goddamn mother fuckin' shitty ass band
Hate the way you've got my back while you're holding out your hand
Hate the way you pussies talk shit, hiding on the web
Just the fact you think you know me makes me fucked up in the head
Hate your nails, hate your hair, hate the fact I even care
Hate the way you said you loved me but you fuckin' weren't there
Hate your friends, hate your folks, it's a stupid fuckin' hoax
Hate the way I tried to change when the whole thing was a joke

I hate you
That's a understatement
I hate you
For who you are

(I hate you) And all you stand for
(I don't care) Anymore
(I gave you) 100 chances
(You gave me) A 100 ways to hate

Hate your face, hate your lies, hate the blank look in your eyes
Hate your needs, hate your wants, hate the way you love to taunt
Hate your voice, makes me cringe everytime I hear you speak
It's uncomfortable to know you share the same air as me
Hate your lack of common sense and I'm tired of compromising
Take a good look at the end, 'cause it's just on the horizon
I've been wrong about a lot of shit, this I know is true
There's a 100 fuckin' things that I hate about you

I hate you
That's a understatement
I hate you
For who you are

(I hate you) And all you stand for
(I don't care) Anymore
(I gave you) 100 chances
(You gave me) A 100 ways to hate

(I hate you) 100 ways
(I don't care) 100 ways to hate
(I gave you) A million chances
(You gave me) A 100 ways to hate
A 100 ways
A 100 ways to hate
