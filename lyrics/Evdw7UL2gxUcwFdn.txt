I'm supposed to be happy and free
Everyone's talking to me
Most of the nights I lay on my phone, watching the world
My golden throne, darkest of days
You feel miles away, surrounded by fame

Once I was with you
No money, no issue
We laughed even when we were down
I made my mistakes
That I paid for in heartache
Now I don't know what to do
'Cause all I think about is you
'Cause all I think about is you
All I think about is

I lay awake
Trying to break the weight on my chest
This is my fate
Nobody knows the sadness I hold
Nobody sees
What's about to unfold
I wanna see, looking at me
'Cause I still believe

Once I was with you
No money, no issue
We laughed even when we were down
I made my mistakes
That I paid for in heartache
Now I don't know what to do
'Cause all I think about is you
'Cause all I think about is you
All I think about is

At night I think
"What was the missing link?"
The more I ponder
It just gets harder
My mind is on the brink
I wish you would answer my calls
I know you don't wanna hear me at all
But I just can't help myself
There's no one else trapped in a cell
'Cause all I think about is you
And I don't know what to do

'Cause all I think about is you
'Cause all I think about is you
All I think about is you
'Cause all I think about is you
And I don't know what to do
'Cause all I think about is
