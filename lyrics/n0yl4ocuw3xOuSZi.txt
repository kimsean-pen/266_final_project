Everyone knows
That I'm ten feet under
Till you come along
And brighten my day
Everyone knows
That you kill the thunder
The roaring in my brain
Is giving me the strength
To see right through the haze

Shine, c'mon and let it shine
Lift me up, make me feel alive
You've got what it takes
(shine for me today)
Shine and only you know how
To light my spirit off the ground
And chase those clouds away
Shine on me today

When everything's wrong
I just pick the phone up
The sound of your voice
Well it fills my eyes
With tears of joy
Cause I know you'll be there
When I'm hanging by a thread
You're my heaven sent

Shine, c'mon and let it shine
Light me up, make me feel alive
You've got what it takes
(shine for me today)
Shine and only you know how
To lift my spirit off the ground
And chase those clouds away

Oh you have this way of making me feel like I can fly
You're underneath my wings
So I won't free fall out of the sky
You're always there to save me
You know you save me

Shine
I'm gonna let it shine
Lock me up, make me feel alive (lock me up)
You've got what it takes (you've got what it takes)
(shine for me today)
Shine and only you know how
To lift my spirit off the ground
And chase those clouds away
C'mon and shine
Shine
Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me today

Everyone knows
That I'm ten feet under
Till you come along
And brighten my world
