All those brash young studs
They have no idea what it's like up here
I am that ragged figure of a man
Standing in a mansion window
Looking down at the strung out refugees
Some men would question why you
Would feed an animal with champagne

Paddling through still dark waters
And the moon illuminates a thin white line
Bootlickers stand aside
I am plowing into the field of love

In the dying light
I made a binding contract
With the lucid blue
Our affairs are at chance
Always to its favor always as its vessel

As you please
As you please
Please

Paddling through still dark waters
And the moon illuminates a thin white line
Bootlickers stand aside
I am plowing into the field of love

Paddling through still dark waters
And the moon illuminates a thin white line
Bootlickers stand aside
I am plowing into the field of love

They will place me in a hearse
They will place me in a hearse
They will place me in a hearse
They will place me in a hearse
