I'm having trouble keeping focus
Craving double-feature love
From the gods of hocus pocus
To the goddesses above
I'm gonna have to slack that fever dream
I've just awoken from
Live with these uneasy feelings
Of the nightmare you've become

So go throw me to the lions
Listen for the screams
Show me how the scientists
Inside of you think
Anything but silence
Feel like I can't breathe
Bring me ultra violence and a reason to bleed

You're having trouble keeping focus
Craving me and all my blood
It's raining cats and dogs of locusts
From that sicko up above
Burning up just like that fever dream
You'll never wake up from
The devil's in the doorway
And unholy ghost above

So go throw me to the lions
Listen for the screams
Show me how the scientists
Inside of you think
Anything but silence
Feel like I can't breathe
Bring me ultra violence and a reason to bleed

Give me one good reason to bleed
Give me violence
Give me one good reason to bleed
Give me one good reason to bleed

Throw me to the lions
Listen for the screams
Show me how the scientists
Inside of you think
Anything but silence
Feel like I can't breathe
Bring me ultra violence and a reason to bleed

Give me one good reason to bleed
Give me violence
Give me one good reason to bleed
Give me one good reason to bleed
Violence
