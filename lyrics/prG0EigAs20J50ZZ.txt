Kindness and all of that
Useless I'm sick of that
Kindness and all of that
It's useless I'm sick of that

I'm running with that
I'm running with that

The first time let's forgive all that
The last time I'll have none of that
Oh catch up to where I'm at
And you won't want to run with that

I'm running with that
I'm running with that

Well I'm sorry to step into your world
For a second I used to live there with you
Well I'm sorry to step into your world
For a second I used to live there with you
With you, with you

Kindness and all of that
It's useless I'm sick of that
And no one says, "Don't worry about it"
Cause you find, well, you model that

I'm running with that
I'm running with that

Well I'm sorry to step into your world
For a second I used to live there with you
Well I'm sorry to step into your world
For a second I used to live there with you
Well I'm sorry to step into your world
For a second I used to live there with you

With you, with you
With you, with you
