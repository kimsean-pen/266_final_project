I should known better not to wait around
Why did I come home, cause I hate it here
I shoulda known better not to wait around
I'm getting rid of my phone, and I made it clear
I shoulda known better not to wait around

Never did, never did I ever love anyone other than you
But secretly I always want to see you cry
So I push you until you go

Check it out
I shoulda never came, I shoulda never
Shoulda never came but you insisted for (you insisted for) me to (me to)
Crossed the line, didn't mean to
Take it back if I thought it'd make it work
Never did but I meant to, I, I, I give up...

I never did what you said that I did when I was gone for so long
(You did what you said that I did when I was gone)
I never said what you did was either right or wrong
It's wrong, you dreamt of him

If it's just me, adjust me baby
Find the words that define these feelings
Roll your eyes when you look at me
Hard to talk when you're staring at the ceiling
Push through, push through baby
Everything we've been through lately
I'll be there when close your eyes
Hold you tight, say goodnight

I never did what you said that I did when I was gone for so long
(You did what you said that I did when I was gone)
I never said what you did was either right or wrong
It's wrong, you dreamt of him

I never did what you said that I did when I was gone for so long
(You did what you said that I did when I was gone)
I never said what you did was either right or wrong
It's wrong, you dreamt of him

I, I needed, I, I, I needed someone to talk to
And you, you needed you, you, you needed me to hold you
I, I needed, I, I, I needed someone to talk to
And you, you needed you, you, you needed me to hold you

I never did what you said that I did when I was gone for so long
(You did what you said that I did when I was gone)
I never said what you did was either right or wrong
It's wrong, you dreamt of him
I never did what you said that I did when I was gone for so long
(You did what you said that I did when I was gone)
I never said what you did was either right or wrong
It's wrong, you dreamt of him
