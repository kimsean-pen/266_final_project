Tally up those points for me, we're settling the score
After everything we've started
You're gonna keep begging me for more
Watch this

Tally up those points for me, we're settling the score
After everything we've started
You're gonna keep begging me for more
You don't need to tell me all about
The person I have been
Keep believing that we've given up
We're not giving in
I promise, this is personal

Whoa, ohh
Look at what you've started here
Whoa, ohh
No, I just can't take it anymore
Look at what you've started now
Whoa, ohh
Right now, I hope this makes you nervous

Tell me what were you thinking
When you kept calling us out
Oh, you thought we would sit quietly
And let you keep running your mouth

You don't need to tell me all about
I want original, we are
Keep believing that we're over with
We'll prove ya
Prove you wrong

Whoa, ohh
Look at what you've started here
Whoa, ohh
No I just can't take it anymore
Look at what you've started now
Whoa, ohh
Right now, I hope this makes you nervous

I hope, you know
You are what made us this time
I hope, you know
We'll never fall out of line
I hope, you know
We'll be the greatest this time
I hope, that you
Remember
Remember, remember
Remember

I hope you remember the last time we tried from the start
You took things I needed
You took me apart
Take me back
Start this again

Ohh, no
Look at what you've started here
Whoa, ohh
No, I just can't take it anymore
Look at what you've started here
Whoa, ohh
No, I just can't take it anymore
Look at what you've started now
Whoa, ohh
Right now, I hope that you know
Everything you started here
Whoa, ohh
Right now, I hope this makes you nervous
