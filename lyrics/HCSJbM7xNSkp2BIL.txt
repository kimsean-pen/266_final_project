Blame it on the goose

Hey, but I know that she front
'Cause shawty know what she want
But she don't wanna seem like she easy
I ain't saying what you won't do
But you know we probably gonna do
What you been feeninn deep inside
Don't lie now
Boy what you drinking?
Gonna let sink in
Here for the weekend
Thinking
We can
See what we can be if we press fast forward
Just one more round and you're down I know it
Fill another cup up
Feeling on yo butt what? You don't even care now
I was unaware how fine you were before
my buzz set in, before my buzz set in...
Blame it on the goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on Patron
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the henny
Blame it on the blue top
Got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol
Oh see
She spilled some drank on me
And now I'm knowing she's tipsy
She put her body on me
And she keep staring me right in my eyes
No telling what I'm gonna do
Baby I would rather show you
What you been missing in your life when I get inside.
Boy what you drinking?
Gonna let sink in
Here for the weekend
Thinking
We can
See what we can be if we press fast forward
Just one more round and you're down I know it
Fill another cup up
Feelin on yo butt what? You don't even care now
I was unaware how Fine
You were before my buzz set in, before my buzz set in...
Blame it on the goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on Patron
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the henny
Blame it on the blue top
Got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol
Now to tha ballas popin bottles
With their Henny in their cups
Screaming money ain't a thang
If it ain't throw it up in the sky sky
And hold your dranks up high high
And to my independent mamas
Who can buy their own bottles
If you looking like a model
When them broke fellas holla
Tell them bye bye
Hold your drinks up high high
You can blame it on the Goose, got you feelin? loose
Blame it on the Tron, got you in the zone
Blame it on the al al al al al alcohol
Blame it on the al al al al al alcohol
Blame it on the Vodka
Blame it on the Henney
Blame it on the Blue Top, gotcha feelin? dizzy
Blame it on the al al al al al alcohol, blame it on the alcohol
