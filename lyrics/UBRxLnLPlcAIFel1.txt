Lets go out
We're still young
We can take my car
We're leaving soon
We can go
To our homes
Kill our parents
Hit the road

You promised me everything was gonna be alright
You promised me everything was gonna be alright
You promised me everything was gonna be alright
You promised me everything was gonna be alright

Take these pills
Lets get drunk
At the cemetery
It sounds like fun
We can dance
On the graves
Till our bodies
Melt away

You promised me everything was gonna be alright
You promised me everything was gonna be alright
You promised me everything was gonna be alright
You promised me everything was gonna be alright
