I guess I should of known
I'd let you love and leave me lone
Said I'd told you we can make time
Even if I need to go
But girl I love it when you look at me
And tell me not to dress like this
Oh, and I love it when you think of me
As something that you'll never get
Maybe when the night shines on your phone
Oh, lately I can feel I'll be alone
The conversation played a part so cold
I wonder if the light was for somebody (somebody)
If I leave you now will I get over (somebody)
And if I take you down would I be changed by your mind
If I stay around would I have broken (your body)
And if I make a sound you'll always think about us
I drove us to the edge
I never meant to ride around
Baby this little mistake has
Taken us across the town
But girl I love it when you look at me
And tell me not to dress like this
Oh, and I love it when you think of me
As something that you'll never get
Maybe when the night shines on your phone
Oh, lately I can feel I'll be alone
The conversation played a part so cold
I wonder if the light was for somebody (somebody)
If I leave you now will I get over (somebody)
And if I take you down would I be changed by your mind
If I stay around would I have broken (your body)
And if I make a sound you'll always think about us
Maybe when the night shines on your phone
Oh, lately I can feel I'll be alone
The conversation played a part so cold
I wonder if the light was for somebody (somebody)
If I leave you now will I get over
And if I take you down would I be
changed by your mind (changed by your mind)
If I stay around would I have broken
If I make a sound you'll always think about us (think about us)
Maybe in the night, we can make it right (we can make it right)
Maybe in the night
Maybe in the night, we can make it right
Maybe in the night
