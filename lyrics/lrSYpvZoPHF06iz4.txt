I close my eyes
To hurt you
To leave you

I never told you
That I
Can't stay

It was never
Meant to be
For me

Everyone I'm sure
Will tell you
"Love will
Need you"
But I don't
Believe you

Cause I never had it
The way I
Was supposed to

It's all dead and gone
Believe me
When I say

It was never
Meant to be
For me

Everyone I'm sure
Will tell you
"Love will
Need you"
But I don't
Believe you

I close my eyes
To hurt you
To leave you

I never told you
That I
Can't stay

It was never
Meant to be
For me
