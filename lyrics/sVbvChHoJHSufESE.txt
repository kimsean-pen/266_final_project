See, I was destitute
(I was mad too)
Now here's what I'm gonna do
(Aha)
Remember all the good times that we shared
(You won't remember everything that we did together)
If we can work it out
(Yeah Yeah)
Girl, there is no doubt
(No, I'm passin doubt)
That we can be together still
Till the end
(Oh, it'd be nice)

'Cause you're my best friend
Till the end
(Ah, my sweet)
Till the end
Till the end
Till the end

I'll be on my way
(Wait a minute, where the fuck you going?)
But I'll be back some day
(Okay)
To pick up the pieces, baby, that we made
(A totally breaking shit)
And it would be a cry to led us to a piece of mine
(Uhu)
I know I dare to love has been paid
(I paid that bill)

'Cause you're my best friend
Till the end
(Till the end)
Till the end
(Till the end)
Till the end
(Till the end)
Till the end
(Till the end)

I'm gonna tell you right now, baby
(Right now)
Whatever the fuck you do
You still drive me crazy, darling
(Yes, you drive me crazy)
But we're gonna see this through

So don't run away
(Don't you walk away from me)
Yeah, I have to stay in blame
(I'll be here)
Remember the val that we made
(Ah, what was that?)

'Cause you're my best friend
Till the end
(Till the end)
Till the end
(Till the end)
Till the end
(Till the end)
Till the end
(Till the end)
