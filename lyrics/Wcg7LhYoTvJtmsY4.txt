When all the Kings men
And all their horses
Can't find a way to
A way to save you
I've been chasin windmills for as long as I have been
Found my Dolcinea but I don't remember when
Still I can be your hero when that love comes to an end
Somehow you lost your wonder in your quest to feel alive

Slayed your hope but didn't let yourself know it had died
Thought growing up meant you had to go and kill the child inside
Wake wake wake up child
Wake wake wake up child
Wake wake wake up
When all the Kings men

And all their horses
Can't find a way to
A way to save you

When all the day's end
Remember me then
It's not too late to
Too late to save you
Remember when the darkness wasn't all you had to see
Remember when a part of you still hoped for what could be
Well I got this suit of armor and a sword I need to swing
Wake wake wake up child

Wake wake wake up
When all the Kings men
And all their horses

Can't find a way to
A way to save you
When all the day's end
Remember me then
It's not too late to
Too late to save you
