Brighter, Venus
Brighter, star
Brighter, genius
Brighter, guitar

Brighter, candle
Brighter, flame
Brighter, scandal
Brighter, infame

I stopped in for a little while
And warmed up to the thought
I wandered off a little while
Expecting to be caught

Brighter, goddess
Brighter, hate
Brighten and bless
Curse nature and fate

Brighter, criminal
I hope you escape
Brighter, mineral
Illuminate

I stopped in for a little while
And learned a host of sins
I wandered off a little while
Because you can't never win

All eyes move to thee
All eyes aren't born free
All eyes want to see
Incinerate me, angel!

Brighter, Albert
Brighter, Mark
Brighter, Katherine
Brighter, Clarke

Brighter, Katie
Brighter, Joe
Brighter, Aaron
The fire aglow

I stopped in for a little while
And threw in the evidence
I wandered off a little while
Resequencing events
