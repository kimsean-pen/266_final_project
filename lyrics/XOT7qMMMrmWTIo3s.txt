There's always that one person
That will always have your heart
You never see it coming cause
You're blinded from the start
Know that you're that one for me
It's clear for everyone to see
Ooh baby, you will always be my boo
I don't know about y'all
But I know about us and uhh
It's the only way we know how to rock
I don't know about y'all
But I know about us and uhh
It's the only way we know how to rock
Do you remember girl, I was the one
Who gave you your first kiss
Cause I remember girl I was the one
Who said put your lips like this
Even before all the fame and people screaming your name
Girl I was there and you were my baby

It started when we were younger and you were mine (my boo)
Now another brother's taken over but it's still in your eyes (my boo)
Even though we use to argue it's alright
(It's alright girl, that's okay)
And if we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo

I was in love with you when we were younger
You were mine (my boo)
And I see from time to time I still feel like (my boo)
And if I see you no matter how I try to hide (my boo)
And even though there's another man
who's in my life, you will always be my boo

Yes I remember boy, cause after we kissed
I could only think about your lips
Yes I remember boy
The moment I knew you were the one I could spend my life with
Even before all the fame and people screaming your name
I was there and you were my baby

It started when we were younger and you were mine (my boo)
Now another brother's taken over but it's still in your eyes (my boo)
Even though we use to argue it's alright
(It's alright, it's okay)
And if we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo

I was in love with you when we were younger and you were mine (my boo)
And I see from time from time I still feel like (my boo)
And you can see no matter how I try to hide
(It's alright now, it's okay)
Even though there's another man in my life
You will always be my boo

My ooh my ohh my ohh my ohh my-my boo
my ooh my ohh my ohh my ohh my boo

It started when we were younger and you were mine (my boo)
Now another brother's taken over but it's still in your eyes (my boo)
Even though we use to argue it's alright
(It's alright, it's okay)
And if we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo

I don't know about y'all
But I know about us and uhh
It's the only way we know how to rock
I don't know about y'all
but I know about us and uhh
it's the only way we know how to rock
