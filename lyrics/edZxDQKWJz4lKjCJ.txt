Jami was a good friend
Back when we were kids and my father got sick
We would hang out on the weekends
In her house by the cathedral where all the good people
Got dressed up on a Sunday
To go and spill their secrets no matter who the preacher was
We used to find that funny
But it's easy when you're young not to realize that you're lucky

When the last of your friends are gone
You learn a whole lot about hanging on and on
But if you crash and nobody sees
Just remember there will always be
A room for you in my house in the trees

Aaron was a good friend
We were in our twenties, we drove across the country
Then moved into the canyon
And he looked after the business the year that I got sick
Then we went off in different directions
Kept in touch but it never was the same
I never got to thank him
But I wrote it in a letter
I'm sure I'll send it someday

When the last of your friends are gone
You learn a whole lot about hanging on and on
But if you crash and nobody sees
Just remember there will always be
A room for you in my house in the trees, trees

I am a lucky man
I have been so many places
When I dream it seems I'm chasing
A bittersweet, bittersweet, bittersweet memory

When the last of your friends are gone
You learn a whole lot about hanging on and on
But if you crash and nobody sees
Just remember there will always be
A room for you in my house in the trees, trees
My house in the trees (we went off in different directions)
Kept in touch but it never was the same
We went off in different directions
Kept in touch but it never was the same
