(Behind the groove)
There is another side inside of you
(Behind the groove)
We can make your wildest dreams come true

So get on up
(Behind the groove)
Shake your body
(Get behind the groove)
Open up and take the music in
(Get behind the groove)
You better get on up
(Behind the groove)
Into the party
(Get behind the groove)
Life is waiting for you to begin

(Behind the groove)
You can dance whoever has a way
(Behind the groove)
There is romance just a glance away

Got to move, get behind the groove
Why don't you let your spirit play?
Another me, and another you
If we make it through to Xanadu
(shoob be do do, shoob be do be bop)

(Shake your body, shake your body, shake your body, shake)
(Shake your body, shake your body, shake your body, shake)

(Behind the groove)
You can put away your masquerade
(Behind the groove)
You won't tell her how to be afraid

So get on up
(Behind the groove)
And shake your body
(Get behind the groove)
Open up and take the music in
(Get behind the groove)
You better get on up
(Behind the groove)
Come to the party
(Get behind the groove)
Life is waiting for you to begin

(Behind the groove)
Open your eyes and see whats in store
(Behind the groove)
I must be the one you're searching for

Got to look, get behind the groove
Why dont you let your spirit play?
Another me and another you
If we make it through to Xanadu
(shoob be do do, shoob be do be bop)

You can put away your masquerade
(shake your body, shake your body, shake your body, shake)
And you won't have tell her how to be afraid of me
(shake your body, shake your body, shake your body, shake)
Open up your eyes and see what is in store
(shake your body, shake your body, shake your body, shake)
I must be the one that you are searching for
(shake your body, shake your body, shake your body, shake)

(shake it on up, shake it on up, shake it on up, shake)
There I can throw my sister glass away
(shake it on up, shake it on up, shake it on up, shake)
There you can dance forever and a day
(shake it on up, shake it on up, shake it on up, shake)
shake it shake it shake
(shake it on up, shake it on up, shake it on up, shake)
I'll sing my tilt sing it la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
