The only time I've ever heard the voice of God
Was in the silence of the night
In the arms of the one I love
Staring at the ceiling up above
I can contain the secrets of the stars

Anytime I ever woke up in a dream
I saw my shadow there, staring back at me
Moving through the walls and wondering
As all the world rose up inside of me

And I long to hear the melody
That I one time played inside my mind
And to love another helplessly
So breathing feels like putting out a fire

Anytime my life flashes in front of me
I see a child there, as if on a screen
Standing in the shadows, flickering
For a moment I know what it means

All this time I lived inside a memory
Daylight creeping in through a crack in the weathered seam
Severing the ties and trembling
Losing our voices in the wind

And I long to hear the melody
That I one time played inside my mind
And to love another helplessly
So breathing feels like putting out a fire
