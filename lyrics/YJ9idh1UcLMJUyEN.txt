Green, green thunder
And the loud, loud rain
Lead our woes asunder
'Neath the proud, proud veins

Of trains let bleed the gunmen
Of our pumping, earthly hearts
Wean our joys and plunder
Peel our shining teeth
Bid our hold on happiness

Beat weighty tests with lofty cries
Lofty cries with trembling thighs
Weepy chests with weepy sighs
Weepy skin with trembling thighs

You must be hovering over yourself
Watching us drip on each other's sides
Dear brother, collect all the liquids off of the floor
Use your oily fingers
Make a paste, let it form

Let it seep through your sockets and ears
Into your precious, ruptured skull
Let it seep, let it keep you from us
Patiently heal you
Patiently unreel you

Beat weighty tests with lofty cries
Lofty cries with trembling thighs
Weepy chests with weepy sighs
Weepy skin with trembling thighs

You must be hovering over yourself
Watching us drip on each other's sides
Dear brother, collect all the liquids off of the floor
Use your oily fingers
Pick up paste, let it form

(Lofticries)

Beat weighty tests with lofty cries
Lofty cries with trembling thighs
Weepy chests with weepy sighs
Weepy skin with trembling thighs

(Lofticries)

You must be hovering over yourself
Watching us drip on each other's sides
