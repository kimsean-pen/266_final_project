At the dark end
Of the street
That's where
We always meet
Hiding in shadows
Where we don't belong
Living in darkness
To hide our wrong

You and me
At the dark end
Of the street
You and me

I know time
is gonna take it's toll
We have to pat for
The love that we stole

It's a sin and
We know it's wrong
Oh, but our love
Keeps coming on strong

Steal away to the
Dark end of the street

They're gonna to find us
They're gonna to find us
They're gonna to find us
Lord, someday

You and me at the
Dark end of the street
You and me

And when the
Daylight hours
Roll round
And by chance
We're both downtown

If we should meet
Just walk on by
Oh, darling
Please don't cry
Tonight
We'll meet
At the dark end
Of the street
