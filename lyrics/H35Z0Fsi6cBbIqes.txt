In the night I called your
Name - heart of mine
One letter at a time.
I'll be found in a
Land of savages
Ah-h...

Maybe you
Don't know what you've got,
Spent yer money on
Desert lots -
Holy dances and acronyms
For her.

Bury your maps, they'll find
All you pots and pans
Cross all your hands, one
Finger at a time
You'll be found in a
Land of savages ah-h...

Maybe you don't know what
You've got,
Husk to hide and I know you're
Not, spending money
On a desert rose -
Holy dances and acronyms
For bones.
