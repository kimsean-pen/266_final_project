Love is a bird I can't even see
Even in the darkness right in front of me
And you were shining bright through the window in the mornin'
There's a tone that rises gently
With a wind

You can be free, sometimes brave
Sometimes all you want to do is run away
I don't need the curse, the hurt is much too real
Are we even lost
I'm silently waiting
For how the room will be painted

Yeah, I know, it's hard, this time
Yeah, I know, you know, this time

How could I wait 'til you recognized me?
When you were there inside my dreams
No, you don't have to go, I want to make you stay
Goodbye, anyway
I heard the news today

I've been up since the break of dawn
I lost my mind today
I'm at the sea, and I can hear the trains
Winds of change, so new
Blowin' right through me then blow back through you
And pull you into the light, yeah

Now I'm home, and it's clear you're gone
I lost my edge today
Singin' all my songs in the pouring rain
Pushed and pulled apart at the seams
I can feel the chains
The winds of love blow few
Let it move through me
Let it blow through you
And take you into the night, yeah
