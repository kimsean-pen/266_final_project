Am I sorry your sky went black
Put your knives in babies backs?
Am I sorry you killed the Kennedys and Huxley too?

But I'm sorry Shakespeare
Was your scapegoat
And your apples sticking into my throat
Sorry your Sunday smiles are rusty nails
And your crucifiction commercial failed
But I'm just a pitiful anonymous

Yeah
And I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
We all just sing their song

Am I sorry just to be alive
Putting my face in the beehive?

Am I sorry for Booth and Oswald, pills and cocaine too?
I'm sorry you never check
The bag in my head for a bomb
And my halo was a needle hole
I'm sorry I saw a priest being beaten
And I made a wish
But I'm just a pitiful anonymous

And I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
we all just sing their song

And I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
We all just sing their song
We all just sing their song
We all just sing their song

"Valley of death we are free
Your father's your prison you see"

"Valley of death we are free
Your father's your prison you see"

And I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
We all just sing their song
You're just a copy of an imitation
You're just a copy of an imitation
("The president is dead. Let us pray.")
