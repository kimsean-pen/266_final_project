The only thing I know
Is playing rock 'n' roll
I'm not a business man
I'm just in a good time band

You don't let no-one know
Just where the money goes
Because of parasites
I ain't got no rights

All the aces
All the aces
All the aces, I don't like people who ain't got no faces

You know I don't know why
You have to be so sly
One thing I learned
I don't get what I earn

But you get your share
Though you ain't nowhere
You get no wiser
But then I despise you

All the aces
All the aces
All the aces, don't like people who ain't got no faces

You know you're the boss
But I'm the one it costs
Gotta see the books
You give me dirty looks

You know you make me vomit
And I ain't far from it
You know you can rob me
But you can't stop me

All the aces
All the aces
All the aces, don't like people who ain't got no faces
