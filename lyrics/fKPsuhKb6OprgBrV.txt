If you're wondering where to find me
I'll be on the dancefloor
Let it in hold me
Like you never would
Like you never could
Like you never will

Oh the days go so slow
And i'll try not to think of you
And what goes lost
Cause i know you'll never would
I'm not saying you should
I know you'll never will

If you're wondering how still stand me
I haven't something to warn you
Because it self afford me
Like you never would
Like you never could
Like you never will

You could think
You don't have to love me
You can stop trying
Because now you're free
Now you're free from my good love

If you're wondering where to find me
I'll be on the dancefloor
Let it in hold me
Like you never would
Like you never could
Like you never will
