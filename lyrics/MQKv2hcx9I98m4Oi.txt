Well, the drums rolled off in my forehead
And the guns went off in my chest
Remember carrying the baby just for you
Crying in the wilderness
I lost track of my friends, I lost my kin
I cut them off as limbs
I drove out over the flatland
Hunting down you and him

The sky was big and empty
My chest filled to explode
I yelled my insides out at the sun
At the wide open road

It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road

So, how do you think it feels
Sleeping by yourself?
When the one you love, the one you love
Is with someone else

Then it's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
And now you can go to any place
That you want to go

I wake up in the morning
Thinking I'm still by your side
I reach out just to touch you
Then I realize

It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road

So, how do you think it feels
When sleeping by yourself?
When the one you love, the one you love
Is with someone else
I wake up in the morning
Thinking I'm still by your side (it's a wide open road)
I reach out just to touch you (it's a wide open road)
(Then I realize) it's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
And now you can go to any place
That you want to go
