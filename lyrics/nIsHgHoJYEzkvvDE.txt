Keep back or remain silent, why?
Because we're no less violent

Keep back or remain silent, why?
Because we're no less violent
Are you sure you want to try that
Knowing that your life is finite?

A life I spent alone, I'm just skin and bone
How could you not see?
You beg and plead down on your knees
How could you not see?

Keep back or remain silent, why?
Because we're no less violent
Are you sure you want to try that
Knowing that your life is finite?

Keep back or remain silent, why?
Because we're no less violent
Are you sure you want to try that
Knowing that your life is finite?

Fight or be sentenced alone
I can't be the only one
To warn you about what comes next

I found a way to break the silence
I won't pretend
We've seemed to pay the price in violence
This is the end

You think you know how it ends?
Start remembering before it becomes too late
to pray, too far to break, your time is done

A life I spent alone, I'm just skin and bone
How could you not see?
You beg and plead down on your knees
How could you not see?

Fight or be sentenced alone
I can't be the only one
To warn you about what comes next

I found a way to break the silence
I won't pretend
We've seemed to pay the price in violence
This is the end

We have, to break the silence
It has to end

You think you know how it ends?
Start remembering before it becomes too late
to pray, too far to break, your time is done
