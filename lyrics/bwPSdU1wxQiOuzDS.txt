And I don't know just what I got myself into
And all I know is I can't let go
And I don't know just what I got myself into
All I know is I can't let go

This chain won't break
Because of you

And I don't know just what I got myself into
And all I know is I can't let go
And I don't know just what I got myself in to
All I know is I can't let go, yeah

And all the faces all these faces well they look same

This chain won't break
Because of you
