Face it
I told you I'm on fire
But I am energized
And won't apologize
I'm digitalized, I'm hypnotized

No excuse
Break the bonds, a gasp of air
My will is strong
Get out of here my mind is futile
I'm just a statuette
Without a timer set
While I apply my dynamite

Come on believe me
You can't deny
From the blaze in my eyes
I am hypnotized and
I can achieve it
I will arise
Like the fire in the sky
I am dynamite

Face me, I belong in the fire
And I am synchronized
I have been optimized
I'm crystallized
I'm liquefied yeah

Light the fuse, see the sign
Unbalanced heart
I'm in my prime
Get out of here while there is still time
I'm reaching overload
I'm going right on top
While you abide my dynamite

Come on believe me
You can't deny
From the blaze in my eyes
I am hypnotized and
I can achieve it
I will arise
Like the fire in the sky
I am dynamite

Tell me command me
I'd walk through fire and stone if you want me
And no one can stop it
If you want it
I can achieve it if only you ask me
You better believe it

Tell me command me
I'd walk through fire and stone if you want me
And no one can stop it
If you want it
I can achieve it if only you ask me
You better believe it

Come on believe me
You can't deny
From the blaze in my eyes
I am hypnotized and
I can achieve it
I will arise
Like the fire in the sky
I am dynamite

Come on believe me
You can't deny
From the blaze in my eyes
I am hypnotized and
I can achieve it
I will arise
Like the fire in the sky
I am dynamite
