(Marie Cain/Warren Hartman)

It's the hour of the night time
When the demons come to call
And the shadows seem to whisper
And I'm wishin' I could crawl inside a dream
That would free me from the pain
But I'm smothered by the silence of a heart gone insane

Oh, heart, are you still beating?
Is there enough of you left to break?
How could he take you and tear you apart?
I never knew somebody would do it
I never knew somebody could do it
Never dreamed anybody would do this to my heart

Now the wine has worked its wonder
And it's makin' me forget
But the memories lie awaiting like an uncollected debt
That must be paid at the fadin' of the stars
By a heart that is already wearing one too many scars

Oh, heart, are you still beating?
Is there enough of you left to break?
How could he take you and tear you apart?
I never knew somebody would do it
Never knew somebody could do it
Never dreamed anybody could do this to my heart
Heart, are you still beating?
Is there enough of you left to break?
How could he take you and tear you apart?
I never knew somebody would do it
I never knew somebody could do it
Never dreamed anybody would do this to my
Heart, are you still beating?
Is there enough of you left to break?
Heart, are you still beating?
Is there enough of you left to break?
Oh, heart, are you still beating ... [fade out]
