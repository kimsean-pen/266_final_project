This life is a river running through cold veins,
No calm gasp at all, we're always panting for air.
The irrepealable decision to live and to die young,
We said:" Destroy! All we love we leave behind..."

Our awful derated state feels like a deathless march of distress.
Scraping through this tales was a hazard, so let's taste the void.
I saw it all, from heartbreaking delight to crippling pain.
That's why we left it all behind, you, me and the violence.

At least you won't dry this river and home's just a place for the heartless,
No dear friends at all, just strangers with faded but versant faces.
The future's so scary, but you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar!
Yes, it's tempting... but it's a mistake!

Where have you been?

These long roads apart seem like a promising shelter,
A home away from "home", with a beautiful fierce and a fabulous strut.
Sequel we go on declaring war on nostalgia, hours of remembrance,
We burn all the nice pictures and do the ashes like coke!

All the footsteps we've ever left, and the one's that will follow,
Are set for just one reason, someday you'll understand.
We take step by step just not to stall, but when it's over,
Steal me away and deliver my bones to the sea!
