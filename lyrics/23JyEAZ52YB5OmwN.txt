Shoo doop doo

If I was your girlfriend
Would you remember to tell me
All the things you forgot
If I was your man if I was you man
If I was your best friend
Would you let me take care of you
And do all the things only your best friend can
Only your best friends can

Chorus
If I was your girlfriend
If I was your girlfriend

If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me dress you
I mean help you pick out your close
Before we go out
Not that you're helpless but sometimes
Sometimes those are the things
That being in love's about
If I was you one and only friend
Would you run to me if somebody hurt you
Even if that somebody was me
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please

Chorus

If I was your girlfriend
I know that you could treat me right
I could see what you see
And hear what you hear
And most of all
I'd feel what you feel

Oh make me wanna say
Shoo doop doo
If I was your girlfriend
