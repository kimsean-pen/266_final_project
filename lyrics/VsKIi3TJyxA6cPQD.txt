I traveled far and wide through many different times, what did you see there?
I saw the saints with their toys, what did you see there?
I saw all knowledge destroyed
I traveled far and wide through many different times

I traveled far and wide to prisons of the cross, what did you see there?
The power and glory of sin, what did you see there?
The blood of Christ on their skins
I traveled far and wide through many different times

I traveled far and wide where unknown martyrs died, what did you see there?
I saw the one-sided trials, what did you see there?
I saw the tears as they cried
They had tears in their eyes

Tears in their eyes
Tears in their eyes
Tears in their eyes
