I'm not gonna climb
A ladder for the rest of my life
Said that and stood back
And you walked away before they could react
Hearing catcalls from police cars
And they say "What you gonna do about it dressed the way you are?"
There's a very common lie
They say you're asking for it when you're walking home alone at night

They say the only thing that stops a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun
The lies they scare in you
The only thing that stops a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun
The lies they use to control you

So you turn and walked away
Forgot everything they taught you till that day
And started arguing eloquently
As to whether jet fuel could melt steel beams
Hearing catcalls from a construction yard
They'll say "Take it as a compliment, they're only being nice"
There's a far too common lie
And you carry keys between your knuckles when you walk alone at night

They say the only thing that stops a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun
The lies they sell to you
The only thing that stops a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun
The lies they use to control you

It's the trophy wives raising trophy wives raising children on TV
Scared of people like you and me
Just don't ask questions you'll sleep peacefully
We will not go out in silence and we will not go quietly
Nah jet fuel can't melt steel beams, I've watched enough
Conspiracy documentaries, yeah

The only thing that stops a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun
The lies they use to control you
The only thing that stops a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun
The lies they use to control you
Use to control you
