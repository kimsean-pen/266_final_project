She said you can't know what I've done
You can't go where I'm from
Your lips can lie
But your eyes can't hide
you were too young
You were too young

(Pre) chorus
How I adore our love would be so true
I just wish you knew
I'd be all yours if my mind didn't wonder
I've got scars from my life before you

Please don't think I'm insecure
I just can't trust no one else
Please don't think I'm insecure
I just feel safe by myself

She said you can't know where I've gone
Or how far I've run
There's a reason why I can't apply
all of me
Baby I ain't the one

(Pre) chorus
How I adore our love would be so true
I just wish you knew
I'd be all yours if my mind didn't wonder
I've got scars from my life before you

Please don't think I'm insecure
I just can't trust no one else
Please don't think I'm insecure
I just feel safe by myself
