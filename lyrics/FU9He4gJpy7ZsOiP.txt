You can live your little dream for so long
You can follow anything until your dying day is done
So long

You can ride your little high for so long
You can give all that you like but when the kites begin to fall
Hold on

Then you say
I am the one that you want
You don't love me like anyone
So hold on

You can live beyond your means for so long
You can fray along the seams but I will fix you when you're done
My love

So I say
You are the one that I want
I won't love you like anyone

And we know it's hard
When we're caught in the middle
And we've got this far
Caught up in our bubble
So if I seem inspired
Or my laughter doubles
It's because I'm feeling every little movement that you make

You really took something
As I cannot make a sound at all
