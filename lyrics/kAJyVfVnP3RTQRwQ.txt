No more late nights
No more bar fights
No more good times
You're no fun anymore

No more naughty naughty
No more dirty dirty
No more hanky panky
You're no fun anymore

Who do you think that you are foolin' this time?
Who do you think that you are foolin' this time around?
Who do you think that you are foolin' this time?
Who do you think that you are foolin' this time around?
(Do, do, do, do, do, do)
You're no fun anymore
(Do, do, do, do, do, do)
You're no fun anymore

No more binge drinking
No more drug binging
No more binge binging
You're no fun anymore

Now that the party's over
you're always clean and sober
No sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll
You're no fun anymore.

Who do you think that you are foolin' this time?
Who do you think that you are foolin' this time around?
Who do you think that you are foolin' this time?
Who do you think that you are foolin' this time around?
(Do, do, do, do, do, do)
You're no fun anymore
(Do, do, do, do, do, do)
You're no fun anymore

Well, now this party's fucking kickin' now that you're not here
Well, this party's fucking kickin' now that you're not here
Well, this party's fucking awesome now that you're not here
Yeah, this party's fucking awesome now that you're not here
Well, this party's fucking crazy now that you're not here.
Well, this party's fucking crazy-
(Do, do, do, do, do, do)
You're no fun anymore
(Do, do, do, do, do, do)
You're no fun anymore
(Do, do, do, do, do, do)
You're no fun anymore
