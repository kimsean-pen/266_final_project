I lift my soul joyfully
If not, my life will end painfully
Extol He who rides above the clouds
Majestic and glorious
Reigning victorious

Exalted to His name
Far above the Earth
But below is where I'll see
Unmoved by Your praise
High above the heavens
Resounding out His name
Far below are my beliefs

Your majestic light shines down upon me
I turn my face... and shut my eyes
For Your light casts darkness upon my world
A world I've not chosen... to dwell within
For those who judge me by Your standards
Say I'm unworthy... of Your grace

Enthroned upon their praise
Pethroned with my disgust
Unworthy of Your glory
You turn Your back on me

Yo are Jesus
You are Lord
Imperfect God
You are nothing to me
For this You say
I'll burn for eternity

Jesus Christ
You are Lord
You are God
But have You won over sin and death
Victory's crown shall be ours
For we are those
Those You've left behind
