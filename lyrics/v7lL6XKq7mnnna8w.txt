Don't worry about a thing
We've got your number
And we've got your name
Believe us or not
We know what you're talking about
Don't mind if we listen in
We heard where you started
And we know where you live
Got a GPS
That follows you walking around
Got satellites
In orbit just to pin you down

Don't mind if we watch your place
There's always a camera
Pointed at your face
We've seen all your cats
We know when you're jerkin' off
Hungover with an aching head
I'm working from home
Eating breakfast in bed
Can't hear the T.V.
I guess I better turn it up
My coffees cold
I guess I better fill it up
