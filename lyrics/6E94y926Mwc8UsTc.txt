Turn up the music
Let's get out on the floor
I like to move it
Come and give me some more
Watch me getting physical, out of control
There's people watching me
I never miss a beat

Steal the night
Kill the lights
Feel it under your skin
Time is right
Keep it tight
Cos it's pulling you in
Wrap it up
Can't stop cos it feels like a overdose
(Feels like an overdose)

Oh, oh, evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh, I'm infected by the sound
Oh, oh, stop, this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ let the music take me underground

(Everybody in the club!)
Oh, oh, evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh, I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club!)
Oh, oh, stop, this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ come burn this place right down to the ground

My body's aching
System overload
Temperature's rising
I'm about to explode
Watch me I'm intoxicated
Taking the show
It's got me hypnotized
Everybody step aside

Steal the night
Kill the lights
Feel it under your skin
Time is right
Keep it tight
Cos it's pulling you in
Wrap it up
Can't stop cos it feels like a overdose
(Feels like an overdose)

Oh, oh, evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh, I'm infected by the sound
Oh, oh, stop, this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ let the music take me underground

(Everybody in the club!)
Oh, oh, evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh, I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club!)
Oh, oh, stop, this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ come burn this place right down to the ground

Come on and evacuate
Feel the club is heating up
Move on and accelerate
Push it to the top
Come on and evacuate
Feel the club is heating up
Move on and accelerate
You don't have to be afraid

Now guess who's back with a brand new track
That got everybody in the club going mad
So everybody in the back get your back up on the wall
And just shake that thang
Go crazy, yo lady, yo baby
Let me see you work that thing
Now drop it down low, low
Let me see you take it to the dancefloor, yo

(Everybody in the club!)
Evacuate the dancefloor
(Everybody in the club!)
I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club!)
Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ let the music take me underground

Oh, oh, evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh, I'm infected by the sound
Oh, oh, stop, this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ let the music take me underground

(Everybody in the club!)
Oh, oh, evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh, I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club!)
Oh, oh, stop, this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ come burn this place right down to the ground
