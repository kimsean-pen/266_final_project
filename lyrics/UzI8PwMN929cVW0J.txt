You don't know about it now,
You can learn about it soon,
Little hands, little face.

Lay your head in the dark,
Chasing light around the room,
Let your fears fade away.

Baby it's,
Cooo-ooo-ool.
Cooo-ooo-ool.

There's something I gotta say,
Before you go to bed tonight,
Fly away on a dream.

You can do anything,
You can be the very best,
Greatest we'll ever see.

Baby it's,
Cooo-ooo-ool.
Cooo-ooo-ool.

(Repeat)

Something needs to be heard,
And you must be the one to say it,
'Cause all the things that I love,
You can understand it better,
All the love in the world.

Greater love still to find.

Cooo-ooo-ool.
Cooo-ooo-ool.
