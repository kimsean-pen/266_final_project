I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright in black that's makin' you run
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright
'Cause we'll work it out, yeah, we'll work it out
I'll be doin' this, if you have a doubt
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out

I'll be your ghost, your game, your stadium
I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one
And I feel alright, and I feel alright
'Cause I worked it out, yeah, I worked it out
I'll be doin' this, if you have a doubt
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out

I got my mind made up, man, I can't let go
I'm killing every second 'til it sees my soul
Oh, I'll be running, oh, I'll be running
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out

There's a maniac out in front of me
Got an angel on my shoulder, and Mestopheles
But mama raised me good, mama raised me right
Mama said, "Do what you want, say prayers at night"
And I'm saying them 'cause I'm so devout
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out, yeah

I got my mind made up, man, I can't let go
I'm killing every second 'til it sees my soul
Oh, I'll be running, oh, I'll be running
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out

Oh, we all want the same thing
Oh, we all run for something
Run for God, for fate, for love, for hate
For gold and rust, for diamonds and dust

I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright in black that's makin' you run

I got my mind made up, man, I can't let go
I'm killing every second 'til it sees my soul
Oh, I'll be running, oh, I'll be running
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out

I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright in black that's makin' you run
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright
'Cause we'll work it out, yes, we'll work it out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
'Til the love runs out
