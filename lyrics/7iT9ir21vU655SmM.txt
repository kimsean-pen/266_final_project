I've gotta know you're coming back
Saw you walking out to me
But your shiver is your heart attack
And the silence that I can't explain

To know when you're the first to go
Well, it's hard just to be alone
Now fading like a photograph
And still you're all I have

'Cause I know you

Oh, it's been a week since I fell apart
they say it's getting better
But if this is the end, then when was the start?
they say it's getting better

I can feel it in my bones
Oh, the sanity is on the line
Oh, I should've gone, I should've known
That you're out of sight, out of mind

But I can't afford to lose the spot
Or you're keeping all in the dark
Now I'm fading like a photograph
I'm too scared that you're all I have

'Cause I know you

Oh, it's been a week since I fell apart
they say it's getting better
But if this is the end, then when was the start?
they say it's getting better

they say it's getting better
they say it's getting better

'Cause I know you

But do you know me?
'Cause I know you

Oh, it's been a week since I fell apart
they say it's getting better
But if this is the end, then when was the start?
they say it's getting better

they say it's getting better
they say it's getting better

'Cause I know you
I know, I know, I know
But do you know me?
You know, you know, you know
Do you know me?
