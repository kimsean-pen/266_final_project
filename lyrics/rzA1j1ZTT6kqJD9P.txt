Back of the drawer

Is this the day
Noble relative picked up the drop
My only way
Once in a way, I thought it better off
Once in a while, my only spy

Don't mean it's crazy
You don't get wet from rock

This is the day
Noble relative

Witness the crowd into the stew
Ripple with friends that ripple with you
Head for the gaps, keep a tool in your hand
Given a chance as the flat tire flaps
Go where the angels go

This Monday morning
This Monday morning
This Monday morning
This Monday morning
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
