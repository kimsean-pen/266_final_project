This day is the day that we rise or we fall
This night is the night that we win or lose all
This time is the time that we wait for a while
This year is the year that we wait with a smile

If you call, we will follow
If you show us we can tow the line

And now that you're here you can show me the way
Now that you're here we can try make it pay
For while you were gone it was hard it was cold
While you were gone we were time we were old

If you call we will follow
If you show us we can tow the line
