I want to be master of my own
Emotions with a fire that fills me
But I don't understand myself and I don't know
I don't know what my heart is anymore

I don't want to be standing in this war
Through pity and responsibility
So come into my life with your violence and pain
'Cause I feel the dance of a love I've never known

Take ahold of my life
Make it into one that I want it to be
Make a whole of my life
Make my faces one that I want you to see

I can't stand to see confusion in your eyes
When I drift away sometimes
Could I ever be more faithless in my life
For all the hope I've found in these days

It's always frightened me
How some things lose their meaning
How some things change direction with the breeze
Don't ask me where I am
I am trying to come home
But I can't keep myself from drifting

Take ahold of my life
Make it into one that I want it to be
Make a whole of my life
Make my faces one that I want you to see

Sometimes it makes me feel
Feelings which I never hoped to find
Sometimes it makes me feel
Like I'm living out of time

Sometimes it makes me feel
Feelings which I never hoped to find
Sometimes it makes me feel
Like I'm living out of time
