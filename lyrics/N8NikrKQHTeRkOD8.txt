Your lips your eyes
You make me feel that fine
I cant remember when I danced last time
You lift me up you take me down
You make me laugh
I want to drown in your heart

Your smile your face
I'm pretty much amazed
I'm gonna take you home
I lift you up i take you down I make you moan I want to drown in you

I feel your touch it makes me want you even more
So tell me that you like me and that's for sure
I bite your lip I grab your hair
The air is burning

I hear you moan
It makes me want you even more
This night will never end and that's for sure
I feel your skin
I grab your hair
The air is burning
