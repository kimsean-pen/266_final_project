He don't deserve you but you take him on
You might not know now how that could end up wrong
He'll leave you broken and afraid of what he thought
He'll be around you when you are all he's got
You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now
You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now
You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now
You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now
Leave him now
Or you'll never leave at all
You end it now
Or you'll never be alone
He doesn't want you
He just wants to have you around
You might not see all of the ways he's keeping you down
It's not your fault if you decide you found a good man
You keep on trying to move on from where you came in
You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now
You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now
You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now
You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now
Leave him now
Or you'll never leave at all
You end it now
Or you'll never be alone
You gotta go right now
Or never at all
You gotta go right now
Or never at all
You gotta go right now
Or never at all
You gotta go right now
Or never at all
You leave, leave, leave him now
You leave, leave, leave him now
You leave, leave, leave him now
You leave, leave, leave him now
Leave him now and feel right at home
You leave him now and feel right at home
You leave him now and feel right at home
You leave him now and feel right at home
