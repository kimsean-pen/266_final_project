It's been a day
It's felt like an age
Since I have seen you
Face-to-face so we can say what
we need to

I know you've changed
You don't look the same
I'll make mistakes
These growing pains, it's just a phase
We have to go through

I've been wasting all this time trying to keep you off my mind
Yeah, you off my mind
But no more.
I've been wasting all these nights
Trying to keep you off my mind
Yeah, you of my mind, oh

How long should I wait?
To feel myself
Feel myself again
Cause I know that you hate
When we're side by side
We're going two separate ways

I've been wasting all this time trying to keep you off my mind
Yeah, you off my mind
No more.
I've been wasting all these nights
Trying to keep you off my mind
Yeah, you of my mind, oh

What are you searching for?
What are you looking for?
I don't think you know
I don't think you know

I've been wasting all this time trying to keep you off my mind
Yeah, you off my mind
Hey

I've been wasting all this time trying to keep you off my mind
Yeah, you off my mind
No more.
I've been wasting all these nights
Trying to keep you off my mind
Yeah, you of my mind, no more
What are you searching for?
What are you looking for?
