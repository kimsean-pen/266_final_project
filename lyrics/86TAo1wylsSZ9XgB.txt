I choose to stay far away
From the ones that think
Money is money to share
Don't ask me why
And I'll tell you no lies

Sonny don't come here no more
He don't drink from this well
O he's done with the world
And done with the girl
And I don't ask him why
He tells me no lies

Those of us who are lost and low
I know how you feel
I know it's not right but it's real

I don't ask for love
And I don't beg for money
I'm just asking for grace and forgiveness
Now honey don't ask me why
And I'll tell you no lies.

Been looking for answers
In unsavoury places
On the highest of mountains
And on the lowest of bases
And I still don't know why
I still don't know why.

Those of us who are lost and low
We know how you feel
We know it's not right but it's real
But it's real.

I took the wind from the sea
I took the blood from an arrow
I took the wisdom of spring
And I was thrown and blown and tossed and turned until
Time found its hand and called it an end
Me and time we go way back when
I was a child
And I always knew why.

I knew my name
O I knew my road
And I stayed away from heavy loads
I'm still, I'm low
O Lord am I low

Those of us who are lost and low
I know how you feel
I know it's not right but it's real
But it's real.
