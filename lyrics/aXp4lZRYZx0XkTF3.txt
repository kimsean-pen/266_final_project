Icicle, Icicle, where are you going?
Where are you going?

Icicle, Icicle, where are you going?
I have a hiding place when spring marches in
Will you keep watch for me, I hear them calling
Going to lay down, going to lay down

Greeting the monster in our Easter dresses
Father says bow your head like the Good Book says
Well, I think the Good Book is missing some pages
Going to lay down, going to lay down

And when my hand touches myself
I can finally rest my head
And when the say take of his body
I think I'll take from mine instead

Getting off, getting off
While they're all downstairs
Singing prayers, sing away
He's in my pumpkin PJs
Lay your book on my chest
Feel the word
Feel the word
Feel the word
Feel the word
Feel the word
And feel it

I could have, I should have
I could have flown you know, well
I could have, I should have
I didn't so

Icicle, Icicle, where are you going?
I have a hiding place when spring marches in
Will you keep watch for me, I hear them calling
Going to lay down, going to lay down
Lay down, going to lay down
