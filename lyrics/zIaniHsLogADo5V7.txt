Comfort leaves and an empty heart concedes
Although it seems we're a little into deep
And it's often theres no one to console in
Fill up the holes that hide in my overgrown

I'm already crawling back into my comfort zone
I'm already crawling back into my comfort zone

Some will respond excessive force to strong
Vain embrace some discriminate
Your the witness amalgamate protest
Divergent by the patterns of our genesis

And I'm already crawling back into my comfort zone
I'm already crawling back into my comfort zone
Can't keep ignoring all the questions that ostracise
When am I gonna give them a piece of my mind

Way down deep inside we've all done something bad
They said it's all in my head and I'm just too attached
Way down deep inside we've all felt a little flat
No harm in talking to someone that might understand
Hey!

And I'm already crawling back into my comfort zone
I'm already crawling back into my comfort zone
Can't keep ignoring all the questions that ostracise
When am I gonna give them a piece of mind
Even though it's the only way I know
