I drifted out
on a cruise ship
into the ocean
I'm stuck here now
in this stupid compartment

Drifted out
Far from things I care about
If I could please lay down
The air the air the air
I'm reaching for the air
Mother nature's disappeared
Anyone? I'm here
We're here

Reached another stage that we can't talk about
Find the keys to something and let it out
Forced to be here so we can brag about
the different things we've seen
the different things we've tried
Reached another stage to talk about
the consequences we can live without
Per enjoyment when I drag you down
The way we live the way we let it out

If I could please lay down

Am I the only one
to ever let you down?
I'm not the only one
that you can't live without
Am I the only one
you ever think about?
