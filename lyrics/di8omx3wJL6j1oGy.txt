Baby I've never been a fan of your views
But baby i'm a fan of everything you do
Make my day
Dry my eyes

She took me to her room
Tender rendezvous
Call me Daddy Blue

She called me Daddy Blue
Baby, I don't wanna take all your time
I know you've got a million of other things on your mind
But come my way
Dry my eyes

She took me to her room
Tender rendezvous
Called me daddy blue
She called me daddy blue
