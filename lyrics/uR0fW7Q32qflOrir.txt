Turning back into the tide
Watching the beach from the other side
We swim with the moon
To an island in the black lagoon

Dreaming as the hours fade away
Watching as the sunlight does the same
Everything we are is on the line
Let's pretend it's not us tonight

Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away

Running back into the tide
Sapphire eyes up the southern night
We swim with the moon
To an island in the black lagoon

Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away

An island in the black lagoon
To an island in the black lagoon
To an island in the black, black
To an island in the black, black

Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
