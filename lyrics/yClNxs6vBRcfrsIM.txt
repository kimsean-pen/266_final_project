Just another day
Tell me how it's gon' be
Will you make a change
Will you find some relief
No use in holding to
Yesterday's point of view
That shit will never change
Never change

Now you're losing sleep
Turn your TV on
The harder that you reach
The further you get lost

And your thoughts that keep you spinning 'round and 'round
Exhale, exhale, exhale
'Til you rebound

Hey doll, don't you spend when the sky's turning gray
Rain falls down upon you, but it washes away
All the pain and the heartache
Teardrops on your face
Hey doll, hey doll
It's gonna be okay

It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
Gonna be, it's gonna be
Gonna be, hey now
It's gonna be okay

High above the clouds
No gravity
The sun will always shine
Even if you can't see
It's always there for you
But you gotta let it through
The blind will never see

Future seems so bleak
Look but just don't stare
Answers that you seek
Will never see you there

And your thoughts that keep you spinning 'round and 'round
Exhale, exhale, exhale
'Til you rebound

Hey doll, don't you spend when the sky's turning gray
Rain falls down upon you, but it washes away
All the pain and the heartache
Teardrops on your face
Hey doll, hey doll
It's gonna be okay

It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
Gonna be, it's gonna be
Gonna be, hey now
It's gonna be okay
