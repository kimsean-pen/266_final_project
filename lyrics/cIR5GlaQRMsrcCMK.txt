Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Whoa tonight, (Yeah) tonight we should be more than friends (Hey hey)

We're in the corner of the crowded room
I want your lips, your body, boy how soon?
And if you like what we doin' why don't we give in for the night
This might just be the night of you and I
If there is no distance, ain't no hearts in that
And if you like what we doin' why don't we give in for the night.

Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Whoa tonight, tonight we should be more than friends

From the first time that I saw the look in your eyes
I've been thinking about you for all of this time
Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends.

Ain't looking for someone to call my own
But with you boy we're in danger zone

And if you like what we doin' why don't we give in for the night.
So here we are, I just dream of you
And all the things that I'm about to do to you
And if you like what we doin' why don't we give in for the night.

Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Whoa tonight, tonight we should be more than friends

From the first time that I saw the look in your eyes
I've been thinking about you for all of this time
Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends.
Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Whoa tonight, tonight we should be more than friends.
(Yeah) Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
(Yeah) Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
