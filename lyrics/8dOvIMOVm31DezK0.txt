Heard your name the other day
It's been a long long time
Ancient history some would say
Another state of mind
You smell of memory
Felt tipped electric child

She takes the plastic pill, she plays "The Weatherman"
She screams "Religion kills more than it saves a man"
She painted filigrees, she was the Acid Queen
She claims "Society is just a fever dream"

Now you live in the trees and salty seas
Trippin' out in the blue skies
You shut the door on everythin'
Too busy gettin' high
And me, just another dream theory
Lost inside your eyes

She's not in your history books, lost her mind and kept her looks
Down beneath the radar screen, she's lit up like gasoline
Been through a million kicks, lookin' for the one that sticks
Never would've known it then, I might not see her again

Top hat and tails for thrills
Red lips and famous hands
Sidelong and glancin' still
In tiny dancer land

We kissed, time slipped
Hard edged tight lipped
See you sometime
Ask me if I care
For Karen
Miss Communication
