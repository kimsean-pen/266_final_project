The doctor said, "Come back again next week
I think that you need me"
All she did was cry, she wanted to die
"Doctor when can you see me here?"
There's a guy out there
Seems like he's everywhere, it just ain't fair

Heartless, heartless,
Never, never out of control
Heartless, heartless
Ya keep on sinnin'
In the name of a-rock and roll

Heartless, heartless
Ya think he's gonna bare his empty soul?
He never realized, the way love dies
When you crucify it's soul

Late night, in the penthouse room, the fire is burnin'
The shadows are warm
She lay in his arms, answers his yearning
D'ya think she understand the lie of his plans
Her eyes are filled with sand

Heartless, heartless
Never, never out of control
Heartless, heartless
Ya keep on sinnin' in the name of rock and roll

Heartless, heartless
It's so cool to be cold
He never realized, the way love dies
When you crucify it's soul

Heartless, heartless
Never, never out of control no no
Heartless, heartless
Ya keep sinnin' in the name of a-rock and roll

Heartless, come on he's heartless
Ya think it's gonna fill your empty soul?
But ya never realized, the way love dies
When you crucify it's soul
My Lord you never realized
You never ever realized
