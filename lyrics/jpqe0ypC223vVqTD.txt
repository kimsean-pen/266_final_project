You're coming slow, I hear you're so bad
I kinda love your vain
I'll love you slow
You're feeling so fast, you'll kinda love this pace
Whining inside, come into focus, don't wanna lose your face
I'll hold your mouth, we're feeling invaded, feeding from your blood

Oh, I feel your body falling
Oh, but hold on when it's raining... feel your weight

We're breaking the waves, Ooh, ha-ha
Like a prayer
We're breaking the waves

My body loves feeling invaded by your gentle grace
You feel this stain, We both can't be saying this
I wanna love your faith

Oh, I feel your body falling
Oh, but hold on when it's raining, feel your weight (feel your weight)
Oh, I feel your body falling (Huh, huh, wait)
Oh, but hold on when it's raining feel your weight, I feel your

Don't worry, baby
Surrender to your knees
Don't worry, baby
Surrender to your
Don't worry, baby
Surrender to your knees
Don't worry, baby
Surrender to your needs

I feel your weight
I feel your weight
I feel your weight
I feel your...
