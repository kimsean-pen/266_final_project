Got a feeling it's a fever it's a fire
Talking trouble take it down into the wire
Once chance two chance
It's a lie
It's old and old and old and worn out
Light it up for real and watch it work a way
Got no memory of ever being made
We'll take heart, take heart anyway
Your own, your own, your own are not now

Light it up
Light it up

Taking comfort in the promises of pride
A blade incision it will never help decide
We're growing up, growing out of a life
It won't, it won't, it won't fit anyone
Got a feeling it's a fever it's a fire
Marking territory a faction for a fight
Take heart, take heart 'cos the lie
It's old, it's old, it's old and worn out
It's old it's old and worn out

Light it up
Light it up
Light it up for real
Light it up and we'll see
Light it up
Light it up for real
Light it up and we'll see
Light it up

Light it up
Light it up
Light it up for real
Light it up and we'll see
Light it up
Light it up for real
Light it up and we'll see
Light it up
