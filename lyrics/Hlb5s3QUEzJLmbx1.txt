Is this me
Breaking free
Or just breaking down ha ha
A comic vision
Don't you feel proud
It's such a
How do
You do
Well this is not the done thing
Dance for me Baby let's begin the beguin
Ha ha ha ha ha

Do you remember the way we danced
I wish I could forget it
Said I'd give you the one last chance
I wish I'd never said it
Took a chance and I can't turn back
And I'm living to regret it
Come on, come on to me

Can't slow down
You dictate
The speed of the chase
Bitter sweet bitter's
The way that you taste
I won't waste this
Passion, it's true
I'm an everyday fool
No rhyme or reason to the
Things that I do
Ha ha ha ha ha

Do you remember the way we danced
I wish I could forget it
Said I'd give you the one last chance
I wish I'd never said it
Took a chance and I can't turn back
And I'm living to regret it
Come on, come on to me

Feed me
All your lies
Yes it's a gas
A word to the wise
You're blindingly obvious lately
Doctor
Cure me
Somebody take away this
Seed of the devil
In the core of his kiss
Ha ha ha ha ha

Do you remember the way we danced
I wish I could forget it
Said I'd give you the one last chance
I wish I'd never said it
Took a chance and I can't turn back
And I'm living to regret it
Come on, come on to me

And some things
Got built in
Their own punishment
The repercussions
Will sure enough be felt
Ha ha ha ha ha
That which does not kill
Will make you stronger
No longer
In these Eyes
It's denial
No long or short
Goodbyes

Baby you came close
Baby come closer
And come on to me
Baby you came close
Baby come closer
And come on to me
Baby come closer
Baby come closer
Baby come closer

Do you remember the way we danced
I wish I could forget it
Said I'd give you the one last chance
I wish I'd never said it
Took a chance and I can't turn back
And I'm living to regret it
Come on, come on to me

No one's stopping you
We should've stopped at the start
At the start
Should have parted
Do it finish me off
Ha ha ha ha ha

If it's the end
The end
Then let me play the last tune
Begin the beguin
And play the notes of my doom
Ha ha ha ha ha
