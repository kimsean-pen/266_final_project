Hear me from low
Hear me shallow
Can I run fast?
There's gets no skull
These are days and days and days away
I run alone, the fallen from today
Don't forget me, don't forget my name
Every day are days and days the same

Hear me speak now
I am king now
Hear our future
Running, round ties
These are days and days and days away
I run alone, the fallen from today
Don't forget me, don't forget my name
Every day are days and days the same
