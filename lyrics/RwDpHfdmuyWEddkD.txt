I don't really want to get to know you
I don't really want to catch your first name
I've got all the drinks that I can handle
Stop telling me so much about yourself

What makes you so certain
That I want to be forced to notice you
You're not even aware of what a burden you are
Too vain to even read what I'm thinking

Hey there rude boy, is that all?
How'd you get this way?
All you are is face
You need to be everything if you want anything

I can't seem to understand politeness
I can't seem to argue when you're wrong much longer
You can't seem to get enough attention
You can give someone else your number

What makes you so certain
That I want to be forced to notice you
You're not even aware of what a burden you are
Too vain to even read what I'm thinking

Hey there rude boy, must you go on?
My minds been made
All you are is fake
You need to be everything if you want anything

Hey there rude boy, I've had enough
I don't fall for that
Do you have a heart?
You need to be certain inside if you want anything
