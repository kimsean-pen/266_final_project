I left my heart to the sapper's round Khe Sanh
And I sold my soul with my cigarettes to the black market man
I've had the Vietnam cold turkey from the ocean to the silver city
And it's something other vets could understand

About the long forgotten dockside guarantees
How there were no V-Day heroes in 1973
And how we sailed into Sydney Harbour
I saw an old friend but I couldn't kiss her
She was lined and I was home to the lucky land

She was like so many more from that time on
Their lives were all so empty 'til they found their chosen one
And their legs were often open but their minds were always closed
And their hearts were held in fast suburban chains

And the legal pads were yellow, hours long, paypackets lean
And the telex writers clattered where the gunships once had been
Carparks make me jumpy and I've never stopped the
dreams or the growing need for speed and Novocain

So I worked to cross the country from end to end
Tried to find a place to settle down where my mixed up life could mend
I held a job on an oil rig, flying choppers when I could
But the nightlife nearly drove me 'round the bend

And I've travelled 'round the world from year to year
And each one found me aimless one more year the worse for wear
And I've been back to South-East Asia and the answer sure ain't there
But I'm drifting off to check things out again
Yes I am

Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
In only seven flying hours and I'll be landing in Hong Kong
And there ain't nothing like the kisses from a jaded Chinese princess
I'm gonna hit some Hong Kong mattress all night long

Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
And it's really got me worried
I'm going nowhere and I'm in a hurry
You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone

Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
Ohhhhh
It's really got me worried
I'm going nowhere and I'm in a hurry
You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
