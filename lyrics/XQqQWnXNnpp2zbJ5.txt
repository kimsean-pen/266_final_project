Pick up the phone, and I'ma slide
I'd never wanna be this guy
You still talk about me a lot

I ain't never home, I like to ride
We used to have to stand outside
Now you hate the fact that I'm hot

And you say you don't miss me, then you
Miss me. Miss me with all that
Tried to cut my baby loose and she came
Right back
And you say you don't miss me, then you
Miss me. Miss me with all that
Tried to cut my baby loose and she came
Right back

I been selling out shows
Fucking hella, I been on a roll
Boutta cop a Rover for the snow
'Cause when I come 'round, niggas better
Know

(Damn)

Stressed out
What's even worse is this is how I get my
Checks now
We all guilty, I know niggas who ain't getting out
Why do I feel cursed if I'm so blessed now? (Why?)

And you say you don't miss me, then you
Miss me. Miss me with all that
Tried to cut my baby loose and she came
Right back
And you say you don't miss me, then you
Miss me. Miss me with all that
I know you lying like shit
Tried to cut my baby loose and she came
Right back

I know you lying like shit
