The situation is getting boring, you're not gonna spoil another day
I don't expect you to be calling, you're always gonna act that way
You've said those lines so many times, I've heard it all before
What makes you think that I will keep hanging 'round for more?

If you wanna be the one, be the one who moves my Heaven and earth
You wanna be the one, be the one who shares my hunger and thirst
You see the other ones are hanging on, ooh, they've got nothing on you
You wanna be the one, be the one, the only one

You say you're hooked on me, but where were you last night?
Because when you looked at me, yeah, you couldn't hold my eye
Saying things you never mean, it's no big surprise
Telling me that you're the one, I'm tired of the lies

Be the one, be the one who moves my Heaven and earth
You wanna be the one, be the one who shares my hunger and thirst
You see the other ones are hanging on, ooh, they've got nothing on you
You wanna be the one, be the one, the only one

I've got no time for bitterness, I wanna move away from this
I've found myself somebody, ooh ooh ooh

Be the one, be the one who moves my Heaven and earth
You wanna be the one, be the one who shares my hunger and thirst
You see the other ones are hanging on, ooh, they've got nothing on you
You wanna be the one, be the one, the only one

I've got no time for bitterness, I wanna move away from this
I've found myself somebody, ooh ooh ooh
