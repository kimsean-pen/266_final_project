Would you say anything,
anything at all?
Would you share with me your innocence,
what I need to seize the fall.
I know to keep close to you,
know to keep near regardless if it's wrong
Now I'm tearing apart what I made for us,
dissembling to be strong.

You swore on your own,
you set it in stone, your slithering.
You silence your words, you're leaving,
you bring it to your grave.

Waiting for reason to claim its place,
clearing the air I can see all the ways
it's my addiction that always is growing
and it scares me in my sober moments.

You decide, close our distance
I destroyed you; undeservedly

You decide, close our distance
I assure you're undeserving of.
