Pop culture with a pin
Watch it wheeze in the air like a dying balloon
A mistake dawned on me
And the rest of my tribe: "Your wish is our command"
No really, it's OK
Give yourself a group hug and a pat on the back
No really, it's alright
Pose your best for a shot from the firing squad

Choosing my defence
I'll stay on the fence

Sneak a gun through the gates of heaven
Raiding tomorrow's prayers with a stained silver bullet
Oh how it kills me waiting to follow through
On a dare

Pop culture with a pill
Watch it make all the worms in your mind disappear
Maybe so, maybe not
Never sure if it's me underneath a white sheet
Halloween Halloween
With a mask I can be your new friend for a while
Trick or treat, trick or treat
There's a razorblade inside your candy bar

Choosing my defence
I'll stay on the fence
Choosing my defence
I'll stay on the fence

Sneak a gun through the gates of heaven
Raiding tomorrow's prayers with a stained silver bullet
Oh how it kills me waiting to follow through
On a dare, dare
Choosing my defence
I'll stay on the fence

Pop culture on your skin
You cannot keep your fingers away from your face
Memories are haunting me
Like fish floating dead at the top of a tank

Sneak a gun through the gates of heaven
Raiding tomorrow's prayers with a stained silver bullet
Oh how it kills me waiting to follow through
On a dare, dare

Choosing my defence
I'll stay on the fence
On a dare, dare
On a dare, dare!
