Hi, my name is StereoMike

Yeah, we got 3 tickets to the Bran Van concert this Monday night
at the Pacific Pallisades. You can all dial in if you want to answer
a couple of questions, namely,
what is Todd's favorite cheese.
Jackie just called up and said it was a form of Roquefort.
We'll see about that...

give us a ring-ding-ding! It's a beautiful day.

Yeah Todd, this is Liquid ring-a-ding-a-dinging
I want those 3 Bran Van tickets man
waddya think?
Todd, you there?

I woke up again this morning with the sun in my eyes
when Mike came over with a script surprise
a mafioso story with a twist
a "Too Wong Foo, Julie Newmar" hitch
get your ass out of bed, he said:
I'll explain it on the way

but we did nothing
absolutely nothing that day
and I'll say
what the hell am I doing drinking in LA
at twenty six?
I got the fever for the flavor
the payback will be later
still I need a fix

and the girls on the bus kept on laughing at us
as we rode on the ten down to Venice again
flaring out the g-funk
sipping on juice and gin
just me and a friend
feeling kinda groovy
working on movie
(yeah right!)

but we did nothing
absolutely bupkis
that day
and I'll say
what the hell am I doing drinking in LA
at twenty six?
with my mind on my money and my money on my, beer beer!
I know that life is for the taking
so I'd better wise up
and take it quickly

(yeah one more time at trader vics)

some men there wanted to hurt us
and other men
said we weren't worth the fuss
we could see them all bitching by the bar
about the fine line
between the rich and the poor
then mike turned to me and said
what do you think we got done son?

we've got a conclusion
and I guess that's something
so I ask you
what the hell am I doing drinking in LA
at twenty six?
I got the fever for the nectar
the payback will be later
still I need a fix

(we need to fix you up
call me monday
and maybe we'll fix it all up)
