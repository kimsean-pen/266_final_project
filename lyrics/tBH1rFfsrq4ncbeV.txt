I want her love
Baby, I get down on my knees
Purple bubble
I saw my life inside the sea

Condemned to be f-f-f-freaky

I want her love
Talking 'bout a sexy stationary
What I'm dreaming of
Faces that awake for you and me

Condemned to be f-f-f-freaky

Function of words is to conceive a thought
And uhm, ...
(Laughing)

Head through flowers dressed like the butterflies
And here's the story, over and over again

F-f-f-freaky
