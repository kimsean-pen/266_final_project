indecision, poor decision
led me to believe
that you live and you learn
till you earn your own worst enemy
cross my heart and hope to die
unless you got something better
if misery loves company
why aren't we in this together

all has been said
and all has been done
take a number
you ain't the only one

the easy way out
it's a dangerous path
and no one knows it like i do
beat the door down
and shatter the glass
but you better be sure what it leads to
what it leads to

the lash i felt from the bible belt
got me down on my knees
when i thought that i could stand
on my own two feet
thorazine dreams are thundering
in dangerous weather
where in my head i'll soon be dead
or soon feeling better

all has been said
and all has been done
take a number babe
you ain't the only one

the easy way out
it's a dangerous path
and no one knows it like i do
beat the door down
and shatter the glass

but you better be sure what it leads to
what it leads to
