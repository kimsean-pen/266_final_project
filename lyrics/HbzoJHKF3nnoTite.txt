Wha-wha-wha-wha-what did she say?

Mmh, whatcha say
Mmh, that you only meant well
Well, of course you did

Mmh, whatcha say (Jason Derulo)
Mmh, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is

I was so wrong for so long
Only tryin' to please myself
Girl, I was caught up in her lust
When I don't really want no one else

So no, I know I should of treated you better
But me and you were meant to last forever
So let me in, give me another chance
To really be your man

'Cause when the roof cave in, and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star, we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you

So tell me girl

Mmh, whatcha say
Mmh, that you only meant well
Well, of course you did

Mmh, whatcha say (Oh whatcha say, whatcha say)
Mmh, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is

Mmh, whatcha say
Mmh, that you only meant well
Well, of course you did

Mmh, whatcha say (Oh whatcha say, whatcha say)
Wha-wha-wha-wha-what did she say?

How could I live with myself
Knowing that I let our love go
And oh, when I do with one chance
I just gotta let you know

I know what I did wasn't clever
But me and you we're meant to be together
So let me in, give me another chance
To really be your man

'Cause when the roof cave in, and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star, we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you

So tell me girl

Mmh, whatcha say
Mmh, that you only meant well
Well, of course you did

Mmh, whatcha say (Oh whatcha say, whatcha say)
Mmh, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is

Mmh, whatcha say
Mmh, that you only meant well
Well, of course you did

Mmh, whatcha say (Oh whatcha say, whatcha say)
Wha-wha-wha-wha-what did she say?

Girl, tell me whatcha said
I don't want you to leave me
Though you caught me cheatin'

Tell me, tell me whatcha said
I really need you in my life
'Cause things ain't right, girl

Tell me, tell me whatcha said
I don't want you to leave me
Though you caught me cheatin'

Tell me, tell me whatcha said
I really need you in my life
'Cause things ain't right

'Cause when the roof cave in, and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do (I just didn't know what to do)
But when I become a star, we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you

So baby watcha say!

Mmh, whatcha say
Mmh, that you only meant well
Well, of course you did

Mmh, whatcha say (Oh whatcha say, whatcha say)
Mmh, that it's all for the best?
