When did we become these sinking stones?
When did we build this broken home?
Holding each other like ransom notes
Dropping our hearts to grip our brother's throats (Walking blind!)

You can't see
Because you don't know
You're caught below
Beneath your own shadow
Stuck inside
Half alive
Do you ever stop to ask yourself why?
Close your mind
Identify
Do you feel, do you feel
Do you call this a life?
All you waited for
Drowning just to keep score

We always start with good intentions
But lose ourselves along the way

This is the time that we let it go
These are the words that will take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we don't open our eyes we're
Walking blind

Anchored in anger, we exile ourselves
Bitter blood builds our prison cell
Darker water now fills our lungs
The depths of our heart have blacked the sun
(Walking blind!)

You can't see
Because you don't know
You're caught below
Beneath your own shadow
Stuck inside
Half alive
Do you ever stop to ask yourself why? (Walking blind)
Close your mind
Identify
Do you feel, do you feel
Do you call this a life?
All you waited for
Drowning just to keep score

We always start with good intentions
But lose ourselves along the way

This is the time that we let it go
These are the words that will take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we don't open our eyes we're
Walking blind!

Naked we come
Naked we leave
Fools we are to hold tightly

We are free
We are free (We are... We are the key! We are the jail! We are the key!)

This is the time that we let it go
Yeah, these are the words that'll take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we just open our eyes! (If we just open our eyes!)

This is the time that we let it go
This is the pain we are forced to know
Singing the song that's inside
Inside us all, inside us all!
Walking Blind!
