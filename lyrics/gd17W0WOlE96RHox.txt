From the secrets we hide
Disaster is, a master is
We lay here burning in bed
But something tells me
I cannot kill someone new yet
I will knock you out, burn you today

I will forgive, forgive
'Cause I know that it will set me free
But all thats left its the emptiness inside of me
You murder my heart
Broke my just and watch me fade away
Now I see, now I see
That you just as broken as me

You just as broken as me
You always play the victim
And you just can't decide
