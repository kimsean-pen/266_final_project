Free at last
Finally tasting happiness
Five years of hell for nothing
Trapped inside the minds of failures

A wise man once said
"That which does not kill us makes us stronger"
But we were dead
So are we now invincible?

Determination, perseverance, resolution
Resurrection
Determination, perseverance, resolution
Resurrection

Final straw underlining ignorance
Consumed by greed and hate
Nothing swept under the veil of silence

Reality can't hear
Ways to get stopped just to start all over
Treated like shit
Pushed aside and expect to pull

Determination, perseverance, resolution
Resurrection
Determination, perseverance, resolution
Resurrection

We have become so goddamn powerful
We have become so goddamn powerful
We have become so goddamn powerful
We have become so goddamn powerful
We have become so goddamn powerful
We have become so goddamn powerful

All the beatings you gave us
We will use them against you
All the beatings you gave us
We will use them against you

Determination, perseverance, resolution
Resurrection
Determination, perseverance, resolution
Resurrection

Free at last
Finally tasting happiness
The resurrection, resurrection
Resurrection, resurrection
