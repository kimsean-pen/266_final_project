This
Torn portrait
Was out of focus
So focus on setting
The clock back
To before
You were born and enjoy
Being nothing
When you
Can't cast a shadow

Where nothing
Is absent
Your absence is nothing

Our existence
Is the same way
Experience we borrow

This is
Just a
Very long
Boring dream
It caused the conundrum
Wake me up or
Kill me

Can you help me finally?
