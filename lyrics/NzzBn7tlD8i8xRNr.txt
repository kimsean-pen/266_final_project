SOS
We've come unmoored
Rip tide pulling, pulling away from the shore
But we feel safe inside
Not a wave in sight
Hang on tight
The water's fine

Rock the boat
We've come unmoored
Slipped the cleat, lost at sea
Crack in the centerboard
But we feel safe for now
As long as time allows
Hang on tight

Rushes by too fast
And never seems to last
Hanging ten
Waiting here before the mast

Ship of fools
We've come unmoored
Rip tide pulling, pulling away from the shore
But we feel safe inside
Not a wave in sight
Hang on tight
There's still time
The water's fine
