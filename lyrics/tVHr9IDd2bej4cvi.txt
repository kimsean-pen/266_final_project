Could you move in slow motion?
Everything goes by so fast
Just slow down a little
Save the best part for last

You speak in riddles
Your intentions turn me old
I'm yours forever
Will you love me when I'm gone?

When I'm gone

You're an undiscovered
(When I'm gone)
Over walls we've trampled
(When I'm gone)

It's you I admire
(When I'm gone)
My living example
Oh, your eyes are
An undiscovered ocean far away
Any minute now
Keeping both poets and priests at bay

Eh, don't get ahead of me, could we

Just this once see eye to eye?
Could you want perhaps me?
Ask me how it feels to vie?
To vie

You're an undiscovered
(To vie)
Over walls we've trampled
(To vie)

It's you I admire
(To vie)
My living example
It's a photograph discovered a decade after

It's a cannon-blast disguised as a firecracker

It's enough to bring a brick wall to its knees
And sing, please, ooo
Could you move in slow motion?
Everything goes by so fast
Just slow down a little

Save the best part for last
For last
You're an undiscovered
(For last)
Over walls we've trampled
(For last)
It's you I admire
(For last)
My living example
My living example
It's you I admire
My living example
