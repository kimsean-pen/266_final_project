Cut from wire, blind of light, from another breed,
realize wrong from right, turning raw inside of me,
having visions in the sight, like cutting razor wire,
we live on through the night, night of eternal fire.

I never stopped to notice the fire in your hand,
a burning so consuming, but now I understand,
and now I'm falling, like Icarus to land,
too late to kill the flame that I fanned

Wings above, danger's near, they're coming down,
flying close to the sun, you will only hit the ground,
the silence is so deafening, the end is just the beginning,
inside the void, I hear you scream.

I never stopped to notice the fire in your hand,
a burning so consuming, but now I understand,
and now I'm falling, like Icarus to land,
too late to kill the flame that I fanned.

Arise, arise, not so close to the sky.
Alive, alive, when you face death, you feel alive.
Kill it, kill it, channel your animal side.
Fire, fire, it's time to start a riot.

Unleash your wings.
Unleash your soul.
Unleash yourself.
From the sun.

I never stopped to notice the fire in your hand,
a burning so consuming, but now I understand,
and now I'm falling, like Icarus to land,
too late to kill the flame that I fanned.

I never stopped to notice the fire in your hand,
a burning so consuming, but now I understand,
and now I'm falling, like Icarus to land,
too late to kill the flame that I fanned.
