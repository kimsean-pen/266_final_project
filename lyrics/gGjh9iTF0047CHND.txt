I never thought you would be the one,
Cleaning up the mess I'm making
And even if the day has just begun,
I'd really rather wake up when it's dark

And then I try to trick myself,
Like all the others trick themselves
But it's not working anymore

And when I try to take a step ahead,
Leaving all my hopes behind, then
You grab me by my neck and push me down,
Until I lay defenceless on the floor

You couldn't really hurt me more,
And everything you did before
It's all meaningless to me

I always tried the best I could to follow your way
But now it's time to forget ..., it's a good day to forget...
And thoughts drain my head... and the things I can't say...
It's the day to forget you

I never really want this day to end,
But I can't even try to end it
'Cause I was drifting with the sand
That runs right through my hands

Have I ever felt myself?
But why would I torment myself
I'm not running anymore

I always tried the best I could to follow your way
But now it's time to forget ..., it's a good day to forget...
And thoughts drain my head... and the things I can't say...
It's the day to forget you

So I become invisible
And I can stop the world moving beneath my feet
Now I can fall, I am unstoppable
I don't feel like something else, I'm no way incomplete

Have you ever looked beyond my face?
Have you ever tried to read me?
Are you just ignoring what I say?
Is it so hard for you to understand?

You can't trap me anymore,
You can't keep me anymore
I'm casting shadows on your floor

I always tried the best I could to follow your way
But now it's time to forget ..., it's a good day to forget...
And thoughts drain my head... and the things I can't say...
It's the day to forget you

So I become invisible
And I can stop the world moving beneath my feet
Now I can fall, I am unstoppable
I don't feel like something else, I'm no way incomplete

'Cause I become invisible
You won't track me down and you can't cross my way
And I can fall, I am unstoppable
I don't think I can forget a single thing you did

I don't think I can forget a single thing you did
I don't think I can forget a single thing you did

So I become invisible
I become invisible
