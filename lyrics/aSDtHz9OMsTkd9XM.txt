Heavy were the nights
When the fire burnt low
I was moving in circles
Waiting for you to show
Thinking too fast
Trying to breathe slow
Longing for the handle
To turn on the door

And every sign you passed along the way looked twisted and burnt
With messages in languages you'd never seen or heard
But you drove on anyway

And oh, now, all of a sudden you're here
And I can't remember a time when you weren't, it's true
I had to believe that all the signs were arrows pointing you to me

Steady were the wheels
Under every bus
Chasing a horizon
Nobody ever touched
Singing into lights
Questions over chords
Hearing not an answer
But the silence of applause

And every hand I tried to hold would fit there a while
Till one of us grew tired of pretending it felt right
But the emptiness would burn
It's hard to make yourself leave
space for someone that may never emerge

But oh, now, all of a sudden you're here
And I just can't remember a time when you weren't, it's true
I had to believe that all the signs were arrows pointing you to me
They were pointing you to me

Every door that hit my face
Every heady scent I chased
Every oil-slicked mountain road
Every blackened tear that soaked
Every twisted shouted word
Every god I never heard
Every smile he yanked from me
Every light I could not see.

I'm thinking it's true
That all those signs were arrows
Pointing me to you.
