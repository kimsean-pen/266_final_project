I swear by Almighty God
To tell the whole truth
And nothing but the truth

Guns guns, guns guns
Guns guns, guns guns

They torture all the women and children
Then they've put the men to the gun
Cause across the human frontier
Freedom's always on the run

Guns guns shaking in terror
Guns guns killing in error
Guns guns, guilty hands
Guns guns shatter the lands

A system built by the sweat of the many
Creates assassins to kill off the few
Take any place and call it a court house
This is a place where no judge can stand

Sue the lawyers and burn all the papers
Unlock the key of the legal rapers
A jury of a billion faces
Shouted out condemned out of hand

Guns guns, and nobody's kidding
Guns guns, or fooling around
Guns guns, the violence is singing
Guns guns, a silence the sound

And I like to be in Africa
A-beating on the final drum
And I like to be in U.S.S.R.
Making sure these things will come

And I like to be in U.S.A.
Pretending that the wars are done
And I like to be in Europa
Saying goodbye to everyone

Guns guns
There's guns on the roof
Guns guns
They're made to shoot
