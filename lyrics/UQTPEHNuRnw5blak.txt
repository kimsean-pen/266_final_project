I'm a rock from Louisiana
Call me Fox in California
I can look full of confusion
Now I do coke, town of illusions

Sexy clothes and lucky charms
My life fits in a suitcase
No one takes me in his arms

I dance to pay my bills and I fall down the hills
Sad eyes and lace bra, come Fox in California
I dance to pay my bills and I fall down the hills
Sad eyes and lace bra, come Fox in California

High heels, where's Courtney?
The dreamy girl lost in the valley
I still don't know what I'm looking for
But you're not picking up dollars on the floor
Dollars on the floor

I dance to pay my bills and I fall down the hills
Sad eyes and lace bra, come Fox in California
I dance to pay my bills and I fall down the hills
Sad eyes and lace bra, come Fox in California
Sad eyes and lace bra, come Fox in California

I dance to pay my bills and I fall down the hills
Sad eyes and lace bra, come Fox in California
I dance to pay my bills and I fall down the hills
Sad eyes and lace bra, come Fox in California

I dance to pay my bills and I fall down the hills
Sad eyes and lace bra, come Fox in California
I dance to pay my bills and I fall down the hills
Sad eyes and lace bra, come Fox in California
Sad eyes and lace bra, come Fox in California
