These beings are hiding outside of time
Tethering starseeds inside your mind
Rotten seeds grown inside astral beings from beyond
Corrupting your DNA
To make your soul obsolete

Replicating inside thoughts
To make your inner self fall asleep

Caught between the empty fields of time
And dimensions that are lost
To the worlds we know as real
