Shadowing the blinding light
From within our confinement
The hollow stare of thousands pierce the soul

Reject the innate
And no solace will prevail
Our bloodless tower over all
With their eyes full of god
They are blind to our dawn

Scream to the silent masses
Caution to their winds of contempt
Release me
To rise from their ruins

The roots of the mortal
Masked with our atrophy

Born of man, the tyrant
Reborn
