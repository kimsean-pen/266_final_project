Come hear our broken psalms Big words that we wrote while in the dark
We ordered our young To heed our words and bleach their minds And
they obeyed And said their prayers And burnt their wires
Before too long we'd changed our minds
We fell out of love with liquid light And
in our shame We all then failed to disavow Leaving
our plague to trickle down It's gone too far Lennon.
Slick '66, get your trip on Stay in bed,
feed your head Huxleys new dawn Acid fried, '69,
got it so wrong Brian, Syd, Peter, Skip, Roky,
all gone Come listen to the words of dead men And the clinically
insane As they lead you down the path that
they went And encourage you to do the same Wake up
They got it so wrong Still their verses are commonplace
