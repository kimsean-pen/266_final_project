8am is stifling.
Re-acclimate to human.
Alien ways left flittering behind.
Eyes rolled to the sky.
Sex pulled to the sky.
Fears told to the sky.
Had a dream you dissect me, strip me down, make sure I'm clean, but I feel unclean.
Rubber gloves round my skull base.
Peel the skin back.
Reshape my face.
You say I look better this way.
You're in my head and you won't go.
Outer space for you.
Moon's got a face for you.
A white hot blank for you, so go.
Electric tape for you.
Bound arms and legs for you.
I'd waste away for you, so go.
You love me.
You love me not.
I can't bear another boring night.
You disgust me.
You disrupt my every thought.
I bleach my head of you.
My little worm, divide in two.
You want me, now stop.
You want me, now stop.
You love me.
You love me not.
I can't bear another boring night.
You disgust me.
You disrupt my every thought and I want you gone.
