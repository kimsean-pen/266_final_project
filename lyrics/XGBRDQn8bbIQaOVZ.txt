Wasting your days
Chasing some girls, alright
Chasing cocaine through the back rooms
Of the world all night

Wasting your days
Chasing some girls, alright
Chasing cocaine through the back rooms
Of the world all night

Sounds, smash hits, melody maker N-M-E
All sound like a dream to me
All sound like a dream to me
All sounds like a dream

Sounds, smash hits, melody maker N-M-E
All sound like a dream to me
All sound like a dream to me
All sounds like a dream

Step out of your toga and into the fog
You are a prince on the ocean
In the pinch, in the sky, in your eye

Step out of your toga and into the ocean
Look they got your prince on the phone
In the pinch, in the sky, in your eye

In the sky, in your eye
Pinch, in the sky, in your eye

I wrote a song for America, who knew?
