I'm waiting for another day
I'm waiting for the clock to reach the six and twelve
I'm waiting for a holiday
I'm waiting for myself
I'm waiting for another day
I'm waiting for the clock to reach the six and twelve
I'm waiting for a holiday
I'm waiting for myself

And all I seem to hear is
Stop, stop
I'm catching up on you
Don't leave me behind
I can't see a soul out here
It's dark, dark
I'm catching up on you

And all I wonder is
Why? Why don't I try to stop running
Why? What am I running for?

Do you remember why we started running?
Do you remember why we're running at all?
If I dared I'd choose to swim
But it's safer on the shore
Do you remember why we started running?
Do you remember why we're running at all?
I would die to get away
But I fear to even more

I'm waiting for another day
The last one was so desperately disappointing
I can't seem to
Focus on what I've done
Or where I've been
I can see nobody here

And all I seem to hear is
Stop, stop
I'm catching up on you
Don't leave me behind
I can't see a soul out here
It's dark, dark
I'm catching up on you

And all I wonder is
Why? Why don't I try to stop running
Why? What am I running for?

Do you remember why we started running?
Do you remember why we're running at all?
If I dared I'd choose to swim
But it's safer on the shore
Do you remember why we started running?
Do you remember why we're running at all?
I would die to get away
But I fear to even more

I would rather stay here the rest of my life
I would rather stay here the rest of my life
I would rather stay here the rest of my life
Than close my eyes

I would rather stay here the rest of my life
I would rather stay
I would rather stay here the rest of my life
Than close my eyes and start swimming

I would rather stay here the rest of my life
I would rather stay here the rest of my life
I would rather stay here the rest of my life
Than close my eyes and start swimming
Close my eyes and start swimming
Close my eyes and start swimming
