girl you are rich
even with nothing
you know tenderness
comes from pain
it's amazing how you love
and love is kind
and love can give
and get no gain

it's down a rugged road
you've come
though you had every reason you didn't come undone
somehow you made it to
the other side
you didn't suffer in vain

you forgive those who have trespassed against you
and you know tenderness comes from pain
it's amazing how you love
and love is kind
and love can give
and love needs
no gain

it's down a rugged road
you've come
though you had every reason you didn't come undone
somehow you made it to
the other side
you didn't suffer in vain

you didn't suffer in vain
you know it's only love
that gets you through
only love love
only love that gets
you through
