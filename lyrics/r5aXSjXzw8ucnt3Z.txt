Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

Today I'm laughing the clouds away
I hear what the flowers say
Drinking a drop of rain

And I see the places that I have been
A place that I've never seen
My side of the grass is green

Oh I can't believe that it's so simple
It feels so natural to me

If this is love, then love is easy
It's the easiest thing to do
If this is love, then love completes me
Cause it feels like I've been missing you
A simple equation
With no complications to leave you confused
If this is love, love, love
Oh it's the easiest thing to do

Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

Whatever that I do
Do I turn your grey skies blue?
Making the streets look new
And the birds sing
Tweedily tweet dee dee dee
Tweedily dee dee dee
Now we know exactly what they mean

Oh I can't believe that it's so simple
It feels so natural to me

If this is love then love is easy
It's the easiest thing to do
If this is love then love completes me
Cause it feels like I've been missing you
A simple equation
With no complications to leave you confused
If this is love, love, love
Oh it's the easiest thing to do

Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

If this is love then love is easy
It's the easiest thing to do
If this is love then love completes me
Cause it feels like I've been missing you
A simple equation
With no complications to leave you confused
If this is love, love, love
Oh it's the easiest thing to do

Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Oh this is love love love love
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
