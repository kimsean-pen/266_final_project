When you're standing in the dark
And you struggle to find the light
You're just trying to find a way
But you just can't find the time
I'll come for you
you know that I'll save you

Who you gonna call, gonna call
Who you gonna call, gonna call
When you need somebody
When you need someone

Who you gonna call, gonna call
Who you gonna call, gonna call
When you need somebody
When you need someone

When you need somebody
When you need someone
When you need somebody
When you need someone

When the water is just too deep
Getting chosed by the sharks
when the pressure is too just too much
And you feel it in your heart
I'll come for you
You know that I'll save you

Who you gonna call, gonna call
Who you gonna call, gonna call
When you need somebody
When you need someone

Who you gonna call, gonna call
Who you gonna call, gonna call
When you need somebody
When you need someone

When you need somebody
When you need someone
When you need somebody
When you need someone

If you fly
Let me know
I'll be there
I'll be close
It's your fear
Let me know
If this dies, be my ghost

Who you gonna call, gonna call
Who you gonna call, gonna call
When you need somebody
When you need someone

Who you gonna call, gonna call
Who you gonna call, gonna call
When you need somebody
When you need someone

Who you gonna call, gonna call
Who you gonna call, gonna call
When you need somebody
When you need someone

Who you gonna call, gonna call
Who you gonna call, gonna call
When you need somebody
When you need someone

When you need somebody
When you need someone
When you need somebody
When you need someone
