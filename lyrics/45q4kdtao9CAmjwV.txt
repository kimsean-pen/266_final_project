baby I just want you to understand
just exactly how you make me feel

oooh yeah

I wanna feel you next to me

ooooh... time after time, when im feelin low
somethin inside of me lets me know that its alright
loves on my side
when the world... seems a lonely place
i've got a dream that wont leave a trace of blues
I just think of you baby I know

(chorus:)
ive got a real thing here by my side
someone who needs me holding me tight
and these special feelings wont ever fade
cause I knew from the start you put a move on my heart

baby our loves like a melody playing for us
in the sweetest key you could find the music of life
and when we touch theres the warmest glow
heat in the passion that heaven knows its a dream
just for you, you and me... and baby I know

(chorus:)

someone who needs me and he feels me with pride
baby now, now and forever, we'll never part
cause you're the world to me you put a move on my heart

and these, these special feelings, time can embrace
