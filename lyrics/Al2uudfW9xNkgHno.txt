They came at dawn into the morning light
black shadows riding on the mist
Prepered for battle, swords were shining bright
filled with anger and harm
Came to kill not to charm

The sound of metal screaming in the air
the time has come were justice rules
The endless victims looking up in fear
Now, who are the fools

Oh, here they come, riders of the sun
And they will fight... Back To Back

They're fighting hard, their way to victory
dead bodies lying on the ground
They are the soldiers of eternity
and their swords spinning around

Oh, here they come, riders of the sun
And they will fight... Back To Back

Kill with power, ready to ride, let's go

They got it all, they'll never fall
But they will fight

The night is falling, light will disappear
a magic silence fills the place
Could read the warning, shining crystal clear
now they were lost for the chase

Oh, here they come, riders of the sun
And they will fight... Back To Back

No, no, no, no
