instrumental

Time moves like Spiders
Over the face of the clock
Time's forward violence
Eating away at the heart

Another hour's past
They never seem to last
Another day goes by
No matter how I try
I've come to hate all clocks
How every second knocks
I wish I could reverse
This quaint arachnid hearse

I can't stand the spiders
I can't bare their crawl

The clock is ticking
'Til the point of no return
It'll keep on ticking
'Til the day you crash and burn

Time's web of severance
Where all remain until dark
Heads facing backwards
Like marionettes on a stalk
