All the silhouettes of passers-by
The sound of streets and familiar cries
Will vanish into the illusion
No serenity and never compromise
There's no dignity as you fraternize

With your delusions, so set me free
Take all you need, don't believe
Together we're jaded and now we're enervated

Wings ablaze, I'm burning the wreckage of my life
I nosedive to the furnace
Set fire to the stars at night
They got me this far
The judgement now begins
I'm bleeding from the inside

Vanishing into thin air
My body hits the floor
Much slower than before

Crisis, man overboard
Emergency abort
I watch them dancing

Oh, the fireflies of war gather
Oh, the damage that's been done
Paid for

Won't you reveal yourself to me?
As I rise above the deep
Won't you reveal yourself to me?
Oh

Oh, the fireflies above gather
Oh, the damage that's been done
Paid for

Now won't you save yourself from me?
Won't you save yourself from me?
Help
