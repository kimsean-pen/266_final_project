We have a little tune that we always
play for the ladies
I've got that words
I've got that tune
I've been rehearsing under the moon
But I got nobody to hear my song
So I'm hummin' to myself
I've got the place
I've got the time
I've got a lot of love words that rhyme
But I got nobody to hear my song
So I'm hummin' to myself
Nobody to hear my song
Nobody to hear my song but I
Nobody nobody nobody
To hear my song but I
Nobody nobody nobody
To hear my song but I
Nobody nobody nobody
I got that tune on
Nobody nobody nobody
To hear my song
I guess it just had to be
Nobody nobody nobody
I got that tune on
Nobody nobody
I got that tune on
Oh oh in my bedroom
I got that tune on
Nobody to hear my song
I got that there I got that tune on
I got that there I got that tune on
I got that tune on
Won't someone listen to me
Nobody to hear my song
I got that tune on
I'm in my bedroom
Nobody nobody nobody
To hear my song
Nobody nobody nobody
To hear my song but I
Nobody nobody nobody
To hear my song
Nobody nobody nobody
To hear my song
Nobody nobody nobody
To hear my song
I got that tune on
Nobody to hear my song
Oh oh in my bedroom
Nobody to hear my song
I got that tune on
Nobody to hear my song
Oh oh in my bedroom
Well I got the words and I got the tune
And I'd like to croon it under the moon
But I got nobody to hear my song
So I'm hummin' to myself
