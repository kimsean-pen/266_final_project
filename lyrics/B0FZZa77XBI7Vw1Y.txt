I went to the desert,
because I wanted to find my pistol.
I wanted to see what it would feel like to be invincible.
But a man I met said, boy you ain't seen nothing yet.
Let me take for a ride.

So I got in his truck and he took me to the mustang range.
I paid my 40 bucks to the girl at the window pane.
under the cover of darkness and behind my disguise
she said kid won't you come inside?

She said,
Don't you worry I won't tell anybody about it,
You can do what you like until the morning light,
I can be who you want me to be.

Don't you worry ya sweet little head about it.

I'll have you in bed you know you'll have me back
You can have me there, but then you had me at hello.

I want you to love as if you got no principles,
I want you to love me as if love is invincible.
Under the cover of darkness and behind my disguise
I could tell she could see my eyes.

You had me on the kitchen floor, you had me on the bed.
You had me by the nick on the rug with the tiger's head.
You had me fast, you had me slow.

You had me on the pillow where you lie at night and dream,
You had me dressing up in your Alexander McQueens.
You had me till they make me go.
You had me at hello.

She said,
Don't you worry I won't tell anybody about it,
You can do what you like until the morning light,
I can be who you want me to be.

I want you to love me, so don't feel sorry about it,
I can hold you tight, through the lonely night.
I can be who you want me to be.

Don't you worry ya sweet little head about it.
I'll have you in bed you know you'll have me back
You can have me then but then I'll have you back.
You can have me there, but then you had me at hello.
