You push me to go the extra mile
You push me when it's difficult to smile

You push me, a better version of myself
You push me, only you and no one else
You push me to see the other point of view
You push me when there's nothing else to do
You push me when I think I know it all
You push me when I stumble and I fall
Keep on pushin'
Like nobody
Every place I live, every mood I'm in
Everything I do, I owe it all to you
Every move I make, every step I take
Every thing I know, it's all because you push me
You push me when I don't appreciate
You push me not to lie and not to hate
You push me when I want it all to end
You push me when I really need a friend

You push me, all I wanna do is cry
You push me when it's time for me to try

You push me when I do it for myself
You push me, only you and no one else
Keep on pushin'
Like nobody
Every place I live, every mood I'm in
Everything I do, I owe it all to you
Every move I make, every step I take

Every thing I do, it's all because you push me
You push me
Keep on pushin'
Like nobody
Keep on
Keep on
Every place I live
(To go the extra mile)
Every mood I'm in
(When it's difficult to smile)
Everything I do
(A better version of myself)
(Only you and only you and only you)
Every move I make
(To see the other point of view)
Every step I take

(When there's nothing else to do)
Every thing I do

(I think I know it all)
(Only you and only you and only you)
Every place I live
(To go the extra mile)
Every mood I'm in
(When it's difficult to smile)
Everything I do

(A better version of myself)
I owe it all to you
(Only you and only you and only you)

Every move I make
(To see the other point of view)
Every step I take
(When there's nothing else to do)
Every thing I do
(I think I know it all)
It's all because you push me
You push me
