I don't know east texas from louisiana.
and i don't know alabama or where atlanta lies tonight.
and indianapolis.
summers in park and recreation pools,
and carsick vacations in size eleven in "i'm going to heaven" shoes.
i don't know god;
i don't know anyone or if anything will be all right.
like i don't know billy ocean from the ocean floor.
i don't own any albums, i don't know anything.
i don't go to college anymore.
i've got my hands on the one hand,
but i don't know where to put them.
but on the other hand,
i don't know if i'll talk my way out of this one tonight.
