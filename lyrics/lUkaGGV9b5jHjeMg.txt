Don't give in
Don't you dare quit so easy
Give all
That you got on the sword
Don't say
That you won't live forever I know, I know

It's in your blood and it's and it's in your making
So don't hold your tongue cause it's no longer working
Don't fall on your sword just follow your instinct
Like an old lesson learned
Like an old lesson learned

Only you know what it
What it is to see through
See through the eyes that are trained on me now
I can, I can only tell you how it, how it looks from here
I think you've made up your mind
I think you've made up your mind

Don't give in
Don't you dare quit so easy
Give all
That you got on the sword
Don't say
That you won't live forever I know

Don't give in
Don't you dare quit so easy
Give all
That you got on the sword
Don't say
That you won't live forever I know

Yes there's a lot we can, we can learn from this loss
Learn not to let it fall around our ears
Don't fall in love with the
With the way things were
It'll fuck up your mind
It'll fuck up your mind

But this is all
On the wings of others
But I loved you more
More in your own flight
So it ain't the same
It won't be lost forever
It won't be lost forever

Don't give in
Don't you dare quit so easy
Give all
That you got on the sword
Don't say
That you won't live forever I know, I know

Don't give in
Don't you dare quit so easy
Give all
That you got on the sword
Don't say
That you won't live forever I know, I know

This is your grace and I don't know why, and I don't know why
This is your grace and I don't know why, and I don't know why

Don't give in
Don't you dare quit so easy
Give all
That you got on the sword
Don't say
That you won't live forever I know, I know
