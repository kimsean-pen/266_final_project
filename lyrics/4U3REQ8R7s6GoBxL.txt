It's so far gone you can't see it if you're squinting
But still talk about it half of the day
When it's hurting close the curtains
You've got to feel it but you don't got to say
You've got to feel it but you don't got to say

Nine hours of mourning in the milky way
Her flat's got curtains and a mezzanine
I guess it's going to waste
And as the feeling fades
You couldn't give it away
Better it's going to waste

It's so far gone that it's barely in the
background like I left the TV playing again
Something different steals the picture
but I just pull myself back to it again
When it's hurting keep it hurting
And I can prove how much I care till it fades

Nne hours of mourning in the milky way
Her flat's got curtains and a mezzanine
I guess it's going to waste
And as the feeling fades
You couldn't give it away
Better it's going to waste

Nine hours of mourning in the milky way
Her flat's got curtains and a mezzanine

I guess it's going to waste
And as the feeling fades
I couldn't give it away
Better it's going to waste
But I guess it's going to waste
And as the feeling fades
I couldn't give it away
I guess it's going to waste
Better it's going to waste
Better it's going to waste
Better it's going to waste
