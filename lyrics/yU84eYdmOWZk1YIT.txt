I know it, I know it, I know it
I know it, I know it, I know it
I know it, I know it, I know it
Alright

Everybody in the building disappear
That's the way you looking at me
Whispering silly nothings in my ear
Careful now, this could get ugly

All night, I give you all my dirty crime
I bet you never had imagined she could be so mean

Careful what you're doing, 'cause if I decide to bite
Bitches know I make the boys go zombie all the time
They say I'm an animal, they all have read it
You don't wanna fuck with me
Leavin' no survivors if you don't believe the hype
Bitches know I make the boys go zombie all the time
They say I'm an animal and you'll regret it
You don't wanna fuck with me

Nothing can kill my swagger once it's on
I eat boys like you for breakfast
I really like you, too, don't get me wrong
That's why you should make an exit

All night, I give you all my dirty crime
I bet you never had imagined she could be so mean

Careful what you're doing, 'cause if I decide to bite
Bitches know I make the boys go zombie all the time
They say I'm an animal and they all had read it
You don't wanna fuck with me
Leavin' no survivors if you don't believe the hype
Bitches know I make the boys go zombie all the time
They say I'm an animal and you'll regret it
You don't wanna fuck with me

You don't want this kiss, you don't want this touch
Better not come crying when it's all too much
See, you don't wanna text me 'cause I won't write back
If you want this Queen, better be Batman
I'm a strong female and I don't play nice
Only one I know that has hit this twice
And it crumbled quick in the morning light
There was nothing left but Ciroc and Sprite
Oh, doesn't that sound nice?
If you want the best, you can pay this price

Careful what you're doing, 'cause if I decide to bite
Bitches know I make the boys go zombie all the time
They say I'm an animal, they all have read it
You don't wanna fuck with me
Leavin' no survivors if you don't believe the hype
Bitches know I make the boys go zombie all the time
They say I'm an animal and you'll regret it
You don't wanna fuck with me

I know it, I know it, I know it
I know it, I know it, I know it
I know it, I know it, I know it
Alright
