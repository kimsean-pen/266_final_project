I don't know
Why you met me
And cannot cry
But you won't turn around
To see me fly
All you know
Is when I'm with you
I make you see
I'm nothing but another
Fish in the sea

I'm saying
Swallow me
Everything is alright
Ill be the one
Who keeps you up at night
And if you leave
I can guarantee
You will find 10 million
Guys like me

I'm not worried
It's his ring you wear
As long as noone knows
Then he can't even care
You're feeling guilty
I'm well aware
You look so ashamed
And baby I'm so scared

I'm saying
Swallow me
Everything is alright
Ill be the one
Who keeps you up at night
And if you leave
I can guarantee
You will find 10 million
Guys like me

I'll pay you money
If you go see this guy
He's better off
Cos he won't ask why
I'm the real reason
That you went astray
Well be alright
If you don't
Want me to stay

I'm saying
Swallow me
Everything is alright
Ill be the one
Who keeps you up at night
And if you leave
I can guarantee
You will find 10 million
Guys like me

I don't know
Why you met me
And cannot cry
But you won't turn around
To see me fly
All you know
Is when I'm with you
I make you see
I'm nothing but another
Fish in the sea

I'm saying
Swallow me
Everything is alright
Ill be the one
Who keeps you up at night
And if you leave
I can guarantee
You will find 10 million
