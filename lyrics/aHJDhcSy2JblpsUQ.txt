Wake up Maggie
I think I got something to say to you
It's late September and I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used

Oh Maggie

I couldn't have tried anymore.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts.
The morning sun
When it's in your face
Really shows your age
But that don't worry me none
In my eyes you're everything.

I laughed at all of your jokes

My love you didn't need to coax
Oh Maggie

I couldn't have tried anymore.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul
That's a pain I can do without.
All I needed was a friend, to lend, a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover
And Mother what a lover
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie
I couldn't have tried anymore.
You led me away from home
'cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart
I couldn't leave you if I tried.
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock and roll band, that needs a helpin' hand.
Oh Maggie
I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway.
Maggie
I wished I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home, one of these days
