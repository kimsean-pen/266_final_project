Centuries
I respect them, please
Come on

I know now
But it isn't easy
And I transform, into energy
With your mouth

Let them fly
Movement overflows
Come on

I know now
But it isn't easy
And I transform, into energy
With your mouth

Let them fly
The rest is like a cup of tea
And I transform, into energy
With your mouth

Energy (x7)
I transform, into energy (x4)
With your mouth

I know now
But it isn't easy
And I transform, into energy
With your mouth
