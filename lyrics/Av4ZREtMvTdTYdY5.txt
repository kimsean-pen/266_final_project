People say we've got it made
Don't they know we're so afraid?
Isolation
We're afraid to be alone
Everybody's got to have a home
Isolation
Just a boy and a little girl
Trying to change the whole wide world
Isolation
The world is just a little town
Everybody trying to put us down
Isolation
Isolation
I don't expect you
To understand
After you've caused
So much pain
But then again
You're not to blame
You're just a human
A victim of the insane

We're afraid of everyone
We're afraid of the sun
Isolation
The sun will never disappear
But the world may not have many years
Isolation
Isolation
