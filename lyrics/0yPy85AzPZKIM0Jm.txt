What you got? What you got?
What you got? What you got?

I'm lookin' around tryin' to find me one original thing
'Cause I've been walkin' so long
It feels just like the sales are gonna break

But everyone's lookin' at TV screens
At wannabes who just imitate
But I don't wanna be that way

You think you never eat words
Just wanna hear yourself talk
But when the cameras are off
You don't say nothing at all

I'm searchin' both the time
And sittin' it by on the stones
I need

One original thing
Baby, I need an original thing
Something unusual to give me some wings
Show me one, true original thing

What you got? What you got?
What you got? What you got?
What you got? What you got?
What you got? What you got?

I'm flippin' through channels
But I'm still flipping thoughts in my mind
How could it be that something
So sweet is so hard to find

It seems like everyone's tryin' to be
A model in a magazine
It"s no ride, no, it's just not right

You wanna talk about love
You're too whip out your head
You wanna be at the top
You gotta learn how to stand

You're lookin' both for me
And lookin' for somebody who knows
I need

One original thing
Baby, I need an original thing
Something unusual to give me some wings
Show me one, true original thing

What you got? What you got?
What you got? What you got?
What you got? What you got?
What you got? What you got?

Something original
Something original
Original

I need one original thing
Show me one true original thing
I need one original thing
Baby, I need an original thing

Something, I'm beautiful
To give me some wings
Show me one, true original thing

What you got? What you got?
What you got? What you got?

What you got?
