Freedom and blood
I make my mark and fight for tomorrow
Finally I've got something
Something I can raise my voice for
Fine, tell them who you really want
Fine, well you'll get yours and I'll get mine

Proud
I'm proud to be, proud to see
They said, proud
I'm proud to be, I'm proud to be me
They said tell me
Oh, you've got to tell me

Freedom's rough
So we take our stand and fight for tomorrow
Finally we got something
Something we can bring down the house with
Fine, tell them who you think you are
Fine, well tell them fine is what you are

Proud
I'm proud to be, proud to see
They said, proud
I'm proud to be, I'm proud to be me
They said tell me
Oh, you'd better tell me

And when you finally figure out what it is you need
You better think of me
Think of me

No no
No no
[repeats]

I get up
I feel the rhythm in my fingers
I get up
I hear the rhythm in my laughter
Take a second look
You might find that I am stronger
Take a second look
You might find that you are stronger

Imagination, inspiration
It's only fair that I tell you
I plan on leaving here tonight
With my pride
(Gets me every time)
With my pride
(Gets me every time)
With my pride
I'm proud to be, I'm proud to be me
With my pride
I'm proud to be, I'm proud to be me
