Love, you're fucked
I mean it I grieved enough
To preach it
One too many times
Leaving me dry
Just my luck
I'm an idiot
Give my touch
Never getting it right
Its an empty sacrifice

It's a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely lonely, lonely way to drive
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely lonely, lonely way to drive

Now I can see, this wasn't enough
I was just wasting my nights on
This sinking timebomb
And me, I couldn't keep up
So I draw back, disconnect
Baby you just take all my love

Seems you're stuck
Spinning with your eyes wide shut
Just hoping that time
Hands you a sign

It's a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely lonely, lonely way to drive
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely lonely, lonely way to drive

Now I can see, this wasn't enough
I was just wasting my nights on
This sinking timebomb
And me, I couldn't keep up
So I draw back, disconnect
Baby you just take all my love

But your touch I still feel
When I'm numb
But the rush wasn't real
Cuz you give it away to anyone

Now I can see, this wasn't enough
I was just wasting my nights on
This sinking timebomb
And me, I couldn't keep up
So I draw back, disconnect
Baby you just take all my love
