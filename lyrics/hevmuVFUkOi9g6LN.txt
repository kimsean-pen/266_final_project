I tried to be the one that everybody loved
Where has that gotten me?
I tear my self to shreds to prove that I'm someone
That I could never be

Now these unslightly marks define me

So help me, please someone come quick
I think I am losing it
Forgive me, I inherited this
From a stranger I'll never miss
I'm sick

My father taught me first hand how to be set free
Give up and run away
I wish I could drain out his half of blood in me
But I'd still have his face

I curse reflections every day

So help me, please someone come quick
I think I am losing it
Forgive me, I inherited this
From a stranger I'll never miss

Here is my own family tradition
Following footsteps into addiction so

Is there a way
That I can find peace
While still numbing my pain?

Is this my fate?
Cause your only son still
Can't seem to find his way

So help me, please someone come quick
I think I am losing it
Forgive me, I inherited this
From a stranger I'll never miss
So father, where the hell are you now?
I think that you would be proud
Your son who's so unluckily
Fell right next to the tree
I hope you're proud of me
I hope you're proud
