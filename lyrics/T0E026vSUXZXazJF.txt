Thought I ran into you down on the street
Then it turned out to only be a dream
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away, and then I took a different path

I remember the face, but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how what's 'er name has been

Seems that she disappeared without a trace
Did she ever marry old what's his face?
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away, and then I took a different path

I remember the face, but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how what's 'er name has been

Remember, whatever, it seems like forever ago
Remember, whatever, it seems like forever ago

The regrets are useless in my mind, she's in my head
I must confess
The regrets are useless in my mind, she's in my head
From so long ago

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go

And in the darkest night
If my memory serves me right
I'll never turn back time
Forgetting you but not the time
