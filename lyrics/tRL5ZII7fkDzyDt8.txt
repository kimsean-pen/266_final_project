Right from the get go
Right from the get go

Backseat driver of my life
Always tells me what to do
I knew this from the very first
Moment that I saw you

Backseat driver of my life
Don't speak no conversation
She shows me
She controls me

I'm about to lose my mind (Click click click click bang)
This bitch never understand
I'm about to pay the price
Even though I knew it right

Right from the get go
Right from the get go
You and me
The flowers in the get go
Right from the get go

I'm sorry, this might seem rude
But I'm gonna tell it to the crowd
People jumping up and down
Yeah, the girls are getting wild
Hey ho, set aside
To me it's no surprise
This is my everyday life
I've been using you
Alalalala long time
You've got your story, I got mine
Got two friends I left behind
Just to say that you are mine
I got new friends to make
Or new enemies in this timeline

Backseat driver of my life
Always told me what to do
I'm sorry if I ever hurt you

Right from the get go
Right from the get go
You and me
The flowers in the get go
Right from the get go
