Complex
Priestess
Come down

Contact
Reach us
Go wild

I've chased your name
I've sailed all through space
Watch this
Come down
Teach us
The ropes

Your contact
It keeps us provoked
Remove your veil
Let me light you up
I'm on your team
Let's go

Face to face, light stare
My custom made nightmares
Armed with teeth in fashion
Now all we need is action

Complex
Priestess
Come down

Our contact
Reach us
Go wild

Remove your veil, every last one
I'm on your team
I'm the antidote
The rocket's taking off
Tonight,
It's time

Take me
I'll light you up
Take me
UP! (Evil scream)
