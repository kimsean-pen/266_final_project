Beautiful shimmering light
Bursting through the trees
Beckoning me forward
Into woods I have not seen

Don't look down, that's what they say
But these cracks say they know me

If I'd known, I'd have been
A different person

I wouldn't be covered in scars
Or I wouldn't have to show them

I wouldn't show my scars
I could move on with life

Without straying I follow on
Never looking back
My life laid out before me
As I walk between the cracks

The dark is full of wonder
As it creeps to shroud the light
But it doesn't have the strength
To beat me as I fight

This never-ending battle
Of me against myself
Live to fight another day
Or stand and face this hell

Shimmering light
