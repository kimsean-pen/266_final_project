When do you know
You know you learn
D'you die in sin
Born again
With will to wind & wander
Climb through needle neck to consent

When do you know
You know you learn
Arrive at spring once again
And still to rise beyond the tide

And mortal track
Fretful or fair
By straw
By strap
Toughening
Tear
Dust to dust
Consume
For what is worth upon me
Nascent
Naissant
