I'll be the grapes fermented, bottled and served with the table set
In my finest suit, like a perfect gentleman
I'll be the fire escape that's bolted to the ancient brick
Where you will sit and contemplate your day

I'll be the waterwings that save you if you start drowning in
An open tab when your judgment's on the brink.
I'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite
Albums back as you're lying there
Drifting off to sleep (drifting off to sleep)

I'll be the platform shoes, undo what heredity's done to you
You won't have to strain to look into my eyes
I'll be your winter coat, buttoned and zipped straight to the throat
With the collar up so you won't catch a cold

I want to take you far from the cynics in this town
And kiss you on the mouth
We'll cut our bodies free from the tethers of this scene
Start a brand new colony
Where everything will change, we'll give ourselves new names
Identities erased
The sun will heat the grounds under our bare feet
In this brand new colony (in this brand new colony)

Everything will change, ooh
Everything will change, ooh
Everything will change, ooh
