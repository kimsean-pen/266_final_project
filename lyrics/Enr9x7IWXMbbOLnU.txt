-Mad, mad, mad-
I, I can't get this memories out of my mind
And some kind of madness
Has started to evolve
I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness
Is swallowing me whole
I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realised
What you mean
And now, I need to know if it's real love
Or is it just madness
Keeping us afloat
And when I look back
At all the crazy fights we had
It's like some kind of madness
Was taking control
And now I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realised
What you need
-Mad, mad, mad-
And now I have finally seen the end
-I have seen the end-
I'm, I'm expecting you to care
-Expecting you to care-
I, I have finally seen the light
-Have finally seen the light-
And I have finally realised
-Realised-
I need to love
I need to love
Come to me
Trust in your dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes I know, I can't be wrong
Baby, you're too headstrong
Our love is...
-Mad, mad, mad-
