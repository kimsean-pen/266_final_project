Honey, the stars keep on calling my name
But don't worry, i've told you again and again
When i'm down, you're always the first one to know
Skipping town, i'll take you wherever i go

And i just wanna go
I just wanna go

Honey, this town's really taking its toll
But don't worry, i'm all through with feeling this old
When i'm down, you're always the first on my mind
Skipping town, let's get out and see what we find

'Cause i just wanna go
I just wanna go
I just wanna go
I just wanna go
