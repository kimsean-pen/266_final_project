I wish, I wish,
I wish she'd break your heart
Like you did to me
I hope you're unhappy

And I hope, I hope,
I hope she gives you a disease
So that you will see
But not enough to make you die

But only make you cry
Like you did me

I pray, I pray,
I pray your new baby is a boy
Please don't have a girl
Cause you'll give that woman the world

And I hope I hope
I hope she spends all of your money
Hope she makes you pay
But not enough that you can't survive

But only make you cry
Like you did me

Oh baby, oh oh baby I can hardly wait to see your face
Oh baby, oh oh baby heart break is gonna be the case
I hope she creeps on you with somebody who's 22
I swear to god I'm gonna be laughing at you, every day

I wish, I wish,
I wish she'd break your heart
Like you did to me
I hope you're unhappy

And I pray, I pray,
I pray she brings you to your knees
So you'll come back to me
I really don't want to see you die

But only make you cry
Like you did me
