I am living hand up to my mouth
You put the east into my west and the north into my south
It's very telling only goes to show
You're defined by the list of the people that you know

You need the truth only hear it half the time
Need the keys to the lock to unlock all that is mine
You got no reason I hear no rhyme
Everybody feels the same

You're in love by default
You don't know what's what
You don't know what real
You don't know what's hot
Reality can't and won't bite in the bubble
Life is so good you're in all kinds of trouble
In love by default
That is all you know
That is all you care for
That is all you show
In love by default
But it's not your fault
If everybody feels the same
You're in love by default

What do you want
Your sisters got less and your brothers got more
Here from the curtain to the encore
Can't tell you how to live
I'm just saying what I saw

So this is how it feels to never have a home
You surround yourself with people
But you're never more alone
Call it in baby but you're missing half the tone
Everybody feels the same

You're in love by default
You don't know what's what
You don't know what real
You don't know what's hot
Reality can't and won't bite in the bubble
Life is so good you're in all kinds of trouble
In love by default
That is all you know
That is all you care for
That is all you show
In love by default
But it's not your fault
If everybody feels the same
You're in love by default

Here from the curtain to the encore
Here from the curtain to the encore
You're in love by default
You don't know what's what
You don't know what real
You don't know what's hot
Reality can't and won't bite in the bubble
Life is so good you're in all kinds of trouble
In love by default
That is all you know
That is all you care for
That is all you show
In love by default
But it's not your fault
If everybody feels the same
You're in love by default
