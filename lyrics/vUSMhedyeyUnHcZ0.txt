Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi

Four shadows ring lifeless from guardians of time
Banished from heaven
Etched into dimensionless slime
Four shapes (???)
Perched on the pillars of stocks setting loose on the glass

There in the afterglow
Keep your eyes on the dream
In the theater of endless reform
Between what's to come and what always is and shall not be

In the night
Only darkness in the night
Things that go bump in the night
Only darkness sinks at night
Only darkness in the night
Things that go bump in the night

Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi

Four shadows eclipsing the rays of the sun
Blacker than black, girl
Is that overlapping the sky
Four shadows into dimensionless sleep
Nothing to touch when the movie projector is me

In very vertigo
Don't believe what you see
Through the eyelids of sin, we did fall
And between what's to come

In the night
Only darkness in the night
Things that go bump in the night
Only darkness sinks at night
Only darkness in the night
Things that go bump in the night

Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi
