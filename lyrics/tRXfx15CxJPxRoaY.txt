I say cool, oh cool Cool, Rasta, cool Sit up and meditate
No time to contemplate Cool, oh cool Rasta no fool
Now that you wear your Dreads
Let no badness come into your head
Even though we don't know When our next bread is coming
Step by step we will go Knowing Jah Jah is before I
Cool, oh cool Cool, Rasta, cool
Sit up and meditate
No time to contemplate
Cool, oh cool Cause Rasta no fool
And when you wear your Dreads
Let no badness come into your head
Cause rocky roads we know
Rasta man a liver
So step by step we'll go, we'll go Jah Jah is the forgiver
I say cool, oh cool Cool, Rasta, cool
Sit up and meditate
No time to contemplate
Oh cool, oh cool Cause Rasta no fool
And when you wear your Dreads
Let no badness come into your head
