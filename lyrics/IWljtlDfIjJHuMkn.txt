And I swear there's a ghost on this island
And his hands, all covered in blood
And my wife inquired of understanding
But of course, my dear, you can't
She said: "How can I relate
To somebody who doesn't speak?
I feel like I'm just treading water.
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?"

Well, he comes and he goes, so capricious
And his work appears so rushed
Well, I love the house that we live in
And I love you all too much

Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?

Well, the criminals and liars
Keep them in your cells as a privilege of mine
And I love the house that we live in
And I love you all too much
