It's funny how they blame the south when they weak shit don't blow up (don't blow up)
We came with all the funk while niggas act like they don't know us

Nigga, retire, nigga, catch up with the time, I can see more than the block
I can see more than your spot, I don't be stuck in the past, homie, I'm puffing
The grass, holding my cup like a strap, look at my southerner ass

Niggas try to tell you what you want (what you want)
But niggas rarely give you what you need (what you need)
Ay, bitch, I came right here with the bounce (with the bounce)
And if that ain't enough I got some weed (weed)

Quiet, I be in living room, cuh, nigga shaded
With my Nia Long, I sing her a song, she masturbating
Then bring me alone, she got something to say like Larry David
But I leave her lone, ho, I gotta go, I got a baby (hey hey)
Stuck in Babylon, niggas carry bombs and carry rabies (hey hey)
Who gon' speak for you? Who gon' sing your song if you don't play this? (hey hey)
I got stress for days, picture you go home and you that nigga (hey hey)
But can't pay your bill, you can't buy no diapers for your little one
Don't you pay for thrill, child support is like a check away (hey)
How you chill with Kendrick? Do you smoke with Q and Dr. Dre? (Dre)
Least today is real, I should ask some groupie for some face (face)
Just a stepping stone, least them kind of bitches know their place (place)
This my second home, this where favorite rappers get replaced (placed)
This what the niggas from the South gon' kill that, doubt it, bring the bass (bass)
Bitch, I came here right here with an ounce (with an ounce)
And if that ain't enough you gotta leave (yeah)

Niggas try to tell you what you want (what you want)
But niggas rarely give you what you need (what you need)
Ay, bitch, I came right here with the bounce (with the bounce)
And if that ain't enough I got some weed (weed)
