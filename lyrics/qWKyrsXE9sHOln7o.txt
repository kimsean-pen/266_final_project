The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasnt a bit concerned
For from histry I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned

They all laughed at christopher columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when edison recorded sound
They all laughed at wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly

They told marconi
Wireless was a phony
Its the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now theyll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
But ho, ho, ho!
Whos got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at rockefeller center
Now theyre fighting to get in
They all laughed at whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed at fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his lizzie
Kept the laughers busy
Thats how people are
They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, "hello, goodbye."
But oh, you came through
Now theyre eating humble pie

They all said wed never get together
Darling, lets take a bow
For ho, ho, ho!
Whos got the last laugh?
Hee, hee, hee!
Lets at the past laugh
Ha, ha, ha!
Whos got the last laugh now? "
