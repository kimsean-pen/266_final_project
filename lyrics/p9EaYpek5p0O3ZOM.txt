People like to talk
But I can't understand a word
They threw us to the wolves
But I can't say I'm stronger now
My back's against the wall
I'm drifting door to door
No I can't rest
We just lay awake
But tell me now is that just one big
Stupid mistake
Cause I can't get you off my mind
I'm drifting day to day
I just lay awake

No I can't sleep
I close my eyes

And you are here
With me tonight
In another world
Oh I know, I know, I know that
You would be my girl
And nothing would tear us apart
Another universe
The stars would light the way for just the two of us
And nothing would tear us apart
Oh-woah, in another world
Oh-woah, just the two of us
Oh-woah

A special place in time
I'll put it in a bottle

I'd go back there in my mind
I'm up above the clouds 'til I come
Crashing back to earth
Cause I know this can't work
Cause when it hurts
I close my eyes
And you are here

With me tonight
Tonight
In another world
Oh I know, I know, I know that
You would be my girl
And nothing would tear us apart

Another universe
The stars would light the way for just the two of us
And nothing would tear us apart
Oh-woah, in another world

Oh-woah, just the two of us
Oh-woah
And nothing would tear us apart
I just close my eyes
And you're here with me tonight
And nothing would tear us apart
I just close my eyes
Can't get you off my mind.
And nothing would tear us apart
In another world
Stars would light the way for just the two of us
And nothing would tear us apart
