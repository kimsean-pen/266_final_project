The cold concrete cuts against her back
And her spirit spills with blood onto the pavement
Hands tied so tight behind her neck
And a silence falls, and everything changes
Everything dies, to you nothing's alive, to you anymore
I guess you've gotten more than you may have wanted

If I could take your pain away
I would scream for you
And I'd bleed for you
So you'll never feel this way again
When you're in my arms, again
I would scream for you
I will bleed for you

She drowns herself until the images erase
But the skin is bruised all along her thighs
Nightmares repeat refrain the memories remain
The mental photographs haunting all the time
She shuts her eyes, to you she tries to hide
From you, she falls asleep into dreams where she is safe

If I could take your pain away
I would scream for you
And I'd bleed for you
So you'll never feel this way again
When you're in my arms, again
I would scream for you
I will bleed for you
Put the weight on my shoulders
And the pain in my heart
Tie the knots in my stomach, let it tear me apart
So I could be everything you need

Put the weight on my shoulders
And the pain in my heart
Tie the knots in my stomach, let it tear me apart
So tear me apart

Where the silence strips me bare
And your body pins me down
I've never been so scared to breathe
Afraid to make a sound
But all I know is you'll never let me go
Just kick and scream, bite and bleed,
and make believe it's all a dream

If I could take your pain away
I would scream for you
And I'd bleed for you
So you'll never feel this way again
When you're in my arms, again
I would scream for you
I will bleed for you
Pain away
I would scream for you
I will bleed for you
Pain away
I will bleed for you
