Everybody's asking me to stay
But I don't like it here
It makes me feel so weird
Now they're all wishing I would leave
But I kinda wanna stay
You make it seem okay
But how I always lose my mind
When I'm in one place for long time
But how I always lose my mind
When I'm in one place for long time
Now it's getting closer, time to go
But I feel so slow
I wonder if it shows
If only there was something I could do
To make it easier on you
I know what you've been through
But how I always lose my mind
When I'm in one place for long time
I miss you lots when I go away
I miss you lots, do you want me to stay?
Though I don't like it here
Call me up if you want me
I'll be around for a couple more days
But it doesn't matter wherever I go
I'll come running if you let me know
I know I'm gonna miss you
I know, I know
I know I'm gonna miss you one day
I know, I know
