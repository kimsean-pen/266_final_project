Only, only for a second now
Only, night will make it real now
Floating, and I can't control myself

Feels like when you were young
Those moments are taking you now
Ohh

Calypso Beach you're holding me
and I'm swimming in circles in circles

Calypso Beach you're holding me
and I'm swimming in circles in circles

Outlines, changing as I look around and realise
Everything is perfect now
Let myself sink within

Feels like when you were young
Those moments are taking you now
Ohh

Calypso Beach you're holding me
and I'm swimming in circles in circles

Calypso Beach you're holding me
and I'm swimming in circles in circles

Calypso Beach you're holding me
and I'm swimming in circles in circles

Calypso Beach you're holding me
and I'm swimming in circles in circles
