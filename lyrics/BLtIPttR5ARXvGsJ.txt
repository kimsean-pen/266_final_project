Fifteen years in the academy
He was like no cadet they'd ever seen
A man so hard, his veins bleed ice
And when he speaks he never says it twice
They call him Judge, his last name is Dredd
Break the law and you wind up dead
Truth and justice are what he's fighting for
Judge Dredd the man, he is the law
DROKK IT!

With gun and bike he rules the streets
And every perp he meets will taste defeat
Not even Death can overcome his might
Cause Dredd and Anderson they won the fight
When the Sovs started the Apocalypse war
Mega-City was bombed to the floor
Dredd resisted and the judges fought back
Crushed the Sovs with their counter-attack

DROKK IT!

Respect the badge - he earned it with his blood
Fear the gun - your sentence may be death because...

I AM THE LAW!
And you won't fuck around no more - I AM THE LAW!

I judge the rich, I judge the poor - I AM THE LAW!
Commit a crime I'll lock the door - I AM THE LAW!
Because in Mega-City I AM THE LAW!

In the cursed earth where mutants dwell
There is no law just a living hell
Anarchy and chaos as the blood runs red
But this would change if it was up to Dredd
The book of law is the bible to him

And any crime committed is a sin
He keeps the peace with his law-giver
Judge, jury, and executioner
DROKK IT!

Respect the badge - he earned it with his blood
Fear the gun - your sentence may be death because...
I AM THE LAW!
And you won't fuck around no more - I AM THE LAW!

I judge the rich, I judge the poor - I AM THE LAW!
Commit a crime I'll lock the door - I AM THE LAW!
Because in Mega-City I AM THE LAW!
CRIME - The ultimate sin
Your iso-cube is waiting when he brings you in
LAW - It's what he stands for
Crime's his only enemy and he's going to war
CRIME - The ultimate sin
Your ISO-cube is waiting when he brings you in
LAW - It's what he stands for
Crime's his only enemy and he's going to war
Respect the badge - he earned it with his blood
Fear the gun - your sentence may be death because...
I AM THE LAW!
And you won't fuck around no more - I AM THE LAW!
I judge the rich, I judge the poor - I AM THE LAW!
Commit a crime I'll lock the door - I AM THE LAW!
Because in Mega-City - I AM THE LAW!
And you won't fuck around no more - I AM THE LAW!
I judge the rich, I judge the poor - I AM THE LAW!
Commit a crime I'll lock the door - I AM THE LAW!
Because in Mega-City...
I...
AM...
THE...
LAW!
