If this is a siege
I'll wait this out
I'll wait this out
I'll wait this out

If this is a siege
I'll wait this out
I'll wait this out
But I'm full of doubt

I awoke with a face like a crumpled plastic bag in a puddle
When everyone in this town is a bag for life
He said my life is a total mess, it's 8pm and I'm not even dressed
And oh how I miss your Prosecco-glazed lips
I miss like the majority of modern mainstream music misses
An original metaphor for missing someone

I was so scared of confronting the world alone
Fear put me in a headlock and dragged me back from the unknown

So if this is a siege
I'll wait this out
I'll wait this out
But I'm full of doubt

If this is a siege
I'll wait this out
I'll wait this out
But I'm full of doubt

I tried to defend our castle walls
But the attack came from within the halls
You say that time heals so
I'll wait this out
I'll wait this out
But I'm full of doubt

I'll wait this out
I'll wait this out
I'll wait this out
I'll wait this out
I'll wait this out
I'll wait this out

I may backtrack on these words one day
I may orphan what I'm about to say
But in my chest there's a thundering pain
It feels like God's in there, having a migraine

And this is tough, man
I've lost more pieces of my jigsaw
It don't seem worth making now, nan
They say you've gotta stay busy
I'll keep keep keep my mind occupied on the here and now
'Cause you're not with me
But that's okay, we'll cope somehow
We all cope somehow
We'll cope somehow

We'll cope somehow
We all cope somehow
We'll cope somehow!
We all cope somehow!
