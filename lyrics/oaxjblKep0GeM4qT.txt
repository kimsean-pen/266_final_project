All I want is a room with a view
A sight worth seeing a vision of you
All I want is a room with a view

I will give you my finest hour
The one I spent watching you shower
I will give you my finest hour

All I want is a photo in my wallet
A small rememberance of something more solid
All I want is a picture of you

Picture this a day in December
Picture this feezing cold weather
You got clouds on your lids and you'd be on the skids if it
weren't for your job at the garage
if you could only,
Picture this a sky full of thunder
Picture this my telephone number
One and One is what I'm telling you

All I want is 20-20 vision
A total portrait with no omissions
All I want is a vision of you

If you can

Picture this - a day in December
Picture this - feezing cold weather
You got clouds on your lids and you'd be on the skids if it
weren't for your job at the garage
if you could only,
Picture this - a sky full of thunder
Picture this - my telephone number
One and One is what I'm telling you

get a pocket computer
try to do what ya used to do.
