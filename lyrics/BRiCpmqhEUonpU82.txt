Clap if you've got a ticket to the end of the world
Clap if you've got a ticket to the end of the world

It was his last day on the force
He was going through divorce
He was a living breathing action screenplay cliche
They said that they found it in the basement
Enough to just blow that roof to the pavement
And he was the man for the job
A one-man bomb squad
A middle aged mess thinking

I feel like I'm gonna explode
Any moment
I'm ready to blow
I can't stand it
I get so worried
I get so low
But if I'm never your hero
I can never let you down
And the sirens go
Oh ah oh ah

Clap if you've got a ticket to the end of the world

Their last hopes on him they'd hung
And they weighed him like a ton
But perhaps for him he'd none much left to lose
Tony, don't sweat it
Keep your hands steady
You were born on a dare but you were born ready
Cut the red wire
Or was that the green wire
You're on fire like

I feel like I'm gonna explode
Any moment
I'm ready to blow
I can't stand it
I get so worried
I get so low
But if I'm never your hero
I can never let you down
And the sirens go
Oh ah oh ah

Clap if you've got a ticket of the end of the world
Clap if you've got a ticket to the end of the world

And if this is it
I want to go out with a bang
But I don't claim to know anything

I feel like I'm gonna explode
Any moment
I'm ready to blow
I can't stand it
I get so worried
I get so low
But if I'm never your hero
I can never let you down
And the sirens go
Oh ah oh ah
And if this is it
I want to go out with a bang
