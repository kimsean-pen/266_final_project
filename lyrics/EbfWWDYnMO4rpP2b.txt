I climb the stairs to the edge of the water
You are alone at the time of departure we reside
Suspended in thought the mind becomes a rival
The beacon remains and we left behind

Remember the view you were there that day
I could not see it any other way
I miss you now more than ever before we guess
I miss you now more than ever before
Can we go back to the tide
Back to the life
Back to your tide
Back to your life
