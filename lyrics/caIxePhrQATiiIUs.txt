I saw her, yeah I saw her with her black tongue tied
Round the roses
Fist pounding on a vending machine
Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger

With a noose she can hang from the sun
And put it out with her dark sunglasses
Walking crooked down the beach
She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching

And I know I'm gonna steal her life
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs

And I know I'm gonna steal her life
Nothing that I wouldn't try

Hey, my cyanide girl
Hey, my cyanide girl
My cyanide girl
Hey, my cyanide girl

I saw her, yeah I saw her with her hands tied back
And her rags were burning
Calling out from a landfilled life
Scrawlin' her name upon the ceiling

Throw a coin in the fountain of dust
White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for my midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving

And I know I'm gonna steal her life
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs

And I know I'm gonna steal her life
Nothing that I wouldn't try

Hey, my cyanide girl
Hey, my cyanide girl
My cyanide girl
Hey, my cyanide girl
Guitar Solo
Hey, my cyanide girl
Hey, my cyanide girl
My cyanide girl
Hey, my cyanide girl
Hey, my cyanide girl
Hey, my cyanide girl
My cyanide girl
Hey, my cyanide girl
