Do you need it once a day
Twice a day, three times a day, four times a day
You gotta let me know

I need a little lovin' at least two times a day
So when I call ya boy, you better run here right away
Let's have a show of hands, who's addicted to their man

You wanna say I'm yours, I wanna say get it
You wanna say, so say, I know what you're thinking babe

And if the feeling's real

Could you break and shake my cold and stormy weather
Have you got this under control
Show me you know about a woman's soul

So tell me babe
