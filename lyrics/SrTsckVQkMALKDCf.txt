When I became of age, my mother called me to her side
She said, son, you're growing up now
Pretty soon you'll take a bride

And then she said, just because you've become a young man now
There's still some things that you don't understand now
Before you ask some girl for her hand now
Keep your freedom for as long as you can now
My mama told me, you better shop around (shop, shop)
Oh yeah, you better shop around (shop, shop around)

Ah, there's some things that I want you to know now
Just as sure as the winds gonna blow now
The women come and the women gonna go now
Before you tell 'em that you love 'em so now
My mama told me, you better shop around, (shop, shop)
Oh yeah, you better shop around (shop, shop around)

A-try to get yourself a bargain son
Don't be sold on the very first one
A-pretty girls come a dime a dozen
A-try to find one who's gonna give you true lovin'

Before you take a girl and say I do, now
Make sure she's in love with-a you now
My mama told me, you better shop around
Ooh yeah, a-try to get yourself a bargain son
Don't be sold on the very first one
A-pretty girls come a dime a dozen
A-try to find one who's gonna give you true lovin'

Before you take a girl and say I do, now
Make sure she's in love with-a you now
Make sure that her love is true now
I hate to see you feelin' sad and blue now

My mama told me, you better shop around (shop, shop)
Don't let the first one get you
Oh no 'cause I don't want to see her with you
Uh huh, before you let her hold you tight
Ah, yeah, make sure she's alright
Before you let her take your hand, my son
Understand my son, be a man my son
I know you can my son, I love you (ah shop around)
