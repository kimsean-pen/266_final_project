Dark shadows from above
Ravens fly, obliterate the sun
"It's a sign of the devil
He will come for
His servant tonight"
These are dark times
Suspicious minds breed like rats
Guardians of corrupt morality
Spread their filthy lies

Am I to burn?
I have not sinned!
Burnt at the stake
Innocent blood that can
Never be washed clean

The flames of ignorance
Grow higher and higher
Licking my flesh
Burning my soul
The raven laughing
In the moon

These are dark times
Suspicious minds breed like rats
Guardians of corrupt morality
Spread their filthy lies again

Am I to burn?
I have not sinned!
Burnt at the stake
Innocent blood that can
Never be washed clean

-Solo-

Am I to burn?
I have not sinned!
Burnt at the stake
Innocent blood that can
Never be washed clean

-Solo-
