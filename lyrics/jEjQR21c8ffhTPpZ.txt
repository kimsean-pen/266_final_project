Why did you let him a getaway,
after the scaring what you say
Straight to the bone on that cold as ice, screaming my fist and pull the dime
She's in disguise and now she's in,
now it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him a getaway,
why did you let him a geta

Too bad, forget it,
'cause there's Al Capone in it
So sad, regret it,
'cause the mad man's out tonight

Should have told her,
nobody ever showed her 'bout this
And now I'm screaming,
nobody should be creeping this way
Should have told her,
nobody ever showed her 'bout this
And now I'm screaming,
nobody should be creeping this way
