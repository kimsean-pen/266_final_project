Hush now don't you cry
Everything will be just fine

You won't realize it's over
Til you slip into unconsciousness
And the moment takes over
Swallow your pride my soldiers
And embrace your abilities
Let your new mind take over

I take a bow
Listen to the crowd
My survival is all I think about now
It's for the best
We'll cure the helpless
Our survival is all we'll think about now

Hush now don't you cry
Everything will be just fine

His self-repairing skeleton
Cyborg man's computer blood
Programming immunity
Alpha being
His knowledge expands exponentially
As he rapidly evolves ad infinitum

Deleting disease, cut and sever
Cells and metal blend together
Replicating, assimilating, science and biology
The death of the robot, the birth of him
All at once we'll become him
The death of the robot, the birth of him
One by one we'll become him

Make this motherfucker golden
Make this motherfucker holy
Level up his brain in the fast lane
Make this being holy
Put him through the test inspections
Make this motherfucker holy

Make this motherfucker golden
Make this motherfucker holy

In future utopias, alpha hybrids evolve
Into progressive societies, worship efficiency
Technology makes me pray to logic
And science makes us strong
We rape the ignorance of man
Prepare the arrival

Right on time
He arrives
Alleviate the symptoms from
A toxic society
We praise the future

You won't realize it's over
Til you slip into unconsciousness
And the moment takes over
Swallow your pride my soldiers
And embrace your abilities
Let your new mind take over

I take a bow
Listen to the crowd
My survival is all I think about now
It's for the best
We'll cure the helpless
Our survival is all we'll think about now

Hush now don't you cry
Everything will be just fine
Hush now don't you cry
Everything will be just fine
Hush now don't you cry
Everything

Hush now don't you cry
Everything will be just fine

Put him through the test inspections
Make this motherfucker holy
Make this motherfucker golden
Make this motherfucker holy
