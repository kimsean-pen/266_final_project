I know I'm still young (yeah)
With no life experience
But I gotta learn from my mistakes - not yours
Let me fly do my own thing have a little peace
Wrap me up in cotton wool
And I'll never learn

Chorus
Look at me
I'm still your little girl
Look at me
The centre of your world (your world, your world)

You know you are my friend
But you got to understand
That if you stop me you'll only end up alone
Let me use what you gave me
Always listening to me
And put to use what I have learnt
So I can return

Chorus
Look at me
(Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me)
I'm still your little girl
(Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me)
Look at me
(Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me)
The centre of your world
I'm still your little girl
(I'm still your little girl)

You know just what it meant to me
The way you have protected me
But now it's time for me to leave
To find my own destiny hey
I'll always belong with you
You taught me how to find my through
To keep my feelings straight and true
Most of what I am I owe it all to you

Chorus
Look at me
(Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me)
I'm still your little girl
(I'm still your little girl)
Look at me
(Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me)
Look at me
(Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me)
The centre of your world
I'm still your little girl

Chorus
Look at me
(Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me)
I'm still your little girl
(I'm still your little girl) (Ooooh)
Look at me
(Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me)
The centre of your world
Look at me, oooh
I'm still your little girl

Chorus
Look at me
(Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me)
I'm still your little girl
(I'm still your little girl)
Look at me
(Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me)
The centre of your world
I'm still your little girl

Look at me
I'm still your little girl
(Little girl, little girl)
