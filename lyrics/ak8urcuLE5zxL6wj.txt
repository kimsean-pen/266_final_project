I can't wait
Wait for you to change your mind
It's late
I'm trying to walk the line

Well, it's way past midnight and there's people all around
Some on their way up, some on their way down
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight
And I don't know how much longer I can wait

I'm your man
I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew
You understand .
That my heart can't go on beating without you

Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm reeling from the blow
I wish I knew what it was that keeps me loving you so
I'm breathing hard standing at the gate
But I don't know how much longer I can wait

Skies are gray
I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow
Night or day
It doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go

If I ever saw you coming I don't know what I might do
I'd like to think I could control myself but it isn't true
That's how it is when things disintegrate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait

I'm doomed to love you
I've been rolling through stormy weather
I'm thinking of you
And all the places we could roam together

It's mighty funny
The end of time has just begun
Oh honey
After all these years you're still the one

While I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate
But I don't know how much longer I can wait
