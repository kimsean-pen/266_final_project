I can tell you're standing
In shades from the light
I've seen your face before
And the way that it shines
Are you too shy to confront me
I understand
Take one step further
So I can feel you with my hands

We have to do this right
Here tonight
I feel this inner passion
I know you can be mine

Let's make this worth a try
Here tonight
I've waited all my life for you
I want this to be nice

As I see you
Come into the light
It's making me warmer
And stronger inside
As long as you're near me
Stand by my side
I can do everything
And show my better sides
(show my better sides)

We have to do this right
Here tonight
I feel this inner passion
I know you can be mine

Let's make this worth a try (Let's make this worth a try)
Here tonight
I've waited all my life for you
I want this to be nice

(I feel this inner passion)
(We have to do this right)
(I want this to be nice)
