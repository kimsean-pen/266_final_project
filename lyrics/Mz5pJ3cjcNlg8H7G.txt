Why is it always slow
The things ya doin
Ah-ah-ha-ah-ah it's just my jealous mind
And when you're not at home
I just can't take it
Ah-ah-ha-ah-ah it's just my jealous mind

I dreamt a time when you might leave me
Deep in my heart
I know you'll never go
Or say you'll leave me

You could be out with him
And I would never mind
Ah-ah-ha-ah-ah it's just my jealous mind

I dreamt a time when you might leave me
Deep in my heart
I know you'll never go
Or say you'll leave me

Stay with me all the time
Say there's no other guy
Ah-ah-ha-ah-ah it's just my jealous mind
I love you so
It's just my jealous mind
Forgive my jealous mind
It's just my jealous mind
Blame it on my jealous mind
I can't help my jealous mind
It's just my jealous mind
It's in love that I'm so blind
Blame it on my jealous mind
Say forgive my jealous mind
It's just my jealous mind
Blame it on my jealous mind
I can't help my jealous mind
