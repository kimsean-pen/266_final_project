Do this thing, this type of thing
Put a little money in this type of thing
I got nothing to worry about
I got nothing to worry about

Do this thing, this type of thing
Put a little money in this type of thing
I got nothing to worry about
I got nothing to worry about

Beggar tune, why always so negative?
If you have problems why don't you go solve them?
Beat me up, at least you won't be out of touch
If you're such a poet use your tongue and show it

Do this thing, this type of thing
Put a little money in this type of thing
I got nothing to worry about
I got nothing to worry about

Do this thing, this type of thing
Put a little money in this type of thing
I got nothing to worry about
I got nothing to worry about

Trouble seems, trouble seems to follow you
It's always 'round you like some thing you subscribe to
Be prepared there must be something in you
Turning boys to men and then back again

Do this thing, this type of thing
Put a little money in this type of thing
I got nothing to worry about
I got nothing to worry about

Do this thing, this type of thing
Put a little money in this type of thing
I got nothing to worry about
I got nothing to worry about

Do this thing, this type of thing
Put a little money in this type of thing
I got nothing to worry about
I got nothing to worry about

Do this thing, this type of thing
Put a little money in this type of thing
I got nothing to worry about
I got nothing to worry about

Nothing to worry about
I got nothing to worry about
Nothing to worry about
I got nothing to worry about
