Fear Nothing, Say Nothing,
Pledge Allegiance to what's right,
The Future in Question,
Revolution Overnight,
For All the Disservice,
Into Peril We Fell,
My Instinct ticking like a Time Bomb,
The Human Race Implodes.

Some Choose to Celebrate,
Some Choose to Hate,
Some Choose to Live their Lifes through someone else's Pain,
All Those who Follow, All those with Faith,
Show Us Your Colours American Hate!

True American Hate (Hate)
True American Hate (Hate)
True American Hate (Hate)

Stand Up and Be Counted,
Stand Up for What's Right,
Fall to Resurgence,
Intuition Overnight,
The Final Plot in Question,
Evil Mind Overturned,
So Many Flags of Hate,
So Many Nations Scorned.

Some Choose to Celebrate,
Some Choose to Hate,
Some Choose to Live their Lifes through someone else's Pain,
All Those who Follow, All those with Faith,
Show Us Your Colours American Hate!

True American Hate (Hate)
True American Hate (Hate)
True American Hate (Hate)

Stand Tall and Be Proud,
Is There an End in Sight,
Ever Since Conception,
Always Fighting for your Life,
Underneath The Surface,
There Toils your Hell,
I'm Ticking Like a Time Bomb,
Watch the World Explode.

Some Choose to Celebrate,
Some Choose to Hate,
Some Choose to Live their Lifes through someone else's Pain,
All Those who Follow, All those with Faith,
Show Us Your Colours American Hate!

True American Hate (Hate)
True American Hate (Hate)
