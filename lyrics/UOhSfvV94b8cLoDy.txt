We don't have time left to regret
Hold on
It will take more than common sense
Hold on
So stop your wondering take a stand
Hold on
There's more to life that just to live

'Cause an empty room can be so loud
There's to many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

One single smile a helping hand
Hold on
It's not that hard to be a friend
Hold on
So don't give up, stand 'till the end
Hold on
There's more to life than just to live

'Cause an empty room can be so loud
There's to many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

When you love someone and they break you heart
Don't give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

When it falls apart and you're feeling lost
All your hope is gone, don't forget to
Hold on, hold on

'Cause an empty room can be so loud
There's to many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

When you love someone and they break you heart
Don't give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

'Cause an empty room can be so loud
There's to many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

When you love someone and they break you heart
Don't give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
