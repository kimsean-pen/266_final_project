Night after night, I close my eyes and I wonder when the sun will rise
Day by day, I live my life, I try my best to do what's right

A moment of hope is all I need to keep me moving on
Through the dark, till I see what's left to be revealed to me

If I dream everything I wanna be, if I dream all the possibilities
If you just believe in your wildest dreams they will come true,
they will come true

If I dream everything I wanna be, if I dream all the possibilities
If you just believe in your wildest dreams they will come true,
they will come true

I set my sights on a shooting star, traveling and yet so far
It's just a dream in my heart, it'll always be the biggest part

A moment of hope is all I need to keep me moving on
Through the dark, till I see what's left to be revealed to me

If I dream everything I wanna be, if I dream all the possibilities
If you just believe in your wildest dreams they will come true,
they will come true

If I dream everything I wanna be, if I dream all the possibilities
If you just believe in your wildest dreams they will come true,
they will come true

When you go to sleep tonight, dream a little baby, dream
The stars are in your eyes, dream a little baby, dream

When you go to sleep tonight, dream a little baby, dream
All the stars are in your eyes, dream a little baby, dream

If I dream everything I wanna be, if I dream all the possibilities
If you just believe in your wildest dreams they will come true,
they will come true

If I dream everything I wanna be, if I dream all the possibilities
If you just believe in your wildest dreams they will come true,
they will come true

If I dream everything I wanna be, if I dream all the possibilities
If you just believe in your wildest dreams they will come true,
they will come true
