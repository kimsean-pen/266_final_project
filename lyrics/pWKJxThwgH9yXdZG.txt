(It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic.
a kind of magic.)

One dream,
one soul, one prize,
one goal,
one golden glance
of what should be.
it's a kind of magic.

One shaft of light
that shows the way,
no mortal man
can win this day,
it's a kind of magic,

The bell that rings inside your mind,
it's a challenging
the doors of time,
it's a kind of magic,

The waiting seems eternity,
the day will dawn of sanity,
is this a kind of magic,
there can be only one,
this rage that lasts a thousand years
will soon be gone.

This flame
that burns
inside of me,
I'm hearing secret harmonies
(It's a kind of magic),
The bell that rings inside your mind,
is challenging
the doors of time.

(It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic)

This rage
that lasts
a thousand years,
will soon be will soon be,
will soon be gone,
This is a kind of magic,
there can only be one,
this life
that lasts a thousand years,
will soon be gone,
(Magic
it's a kind of magic,
it's a kind of magic,
magic, magic,
magic, magic,
it's magic,
it's a kind of magic)
