It's a question that I never learned to ask
How far I'd follow you into the dark
Yeah it's still a question that I'm too afraid to ask
How far I'd follow you, how far I'd follow you

When she saw that I'd tattooed my hands
I said mum I don't think I was ever gonna work for the bank
And I said that I was sorry about that line
I only wrote it cause it rhymed

We're not those kids sitting on the swing set
And I will follow you across the planet
If we could take our time
We'd get it right, we'd get it right

He was so bitter when he said
They'll offer you the world but they'll leave you for dead
And nobody tried to understand or at least act surprised
When I said that I wasn't the one who was unfaithful
That I could see why people thought I was
Sometimes making love is the only time I ever feel loved
There was never any middle ground

Now he sits alone in his one bedroom apartment
Tells himself he's happy and he made the right decisions
And he expected that I was gonna fail and run back
Well fuck that

But I'll wait for you
At the end of the earth is where I'll wait for you
You can meet me there
See I never really strayed far from here

Cause my head just gets so loud
I can't hear the words coming out of your mouth
Sorry I don't react the way you want me to sometimes
I only wrote it cause it rhymed

Your silhouette against the fire
Well I thought I saw a UFO
But it was just a lighter
And we nearly died
Shit I'm still amazed how we survived
Probably shouldn't let me drive
