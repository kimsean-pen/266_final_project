Day-light deals of bed-head
Gloria
Baby uh-uh it dont work
Oh Baby uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh

uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh uh, so slooowly
so slowly, into hearts of those who
need more than they get
Day-light deals of bed-head

to penguins that has laid too many bets

the mirror stares
you in the face

and says:
"baby uh uh, it don't work"

you say your prayers
though you dont care

you sing and you
shake the heaaaaaaart
Dance

Boogie Wonderland
Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts
of men who need more than they get
daylight deals a bad hand

to a women who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face and says
"baby, uh uh it don't work"
you say your prayers though you don't care
you dance and shake the hurt
Dance,
"MUMBLE!"
Boogie Bonderland
Dance, Dance
"MUMBLE!"
Boogie Wonderland
Yo soy Raúl, pingüino mas cool
Latino por supuesto, 100% español
My brothers (QUE?)
Loco me llaman
Una señorita me sirve como flama
La fiesta! Baila baila muchachita
Mi corazon, tiene dinamita (BOOM)
Exacto, te como en un taco
Dejame ser! tu papi pingüino!
baby penguin: "mumble!"
All the love in the world can't be gone
all the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing
and my heart keeps saying
"Boogie Wonderland, wonderland"
Dance
Boogie Wonderland
Dance
Boogie Wonderland
