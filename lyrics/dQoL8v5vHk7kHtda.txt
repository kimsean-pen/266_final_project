I made a brand of my own poison that I gave to you
It was the first of my experiments I'm going to put you through
Now it'll only make you dizzy, sick, and paralyzed
I think you'll live without the antidote, the ending's a surprise
I think you'll lie

One fell out of my dreams
It crept into my heart
Found the one and made its home there
I can't help what I've become
And when it's over stay true and act the part
I know it won't last but that's the way it goes

Now I can live with all my demons, we all get along
And they whisper in my ear "we're safe, there's always something wrong"
And if it looks like Armageddon's coming down today
I'll kick back a bottle of that poison, it's made for you and me
Come on, let's go

One fell out of my dreams
It crept into your heart
Paved the way for me to follow
But I was only 17
And when it's over, stay true and act the part
I know it won't last but that's the way it goes

Then I could feel it on, it's burning through my veins
I saw light today, I could manipulate
I made an ocean for you to sail
I promise you calm seas
Small waves through everything
I'll make it easy, then I'll float away
And if you find me courage to follow me
I hope you will

One fell out of my dreams
It crept into my heart
Found the one and made its home there
I can't help what I've become
And when it's over stay true and act the part
I know it won't last but that's the way it goes
