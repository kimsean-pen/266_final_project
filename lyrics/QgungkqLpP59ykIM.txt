Over their heads, I found a place to crawl away
So many times, I heard the things we used to say

Into the night, the conversation faded away
Losing the trail of all the things I had to say

It's not me, no, no, not me,
But I don't know what is
I try and find my peace of mind
But I know what I miss
Now it's gone
Now it's gone
Now it's gone

As everyone listened, my head turned away
I know what I'm missing, I've nothing to say

It's not me, no, no, not me,
But I don't know what is
I try and find my peace of mind
But I know what I miss

No, it's not me, no, no, not me,
But I don't know what is
I try and find my peace of mind
But I know what I miss
