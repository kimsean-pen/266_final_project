So far away and so alone
how could I ever take you home
You're beautiful, beautiful

You've got a devastating point of view
and everything you say is true
You're beautiful, beautiful

The nightbirds start to sing their favorite song:
"The Way You Say Good-Night"
The nightbirds start to sing their favorite song
and the moon begins to sing

I kiss you and the sun goes down
How come it's always dark when you're around
You're beautiful, beautiful
The nightbirds start to sing their favorite song
The moon begins to sing
You're beautiful, beautiful

The stars begin their Busby Berkeley dance:
"The Way You Say Good-Night"

And the night becomes a musical extravaganza:
"The Way You Say Good-Night"

The way you say good-night
I dream of all day long
Oh, I could write a song about the way you say good-night...
