And I'm here just, just like I used to be
We were here in old days with you, with me
All my fears have gone when you whisper to me
No matter how near or far apart, apart

When you feel so lonely, I'll be here to shelter you
When you feel so lonely, I'll be here, here for you
If I could fly above the clouds like all the birds
And I could hold you for a while to let you feel my pulse
Still here, all alone

My whole life and all my heart
You're my whole life and all my heart

And I'm here
Home, home
With you
With me
