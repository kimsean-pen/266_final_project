I say I wanna be healthy, but I turn up the noise
The IV drips a steady stream of poison
I think I'm just in love with the feeling
Break my bones so I can feel them healing

"Crazy" is, I believe, the medical term
When we wanna recover, but we don't wanna learn
Keep breaking what's been fixed a thousand times
And gimme some more of that iodine

I can't make reality connect
I push 'till I have nothing left
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singing these lullabies?

I'll run in circles 'till I crash
One day these steps will be my last
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singing these lullabies?

I say I wanna be happy, but I quickly forget
Will I sabotage all the good I've got left?
Depression's like a big fur coat
It's made of dead things but it keeps me warm

"Crazy" is, I believe, the medical term
When we wanna recover, but we don't wanna learn
Keep breaking what's been fixed a thousand times
And gimme some more of that iodine

I can't make reality connect
I push 'till I have nothing left
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singing these lullabies?

I'll run in circles 'till I crash
One day these steps will be my last
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singing these lullabies?

I don't like pain, but I bring it to life
I don't like scars, but I'm good with the knife
I don't like tears when I'm starting to cry
And then I realize I'm destroying my life

I do this to myself
I do this to myself
Stop blaming someone else
We do this to ourselves

I can't make reality connect
I push 'till I have nothing left
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singing these lullabies?
I'll run in circles 'till I crash
One day these steps will be my last
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singing these lullabies?
So if we want to wake up
Why we still singing these (why we still singing these lullabies?)
