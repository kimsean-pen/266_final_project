Caught in time so far away from where our hearts really wanted to be -
Reaching out to find a way to get back to where we'd been -
And if summer left you dry with nothing left to try -
This Time... Caught at a distance from myself
and there was no one there to know
What could I do?
I have learned sometimes a need can run too deep
and we throw away the things we most wanted to keep
and inside we lie over and over again
- This Time...
If you don't now you'd better learn to believe me when I say
I'm going to build a wall around this town Around these hearts and hands.
