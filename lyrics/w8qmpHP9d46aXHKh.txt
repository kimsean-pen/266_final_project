When the warmth of sun has faded
How will your arms fold?
What will your arms hold?
When the stars above have fallen
Where will your eyes be?
How will your eyes see?
Stone by stone
We've built these walls between us
We're combing the skylines with all of our wrongs
With all of our wrongs
Under the moon, a grieving winter
Frozen in our dreams
Moments that could be
Candles can't be held forever
The brightest of all dreams
Will fade into dark streams
Stone by stone
We've built these walls between us
We're combing the skylines with all of our wrongs
With all of our wrongs
Thorn by thorn
With guilt we've crowned our heroes
We're combing the skylines with all of our wrongs
With all of our wrongs
With the warmth of the sun there is something left to love
Left to love with the warmth of the sun
Stone by stone
We've built these walls between us
Combing the skylines with all of our wrongs
With all of our wrongs
