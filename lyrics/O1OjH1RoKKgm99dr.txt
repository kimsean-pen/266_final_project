Lately I've been walking
Through these places that I cannot stand
I guess it's just my history talking
Now I'm refusing to supply your demands

You say
The storm will pass
We'll work it out
The roads can get a little rough sometimes
But I'm moving fast
Without a doubt
Our hearts will beat in separate rooms tonight

Baby, we belong alone
This last second chance is blown
Baby, we all belong alone
I've got another you at home
Baby, we belong alone

And lately you've been knocking
But I never really listened or cared
'Cause when I told you I was walking
I was reeling her in with my stare

You say
The storm will pass
We'll work it out
The roads can get a little rough sometimes
But I'm moving fast
Without a doubt
Our hearts will beat in separate rooms tonight

Baby, we belong alone
This last second chance is blown
Baby, we all belong alone
I've got another you at home
Baby, we belong alone
