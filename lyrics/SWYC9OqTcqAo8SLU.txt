All that Louie, Gucci, Fendi, Prada I don't wear
Tryna do it like me but we don't compare I'm just too rare
I just do my thang that fuck shit yall can keep it over there
You-you-you say you don't like me I'm like cool, I don't care, woah
You say you don't like me I'm like cool, I don't care, yeah
You say you don't like me I'm like cool, I don't care, woah
You say you don't like me I'm like cool, I don't care, woah
You say you don't like me... woahhhh, I don't care

You say you don't like me, but I'ma just sip my tea
I ain't gon say shit back, I know you wanna cop my steez
I know you wanna be like me, be like this, bright pink hat to match the outfit
Same old me, but on some new shit
Really don't give a damn they mad cause I'm lit, like bic I feel like swae lee
Jacket on me from 1980
And I got a few more up in my closet, so you know my fit always be on fleek
Bitch I'm goin dumb, I'm just having fun

I-I-I just do my thang, I stay in my lane
You be switchin up
B-B-Bitch get out my way
Glasses on my face pink and green, oh so clean, just like Listerine
Hit the scene, they know it's me
Might just pull up in the limousine, tryna tell me how to live my life well we gon disagree
Bitch just let me breath
