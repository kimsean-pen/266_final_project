She made me admit I'm broken, I'm broken
shouldn't it after all that i preached I still can not accept
that i'm not a fit and once that of course the snowball,
snowballing down my spine
draws a perfectly imperfect line

Is it just the weight cuz the weight is what weighs me down again
or is it the scape goes over the clumsy friend
there to take all the blame for what's really happening
this circle must come to an end

And I've always liked that about me that I know what i am fighting for
and for this I'd go to war weapon in mind is my main skin
swallowed on the only body part
that should matter my heart

The only way is to let go get rid of all the fears
of not being perfect my goal seems perfectly clear
and terrified if I let go I also lose myself
and I don't wanna be somebody else

And I've always liked that about me that I know what i am fighting for
and for this I'd go to war weapon in mind is my main skin
swallowed on the only body part
that should matter my heart

And what if I've always been good enough in my skin,
good enough in my skin?
and what if I've always been good enough in my skin,
good enough in my skin?

And I've always liked that about me that I know what i am fighting for
and for this I'd go to war weapon in mind is my main skin
swallowed on the only body part
that should matter my heart
