The only rule to stay alive
Just keep breathing you'll be fine
You know she's pulling up outside
The car lights crawl across the curtain
So put the gun back on the wall
Take the suitcase from the wardrobe
There's a dead man on the floor
He's not going anywhere
You're moving to the door
And everything he ever did
He only ever did for love
Everything he ever said
He only ever said for love
And now, now he lies dead,
He's dead for love
His mind's at ease, he sleeps in peace
Your reflection in her eyes
You just don't recognise
And soon you'll realise
This guy's not going anywhere
Now he's done with you once more
Race with the shadows to the door
A guy like this needs to be sure
No one was there was there when the devil rode out before
And everything he ever did
He only ever did for love
Everything he ever said
He only ever said for love
And now, now he lies dead,
Oh he's dead for love
His mind's at ease, he sleeps in peace
In English shadows you will walk tall
And there you'll stay until you fall
And when the final hour arrives
It's only lovers left alive
Wretched souls and gangsters' molls
Beyond the valley of the dolls
The story they will never tell
Because their lips are sealed
And everything you ever did
You only ever did for love
And everything you ever said
You only ever said for love
And now, now he lies dead,
Oh he's dead for love
Your mind's at ease, you sleep in peace
And everything you ever did
You only ever did for love
And everything you ever said
You only ever said for love
And now, now he lies dead,
Oh he's dead for love
Your mind's at ease, you sleep in peace
