Welcome to eternity
Welcome infinity
Goodbye to sobriety
Goodbye to you and me
As for why in the water
I can return me at the tone

I say goodbye to all I know
As if not they can help me
As if not they could hurt
As if not they can help me
As if not they could hurt

Welcome to liberty
Welcome the piece of me
Welcome to loneliness
Welcome to random sex
An baby your welcome
But I don't know where to go

I said goodbye to all I know
As if not they can help me
As if not they could hurt
As if not they can help me
As if not they could hurt
