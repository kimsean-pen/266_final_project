Maybe the sun will shine today
The clouds will blow away
Maybe I won't feel so afraid
I will try to understand
Either way
Maybe you still love me, maybe you don't
Either you will or you won't
Maybe you just need some time alone
I will try to understand
Everything has it's plan
Either way
I'm gonna stay right for you
Maybe the sun will shine today
The clouds will roll away
Maybe I won't be so afraid
I will understand
How everything has it's plan
Either way
