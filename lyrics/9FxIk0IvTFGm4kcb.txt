Woke from my sleep last night
All sweating with quite a fright
Looked to see if your next to me
Somehow I knew you wouldn't be

Seems that my dreams only come true
When my dreams aren't about you
Nightmares are all you bring to me

I'll keep searching for you
I'll keep searching for you
I'll keep searching for you
I'll keep searching for you

I'll keep searching for you
I'll keep searching for you
I'll keep searching for you
I'll keep searching for you

Lonely days and sleepless nights
This doesn't seem so right
It leaves me wanting more
More than I did before

Seems that my dreams only come true
When my dreams aren't about you
Nightmares are all you bring to me

I'll keep searching for you
I'll keep searching for you
I'll keep searching for you
I'll keep searching for you

I'll keep searching for you
I'll keep searching for you
I'll keep searching for you
I'll keep searching for you

I'll keep searching for you
I'll keep searching for you
I'll keep searching for you
I'll keep searching for you

I keep searching for you
I keep searching for you
I keep searching for you
I keep searching for you
