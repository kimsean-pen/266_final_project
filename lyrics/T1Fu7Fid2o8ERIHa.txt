Spend the night on my own just like I always do
It's not that weird, I'm too young
Time is forever no

Until it's not
And every run around me feels the opposite of luck
They think you're roomy instead of giving love
Dont think this is how you take feelings away
Give a chance, do at least feel it away

'Cause now I'm at a point where I don't care if you mess me up
I've been there on my own against myself enough
Maybe if it's in the verse then I could stop the trip
But I'm at a point where I don't care if you mess me up, mess me up
Mess me up

Wanna do things that I am not supposed to do
Be a good girl, that is all you really have to do

Until it's not
And every run around me feels the opposite of luck
They think you're roomy instead of giving love
Dont think this is how you take feelings away
Give a chance, do at least feel it away

'Cause now I'm at a point where I don't care if you mess me up
I've been there on my own against myself enough
Maybe if it's in the verse then I could stop the trip
But I'm at a point where I don't care if you mess me up, mess me up

I'm already at a point where there's no return
And I don't care what you do, you can make me burn
I find a way to come back, yeah my body learns
So I don't care what you do, come and make me burn
(Ah, mess me up)
