I must've stumble out of the plane
cause i free-fell all year
my shoot is illuminous like spring
and i'm nowhere now, but here

When i've seen your long hair come down
it turned my head inside out
and i want you, i want you
i still do

Your wrists were bound in my hands
while i wash around my naked feet
your blue jeans over in the sand
we were wrestling up in the blanket sheets

But I've seen your long hair come down
(seen your long hair come down)
turned my head inside out
(turned my head inside out)

And i want you, i want you
i still do
i still, i still do
I've seen your long hair come down
and turned my head inside out
but i've seen your long hair come down
turned my head inside out
