Hit up the bottle
Hearts will melt like ice
As lights keep falling
Makes you feel so small again

As we walk in circles
A blind leading the blind
No way of hiding
A heart is all we've got

I'm hungry for you my love
So come out and rescue me
Love is just not enough
Out in this war of needs

Drag your heart up
To the place where it belongs
While it's under water
Where my love will fill your lungs

Clouds are shaking
And your palms began to crack
Hands against your eyes
See this love is all we've got

I'm hungry for you my love
So come out and rescue me
Love is just not enough
Out in this war of needs

It's a hive of honeybees
Trapped inside of our skin
Growing faster
Stinging harder
Till we all give in

I'm hungry for you my love
So come out and rescue me
Love is just not enough
Out in this war of needs

I'm hungry for you my love
So come out and rescue me
Love is just not enough
Out in this war of needs

I'm hungry for you my love
Love is just not enough

It's a hive of honeybees
Trapped inside of our skin
Growing faster
Stinging harder
Till we all give in
