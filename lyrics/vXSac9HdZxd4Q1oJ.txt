There's no sense in me staying
Then why does it matter?
I hope someday soon maybe we'll finish this chapter

And now at this moment I don't know what else to think
There's no sense in me saying: "I guess I still miss you"

So now I need names and faces
Examine the suspects
Get the D.A. here now

You'll tell everyone that it's so much fun
Say to all my friend it never ends
While we're driving through the alley ways
We picked up some happiness on the way

I'll tell everyone that it's so much fun
Say to all your friends it never ends
While we're driving through all the alley ways
I picked up some happiness

Just because you move your hips
Doesn't mean that you exist
Just because you move your lips
Doesn't mean that you
Can we just take a fucking break
'Cause I feel like I have got nothing left
Nothing left

I guess I still miss you
Oh well, it's me and you
What else can we do?
When talking's for functioning people
I guess I still miss you
But talking's for functioning people
I guess I still miss you

You'd always say we'd win the lottery someday
So I wouldn't have to go away
I should have known that I had it all along
But I didn't know till you were gone

Let's see you function now
Touch your nose, jump around
Footprints, in God we trust
Jes-You, Jes-Me, Jesus
Pick up ten sac orange crush
Two bottles, cups, and blunts
What do scorned lovers do?
Dancing with all my crew
Drink and drive life away
Gamble with everyday

Just because you move your hips
Doesn't mean that you exist
Just because you move your lips
Doesn't mean shit
Can we just take a fucking break
'Cause I feel like I have got nothing left
Nothing left

I guess I still miss you
Oh well, it's me and you
What else can we do?
When talking's for functioning people

I guess I still miss you
But talking's for functioning people
I guess I still miss you

You'd always say we'd win the lottery someday
So I wouldn't have to go away
I should have known that I had it all along
But I didn't know till you were gone

You'd always say we'd win the lottery someday
So I wouldn't have to go away
You'd always say we'd win the lottery someday
So I wouldn't have to go away
