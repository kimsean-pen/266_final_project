In the darkness she is dancing with her lover oh oh
In the silence of the mountain hall she'll rest forever oh oh

It's a life of a warrior who never comes out
It's a song without music she's one of a kind

She's a black ninja, ninja
You can't see her in the night

Close your eyes, feel the magic of the night, whoo-o-ooh
Lonely voices whispering her ancient name, whoo-o-ooh

It's a life of a warrior who never comes out
It's a song without music she's one of a kind

She's a black ninja, ninja
You can't see her in the night
She's a black ninja, ninja
You can't feel her in the dark

It's a life of a warrior who never comes out
It's a song without music she's one of a kind

She's a black ninja, ninja
You can't see her in the night
She's a black ninja, ninja
You can't feel her in the dark

She's a black ninja

Ninja, she's a black ninja

Ninja
