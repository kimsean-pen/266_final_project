The moment that you wake from your disguise
They record you with their eyes.
No matter how, long or hard they try
You know they won't shake it
You know they won't shake it.

Reaching for the seam that holds you in
To find where you begin.
Frozen in the pose they've chalked us in
You know we can't break it
You know we can't break this.

Slowly disappearing out of view
Holding on to you.

Slowly disappearing out of view
Holding on to you.

The shutter clicks and we're immortalised
Flashbulb our goodbyes.
No matter how, long or hard you try
You know you can't fake it
You know you can't fake this.

Slowly disappearing out of view
Holding on to you.

Slowly disappearing out of view
Holding on to you.

Slowly disappearing out of view
Holding on to you.

Slowly disappearing out of view
Holding on to you.
