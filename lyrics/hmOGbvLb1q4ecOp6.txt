The way you stand there in your three striped shell toes and
The way your hair dances, it's clear you want all eyes on you
It's all eyes on you
And though I know that I won't get no answers, I
I just can't stop from indulging my lean eyes on you
My fool eyes on you

As you dance on your burning clothes
I feel the bullet holes
Tell myself I've got nothing to lose
Though your touch gives me vertigo, I'm like a domino
Darling I keep falling back to you

But if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
You pull me closer
You say you miss the way I hold ya
I feel you breathing on my shoulder
Why do you stop me getting sober?

You leave your sweet bitter taste on my tongue and
You leave your smoke to seep deep into my lungs
I know how you're taking hold
My love is wasted and somehow you laced it
And I'm on my knees
There's no remedy

As you dance on your burning clothes
I feel the bullet holes
Tell myself I've got nothing to lose
Though your touch gives me vertigo, I'm like a domino
Darling I keep falling back to you

But if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
You pull me closer
You say you miss the way I hold ya
I feel you breathing on my shoulder
Why do you stop me getting sober?

Na na na, na na na
Na na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na na

But if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
You pull me closer
You say you miss the way I hold ya
So if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
You pull me closer
You say you miss the way I hold ya
I feel you breathing on my shoulder
(Na na na, na na na
Na na na na)
Why do you stop me getting sober?
(Na na na, na na na
Na na na na)
Why do you stop me getting sober?
