You're in luck
I want you
Now you turn away
Now you say that
You would lie
Most always
Just take me when you can
Now you want it again

Blackest night
The highway
Her nails so red and wild
Her blue green slip and the oceanside
Her hair down and dried
Surrender everything
I'll see you at the edge of night
I'll see you at the edge of life

And all the time
Not endless
The guys pack into the car
The girls they sit and you and I
Not endless
So for now we'll go inside
Turn the TV on and then we'll
I want you
Can I do that
I miss you
Can I do that
I need you
Can I do that
I miss you
Can I do
