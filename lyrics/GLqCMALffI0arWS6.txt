In the dark of the night I found
Without my love, my love,
these words are not a bit profound,
if it's just another cheap line flung.

Outside ecstatic love,
what did we think we'd find?
Over that broken road,
out past the land mines.

I'm gonna keep your heart
I'm gonna keep your heart.
With the world all falling apart,
I'm gonna keep your heart.

Can I coax it out its shell
Brush the dust off
Get its wings on
In this little bell
We will also feel the singing, oh

Shine on, light of love
On all these bruises and scars
Ruins in every less
But it can't cancel out the stars

Dropped all your clothes and life
Wonder Woman of mine
Kneeling above this playful body
Teach Superman to fly

How'm I gonna keep your heart?
How'm I gonna keep your heart?
If the world all falls apart
How'm I gonna keep your heart?

Time alone will tell
If you're the kind who keeps the veil on
Biding time will tell us
When and if to sail on

All these blues I have cried
In the end will come undone
Tried all the new designs
Still ended up in love

Still we're kind of shy
You've nothing to be ashamed of
Though its hard to tell
If I'll ever feel the same love

I'm gonna keep your heart
I'm gonna keep your heart
If the world all falls apart
Still, I'm gonna keep your heart
