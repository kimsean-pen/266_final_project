There's no need to hold back anymore
My heart is here for you to take
As the moonlight shines across the seashore, it's hard to ignore; it keeps me awake
I keep thinking of what we could have been, if we were just different people, where we'd begin.
Our love cannot go on, but I'm willing to fight until I'm gone

Baby, don't cry tonight
After the darkness passes by
Baby, don't cry tonight
You won't even remember why

I will never let you disappear into the sea
Won't you please listen to me?
So baby, don't cry, cry
I promise my love will protect you

Just erase all the doubt in your heart, and accept what fate has said
It seems like we'd never even meet from the start, but it's clear now we can't be apart
When you smile, the sun shines
You're so brilliant that there aren't words I can say
Waves crash into my heart; its pieces now washed away

Baby, don't cry tonight (whoo)
Now darkness plagues the once clear sky (ooh it's as if the sky will fall)
Baby, don't cry tonight
It seems to fit well with this night

There was once a fleeting moment with just you and I (you and I-I)
Now we have to say goodbye (yeah)
So baby, don't cry (don't cry), cry (cry)
My love will just become a memory

Yo, the cold air around me is suffocating, but I'm all caught up in the pain of parting
I'm not breathing (I am hurting)
Only your smile can help stop the bleeding, uh
I can't do anything but hope our story has an ending
Don't cry; I don't wanna' see tears falling down your face as I am leaving you, baby

Say no more (baby), no more (don't cry)
Please don't hesitate or it'll all fall apart; our love's already been collapsing
Say no more (baby), no more (don't cry)
I want you to live without me by your side
Quickly, just end this pain that's in my heart

I see the reflection of the moon in your eyes, ooh ooh whoa
Without a sound, I turn to the light that now sweeps through the sky

Baby, don't cry tonight (cry)
After the darkness passes by (I can hold you in my arms)
Baby, don't cry tonight (ooh yeah)
You won't even remember why (oh!)

I will never let you disappear into the sea
Won't you please listen to me? (whoa whoa whoa oh oh)
So baby, don't cry (don't cry), cry (cry)
I promise my love will protect you (cry)

As early sunlight pierces the night sky (night sky), it reminds me of you before our goodbye (falling down)
My eyes that have lost their way (oh oh) can only cry, cry, cry
