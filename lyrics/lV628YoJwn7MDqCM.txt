Oh come on baby let's take a ride
So many things is on my mind
Oh girl I really want you to know
How much I really really love you so

Ah, porque eu te amo, amor
I think I love you
I really love you, babe

Ah eu vou te contar
No sonho me apaixonei
Eu vou te encontrar
Amor acordei

Lord of mercy tell me what to do
This coolie girl she got lot of groove
Every night now I hope and pray
She gonna bring sweet love my way
She lick up my head and rip up my soul
Please girl don't let me loose control
Come on baby now and hold me tight
I wanna feel this love tonight

Ah, porque eu te amo, amor
I think I love you
I really love you, babe
Ah, eu sei que te amo, amor
I think I love you
I really love you, babe
