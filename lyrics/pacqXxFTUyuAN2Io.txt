It's hard to hear
You're in and out
I can tell you're running
Oh, it never ends
Better off or better on?
Body lover or wrecker?
There's a lot still to live for
There's a lot going on, let it out
Find a light in a cool color
Finding me, finding a love that oozes
I think I know the now

(I think I know)
(I think I, I think I know)
