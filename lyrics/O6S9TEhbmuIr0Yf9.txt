Shake down, you make me break, for goodness sake
I think I'm on the edge of something new with you
Shout out, don't drown the sound
I'll drown you out, you'll never scream so loud
As I want to scream with you

Standing there with your smile blinding your eyes from seeing
my face as I'm dying to figure out a girl
But she drifts so far away, I'm on her coast
So maybe I should stay and map around your world

So Don't Say, These currents are still killing me
And you can't explain
How the wind went and pulled me into your hurricane
Into your hurricane

Stand up don't make a sound, your ears might bleed
There's sweet fluorescent enemies that live inside of me
The world moves faster than I knew, not fast enough
To not creep up on you and the space we put between

So pull me under your weather patterns
Your cold fronts and the rain don't matter
Because a sun burns what I needed

So Don't Say, These currents are still killing me
And you can't explain
How the wind went and pulled you into the hurricane
Into the hurricane

You don't do it on purpose but you make me shake
Now I count the hours until you wake
With your babies breath
Breathe symphonies
Come on sweet catastrophe

Well maybe this time I can follow through
I can feel complete, stop paying dues
Stop the rain from falling
keep my ocean calm
This time I know nothings wrong

So Don't Say, These currents are still killing me
And you can't explain
How the wind went and pulled me in and no
You Don't Say, These currents are still killing me
And you can't explain
How the wind went and pulled me into your hurricane
Into your hurricane, into your hurricane
