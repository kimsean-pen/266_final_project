Damaged ones made to fit a frame
I already know we're not the same
And you say there's nothing to it there's no harm but you Don't want to do it
And you say there's nothing to it it's o.k. but you don't want to do it.
Salt of the earth on an open wound.
Salt of the earth on an open wound.
Cutting in won't seem right
Tear your skin and invite it in
ANd you say there's nothing to it there's no harm but you don't want to do it
And you say there's nothing to it it's o.k. but you don't want to do it.
Salt of the earth on an open wound.
Salt of the earth on an open wound.
Injury you can't explain
Injure me inflict no pain
And you say why'd i do it and you say you put me to it
Aon't you know you put me to it don't know you i said i'd do it.
Salt of the earth on an open wound.
