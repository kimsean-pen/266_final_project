Let's go!

As you cry in silver rings and pose
In a second you'll be high and in the clouds alone
I never thought I'd see the day
But I see stars around your face
Just like we're in the movies and you're scared
This was never my intention after all
So tell me, what the fuck did I do?

Damn, not even from my lifeless, cold, dead hands
We're made to destroy

Tell me what you want until it hurts
I'll hang myself in lights and I will glow for you
The colors, oh my god it says you
Spinning on this circus ride
You're further than you've ever been
Stuck in zero-gravity we laugh
I think we're in over our heads

I can't deny it's getting worse
Trust me it's a blessing and a curse
Call me if you're crashing, we'll take turns
Hello, welcome to Southern California
Now go back home

Stand back, I can't believe...
Do the math, the sky will fall anyway
Trust me this is a blessing and a curse
This much I can't deny
I can't deny it's getting worse
Trust me it's a blessing and a curse
