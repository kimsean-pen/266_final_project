I wasn't welcomed there
They all want me out
Do I really have the reason or
Should I just leave?
I said, "I won't come around here no more"
But, take a bit easy on me
'Cause my friends are weirder than me
You know how we are

We only
Want a little sympathy and hopes
Know how to be loved
We were only
Small amount of poison, but not in your blood
Taught by great, great love

We weren't welcomed there
They all want us out
Do we really have the reason or
Should we just go?

We won't stay around here no more
But, if you would need us to help you with our love
We are glad to be with you

We only
Want a little sympathy and hopes
Know how to be loved
We were only
Small amount of poison, but not in your blood
Taught by great, great love

Yes, we are
Sing along with me
