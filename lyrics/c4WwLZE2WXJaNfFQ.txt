Close your eyes
Give me your hand darling
Do you feel my heart beating?

Do you understand?
Do you feel the same
Or am I only dreaming?
Is this burnin', an eternal flame?
I believe
Its meant to be darlin'
I watch you when you are sleeping

You belong with me
Do you feel the same
Or am I only dreaming?
Is this burnin', an eternal flame?
Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
My whole life so lonely

And come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling
Call my name
Call my name
Call my name

Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
My whole life so lonely

And come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling
Close your eyes
Give me your hand darling
Do you feel my heart beating?

Do you understand?
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burnin', an eternal flame?
Close your eyes
Give me your hand darling
Do you feel my heart beating?

Do you understand?
Do you feel the same
Or am I only dreaming
Or is this burnin', an eternal flame?
Close your eyes
Give me your hand darling
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand?
Do you feel the same
Or am I only dreaming?
Or is this burnin', an eternal flame?
