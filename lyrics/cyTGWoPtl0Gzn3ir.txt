I was holding my breath in a tunnel that
seemed never ending, getting closer as I moved away
Chasing paper on a windy day
That's when I found you, by the walls of caramel
Then they fell

So I wait and I wait and I wait for you
And I hope that you are waiting too
Waiting, waiting, waiting, ooh
Feels like waiting is all I do
So I wait and I wait and I wait for you
And I hope that you are waiting too
Waiting, waiting, waiting, ooh
Feels like waiting is all I do

I wait and I wait and I wait and I

So I wait and I wait and I wait for you
And I hope that you are waiting too
Waiting, waiting, waiting, ooh
Feels like waiting is all I do
So I wait and I wait and I wait for you
And I hope that you are waiting too
Waiting, waiting, waiting, ooh
Feels like waiting is all I do

I'm still standing, waiting here, and I wait forever more
I'm still standing, waiting here, and I wait forever more
I'm still standing, waiting here, and I wait forever more
(Don't worry, don't worry, I'll be waiting here for you)
I'm still standing, waiting here, and I wait forever more
(Don't worry, don't worry, baby, what else would I do?)
I'm still standing, waiting here, and I wait forever more
(Don't worry, don't worry, I'll be waiting here for you)
I'm still standing, waiting here, and I wait forever more
(Don't worry, don't worry)
