You want it off so just take my spawn
Feel complete after it's gone
Don't sleep by my side, sleep on the lawn
It's not too late, you want to be gone

Itching inside, you still want more
Stillborn one crawling to the door

Through the hosiery
To the ovary

How does it feel when you can't feel nothing

Blood on my hands, you can wake up something

Through the hosiery
To the ovary

How does it feel when you can't feel nothing

Drink some more, feeling opened up
Your honor is the harm that you've done
Where's your throat, you can't have it back
Drink some more, I'll spit it right back

Fifteen years you've waited for me
Through preteen years of deficiency
Cover my head, but you can't see nothing
Blood on my hands, you can wake
