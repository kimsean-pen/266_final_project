Being him is who you are
Lay her in her lover's arms
He will never know why
He will never know why
And she will never know why
The sun in my eyes burns like her
Being him is who you are
Found you made us in a star

Eating us alive, all these young bodies turn
Evolve on a word
You found in my mind
It's all that I find
Here in a modern time
It's all been asked of you now

And if you wanna sell your body
There's a war to side
I don't wanna say what I want first
In the middle of your desert
Where I only made it worse would I
Light them up and know that it's done

There's a bottle full of water
I've been turning on its side
I don't mind if I don't find
Where it's been running all this time
I don't mind if I don't see it
I don't mind if don't feel it
I don't mind this game
I don't know what to say

If being him is who you are
Say it loud say you know you are
If all of this flies apart
He will never know what you are
And he will never know why
The sun in my eyes
Burns like her

Eating us alive, all these young bodies turn
Evolve on a word
You found in my mind

And if you wanna sell your body
There's a war to side
I don't wanna say what I want first
In the middle of your desert
Where I only made it worse would I
Light them up and know that it's done

There's a bottle full of water
I've been turning on its side
I don't mind if I don't find
Where it's been running all this time
I don't mind if I don't see it
I don't mind if I don't feel it
I don't mind this game
I don't know what to say
