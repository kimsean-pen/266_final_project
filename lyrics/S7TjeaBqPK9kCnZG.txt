Never forget, the way you took me by surprise
Never forget, the friend I couldn't recognize
Never forget, remember days of drugs and fun
Never forget, the person that you have become

His side, her side, blind side
All these images in my mind
His side, her side, blind side
All these images in my mind

Never forget, the way you used me, way you used me
Never forget, the person that you used to be
Never forget, always changing, always changing
Never forget, the way you're faking, always faking

His side, her side, blind side
All these images in my mind
His side, her side, blind side
All these images in my mind
All these images in my mind

Never forget, can't shake it off so easily
Never forget, the way you wanted it to be
Never forget, the way you made me feel inside
Never forget, when you took us for a ride

His side, her side, blind side
All these images in my mind
His side, her side, blind side
All these images in my mind
All these images in my mind
All these images in my mind
There's nowhere to hire
