Along the way I find myself
To be confined within me
No place for any others mind to interfere
To grasp the meaning of it all
To overcome my limits
And dance away from any void and empty tones

Just tell me why
Just tell me how I can survive this time

Believe yourselves and look away
From all that's right within you
Leave all your worries at the door
And drift away
I've tried to peer into the core
But could not storm the sorrow
My hollow heart has bled me dry, left me to stray

Another time
Without a trace
Condemned me now
Send me to hell
For I'm already failing

Intertwine the lines
That swim beneath the dark
Realize the pain we live in
Demonize the need we reel in
In my memories I'll dig deep enough to know
Centuries of dreams unending
Another me that yielded tears when someone had betrayed

No time to ever go to waste
It's not that complicated
You're free to live your life at ease
No more restraints
No heed for shadows on your way
That try to steal your laughter
Your light will drive them all away
Be confident

Will I refrain?
Can I repent?
Will you be there?
Erase the page
For I'm alone and ailing

Intertwine the lines
That swim beneath the dark
Realize the pain we live in
Demonize the need we reel in
In my memories I'll dig deep enough to know
Centuries of dreams unending
Another me that yielded tears when someone had betrayed

So
This is my life
And it can't break me down
Go
I will decide
Who can come in
And heal my disease
Burn it
In flames
Kill it
And maim
Why can't you see that you need to be freed

Intertwine the lines
Beneath the dark
Every bit of pain we're feeling
Every other solemn life
In the memories you will find somehow
There used to be a dream unending
No more need to be alone

Intertwine the lines
That swim beneath the dark
Realize the pain we live in
Demonize the need we reel in
In my memories I'll dig deep enough to know
Centuries of dreams unending
Another me that yielded tears when someone had betrayed
Someone had betrayed
