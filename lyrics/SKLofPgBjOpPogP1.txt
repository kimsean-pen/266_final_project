Losing sight of
Time
It's a week since I left
It's no time since I left

I'm losing faith in
Time
We're both grasping for words: please
Where are your words?

They're
Gone like all that came before, still
(How! You! Comfort! Me!)
I should've seen you more, I know
(How! You! Comfort! Me!)
Gone like all the chances
(How! You! Comfort! Me!)
I'm feeling low, I'm getting worn out
(How! You! Comfort! Me!)

Erased!
Erased!
Don't go!

I wanna know if we were like that
I wanna know if it's how we'll die
Thirty years and thirty questions
But now, you can't reply...
I hate what this has done

You see, this man before
Taught me how to be tender
I'm so glad it's still a part of you
I shouldn't ask for more
I shouldn't chase the past, but
There's so much I wanna show you, too
(There's no chance, now)

Gone like all that came before, still
(How! You! Comfort! Me!)
I should've seen you more, I know
(How! You! Comfort! Me!)
Gone like all the chances
(How! You! Comfort! Me!)
I'm feeling low, I'm getting worn out
(How! You! Comfort! Me!)

I wanna know if we were like that
I wanna know if it's how we'll die
Thirty years and thirty questions
But now you can't reply...
I hate what this has done

If the last thing we said
Could be the last thing we do
I know it comforts me
I hope it comforts you

You're long gone away
You've long lost the truth
If that's hard for me to say
It must be awful for you

Okay
Maybe I've not got it
Maybe you're lucid, or
Playing jokes in my behalf:
You've played bad jokes on me before

Maybe I've not got it
I feign indifference, so I
Hold you tight, just one last time;
I should've held you tight before

I wish I held you tight before

Oh, we live so far away
I want to comfort you
I hope it's the last thing I say
I hope it's the last thing I do

Oh, one day you'll forget
That I'll always love you
It's still the last thing I'll say
I know it's the last thing I do

So stay strong
Stay strong
Yeah, stay strong
