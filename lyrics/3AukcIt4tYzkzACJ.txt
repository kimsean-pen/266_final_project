I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense then you'll lose your mind
I'll use you as a focal point
So I don't lose sight of what I want
I've moved further than I thought I could
But I missed you more than I thought I would
I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense then you'll lose your mind
I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me
Talk some sense to me
I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me
Talk some sense to me
I'll use you as a makeshift gauge
Of how much to give and how much to take
I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense then you'll lose your mind
I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me
Talk some sense to me
I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me
Talk some sense to me
I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me
Talk some sense to me
I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me
Talk some sense to me
