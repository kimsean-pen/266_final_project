How about you, my new favorite thing
I hardly know, don't know you very well
I really hope that this summer you will change your pursuit
I don't mind, don't stand for you
How about you, my new favorite thing
The flashbulbs burn my irises
Still I love to see you up upon your pedestal
I just love to see you win
But when they torture you
It's like standing on a dragon's tongue, oh, oh
They flash your pretty nightmare on the sky
When, I was playing your card, ah
Kissing your deaf son away
How about you, my new favorite thing
With you and me you're hoping ever more
I know it's work to cope with my dementia and stuff
But I don't mind, don't stand for you
How about you, my new favorite thing today
I'm planting some flowers in your name
I'm trying to build a fake flag empire for free
'Cause I just love to see you win
When we experiment
I will put down your surrogate, oh, oh
I really can't conceive with any balance
In my future anyways, oh, oh
The comer is poisoned
You've rattled me this uncontrollable sensory
Your actions are an infinite defeat, oh
I've so much to tell you
And it can't wait 'til you're born again
