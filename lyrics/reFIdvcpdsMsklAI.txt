We kissed in a tunnel and our lips were shaking
If you're a bad boy then I must be Satan
And I don't say shit if it ain't no statement
I forgot your name but pass that, pass that elevation

Ooh, ooh, that's when the fire stops burning
Leaving smoke in the night
When you're feeling like all the memory like a ghost
Baby, that's when the fire stops burning
Leaving smoke in the night
Ooh, in the night

I used to have a man and you know we were so close
I can smell his breath in the depths of my pea coat
Got a backroom full of cranberry, just a young girl
Looking for a window like the tooth fairy
Ain't the right path if we're going down the right road

Ooh, ooh, that's when the fire stops burning
Leaving smoke in the night
When you're feeling like all the memory like a ghost
Baby, that's when the fire stops burning
Leaving smoke in the night, ooh
Ooh, in the night, ooh, in the night

I'm seeing smoke, seeing smoke
Don't you choke on me, baby, now
I'm seeing smoke, so much smoke
Don't be a ghost on me, baby, now
Don't be a ghost on me, baby, now
Don't be a ghost on me, baby, now
I'm seeing smoke, so much smoke
Don't be a ghost on me, baby, now

Ooh, ooh, that's when the fire stops burning
Leaving smoke in the night
When you're feeling like all the memory like a ghost
Baby, that's when the fire stops burning
Ooh, ooh, that's when the fire stops burning
Leaving smoke in the night
When you're feeling like all the memory like a ghost
Baby, that's when the fire stops burning
Leaving smoke in the night
