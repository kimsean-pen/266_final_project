Cheer up lady
I'm really into it
candor leaves us far behind
Let's see how twisted we can be

soak up pleasantries
of mildew and stitchery
the needlepoint has set designs
to show how easy it can be when we

waste it on
we waste it on
we waste it on

let's start making
maps out of all the dead skin
that maybe causing false alarms
it might be peeling much too quickly

clean up with me
the homemade surgeries
my veneers sink into you
and show how twisted we can be when we

waste it on
we waste it on
we waste it on

on sullen meadows that will fit right in
with lisping rivers that will fit right in
with mountain ranges through matted lenses
that will fit right in connect and dissect so we

with all your meadows they'll still see right in
with all your rivers they'll still see right in
no mountain ranges will stop them sensing
and they'll see right in and see right through cuz we

waste it on
we waste it on
we waste it on
we waste it on
