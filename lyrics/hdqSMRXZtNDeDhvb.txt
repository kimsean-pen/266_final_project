Black procession in the rain
Lovely brand new hearse
Everyone cries
Everyone cares
Or maybe just pretends

Oh, it's your big moment, by the way

Cold at heart
Indifference
Thought they were your best friends
Tears & flowers
From the one
You never would expect

Oh, it's your big moment, by the way
Would you like to tell them something?

Do you remember what you said
When I looked into your eyes
For the first time
I know you're not quite ready yet
But there's nothing to be afraid of
In your Summerland.

On the wall
In the waiting room
Still life in a frame
At the end of the corridor
Someone screams your name

Oh, it's your big moment by the way
Would you like to tell him something?

Do you remember what you said
When I looked into your eyes
For the first time

I know you're not quite ready yet
But there's nothing to be afraid of
In your Summerland
