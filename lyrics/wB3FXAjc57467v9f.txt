My little eyes
Are you ready to disappear?
Oh, you dance
Like a feral thing, all by yourself

You have warmth
Now I'll wait, you're just feral
To be found
My little eyes, you've come for us, resolved
But when you cared for the world and you thought

My little eyes
You can never pale into grey
So await to be loyal and pat your paths

You have warmth
Now I'll wait, you're just feral
To be found

Ah, and you cared for the world until you fold
And if you if you go miraculously to places with
So turn around and only walk
Grab me your love
Grab me your love
Grab me your love
Grab me your love
Grab me your love
