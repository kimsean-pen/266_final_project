I know the truth, but I wanna hear it from you
It's so unattractive, watching you lie like you do
Didn't know what I was in for the day we met
Now I wanna take back all of the time I invest

So if you can hear me now
Then baby, baby I hope that you cry your eyes out
You should cry until you make a river
deep enough to motherfucking drown in
If you can hear me now
Cry your eyes out
So I can waterfall out of love

Loyal to someone that didn't play on my team
I'm sick to my stomach at how selfish you could be
The first time that it happened, I should've left
Cause now I'm looking back at all of the years I regret

So if you can hear me now
Then baby, baby I hope that you cry your eyes out
You should cry until you make a river
deep enough to motherfucking drown in
If you can hear me now
Cry your eyes out
So I can waterfall out of love

Yeah, out of love
Cry
You should cry your eyes out
Cry

If you can hear me now
Then baby, baby I hope that you cry your eyes out
You should cry until you make a river
deep enough to motherfucking drown in
If you can hear me now
Cry your eyes out
So I can waterfall out of love

Don't you let them get dry
Cry like I'm crying inside
Oh, look what you did with your lies, lies
So I hope you cry
