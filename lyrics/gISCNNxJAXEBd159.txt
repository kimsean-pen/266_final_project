Suddenly --
You were gone
From all the lives
You left your mark upon

I remember --
How we talked and drank
Into the misty dawn
-- I hear the voices

We ran by the water
On the wet summer lawn
-- I see the foot prints
I remember --

-- I feel the way you would
-- I feel the way you would
-- I feel, I feel the way you would

Tried to believe
But you know it's no good
This is something
That just can't be understood

I remember --
The shouts of joy
Skiing fast through the woods
-- I hear the echoes

I learned your love for life
I feel the way that you would
-- I feel your presence
I remember --

I feel the way you would
I feel the way you would
I feel, I feel the way you would
This just can't be understood...

I tried to believe
But you know it's no good
This is something
That just can't be understood

I remember --
I feel the way you would
I feel the way you would
I feel, I feel the way you would
This just can't be understood...
