You say your love for me has waned from the storm
Your passions have fallen from the flames of old
If ever you loved me if ever at all
And our souls are tied forever more

Well I got stopped at terminal four the other day
They said I looked like a terrorist at play
I told them to believe it
I'm here to cause seizures
Staring at the demons in the darkest and the deepest
Well I'm a lion in the haze and a lamb in the lightening
All the spears and chains and flames around my neck are tightening
So line up your armies burn down my home please
Take the breath that's in my lungs and the song I'm singing

You say your love for me has waned from the storm
Your passions have fallen from the flames of old
If ever you loved me if ever at all
Our souls are tied forever more

Of course there is another place where my heart will learn again to beat
Another land another king where I will need to sing
But my soul can't be yours can't be bought by gold
All the lovers in the land know the wise man from the fool

Cause there ain't no soul in this empty sea
Competition for the darkness to be the kings and queens
Cause darkness is found as an absence of light
You believe there is no devil cause he roped you in so tight

You say your love for me has waned from the storm
Your passions have fallen from the days of old
If ever you loved me if ever at all
Our souls are tied forever more

All I want is on my mind and
All you were was some of my time
I didn't know what it is to be alive
