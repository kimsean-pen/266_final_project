Take one to the mountain
Take one to the sea
Take one to the belly of the beast
and then you'll take one with me

Shut it, shut it on

Freezing in the fires
when I utter howl your name
once you return from the belly of the beast
you're never quite the same

Shut it, shut it on,
Shut it, shut it on,

fire on the mountain
and it rages out of control
the fire inside the belly of the beast
well it thunderizes your soul
Shut it, shut it on
