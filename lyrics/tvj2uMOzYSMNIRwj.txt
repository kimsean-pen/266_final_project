Sweet child in time
You'll see the line
The line that's drawn between
Good and bad
See the blind man
Shooting at the world
Bullets flying
Ohh taking toll
If you've been bad
Oh Lord I bet you have
And you've not been hit
Oh by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes
Ooohhhh bow your head
Wait for the ricochet
I wanna hear you sing
Sweet child in time
You'll see the line
The line that's drawn between
Good and bad
See the blind man
Shooting at the world
Bullets flying
Ohh taking toll
If you've been bad
Lord I bet you have
And you've not been hit
Oh by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes
Ooohhhh bow your head
Wait for the ricochet
I gotta hear you screaming
Oh God, no
They gonna shoot me
