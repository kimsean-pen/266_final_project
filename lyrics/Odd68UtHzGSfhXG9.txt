Deprivation of my sleep
is so bad
I need to weep
myself into a coma

And drift far far away
from reality

sing me a lullaby
"Summertime"

I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming

Temporary failure to close my eyes
leeds to a final
loss of sanity
I need to slip
into a deep sunken sleep

And drift far, far away
from reality

I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming...
