Springtime comes and the leaves are back on the trees again
The snipers are harder to see my friend
Weeding out your weekends

Summer comes the gravity undoes you
You're happy because the lovely way the sunshine bends
Hiding in the deep end
weeding out your weekend

Candy left over from Halloween
The Unified theory of everything
Love left over from lovers leaving
Books they all know they're not worth reading
It's not for the season

When autumn comes you sit in your chair and you stare at the TV Square
Hiding from your close friends
Weeding out your weekends

When winter comes the days off start late
There's Motion on the boughs were the dark shapes prowl
Feeling all your feelings
feeling all your feeling

Candy left over from Halloween
The Unified theory of everything
Love left over from lovers leaving
Books they all know they're not worth reading
they're not worth reading
