God gave me travelling shoes
God gave me the wanderer's eye
God gave a few gold coins to help me to the other side
Looked around and said, be careful how the small things grow
God gives me travelling shoes
And I knew that it was time to go

He then sent in the ship at night
To take me to the hidden port
Found me the key at last
To open up the prison door
Brought down blackbirds wings
Gifted me with beggars eyes
Sent in the jackals
To tell me I should say bye, bye, bye

I'm home
Home
Home, home, home
And I'm home
Home
Home, home, home

But I'm miles and miles, and miles, and miles, and miles away
Oh where can I hide?
God gave me one last chance
Gave me one last reprieve
Jah gave me hunger
Gave me the air to breath
Gave me one suit case
Gave me one last goodbye
Gave me travelling shoes
Without them I would surely die, die, die

Home
Home
Home, home, home
Home
Home
Home, home, home
Miles and miles, and miles, and miles, and miles away
Miles and miles, and miles, and miles, and miles away
Oh where I go?
Oh where can I hide?
Home
Home
Home, home, home

And I'm home
Home
Home, home, home
And I'm miles away
Miles away
I'm running miles away
