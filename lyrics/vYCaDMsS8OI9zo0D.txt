Well, if I am a dog, the party is on
I gotta get my groove 'cause my mind done gone
Do you see the rays comin' from my eye
Walkin' through the place that Digi-man is breakin' it down?
Me and my white short shorts
And I can't see color, any color will do
I'll stick on you, that's why they call me 'Pit bull'
'Cause I'm the man of the land
When they see me they say,? Who?
