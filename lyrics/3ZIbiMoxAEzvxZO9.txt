Tell the best of it
Tell the best of it
Tell the best of it
How I say

The waste of suns
The sight of wrongs
The seasons wait for you
Oh, I waited for you
Coming down

Tell the best of it
Tell the best of it
Tell the best of it
How I say

The saviour's own
Like sleeping homes
Dark words, loss
Dark grace's cost
To stay with me
To stay to see
Til the fire

Tell the best of it
Tell the best of it
Tell the best of it
How I say

Tell the best of it
Tell the best of it
Tell the best of it
How I say

Tell the best of it
Tell the best of it
Tell the best of it
How I say

Tell the best of it
Tell the best of it
Tell the best of it
How I say

Tell the best of it
Tell the best of it
Tell the best of it
How I say
