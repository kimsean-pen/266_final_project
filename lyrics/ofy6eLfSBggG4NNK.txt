Oh, how about a round of applause?
Yeah, standing ovation
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show
You really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing

That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Grab your clothes and get gone
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (come on)
Talking, about "girl, I love you you're the one"
This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on?

And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show
You really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing

That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

And the award for the best liar goes to you
For making me believe
That you could be
Faithful to me, let's hear your speech out

How about a round of applause?
Standing ovation

But you put on quite a show
You really had me going
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing

That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

But it's over now
