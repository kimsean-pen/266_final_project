High noon, oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breaking my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides, why he's lighter than air

Oh I see his face
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
I believe, yes, I believe

In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many die
We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
But don't know why

Now where do we go?

Hot wind moving fast across the desert
We feel that our time has arrived
The world spins while we put his wing together
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky

Oh I see his face
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, far?
When do we leave?
Hey, I believe, I believe

In the heat and the rain
With the whips and chains
Just to see him fly
Too many die
We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly
But we don't know why

Oh, now where do we go?

All eyes see the figure of the wizard
As he climbs to the top of the world
No sound as he falls instead of rising
Time standing still, then there's blood on the sand

Oh I see his face
Where was your star?
Was it far? Was it far?
When did we leave?
We believed, we believed, we believed

In heat and rain
With the whips and chains
To see him fly
So many died
We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly

But why
In all the rain
With all the chains
Did so many die
Just to see him fly
Look at my flesh and bone
Now look, look, look, look
Look at his tower of stone
I see a rainbow rising
Look there on the horizon
And I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

Time is standing still
He give back my will
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Going home
I'm going home
My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is lead ahead
The place I've known
But it's not home
Oh

Take me back
He give me back my will
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Going home
I'm going home
My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is lead ahead
The place I've known
But it's not home
Oh

Take me back
Take me back
Back to my home
Oh, oh, oh
