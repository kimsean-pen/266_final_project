Sometimes I get up feeling good but greed gets me down,
I try to think about the highs, the freedom we've found,
When the business in your life don't sit with your soul,
And they treat you like a child they need to control.

The music that we make will heal all our mistakes and lead us,
The music that we hear is always standing near to feed us.

We're all gonna rise above all things that we lack,
Good vibrations that we make will come bouncing back.

The music that we make will heal all our mistakes and lead us,
The music that we hear is always standing near to feed us.

The music that we make will heal all our mistakes and lead us,
The music that we hear is always standing near to feed us.

The music that we make will heal all our mistakes and lead us,
The music that we hear is always standing near to feed us.
