Oh woah oh ohh oh
Accidentally, on purpose
I dropped my watch behind the tire
Threw my alarm clock inside the fireplace, yeah
And I put the parental control on
On the news and the weather channel

I'm outside in my robe, I'm looking for you, oh
If every thing'd stop, I'd listen for your heart
To lead me right to you, yeah
I tried every way I can

But it's harder to hold on to your hands
Than the hands of time, I need a hand, girl
I'm trying to hold on
Losing strength in these hands of mine
I need you here
I'm trying to hold on
I'm standing here, open hands
And I, know I can't do this alone
Hold on, hold on, lemme hold on
(Hold on to my hands)
(Can you) Hold on to my hands

(Don't let go of my hands)
Don't let go
I don't think this is working
Freezing so hard, my hands are hurting
Ought to let go in the first place, yeah
And I put the phone on the front lawn
Everything that shows time is gone

I'm outside in this cold still looking for you
Ohh oh
If every thing'd stop, I'd listen for your heart
To lead me right to you, yeah

I tried every way I can
But it's harder to hold on to your hands
Than the hands of time, I need a hand, girl
I'm trying to hold on
Losing strength in these hands of mine
I need you here
I'm trying to hold on
I'm standing here, open hands
And I, know I can't do this alone
Hold on, hold on, lemme hold on

(Hold on to my, my hands, yeah)
(Don't let go of my hands)
Don't ever let me go
(Hold on to my, my hands, yeah)

(Don't let go of my hands)
If every thing'd stop, I'd listen for your heart
To lead me right to you, yeah
I tried every way I can
But it's harder to hold on to your hands
Than the hands of time, I need a hand, girl
I'm trying to hold on
Losing strength in these hands of mine
I need you here
I'm trying to hold on
I'm standing here, open hands
And I, know I can't do this alone
Hold on, hold on, lemme hold on
(Hold on to my hands)
Can you hold on to my hands?
(Don't let go of my hands)
Don't let go
(Hold on to my hands)
Can you hold on to my hands?
(Don't let go of my hands)
Baby, hold on
(Hold on my hands)
Ohh oh
