Is it easy for ya if I took time?
Would you feel secure if I told you everything on my mind?
Imagination can take its toll
Let it run wild with some time, it'll turn you cold

Had enough night
You savin' up your feelings 'til it feels right, hm hm
Put up a good fight
If you can't throw a punch, then it don't feel right

'Cause you can't cover it up anymore (ooh ooh ooh)
You gotta play or don't show up, no
(Are you strong enough?)
And you're comin' on so tough, are you sure (ooh ooh ooh)
You're strong enough to stay on my mind? Oh
(Are you strong enough?)
Are you strong enough to stay on my mind?
(Strong enough, strong enough)
Are you strong enough to stay on my mind?

We're way too young to even know
If we're a moment, if we're better alone
Don't make a promise if you're gonna run
Give me no option, you're not strong enough

Had some good times
Sendin' all our feelings through a phone line, hmm hmm
Put up a good fight
If you can't throw a punch, then it don't feel right

'Cause you can't cover it up anymore (ooh ooh ooh)
You gotta play or don't show up, oh
(Are you strong enough?)
And you're comin' on so tough, are you sure (ooh ooh ooh)
You're strong enough to stay on my mind? Oh
(Are you strong enough?)
Strong enough to stay on my mind?
(Make me crave your love)
So I miss you when you're not by my side
(Can you keep up?)
Keep me hangin' on until our bodies touch
(Strong enough, strong enough)
Are you strong enough?

You say: Give in to me, give in to me
But I don't play that nice
You say: Give in to me, give in to me
But will you pay the price?

'Cause you can't cover it up anymore
You gotta play or don't show up, baby
(Are you strong enough?)
And you're comin' on so tough, are you sure (ooh ooh ooh)
You're strong enough to stay on my mind?
(Are you strong enough?)
Strong enough to stay on my mind?
(Make me crave your love)
So I miss you when you're not by my side
(Can you keep up?)
Keep me hangin' on until our bodies touch
(Strong enough, strong enough)
Are you strong enough? Oh

(Can you keep up?)
Keep me hangin' on until our bodies touch
Are you strong enough?
