Good times gone
And you missed them
What's gone wrong
In your system
Things they bounce
Like a Spalding
What'd you think
Did you miss your calling
It's so free
This kind of feeling
It's like life
It's so appealing
When you've got so much to say
It's called gratitude & that's right!

Good times gone
But you feed it
Hate's grown strong
You feel you need it
Just one thing
Do you know
what you think
That the world owes you
What's gonna set you free
Look inside and you'll see
When you've got so much to say
It's called gratitude & that's right!
