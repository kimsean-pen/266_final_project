Don't know what to do, any-more
I've lost the only love worth fightin' for
And I'll drown in my tear storm-en sea
And that would show you
That would make you hurt like me

All the same...
I don't want mud-slinging games
It's just a shame-
To let you walk away
Is there a chance a fragment of light
at the end of the tunnel a reason to fight
Is there a chance you might change your mind
Or are we ashes and wine?
Oooohhh...
Don't know if our fate's already sealed
This day's a spinning, circus on a wheel

And I'm ill with the thought of your... kiss
Coffee-laced, intoxicating on her lips
Shut it out-
I've got no claim on you now

I'm not allowed -
To wear your freedom down... noo
Is there a chance a fragment of light
At the end of the tunnel a reason to fight

Is there a chance you may change your mind...
Or are we ashes and wine
And I'll tear... myself... away...
If that is what you need there is noth--thing left .to say
But-
Is there, a chance, a fragment of light at the end of the tunnel
a reason to fight
Is there ... a chance ... you may change your mind-
Or are we ashes and wine
Reduced to ashes and wine...
Or are we ashes--
