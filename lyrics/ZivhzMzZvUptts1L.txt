After school I always had to work
It kinda left me feeling like a jerk
Cause I never got to talk to the guy I liked
And that ain't right
And then he met another type
Made him buy her all the things she liked
I learned a lot about life
When she jumped in his convertible

(Singing)
Oh la da da da
Without a care in the world
Oh la da da da
I'm not that kinda girl

Rich kids
Got a lot to say
Rich kids
Never have to pay
Everything's funny when you're young with money
And mommy and daddy will pay the way

Rich kids
Never go to jail
Rich kids
Never buy on sale
Rich kids always have the most fun
Man I wish that I was one

A little later on in life
When finally I get my money right
It's still never enough
For the stuck up types

They say my money's new
And she's got a better view
As they sail away on their fathers yacht
(This is what I got)

Oh la da da da
Without a care in the world
Oh la da da da
I'm not that kinda girl

Rich kids
Got a lot to say
Rich kids
Never have to pay
Everything's funny when you're young with money
And mommy and daddy will pay the way

Rich kids
Never go to jail
Rich kids
Never buy on sale
Rich kids always have the most fun
Man I wish that I was one

Maybe he's not for me
Maybe he did me a favor
Maybe you saved me some trouble down the line
But maybe she's just like me
Baby it's what they mean
Don't judge a book by the cover

...
Rich kids
Got a lot to say
Rich kids

Rich kids never go to jail
Rich kids never buy on sale
Everything's funny when you're young with money
And mommy and daddy will pay the way
Rich kids
Never go to jail
Rich kids

Rich kids always have the most fun
Man I wish that I was one
