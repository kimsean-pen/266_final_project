I know you like to wear my dressing gown,
When i'm not there.
I guess you like it in my shoes.

Just coz you drive a Maserati
And the ladies stare
Don't mean you'll go as fast as i do.

I know it's summer in the city
And the sun is high
But you can play it cool again
Coz boy i seen you disco dancing
With your pants on fire
We need a little tropical rain

So baby, baby
Watch the needle when your heading south
You drive me crazy
Just remember you can burn me out
Slow it down...

It's been a long, hot summer
And it's 95 degrees in the shade
It's only Sunday morning
And I need that Friday feeling again

You put me in a fever 50 stories high
And suddenly i'm freezing
And i don't know why
It's been a long, hot summer
And i'm shaking like a cool lemonade

If you wanna get fresh
Get outta my car
Coz the boys like you are going too fast
I'm taking my time now

If you wanna fly high
Keep outta the sun
When your fingers start to burn
It's no fun
So why don't you climb down

If you wanna get fresh
Then take a cold shower
Put your back on ice
Before you turn sour
Nobody can fool me

Now i'm cleaning my head
And dusting my eyes
Every time i feel the temperature rise
I need you to cool me

I'm partied out of house and home
So baby if you fight me
How you gonna like me

Runnin down that Old Kent Road
So think before you bite me
How you gonna get back home

It's been a long, hot summer
And it's 95 degrees in the shade
It's only Sunday morning
And i need that Friday feeling again

You put me in a fever 50 stories high
And suddenly i'm freezing
And i don't know why
Its's been a long, hot summer
And i'm shaking like a cool lemonade

Cos I-I
I might be
So why-y
Do you fight me?

Cos I-I
I might be
So why-y
Do you fight me?

A little late
To take it slow
But I couldn't wait
To party

Like a cannonball
Got what I wanted
Now I've seen it all
So find me

I've ricocheted
(Pa-pa-paaa)
Around the world
Drinking pink champagne
It's easy

Turn the heat too high
(Pa-pa-paaa)
It's what I wanted
But I just can't lie
Now I'm queasy

Pa-pa-paaa
Pa-pa-paaa
Pa-pa-paaa
Pa-pa-paaa
