What doesn't kill you, leaves you dead
But it's all inside your head
If you feel like you were drift away
Hold on to me instead

And though we don't know where we'll end up
I know we've got to trust in the wind,
Don't you give in, leave it all up to
I'll be your star when you look up,
The one you would follow
I will never let you down
'Cause I'm your ANCHOR
I'm your ANCHOR
I'm your ANCHOR
I'm your ANCHOR

Let your words fall from your skin
Let them sinking, you can swim
If you walk then we can sail away
And find a sanctuary within

And though we don't know where we'll end up
I know we've got to trust in the wind,
Don't you give in, leave it all up to
I'll be your star when you look up,
The one you would follow
I will never let you down
'Cause I'm your ANCHOR
I'm your ANCHOR
I'm your ANCHOR
I'm your ANCHOR

All those times you lose your grip
You know I'll never let you slip
and if you feel like you can't carry on
I'd be the line to keep you strong
'Cause I, I, I
And though we don't know where we'll end up
I know we've got to trust in the wind
