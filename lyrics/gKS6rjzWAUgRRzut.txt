Fuck Fuck Fuuuck
Don't know when it got this way
Don't know how long she's gonna stay
Every week it's the same in her room

That's why I came
Oh Here I go, I go again
Our rendezvous never seem to end
Know where I'll be, make this confession

Back in her bed for another goddamn
Session! I'll never learn
Session! God knows I try
Session! Keep coming back for session and I don't know why
Session! I'll never learn
Session! I'll never see

Session! Just tell me why these sessions got a hold on me
Some might say it's a fling
All I know is you don't mean a thing
Either way, can't complain
Ain't no strings

I guess I got it made
Oh here I go, go again
Our little things never seem to end
Know where I'll be
Make this confession

Back in her bed for another goddamn
Session! I'll never learn
Session! God knows I try
Session! Keep coming back for session and I don't know why
Session! I'll never learn
Session! I'll never see

Session! Just tell me why these sessions got a hold on, got another hold on me
Oh here I go, go again
Our little things never seem to end
Know where I'll be
Make this confession
Back in her bed for another goddamn
Session! I'll never learn
Session! God knows I try
Session! Keep coming back for session and I don't know why
Session! I'll never learn
Session! I'll never see
Session! Just tell me why these sessions got a hold on, got another hold on me
