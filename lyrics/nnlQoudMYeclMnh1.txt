Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to a lake of fire and fry
Won't see 'em again till the 4th of July

Oh, I knew a lady who came from Duluth
Who got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave, a little too soon
And flew away howlin' on the yellow moon

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to a lake of fire and fry
Won't see 'em again till the 4th of July

Now people cry and people moan
Look for a dry place to call their home
Try find some place to rest their bones
Before the angels and the devils fight to make 'em their own

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to a lake of fire and fry
Won't see 'em again till the 4th of July
