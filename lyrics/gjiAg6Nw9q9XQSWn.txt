I'll take you
Out of the past, out of the deep
Whatever
Whatever wars you like to keep

Somehow you
Keep falling back into the dark

I'll take you
I'll take you back to where we are

Come with me
'cause we can't breathe when we're so low

Hold on now
I can not help when you let go

The black
The fear
The night

The light
The wall
And black
She falls

The black
The fear
The night

The light
The wall
And black
She falls

(Female voice: I'm sorry I have to
find the missing bits of the trust I have lost)

I'm waiting
I know you're coming from afar

I'll take you
I'll take you down to where we are
