You came to me within a dream
Not everyone is who they seem
All these words we can't redeem
Like the great magic of our world
Corroborated by your words
Splitting planets into thirds

Baby, oh baby
Baby, my baby
Baby, oh babe
I miss you, la, la, la, la
Baby, oh baby
Baby, my babe
Baby, oh babe
I miss you

To all the leaves that fall in vain
While God and Goddess go insane
All these words in your domain
The watches kill time as the books read
Inadvertently we bleed
Fighting for what we deceive

Baby, oh baby
Baby, my baby
Baby, oh babe
I miss you, la, la, la, la
Baby, oh baby
Baby, my babe
Baby, oh babe
I miss you

Leave me alone, leave me alone
Now why can't you see that you always perturb me?
So nearing the end of the world
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Why can't you see that you always perturb me?
So nearing the end of the world
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Baby, oh baby

Baby, my baby
Baby, oh babe
I miss you, la, la, la, la
Baby, oh baby
Baby, my babe
Baby, oh babe
I miss you
