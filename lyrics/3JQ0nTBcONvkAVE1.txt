Take it from me, from me
It's the territory
In the leaves, the trees
The woods that give us peace
And someone, somewhere
Is watching
Someone, somewhere
Is watching you

Wherever you are
No matter how far
Just lead

There, that's it
Woke up dead
There, that's it
Woke up dead

I can feel it
I can feel it in the air
In the air
I can feel it
I can feel air

Take it from me, from me
That we'll never sleep
From me, from me
They're the ones that gave
Bought and sold everything you own
Bought and sold everything you own

The truth lies in where you hide
The truth lies in where you

Wherever you are
No matter how far
Just lead

Lead us to the water
Lead us to the end
Lead us to the water
Lead us until death

That's it
Woke up dead
There, that's it
Woke up dead

And I can feel it
I can feel it in the air
In the air, I can feel it
I can feel it

Go ghost, lead
Go ghost, lead

Wherever you are
No matter how far
Just leave 'till you lead

Lead us to the end
Lead us to the end

I can
Feel it, I can feel it
In the air, in the air
I can feel it, I can feel it

Love the one whose past was broke
I'm the one who never knows
Look at you without your clothes
I draw the line here

Go ghost, lead
Go ghost, lead
Go ghost, lead
Go ghost, lead
Go ghost, lead
Go ghost, lead
Go ghost, lead
Go ghost
