I wish I was in Carrighfergus,
Only for nights in Ballygrant
I would swim over the deepest ocean,
Only for nights in Ballygrant.

But the sea is wide, and I can't get over.
And neither have I wings to fly,
Or if I could find me a handsome boatsman
To ferry me over to my love and die.

Now in Kilkenny, it is reported,
They've marble stones there as black as ink
With gold and silver I would transport her
But I'll sing no more now, till I get a drink.

I'm drunk today, but then I'm seldom sober.
A handsome rover from town to town.
Ah, but I am sick now, my days are over,
Come all you young lads and lay me down.

I wish I was in Carrighfergus,
Only for nights in Ballygran.
