[Aubrey]
When I stand in a crowded room
I feel alone like nobody's there
And when you talk cold to me
I can see your breath in the air
It's taking it's toll on me
In the bathroom taking showers
So you don't see me cry
Baby it's such a crime

[Dawn]
I try to feel confident
I'm bitter - You're not making sense
I missed you 'til you almost took my sanity
I started a new verse like

[DK]
Poetry, you're hiding behind the words you speak
Changing the words of the story
You say you don't love me then say that you love me
I'm fighting
You're hiding behind the words you're speaking
You're changing the words, I'm lost in the verse
You say you don't love me then say that you love me
Why are you hiding?

[D. Woods]
When I give you gratitude
You act like you don't hear me speak
When I tell you what you do to me
You don't even hear the truth
What are you trying to prove; I stare out of the window for hours
Cause you don't listen to me
You won't even look in my eyes

[Dawn]
I try to feel confident
I'm bitter - You're not making sense
I missed you 'til you almost took my sanity
I started a new verse like

[DK]
Poetry, you're hiding behind the words you speak
Changing the words of the story
You say you don't love me then say that you love me
I'm fighting
You're hiding behind the words you're speaking
You're changing the words, I'm lost in the verse
You say you don't love me then say that you love me
Why are you hiding?

[Aundrea]
Don't believe what you're saying
I read your face and I'm blanking
Cause I don't know what's in front of my eyes
I try to feel confident

[Dawn & Aundrea]
I try to feel confident
I'm bitter - You're not making sense
I missed you 'til you almost took my sanity

Oh. oh. oh. oh...
Oh. oh. oh. oh...
