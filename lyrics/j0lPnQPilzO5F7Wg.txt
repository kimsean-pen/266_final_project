You got it all wrong, you think I'm indestructible
But I can tell you right now, with losing my mind I'm losing my money
And I'm feeling sick but I think I'm getting used to it
And I've been taking trips, out of my head and out of my body
Losing myself and loving no one

I'd like, to say, I'm better off without you
But I can't, no way, you won't believe me
At nights, I drift, like a bottle in the ocean
'My Citalopram' will pull me through

Well I know it's all wrong just a, weak minded individual
But I can tell you right now, I know I ain't weak, I aim to get better
But I must admit, that I fear I can't get over it
But time only will tell
I barely feel sad, I rarely feel happy
Pop those pills and settle down

I'd like, to say, I'm better off without you
But I can't, no way, you won't believe me
At nights, I drift, like a bottle in the ocean
'My Citalopram' will pull me though

I can't stop smoking and drinking with the mess I'm in
I need something stronger than your medicine
I know it's not healthy but I just can't quit
I can't win

I'd like, to say, I'm better off without you
But I can't, no way, you won't believe me
At nights, I drift, like a bottle in the ocean
'My Citalopram' will pull me though

I can't stop smoking and drinking with the mess I'm in
I need something stronger than your medicine
I know it's not healthy but I just can't quit
I can't win
