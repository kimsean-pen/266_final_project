We live in a time bomb that's ticking down
The red and green wires have faded to brown
There's no way of knowing if we'll survive
But 'til we hit zero I'm going to try

It could all end tomorrow
so let's live it up tonight

Just drive!
Time is waiting race the light
They'll read about us when we die
Don't stop for anything tonight
The world is ending so just drive

I'm not one for luck or circumstance
I know that I won't get a second chance
I never was one to hold my tongue
But sometimes my brain doesn't give me one

It could all end tomorrow
so let's live it up tonight

Just drive!
Time is waiting race the light
They'll read about us when we die
Don't stop for anything tonight
The world is ending so just drive

oh woah, oh woah, oh oh oh oh
oh woah, oh woah, oh oh oh oh
oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh woah
oh woah, oh woah, oh

Just drive!
Time is waiting race the light
They'll read about us when we die
Don't stop for anything tonight
The world is ending so just drive
