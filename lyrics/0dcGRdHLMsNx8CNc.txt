Through these eyes we shook the world
Through these eyes we fought the world
Through these eyes we shook the world
Through these eyes we fought the world

Through these eyes we shock the world
No fear at all, went headstrong
Aggravations, hostility
But there's a difference, we are free

In my eyes a line divided
So choose a side, stand united
Divide and fall, reflections of what we have done
There's no shame, but there's pride

Fought for everything, we did what we have to do
There is a purpose for this fight, in the end I know it's right

We are free, we are free!

In my eyes, see strong conviction
Laid to rest, all doubts are dead
Fought for everything, we did what we have to do
There is a purpose for this fight, in the end I know it's right

There is a purpose for this fight, in the end it's right
There is a purpose for this fight, in the end it's right
