I gotta protect my heart
I gotta protect my heart

(Kelis)
You were the heart of the spot
But you wouldn't tell me your name
You were like
Girl you ready or not
To dance the entire night away
You and I

(Pharrell)
Let me hold you girl, hold you girl
(Kelis)
You were sayin
(Pharrell)
Let me touch it girl
(Kelis)
You were sayin
(Pharrell)
Let me squeeze you girl, squeeze you girl
(Kelis)
You tought me up
(Pharrell)
Let me you girl

(Kelis)
So when I first got here I knew already
I gotta protect my heart
Make all changes, new desitions and flip it
I gotta protect my heart

The room is Oh so hot
If you want more than that than walk away
I'm givin it all I got
And at the same time tryin to make ten

(Kelis)
You were sayin
(Pharrell)
Let me hold you girl, hold you girl
(Kelis)
You were sayin
(Pharrell)
Let me touch it girl
(Kelis)
You were sayin
(Pharrell)
Let me squeeze you girl, squeeze you girl
(Kelis)
You tought me up
(Pharrell)
Let me you girl

(Kelis)
So when I first got here I knew already

Never been touched by the way someone woo's and that scares me
