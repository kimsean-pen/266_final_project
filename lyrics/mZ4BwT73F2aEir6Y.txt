Prepare yourself for stormy weather
Nothing gets much better in the rain

If she want to go then let her
Off this runway train
There's no scape

Hold me
I can't go home
Control me
I'll do what you want

It's a fantasy of felling
Everyday just feels the same

Our lives have lost all meaning
On this runaway train
This runaway

Hold me
I can't go home
Control me
I'll do what you want
Hold me
I can't go home
Control me
I'll do what you want
