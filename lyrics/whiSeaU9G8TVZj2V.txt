Well, we're just two ships passing through the night
Two lost lonely people inside
I wanted to hold you tight or get away

Your eyes don't look close to mine
Lonely times and the people the same
You've seen what you've been
And you mean what you say, and you say what it is

Just take it back, take it back
What we had, take it

I wanna hold you tight
But these days turn so lonely tonight
I wanna kiss your lips and get away

Sometimes lonely people change
And these days get so lonely in May
I try so hard to make what I can't seem to say
And these days get so far away, and I want what I can't say

So take it back

Oh, it's gonna come a day
Oh, it's gonna come a day

So take it back, take it back
So take it back, take it, no, no, no

Well, we're just two ships passing through the night
Two lost lonely people inside
I wanted your touch, but you can't feel my fingers; I can't say too much

So I try, try to get away, oh Lord, why did I stay?
Oh, you got this little lonely-hearted man
And you cry all the time, and I know
That these days, they don't go where they go
And I can't feel my hands anymore

So take it back, take it back
What we had, take it back
Just take it back, take it back
What we had, just take it
Just take it, just take it back
