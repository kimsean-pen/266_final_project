Well, Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Speed jive, don't want to stay alive
When you're 25
And Wendy's stealing clothes from Marks and Sparks
And Freddy's got spots from ripping off the stars from his face
Funky little boat race
Television man is crazy, saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh, man, I need TV when I got T. Rex
Oh, brother
I'm a dude, man

All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news

Now, Lucy looks sweet 'cause he dresses like a queen
But he can kick like a mule, it's a real mean team
But we can love, oh, we can love
And my brother's back at home with his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag, too many snags
Now I've drunk a lot of wine and I'm feeling fine
Got to race some cat to bed
Is there concrete all around, or is it in my head?
Yeah, I'm a dude, man

All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
