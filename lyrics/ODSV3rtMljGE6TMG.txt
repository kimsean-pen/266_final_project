Adventure seeker on an empty street,
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger can't see a way out
"It isn't much I'm asking," I heard him say
"Got to find me a future. Move out of my way"
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now

Listen all you people, come gather round
I got to get me a game plan, got to shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine
People do you hear me? Just give me the sign
It isn't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
I'm a man with a one-track mind
So much to do in one lifetime (people do you hear me?)
Not a man for compromise and 'wheres' and 'whys' and living lies
So I'm living it all (yes I'm living it all)
And I'm giving it all (and I'm giving it all)

It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
I want it
I want it, I want it!
