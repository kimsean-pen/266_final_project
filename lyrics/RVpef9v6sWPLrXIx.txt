Dead calm
Cold steam
I saw you in a dark and recurring dream
An inner journey
To wake the leaping flame
The memory of ages overcame
The spur of the moment
See who is friend and foe
The common feelings long ago

A voyage of discovery
To find the real me

I'll be a part of you
The memory I renew
The rite of shiantara
I stand here
Eye to eye, face to face
I take this place
In the rite of shiantara

Look deep
Beyond
And find the reason why you can't break the bond
This path continues
Emotional, intense
The way to gain a renewed sense

A bag of memories I have
Prized as vintage wine
It seems to strike a chord in me enshrine

I'll be a part of you
The memory I renew
The rite of shiantara
I stand here
Eye to eye, face to face
I take this place
In the rite of shiantara

Shiantara, shiantara
Shiantara, shiantara

I'll be
I'll be a part of you
The memory I renew
The rite of shiantara
I stand here
Eye to eye, face to face
I take this place
In the rite of shiantara
