There's a hosue on a hill and a driveway
I see a busted angel, looking my way
Oh no, stay low, "grey crows"
It ain't your business what I wanna do now

OH
I don't wanna take a bow WOAH
'Cause I've been dreaming for a while OH
I settle with the butterflies NO
Denial's going out of style WOAH

Since I can't forget
Why I went for it OH
Then why don't we just make it now NO
Ain't no need to wait it

I fly with the angels in my zoo
Try reaching out of the wild moon
Ruin clouds
Just do it now
Play on through it
(Make it now)

High with the feeling in this flume
Try swimming out at the wild moon
Ruin clouds
do it now
Wave on through it

I'm an angel in a raincoat OH
Driving in a Range Rov' OH
I always were the same "clothes" NO
Stranger than my dress code WOAH

In my blind ambition kit
Tissues don't regret
So why don't we just make it now
Ain't no need to wait it out

I fly with the angels in my zoo
Try reaching out of the wild moon
Ruin clouds
Just do it now
Play on through it
(Make it now)

High with the feeling in this flume
Try swimming out at the wild moon
Ruin clouds
do it now
Wave on through it

Angels come and go
Don't let ambition lead you blind
I'm taken out of time
Can't go flying with a crow
I can't, gotta leave the house
I gotta leave it now
'cause I'm on it, on it, on it, on it
I'm on it
HA du du du du
On it, on it, I'm on it
I fly away now
Promise you to wave

I fly with the angels in my zoo
Try reaching out of the wild moon
Ruin clouds
Just do it now
Play on through it
(Make it now)

High with the feeling in this flume (HEY)
Try swimming out at the wild moon
Ruin clouds
do it now
Wave on through it

TAKE IT ALL
