Cops killing blacks
And blacks killing blacks
Shit just gonna get worse
They just gonna become souljas

Crack done took apart of our family tree
my momma's on tha shit, my dadies splitten, mom's steady blaming me
is it my fault, just 'cause i'm a young black male
cop sweat me as if my destiny is making crack sells
only 15 and got problems
cops on my tail, so I bail till I dodge 'em
they finally pull me over and I laugh
remember Rodney King and I blast on his punk ass
now I gotta murder case
you speak a' Heaven punk, I never heard of tha place
what is it ta come up fast, got a Uz and a black mask
drop tha fucking task, now who's tha jack ass
keep my shit cocked, cause tha cops got a glock too
what tha fuck would you do
drop them or let 'em drop you
I chose dropping tha cop
I got me a glock, and a glock for tha niggas on my block
4 of 'em tried ta stab me, I moved out
sold a pound a weed, made g's, bought a new house
i'm only 17, I'm tha new kid
I got me a crew, bought 'em jewels, and a uzi
but all good things don't last
task came fast, and busted my black ass
coolen in tha pen, where tha goods kept

now my little brother wants ta follow in my footsteps
a soulja

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

Buck, buck, pigs get fucked, don't step ta this
Quiet has kept them blessed, on a quest with a death wish
Tell 'em they come and test, and tha rest, nigga gets hectic
Here's tha aneirexic, i'm making it to an exit
Walking through tha streets on tha black tip
Packed with several gats, 'cause i'm also paying back shit
Niggas don't wanna try me, brother you'll get shot down
Now i'm kick'en tha block, cause my bigger brothers locked down
I'm hot now, so many punk police have got shot down
Other cops see me on tha block, and they jock now
That's what I call a kingpin
Send my brother what he needs is some weed up ta season
Tell him just be ready set, pack ya shit up quick
And when I hit, be prepared ta jet
Niggas from tha block on tha boat now
Every single one got a gun, that'll smoke pow
These punks about ta get hit by tha best
I'm wear'en double vest, so aim at my fucking chest
I'll be making straight dome calls
Touch tha button on tha wall, you'll be picken up your own balls
I can still hear my mother shout, hit tha pig nigga
Break your bigga brother out
I got a message for tha warden
I'm coming for ya ass, as fast as Flash Gorden
We get surrounded in tha mess hall, yes ya'll
A crazy motherfucka making death calls
Just bring me my brother and we leaving
For every minute you stall, one ya'll bleeding
They brought my brother in a jiffy
I took a cop, just in case things got tricky
And just as we was walken out, I caught a bullet in tha head

Tha screams never left my mouth
My brother caught a bullet too
I think he gonna pull through, he deserve to
Tha fast life ain't everything they told ya
Never get much older, following tha tracks of a soulja

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

straight soulja, 1993, all of it.
