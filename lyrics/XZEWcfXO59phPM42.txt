I never felt the wind so cold
Until I had to walk alone without you, baby
I never knew what it was to be a man, oh no
Well, let me show you, baby 'cause now I understand, yes girl

I never thought it'd hurt so bad
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I see you like you won't know
Until you lose what you had, yes

See, I don't need to waste time
Runnin' around now all over town, baby
'Cause now I know where to find true lovin'

And I knew the first time that I ever seen you

Let us stay together, let us stay together
(Girl, it would be so nice, yeah)
Can we stay together? Let us stay together
(Ooh baby)

Just tell me why it feels so strong
The years keep rollin' by
But still this love in heart, you own
I never felt a love so completely, oh baby
Don't you know we're riding on destiny?

And I knew the first time that I ever seen you

Let us stay together, let us stay together
(Girl, it would be so nice, yeah)
Can we stay together? Let us stay together
(If we just hold on tight, yeah)

Can we stay together, let us stay together
(Girl, it would be so nice, yeah)
Can we stay together? Let us stay together
(If we just hold on tight, yeah)

Ooh girl, you got me 'cause when I wake up
You're the first thing on my mind
Tomorrow will be, so let's leave
(Leave the past behind)
Just let me lead you to our happy ever after

And girl, when we arrive
Why don't we stay awhile

Can we stay together? Let us stay together
(Girl, it would be so nice, yeah)
Can we stay together? Let us stay together
(If we just hold on tight, yeah)

Can we stay together? Let us stay together
(Girl, it would be so nice, yeah)
Can we stay together? Let us stay together
(If we just hold on tight, yeah)

Can we stay together? Let us stay together
(Girl, it would be so nice, yeah)
