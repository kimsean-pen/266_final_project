I am an accident in a game of chance
So I'll use my numbered days any way I can
I realize I was never meant to be
I am owed nothing

I have spent too much time feeling sorry for myself
Playing victim, thinking of nobody else
Giving nothing but expecting something in return
Always running from the lessons I'm supposed to learn

I learned the hard way
It's just here for a second then it all goes back
I'm missing something
The hope that we carry is all we have
I won't live in fear that at any moment it can all just disappear
I learned the hard way
We're just here for a second then we all go back
I am owed nothing

Every second of our lives is on borrowed time
So use it now cause you won't get a second try
Everything you've ever loved won't last
And anything that we use is paid back

I learned the hard way
It's just here for a second then it all goes back
I'm missing something
The hope that we carry is all we have
I won't live in fear that at any moment it can all just disappear
I learned the hard way
We're just here for a second then we all go back

In the end what we refuse to let go all becomes nothing
What we refuse to let go all becomes nothing
It's time we realized we were never meant to be
We are owed nothing

I learned the hard way
It's just here for a second then it all goes back
I'm missing something
The hope that we carry is all we have
I won't live in fear that at any moment it can all just disappear
I learned the hard way
We're just here for a second then we all go back
