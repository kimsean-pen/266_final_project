I was half in mind, I was half in need
And as the rain came down
I dropped to my knees and I prayed
I said, 'Oh heavenly thing, please cleanse my soul
I've seen all on offer and I'm not impressed at all
I was halfway home, I was half insane
And every shop window I looked in just looked the same
I said, 'Now send me a sign to save my life
'Cause at this moment in time there is nothing certain in
These days of mine'
You see it's a frightening thing when it dawns upon you
That I know as much as the day I was born
And though I wasn't asked, I might as well stay
And promise myself each and every day
That when you're knocked on your back and your life's a flop
And when you're down on the bottom there's nothing else
But to shout to the top, well we're gonna shout to the top
We're gonna shout to the top, we're gonna shout to the top
Hey, we're gonna shout to the top
You see it's a frightening thing when it dawns upon you
That I know as much as the day I was born
And though I wasn't asked, I might as well stay
And promise myself each and every day
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
So when you're knocked on your back and your life's a flop
And when you're down on the bottom there's nothing else
But to shout to the top, well, we're gonna shout to the top
We're gonna shout to the top, we're gonna shout to the top
And when you're knocked on your back and your life's a flop
And when you're down on the bottom there's nothing else
But to shout to the top, we're gonna shout to the top
We're gonna shout to the top, we're gonna shout to the top
Hey, yeah, shout to the top
Shout to the top, shout
Shout to the top, shout
Shout to the top, shout
Shout to the top, shout
Shout to the top, shout
Shout to the top, shout...
