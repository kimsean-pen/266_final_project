You want it
I know it
Heart's beating
That's for certain
Pay attention
Don't overthink it
Find your way in through the door
Get ready
I'll show you
What is behind that curtain
Deepest darkest
Yes I promise
You will be asking me for
More than you can handle
You gotta go with what you feel
It's an adventure to remember
It's undeniably unreal
I'll invite you to my world
Step inside now
Tonight I'm gonna be your girl
Let me show you how
To open up
And let it fly
Catch the sunrise in my eyes
I'll invite you to my world, my world
It's getting heated
Remain seated
This is something
You can't ignore it
I will tell you
My dirty secrets
But let me tease you just a little
More than you can handle
You gotta go with what you feel
A situation to remember
It's unbelievably unreal
I'll invite you to my world
Step inside now
Tonight I'm gonna be your girl
Let me show you how
To open up
And let it fly
Catch the sunrise in my eyes
I'll invite you to my world, my world
Step inside make your mind up
Come and go with me
(And I can show you why)
Step inside make your mind up
Come and go with me
(I'll overthrow your mind)
Step inside make your mind up
Come and go with me
(Just come across the line)
I'll be your guide
I'll invite you to my world
Step inside now
Tonight I'm gonna be your girl
Let me show you how
To open up
And let it fly
Catch the sunrise in my eyes
I'll invite you to my world, my world
