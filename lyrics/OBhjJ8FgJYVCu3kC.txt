Carpe diem...
Seize the day before your life fades away.
Reach for the skies - for the distant sun
and keep on hiding from the gun.

No! You need to sell your soul
for it's great to lose control.
Can't you feel that growing desire
to go down with the blazing fire?

You need to burn and reach to the point of no return.

- Waste no time dreaming in vain!
You and I aren't built to last
- Go astray - the only way!
You and I will make it fast
- Burn the candle at both ends!
Let's take a ride before we fall
- Leave no room for happy endings!
and make it right for once and for all.

Something's twisted in your head
for you live as you were dead.
So therefore you must play with the gun
and be sure to have your fun.

Take my hand and I'll lead you astray
for it's the only way.
Let's give in to the growing desire
and go down with the blazing fire.

We need to burn and reach the point of no return.

- Waste no time dreaming in vain!
You and I aren't built to last.
- Go astray - the only way!
You and I will make it fast
- Burn the candle at both ends!
Let's take a ride before we fall.
- Leave no room for happy endings!
And make it right for once and for all.
