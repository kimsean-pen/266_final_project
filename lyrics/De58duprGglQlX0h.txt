Don't want to see what all these people see
They all seem lost with what they've found
Don't want to hear what all these people hear
It seems to tell them there's no sound
Don't want to fight who all these people fight
It's only truth that's been denied

Does it feel too real
When everything you've learnt to love seems to change?
Does it feel too real
When everything you love to fear seems the same?

Don't want to waste away my life-savings
Too many feelings left to save
No need to talk about the other side
We learn to live our happy lives
It's so good, you see- just another day
Learn to savour all the same

Does it feel too real
When everything you've learnt to love seems to change?
Does it feel too real
When everything you love to fear seems the same?

Do you turn out the lights so you don't have to see yourself?
Do you turn out the lights so you don't have to see yourself?
Do you turn out the lights so you don't have to see yourself?

Does it feel too real
When everything you've learnt to love seems to change?
Does it feel too real
When everything you love to fear seems the same?

Does it feel too real
When everything you've learnt to love seems to change?
Does it feel too real
When everything you love to fear seems the same?

Does it feel too real?
