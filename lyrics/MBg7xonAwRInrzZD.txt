Everything goes, everything goes on your wall

Justine, you make me so bad,
cause you are the best

All over the world,
all over the world in your own bag
Justine makes me proud,
oh, you know

And you tell me what,
you tell me what,
you tell me what,
you tell me what you want

Take me away, take me away by your side
Justine, let me fight
you're my desire

All over the world,
all over the world on your own hands
Justine makes me proud,
oh, you know

And you tell me what,
you tell me what,
you tell me what,
you tell me what you want

Everytime i see
you make me feel so deep
but i should have known,
that was a little trick
