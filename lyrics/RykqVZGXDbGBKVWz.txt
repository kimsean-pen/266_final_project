Incarcerated between these worlds
Reality seems to loose its hold
We hide away and try to fill the space between these thoughts

Detached from everything that lives and breathes
Emotions just words on a screen
So fabricated is the life we lead
So fabricated is the life we lead

Side by side
You'll watch the whole world pass you by
An affliction, this addiction

Side by side
Out of sight, you're out of mind
So obsessed with imitation

Stuck living in this cycle of vanity
Will self loathing even matter if they're calling your name

Call my name
When happiness is so dependant on shallow words
Spoken from the mouths of introverts
Measuring your own self worth

Feeding your anxieties
They'll throw you to the wolves
At the slightest hint of weakness
Just don't let it defeat us

Turn a blind eye
Why should you give a fuck what they say?
I'll never give a fuck what they say
Your judgements preconceived of me
Don't waste your life living a lie
Worthless lie

Incarcerated between these worlds
Incarcerated between these worlds
These worlds
