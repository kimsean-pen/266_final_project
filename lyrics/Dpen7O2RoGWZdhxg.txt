Holding you closer
It's time that I told you
Everything's going to be fine
Know that you're leaving
And try to believe it
Take me one step at a time
If this ain't love
(Why does it feel bad?, why does it feel bad?,
Why does it feel bad?)
Why does it feel so good?
If this ain't love
(Why does it feel bad?, why does it feel bad?,
Why does it feel bad?)
Why does it feel so good?
Think of tomorrow
We beg, steal or borrow
To make all we can in the sun
While we are moving
The music is soothing
Troubles we all have begun
If this ain't love
(Why does it feel bad?, why does it feel bad?,
Why does it feel bad?)
Why does it feel so good?
If this ain't love
(Why does it feel bad?, why does it feel bad?,
Why does it feel bad?)
Why does it feel so good?
Will you remember me boy?
Remember me
Lovin' you, yeah
Just for this lifetime
You can be my pastime
Here are the rules of our play
In it together
'Til I know you better
Darling, darling now, what do you say?
If this ain't love
(Why does it feel bad?, why does it feel bad?,
Why does it feel bad?)
Why does it feel so good?
If this ain't love
(Why does it feel bad?, why does it feel bad?,
Why does it feel bad?)
Why does it feel so good?
If this ain't love
(Why does it feel bad?, why does it feel bad?,
Why does it feel bad?)
Why does it feel so good?
