Baby, baby, can't you see that I'm smilin'?
Can't you see, there's a part of me that's brand new?
Used to be, was a part of me felt like hidin'
But now it comes through

Deep in my heart
That's where the knot comes loose
Deep in my heart
I will remember you

All my lovely life I been waitin'
Hot heels anticipatin'
Another love I found
Not to let it down, down

Deep in my heart
That's where the knot comes loose
Deep in my heart
I will remember you

Baby, baby, can't you see that I'm smilin'?
Can't you see, there's a part of me that's brand new?
Used to be, was a part of me felt like hidin'
But now it comes through
Now it comes through, comes through to you
