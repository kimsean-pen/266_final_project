We're reading psalms to the dead
Lighting candles to make amends
For a voice
Never to speak again

Six feet under for what never should've been
Stop living like you walk on water
Looking down on all those left to drown

Stop living like you walk on water

Looking down on all those left to drown
And you know
I couldn't find the words before
Only if I had another day left here

I'd tell you
If I had another day

To try to take away your pain
Now you're so far out of reach
It's a lesson you can't teach

You love and you lose
I wish that you know
That it's just a lesson you can't teach

You love and you lose

I wish that you know
That it's just a lesson you can't teach
You can't teach
I've seen the scars you've tried to hide

Searching for answers when you look to the sky
Say I'm liar, say I'm a fake
I'm far from a saint
So I'll live with my mistakes
If I'm a liar, if I'm a fake
I'll take all these sins
You can burn me at the stake
I'll take all these sins
You can burn me at the stake
And you know
I couldn't find the words before
Only if I had another day left here
I'd tell you
If I had another day
To try to take away your pain
Now you're so far out of reach
It's a lesson you can't teach
You love and you lose
I wish that you know
That it's just a lesson you can't teach
You love and you lose
I wish that you know
That it's just a lesson you can't teach
Son of God, are you listening?
Son of God, can you hear my cry?
We put our faith into you
How could you just watch them die?
Son of God, are you listening?
Son of God, can you hear my cry?
We put our faith into you
How could you just watch us die?
