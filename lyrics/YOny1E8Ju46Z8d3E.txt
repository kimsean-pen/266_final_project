Everybody is talking about the girl
Who went and killed the delivery man
But she looks so kind and gentle,
It just doesn't stand to reason
I saw her right there just the other night
As stately as a slot machine
But when she looked my way
Something mad as hell came over me

Anesthesia, Mona Lisa
I've got a little gun, here comes oblivion
I never loved you, how did you find me?
The cops will never prove complicity

Now Anna
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
All good children go to heaven

I remember your face that August night
When we lied about the beautiful time to come
And that crazy old man who came much too late
And caused a chain reaction
I've been hanging out there for eleven long years
Like a church mouse wondering where the cat has gone
And looking at you now is driving me to distraction

Anesthesia, my Mona Lisa
I've got a little gun, here comes oblivion
I never loved you, how did you find me?
The cops will never prove complicity

Now Anna
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
All good children go to heaven
