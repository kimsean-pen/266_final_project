Fuck you

I am the anti hero
My entire life I've worn the number zero on my back
All that I do
Hangs above you
Crashing down
To defy and deny you

Sometimes I daydream
Of embracing the rage
Dance with the blade
Bleed you out where you lay

Amplify
All the agony
Throughout your brain
I relay
A path to change
Let it seep in
Now listen

You never met anyone like me
I fucking promise
Rock solid

Heavy lies the crown like the weight of the world
Ice cold under pressure
Throw me up on a cross

I am where I am because of who I am
You can't change me
Words don't phase me
Your bullshit social rules will never shame me

Never ever will I give up the throne

Never
Ever
Never
Ever
No

Rock solid
At the motherfuckin' top

Rock solid
Until I motherfuckin' drop

Sometimes I daydream
Of embracing the rage
Dance with the blade
Bleed you out where you lay

Bleed you out
Where you lay
Amplifying
Throughout your brain

Stone cold
Don't ever forget
No matter how old I grow
You still fucking with the best

Stone cold
Don't ever forget
No matter how old I grow
You still fucking with a big dog

You never met anyone like me
I fucking promise
Rock solid

Heavy lies the crown like the weight of the world
Ice cold under pressure
Throw me up on a cross

All that I do
It hangs above you
Endlessly crashing down
To defy and deny you

Stone cold
Don't ever forget
No matter how old I grow
You still fucking with the best

I am the anti hero
I am
I am

And I'll amplify the agony
In your brain
Forever

Fake fuck
Wanna be
Remember when you bowed down to me
Spineless bitch
Get back in line
You're just another imitation
