I'm on my own in the corner
With these people, I don't know somehow
It's like a heavy situation
I can't drink, my way out of it

Now these ice ain't breaking
So it's melting in my drink
Where the taste is falling
Like your insincerity

Lately, I just feel so tired
Not because of my sleep
I don't like nobody and
Nobody likes me

I'm tired, of the peacock speech
I don't like nobody and
Nobody likes me

I'm tired, not because of my sleep
I don't think I'm ready
For the cliché speech

I'm tired, but I can't explain

Now people walk
In and out, anytime as if I'm a door
It's like we're making, all these strangers
Out of friends and maybe be more

Now these ice ain't breaking
So it's melting in my drink

Lately, I just feel so tired
Not because of my sleep
I don't like nobody and
Nobody likes me

I'm tired, of the peacock speech
I don't like nobody and
Nobody likes me

I'm tired, not because of my sleep
I don't think I'm ready
For the cliché speech
I'm tired, but I can't explain

(Oh, I'm not sleepy)
(Oh, I need some space)
Now these ice ain't breaking
So it's melting in my drink
(Oh, I'm not sleepy)
Where the taste is falling
Like your insincerity

Lately, I just feel so tired
Not because of my sleep
I don't like nobody and
Nobody likes me

I'm tired, of the peacock speech
I don't like nobody and
Nobody likes me

I'm tired, not because of my sleep
I don't think I'm ready
For the cliché speech

I'm tired, but I can't explain
