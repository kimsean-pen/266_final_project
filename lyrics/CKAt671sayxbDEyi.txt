Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullabye
Oh
Somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true
Ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind
Me ee, ee, ee
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top, that's where
You'll find me, ho
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
And the dream that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I?
I, I

Oh, someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind
me ee, ee, ee
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top that's where
You'll find me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dream that you dare to, why, oh why can't I, I?
I, I

Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
