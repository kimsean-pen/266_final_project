Waitress sets the tables
2 and 4 and 6
Laying placemats
Knife, fork, spoon upon napkin
All the counter people
She knows us all by name
A counter people vision
Everywhere we are the same

Oh and once everything starts to shift
Tip the weight that makes this whole thing give
Oh but I don't know where to put my hands
And the thought of silence makes me sick

Hey, I think it might be getting to me
Hey, I think it might be finally getting to me
Hey, I think it might be finally getting to me
Hey, I think it might be finally getting to me

All of the pretty people are out here
The women with their jewels and their long dangling earrings
And the men with one hand on the small of her back
The other casually with his thumb
Through the belt loop of his waistband

And so you line 'em up
A single set and another one gone
Our shotgun days with your name on the line
And so you line 'em up
A single set and another one gone
Our shotgun days with your name on the line only to say

Hey, I think it might be getting to me
Hey, I think it might be finally getting to me
Hey, I think it might be finally getting to me
Hey, I think it might be finally getting to me
