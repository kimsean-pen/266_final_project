You're cold like the blood that runs through your veins
I've been told
There's a black spot next to your name
You can't seem to erase
Shed your skin, change your face

You are the same
You are the same
Shed your skin
Find a better body to fit in

I lost track of all the times you betrayed
I lost faith in the friendships I have made
Drag you down and put you in your place
Shed your skin, change your face

Shed your skin
Find a better body to fit in
Shed your skin
Find a better body to fit in
