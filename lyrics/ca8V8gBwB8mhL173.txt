Far from the light to reach beneath a veil of mist
Countless stories were left to rest in peace
Darkened and calm
The grave uncared
Once a haven filled with hope
The archive of lost dreams
We send our inner fears for the ocean to score
Waiting it takes them all away from the shore
Deepest beliefs from billions of souls
Longing for our wishes to find a way back home
Aah... Naiad
The last one in the unknown
The keeper of our written dreams

Aah... Promises
None of them were left behind
She blessed them with her kiss
See.
Hear and feel
The miracle of life
Believe the signs and trust you'll stay alive
Descend to find the depth of your heart
Mysterious Naiad
Now the circle's closed forever
Aah... Naiad
The archive is gone
We are on our own
