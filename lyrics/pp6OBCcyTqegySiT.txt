Oh honey please, don't shed no tears
As long as im here...

Its far too early in the morning to be trying to call you
And far too early in the daytime to be thinking about that

But I, (but I), but I, (but I), but I am

What did i do in a past life, oh to deserve this
Yeah the way I make myself
He's far too innocent to be a part of such a cruel world
And it is, and it is and it is

And so I'll go, yes I'll go, so I'll take that train and ride.
Hoping I can write her a rhyme, that might stop the tick of time
Get off this situation and feel fine,
Get off this situation and feel fine.

What did i do to deserve her love,
I have to ask myself.
When i am such a bad man but only to her (only to her, only, only to her)

Oh and so I'll go, yes I'll go, so I'll take that train and ride.
Oh and so I'll go, yes I'll go, so I'll take that train and ride.
Wishing, hoping I can write her a rhyme, that might stop the tick of time
Get off this situation and feel fine,
Get off this situation and feel fine.
