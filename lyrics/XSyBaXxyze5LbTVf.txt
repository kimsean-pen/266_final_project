Hmm, bye bye
How do you love someone
That hurts you oh so bad
With intentions good
Was all he ever had

But how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long and I've
Given him all that I could
Maybe love is a hopeless crime
Giving up what seems your lifetime
what went wrong with something once so good?

How do you find the words to say (to say, to say)
To say goodbye? (goodbye)
(Find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say (to say, to say)
To say goodbye (goodbye)
(Find the words to say goodbye)

I know now I was naive
Never knew where this would lead
And I'm not tryin' to take away (Oh no)
From the good man that he is

But how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long and I've
Given him all that I could
Was it something wrong that we did?
Oh, cause others infiltrated
What went wrong with something once so good?

How do you find the words to say
To say, to say (to say goodbye) goodbye
(Find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye
Find the words to say goodbye)

Is this the end? Are you sure?
How should you know
When you've never been here before?
It's so hard to just let go
And this is the one and only love I've ever known, so

How do you find the words to say, to say goodbye
When your heart don't have the heart to say
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye
Find the words to say goodbye

How do you find the words to say
To say goodbye
