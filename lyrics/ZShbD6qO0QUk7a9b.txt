I'd live here if the river would slow down
There must something wrong with this town
they keep dropping out
There must something wrong with this town
the leaves are dropping down

I can love you now, now that you've fallen down
You easily lose your leaves, slow down

I thought I wanted to be up high
until I found that there was far
too much air from my feet to the ground
