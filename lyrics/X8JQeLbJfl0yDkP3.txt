Black Seeds on Virgin Soil

Trapped in a fire that burns in my soul
Like parasites infesting my skin
Screaming for vengeance, and vengeance is mine
With my faith I will prevail
Chained to times of despair
As the end is close and my demons are here
Craving for my inner thoughts
As I die, I'm losing myself
For blood I hunger, possessed by the dark
No remorse, I'll tear your flesh apart
Through my veins the poison runs cold
As you die your faith is left untold
Preachers of life, opposing the dark side
Deceived from the birth
Mission of lies, betrayed from the inside
Seeds of the unfertile earth
Wounds so deep, come heal my soul
Come predict, what has been foretold
