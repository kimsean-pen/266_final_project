I don't know where to begin
Feel a cleaving in my mind
I can't get my act together
Buzz in my head is too loud
I know something's wrong with me
It's starting to burn out my soul
But I feel so weird in here
When you just sit, listen and nod

I've been trying to deny and deceive myself
I've been trying to deny and deceive myself

Sense of insecurity
Restlessness, the turning out
Hatred for my inner chaos
And the color of your couch
I've just had this trouble all my life
Of getting out what is inside

Now I run
But cannot hide

No matter how much I do for them
No matter how much I do for myself
No matter which way I look at it
Fulfilment passes me by

Distracted inner self
On the brink of chaos lost its way
Impatient inner self
On the brink of chaos lost its way

Distracted inner self
On the brink of chaos lost its way
Impatient inner self
On the brink lost its way

Distracted inner self
I'm tuning out
Impatient inner self
I'm spacing out

Distracted inner self
On the brink of chaos lost its way
Cold lie
