Girl, I saw you dancing
I'm looking like trash
Yet you're glancing

I said,? Hello, I'm a rock star?
She said,? I don't care who you are
Just take me with you
And I will blow your mind?

This girl was crazy
Completely out of line
But how she amazed me
Should've seen her grind
I guess she blew my mind

So we've gone past dating
She's spending my cash
And I'm up, waiting

I said,? Baby, why the new car?
She said,? I'm the girlfriend of a star
Just let me handle this
And I will blow your mind?

This girl was crazy
Completely out of line
But how she amazed me
I guess she blew my mind

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Should've seen her grind
I guess she blew my mind

So typically me
Always falling for the easy
And now I can't breathe

So typically me
Always falling for the easy
And when you can't see
She's gonna blow your mind

This girl was crazy
Completely out of line
But how she amazed me
Should've seen her grind
I guess she blew my mind

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Completely out of line
I guess she blew my mind
