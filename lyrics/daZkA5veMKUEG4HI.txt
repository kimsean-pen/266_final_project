I could write my name by the age of three
And I don't need anyone to cut my meat for me
I'm a big girl now, see my big girl shoes
It'll take more than just a breeze to make me

Fall over, fall over, fall overboard, overboard
Fall overboard just so you, you can catch me

But as strong as I seem to think I am
My distressing damsel, she comes out at night
When the moon's filled up and your eyes are bright
Then I think I simply ought to

Fall over, fall over, fall overboard, overboard
Fall overboard just so you, you can catch me
You can catch me

And I watch the ships go sailing by
If I play the girl, will you play the guy?
And I never thought I'd be the type
To fall, to fall, to fall, to fall, to fall

To fall over, fall over, fall overboard, overboard
Fall overboard just so you, you can catch me
You, you can catch me, you, you can catch

I watch the ships go sailing by
If I be your girl, will you be my guy?
And I never thought I'd be the type
To fall, to fall, to fall, to fall, to fall

To fall, to fall, to fall, to fall, to fall
To fall over, to fall over, to fall over, to fall
To fall over, to fall over, to fall over, to fall
To fall over, to fall over, to fall over, fall overboard
Fall overboard just so you, you can catch me
You can catch me, you, you can catch me
