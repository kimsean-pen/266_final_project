I am growing old, I'm drunk in your home
Gather your fears because I'm done
I am growing old, too drunk in your home
There is no complex to complexity
So you won't hear a peep out of me
I am growing old, too drunk in your home
To latch myself sealed shut
Day by day and drop by drop

Day by day and drop by drop
Day by day and drop by drop
