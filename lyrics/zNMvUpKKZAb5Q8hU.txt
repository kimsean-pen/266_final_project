I remember cold dark nights
Staring at a moonlit sky
Walking circles in the same place
Trying to ease my cold dark mind
Questions have been endless here
Not an answer for miles
Out of the horizon line
An exposition of light
I've been terrified for all of my life
Been losing the fight

I'm terrified
I was falling apart til you made it right
I wasted my days in the lowlife
Til you turned all my dark into daylight
I was terrified

After all of this time
You lifted me up from the lowlife
I can see you standing there
Oh if I could just reach out
You know that I've been so afraid
Afraid that I would pull you down
I ruin everything that's perfect
I'm hiding the best of me
You're all I need
To me you are perfect
You bring out the best in me
I've been terrified for all of my life
Been losing the fight

I'm terrified
I was falling apart til you made it right
I wasted my days in the lowlife
Til you turned all my dark into daylight
Oh I was terrified
After all of this time
You lifted me up from the lowlife

Lost without you
Lost without you
Lost without you
Lost without you
Lost without you

I was terrified for all of my life
Been losing the fight
I'm terrified
I was falling apart til you made it right
I wasted my days in the lowlife
Til you turned all my dark into daylight
Oh I was terrified
After all of this time
You lifted me up from the lowlife
