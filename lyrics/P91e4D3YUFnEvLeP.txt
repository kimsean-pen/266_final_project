There are no more races to be run
there are no numbers left to be won
everybody's down
we pulled each other down
there never was a truth to be found
we are all bigots so full of hatred
we release our poisons
there are no more cultures left to slide
there are no more people to be tried
we're in our minds
five billion pieces so defined
read it in a book, it was underlined
we are all bigots so full of hatred
we release our poisons like styrofoam
