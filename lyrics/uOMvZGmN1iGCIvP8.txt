Are you settling?
The faces, the shadows
Are fading away
Wasting it all
Wasting it all
Without any direction

And I can't settle down
Without losing something else
Who let
We're exiled in a foreign land
Who let
Nothing is ever done

Dare I place it all inside of something I can't reach?
When I know that I can make it on my own
We could never know

Is it close enough?
Tracing the outline that's fading away
Wasting in all
Wasting in all
Without any direction
And I need something more
Could you make it feel the same?
Who let
We existed in a different place
Who let
Nothing is ever done

Dare I place it all inside of something I can't reach?
When I know that I can make it on my own
We could never know

We were wrong, all the oppositions gone
Made it past all the conflicts of our past
I can't settle down without using someone else

I've been counting the seconds
After the handshake
Under the stairwell
Inside your bedroom you made a promise
I looked away
I'll never forget that

You can't create a portrait
Out of a shadow, out of an idea
You never had
You never wanted
You never could
I'll never forget that
