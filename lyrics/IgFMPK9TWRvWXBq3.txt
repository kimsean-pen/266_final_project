One,two,three,four, tell me that you love me more
Sleepless long nights
That is what my youth was for

Old teenage hopes
Are alive at your door
Left you with nothing
But they want some more

Oh, you're changing your heart
Oh, you know who you are
Sweetheart, bitter heart
Now I can tell you apart
Cozy and cold
Put the horse before the cart

Those teenage hopes
Who have tears in their eyes
Too scared to own up to one little lie
Oh, you're changing your heart
Oh, you know who you are

One, two three four five, six nine or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
One, two three four five, six nine or ten

Money can't buy you back the love that you had then

Oh, you're changing your heart
Oh, you know who you are
Oh, you're changing your heart
Oh, you know who you are

Who you are, are, are
Oh, you're changing your heart
Oh, you know who you are
Oh, you're changing your heart
Oh, you know who you are
Before the teenage boys
They're breaking your heart
Before the teenage boys
They're breaking your heart
