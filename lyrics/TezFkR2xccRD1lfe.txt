Always lookin' out behind my fences
Always felt isolated, oh-oh-oh
I don't know why I was so defensive
I'll find a way to let you in

I will die if I don't try
Damned if I smile
This is somethin' real
This is somethin' right
Never been in love
Never felt it hard until now

As I lay here in your bed
I need you on my chest
You want me all the time
To take away your breath
It's written on your lips
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

In this ordinary world
Where nothin' is enough
Everything is grey
Mistaking love for lust
When I hold you in my arms
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

I see all your flaws and your imperfections
But that's what makes me love you more, oh-oh-oh
We got such a spiritual connection
Don't you know you're fuckin' beautiful

I will die if I don't try
Damned if I ask why
This is somethin' real
This is somethin' right
Never been in love
Never felt it hard until now

As I lay here in your bed
I need you on my chest
You want me all the time
To take away your breath
It's written on your lips
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

In this ordinary world
Where nothin' is enough
Everything is grey
Mistaking love for lust
When I hold you in my arms
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

I wanna feel your love
Just give me all your trust
Common ain't us
'Cause common ain't enough

In this ordinary world
Where nothin' is enough
Everything is grey
Mistaking love for lust
When I hold you in my arms
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
