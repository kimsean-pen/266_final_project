Take me
Raise me above
Take me
This undying love

What once was, I wish to no longer see
Wings of hatred, come set me free

You are the air in which I breathe
You are the blood I drink and bleed
These words beyond forever true
My new religion is you

Forsake me
It is you that I serve
Take me
This undying love

You are the air in which I breathe
You are the blood I drink and bleed
These words beyond forever true
My new religion is you

New religion
New religion
New religion
New religion

New religion
New religion
New religion
