You can take anything you want
But just don't mess me up
No, no, don't break my bones
I see the way you're lookin'
Starin' at me like I'm something
Some kind of...
Some kind of!
Some kind of girl who follows boys around the world
Some kind of lost and confused little...
Can't help myself, no

I am aware of all the games that you play
But let me tell you, boy
It gets you nowhere!

And I said we're over, we're over
Cuz I can do this by myself
I'm gonna go it alone
Whoa-oh
Oh
And I said, I said
Whoa-oh
Whoa

You better learn to take it easy, my friend
Cuz I'm out of my mind and you're fallin' behind
Hate the way you're always logical
It makes me wanna just say it
Well, just say it
Some kind of boy who wants to dance with all the girls
Some kind of hard to amuse little...
Can't help myself, no!

I'm in the mood
Ready to go break some hearts
But let me tell you, boy
It gets me nowhere!

And I said we're over, we're over
Cuz I can do this by myself
I'm gonna go it alone
Whoa-oh
Oh
And I said, I said
Whoa-oh
Whoa oh

You try to hide it
Try to fake it, make it like you're somethin'
Some kind of...
Some kind of!
Some kind of boy who doesn't care what people think
It's always you against the world

How's that workin' out for you?

And I said we're over, we're over
Cuz I can do this by myself
I'm gonna go it alone
Whoa-oh
Oh
And I said, I said
Whoa-oh
Whoa oh

Slow down
Oh...
