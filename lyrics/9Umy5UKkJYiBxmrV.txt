waiting for the stars to align
there is a restless raincloud in my mind
heavy eyes fixed in the middle of the room
and you're looking for the point to all that you do

i feel guilty being alive
when so many beautiful people have died
i never thought that we wouldn't rule the world
i always think we will i keep my fist clenched still

oh i'm coming
oh i'm coming
when you see me you should run and hide
oh i'm coming
oh i'm coming
it's unfortunate you only look good on the outside

i know the stars will align
if not tonight then some other time
sleeping off the shade in the back of a car
i tried to get away but the car wouldn't start

i may never get it right
my chemicals may balance in some other light
i never thought that we wouldn't rule the world
i always think we will i keep my teeth clenched still

oh i'm coming
oh i'm coming
when you see me you should run and hide
oh i'm coming
oh i'm coming
it's unfortunate you only look good on the outside

you look so good on the outside
i feel so good on the outside
