Smokey Joe you're calling at the station
If I kill him there are complications
I did not ask for this
"Oh but, love, yes, you did"

Maybe it terrifies me
This quiet siege
Maybe it terrifies me

It's too easy
It's too easy
To wish you harm
It's too easy
You through black ice
At the bottom of the river

Smokey Joe hey what's a revelation
"That one's past is not a destination
It is a road for fools
who need empty approvals"

My dark twin
The annihilating Feminine
Does not need
Civilising

Maybe it terrifies me
This quiet siege
Maybe it terrifies me

It's too easy
It's too easy
To wish you harm
It's too easy
You through black ice
At the bottom of the river

Smokey Joe can you pass the pipe
"You have been blessed now go be wise
It is a coward who will say he's not afraid
Of dying when clearly he is potently alive"

A songless robin she became
He stole my sister Clitorides
These silken rubber gloves
Choking his vitriolic tongue

Maybe it terrifies me
This quiet siege
Maybe it terrifies me
This quiet siege

It's too easy
It's too easy
To wish you harm
It's too easy
You through black ice
At the bottom of the river

Smokey Joe is calling at the station
