Hate for hate and ruth for ruth
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth
Scorn for scorn and smite for smite
Love for love and guile for guile

He who is without sin
He who mantles passion with fear
He who turns the other cheek
He who drowns wrath with fire

War for war and woe for woe
Blood for blood and blow for blow
Scorn for scorn and smite for smite
Love for love and guile for guile

He who to evil resist
He who creates wraith from clay
He who declaims never to judge
He who divides seas and skies
He who reveals love as an arm
He who creates shields by fire
He who serves slaves and faints
He who builds walls with tears

(CHORUS)
Fire and tears enlighten my world
This world dressed in fear
Awe the emotions of wrath
Behold the serpent's fear

He who to evil resist
He who creates wraith from clay
He who declaims never to judge
He who divides seas and skies
He who reveals love as an arm
He who creates shields by fire
He who serves slaves and faints
He who builds walls with tears

(CHORUS)

Hate for hate and ruth for ruth
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth
Scorn for scorn and smite for smite
Love for love and guile for guile
War for war and woe for woe
Blood for blood and blow for blow
Scorn for scorn and smite for smite
Love for love and guile for guile
