May I take you higher
Feed well your desire
We won't be forgotten
Foes left slain and rotten

I will have my way as once before
Others stand in awe can't scorn at all

I can, I can, I can make it all again
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna get drowned
I can, I can, I can heed the call again
Fulfill my dreams until I'm cured
I can...

Will I be the flyer keep you more inspired
Some will leave here shattered
Wish us tarred and feathered

Show me anyone who doubts our way
I will laugh out loud and I will say

I can, I can, I can make it all again
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna go down
I can, I can, I can make the call again
Can attain everything to leave you sure
I can...

I can... I, I, I, I

I can

Leave me waiting years or strike today
Trample down the walls and pave your way
I can, I can, I can make it all again
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna go down
I can, I can, I can make the call again
Fulfill my dreams until I'm cured
I can...
I can... I, I, I, I
I can
