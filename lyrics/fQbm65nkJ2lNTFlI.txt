Even though I can see it in your face, I can't really explain
Just how broken and empty and disgraced you seem to be

You cut me out and dragged me down,
Pulled me all the way to the bottom
I've done for you, till black and blue,
What no one else would do for the fallen

One day when nothing ever feels the same,
Just like every other time before,
You hit the walls and lost it all
I'll find a way to wake you from this bed you've made
Even though I know you want me to,
I'm never giving up on you!
(On you, on you)
I'm never giving up, never giving up on you!
(On you, on you)
I'm never giving up, never giving up on you!

You'll never know just how hard it is for me to see you this way

It tears me up, drags me down,
Trying to pull you up from the bottom
I break for you, like I always do
I'll see you through, when you're on your knees and crawling. (Crawling!)

One day when nothing ever feels the same,
Just like every other time before,
You hit the walls and lost it all
I'll find a way to wake you from this bed you've made
Even though I know you want me to,
I'm never giving up on you!
(On you, on you)
I'm never giving up, never giving up on you!
(On you, on you)
I'm never giving up, never giving up on you!
So don't give up on me!
Yeah! Don't you give up on me! (Give up on me)
Yeah! Don't you give up on me!
Yeah! Don't you give up on me!

One day when nothing ever feels the same,
Just like every other time before
You hit the walls and lost it all
I'll find a way to wake you from this bed you've made
Even though I know you want me to,
I'm never giving up on you!
(On you, on you)
I'm never giving up, never giving up on you!
(On you, on you)
I'm never giving up, never giving up on you!
So don't give up on me!
