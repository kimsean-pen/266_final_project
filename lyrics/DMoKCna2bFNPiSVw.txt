We stand up tall
Even in the dark
Never forget we are a light house burning (oh)
They can't hold us back
Never forget we are a light house burning (oh)
We will shine on
To bring us back home

(Woah-oh-oh)
(Woah-oh-oh)
(Woah-oh-oh)
(Woah-oh-oh)

Sometimes I think I don't belong,
I need some words, can't find the song.
We all make a choice in life,
I pray that I'm wrong

I can search in the endless sky
For a reason to survive
We all get lost at times,
in our broken minds

We stand up tall
Even in the dark
Never forget we are a light house burning (oh)
They can't hold us back
Never forget we are a light house burning (oh)
We will shine on
To bring us back home

Rise above the veil of fear
Let them see your passion clear
We all have voices
Its time to be heard

Wake Up
Shine On
This life is ours

We stand up tall
Even in the dark
Never forget we are a light house burning (oh)
They can't hold us back
Never forget we are a light house burning (oh)
We will shine on
To bring us back home

To bring us back home
To bring us back home
(bring us back home)

We will be shinning on
We will be shinning on

We stand up tall
Even in the dark
Never forget we are a light house burning (oh)
They can't hold us back
Never forget we are a light house burning (oh)
We will shine on (We will shine on)
(We will shine on)
To bring us back home

(Woah-oh-oh)
(Woah-oh-oh)
(Woah-oh-oh)
(Woah-oh-oh)

To bring us back home
To bring us back home
(bring us back home)
