Your dreams, they're on my back
Your dreams are in my head
Your hands are on my skin
I know where we're going
I know where we're going

I will try to let you go
If we get in too deep
And I will do my best to go
If we get in too deep
But right now I'm gonna let this slide
You'll be mine, mine, mine
You'll be mine
And I will try to let you go
If we get in too deep

Sometimes I'm falling down
From heaven to the ground
I know we'll get another round
You know what we're doing
You know what we're doing, babe

I will try to let you go
If we get in too deep
And I will do my best to go
If we get in too deep
But right now I'm gonna let this slide
You'll be mine, mine, mine
You'll be mine
And I will try to let you go
If we get in too deep

And I will try to let you go
If we get in too deep

I will try to let you go
If we get in too deep
And I will do my best to go
If we get in too deep
But right now I'm gonna let this slide
You'll be mine, mine, mine
You'll be mine
And I will try to let you go
If we get in too deep
