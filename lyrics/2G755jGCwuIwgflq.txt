Do you remember when we didn't care?
We were just two kids that took the moment when it was there
Do you remember you at all?
Another heart calls

Yeah, I remember when we stole the night
We'd lie awake but dream until the sun would wash the sky

Just as soon as I see you
But didn't I, but didn't I tell you?
As deep as I need you
You wanna leave it all?

What can I do?
Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you

Talk to me
I'm throwing myself in front of you
This could be the last mistake that I would ever wanna do
Yeah, all I ever do is give
It's time you see my point of view

Just then, soon as I see you
But didn't I, but didn't I tell you?
As deep as I need you
You wanna leave it all?

What can I do?
Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you

But I know that you want to figure it out
And God knows I do too
What can I do?
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you

(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(La, la, la, la, la)

(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(La, la, la, la, la)

I'm sorry
So what?
But you don't think I've said enough
I'm sorry
I don't care
You were never there

Just then, soon as I see you
But didn't I, but didn't I tell you?
As deep as I need you
You wanna leave it all?

What can I do?
Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you

I know that you want to figure it out
And God knows I do too
Yeah, what can I do?
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you

(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'll never ask for anyone but you

(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'll never ask for anyone but you

(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'll never ask for anyone but you

(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'll never ask for anyone but you

(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'll never ask for anyone but you
