The sun's original
The way it flicker
It's how I want it to end
Before we disappear
We're poured like lacker
And waves come make us descend

Hearing the grass growing
Tasting the wind blowing
Feeling the sun's burning
(?) the night's coming
Fearing the distant drumming
Wandering who's humming
Raving indeed loving

I still remember the first time that you kissed me
I still remember our times
I still dream of your hand (?) reach out and touch me
The heavy breathing form our (?)
I feel like guarding you
But your hair is longer
The wind is blowing in your hair
I see you in the soft sunlight of September
And thank the Lord in my prayer

Hearing the grass growing
Tasting the wind blowing
Feeling the sun's burning
Knowing the night's coming
(?) waves crashing
Feaing the distant drumming
Wandering who's humming
Loving with shortcomings
Raving indeed loving

The sun's original
The way it flooded
I've never seen it before
Before I disappear
We mealt like butter
And waves come wash us offshore
