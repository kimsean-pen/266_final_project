White white noise

When you wanna dance (White noise)
You dance to the white noise
White white white white
White noise

If you wanna get rich (White noise)
Get hip to the white noise
And if you get rich quick and hip hip
You can be rich rich

Are you mad mad mad mad
(You ain't mad enough)
Are you mad mad mad mad
(You ain't mad enough, ain't mad enough)
Are you sad sad sad sad
(You ain't sad enough)
Are you sad sad sad sad
(You ain't sad enough, ain't sad enough)

(Now shake the format)
(Now push the beat back)

I wanna make a parade (White noise)
Parade up to white noise
Parade white (White white white white) up to the mirror
Come face to face (White white noise)

I feel so sensitive and (White white)
My position might have to be shifted by a break
And I'm counting up all of these benefits
It's nothing but white noise

Are you mad mad mad mad
(You ain't mad enough)
Are you mad mad mad mad
(You ain't mad enough, ain't mad enough)
Are you sad sad sad sad
(You ain't sad enough)
Are you sad sad sad sad
(You ain't sad enough, ain't sad enough)

(Now shake the format)
(Now push the beat back)

Now push, push
White white white white
White white noise

We keep breaking up the white noise (White white noise)
Breaking, the white noise (White white noise)
Breaking breaking up the white noise (White noise)
Breaking, the white noise
