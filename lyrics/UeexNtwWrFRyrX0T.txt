Walking up pirst in the sun, avoiding everyone
When you come I interview over their view
Those pricks begin to hum

Glass vibrates with a tube
You're nothing but a?
United Nations go and fly
Europe all night
And this is no one's fault

Setting one way free
This Canyon's killing me
Well, you dive and lift away
On a dying day, falling from my faith.

Hello hawk
Come pick me up

When I saw your shadow
Where it were once
In a hit somehow I knew
It was you beating down the dust

Grab a spider neck
I volunteer as pray
We could lift he world in gold
If this muddy world
Would only wash away

Hello hawk
Come pick me up
