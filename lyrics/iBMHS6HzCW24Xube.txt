Your story sad to tell
A teenage ne'er do well
Most mixed up non-delinquent on the block

Your future's so unclear now
What's left of your career now?
Can't even get a trade in on your smile
La la la la la la
Beauty school dropout
No graduation day for you
Beauty school dropout
Missed your midterms and flunked shampoo
Well at least you could have taken time, to wash and clean your clothes up
After spending all that dough to have the doctor fic your nose up
Baby get moving (better get moving)

Why keep your feeble hopes alive?
What are proving? (what are you proving?)
You've got the dream but not the drive
If you go for your diploma, you could join a steno pool
Turn in your teasin' comb and go back to high school!
La la la la la la la la la

Hanging around the corner store

Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout)
It's about time you knew the score
Well they couldn't teach you anything
You think you're such a ooker
But no customer would go to you unless she was a hooker!
Baby don't sweat it (don't sweat it)

You're not cut out to hold a job
Better forget it (forget it)
Who wants their hair done by a slob?
Now your bangs are curled, your lashes whirled, but still the world is cruel

Wipe off that angel face and go back to high school
Baby don't blow it
Don't put my good advice to shame
Baby you know it
Even dear Abby'd say the same
Now I've called the shot, get off the pot, I really got to fly
Gotta be going to that, malt shop, in the sky
Beauty school dropout (beauty school dropout)
Go back to high school
