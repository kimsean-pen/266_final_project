Mother the day has come
Someone is trying to take my life away
And you've got to know
That now I'm feeling worst
It seems to dream

I'm still standing here in front
Of your soul
Looking into your fireless eyes
Right now I'm one too many
It's hard to say you may believe it

That everything I'll do for me
Will be in the name of your lonely tear
But stay now
I'll do
I believe in your power
Will you believe in me?

It is something for...
We are living no more

Can't you tell me girl
What I should say and where I'll go tonight?
Maybe in a dream
I'll go between the sun and shining stars

don't worry
I'll be there with you whenever you are
Right now I'm one too many
It's hard to say
You must believe it

That everything I'll do for me
Will be in the name of your lonely tear
But stay now
I'll do
I believe in your power
Will you believe in me?

It is something for...
We are living no more

Deep in you heart so alone
