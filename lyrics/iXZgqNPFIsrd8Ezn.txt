standing round the table
spinning fables
and signing autographs
can't you hear them laugh
ha ha ha ha ha
in their secrecies
they plan their strategies
it's called hypocrisy
and we believe

mornings
they tell me everything
that i need to know
or i care to know
well i can visualize
the look in your eyes
the horror
as the plane goes down
and the siren sounds
we can't believe
we can't believe

in the east where the bear is dancing
in the west where the eagle flies
in the middle we stand our ground
the forces pull us down down down

tensions on both sides
we're paralyzed and victimized
we're terrified and petrified
demoralized and mortified
of genocide and suicide
and patricide and cyanide
we're pacified by every side
force-fed pride and then we die for them
we die for them

in the east where the bear is dancing
in the west where the eagle flies
in the middle we stand our ground
the forces pull us down down down

we believe
