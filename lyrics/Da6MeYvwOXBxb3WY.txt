Elimination
Terminal, what disease
Told me too late
What's this cough and wheeze?
Fatal, you're shittin' me
A second opinion
Is what I need

Laughin' in a windstorm
Blowin' all the cornstalks down
Cryin' in a funeral home
Forward my mail, six feet underground

Elimination
Elimination
Elimination
Elimination

Contagious, say why not
Not just me
Waitin' to rot
Painful
Yeah I know
It couldn't be easy
When I had to go

I'm yankin' on my plug
And I can't seem to get it loose
Pullin' all the stops
Your ideals change, when you got
Nothin' to loose

Elimination
Elimination
Elimination
Elimination

Eliminate the right
Eliminate the wrong
Eliminate the weak
Eliminate the strong
Eliminate your feelings
Eliminate too late
Eliminate the hope
Eliminate, eliminate

If I had just one more day
I'd turn it all around
I'd make a play of good, clean livin'
And dig me out of the ground
And if I had just one more day
I'd say it to your face
Pull the plug on everyone
Eliminate this race

We want the cure
And we want it now
Reissue hope
We don't care how
You're makin' a mess
Diseasin' a nation
Runaway train to elimination

Hopeless there's no doubt
Set on a slow burn
From the inside out
Carefully say what for
Last one out
Closes the coffin door

Spendin' all you saved
And wishin' for a little more
If I'm lookin' at the ceilin'
Then I must be layin' on the floor

Elimination

Elimination

Terminal, what disease
Told me too late
What's that cough and wheeze?
Fatal, you're shittin' me
A second opinion
There's gotta be

Laughin' at the epidemic
Somethin' is goin' around
Cryin' at the epidemic
Pullin' on nails, six feet underground

Eliminate the right

Eliminate the weak

Eliminate your feelings
Eliminate too late
Eliminate the hope
Eliminate, eliminate

Eliminate your feelings
Eliminate too late
