Mockingbird, mockingbird, I copped her a new Beamer
Oh yes she fly away, cicada, but another quaalude
She be back
She be back
Yeah you know that she'll...

Paid a lil' fair on the East side high
Like, "Free Mr. Clark"
Lady upstairs 'bout to be so hot
Smokin' like "fix the car"
New plugs, new wires
Baby, I'm plugged and wired
Been at it since 6 o'clock
Been drinkin' my water
Worried bout mine
Try it, it'll clear up the bumps
I'm up like an attic
I'm fucked, I'm an addict
I'm stuck, it's a habit
Compulsive and damaging
Booches, they all wanna hang like a banister
Bang her and banish her, Crash Bandicoot
Booked like a manual, we did it manual
Prayed to Emmanuel, dipped in detergent
Serpents lurkin', look how they slither
Fuck 'em right now, we on this liquor

Tequila
Mockingbird, you fly, you worth a brand new Beamer
Fly away like a cicada, another quaalude
She'll be back, yeah, she'll be back

Uh, I got my feet up, my feet up
Thick bitch, met her at V-Live, V-Live
I love her because she live, she live
She don't wear no fuckin' FILA, Balenciaga
My deal, sweeter than key lime, gimme the whole pie
With my cousin like Skeeter, breakin' bread from "Anita"
Ooh, I'm 'bout to go and spark some
Up in the car, if you wanna go
Ooh, she got her hands on my torso
She tryna start somethin', ya know
You don't really wanna start none
You don't wanna start none, you gone
Eventually bring out that demon
She screamin' for the Lord, talkin' in tongues
You don't really wanna start none
You don't wanna start none, you gone
Eventually bring out that demon
She screamin' for the Lord, talkin' in tongues

Slow down, won't you?
She the type, pronounce her pronouns
Ask you, "What's your birthday, what's your rising?" Don't know
But the convo's mesmerizing
I beat it like battery
You know them energy girls be the nasty freaks
Pour up a glass of...

Tequila
Mockingbird, you fly, you worth a brand new Beamer
Fly away like a cicada, another quaalude
She'll be back, yeah, she'll be back

It's like, I'm surrounded by dark in the room.
And then I hit the blunt, so I gotta lay down,
but... I wish I was like... on a beach looking at the stars
