Felt the heat of the fire
Caught a cold from the rain
Love just left me standing with nothing but a name
Picked my heart off the ground
As I said to the sky
Never will I let somebody
Ever make me cry

But, just a smile from you
Tore though my defenses
It made no sense
Now, I gotta confide and
Tell the truth
Cause boy I'm left wide open
Hoping you wont leave me broken

You'd think
By now I've seen it all
That my heart
Should be indestructible
But, your touch
Made it impossible
Cause underneath it all
I'm vulnerable

You'd think
By now I've seen it all
That my heart
Should be indestructible
But, your touch
Made it impossible
Cause underneath it all
I'm vulnerable

Thought that I was a fighter
One of love's soul survivors
Strong enough to keep my love from breaking me again
But, you got my attention
Wrote your name on my wall
So I've been laying, praying
That you won't hurt me at all

I've been trying to play it cool
But, I've fallen
And I'm all in
Now, I've got to confide
And tell the truth
Cause your arms are my protection now
Please take care of what you've found

You'd think
By now I've seen it all
That my heart
Should be indestructible
But, your touch
Made it impossible
Cause underneath it all
I'm vulnerable

You'd think
By now I've seen it all
That my heart
Should be indestructible
But, your touch
Made it impossible
Cause underneath it all
I'm vulnerable

I know you're not him
For all that it's worth
And I'm trying to love like
I've never been hurt

But, sometimes I know
That I push you away
Cause underneath I'm still afraid

You'd think
By now I've seen it all
That my heart
Should be indestructible
But, your touch
Made it impossible
Cause underneath it all
I'm vulnerable

You'd think
By now I've seen it all
That my heart
Should be indestructible
But, your touch
Made it impossible
Cause underneath it all
I'm vulnerable

I'm vulnerable

Cause underneath it all
I'm vulnerable
