It's all over
It's all over now
The seal is broken
Creatures spoken now

I hope you come up
To heaven right now
It's all over
It's all over now

Can I be changed?
Or am I the same?

It's all over
It's all over now
No room for hiding
We're children fighting now

I hope you come up
To heaven right now
It's all over
It's all over now

Can I be the same?

The rain is falling
The rain is falling now
Today we're leaving
Our souls are calling now

Stars on his right
Holding seven right now
The rain is falling
The rain is falling now

Can I be changed?
Or am I the same?

It's all over
It's all over now
No room for hiding
We're children fighting now

I hope you come up
To heaven right now
It's all over
It's all over now

Can I be the same?

The same
Can I be changed?
It's all over
It's all over now
No room for hiding
We're children fighting now
I hope you come up
To heaven right now
It's all over
It's all over now
Can I be the same?
Can I be the same?
Same, same
Can I be changed?
