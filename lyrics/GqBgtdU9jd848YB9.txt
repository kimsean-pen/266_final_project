Take me as I am, take me, baby, in stride
Only you can save me tonight
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You let me in, don't leave me out, or leave me dry

Even when I'm alone, I'm not lonely
I hear the sweetest melodies
(Sweetest melodies)
On the fire escapes of the city
Sounds like I am free
(It's got me singing)

God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it
God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it, may you
Stand proud and strong like Lady Liberty, shining all night long
God bless America

Take me as I am, don't see me for what I'm not
Only you can hear me tonight
Keep your light on, babe, I might be standing outside
You let me in, don't leave me out, or leave me dry

Even walking alone, I'm not worried
I feel your arms all around me
(Arms around me)
In the air on the streets of the city
Feels like I am free
(It's got me thinking)

God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it
God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it, may you
Stand proud and strong like Lady Liberty, shining all night long
God bless America

(Sweetest melodies)
Even with you I've got no one to lose
So you'd better believe that nobody can make me feel lonely
Because I hear
(Sweetest melodies)
Even when you talk that talk with the lights on
I still somehow know that I'll never feel, ever feel lonely
I have no fear
(It's got me thinking, yeah)

God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it
God bless America
And all the beautiful people in it, may they
Stand proud and strong like Lady Liberty, shining all night long
God bless America
And all the beautiful people in it
And all the beautiful people in it
