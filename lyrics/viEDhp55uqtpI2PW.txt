Alone I walk, among the twisting shadows
Tempted by the ancient magic, the power of five
My desire to mirror my own image
And I will offer you no soul, offer you no soul

Tonight darkness will shadow the light
Symmetry divine, there's no force greater
Dividing the fathers of time

Feel my hate, I'm banished to this wasteland
My serpents plot the overthrow of your temples and shrines
In the night, my army's rage and fury
Burning my shadow into the land
Vengeance by my hand

Tonight Darkness will shadow the light
Symmetry divine, there's no force greater
Dividing the fathers of time
Tonight darkness will shadow the light
Paradise denied, the balance of ages
Forever lost in time

Was I sure of my fateful wish to evoke
The night from the day?
Thousands now join as one, be afraid
What have I done? Clouds are dimming
The sun with his wrath of disease and decay
This masque of vengeance leads my death parade

What have I done?
My shadow burning
My shadow burns across the land

Tonight darkness will shadow the light
Symmetry divine, there's no force greater
Dividing the fathers of time
Tonight darkness will shadow the light
Paradise denied, the balance of ages
Forever lost in time
