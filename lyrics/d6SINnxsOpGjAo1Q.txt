Ijahman - Are We A Warrior

The earth is alone
And I give thanks for the fullness
Within the firmaments
Is golden days and blossoming nights
His gently hands made I, I man, son of Him
Life was divided and sweet harmony come in
Women and children

Are we a warrior?
Are we a warrior?
Are we a warrior?
Oh Cupid, you stupid.
Let not you arrow from your bow, Lord.

Feet is the mountains, so silent.
And filled fountains of waters,
For all of His loving creatures.
He give us wisdom, and knowledge,
To understand His love.
Do we have to have a war?

Are we a warrior? Lord.
Are we a warrior?
Are we a warrior?
Oh, oh Cupid, it's stupid.
Let not your arrow from your bow.
So hold it low and never let it go.

What cause you have a pistol in your hands, Lord
Is it for to shot a man down dead?
Do we have to have a storm, Lord?
Why can't we be calm like a lamb?
Lord, Lord above, it's not only when
There's a small confusion.
It is a war
There are other ways as well
Sometime being confused
Within your own head
Because at times
Hearts get heavier than lead

Are we a warrior?
Are we a warrior?
Are we a warrior?
Oh Cupid, it's stupid.
Let not you arrow from your bow.
So hold it low and never let go.

Take a look at sad children
And there's often true stories.
It should be one all round glory
The hour has come
And still I can't see no love, it's a war
For food, clothes and shelter, Lord
And crying of mama's and papa's

Are we a warrior?
Are we a warrior?
Are we a warrior?
Oh Cupid, it's stupid.
Let not you arrow from your bow.

(.)

Prophecy is now revealed,
The Son of Man won't take heed.
The hurt he is giving on,
While life is taken in a sudden shock.
The crying of the people,
Multiplying all over.
Jah will give an answer,
To every of our prayer.

Are we a warrior?
Are we a warrior?
Are we a warrior?
Wo oh, oh Cupid, it's stupid.
Let not you arrow from your bow.
And never let it go.

Are we a warrior?
Are we a warrior?
Are we a warrior?
