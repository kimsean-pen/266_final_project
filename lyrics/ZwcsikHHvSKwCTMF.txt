I know there's something here
There's more than meets the eye
More strange, more beautiful
Than these words can describe

I don't know how I got here
The past has come and gone
I just know I have found
The place my heart belongs

And I wanna stay
I feel safe here in your light
This must be what heaven's like
Must be angels in the room
Tonight

So much here in this world
I'll never understand
I'll have to learn to trust
I'll do the best I can
All the mistakes I've made
The wrong turns on this road
Have only led me to your arms and all I know

Cause I wanna stay
I feel safe here in your light
This must be what heaven's like
Must be angels in the room
Tonight

Cause I wanna stay
I feel safe here in your light
This must be what heaven's like
Must be angels in the room
Can you feel it too?
Must be angels in the room
Tonight
