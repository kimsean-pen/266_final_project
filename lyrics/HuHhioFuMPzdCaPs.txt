It's alive!

I will give you life, you'll serve only me
And my will to kill, you will kill for me
All that I desire, all that I command
You are here for me, I'm your master

My creation

I will make for you
A soulmate to love
Unlike your love for me
And you will take my name

She will be your bride
She will serve me too
I will introduce to you
The bride, bride of Frankenstein
