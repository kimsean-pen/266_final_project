The more you win, the more I fail
The taste of blood is in the rain
Sullen sky is turning red
And old carousel is wet

Angels are cutting up my heart
Somewhere above the clouds

The more I live, the more I feel
The smell of incense in the air
Sullen sky is turning red
And your hair is wet

Angels are cutting up my heart
Somewhere above the clouds
On a long flight to the core
To the shore of the soul
To the new life
To discover more
Above the clouds
