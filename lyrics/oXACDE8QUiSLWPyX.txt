Sister, you've been on my mind
Sister, we're two of a kind, so
Sister, I'm keeping my eye on you
I betcha think I don't know nothin' but singing the blues, oh
Sister, have I got news for you;
I'm somethin', I hope you think that you're somthing too
Scufflin', I been on that lonesome road
And I seen a lot of suns goin' down
oh, but trust me no low life's gonna run me around
So let me tell you somethin';
Sister, remember your name, no twister
Gonna steal your stuff away; my sister
We sho' ain't got a whole lot of time,
So shake your shimmy sister,
'Cus honey, Miss Molly is feelin' fine!
