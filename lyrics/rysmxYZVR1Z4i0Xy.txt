Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Say, say what you want
Just don't say that you're leaving
I hope this summer breeze
Will last more than a season
Will you write to me? In time, we'll see
Maybe spend your whole life with me
We've packed our suitcases
We've shut up all the windows
Hold tight, soon you and
I flow anywhere the wind blows
So make life to me, hold tight to me
Stay awake the whole night with me

Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Can I take your shirt to dry my tears?
Can I meet you here this time next year?
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
We could take a chance and disappear
We could runaway, get out of here
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Wish you were here

I taste salt in the air and
In your sweater that I sleep in
I dream of us riding bikes
At sunset by the oceans
Those were giddy days, lazy days
Sipping rosé, time to waste
(Sipping rosé, time to waste)

Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Can I take your shirt to dry my tears?
Can I meet you here this time next year?
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
We could take a chance and disappear
We could runaway, get out of here
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Wish you were here

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Souve-souvenir
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

And if I leave here, you're comin' with me
If you leave here, I'm goin' with you

Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Can I take your shirt to dry my tears?
Can I meet you here this time next year?
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
We could take a chance and disappear
We could runaway, get out of here
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Wish you were here
