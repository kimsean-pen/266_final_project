We're lost, fallen in the water
We'll try to make it to tomorrow
These lies
They got us in a bad flow
Our skin is shaking from the cold

Lies
We're stuck in these currents
Hear our cries
We can't swim in these currents

We're gone
Drifting on a black wave
We'll try
To make it back some day

Lies
We're stuck in these currents
Hear our cries
We can't swim in these currents

Won't go down and say
It's because we cannot swim

Lies
We're stuck in these currents

Lies
We're stuck in these currents
Hear our cries
We can't swim in these currents

Won't go down and say
It's because we cannot swim
Lies
