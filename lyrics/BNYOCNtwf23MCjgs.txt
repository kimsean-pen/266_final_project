The boom time it is over
A ghost town is all that's here
The gold rush it is over
And depression days draw near

So, tonight after sundown
I'm gonna pack my case
Without a word, without a sound
Disappear without a trace

Ohh oh, I'm going southbound
Ohh oh, I'm going southbound

Driftin' like a drover
Chasin' my career
From the ships docked in the harbor
New horizons will appear

Tumbling with the tumbleweed
Down the open road
I'll be taking just what I need
Before my head explodes

Ohh oh, I'm going southbound
Ohh oh, I'm going southbound
Southbound

Ohh oh, I'm going southbound
Ohh oh, I'm going southbound

Hey, you're not getting any younger
The wild west has already been won
Northern nights are growin' colder
And the old eastern ways are gone

So, tonight after sundown
I'm gonna pack my case
Without a word, without a sound
Disappear without a trace

Ohh oh, I'm going southbound
Ohh oh, I'm going southbound

New horizons will appear
Oh, I go to south from here
Without a word, without a sound
I'll get to leave this ghost town

Woh ohh oh, let's to go down to the old
I got to go, oh you know
I'm southbound, southbound
