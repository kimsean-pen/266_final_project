Is it so strange
Is it so strange to to walk back home
I wouldn't listen for, what it's worth
Watching my time wrinkle alone
Bringing me back now, paranoia
Giving me something to give up
Moving along now
It's made me dizzy
Watching the clouds as i go home

Nausea
You've kept youself away from everyone you used know
Nausea
You brought yourself here now everybody's gonna know

Is it so strange
Is it so strange to be alone
I wouldn't listen for what it's worth
Watching the sky as it unfolds
Bringing me back now, paranoia
Giving me something to give up
Moving along now, it's made me dizzy
Watching the clouds as i go home

Nausea
You've kept youself away from everyone you used to know
Nausea
You brought yourself here now everybody's gonna know
