He takes me everywhere
He goes and he goes everywhere
He likes to try on all my clothes
But not my underwear
And he never hates me
Just wants to levitate me
Now I know the secret of the world
I am the girl
And he is the guy
I never dared to be simple and wise
Surprise surprise
He opened up my eyes
I understand everything
And now I can die
He gives me everything
He's got and he's got everything
He calls me on the phone a lot
He's got a special ring
Yeah he really loves me
Sweethearts and turtledoves me
Now I know the meaning of that word
I am the girl
And he is the guy
I never dared to be simple and wise
Surprise surprise
He opened up my eyes
I understand everything
And now I can die
I'm not trying to say
That I don't want to live
'cause I do
I've got more to take
And I've got some more to give you know I do
But if tomorrow my number should be called
I won't be sad
I won't feel bad at all
Waouh!
Yeah he really loves me
Sweethearts and turtledoves me
Now I know the? of that word
I am the girl
And he is the guy
I never dared to be simple and wise
Surprise surprise
He opened up my eyes
I understand everything
And now I can die
Oh he gives me everything
And now I can die
