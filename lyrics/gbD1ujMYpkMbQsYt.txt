Reach out, touch faith!

Your own personal jesus,
Someone to hear your prayers,
Your own personal jesus,
Someone to hear your prayers,
Someone who's there.

Feeling unknown
And your all alone,
Flesh and bone by the telephone,
Pick up receiver, I'll make you a belever.

Take second best,
Put me to the test,
Things on your chest,
You need to confess,
I will deliver,
You know i'm a forgiver.

Reach out, touch faith!
Reach out, touch faith!

Your own personal jesus,
