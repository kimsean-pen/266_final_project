I'm slippin' away
In every way
I can't stay awake
(Understand)
I'm slippin' away
(And I don't know why?)

But tryin' to make it through each day
I'm fallin' apart now in every way
I'm findin' it harder to get by
There's a hole in my heart
And I don't know why?
Now I've come to realize

I'm slippin' away
