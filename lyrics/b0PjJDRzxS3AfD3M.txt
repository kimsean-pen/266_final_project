You can touch, you can touch
You can touch the running water
See my eyes, see my eyes
See my eyes as they wander
See my hair, see my hips
See my breath, feel my kiss
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
Oh no
It will rain, it will rain, it will rain
The sun is warm
It's alive, it's alive, it's alive, it's alive
Is it empty, is it empty, is it empty
Is it at me, is it at me, is it at me
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Burning fire in the mist
Birds of god in the sea
Can you touch the dying sun
You and I are the only one

You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
Oh no
Is it over, is it over, is it over, is it over
Just say yes, just say yes, just say yes
Am I your heart, am I your breath
Am I your eyes, am I you
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Burning fire in the mist
Birds of god in the sea
Can you touch the dying sun
You and I are the only one

Run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come
