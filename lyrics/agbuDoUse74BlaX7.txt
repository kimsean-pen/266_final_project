He Can't Love You
HE CAN'T LOVE YOU
Michael Stanley Band
Ev'ry day I feel love growin
What you say about it showin
And who's this guy sayin
That he knows how to mystify
You know they just come and go honey
He wants to hold you
Don't you let him try
He says he needs you
But you better pass him by
Cause he can't love you like I love you
Just let me prove it to you
He can't love you like I love you
So good as usin' you
But he can't love you like I love you
Well come on let the provin begin
Ooh let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in baby
Any way that you want to
Anything that I can show you
Listen to me
You won't be regrettin
And the time we spend
Well we won't be forgettin baby
Cause when I hold you
Gonna show you why
It's like I told you
I'm no ordinary guy
And he can't love you like I love you
Just let me prove it to you
He can't love you like I love you
So good at usin you
But he can't love you like I love you
Well come on let the provin begin
Ooh let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
