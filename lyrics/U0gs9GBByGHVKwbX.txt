Mic check
Can you hear me?
Gotta know if I'm coming in clearly
Static, through the speakers
In a second, your heart will be fearless
It's taken for granted
Right now, you can't stand it
Breakdown, it's a showdown
Got to scream it out loud
'Cause

I'm not fakin'
Girl, I'm just sayin'

Hey you
Hey you
Now we're in for somethin' new
Hey you
Hey you
Now you're feelin' like I do

Come on (Hey)
Shout it (Oh)
Let's leave the past behind us (Yeah)
Come on (Oh)
Shout it out.
Hey you

Not open to suggestions
I'm dreamin' of you and me dancin'
No one's interferin'
Gotta do it ourselves
We don't need 'em
Long as we're together
We won't want nobody else, baby
Tell me if you're ready
'Cause tonight, you will see.

That I'm not fakin'
Girl, I'm just sayin'

Hey you
Hey you
Now we're in for somethin' new
Hey you
Hey you
Now you're feelin' like I do

Come on (Hey)
Shout it (Oh)
Let's leave the past behind us (Yeah)
Come on (Oh)
Shout it out.
Hey you

'Cause you doubted me (Oh)
Then you trusted me (Yeah)
Then I made you see
How to find your release

You know what to say (Oh)
Are you in?
I gotta hear you scream...

Hey you
Hey you
Now we're in for somethin' new
Hey you
Hey you
Now you're feelin' like I do

Come on (Hey)
Shout it (Oh)
Let's leave the past behind us (Yeah)
Come on (Oh)
Shout it out.
Hey you

Hey you
Hey you
Now we're in for somethin' new
Hey you
Hey you
Now you're feelin' like I do
Come on (Hey)
Shout it (Oh)
Let's leave the past behind us (Yeah)
Come on (Oh)
Shout it out.
