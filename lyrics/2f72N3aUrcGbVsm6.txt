Rush of the past
I quietly crash and the tables turn
You're beautiful strange, defiantly brash
Be careful now

Kid you're a cut above
Always just a cut above the rest

If there's something left to be learned
Then my time is running
Why should I waste it all wasted on you?
I shouldn't be trusted to live and let go
When the last of my cities have burned
Then what's left in nothing
Why did I waste it all wasted on you?
I couldn't be trusted to live and let go

Fill in the blanks, pencil on paper
Disposable
Throw away lines
Intentional but unbelievable

Kid you're a cut above
Always just a cut above the rest

If there's something left to be learned
Then my time is running
Why should I waste it all wasted on you?
I shouldn't be trusted to live and let go
When the last of my cities have burned
Then what's left in nothing
Why did I waste it all wasted on you?
I couldn't be trusted to live and let go

Shaken and tried
Fade and resign as the tables turn
Let's slip away the renegade life you've been dreaming of

Kid you're a cut above
Always just a cut above the rest

If there's something left to be learned
Then my time is running
Why should I waste it all wasted on you?
I shouldn't be trusted to live and let go
When the last of my cities have burned
Then what's left in nothing
Why did I waste it all wasted on you?
I shouldn't be trusted to live and let go
