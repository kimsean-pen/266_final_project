Baby, girl, would you come my way?
Tell me all the things
That you wanna say

Baby, girl, you can say my name?
Show me all the ways
You can move that thing

I don't wanna take nowhere
I don't wanna waste your time
Baby, girl, would you come my way?
Baby, girl, would come for me?

Baila, conmigo
Anoche, contigo

I wanna feel you against me
All night, bodies connecting

Baby, girl, yeah
We can get it in
I can be temptation
You can be my sin

I want the rush of your heartbeat
Those eyes, I know that you want me

Baby, girl, would you come my way?
Tell me all the things
That you wanna say

Baby, girl, you can say my name?
Show me all the ways
You can move that thing

I don't wanna take nowhere
I don't wanna waste your time
Baby, girl, would you come my way
Baby, girl, would come for me

Vamos, fiesta
I want you, se√±orita
I'm gonna kiss all your body
Sharp breath, gripping the bed sheet

Baby, girl, yeah, I'mma put it in
I can make your bed shake
I can be your sin
Your hands scratching against me
One look, I know that you want me
