I've been having dreams and visions
in them you are always standing
right beside me
i reach out for your hand
to see your arms extending
outstretched towards me
For you i don the veil
by your light
others pale by comparison
i place my faith in love
my fate in this communication
I've been having dreams and visions
in them you are always standing
right beside me
i reach out for your hand
to see your arms extending
outstretched towards me
To you i give my pledge
i honor all that's good
in this life we're living
to think not only of myself
but of the greater union
Can i get a witness
there is salvation and rapture for the lonely
can i get a witness
bless this day sacred and holy
sacred and holy
I've been having dreams and visions
in them you are always standing
right beside me
i reach out for your hand
to see your arms extending
outstretched towards me
With you i am revealed
all my shame all my faults and virtues
behold body mind and spirit
heart and soul devoted all to you
Can i get a witness
bless this day sacred and holy
sacred and holy
