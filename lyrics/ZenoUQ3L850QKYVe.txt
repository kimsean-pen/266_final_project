On my back, breathing heavy, staring at the light
Praying this ain't the end, but pretty sure it might be
On my back, got my heart beating out of my chest
I never thought, can't believe that I'd go out like this
Go out like this

So these are the walls that have to hold this moment
I never expected to be here again
My vision is blurring as the light starts to fade
Please, pull me out from this

My ribs are breaking, I swear, I'm only 23
Crawling, searching for a lifeline I just can't reach
Somebody, hear me; someone, open up the door
Get me up off of this floor and stop the shaking, the shaking
The blood is boiling in my veins, oh God, the pain, it's unrelenting
I'm ready for the end if it means that all of this will end

So these are the walls that have to hold this moment
I never expected to be here again
My vision is blurring as the light starts to fade
Please, pull me out from this

Through the haze, I saw a face
A second chance, another life to live
How did you forgive me?
Held my head against your chest
Told me everything's alright, don't be afraid
Close your eyes and rest
Through the haze, I saw a face
A second chance, another life to live
How did you forgive me?
Held my head against your chest
Told me everything's alright, don't be afraid

So these are the walls that have to hold this moment
I never expected to be here again
My vision is blurring as the light starts to fade
Please, pull me out from this

Please, pull me out from this
So these are the walls that have to hold this moment
Please, pull me out from this
