You deleted your evidence
You depleted yourself
Face down wasn't good enough
You had to give me your hell

Not much more inside of me left to lose
No one hates me quite like you
Let me show you the proof

I don't mind my own self-loathing
And I don't need help from you
I know I'm lonely
But what am I supposed to do?

You believe that you're innocent
You're relieving your guilt
The Jury seems to be deadlocked
Look at the drama you built

Seems like everyone's guaranteed damaged truth
What makes someone hate like you?
And is there something to prove?

But I don't mind my own self-loathing
And I don't need help from you
I know I'm lonely
But what am I supposed to do?

Oh, I don't mind my own self-loathing
And I don't need help from you
(I don't mind my own)
I know I'm lonely, but what am I supposed to do
(I don't want to know)
With all my coldest memories of you?
(I won't give my all)
I know I'm angry... and I don't know need help from you
(I don't want to know)
