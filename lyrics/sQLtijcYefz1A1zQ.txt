Something 'bout the way the highway meets my eyes in twos
Tell me everything you know; tell me something new
I wanna drive to El Dorado, straight into the sun
Cause you're strapped around my side; they're rising in your eyes
I hear Bob Marley's playing on the radio
Well, Bob Marley's playing on the radio
I wanna move in close; girl, don't you tell me no
Bob Marley's playing on the radio
Can I choose to feel this way for the rest of my days?
This is a great unknown; open road is my home
With the top down, we'll find the gateway to stars
This is a great unknown; I was a rolling stone
This could be love, oh
Bob Marley's playing on the radio
Well, Bob Marley's playing on the radio
I wanna move in close; girl, don't you tell me no
Bob Marley's playing on the radio
I feel alive cause
Bob Marley's playing on the radio
Well, Bob Marley's playing on the radio
I wanna move in close; girl, don't you tell me no
Bob Marley's playing on the radio
