Midnight bottle take me, come with few of my memories
And everything, well, come back to me
Midnight bottle make it real what feels like make believe
So, I can see a little more clearly
Like every single move you make
Kissing me so carefully
On the corners of my dreaming eyes

I've got a midnight bottle, gonna drink it down
A one way ticket takes me to the times we had before
When everything felt so right
If only for tonight

A midnight bottle, gonna ease my pain
From all these feelings driving me insane
I think of you and every thing's all right
If only for tonight

Got a midnight bottle, drifting off into the candlelight
Where I can find you in your time
A midnight bottle,
I forgot how good it felt to be in a dream
Just like you had me
'Cuz lately, I've been stumbling
Feels like I'm recovering
But I think it's only for tonight

I' ve got a midnight bottle, gonna drink it down
A one way ticket takes me to the times we had before
When everything felt so right
If only for tonight

A midnight bottle, gonna ease my pain
From all these feelings driving me insane
I think of you and every thing's all right
If only for tonight

If only for tonight, oh, if only for tonight
If only for tonight

I've got a midnight bottle, gonna drink it down
A one way ticket takes me to the times we had before
When everything felt so right
If only for tonight

A midnight bottle, gonna ease my pain
From all these feelings driving me insane
I think of you and every thing's all right
If only for tonight, yeah

Midnight bottle, take the time away
From where we are
