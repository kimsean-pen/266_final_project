(My father's sins are out tonight)
(My father's sins are out tonight)

I haven't seen him in years
I haven't seen him in years

(My mother's sins are out tonight)
(My mother's sins are out tonight)

I haven't loved her in years
I haven't loved her in years

But to those for loneliness sometimes it just makes so much sense
(Here's a toast for loneliness sometimes it just makes so much sense)
For every night I drink alone I'm happier than I could have ever known
(Every night I drink alone and I'm happier than I could have ever known)

(My father's sins are out tonight)
(My father's sins are out tonight)

My skin is on the run
My skin is on the run

(My father's sins are out tonight)
(My father's sins are out tonight)

My skin is on the run
My skin is on the run

I'm not waiting
I'm not waiting

But to those for loneliness sometimes it just makes so much sense
(Here's a toast for loneliness sometimes it just makes so much sense)
For every night I drink alone I'm happier than I could have ever known
(Every night I drink alone and I'm happier than I could have ever known)

I'm not waiting
I'm not waiting

I'm betting dreams upon my paper wings (upon my paper wings)
Because flying isn't just for kings (isn't just for kings)
I take the stairs to the very top floor (very top floor)
I paid the super to leave open the door (leave open the door)
A perfect sunset is sinking in the sky (sinking in the sky)
I know my body is ready to fly (is ready to fly)
I start the countdown backwards from ten (backwards at ten)
When I reach one my family name will end (sentiment will end)

Falling down as windows pass I start to cry
And curse the day my parents laid
In a bed of hopelessness where love was made
Please mark my grave "Unknown"

But to those for loneliness sometimes it just makes so much sense
(Here's a toast for loneliness sometimes it just makes so much sense)
For every night I drink alone I'm happier than I could have ever known
(Every night I drink alone and I'm happier than I could have ever known)

Here I lie
Here I lie
