I know places we can go babe
I know places we can go babe
And the high won't fade here babe
No, the high won't hurt here babe
I know places we can go babe
I know places we can go babe
Where the highs won't bring you down babe
No, the highs won't hurt you there babe
Don't ask me when, but ask me why
Don't ask me how, but ask me where
There is a road, there is a way
There is a place, there is a place
I know places we can go babe
Come in home, come on to fold babe
And the high won't fade here babe
No, the high won't hurt then babe
So, come lay
And wait, now won't you lay?
And wait, waiting on me
I know places we can go babe
Come in home, come on to fold babe
I know places we can go babe
Coming home, come unfold babe
