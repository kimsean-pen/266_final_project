Big train rolling down the line
Makes me lonely
Sometimes I wish to ride away
Sometimes I want to ride away
Yeah

Big plane flying through the clouds
Makes me worry
Sometimes I wish to fly away
Sometimes I want to fly away

But you can't judge a book
Looking at the cover
You can't love someone
While messing with another
No, you can't win a war
Fighting with your brother
You wanna have peace
Gotta love one another

Big guns lighting up the sky
Makes me worry
Sometimes I wish to run away
Sometimes I want to run away

But you can't judge a book
Looking at the cover
You can't love someone
While messing with another
No, you can't win a war
Fighting with your brother
You wanna have peace
Gotta love one another

I have seen my brothers
In ashes on the ground
And maybe in a new life
We can turn this thing around

But you can't judge a book
Looking at the cover
You can't love someone
While messing with another
No, you can't win a war
Fighting with your brother
You wanna have peace
Gotta love one another

No you can't judge a book
Gotta love one another
Can't judge a book
No you can't judge a book
