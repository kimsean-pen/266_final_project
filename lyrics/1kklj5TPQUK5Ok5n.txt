(Yes I would babe anyway)
I'd raise you high above me

If I was a miller at a mill wheel grindin'
Now would you miss your color box?

& your soft shoes shining? (& your soft shoes shining)
If I were a carpenter & you were a lady
Girl, would you marry me anyway? (would you marry me anyway)
Want you have my baby? (would you have my baby)
