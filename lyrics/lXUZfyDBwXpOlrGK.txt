And it rained all night and washed the filth away
Down New York airconditioned drains
Oh, the click click clack of the heavy black trains
A million engines in neutral

Oh, the tick tock tick of a ticking timebomb
Fifty feet of concrete underground
One little leak becomes a lake
Says the tiny voice in my earpiece
So I give in to the rhythm
The click click clack
I'm too wasted to fight back
Tick tock goes the pendulum on the old grandfather clock

I, I can see you
But I can never reach you

And it rained all night and then all day
The drops were the size of your hands and face
The worms come out to see what's up
We pull the cars out from the river

It's relentless
Invisible
Indefatigable
Indisputable
Undeniable

So how come it looks so beautiful?
How come the moon falls from the sky?

Can see you
But I can never reach you

I can see you
But I can never reach you
