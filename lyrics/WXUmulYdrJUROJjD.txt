You remember sitting inside the caf√©
Selfishly aware of things You couldn't change
Edith was buried down the same street
'Give your heart & soul to me'

You remember the first time You called
Life arranged by feelings You felt
Standing in the snow
Always gone
The door in the floor
Always closed

You sat down on the patio
watched the cars go by
Heard the splash from Icarus
Falling from the sky
There was something You couldn't move
You couldn't be
Love turned into reasoning
Became so harrowing

People You loved
Places You saw
Portions are gone
