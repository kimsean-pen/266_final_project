Once again here is the sunlight
Picking through my cities grey sky
Not anymore lasting a night time
I'll feel again what is to be alive

The rain slowly stops one day at a time
The clouds are fading away
Every place seems to be more open while
The landscapes stay the same

As every summer, just get's colder
I enjoy it like it's the last
I'm getting better at growing older
The time is passing by so fast

I feel like a leaf for all these priceless times
That take my breath away
Let me forget the cold of the winter nights
And just before today

'Cause every summer, just get's colder
I enjoy it like it's the last
I'm getting better at growing older
The time is passing by so fast, so fast

As every summer, just get's colder
I enjoy it like it's the last
I'm getting better at growing older
The time is passing by so fast
