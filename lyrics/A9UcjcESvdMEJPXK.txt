Break a mirror and ignore
All my features that we are facing
See what I can do without safety
Make my palms bleed, do what's asked of me
With my hand over my heart

Made a pledge to never grow up, a bitter dinosaur
Never make mistakes that I've made before
Never feel entitled
I just want to know I'm contributing

I want to live selfless
Instead of just floating by
Living every day like it's my last life
Can catch up on my sleep when I die
Aren't you sick of being selfish?
I want to show that I tried
Living every day like it's my last life
Can catch up on my sleep when I die

And society is a crippler
Nothing meaner, than bloated eyes
Followed by a smirk and a whisper
It's a messy life but I let it fly
Cause my hand is over my heart

With a pledge to never grow up, a bitter dinosaur
Never make mistakes that I've made before
Never feel entitled
I just want to know I'm contributing

I want to live selfless
Instead of just floating by
Living every day like it's my last life
Can catch up on my sleep when I die
Aren't you sick of being selfish?
I want to show that I tried
Living every day like it's my last life
Can catch up on my sleep when I die

If I'm not making any sense
Then you're not at all
You just haven't yet felt emptiness
Like the taste of a flat soda
You thought it would be so sweet
God all you drank but still feel incomplete
No I'm not gonna settle anymore
No I'm not gonna hold my tongue
If you haven't made enemies
Than you've never stood for anything
You're just dust in the breeze

I'm just dust in the breeze
But I wanna be a hurricane

I want to live selfless
Instead of just floating by
I want to live selfless
Can catch up on my sleep when I die
I want to live selfless
I want to show that I tried
Living every day like it's my last life
Can catch up on my sleep when I die
