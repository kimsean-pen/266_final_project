And it's all in how you mix the two
and it starts just where the light exists
it's a feeling that you cannot miss
and it burns a hole through everyone that feels it
well you're never gonna find it

if you're looking for it won't come your way
well you'll never find it
if you're looking for it
(looking for it)
should've done something but I've done it enough

by the way your hands were shaking
rather waste some time with you
and you never would have thought in the end
how amazing it feels just to live again

it's a feeling that you cannot miss
it burns a hole through everyone that feels it
well you're never gonna find it
if your looking for it won't come your way

well you'll never find it
if you're looking for it
(looking for it)
should've done something but I've done it enough
by the way your hands were shaking

rather waste some time with you
should've said something but I've said it enough
by the way my words were faded
rather waste some time with you

(waste some time with you)
(waste some time with you)
should've done something but I've done it enough
by the way your hands were shaking
rather waste my time with you

should've said something but I've said it enough
by the way my words were faded
rather waste my time with you
should've done something but I've done it enough

by the way my hands were shaking
rather waste some time with you
waste some time with you
waste some time with you
(waste some time with you oohh)
waste some time with you
(waste some time with you)
waste some time with you
(waste some time with you)
(should've done something but I've done it enough
by the way my hands were shaking
rather waste some time with you)
