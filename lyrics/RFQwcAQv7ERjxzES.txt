You're the mouth, I've got nothing to say anymore
It's a shame I know, we're perfectly in loathe
Let's not say, you never give me anything
I don't care, despite of what's right there

And do I really need to tell you
That I've got a twisted twin soul for you?
I've got my palm out reaching for you

You're the eyes, I've got nothing to see anymore
To convince me enough to compromise my heart
Let's not say, it's just a game again
We both know we're perfectly in loathe

And do I really need to tell you
That I've got a twisted twin soul for you?
I've got my palm out reaching for you
