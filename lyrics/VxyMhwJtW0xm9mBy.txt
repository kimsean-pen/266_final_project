Running Under Fire.

She's daddy's little girl
Protected from the world
Got it all in her pocket
Now it's time to unlock it
Another tight jean sixteen
You know what I mean
Getting restless, she's untested
It's time to leave the nest, yeah

She won't take your rejection
She'll just find a new direction

She's running under fire
Whoa-oh-oh
Running under fire
Always wanting more
Running under fire
Whoa-oh-oh, oh, yeah
She's running

If you've got it then she wants it
Taking what she needs
A live wire getting higher
But, baby, watch your speed
You want to push it to the limit
Show them what you've got
You want to be independent
It's everything you're not

She won't take your rejection
She'll just find a new direction

She's running under fire
Whoa-oh-oh
Running under fire
Always wanting more
Running under fire
Whoa-oh-oh
Running under fire
Whoa-oh-oh

She won't take your rejection
She'll just find a new direction

She won't take your rejection
She'll just find a new direction

She's running under fire
Whoa-oh-oh
Running under fire
Always wanting more
Running under fire
Whoa-oh-oh
Running under fire
Whoa-oh-oh

Running under fire
Running under fire
Running under fire
Running under fire
