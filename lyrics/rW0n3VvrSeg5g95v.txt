Bad oats in town
The word went out
So my horse and me, we left town
Rode my Palomino down

To Gil Blanco County
It's not far, you know

Ever seen the sun rise
In Gil Blanco County?
Ever see the pools they got there?
It's where the birds go on the Fourth

Just a bird's way
To celebrate

Got caught in a storm
In Gil Blanco County
"It rained so hard," said Injun Joe
He knows all there is to know

It should wash the face of the Earth
And make us clean again
