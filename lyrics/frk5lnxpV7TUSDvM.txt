One time a thing occurred to me, what's real and what's for sale?
Blew a kiss and tried to take it home
It isn't you, isn't me, search for things, that you can't see

Going blind, out of reach, somewhere in the vasoline
Two times and it has rendered me, punch drunk and without bail
Think I'd be safer all alone
Flies in the vasoline we are, sometimes it blows my mind

Keep gettin' stuck here all the time
It isn't you, it isn't me, search for things, that you can't see
Going blind, out of reach, somewhere in the vasoline

(...)
You'll see the look, and you'll see the lies
You'll eat the lies, and you will

Flies in the vasoline we are, sometimes it blows my mind
Keep gettin' stuck here all the time
It isn't you, it isn't me, search for things, that you can't see
Going blind, out of reach, somewhere in the vasoline
