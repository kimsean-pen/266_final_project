(featuring the Skunks)

I-I-I-I'm an alien from outer space
(outer space)
I'm a cybergirl without a face,
a heart, or a mind.
(A product of metal)
Oa-oh
(A product of metal)
Oo-o-oooh
(I'm a product... of the man.)

See-see-see-see
I'm a slave girl without a race
(without a race)
On the run cause they here to erase
And chase out my kind.
(They've come to destroy me.)
(They've come to destroy me.)

And I
(They've come to destroy me!)
think to myself
(Impossible-ly)
Wait, it's impossible
(they're coming for me)
That they're gunning for me
(and now the police are after you)
And now they're after you
(For loving too)

A-hoh, and all the sirens go
doo-doo
(sirens go doo-doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo)
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
(Doo, doo, doo-ooo, ooo, oo-oo, oo-oo)
Oh baby, oooh you know the rules
(I love you and
I won't take no for an answer)

They say that Violet Stars
will set you free
(set you free)
When you're running, lost and alone
(Follow them down)
Up Neon Valley streets
(up Neon Valley streets)

A-a-a-oh, a pretty day
makes a pretty picture
(A pretty picture)
But fall in love
And they're coming to get ya!
Who knew 10 men
with guns were at the door?
(Who's at the door?)
The Droid Control!
(The Droid Control!)

(Impossible-ly)
Wait, it's impossible
(they're coming for me)
That they're gunning for me
(And now the police are after you)
And now they're after you
(For loving too)

Baby, I hear the sirens go
doo-doo
(Sirens go doo-doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo)
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
(Doo, doo, doo-ooo, ooo, oo-oo, oo-oo)
C'mon baby, 'cos here they come
(You know the rules!)

[whispering]
Sssh! This way! Go this way!
I see 'em, go this way!
Go this way, this way, this way!
Out the window, out the window!
Don't let 'em get out the window!

(Doo-dip, do-dip,
Dip, doo-dip, do-dip)
(Doo-dip, do-dip,
Dip, dip, do-dip doo)

All my cyboys and cybergirls
Get up if you gon' get down
Citizens pull yo pants up
And cyborgs pull yo pants down
'Round yo ankles, and show yo rust
Shake yo tanks you know its a must
I don't know about Cindi Mayweather
Get on up here and just,
Baby just let me just hear you squeak

Man, I love my baby so!
(Impossible-ly, they're coming for me)
I said I love my baby so!
(and now the police are after you)
And he loves me too
(For loving too)
He loves me too, he loves me, too!

(sirens go doo-doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo)
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
(Doo, doo, doo-ooo, ooo, oo-oo, oo-oo)
I said oh!
(You know the rules!)
I said oh!
Oh baby!

(Impossible-ly, they're coming for me)
(And now the police are after you)
(For loving too)
(Sirens go doo-doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo)
(Doo, doo, doo-ooo, ooo, oo-oo, oo-oo)
A-a-a-a-oh!
