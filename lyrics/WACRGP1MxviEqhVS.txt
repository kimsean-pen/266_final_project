Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists with pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you

Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer nights (Summer nights)
Secret moments shared within the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft spoken words
Say it, say it again
I love you always forever

Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
Say it, say it again
I love you always forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

You've got...
The most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
You've got...
Me almost melting away
As we lay there
Under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness
A magical time

Say it, say it again
I love you always forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you (Say it, say it again)
I love you always forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

Say you'll love and love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always everywhere and everything
Say you'll love and love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always everywhere and everything

Say you'll love and love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always everywhere and everything
Say you'll love and love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always everywhere and everything

I love you always forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
