We are going nowhere fast
Are we made of glass?
No one knows, no one knows

Play out at the highest level
Something never sung before
Stalk by, human interaction
Keep them in their corners

We can start and turn off everything
It's all the same, don't say I'll laugh again

Save me
Oh, come on and save me
From this world
Tell me
'Cause I need to know
I'm not alone

We are taught to watch the puppets
Not the hands controlling
Do you think if we pull out the rug
The world would stop revolving?

We can start and turn off everything
It's all the same, don't say I'll laugh again

Save me
Oh, come on and save me
From this world
Save me
Oh, come on and save me
From this world

Tell me
'Cause I need to know
I'm not alone

We are going nowhere fast
Are we made of glass?
No one knows, no one knows

A wise man told me that we are born with wings
But never taught to fly
Doesn't that make you wonder why
Is it to prevent us from falling out of the sky
Or is it to stop us from soaring too high
So let me ask you this
Are you running around in a circle, going nowhere fast?
'Cause when you look at the man in the mirror
He's made of nothing but glass
You're never aware that mountains don't move themselves
Tectonic plates make them shift
That all it took was a staff to part the Red Sea
All it took was a bus to Montgomery
A single woman who refused to give up her seat
We fought an entire army with a bouquet of flowers back in the '70's
But now you're taught to remain without will until you run out of energy
Afraid that if you strive for an ideal you end up like a Kennedy
It's like being on a treadmill every day but never losing any weight
'Cause to see success the food before you digest has to change
We're stressed and high, get depressed and die
But still afraid to question why
One of the biggest criminals I ever met wore a suit and tie
When did we stop believing? When did we stop marching?
When did we stop chanting?
