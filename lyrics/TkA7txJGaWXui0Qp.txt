I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Workin' every day, now you bleedin'
Through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're
Sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited
'Cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

You wanna see your friends
But you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor on your brain and they say it's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and
They'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too
So you better not get physical
Welcome to America, that type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

Wake up in the mornin'
Now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important
Now you feelin' philosophical
When I die I'll pack my bags
Move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible

You think she's adorable
She thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it
But your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical

And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I try suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Runaway, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room

Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
