You know you make me wanna...
You know you make me wanna...

To start it off I know you know me,
To come to think of it, it was only last week
That I had a dream about us, oh
That's why I'm here, I'm this writing this song,
To tell the truth you know I've been hurting all along,
Someway let me know, you want me girl.

Every time you see me what do you see?
I feel like I'm a poor man and you're the queen,
Ouu baby, you're the only thing that I really need,
baby that's why.

You make me wanna call you in the middle of the night,
You make me wanna hold you till the morning light,
You make me wanna love, you make me wanna fall,
You make me wanna surrender my soul.
I know this is a feeling that I just can't fight,
You're the first and last thing on my mind,
You make me wanna love, you make me wanna fall,
You make me wanna surrender my soul.

Well I know that these feelings won't end now,
They'll just get stronger if I see you again,
Baby I'm tired of being friends.
I wanna know if you feel the same,
And could you tell me do you feel my pain?
Don't leave me in doubt.

Everytime you see me what do you see?
I feel like I'm a poor man and you're the queen,
Oh baby, you're the only thing that I really need baby that's why...

You make me wanna call you in the middle of the night,
You make me wanna hold you till the morning light,
You make me wanna love, you make me wanna fall,
You make me wanna surrender my soul.
I know this is a feeling that I just can't fight,
You're the first and last thing on my mind,
You make me wanna love, you make me wanna fall,
You make me wanna surrender my soul.

I'll take you home real quick
Sit you down on the couch,
Pour some Dom Perignon and hit the lights out,
Baby we can make sweet love.
Then we'll take it nice n slow,
I'm gonna touch you like you've never known before,
We're gonna make love ohoewow.

CYou make me wanna call you in the middle of the night,
You make me wanna hold you till the morning light,
You make me wanna love, you make me wanna fall,
You make me wanna surrender my soul.
I know this is a feeling that I just can't fight,
You're the first and last thing on my mind,
You make me wanna love, you make me wanna fall,
You make me wanna surrender my soul.
