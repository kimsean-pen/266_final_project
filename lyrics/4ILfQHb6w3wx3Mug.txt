I was losing all my friends
Was losing them to drinking and to driving
I was losing all my friends, but I got 'em back

I am on the mend
And at least now I can say that I am trying
And I hope you will forget, the things that I still lack
Yeah

Is it in you now
To bear to hear the truth that you have spoken
Twisted up by knaves, to make a trap for fools

Is it in you now
To watch the things you gave your life to, broken
Then stoop and build them up, with worn out tools

Yeah,
Yeah,
Yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah

Nothing gets so bad
A whisper from your father couldn't fix it
He whispers like a bridge, it's a river spanned

Take all that you have
And turn it into something you would miss if
Somebody threw that brick and shattered all your plans

Yeah,
Yeah,
Yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah

Time to get the seeds into the cold ground
It takes a while to grow anything
Before it's coming to an end, yeah

Before you put my body in the cold ground
Take some time and warm it with your hands
Before it's coming to an end again

(Coming to an end, yeah...)

Do you miss the blend
Of colors she left in your black and white field
Do you feel condemned, just being there

I am not your friend
I am just a man who knows how it feels
I am not your friend
I'm not your lover
I'm not your family

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah

Time to get the seeds into the cold ground
It takes a while to grow anything
Before it's coming to an end, yeah
