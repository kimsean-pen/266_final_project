He couldn't pay the bills so he moved his family
In a cheap apartment near a wast refinery
They didn't know their water was infected with the slime
That they dump into the water barrels at a time

A deadly reaction sets forth
A hazardous mutation to end all creation is born
Pitiless fluid corroding like acid
Flesh torn!
Whose skins unprotected will soon be infected
Be warned

Radiation is spreading
Human lives are ending
No one can stop this
Mutated race of the damned
Across infected lands

In a panic he ran screaming
From his wife and kids
The image burned into his mind
Of their corroded limbs
As the smell of rotting flesh
Begins to attract flies
They knew that they could never
Return to their normal lives
