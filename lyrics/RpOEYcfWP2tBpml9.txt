Another panic attack
As I was browsing the stacks
And the books were falling in an avalanche
Though he sensed I was trapped
He was busy with... something

Now I'm checking my phone
But I don't want to talk
Don't wanna lopside my language
No I don't wanna go off

'Cause I lean in when I suffer
Lean in when I suffer

A panic attack
Though my directive's relax
It's beyond my skill set
Covetous of the calm wit
From a tyke uninvolved
All abyss with no clapback

I'm checking my phone
He's unworthy of talk
If he really wants to be the one
He'd forfeit shotgun for once

'Cause I lean in when I suffer
Lean in when I suffer

But I take him back to the county fair
I take him back, though he don't deserve to be there
He drew a bath and floated there
He cares a lot
We're strictly speaking self-care

Lean in when I suffer
Lean in when I suffer again
Lean in when I suffer
Lean in when I suffer again

Lean in when I suffer
Lean in when I suffer

Checking my phone
But I don't want to talk
Don't wanna lopside my language
No I don't wanna go
