write the lines you want me to
with words I dare to use of all

the ones that you have taught me
along the years.

You cast a perfect shadow on the paper
fade away with sunlight.
Fear the way you know me
love can leave a stain.

You steal my only hope
and make me stay awake another night.
I wish you bare with me, stay near me

when the atumn leaves have fallen.
Solitude, my pain, the last thing left of me.
If you fall I'll catch.
If you love I'll love

and so it goes, my dear.
Don't be scared you' ll be safe
this I swear if you only love me

Seven lonely lies written on dead winters night.
Open the only book with the only poem I can read.
In blood I sign my name
and seal the midnight with a tear.

Burn the paper, every line, for them I cried.
If you fall I'll catch
If you love I'll love
and so it goes my dear

don't be scared you? ll be safe
this I swear if you only love me back.
I am the Playwriter and you are my Crown.

Make me cry for your love
like you? ve done many times
so I know I can? t write these storylines without you.
Lady Pain, make me strong
can? t we be together without them forever?
The words I write can only hurt me
sorry for the rain.
Thank you my only one
you gave me this pain.
I leave you gently on the floor
take one step towards the door.
Where's that letter never written
good night now.
If you fall I'll catch
If you love I'll love
and so it goes my dear
don't be scared you? ll be safe
this I swear if you only love me.
If you fall I'll catch
If you love I'll love
and so it goes my dear
don't be scared you? ll be safe
this I swear if you only love me back.
If you fall I'll catch
If you love I'll love
and so it goes my dear
don't be scared you? ll be safe
this I swear if you only love me back...
