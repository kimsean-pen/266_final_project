Met in the dark of night you were my lucky strike crazy kids with out a clue;
hanging from our knees up in the willow trees easy like the month of June;
a fairytale gone right with no ending in sight had me tangled up in blue;
you said we'd never change but maybe we do...
Baby this is all we ever used to know
But I can see your colours change to red and gold

Every moment will hurt;
from the last to the ﬁrst;
and I'm trying ﬁnd a way to breathe;
Close the book and the chapter forever and after;
I'm falling like the autumn leaves;
my heart is beating like a million drums;
cuz your the ground under my feet;
I'm trying to hold on but baby I'm falling free;
Like the autumn leaves

Baby this is all we ever used to know
But I can see your colours change to red and gold

Every moment will hurt;
from the last to the ﬁrst;
and I'm trying ﬁnd a way to breathe;
Close the book and the chapter forever and after;
I'm falling like the autumn leaves;
my heart is beating like a million drums;
cuz your the ground under my feet;
I'm trying to hold on but baby I'm falling free;
Like the autumn leaves
