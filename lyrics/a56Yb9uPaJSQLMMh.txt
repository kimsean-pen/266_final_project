First thing I remember
Was asking Papa, "Why?"
For there were many things I didn't know
And Daddy always smiled
Took me by the hand
Saying, "Someday you'll understand"

Well, I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast, you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes

The time and tears went by
And I collected dust
For there were many things I didn't know
When Daddy went away
He said, "Try to be a man
And someday you'll understand"

But I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast, you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes

And then one day in April
I wasn't even there
For there were many things I didn't know
A son was born to me
Mama held his hand
Saying, "Someday you'll understand"

Well, I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast, you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes
Ooh, someday never comes

Think it was September
The year I went away
For there were many things I didn't know
And I still see him standin'
Tryin' to be a man
I said, "Someday you'll understand"

But I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast, you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes
Ooh, someday never comes
