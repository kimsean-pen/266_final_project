It's like I've got nothing to do but think about you

Everyday is a new day and I don't have to pretend
All my friends think I'm crazy but I don't want this to end

When I have the chance I wanna say to you
Wishing I could take back what I put you through, I'll never do it again
We're like oil and water still we somehow mix
And what used to be broken is somehow fixed, it's hard to explain

I know some people say that opposites attract
If that's the truth then we, we will be together forever

It's like I got nothing to do but think about you
I've got all the time in the world
If you look in my heart you'll know from the start
That's it's all I can do not to think about you

I gave you good reason to walk out that door
Let me tell you I've learned a thing or two
And I'm so amazed at the things you do
Now don't let me go oh no

I know some people say that opposites attract
If that's the truth then we, we're meant to be together forever

It's like I got nothing to do but think about you
I've got all the time in the world
If you look in my heart you'll know from the start
That's it's all I can do not to think about you

I know some people say that opposites attract
If that's the truth then we, we belong together forever

It's like I got nothing to do but think about you
I've got all the time in the world
If you look in my heart you'll know from the start
That's it's all I can do not to think about you

Nothing to do but think about you
I've got all the time in the world
If you look in my heart you'll know from the start
That's it's all I can do not to think about you
