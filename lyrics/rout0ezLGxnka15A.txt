I've watched my life flash right before my eyes just one too many times
I've graced the Devil's lips, her kiss of death, but somehow I'm alright
I take another pill so I won't feel the pain
This mess I've made, I'll celebrate it on the day I die
I am not alright
Show me the truth, I'm sick of the lies
Why must we pretend
Repeating this over and over again?

Stay away, this is your last warning
I am not the same, please, do not adore me
It's not your fault, what have I done? Who can I trust?
I don't belong here, and I have lost my way again
Stay away from me

I've had this mindset that it's me against the world since I was born
Don't want your company, don't fuck with me, can't say I did not warn
I got my back to the wall, there ain't no person to call
I fall and get back up again
The only thing that I've known, I do it all on my own, alone
That's how it's always, how it's always been

Stay away, this is your last warning
I am not the same, please, do not adore me
It's not your fault, what have I done? Who can I trust?
I don't belong here, and I have lost my way again
Stay away from me

Stay, stay, stay away
This is true, I'm telling you
Just stay, stay, stay away
Don't misconstrue, I'm warning you

Stay away, this is your last warning
I am not the same, please, do not adore me
It's not your fault, what have I done? Who can I trust?
I don't belong here, and I have lost my way again
Stay away from me
Just stay away from me
Stay away from me
