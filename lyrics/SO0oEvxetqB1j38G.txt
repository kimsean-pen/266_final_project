Love is hard to find
Girl, give me some time to say (To say)
That I love you (Love you)
Not time to say goodbye
Always wonder why you cry (You cry)
Tell me, baby (Baby)

Love is hard to find
Girl, give me some time to say (To say)
That I love you (Love you)
Not time to say goodbye
Always wonder why you cry (You cry)
Tell me, baby (Baby)

The words are on my mind
But, girl, give me some time to feel what I need to
And when the time is right
And we're moving with the night, you'll know that I love you
(Love you)

You and I, we cannot be replaced, no
'Cause you and I
You and I will find a way
You and I will find a way

Girl, give me some time to say (To say)
That I love you (Love you)
Not time to say goodbye
Always wonder why you cry (You cry)
Tell me, baby (Baby)

I think it's been a year
You know I got my fears I'm almost facing
And while the city sleeps
I think I found some peace through you
No more chasing
'Cause

You and I, cannot be replaced, no
'Cause you and I, you and I will find a way
You and I will find a way

Love is hard to find
Girl, give me some time to say (To say)
That I love you (Love you)
Not time to say goodbye
Always wonder why you cry (You cry)
Tell me, baby (Baby)

Girl, give me some time to say that I love you
Not time to say goodbye
And I always wonder why you cry
Tell me, baby
Love is hard to find
Girl, give me some time to say that I love you
Not time to say goodbye
And I always wonder why you cry
Tell me, baby
