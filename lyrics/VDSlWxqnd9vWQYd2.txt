From birth we're taught
How to survive
We're taught how war is waged
And there are no men now alive
Who stops our wild rampage

Light at heart we bide our bane
Whatever death await
Norsemen live without regrets
We accept our woven fate

So fearlessly we charge ahead
There is no time to hesitate

Don't despair, show no fear
Live you life without regrets
Don't despair and show no fear
In the face of a certain death!

A coward thinks he'll always live
If he keeps himself from strife;
Old age leaves no rest and peace
Though spears may spare his life

We don't mourn
A friend that fell
Or dread the day
We'll fall ourselves
Warriors don't go to hel
'Cause we know
Ygg will greet us well

So fearlessly we charge ahead
There is no time to hesitate

Don't despair, show no fear
Live you life without regrets
Don't despair and show no fear
In the face of a certain death!

So raise your horns
To those who died
Let's drink to
Fallen friends tonight
Let's celebrate their glory life
We'll meet again in Valhall...
...when we die!
