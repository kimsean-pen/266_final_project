As I recall when my stomach turned
And I was hiding away from myself
Away from you
Like nothing though something was terribly wrong
And I admit that I was only waiting for the right time, night time
The right moment for you to look away
Though you never did I pretended for a while
So I could walk where I don't belong

I remember every word you said
Come back in time come back
And I remember I would soon be dead
Pitiful so pitiful

But I know, as they hammered those nails, into your beautiful hands
Your eyes they tried to search for mine
But I look away
Now your eyes are the only thing that can save me
I'm still afraid of them piercing
You're breaking into my prison
Just pretended for a while
I still decided to walk away

I remember every word you said
Come back in time come back
And I remember I would soon be dead
Pitiful so pitiful

Pitiful
Pitiful
Your Pitiful
Pitiful
So Pitiful

And I remember every word you said
But this time I won't look away
And I remember every word you said
And this time I won't look away

And I remember every word you said
Come back in time come back
And I remember I would soon be dead
Pitiful so pitiful

And I remember every word you said (pitiful)
Come back in time come back (pitiful)
And I remember I would soon be dead(pitiful)
Pitiful so pitiful
