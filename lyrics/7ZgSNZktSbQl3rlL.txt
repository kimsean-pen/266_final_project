Another morning, nothing is new
We're part of the crowd, but it's just me and you
So strange, we're strangers, too

I don't mean to say, but what can I do
I wanna' say hi, but look down at my shoes
Too shy, too shy to make a move

I, I am visible
I wonder what your name is
Or even what you'd say if I said

Woah oh oh, nice to meet you
In my head, that's how I'll greet you
Do you know that we can be more than just passengers?

When I get to know you
Left an empty seat here for you
Don't you see that we can be more than just passengers?
Woah oh oh

Whoever knew that right in this train
Would somehow become the best part of my day
With you at every stop along the way

I am just a fool, falling for you
It's funny how you don't have a clue
Wonder if I let bring myself to say

Woah oh oh, nice to meet you
In my head, that's how I'll greet you
Do you know that we can be more than just passengers?

When I get to know ya'
Left an empty seat here for ya'
Don't you see that we can be more than just passengers?

Maybe tomorrow, the timing will be right
And I won't walk out this time, if I say...

Woah oh oh, nice to meet you
In my head, that's how I'll greet you
Do you know that we can be more than just passengers?

Oh oh, nice to meet you
In my head, that's how I'll greet you
Do you know that we can be more than just passengers?

When I get to know ya'
Left an empty seat here for you
Don't you see that we can be more than just passengers?
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
