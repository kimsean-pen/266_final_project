Won't you send me
Send me a message of love?
Tells me you're lonely tonight
Tells me you want me to love you
And hold you so tight
Send me a message of love
I'm waiting here
My heart is crying
Book of love
Your words are lying
There is nothing left to say
Baby, I thought it could be forever
Shared the days and the nights together
Baby, please come back and stay
Won't you send me
Send me a message of love?
Comes to my heart when I sleep
Tells me you're feeling so true
And your passions go deep
Won't you send me
Send me a message of love?
Tells me you're lonely tonight
Tells me you want me to love you
And hold you so tight
You're like is all I always listen
Deep my heart I feel the rhythm
And your love is like a kiss
Send me a dream to share together
Side to side and keep forever
Like all the love I miss
Send me a message of love
