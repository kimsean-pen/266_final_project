I wake up every morning
I hear your feet on the stairs
Youre in the next apartment
I hear you singing over there

This groove is out of fashion
These beats are 20 years old
I saw you lend a hand to
The ones out standing in the cold

Strange Overtones in the music you are playing
Ill harmonize
It is strong and you are tough
But a heart is not enough

Put on your socks and mittens
Its getting colder tonight
A snowball in my kitchen
I watched it melt before my eyes

Your song still needs a I know youll figure it out
The rising of the verses
A change of key will let you out

Strange overtones though theyre slightly out of fashion
Ill harmonize
I see the music in your face
That your words cannot explain

Strange Overtones in the music you are playing
Were not alone
It is strong and you are tough
But a heart is not enough
