You should say (see?) it
Everyday
The more (?)
Is the same

It's not for us to say
But why not?
'Cause we've got

Another petrol fire
Another dead excuse
Another crumpled spine*
Another year of abuse

It's not for us to say
It's not for us to say
But why not?

We went down
To the bank (/bay?)
Turned round
Looked back

We went around the flag
And for what?
'Cause they've got

Another petrol fire
Another dead excuse
Another crumpled spine
Another year of abuse

We went around the flag
But for what?
