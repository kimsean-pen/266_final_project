You're the bravest of hearts
You're the strongest of souls
You're my light in the dark
You're the place I call home

You can say it's all right
But I know that you're breaking up inside
I see it in your eyes
Even you face the night
Afraid and alone
That's why I'll be there

When the storm rises up
When the shadows descend
Every beat of my heart
Every day without end

Every second I live
That's the promise I make
Baby, that's what I'll give
If that's what it takes
If that's what it takes

You can sleep in my arms
You don't have to explain
When your heart's crying out
Baby, whisper my name

'Cause I've reached out for you
When the thunder is crashing up above
You've given me your love
When you smile like the sun
That shines through the rain
That's why I'll be there

When the storm rises up
When the shadows descend
Every beat of my heart
Every day without end

I will stand like a rock
I will bend 'til I break
'Til there's no more to give
If that's what it takes

I will risk everything
I will fight, I will bleed
I will lay down my life
If that's what you need

Every second I live
That's the promise I make
Baby, that's what I'll give
If that's what it takes

Through the wind and the rain
Through the smoke and the fire
When the fear rises up
When the wave's ever higher

I will lay down my heart
My body, my soul
I will hold on all night
And never let go

Every second I live
That's the promise I make
Baby, that's what I'll give
If that's what it takes

If that's what it takes
Whatever it takes
Whatever it takes
If that's what it takes
Oh ooh
Whatever, whatever it takes
