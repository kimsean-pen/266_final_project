So I found our old haunts
Where I never thought I'd be alone
Well I got what I wanted
How wrong I was to wish such a thing

Now I escape to those places
To get away from the grey
And the piles of reasons
To stay

There are better things to do
More valiant roles to take
I'd talk to you if only I knew what to say
It's the chemicals in my brain
I'm drying up but I'm soaked to the bone
I'm drying up but I'm soaked to the bone
I'm drying up but I'm soaked to the bone

I'll stand on my rock
Wishing to scream (Leave me alone)
But I'm too fucking pathetic (Leave me alone)
So I'll choke on my words (I'm all alone)
(Leave me alone)
And bury my head in the sand
