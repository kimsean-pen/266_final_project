Overcome by your
Moving temple
Overcome by this
Holiest of altars

So pure
So rare
To witness such an earthly goddess

That I've lost my self-control
Beyond compelled to throw this dollar
Down before your
Holiest of altars

I'd sell
My soul
My self-esteem
A dollar at a time

One chance
One kiss
One taste of you
My Magdalena

I bear witness
To this place, this prayer,
So long forgotten

So pure
So rare
To witness such an earthly goddess

That I'd sell
My soul
My self-esteem a dollar at a time

For one chance
One kiss
One taste of you
My black madonna

I'd sell
My soul
My self-esteem
A dollar at a time

One taste
One taste
One taste of you
My Magdalena.
