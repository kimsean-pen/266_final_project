Every time that I look in the mirror
all these lines on my face getting clearer
the past is gone
it went by like dusk to dawn
isn't that the way
everybody's got their dues in life to pay

Yeah, I know nobody knows
where it comes and where it goes
I know everybody's sin
you got to lose to know how to win

Half my life's in books' written pages
lived and learned from fools and from sages
you know it's true
all those things come back to you

Sing with me, sing for the years
sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
sing with me, if it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away, take you away

Yeah, sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Dream on, dream on, dream on
dream yourself a dream come true
dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dream comes true
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away...
