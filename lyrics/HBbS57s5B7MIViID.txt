Help yourself make things right
So recklessly, lost for words
Fall apart right in front of me
Don't hold back, roll your eyes, now you understand
Take your time, it was over before it began

Don't know what to say, it's harder than you think
You try to get away, just look before you leap
All I do is hide, but they know to find me
Thought that I was safe, relentlessly reminded
Try your best to shake me, always think I'm tired
This constant give and take, I'm hanging from a wire

Calm yourself, all this madness in the mystery
Take me down, on the edge of something we can't see

Don't know what to say, it's harder than you think
You try to get away, just look before you leap
All I do is hide, but they know to find me
Thought that I was safe, relentlessly reminded
Try your best to shake me, always think I'm tired
This constant give and take, I'm hanging from a wire
Don't know what to say, it's harder than you think
You try to get away, just look before you leap
It's never like they say,
so try to understand the situation rises, pulls you right back in
Try your best to shake me, always think I'm tired
This constant give and take, I'm hanging from a wire
