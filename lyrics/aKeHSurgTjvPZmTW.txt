When there's trouble you know who to call
Teen Titans!
From their towers they can see it all
Teen Titans!
When there's evil on the attack
You can rest knowing they've got your back
Cause when the world needs heroes on patrol
Teen Titans, Go!
With their super powers they unite
Teen Titans
Never met a villain that they liked
Teen Titans
They've got the bad guys on the run
They never stop till the job gets done
Cause when the world is losing all control
Teen Titans, Go!
Teen Titans, Go!
If your heart is black
you better watch out
You cannot escape the team
When they catch you
there won't be any doubt
You've been beaten by the teens
beaten by the teens
T-E-E-N T-I-T-A-N-S
Teen Titans, let's go!
T-E-E-N T-I-T-A-N-S

When there's trouble you know who to call

Teen Titans!
When there's evil on the attack
You can rest knowing they've got your back
Cause when the world needs heroes on patrol
Teen Titans, Go!
