I am just a jangling man
Been in the cold too long-along-along

They're breaking glass and burning buildings
In the early greenhouse sun
The powers-that-be will blame extremists
And I may well be one
And all you kids in Cardboard City
I hope you're having fun
And all you voters everywhere
Will remember what you've done
Remember what you've done

And I am just a jangling man
Been in the cold too long-along-along
And I live with a Raggedy-Ann
We never had any money, is it really so wrong?

The velvet glove, the iron rod and a bridle for your tongue
The tanks which trundle through the square
When the old have killed the young
The wind feels all the colder now that the summer's on the run
The old man sees the wall come down and he reaches for his gun
He reaches for his gun

And I am just a jangling man
Been in the cold too long-along-along
And I live with a Raggedy-Ann
We never had any money, is it really so wrong?

When we dream
Dream of a feeling
To wake one day and find that you are gone
And will we dance?
Dance by your gravesides
So glad, so glad, so glad that you are gone

So wander dimly through the past
Of the England that you knew
These dispossessed and homeless children
They all belong to you
They all belong to you

And I am just a jangling man
Been in the cold too long-along-along
And I live with a Raggedy-Ann
We never had any money, is it really so wrong?
