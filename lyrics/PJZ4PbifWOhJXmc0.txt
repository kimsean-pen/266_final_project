Wooh
I Look At You
You Look At Me
(You Can't Help It Yeah We're Feeling Butterflies)
It's obvious
We got some Chemistry
(I think I know what it feels so right)
Now I wanted so long to know
Now You're telling me you gotta let it go
(Dont Tell Me I have to start all over again)
I Never thought this day would come
(This is something that I've wanted in my life)
I realize that you're the one
(and you're telling me it's time to say goodbye)
What's inside of my heart It ain't gonna change
So it shouldn't be so easy to walk away
(You feel it I feel it Let's not pretend let's not pretend)

Maybe I Don't Know What Love Is
Maybe I'm A Fool
I Just Know What I'm Feeling
And It's All Because Of You
Don't Tell Me
I Don't Know
I Want The Truth
Cause They Call It
We Call It
You Call It

I Call It Love

It's so clear for you to see
(Don't let nobody tell you what to do)
Why they can't they just let us be happy
(I don't want to find somebody new)
If you know what's really in your heart

Then don't let 'em tear us apart
(Cause you feel it I feel it Let's think it through)

Maybe I Don't Know What Love Is (Maybe I'm a fool)
Maybe I'm A Fool
I Just Know What I'm Feeling
And It's All Because Of You (Please don't)
Don't Tell Me
I Don't Know
I Want The Truth
Cause They Call It (Yeah)

We Call It (Yeah)
You Call It (Wooh)
I Call It Love

We Have a bond that's unbreakable
And it's not time to let it go (We're in love)
And now that we know it's real

We're going to let it show
To the whole world

That I'm yours forever
and you're my girl

You're my everything
Ooh, I don't know

Maybe I Don't Know What Love Is
Maybe I'm A Fool (Maybe I'm a fool)
I Just Know What I'm Feeling
And It's All Because Of You (It's all because of you)
Don't Tell Me
I Don't Know

I Want The Truth (I want the truth)
Cause They Call It (They call)
We Call It
You Call It
I Call It Love
Maybe I Don't Know What Love Is

Maybe I'm A Fool (I call it)
I Just Know What I'm Feeling
And It's All Because Of You (All cause of you)
Don't Tell Me
I Don't Know (Baby)
I Want The Truth
Cause They Call It (They call)
We Call It (We call)
You Call It (You call)
I Call It Love (I call it)
