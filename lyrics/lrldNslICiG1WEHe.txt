Well with buck shot eyes and a purple heart
I rolled down the national stroll
And with a big fat paycheck
Strapped to my hip sack
And a shore leave wristwatch underneath
My sleeve
In a Hong Kong drizzle on Cuban heels
I rowed down the gutter to the Blood Bank
And I'd left all my papers on the Ticonderoga
And was in a bad need of a shave
And so I slopped at the corner on cold chow mein
And shot billards with a midget
Until the rain stopped
And I bought a long sleeved shirt
With horses on the front
And some gum and a lighter and a knife
And a new deck of cards (with girls on the back)
And I sat down and wrote a letter to my wife

And I said Baby, I'm so far away from home
And I miss my Baby so
I can't make it by myself
I love you so

Well I was pacing myself
Trying to make it all last
Squeezing all the life
Out of a lousy two day pass
And I had a cold one at the Dragon
With some Filipino floor show
And talked baseball with a lieutenant
Over a Singapore sling
And I wondered how the same moon outside
Over this Chinatown fair
Could look down on Illinois
And find you there
And you know I love you Baby

And I'm so far away from home
And I miss my Baby so
I can't make it by myself
I love you so

Shore Leave.
Shore Leave.
