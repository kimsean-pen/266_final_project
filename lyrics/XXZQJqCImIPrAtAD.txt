Make me a memory

How do I make my life something to remember?
Give a purpose to raise into the smoke
I'm on my needs oh God I'm losing direction
Give me a purpose, show me my path

Hear me
Fighting eternity
Hear me
I need more time to find my place
Do You see me now?
Do You hear me now?
Will You reach down?

In the darkness we're divided
Tearing at the seems
Burning bridges, that's the light
It shows us who to blame
Will I see a memory?

I keep calling father, further from the answers
Will this haunt you and fall in isolation?
Show me my path

In the darkness we're divided
Tearing at the seems
Burning bridges, that's the light
It shows us who to blame
In the darkness we're divided
Tearing at the seems
Burning bridges, that's the light
It shows us who to blame

Hear me
Fighting eternity
Hear me
I need time to find my place
So my heart is done, I don't feel hopeless
I am not afraid, I am timeless

In the darkness we're divided
Tearing at the seems
Burning bridges, that's the light
It shows us who to blame
In the darkness we defy it tearing at the seems
Burning bridges, that's the light
It shows us who to blame

Will I see
Will I see
Will I see a memory

Make me a memory
