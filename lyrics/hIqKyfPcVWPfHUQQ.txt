Make it easy
You give in to everything
I know you, I know you
It's what you do, what you do

There's no need to disappear
I've got room for you in here
Tonight, tonight
Tell you why, tell you why

I've been longing after you
Longing after you since the start
Oh and all you have to do
All you have to do is drop by

So shut up the bedroom door
And shut out the world some more
I know your head gets sore when you're not near me
And drop your clothes on the floor
You've had a hard day I know
I've had a hard day too
Forget, forget with you

Take it easy, just as long as you are here
You'll be fine, you'll be fine
You know why, you know why

I've been longing after you
Longing after you since the start
Oh and all you have to do
All you have to do is drop by

So shut up the bedroom door
And shut out the world some more
I know your head gets sore when you're not near me
And drop your clothes on the floor
You've had a hard day I know
I've had a hard day too
Forget, forget with you

Forget about the work you need to do
Forget about how hard it is for you
Forget about the things you need to say
I see it in your eyes I feel the same
Remember all the times I used to hurt
Remember all the tings you helped me learn
Well darling I am here to help you too
I am heere to help you ooh-ooh

So shut up the bedroom door
And shut out the world some more
I know your head gets sore when you're not near me
And drop your clothes on the floor
You've had a hard day I know
I've had a hard day too
Forget, forget with you
