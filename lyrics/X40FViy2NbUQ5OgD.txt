Well people don't see what I see
Even when them right there
Standing next to me
And all of my friends think I'm crazy for loving you
But they don't know
There's nothing else I can do

- And it's too bad 'cause Love Is Blind
(It's too bad It's too bad)
oh oh oh
It's too bad 'cause Love Is Blind
(It's too bad So Bad)
oh oh oh oh oh
It's too bad 'cause Love Is Blind
(It's too bad it don't matter Baby)
eh eh eh
It's too bad 'cause Love Is Blind
(It's too bad So Sad)

oh oh oh oh oh -

See people don't know what I know
They say I'm losing my mind
I know I'm losing control
Eh eh eh ehhh
All of my friends think I'm crazy but I don't care
I'm over the edge, no turning back

Belong to you I swear
Ay!

- It's too bad 'cause Love Is Blind
(It's too bad It's too bad)
