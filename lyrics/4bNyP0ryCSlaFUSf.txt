change your way of limping around the world
cause you know what will come soon
a real broken leg
and you this will come true
you cannot get away
daylight, dawn and evening, around the world
and you know what will come to
do I have to say?
everybody will eat you
everybody robs graves
and our ghosts stay forever confined
in wherever we haunt and hopelessly
want to but cannot get away
and our bones do blow away
in pink light
