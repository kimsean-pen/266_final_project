Deep breaths, cold in the depth
Entrapped by illusions and filled with regret
A small leap, careful whats beneath
There's a shadow that follows towards the rugged edge

Now can you hear the alarm, a storm behind your rear?
It curves and it bends, and it takes and it tears

Quick, turn or you might get burned
There's a howl beneath the surface, of voice within your skin
Row, safe, aware and afraid
Although you must know there's light still again

Now can you hear the alarm, a storm behind your rear?
It curves and it bends, and it takes and it tears
Now a blitzkrieg, a storm, fighters within the waves
Creatures appear, and your caught in a wall of flames

Slowly as we sunk, we sung undying songs
Slowly as we sunk, we felt we were not done
Slowly as we sunk, sung our ocean songs
Slowly as we sunk, we felt we were not done

Deep breaths, cold in the depth
Entrapped by illusions and filled with regret
A small leap, careful whats beneath
There's a shadow that follows towards the rugged edge

Now can you hear the alarm, a storm behind your rear?
It curves and it bends, and it takes and it tears
Now a blitzkrieg, a storm, fighters within the waves
Creatures appear, and your caught in a wall of flames
