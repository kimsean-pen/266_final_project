Ahh, not even
A year has gone by
Already you've got? him/in?
I want to see where I am

When I live in the the newer places
I'll make sure I am further from you
If problems come two by two
I know its not the truth

Is this how it ends?
I so want to be here
Obsessed with ideas
That leave no one impressed

Often nights? end/and? in the morning for me
Out on the floor where I see more? love come?

Is this how we live?
I so want to be here
Obsessed with ideas
That leave no one impressed

Ahh, not even
A year has gone by
Already you've got? him/in?
I want to see where I am
