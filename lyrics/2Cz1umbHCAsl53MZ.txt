Everybody get ready
It's time to rocksteady
It's ba ba boom, yes it is
Don't lose the beat, now
Just dip your head, now
It's festival fire, listen here
You hear the people saying

Boom boom, ba ba boom boom
Boom boom festival
Boom boom, ba ba boom boom
Boom boom festival
Boom boom, ba ba boom boom
Boom boom festival
Boom boom, ba ba boom boom

People are dancing
Teenagers romancing
It's ba ba boom time, listen here
Freddie get ready
Come do the rocksteady
It's ba ba boom time, listen here
You hear the people saying

Boom boom, ba ba boom boom
Boom boom festival
Boom boom, ba ba boom boom
Boom boom festival
Boom boom, ba ba boom boom
Boom boom festival
Boom boom, ba ba boom boom

People are dancing
Teenagers romancing
It's ba ba boom time, listen here
Freddie get ready
Come do the rocksteady
It's festival fire, listen here
You hear the children saying

Boom boom, ba ba boom boom
Boom boom festival
Boom boom, ba ba boom boom
