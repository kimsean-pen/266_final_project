If I have to go
I will be thinking of your love
Oh, somehow you'll know
You'll know
Thinking of your love

Slyly they whispered away
As I played the last post on the bugle
I heard them say
"Oh, that boy's no different today
Except in every single way."

If I have to go
I will be thinking of your love
Oh, somehow you'll know
You'll just know
Thinking of your love

Oh, I was carried away
Caught up in an affray
And as they led him away, he sang,
"We'll meet again some day;
Oh my boy, there's a price to pay."

If I have to go
I will be thinking of your love
Oh, somehow you'll know
I don't know how, but you'll know
Thinking of your love

La la-la, la-la la-la...

Inside I felt so, so alone
Locked in a room
Waiting 'til kingdom come
Although I felt elated
I felt like I was scum

I was carried away
Caught up in an affray
As they led him away, he sang,
"We'll meet again some day;
Oh my boy, there's a price to pay."

Feel like I have never been away
Though it's been longer than I could possibly say
I've been wandering the market
Carrying a sign, saying the end of
The world is nigh
I'm glad to see we're still tight
The bonds that tie a man are tight
Yet we do what we do
With ritual habituality
All through the night
