You talk your talk like you're something else something else
You're walking down the street all by yourself
You're spending money
Don't know where it comes from
I'm not a fan of you
I'm not a fan of you at all
Oh no so syndicated
God damn so medicated
Oh no I'm misbehaving
Oh no
I don't feel quite right
There's something on the air tonight
Must be the way she's looking at me
Is there somethig wrong
Is there something wrong with me
I don't feel quite right
There's something in the air now tonight
Must be the words that she speaks
Is there something wrong
Is there something wrong with me
Something is wrong
Oh na na na na oh
You walk but you're falling down, you're falling down
High heels on the cat walk up or down
You spending money
Don't know where it comes from
You change your hair
You change your lips
But you'll never find your fix

Must be the words that she speaks
