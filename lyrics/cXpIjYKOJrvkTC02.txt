I've got a crush on me
I've got a crush on me
I've got a crush on me (I've got a crush on me)
I've got a crush on me
(One, two, three, four)

When I wake up every morning and I look at myself
And wonder where this face would be on somebody else
Yeah, I wake up in the evening and I look at myself
With a rose between my lips and all my friends on the shelves

And right before it's over, before I hide it for good
I remember something special, something I only could

I've got a crush on me
I've got a crush on me
I've got a crush on me
I've got a crush on me
I've got a crush on me (I've got a crush on me)
I've got a crush on me (I've got a crush on me)
I've got a crush on me (I've got a crush on me)
I've got a crush on me (I've got a crush on me)
(I've got a crush on me)

So, yeah, I have a new crush
I didn't want to tell you until it was official
But, I have aâ€“
It's on me, um we're just gonna ride this one out
We're gonna see where it takes us
I'm not trying to project too much into the future
But I do have a good feeling about this one, so
