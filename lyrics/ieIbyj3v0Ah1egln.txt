Leave your past at the front door
And run away like you did before
Blisters, blisters, blisters

Let's consider a change of scenery
It's getting boring by the sea
Pictures, pictures, pictures

Oh, oh no, no, no
Can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself out, oh no, no, no
Can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself out

Such a harsh tongue used so easily
Never hear it much in front of me
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet

Let's consider a change of scenery
It's getting boring by the sea
Pictures, pictures, pictures

Oh, oh no, no, no
Can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself out, oh no, no, no
Can't escape anything in this town

Knock yourself out, oh no, no, no
Can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself out, oh no, no, no
Can't escape anything in this town

Can't escape anything in this town
(Can't escape) Anything in this town
(Can't escape) Anything in this town
(Can't escape) Anything in this town
Leave your past at the front door
And run away like you did before
Blisters, blisters, blisters
Let's consider a change of scenery
It's getting boring by the sea
Pictures, pictures, pictures
