On a boat on my sailing ship on my own
far away from it give me death, but don't give me this
I'll pass if that's ok
to rave on
rave on
so rave on
rave on
in a class where you got her (name)?
feel your lovers lips on your favorite day
in your mother's arm's when you blast away
i'll pass if that's ok
on a stage where you love to play
on your knees look for words to say
thank God every single day
I'll pass if that's ok
to rave on
rave on
so rave on
rave on
on a boat on the sailing ship, of my own
far away from it, give me death but don't give me this
i'll pass if that's ok
to rave on
rave on
so rave on
rave on
to rave on
rave on
so rave on
rave on
