Breathe you out, breathe you in
You keep coming back to tell me
You're the one who could have been
In my eyes, see it all so clear
It was long ago and far away but it never disappears

I try to put it in the past
Hold into myself and don't look back

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under)
So let me go

Just let me fly away
Let me feel the space between us growing deeper
And much darker everyday
Watch me now and I'll be someone new
My heart will be unbroken
It will open up for everyone but you
Even when I cross the line

It's like a lie I've told a thousand times
I don't wanna dream about

All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under)
And part of me still believes when you say you're gonna stick around
And part of me still believes we can find a way to work it out

But I know that we tried everything we could try
So let's just say goodbye
Forever
I don't wanna dream about

All the things that never were

Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
And I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
And I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under)
