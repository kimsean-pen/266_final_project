Hey, Hanzo

Rain on my chain, I been feelin' like a loser (Loser)
Lately makin' money on a snowboard
Taped a firework to my kicks so I could fly (Fly)
Broke the hourglass, now I'm really out of time
Hustling's a hard habit to break (Break)
Crossover with the Wilson, got 'em on roller skates
Make 'em nervous like a first date (Date)
Double Gs on my armor, on my breastplate

Got green light, Rayquaza
Stash the money in my blazer
Make sure the gang straight like a laser
Shoot myself, confetti cannon (Confetti cannon)
Hit the ground runnin' once we landed (Once we landed)
James Franco, Freaks and Geeks bankroll
I-I-I-I-I get bread, you can't even get a bread roll
Icy by myself like the North Pole
Drip so much, walk around with a snorkel
Beat bounce like Snorlax on a treadmill
You take me out the Matrix like a blue pill
Lost memories end up in the landfill
Lost memories end up in the landfill

Rain on my chain, I been feelin' like a loser (Loser)
Lately makin' money on a snowboard
Taped a firework to my kicks so I could fly (Fly)
Broke the hourglass, now I'm really out of time
Hustling's a hard habit to break (Break)
Crossover with the Wilson, got 'em on roller skates
Make 'em nervous like a first date (Date)
Double Gs on my armor, on my breastplate

In a treasure chest, found a hundred bands
My reflection in your Ray-Bans
Like a mirror but much clearer
This is real life, just underwater
Knots on my head like I bumped it
Yeah, I need the cash like a organ
Got some hollow eyes like a pumpkin
Doesn't scare me, I just don't trust 'em

(Doesn't scare me, I just don't trust 'em
Just don't trust 'em)
