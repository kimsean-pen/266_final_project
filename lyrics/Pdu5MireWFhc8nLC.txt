I listened so well
And did everything
Like you said
I behaved so good
And sat silently
Like you said

I want you to give me
One more chance
I want you to give it to me

Give it to me
If you want to make me happy
Like you said

I took my finger
And I placed it in your hand;
And I filled my cup up
With liquid of your glance

I want you to give me
One more chance
I want you to give it to me
Give it to me
If you want to make me happy
Like you said
Oh, give it to me
If you want to make me happy
Like you said

Your head and my head
Now I know
I can't never get out your lungs
Into my lungs
Now I know
I can't never get out your fears
Into my fears
Now I know
I can't never get out, get out
Get out...

Oh, give it to me
If you want to make me happy
Like you said

Your head and my head
Your lungs and my lungs
Your fears and my fears
Your blood is mine
