When we're on our own
No time to go home
You say the simple things
A smile it always brings
And I see you, as you want me to
As you want me to...
That's how I see you
When we're on our way
No thoughts for today
You look toward the sky
Dreaming you could fly
And you see me, as I want to be
As I want to be...
That's how you see me
