Firstly, we lived in a crater where our eyes glowed...
We secrete leaders of secrecy... hello.

What do you picture makes a frame,
What you do everyday is the same.
Turn off the lights and shake your hips,
Let's make like a couplet, like two pairs of lips.

Pop goes the ceiling of routine...
Pop goes the feeling of sitting...

Blow your head on the turn of the fan -- don't put another down payment on the oil of Iran. (?)
Blow your head on the turn of the fan -- don't put another down payment on the oil of Iran. (?)
Can't you see you've got honourable mention?
Can't you see you've got no pension plan?

It's time to decide -- we make it or we die.

Hey, nuclear war and a hotbed of trouble!
Make with the penance, repent on the double.
We're going down in smoke and flames!
We're going down and there's no one to blame!

So keep it cold in a cool, dry place in a tucked away space...
Save it with the face.
Clean the egg, don't make me beg.

Save us...
