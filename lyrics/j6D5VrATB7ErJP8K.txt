Wired, tired
All so uninspired
What weighs me down?
Barely breathing, loosing sense of meaning

What weighs me down?
What weighs me down?
What weighs me down?

Aspire, there's so much to live for
Inspire, there's so much to give
Aspire, there's so much to live for
Inspire, there's so much to give

Undergoing. never really knowing what weighs me down
Undergoing. never really knowing what weighs me down

What weighs me down
What weighs me down, down
Aspire, inspire...
Aspire, there's so much to live for
Inspire, there's so much to give.
