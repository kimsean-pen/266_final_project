Lay down your arms, and surrender to me
Lay down your arms, and love me peacefully

Use your arms to squeeze, please
I'm the one who loves you so

There ain't no reason for you to declare a war
I'm the one who loves you so
So forget the other boys, cos my love is real
Come off your battlefield

Lay down your arms, and surrender to me
Lay down your arms, and love me peacefully, yeah

Use your arms to squeeze, please
that's the way it's got to be

The weapons that you're usin'
Are hurtin' me bad
But someday you're gonna retreat
coz my love, baby, is the truest you ever had
I'm a soldier of love, that's hard to beat
Lay down your arms, and surrender to me
Lay down your arms, and love me peacefully
Use your arms to hold me tight
Baby, I don't want to fight, no more Baby, lay down your arms, baby baby
Oh, please, baby lay down your arms
