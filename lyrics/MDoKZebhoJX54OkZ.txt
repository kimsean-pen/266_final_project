No one ever loved
No one ever knows as hard as I
No one ever came,
No one ever saw the crystal light
In these eyes starry sky paradise
In these arms
In his arms
Crystal light fail me now
You're the God and the guarder,
You're the whole inside my heart
You're the one I will remember every night
Before the dawn meets the light

Heaven must to know
Heaven must to lay out stardust in my eyes
Shine my light, close to hurt in my eyes
See me now, heaven shine will never mind
Angel line fail right now
You're the God and the guarder,
You're the whole inside my heart
You're the one I will remember every night
Before the dawn meets the light

And it kills me every time
And it's stolen in front my eyes
Yeah, it kills me every time,
Every story for hard time

You're the God and the guarder,
You're the whole inside my heart
You're the one I will remember every night
Before the dawn
You're the God and the guarder,
You're the whole inside my heart
You're the one I will remember every night
Before the dawn!
Every night before the dawn
Every night before the dawn
Every night before the dawn meets the light!
