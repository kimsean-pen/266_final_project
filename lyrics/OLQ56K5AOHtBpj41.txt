A cocoon in a silent tree
Through the dark night you listen to me
When I whisper broken words in your ear

And you push, you push me hard to the surface
I'm blinded at heart but you wake me
You wake me up from the snow where I was born

Now I can see
The whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
I feed you my love

You put a knife against my back
And you dare me to face the attack
You say, "For cowards there's no reward"
Feel the heat

Take my hand, I trust your word
Bring the fire, I don't care if it hurts
I have the future on my tongue
Give me a kiss

Now I can see
The whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
So I feed you my love

You put a knife against my back
And you dare me to face the attack
You say, "For cowards there's no reward"
I have the future on my tongue

Now I can see
The whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
So I feed you my love

Feed you my love
So I feed you my love
