I dreamed, I was headed down to Puerto Rico
Now I'm feeling like I really gotta go
'Cause I really wanna get away
And spend some time with you

To get away 'cause my life is getting kinda crazy
And the only way to make it, is to pray
That's why I'm really gonna get away
And spend some time with you

Well, maybe
('Cause I)
I never wanna get down, never wanna let you down
(I'm thinking, once I)
Maybe once I get away, maybe put my thoughts down
(You save me)

Save me
(And I thank you)
Always
(Now I live my life)
Just for you
(So I'm saying that I'm praying everyday)
Everyday
(And I know You're gonna always stay)

Only you can keep us tight, so I pray with all my might
So I'm saying that I'm praying everyday
And I know you're gonna always stay
Only you can keep us tight, so I pray with all my might

At times, when I'm rolling with my crew and on the run
And we're kicking it all day and having fun
And we know that we should really go
And spend some time with you

My mind, it will stay and meditate on You
So when I'm down and when I'm feeling kinda blue
There's a word in my heart
That I really wanna say to you

Well, maybe
('Cause I)
I never wanna get down, never wanna let you down
(I'm thinking, once I)
Maybe once I get away, maybe put my thoughts down
(You save me)

Save me
(And I thank you)
Always
(Now I live my life)
Just for you
(So I'm saying that I'm praying everyday)
Everyday
(And I know You're gonna always stay)

Only you can keep us tight, so I pray with all my might
So I'm saying that I'm praying everyday
And I know you're gonna always stay
Only you can keep us tight, so I pray with all my might

So I saying that I'm praying everyday
And I know you're gonna always stay
Only you can keep us tight
So I pray with all my might

So I saying that I'm praying everyday
And I know you're gonna always stay
Only you can keep us tight
So I pray with all my might

We came here so we can rock the house
Blow it up and turn it out
Make you dance, make you dance
Party up and we be putting it down

Baby, baby we can rock the house
Turn it up and blow it out
Make you dance, make you dance
Stacie Joy Orrico came to rock the house
