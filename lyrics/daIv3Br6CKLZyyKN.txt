You said your peace
It's killing me
I can't believe
It's over

Your not the enemy
But underneath
You don't agree
Take comfort that
It's over

You're hands tight
You feel shy
Believe I'm on your side
Now and forever

Jealousy
Won't get you anything that you've lost
Jealousy
It will never be what it was
Jealousy
Well I'm afraid of what I've become
Jealousy
It feels like everything has come undone

Your not the enemy
But underneath
You don't agree
Take comfort that
It's over

There's an emergency
A dire need
For thr remedy
Take comfort that
It's over

Jealousy
Won't get you anything that you've lost
Jealousy
Well it will never be what it was
Jealousy
Well I'm afraid of what I've become
Jealousy
It feels like everything has come undone

No matter what the price
They can't take me
