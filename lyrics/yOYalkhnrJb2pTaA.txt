And all I remember is your back
Walking towards the airport
Leaving us all in your past
I traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you
Begged you to want me
But you didn't want to

But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah
And piece by piece, he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old

And you know, he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
He loves me
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

And all of your words fall flat
I made something of myself
And now you wanna come back
But your love, it isn't free
It has to be earned
Back then I didn't have anything you needed
So I was worthless

But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground where you abandoned things
And piece by piece, he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old

And you know, he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
'Cause he loves me

Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece

Piece by piece
I fell far from the tree
I would never leave her like you left me
She will never have to wonder her worth
Because unlike you, I'm gonna put her first
And you know, he'll never walk away
He'll never break her heart
He'll take care of things
He'll love her
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father should be great

Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
