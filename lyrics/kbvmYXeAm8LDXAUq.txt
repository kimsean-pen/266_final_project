Run!

Consider this: picture perfect sweet sorrow.
'Cause you've never been wrong before.

Never been wrong before.
Never been wrong before.

As much you wait, time wont wait for you.
As much you wait, I wont wait for you.

Let me fly.
Let me fly.
Let me fly.
Let me fly and pull away from you, from you.

You're always right.
You're always right.
You're always right.

You're always right.
You're always right.
You're always right.

Time won't wait for you.

You!

You!

You're always right.
So let me fight.
You're always right.
So let me fight.
You're always right.
So let me fight and pull away from you.

And I said, I would try for you.

This time tonight.
I wont die.
