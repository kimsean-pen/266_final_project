Living my life by the numbers
Counting backwards every day
Seeing things I let decay there
I've been watching every day

I hear you screaming, get off of my back
I hear it every day
How will it feel when your world's turning black?
How can it feel so good?

'Cause you're living
Living by the numbers
Living
Living by the numbers
'Cause you're living
Living by the numbers

Looking for the signs and wonders
Live your life in disarray
When you look into the mirror
Do you have to look away?

When will I stop living life in the black
I'm dead, I continue to plea
Why does it feel like a knife in the back?
Why can't I just walk away?

'Cause you're living
Living by the numbers
Living
Living by the numbers
'Cause you're living
Living by the numbers

Never again
Never again
Yeah

Living my life by the numbers
Counting backwards every day
Seeing things I [?]
I've been watching every day

I hear you screaming, get off of my back
I hear it every day
Why does it feel like a knife in my back?
Why can't I just walk away?

'Cause you're living
Living by the numbers
Living
Living by the numbers
'Cause you're living
Living by the numbers

'Cause you're living
Living by the numbers
Living
Living by the numbers
'Cause you're living
Living by the numbers

'Cause you're living
Living by the numbers
Living
Living by the numbers
'Cause you're living
Living by the numbers
