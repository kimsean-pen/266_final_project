We're just spinning leaves
In the flight of dawn
Little girl
Falling through an eternal horizon of time
But I'd like to think as we lie
That all we've got will be ours forever
Don't you think we're forever
I can hear a voice
On the wings of my dream
Little girl
Melting me into love as it touches my heart
But sheltered in the distance of your sleep
Is all that I could love in a lifetime
Don't you think we're forever

Open your eyes
To the call of the winds
Little girl
Can't you here them all saying I'll always be yours
Lying in the misty morning sun
The pillow of the night still beneath you
Don't you think we're forever
