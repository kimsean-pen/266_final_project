I always remember
When you were
Lost in the rain
(You looked so cute)
I knew that moment
My whole life had changed
You told me to save you (you told me)
From all the pain
In your heart (in your broken heart)
And knew that moment
We will never part
(Cross my heart)

I can give you
Everything you need
(I'll do anything)
If you'll only say (oh, say it)
You'll stay with me

All of my love
It's what I wanna
Give you everyday
Everyday I love you
I'll be there
To lift you just
A little higher (A little higher toward Heaven)
Fill your spirit with desire
All of my love
It's what I wanna
Give you everyday
Everyday I love you
I'll be there (I will be there)
To take you just
A little higher
(I promise)
Fill your body with desire
All my love

It's never ending
The flame that grows inside
(Let's turn the fire into happiness)
We're starting something
When our hearts collide (into two)

I can give you (oh woah oh oh woah!)
Everything you want
(This is our game baby)
If you'll only say (if you say)
You'll be the one

All of my love
It's what I wanna
Give you everyday
(This is like a miracle)
Everyday I love you
I'll be there
(They never said)
To lift you just
A little higher
Fill your spirit with desire (Not too much, though)
All of my love (Love)
It's what I wanna
Give you everyday (everyday)
Everyday I love you
I'll be there
To take you just (We'll do this together)
A little higher
Fill your body with desire (I promise)
Giving you all my love

I can give you (you know)
Everything you need (everything)
(This is our life)
If you'll only say (oh yeah)
You'll stay with me (ooh oh)

(Yeah!)
All of my love
It's what I wanna
Give you everyday (ooh yeah)
Everyday I love you
I'll be there
To lift you just
A little higher (To Heaven... to heaven)
Fill your spirit with desire
All of my love
(hey hey hey)
It's what I wanna
Give you everyday
(Take it off, take it off, take it off, take it off)
Everyday I love you
I'll be there
To take you just
A little higher (I say)
Fill your spirit with desire
(ooh yeah, yeah)

All of my love
(all of my love)
It's what I wanna
Give you everyday
(everyday)
Everyday I love you (I will still love you)
I'll be there
To lift you just
A little higher
Fill your body with desire
(Let's make it right)
All of my love (Take it off, take it off)
It's what I wanna
Give you everyday
Everyday I love you (Let me lift you higher)
I'll be there (I will be there)
To lift you just (Take it off, take it off)
A little higher
Fill your spirit with desire (fill it with desire)
Giving you all my love
