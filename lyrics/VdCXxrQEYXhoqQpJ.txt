So much on my mind
I think I think too much
Read between these lines
Unspoken weight of words
But time comes to rest when you are by my side, it blurs

And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrow's long to be unknown
When all is shaken, be my safety
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone

Change in every wind
The sands of time don't know our names
Oh, nothing's sure, but surely as we stand
I promise I will stay the same
And I've never seen forever
But I know we'll remain

And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrow's long to be unknown
When all is shaken, be my safety
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone
Be my stone
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone

Oh, steady me, be my source of gravity
While my world's unraveling
Say you'll never change

And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrow's long to be unknown
When all is shaken, be my safety
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone
Be my stone
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone
