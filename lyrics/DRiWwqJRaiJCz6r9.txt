You're living for today
But your future is looking bleak
One day it'll all come crashing down
Nothing lasts forever
You've only planned for the here and now
I said: Nothing lasts forever
Live fast, die young

Live fast and die young
It's what's ahead, but just remember
Slow and steady wins the race
So pick your head up and keep your mouth shut

You are the captor of originality
You are the thief of authenticity
Respect is something that you'll never see
Everything you write all sounds the same
You're forsaken
Forsaken on this mountain
The bridges have turned to ash
This is your final hour
This is your great fall

You won't make it out alive
So say your dearest goodbyes

You are Goliath standing firm in your light
We are David and you're in our sights
You are Goliath standing firm in your light
We are David and you're in our sights
Your dreams have come true
Have you forgotten the reason why?

Life, death, dreams, wealth
Nothing lasts forever
Greed, envy, gluttony will amount to
Nothing lasts forever

The earth is about to quake
The earth is about to quake
The earth is about to quake
Brace for impact, run for the hills
Brace for impact
It's a long way home
Brace for impact, run for the hills
You'll surely end here
Goliath, we're screaming your name
Goliath, we're coming for you
