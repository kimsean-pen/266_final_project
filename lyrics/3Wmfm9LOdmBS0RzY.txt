When it's twilight in Boston
That's something I know about
Because I've spent many walks
Lonely walks in the twilight
All through Boston and those Suburbs
Right now I'm imagining the Public Gardens
The Public Garden is by where the swan boats are
By the entrance that goes up to Beacon Street.

Now we're walking up Beacon Street
Through the back bay there
Few clouds, heading for Kenmore Square
When it's twilight in Boston

Taking a left
Going by the Fenway
By the Marshland Park
The little memorial
By the victory gardens
One of my favorite parts of town
Those little plots of land
And it's getting darker
Mosquitos are coming out now

When it's twilight in Boston
Headed for the riverway
Headed for the Jamaica way now

Yeah, time for adventure now
When it's twilight in Boston
When it's twilight in Boston
Time for adventure
