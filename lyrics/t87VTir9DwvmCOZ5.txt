Everything in colour
No place in between
The things I know, the thing I see
Everything in colour
My every day
Take it all away

A room full of mirrors
With nothing to see
But the things that have passed
It's like I'm falling into me

Can you teach me?
Can you teach?
Can you teach me how to love myself?
Can you teach me how to be?
Nothing more than a permanent stain
On your memory?

I'm bleeding out on display
For the world to see
I'm bleeding out on display
For the world to see

Everything in colour
No place in between
The things I know, the thing I see
Everything in colour
My every day
Take it all away
