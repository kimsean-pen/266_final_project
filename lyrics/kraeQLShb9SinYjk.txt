Women is losers, women is losers
Women is losers, oh say honey, women is losers
Well, I know you must try, Lord, and everywhere
Men almost seem to end up on top.

Oh, if they told you they want you
Say come around by your door
Whoa, I say now, if they don't desert you
They'll leave you and never be here for more.
Oh yeah!

Women is losers, women is losers
Women is losers, Lord, Lord, Lord
So now I know you must-a know, Lord, it's true
Men always seem to end up on top.

They wear a nice shiny armor
Until there is a dragon for to slay
Any day now, course with men beggin' to pay 'em
Then they'll turn and run away, oh.

Women is losers, women is losers
Women is losers, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
So I know you must-a know, Lord, anywhere
Men almost seem to end up on top, oh.
