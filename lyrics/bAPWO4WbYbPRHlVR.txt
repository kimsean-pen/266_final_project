On gallows high, where the blood flows the reddest
The noblest place to die is where we die the deadest
Deception your sin, the world will give in, delusions
Of the cowards
I've seen Babylon, her fires burn so white
The whole world lay in pandamine
We grasp our rifles tight
All is redeemed when the fates have been see
The chronicles of miles
Here lies Babylon, it's come within the hour
Trumpets awake to warn the world
The milk of time has soured
Deception your sin, the world will give in
Delusion of the cowards
(repeat 1st verse)
(repeat 1st "I've seen Babylon")
