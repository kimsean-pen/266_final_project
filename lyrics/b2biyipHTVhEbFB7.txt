I'm leaving the wat. To Buddism no longer loyal
I'm breaking my heart, as my compassion to the third world
turned to greed

Bye bye real mccoy, no ideal as if I was royal
now im a material boy
Theres nothing in this world I don't think I need

Now I'm shopping im not stopping
There will always be new stuff to buy
And I will expand my needs somehow yeah
Now I'm shopping I'm not stopping
There will always be new stuff to buy
And I will expand my needs somehow I swear

I bought a new imac and mouse, a phone to go with
My new spirit
Next step might be a house, six bedrooms and a pool
Just for me
I will live like star, the beggars chant wont hear it
I'll have boat, new TV and car
And in mouth a fat cuban cigar

Now I'm shopping im not stopping
There will always be new stuff to buy
And I will expand my needs somehow yeah
Now I'm shopping I'm not stopping
There will always be new stuff to buy
And I will expand my needs somehow I swear

Now I'm shopping there will always be new stuff to buy
I'm not stopping and I'll expand my needs somehow
And I'll expand me needs somehow I swear

now I'm shopping I'm not stopping (4x)
There will always be new stuff to buy
And I'll expand my needs somehow I swear
