Listen,
I can do anything I want
Because I look good in leather
I can talk any kind of talk
Because I look good in leather

And I know you wish that you could look like me

Listen,
I can make any woman mine
Because I look good in leather
I can rock her body so good it blows her mind
Because I know how to f**k her better
Better than you

Gotcha wishing to be just like me

Yeah
Motherf*cker I'm cool
With attitude and ego to spare

Put on my poker face when I walk the street
Because I look good in leather
I can make a star out of anyone I meet
You're gonna shine if you're standing beside me

Gimme some truth
Don't you wish that you could kick it with me
Kick it with me
Kick it with me
Kick it with me

Because I look good in leather
(Don't you know I)
I look good in leather
(Everybody's lookin')
I look good in leather
(At me I know I)
I look good in leather

And I know that wish you were lookin' like me
And I know that wish you were lookin' like me
And I know that wish you were lookin' like me

Because I look good in leather
(Don't you know I)
I look good in leather
(Everybody's lookin')
I look good in leather
(You see, my body)
Looks good in leather
(Yes I do)
Look good in leather
(Don't you know it don't you)
I look good in leather
(Tell your Mama that I)
Look good in leather
(All the girls know I)
I look good in leather
(Gotta have it my way)
I look good in leather
etc.
