Calm down, she said
Consider this a warning
A souvenir for the morning
A headache that you can't fix

I said, I can talk my
My way out of anything
But I am struggling
In this emergency

This one's on your side
I said this one's on your
Ambulance
I'm calling you now

Accidents
Bring the house down
Come on, come on
You don't know me

Come on, come on
You owe me nothing
Dry your eyes, &
Stick them on ice

Give your chest a rest, it's
Been cold your whole life
I'll have you know the tables
Are about to turn &

You're going to get
What, what, what you
Deserve

Ambulance
I'm calling you now

Accidents
Bring the house down
Come on, come on
You don't know me

Come on, come on
You owe me nothing
& is this it my love?
(Turn it up, turn it up

I want to hear you scream)
Oh, is this it my love?
(Turn it up, turn it up
I want to hear you scream)

So sing, I am my own worst enemy
That's what she said to me
& I am living out your dream
So sing, I am my own worst enemy

So we can just breathe
A little more safely
Ambulance
I'm calling you now

Accidents
Bring the house down
Come on, come on,
You don't know me

Come on, come on
You owe me nothing
& is this it my love?
(Turn it up, turn it up
I want to hear you scream)
Oh, is this it my love?
(Turn it up, turn it up
I want to hear you scream)
Sing
