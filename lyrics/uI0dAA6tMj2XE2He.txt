Don't cry darling, let's try to make up
Please don't push me, i'm over the top
Drown my sorrows we just got to stop
I'll say sorry if you let it drop

Can't understand why you won't take my hand
Out of control and you hurt me so much
Feeling I'm falling, No hope and no warning
Out of control, but I love you so much

Don't say sorry, it's not what you mean
I can't help you, if that's how you feel
I see the storm gathering 'round

Dark clouds that block out the light
Cries in the wind as the nightmare begins
Out of control cause you hurt me so much

Tears in the rain and a storm full of pain
Out of control and i love you so much
Your words are still stinging my eardrums are ringing
All that I want is the joy of your touch

The quaking of hearts as our words fall apart
Out of control but I love you so much

Hold me darling i don't want to fight
Too far, too close i can't get it right
I'm not asking to make it end now

Change has already begun
I'm feeling I'm falling the future is calling
Out of control 'cause you're in such a rush
The sinner, the saint well it's all an adventure
Out of control and I love you so much
Seasons are changing our love's rearranging
All that I want is the joy of your touch
Twisted together my love is forever
Out of control and I love you so much.
