Why give in and apologise, I am fucking done
Don't expect me to fucking budge
There are no words to die for
Head strong with my bullshit
You are too weak to fight me

I'm feeling numb beyond control

I clearly disarmed of all control, All remorse were left behind
Distorting my fucking values, I will never reconcile
The sins are fucking mine to keep, my redemption is there to find
Now watch me fall from grace smiling while Tormented and set ablaze
I succumb to this fucking pain, I count on no one but myself
Living life hanging by a thread, I'm the evil undisguised
Dive into the burning flames is what you ask from me
I'll gladly dive down head first and save my fucking pride
