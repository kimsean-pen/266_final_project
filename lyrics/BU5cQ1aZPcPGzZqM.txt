Why are we here again?
It's the same old sit down roll around chewed up pen
Nothin' thrilling me too much, yeah
Nothin' thrilling me too much, yeah
Nothin' thrilling me too much, yeah
Nothing thrilling me

Yeah, so close now, ooh
Yeah, so close now, ooh

Man, I nearly snapped my twig
Then again I nearly snapped a few of you

So I hear you think highly now
So I hear you think

Yeah, so close now
Yeah, so close now

Why
Why
