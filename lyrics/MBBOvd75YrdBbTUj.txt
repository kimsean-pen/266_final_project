I've been deep down in the dirt for some time
Not a clear song from my heart on my mind
These are words that are clinging on for dear life
But I'm breathing, I'm breathing, I'm breathing

You got body and my knees they go weak
Lie awake and read your sex I can't sleep
I wish I wanted what you want, my everything
But I'm breathing, I'm breathing, I'm breathing

Let me keep it simple, so I don't have to face ya
Let it be just my call, cause I ain't ready for you
Let me keep it simple, so I don't have to face ya
Let it be just my call, cause I ain't ready for you

I ain't ready, I ain't ready, I ain't ready
I ain't ready, I ain't ready, I ain't ready
I ain't ready, I ain't ready, I ain't ready

I go to bed with you and dream about him
You think I want to, no I hate that he wins
Just to forget how fucking broken I am
But I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing

Let me keep it simple, so I don't have to face ya
Let it be just my call, cause I ain't ready for you
Let me keep it simple, so I don't have to face ya
Let it be just my call, cause I ain't ready for you

I ain't ready, I ain't ready, I ain't ready
I ain't ready, I ain't ready, I ain't ready
I ain't ready, I ain't ready, I ain't ready

Let me keep it simple, so I don't have to face ya
Let it be just my call, cause I ain't ready for you
Let me keep it simple, so I don't have to face ya
Let it be just my call, cause I ain't ready for you
