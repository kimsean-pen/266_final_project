She's been running riot
Causing such a scene
Shes been misbehaving
On her hollywood dream

She put too much sugar on her cereal, this morning
Just to get her out of bed
i think ive got the answer,
lay you down with my mellow maramalade

Yellow mellow, yellow mellow
Hello hello, yellow mellow
yellow mellow, yellow mellow
marmalade

Shes been acting crazy
like its snowing all the time
shes been running wild
wouldn't ask her to be my valentine

She put too much sugar on her cereal, this morning
Just to get her out of bed
i think ive got the answer,
lay you down with my mellow maramalade

Yellow mellow, yellow mellow
Hello hello, yellow mellow
yellow mellow, yellow mellow
marmalade
