Hand out the window
Floatin' on air
Just a flip of the wrist
And I'd be wavin' you goodbye
Drive past the lifeguard stand
Where I sit around waiting for you to remember
(As I drive)

How the girls could turn to ghosts before your eyes
And the very dreams that led to them are keeping them from dying (keeping them)
And how the grace with which she walked into your life
Will stay with you in your steps,
And pace with you a while
So long, so long
So long, so long

The speaker in this door is blown
So nothing sounds quite right
(Taking my time
Taking this drive
Waving this town goodbye)
And I drive this ocean road
And remember
(The small of your back,
The nape of your neck
I remember everything)

As I drive,
Oh I'm waving this town goodbye

How the girls can turn to ghosts before your eyes
And the very dreams that led to them are keeping them from dying
And how the grace with which she walked into your life
Will stay with you in your steps,
Pace with you a while
So long, so long
So long, so long
So long, so long

(Taking my time,
Taking this drive
Waving this town goodbye)

And I will leave under the cover
Of summer's kiss upon the sky
Like the stone face of your lover
Just before she says goodbye
I was certain that the season could be held between my arms
But just as summer's hold is fleeting
I was here and now I'm gone
I'm gone...
