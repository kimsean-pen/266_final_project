In offense, the lonely trent
Highway broken, I won't repent
Feeling ahead of his eyes
Gutter we reside

In offense, the lonely trent
Highway broken, I won't repent
Feeling twist right your heart
Get your tongue out of your faces

Are you not irrelevant?
Are you writing at me?
Are you really mad at me?
Are you writing at me?
