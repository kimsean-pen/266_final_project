Yeah, I'm free from your inciting
You can't brainwash me, you've got a problem
Free
Yeah, I'm free from society
You can't control me, I'm a defector

You think, you're strong, and you can't be broken
But your empire is dissolving

But you got it wrong
Look into my eyes, I'm a defector

And your belly is all yellow
You believe, your throne is too high
To be overthrown
Well, watch it get razed by a defector

You can't brainwash me, you've got a problem

Yeah, I'm free from society
You can't control me, I'm a defector

Yeah, I'm free from your inciting
You can't brainwash me, you've got a problem

You can't control me, I'm a defector
