I found your picture hangin' on the back of my door
Won't give you my heart
No one lives there anymore
You said we're lovers
We could never be friends
Fascination ends
Here we go again
'Cause it's hot inside, when you coming home
'Cause it's hot inside, isn't that enough

(chorus)
I'm not in love (repeat)

Could it be that time, has taken it's toll
Won't take you so far, I am in control
You said we're lovers,
We could never be friends
Fascination ends
Here we go again
'Cause it's hot inside, when you coming home
'Cause it's hot inside, isn't that enough

(chorus)
I'm not in love (repeat)
We are not in love (repeat)
