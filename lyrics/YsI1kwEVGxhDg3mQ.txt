I'm not the billionaire class
From San Lorenzo with the trailer trash
I can't afford a fucking thing in sight
Something about this state is just not right
San Francisco, give me your money
Drug-crazed, road-rage, don't ya act funny
I wanna smoke 'till I'm Oakland high
And drop some acid in the Barstow night
Sacramento, marching downtown
Mendecino, beer me down

Cut me open leave me splayed (stitch me back together)
California's bleeding me (blame it on the weather)
Sail me down a river
Temper like a trigger
Take a shot of vodka, blow out my liver
California's bleeding me

Don't give a fuck if I'm banned
The fucking rodents down at Disneyland
Highway 5 down to 99
I'm getting head near the Fresno sign
Berryessa, stumbling and stammered
East Bay Tramps out drinking and hammered
And Hollywood's giving me the bends
Cause in LA you ain't got no friends
Fremont meth-head getting me wired
Start a riot, light a fire

Cut me open leave me splayed (stitch me back together)
California's bleeding me (blame it on the weather)
Sail me down a river
Temper like a trigger
Watch your back, here come the gold diggers
California's bleeding me, and I don't care tonight

We're going west
Like rats we come to infest
We never rest
Feed on the fucking stress

Cut me open leave me splayed... stitch me back together
California's bleeding me (blame it on the weather)
Sail me down a river
Temper like a trigger
Take some shots and blow out my liver
California's bleeding me, and I don't care tonight

And you won't go home
Cause we welcome all
Golden State brings home the gold
