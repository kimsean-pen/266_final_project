Row, row drown everything you know
Row, row let all your filth drown slow
Keep your faith but lose your shape
Don't let your good heart break
Plenty of love for us to take
When we find a land to rape

More to take
More to share
More to break
Let's row

Row, row let you start to get the glow
Don't lose your trust believe in my guts
For a man can only know so much
Birds will land with sandy lips
Open arms with perky tits
They're as sweet as sweet as memories we keep
Keep dreaming
And before you know its purpose will turn away
We'll be alright
We'll be afraid

The stars shine
They show us more than black
Show us more than we left behind
And we ain't going back
We're gone strong can't go wrong
Keep rowing and it won't be long
Keep rowing to the beat in your heart
And row
Just row

Row, row drown everything you know
Row, row let all your filth drown slow
Keep your faith and lose your shape
Don't let your good heart break
Plenty of love for us to take
When we find a land to rape

More to take
More to share
More to break
Let's row

We gonna find us a new timeline
We gonna leave everything behind
We gonna find us a new timeline
We gonna leave everything behind
We gonna find us a new timeline
We gonna leave everything behind
We gonna find us a new timeline
We gonna leave everything behind
