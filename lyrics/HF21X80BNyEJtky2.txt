Jimmy Brown, made of stone
Charlie clown, no way home
Bring on the dancing horses
Headless and all alone
Shiver and say the words
Of every lie you've heard

First I'm gonna make it
Then I'm gonna break it
Till it falls apart
Hating all the faking
And shaking while I'm breaking
Your brittle heart

Billy stands all alone
Sinking sand, skin and bone
Bring on the dancing horses
Wherever they may roam
Shiver and say the words
Of every lie you've heard

First I'm gonna make it
Then I'm gonna break it
Till it falls apart
Hating all the faking
And shaking while I'm breaking
Your brittle heart

Brittle heart, brittle heart
Brittle heart and my little heart goes

Jimmy Brown, made of stone
Charlie Clown, no way home
Bring on the headless horses
Wherever they may roam
Shiver and say the words
Of every lie you've heard

First I'm gonna make it
Then I'm gonna break it
Till it falls apart
Hating all the faking
And shaking while you're breaking
My brittle heart

Brittle heart, brittle heart
And our little heart goes

Bring on the new Messiah
Wherever he may roam
Bring on the new Messiah
Wherever he may roam

Bring on the new Messiah
Wherever he may roam
Bring on the new Messiah
Wherever he may roam
