Somewhere in the country
There's a place where nobody knows your name
When I'm feeling lonely
There's a train that helps me run away

I know my mother
She always told me
The road would get cold
I never listened
Always forgettin'
The way back home
The way back home

Somewhere in the city
There's a face that makes it hard to stay
He never listened to me
When I'd say that things would never change

I know my mother
She always told me
The road would get cold
I never listened
Always forgettin'
The way back home
The way back home
The way back home

I know my mother
She always told me
The road would get cold
I never listened
Always forgettin'
The way back home

I never listened
Always forgettin'
The way back home
The way back home
