So quick to judge, so easily we forget,
What it's like to be dissected
Where feelings are tossed aside
Like a drug it feeds the imagination of minds that go Unparalyzed
Followers to the leaders of mass hypnotic corruption
That live their lives only to criticize
Where is the invisible line that we must draw to create Individual thought
Patterns

Prisoners of mental deception be free within singular Judgement
Twisting words to control the masses
To cover up one's self insecurities
Like a drug it feeds the imagination of minds that go Unparalyzed
Followers to the leaders of mass hypnotic corruption
That live their lives only to criticize
Where is the invisible line that we must draw to create Individual thought
