In the street and I'm like drifting like a GT-R
I don't speak at all, guess we need to talk
Barb wire and alarms all around the yard
The city's never dark but I'm seeing stars
Walking at the mall, scarlet Louboutins
I got Louis Vuitton and it's free of charge
Platinum Visa card, drinking rubicon
Christian Dior charms with some rubieson

They ask me bout my wealth and where I got it from
I'm like,"oh my god, I'm gonna lose my calm,"
Everything you know and love can soon be gone
If I don't get involved, then you can't do me wrong
Bleeding from my palms, dripping down my arms
I didn't mean you harm, I had a change of heart
Thought your life was hard, that was the easy part
If I say I love you, will you play along?
Bleeding from my palms like The Passion
Tracksuit bottoms and they sagging
Drinking crushed ice mixed with vanish
And it made me disappear like magic
In the wonderland, feel like Alice (like Alison)
I'm thinking let's go do some damage (let's go damage them)
I got plastic bags full of acid (tastes like medicine)
Whatever happens, happens

In the street and I'm like drifting like a GT-R
I don't speak at all, guess we need to talk
Barb wire and alarms, all around the yard
The city's never dark but I'm seeing stars
Walking at the mall, spotted Louboutins
I got Louis Vuitton and it's free of charge
Platinum Visa card, drinking rubicon
Christian Dior charms with some rubies on
