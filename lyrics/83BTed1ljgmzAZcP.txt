If I walk away
Then who's gonna carry your home
If I walk away
Then who's gonna carry your home

We may have had a bit too much
But no one has to know
But if I walk away
Then who's gonna carry you home
Oh, carry you home

Well we came here for the weekend
It was your friend's idea
It started as just a few of us
Now everybody's here
You took my hand and told me Dan
"I'm not really one for crowds"
And you took off out the window
As fast a legs allowed
I thought if we just slowed down
We might start making sense

If I walk away
Then who's gonna carry your home
If I walk away
Then who's gonna carry your home

Well we may have had a bit too much
But no one has to know
But if I walk away
Then who's gonna carry you home
Oh, carry you home

So you shivered under covers
In the tail end of the summer
A certain sick, no medicine could tame
And we were just kids
That's the hardest part
The things we build
Just to rip them apart
Oh you ripped me apart
I thought if we just slowed down
We might start making sense

If I walk away
Then who's gonna carry your home
If I walk away
Then who's gonna carry your home

Well I came here with my baby
I'm not leaving here alone
But if I walk away
Then who's gonna carry you home
Oh, carry you home
