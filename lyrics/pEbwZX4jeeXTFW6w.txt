Aye
You must of thought I've forgotten, uh
I've been the demon you're talking to
Better be moving with caution, uh
I'm still the psycho who lost it, yeah
They made me sick and
I'm sticking my foot down
But foolish enough to
Reach out when I'm lowest
A criminal, as I decide to invert
Ahh, shut your fucking mouth
Leave me in peace
Think I figured bullshit
I'ma pick it up and win
Never relaxed
Focused and trying for greed
Let them all fall with the place
Ahh, let them roll and then rot
They don't fucking deserve it

You make me sick
You make me sick (You make me sick)
You make me sick (You make me sick)

You make me sick (Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick)
Sick (Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick)

Let me live my life
I got demons in my mind
Most of you niggas lack a spine
All them feelings, they alive (Yeah)
I see the weapon that kills, uh
Money is part of my fuels, uh
I live my gin life
From those that owed my dues
For my eyes
Thank you for drowning the bills
Like I made them perceive
That they're catching my pro nigga
Feeling no pressure
I'll just dive on this jet
I'm not rocking no ice
I go step on the plan
Really in it for the long run
Niggas never sit still (What?)
I'm just speeding cause I want more
I'm on my own

You make me sick
You make me sick
You make me sick
You make me sick (What)
You make me sick
(Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick)
Sick (Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick)

You make me sick
