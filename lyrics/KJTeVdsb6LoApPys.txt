A hopeless romantic, self-medicated on reality
A misunderstanding is all that anyone can see in me

Pulling up the floor to go deeper down
Tearing at the soil to find the ground

I'm trying to find myself
Coming back to the same words to try to tell a different story
I'm farther from myself
Coming back to the same words, in hope they come alive without me
(Without me!)

A moment's reflection has given me a second chance to heal
A loss of connection in matching up my words to how I feel

Pulling up the floor to go deeper down
Tearing at the soil to find the ground

I'm trying to find myself
Coming back to the same words to try to tell a different story
I'm farther from myself
Coming back to the same words, in hope they come alive without me

I've taken on too much, empty pages on the floor
Tearing volumes from the shelf to find what I've been looking for
Then it hit me

Well, I haven't changed
I'm still the same man I was before

Well, I haven't changed, I'm still the same man I was
Just trying to find myself
Coming back to the same words to try to tell a different story
I'm farther from myself
Coming back to the same words, in hope they come alive without me

I'm farther from myself, coming back to the same words
I'm trying to find myself, coming back to the same words
