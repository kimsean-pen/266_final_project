Keeping up replies when I'm on the road
Speak to me in rhymes speak to me in code
What have you done to me lately my dear?
If you're still a friend let me know

Staying up all night with my ball and chain
All the bridges burst into yellow flame
Winning and losing and pushing away
If I fell apart would you stay?

In a place riddled with liars and fools
You are now taking your heart [???]
All along I was wrong I was wrong im.
Moving on with or with (you)

Cymbals shake my ears in the dead of night
Smoke and mirror clubs with revolving lights
Keeping good company let it all go
When I'm finally home I'll let you know

I was wrong, now I was wrong, no I was wrong
I was wrong, no I was wrong
