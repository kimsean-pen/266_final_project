My heart
Is sad and lonely
For you I sigh
For you dear only
Why haven't you
Seen it?
I'm all for you
Body and soul

I spend my days
In longing
And wondering why
It's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you
Body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd
Turn away romance
Are you pretending?
Looks like the ending
Unless I could have
One more chance to prove
Dear
My life's a wreck
You're making
You know that I'm yours
For just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Body and soul
