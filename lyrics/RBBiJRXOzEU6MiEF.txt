In a small ghost town, there's a little arcade,
where the poltergeists play their video games.
(On the roof he says...)
Game over they said,
Game over they said run and get your quarters in.
(Over cliffs we will swim ahead.)

Do the shackles underneath your bed
haunt the records in their grooves?

(And he said inside of them...)
Salem is home
Sentenced to live.
Yes, this I know
Comes back tenfold, fold, fold.

Run and get your quarters in.

At the bottom of a french blue pool,
Roamed the drunk chipped tooth
Of the man in the moon.
(Jump on the roof he said.)
Burn, furnace burn
At the bottom of the cliff,
Shined a diamond with no end to its trip.

Do the shackles underneath your bed
haunt the records in their grooves?

(And they said it's all over.)
Salem is home
Sentenced to live.
Yes, this i know
Comes back tenfold, fold, fold.

Hook and sinker.
(x3)

I wrote it all down for you.
Match a name to the face.
Do you suspect?
Do you confess?
Do you confess?

Salem is home
Sentenced to live.
Yes, this i know
Comes back tenfold, fold, fold.
