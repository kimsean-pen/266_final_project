Hopeless, just a kid with a craving
To make memories with my father
It's taken a lifetime to chase 'em
That's why I seem to reserve this space in my head
For the grudges of all the nights you didn't tuck us into bed
Never showing up to my games
Never taking us to arcades
Seems like nothing has changed
When you don't show up for my shows
But straight up wait till the day of
To tell me that you can't make it
So I hit the stage and it's raining
I'm a man no thanks to you Dad

You're so quick to move on
What about the ones you left behind
How am I supposed to be strong
When you're the weak one

I've had so much I could say to you
But you'll never get the chance to know me
It's all I've ever asked for
I've had this craving to be close to you
But you'll never get the chance to know me
It's all I've asked for

Selfless, a mother who wouldn't eat
Just so we could have the money to keep up the same routines
She got a new job, and a new house, and a new life, and a new love
So next time you call we probably won't pick up no

I see visions of a perfect family
And what the fuck that even means
Then I see the way you sacrifice
Everything for everyone except me

You're so quick to move on
What about the ones you left behind
How am I supposed to be strong
You're the weak one

I've had so much I could say to you
But you'll never get the chance to know me
It's all I've ever asked for
I've had this craving to be close to you
But you'll never get the chance to know me
It's all I've asked for

Tell me bout how
You're so damn proud
I know you love me
But you gotta leave now
Nah, you don't care about us
Tell me how the hell you sleep at night
I hope your new life is worth the sacrifice
You don't care bout us
But I know someone who does
I know someone who does

I have so much I could say to you
But you'll never get the chance to know me
It's all I've ever asked for
I've had this craving to be close to you
But you'll never get the chance to know me
It's all I've asked for
