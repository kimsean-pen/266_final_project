they still look at you like a lost battalion
calling on all downs that you once made home
my apologies to your lost battalion
they still look at you like your loss is so great

sha la la
let's go let's go

soft soft silver bang like a banks hydraulics
the air it hangs its head and your cat has passed out
you polished off your thoughts in the banks hydraulics
soft soft silver bang when the vaults are all shut

sha la la
let's go let's go
down so let down and down again
the doubt it takes you down another step
down you feel so down that all you think
sha la la

here comes everybody from the outside
they all want the same things that you hate
turn your face back on and crack a smile
here comes everybody you never cared for

sha la la
let's go let's go
down so let down and down again
the doubt it takes you down another step
your only alibi comes just like
sha la la sha la la

let's go let's go

they won't be happy for you.
