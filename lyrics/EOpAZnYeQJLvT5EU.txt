It fell from the heavens and brought with it blight
Contaminating the soil, feeding on fauna and flora alike
But this glowing meteorite was but a harbinger for something worse
For within was a womb of pure chaos that gave birth to this curse

Withering on the vine
Flourishing with decay

The corruption spreads across these lands
Black roots writhe in the earth below
A graying harvest falls to waste
Unhallowed radiance gleams from sickened oak

Suffocated by maddening vapors
Gestating in underground chambers

Formless, a monstrous constellation
That which consumes all things into its toothless maw
Amorphous, ghoulish miasma
Devouring all lifeforms within its vaporous jaws

(Solo: Davidson)

Churning clouds of chaos
A living maelstrom
Not of this world
Born from the backwards beyond
