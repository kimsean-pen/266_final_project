A break in the pattern of your heartbeat
A moment of silence but a noise that deafens ears
And there was nothing they could do to try and keep you
How do you tell the family? How do you break the news?

In the end we say goodbye to all of our friends
Goodbye to all of our friends, we say goodbye

And the heartbreak was followed by court dates
But there was a mistake it didn't work
Because a system made by men, is a system made of dirt
No mothers dream of how her son's name makes the paper
No explanation or proper reason to say goodbye

It's such a goddamn shame

In the end we say goodbye to all of our friends
Goodbye to all of our friends, we say goodbye
In the end we say goodbye to all of our friends
Goodbye to all of our friends, we say goodbye

It's such a goddamn shame
A broken system stays
It's such a goddamn shame

In the end we say goodbye to all of our friends
Goodbye to all of our friends, we say goodbye

In the end we say goodbye to all of our friends
Goodbye to all of our friends, we say goodbye
In the end we say goodbye to all of our friends
Goodbye to all of our friends, we say goodbye
In the end we say goodbye to all of our friends
Goodbye to all of our friends, we say goodbye
