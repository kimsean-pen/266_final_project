This twitch in my fingers
Love, hate it lingers
Sent it direct, but the point must have missed her
Gave up and lost, cause of timing and pressure
And now I'm gone

Lie alone
it's all you can do now
And hear me drone
About the things I can't change
Lie alone
it's all you can do now
And hear me, hear me drone on my own

What has this come to?
I know you don't see me as much you ought to
And both wounds are bleeding out
Grace me with nothing but patience
I'll admit that I hate this if there's no other way out

Lie alone
it's all you can do now
And hear me drone
About the things I can't change
Lie alone
it's all you can do now
And hear me, hear me drone on my own

On the outs with everything
The calm and talk you seldom bring
On the outs with everything
The calm and talk you seldom bring
On the outs with everything
The calm and talk you seldom bring

Lie alone
it's all you can do now
And hear me drone
About the things I can't change
Lie alone
it's all you can do now
And hear me, hear me drone on my own
