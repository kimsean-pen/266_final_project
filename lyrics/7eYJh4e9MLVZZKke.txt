I know they don't like what we're up to
(I'll hold you down, you come right now, it's all for you)
They don't see what we've got like we do
(Don't hate on how we run around they don't have a clue)
And all I know, when it's time to go
Is that all I need, is for you to leave with me, leave with me

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Want to pick you up
And all night I've been waiting
Then we hop up in my truck
We roll out and we're racing

Our time really ain't enough
And you know how I'm impatient
I'll make you feel brand new, just give me all of you
And I don't know if this is love

But our hearts ain't for playing
But I can't get enough
I'm talking crazy I'm just saying
I just hope this ain't too much
But what we got here is amazing
I'll make you feel brand new, just give me all of you

Baby let's just take control tonight
(I'm in your zone, so take me home, the time is right)
All that time of mine that I put in

(They ask me why I can't deny it's all for you)
And all I know, when it's time to go
Is that all I need, is for you to leave with me, leave with me
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Want to pick you up
And all night I've been waiting
Then we hop up in my truck

We roll out and we're racing
Our time really ain't enough
And you know how I'm impatient
I'll make you feel brand new, just give me all of you
And I don't know if this is love
But our hearts ain't for playing

But I can't get enough
I'm talking crazy I'm just saying
I just hope this ain't too much
But what we got here is amazing
I'll make you feel brand new, just give me all of you

Just give me all of you
Just give me, just give me, just give me all of you
