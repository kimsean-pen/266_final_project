In the shadows
Buried in me lies a child's toy
In the shadows
The name is unknown to me

In the shadows
Gray crusaders with tails mother made
In the shadows
Will to become their pride, why?

In the shadows
I climbed mountain for chairs don't look down
Try this figure out
Memorize their words for hope

In the shadows
Stood up high for all to see
In the shadows
Counting these numbers down, down

No one can take away
Leaf falls short
Dreams over lie's the same
If I may weep

In the shadows
Buried in me lies a child's toy
Tried to figure out
Memorize their words for hope

In the shadows
Stood up high for all to see me
In the shadows
Counting these numbers down, down

No one can take away
Leaf falls short
Dreams over lie's the same
If I may weep, weep
