Just say, say it ain't so;
This is not the home that I know;
I never thought I'd let you down,
Never thought I'd let you down;
You promised - promised not to let me drown;

In my daydreams, you take over me;
In these daydreams, you take over me!

Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel my limbs again?
Is this all in my mind?

Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel that way again?
Am I losing my mind?

No way - it's not the same;
This place has had its way;
I swore to never let you down,
I never thought I'd let you down;
I'm sorry - I'm sorry that I let you drown;

In my daydreams, you take over me;
In these daydreams, you take over me!

Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel my limbs again?
Is this all in my mind?

Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel that way again?
Am I losing my mind?
Am I losing my mind?

(Something's always pulling me underground)

Is there something staring back at me?
Is there something waiting there for me?
But there never really was...
No, there never really was...
And there never really was...

Will my daydreams take over me?
Will these daydreams take over me?

Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel my limbs again?
Is this all in my mind?

Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel that way again?
Am I losing my mind?

(Something's always pulling me under...)

Open your eyes, tell me why.
Open your eyes, you shall see it.
Open your eyes, tell me why.
Open your eyes, you still sleep with it.
Open your eyes. (x6)
