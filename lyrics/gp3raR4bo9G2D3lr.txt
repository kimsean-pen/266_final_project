One voice says to like the pain
Of being next to you
The other likes to fuck my brain
Tells me to run from you

So help me, help me, have you seen
My mental stability
I think I need a pill to keep my sanity
Don't wanna be an addict
But I'm feeling so
Schizophrenic

One voice says there's more to life
Than being stuck with you
The other knows I'd die tonight
If I'm not close to you

So help me, help me, have you seen
My mental stability
I think I need a pill to keep my sanity
Don't wanna be an addict
But I'm feeling so
Schizophrenic

Medicate me and sedate me
Chain me to bed
Medicate me and sedate me
Turn off my head
Medicate me and sedate me
Chain me to bed
Medicate me and sedate me
Turn off my head

So help me, help me, have you seen
My mental stability
I think I need a pill to keep my sanity
Don't wanna be an addict
But I'm feeling so
Schizophrenic

Medicate me and sedate me
Chain me to bed
Medicate me and sedate me
Turn off my head
Medicate me and sedate me
Chain me to bed
Medicate me and sedate me
Turn off my head
