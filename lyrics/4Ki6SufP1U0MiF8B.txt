Spatial awareness, so much confusion
And it's so difficult to harness
But then I look at you, nimble and righteous
And then I look at the floor
We made a fine mess

My kiss, can you feel it yet?
In the back of your legs
And underneath of your neck

Are you a temple? Are you temptress?
There is too much choice
The possibilities are endless
So wash away my sands
Give me catharsis
You remagnetized my moral compass

My kiss, can you feel it yet?
In the back of your legs
And underneath of your neck
Your touch, I cannot regret
I love the shape of your mouth
And the back of your head

You are so my kind
Erotic and divine
I got to testify
To have you purified

To me you're more than a human
You are more complex
You're like a fallen angel
Who uses god as a hex

My kiss, can you feel it yet?
In the back of your legs
And underneath of your neck
Your touch, well I cannot regret
I love the shape of your mouth
And the back of your head

You are so my kind
Erotic and divine
I got to testify
To have you purified
