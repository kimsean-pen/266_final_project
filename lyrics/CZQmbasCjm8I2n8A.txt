I could see you ten or twelve times a day
I think it's best we do it your therapist's way
I grow my hair long and wear big coats, yeah
I get so lovesick my sad thoughts float
Time, you've got me running
News broke today so we're not talking
I think it's best we do a little bit of stopping
I want a house on a beach and you in my dreams
I need water, yeah, and a love, love, love, love
Time, you've got me running
Time, you've got me tired
Well I've got more for the world than this
(I've got more)
I've got love that I need to give
(I've got more)
And I've got more for the world than this
(I've got more)
And I've got love that I need to give
(Ahhhhh)
