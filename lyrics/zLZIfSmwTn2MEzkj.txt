I don't understand what I've done to deserve this
Please explain it to me
Beaten and broken, thrown out with the garbage
No-one looking out for me
I'll be just fine, I have what it takes when I have to survive
Just tell me why
Do you decide my right to life?

At the end of the day
With the wind in my face

My life goes on and on and on and on
Now I can feel something
All the hurt I felt is gone
There's nothing you can do to me!

Crushed under the weight
Of a world that's left us behind
I'm done defending
Just because I'm loyal doesn't mean you own me

I was nothing to no-one
I was worthless and so on
One glance made you sick
God did nothing so he doesn't exist

I was nothing to no-one
Fucking worthless and so on
So young, so fucked, so numb
You'll see there's nothin' you can do to me!

At the end of the day
With the wind in my face

My life goes on and on and on and on
Now I can feel something
All the hurt I felt is gone
There's nothing you can do to me!

On and on and on and on
Now I can feel something
All the hurt I felt is gone
There's nothing you can do to me!

Now I know where I belong
I have a place to call home
I have been alone so long
There's nothing you can do to me!
There's nothing you can do to me!
There's nothing you can do to me!
There's nothing you can do to me!
There's nothing you can do to me!
