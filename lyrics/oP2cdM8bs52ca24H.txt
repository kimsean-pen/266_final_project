I Lost Myself
When I Looked In Your Eyes
I Tried To Disguise Myself
Fear Inside
Fear Inside My Love
The Suffering
Moved And Breathed
Our Hands Silhouettes
Against The Sky
Against The Sky Our Love
Where Were You
Hope To Chain This Memory
We Could Have Been The Last Time
Show Me A Sight In The Side Of Chance
Hold Tomorrow
One Foot In And One Foot Out
Are You Strong Enough
Are You Strong Enough
Pitiful Boy
I Lost Myself
In Your Embrace
I Saw The Lie Come Clear
Fear Inside
Fear Inside Our Love
Farther Now
Run Away
Try To Reveal Myself
Fear Inside
The Loss Remains
Where Were You
Hope To Chain This Memory
We Chould Have Been Last Time
Show Me A Sight In The Side Of Chance
Hold Tomorrow
One Foot In And One Foot Out
Are You Strong Enough
Are You Strong Enough
Pitiful Boy!
