Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high

If I had a day that I could give you
I would give a day sure to make you smile

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine almost always makes me high

If I had a day that I could give you
I would give you a day just like today
And if I had a song that I could sing for you
I would sing a song to make you feel this way, ooh

Sunshine, ooh, sunshine
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine almost always makes me high
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine almost always makes me high
