I looked in the sky
Where an elephant's eye
Was looking at me
From a bubblegum tree
And all that I knew was
The hole in my shoe
Which was letting in water (letting in water)

I walked through a field
That just wasn't reall
with 100 tin soldiers
Which stood at my shoulder
And all that I knew was
The hole in my shoe
Which was letting in water (letting in water)

(I climbed on the back of a giant albatross
Which flew through a crack in the cloud
To a place where happiness reigned all year round
And music played ever so loudly)

I started to fall
And suddenly woke
And the dew on the grass
had soaked through my coat
And all that I knew was
The hole in my shoe
Which was letting in water (letting in water)
