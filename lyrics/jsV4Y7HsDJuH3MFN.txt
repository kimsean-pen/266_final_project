We're on an open bed truck on the highway
Rain is coming down and we're on the run
Think I can feel the breath in your body
We gotta keep on running 'til we see the sun

Oh you gotta fire and it's burnin' in the rain
Thought that it went out, but it's burnin' just the same
And you don't look back, not for anything
'Cause you love someone, you love them all the same
If you love someone, you love 'em all the same

Oh, I feel your heartbeat
And oh, you're comin' around, comin' around, comin' around
If you can love somebody, you love them all the same
You gotta love somebody, love 'em all the same
I'm singing, oh, I'm feeling your heartbeat

I'm tryin' to put it all back together
I've got a story and I'm tryin' to tell it right
I've got the kerosene and the desire
I'm tryin' to start a flame in the heart of the night

Oh you gotta fire and it's burnin' in the rain
Thought that it went out, but it's burnin' just the same
And you don't look back, not for anything
'Cause you love someone, you love them all the same
If you love someone, you love 'em all the same

Oh, I feel your heartbeat
And oh, you're comin' around, comin' around, comin' around
If you can love somebody, love 'em all the same
You gotta love somebody, love 'em all the same
I'm singing, oh, I feel your heartbeat

I know the memories rushin' into your mind
I want to kiss your scars tonight
I'm laying here
'Cause you've gotta try, you've gotta let me in, let me in

Oh, I feel your heartbeat
And oh, you're comin' around, comin' around, comin' around
You gotta love somebody, you gotta, you gotta love somebody
You gotta, I'm singing, oh, I feel your heartbeat

Oh, your heartbeat
Yeah, I said
Oh, your heartbeat, yeah
Oh, your heartbeat
