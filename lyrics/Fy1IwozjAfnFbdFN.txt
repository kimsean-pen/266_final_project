Good you came to celebrate with us.
...
Fall and sway. Bring the bill.
I'll answer don't worry.
...
On my way with gifts I save.

Now, you're feeling bitterly
no one will put you down
you've gotta head up, head up.
Stop thinking on me now.
I wanna find out how
and I don't need to hide
Say save us for last?
I'm feeling terrified.
