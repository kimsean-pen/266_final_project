You ask me,
Why it is I come to you,
When someone else is just as good.
I asked them but they said the same,
Didn't even ask my name.

Explain to me,
Just what it is you have to lose.
Take a minute in my shoes,
Don't it feel like you've paid your dues
Already.

I'll show you,
That all our fates are so entwined.
Don't lose your faith in humankind.
Just don't forget my state of mind
Is fragile.

Together,
We can enjoy the taste of dignity.
As long as you believe in me,
I'll show you my reality,
I've seen a few.

You ask me,
Why it is I come to you,
When someone else is just as good.
I asked them but they said the same,
Didn't even ask my name.
