I've just seen a ghost
The memories I hate the most
Reflections I feel
Were something I forgot were real
A little view of the past
I promise all of this is not gonna last
Trust me, I know
Ya no quiero que llores
The universe is gonna give you muchas flores
Quítate ese miedo
You'll be a lot more trust me, yo te entiendo
Mama I apologize
I'm not what you thought in your mind
But I promise I'll be
Worth all the love that you gave me
Ambar you will make it far
All of the wishes that you begged from the star
They will come true
Ya no quiero que llores
The universe is gonna give you muchas flores
Quítate ese miedo
You'll be a lot more trust me, yo te entiendo
I know times are hard right now
But I promise you'll be alright
I know times are hard right now
But I promise you'll be alright
Ya no quiero que llores
The universe is gonna give you muchas flores
Quítate ese miedo
You'll be a lot more trust me, yo te entiendo
