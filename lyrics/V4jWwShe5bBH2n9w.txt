And now the sun is rising
Now the long walk back home (back home)
There's just so many faces
But no one I need to know (need to know)

In the dark
I can't fight it
I fake 'til I'm numb
But in the bright light
I taste you on my tongue

Now the party's over
And everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken
Like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter?
Or am I just hung over you?
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Or am I just hungover?

Even my dirty laundry
Everything just smells like you (like you)
And now my head is throbbing
Every song is out of tune
Just like you

In the dark
I can't fight 'til it disapears
But in the daylight
I taste you in my tears

Now the party's over
And everybodys gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken
Like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter?
Or am I just hung over you?

Now I've got myself looking like a mess
Standing alone trying to pretend but no
I put up my fight
But this is it this time (time)
'Cause I'm here in the end, tryin' to pretend
Here in the end, tryin' to pretend
oh, ohhh

And now the party's over
And everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken
Like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter?
Or am I just hung over you?

Now the party's over
And everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken
Like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter?
Or am I just hung over you?

Ah ah ah
Or am I just hungover?
