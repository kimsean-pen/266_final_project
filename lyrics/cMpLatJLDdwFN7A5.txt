What's that?
Wanna go back to sleep...

When I hear that alarm clock ring (wake up!)
That's my cue to enter
I've finished counting my 40 winks (all done!)
And then I remember
There's so much stuff to do
Right now I just wanna snooze because
Waking up is the hardest part (uh-huh)
But then, it's essential

Get up, get up! What's that in the sky?
Could it be? It's KKB!
パワーアップして戻ってきたぜ
無敵のヒーロ、それがボニト
Rise and shine, it's party time
Eat your breakfast, and you'll be fine
Everybody, エンジンスタート
ケロケロワールドへご招待

苦手な早起き
でもわいてくるよ、やる気
始まる一日
波に乗りたい (yo yo yo yo yo yo)
Back in the place, I'm looking great
Bet you can't tell I'm half awake
Living my way, no day is the same
But sometimes I'm a bit late

When I hear that alarm clock ring (wake up!)
That's my cue to enter
I've finished counting my 40 winks (all done!)
And then I remember
There's so much stuff to do
Right now I just wanna snooze because
Waking up is the hardest part (uh-huh)
But then, it's essential

3, 2, 1, lift-off, infinity
Let's go on a Kero Kero journey
Get on the bus and hold on tight
スピードマックス going so high
世界のみんなへ届ける
International 楽しい sound
僕たち３人ビートにのせて
But then I wonder, is it all a dream?

Whoaaaaaa
