I've said it once and I'll say it again,
We are unparalleled, we have no friends.
Sick and tired of all the imposters,
I am done with try'na pretend.

This is a warning shot, Judas.
We see through your cowardice.
Have you all lost the plot? Brutus.
Rendering you powerless,
Herod.
Untouchable and dangerous,
A decade at the top, Traitor.
Unflattered by your poor imitation.

Silence, all that oppose us,
We are the idols, bow in the presence of kings.
Realised all your dreams,
Unstoppable, infallible on your knees.
We laugh in the face of the critics,
Our success so mephitic.
How can we be arrogant?
Accolades so evident, bow in the presence of gods.

Bow, in the presence of gods.

All your eyes are coloured green,
Way above your petty scene.
We do not care if you get it,
Play from our hearts, don't you ever forget it.
We do it all and we do it correct,
This is pain 101 show some fucking respect.
DML ADC, we hold the master key,
Infinity is the length of our legacy.

We laugh in the face of critics,
Our success so mephitic.
How can we be arrogant?
Accolades so evident, bow in the presence of gods.

Jaded posers who say we're not true,
Our gift reserved for the real slam crew.
Poor choices, rookie mistakes.
Bored with the bullshit, we won't fuck with the fakes.
Hardest cunts, slamming right in your face.
Bring more contenders, for us to erase.

Make a fool of us? No.

We can't stab your back if it's against the wall.
We don't do betrayal cos we've got it all.
Five brothers who will never fall.
We rewrote the game, and yet you've made us crawl.

Poor choices, rookie mistakes.
Bored with the bullshit, we won't fuck with the fakes.

Bring more contenders, we will erase.

Vermin,
Beaten broke but we're determined,
You can't fuck with us.
Your shallow legacy will come to an end,
Reborn as gods now it's time to ascend.

Flawless.
