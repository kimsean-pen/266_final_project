Babe, don't make a sound
2 a.m. love gotta keep it down (keep it down)
Don't wait around for a signal now
Gimme some verbs, I ain't talking nouns (I'm naughty)
You wanna ride in the 6
You wanna dine in The Six (dine in The Six)
But when I lean for the kiss
You said I'll probably send you some pics
And I'm like

Hell nah, been waiting too long (I've been waiting)
Hell nah, I want that crew love (don't leave, baby)
Hell nah, been waiting too long (I've been waiting)
Hell nah, I want that crew love

Body on my, losing all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grinding on my innocence, yeah
Body on my, losing all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grinding on my innocence, yeah

Body on my, losing all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grinding on my innocence, yeah
Body on my, losing all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grinding on my innocence, yeah

On my, on my, on my, on my innocence, yeah
On my, on my, on my, on my innocence, yeah
On my, on my, on my, on my innocence, yeah

Babe, just hit the pedal
If things going wrong it's just incidental
My bad, never got the memo
But you never have fun while you're in the limo, yeah
If you wanna ride in the 6
You wanna dine in The Six (dine in The Six)
But when I lean for the kiss
You said I'll probably send you some pics
And I'm like

Hell nah, been waiting too long (I've been waiting)
Hell nah, I want that crew love (don't leave, baby)
Hell nah, been waiting too long (I've been waiting)
Hell nah, I want that crew love

Body on my, losing all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grinding on my innocence, yeah
Body on my, losing all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grinding on my innocence, yeah

Body on my, losing all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grinding on my innocence, yeah

On my, on my, on my, on my innocence, yeah
On my, on my, on my, on my innocence, yeah
