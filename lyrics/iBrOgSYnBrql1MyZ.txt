I occupy these feet with these dead arms and these dead legs
The brambles catch and tighten and they pull me into bed
This is no retaliation - this is the universe
I imagine myself walking here 5 million years before...
I'm so intrigued by this one - it's sharp around the sides
There's a danger to your loving, and my loves been compromised

I have been out walking with these Dead Arms & Dead Legs
And the mysteries of the universe are patterned in my head
The terrain becomes unbearable - too steep to stick your heel
I imagine myself here again in 50 million years

I run to the left... I run to the right
And all my fears become a life
And what is left... and who are you in the end?

I demonstrate my actions in the grace of your defeat
And all things that were left unsaid internally repeat
And the pain becomes tyrannical - 400 tonnes of shame
As I walk into a perfect storm again
I take the burden on myself

I run to the left... I run to the right
And all my fears become a life
And what is left... and who are you in the end?

I've entertained their feeling maybe once but never twice
And you feel the world is ending, nothing else can suffice
If it fills that void you bear, if that something wasn't free
How can I begin to blame you, you are the prisoner in me?

So I run to the left... I run to the right
And all my fears are so alive
And what is left... and who are you in the end?
I run to the left... I run to the right
And all my fears are so alive
And what is left... and who are we in the end?
