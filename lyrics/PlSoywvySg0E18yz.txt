Talk about our lives so great for a change
You're normally so down
Want to come out again
Such a shame
Last time you last so soon
I tried showing up, never out for life to lead
Tried to represent all the things I don't need
That you were after, that you were after

Now there's not a shoulder cold enough for me to give her
There's not a shoulder cold enough for me to give her
There's not a shoulder cold enough for me to give her

Find the reasons to live
On a grid there's no shortcuts in New York
I see you in this kids
So worth the trouble

Life go the way I say I was never meant to live
You're not going home tonight
Neither am I
Neither am I

Now there's not a shoulder cold enough for me to give her
There's not a shoulder cold enough for me to give her
There's not a shoulder cold enough for me to give her
There's not a shoulder cold enough for me to give her
There's not a shoulder cold enough for me to give her
