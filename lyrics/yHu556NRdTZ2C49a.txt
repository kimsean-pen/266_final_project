Long ago
We're not so far away
This is a piece
Of something I've made

You can't sell
Or you can't trade
But people just take and take and take

I'm not crying anymore
I'm keeping you
I'm not wishing anymore
I'm keeping you

Memories
In fallout way
Promises
Of a big mistake

Temples
Bring night and day
And me, I almost escaped that all the way

I'm not crying anymore
I'm keeping you
I'm not wishing anymore
I'm keeping you

Trying to remember
Recapture
Senses say
November

I'm keeping you
