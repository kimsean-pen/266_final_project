I want you
Though you dare to deny it
I'm always reminded of you
And the more you forbid me
The more I need you to give me

Morning comes upon us
To impose another day
Though I might try to force myself to sleep
Why should I
Face up to
Another waking day
When there's a chance you'll come to me
In dreams
The world just keeps
Right on
Turning anyway
While I stay home and watch the shadow play
Innocence is lost into the dark
If I were dynamite would you provide the spark?

I want you
Though you dare to deny it
I am always reminded of you
And the more you forbid me
The more I need you to give me
I don't know what to do
If you dare to deny it
I'm always reminded of you
And the more you forbid me
The more I need you to give me

If only you could see my life
Turning inside out
A heart that keeps attacking me
Always in my mouth
And if my skin were glass my love
You would see a heart that keeps on beating
Only in the hope that you'll return, to me

I don't know what to do
Though you dare to deny it
I'm always reminded of you
And the more you forbid me
The more I need you to give me

I want you
Though you dare to deny it
I am always reminded of you
And the more you forbid me
The more I need you to give me
I don't know what to do
Though you dare to deny it
I'm always reminded of you
And the more you forbid me
The more I need you to give me

I want you
I am always reminded of you
I want you
Always reminded of you
Reminded of you
Always reminded of you
