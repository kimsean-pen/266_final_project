If we could only be in different places
Among the same faces we can't forget
In debt to the very distinction of love and hate
They're both in our hearts, we choose an imbalance
Oh, the thought, we are the flaws that make us.

That must be why (What's the right word for this?)
I'm suffering (Ashamed? No, horrified)

It's an action, delayed reaction
I've got taxes and bills to pay
Something's flapping its wings at me
Someone's clapping, I guess we're on TV

Stop now, you've ruined it all
Stop now, you've obtained it all
Stop now, you've ruined it all
Stop now, you've obtained it all
Stop now, you've ruined it all
Stop now, you've obtained it all
Stop now (Stop now)
Stop now (Stop now)
Stop now (Stop now)
Stop now (Stop now)
Stop now (Stop now)
(Indefinitely)

Moving in the right direction
I'm waiting to see if it comes to me
Or if it's tied to a safe that just hit the sea floor
Maybe I'll sleep, maybe I'll sleep through a century
I'm waiting to see if it comes to me
Or if it's tied to a safe that just hit the sea floor
What was going through my head? (Head)

Press the pressure point on my neck
My head will snap off and roll into the secret passage
We built for escorting the rapist to the victim
Did you manage your time?
Do you know how I do?
Downpour, downpour, downpour, downpour.
Oh, the boredom involved in patience

So, I'll make a fist and rip the threads we've sewn
Since it's come to this, it feels like nobody's home
So my cover's blown, rip open the threads we've sewn
So, I'll make a fist and rip the threads we've sewn
Since it's come to this, it feels like nobody's home
So my cover's blown, rip open the threads we've sewn
And I won't forget what it means
