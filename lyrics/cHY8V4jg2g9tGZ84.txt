I Forever Dream Within A Dream
Of A Certain City In The Sea
As I Walk The Valley Of Unrest
Behind This Mask Of Crimson Death

I Long For A Loss Of Breath
And A Most Dire Predicament
Murders In The Rue Morgue
Silence And Shadow's What I Adore

I Cant Explain Just How It Feels
The Thought Of My Premature Burial
Inside This Oblong Box I Lie
With The Hopes I'll Be Buried Alive

The Oval Portrait Upon The Wall
Will Someday Cause This House To Fall
The Power Of Words Left Unsaid
As I Join The Spirits Of The Dead

I Can't Explain Just How It Feels
The Thought Of My Premature Burial
Inside This Oblong Box I Lie
With The Hopes I'll Be Buried Alive

Well, I'm The Man Who's Used Up
Washed Up
Bricked Up

Descent Into Maelstrom
Bedlam
Redrum

Bet The Devil My Head
Misled
Bloodshed

Heart Under The Floorboards
Beats For
Lenore
Nevermore

I Cant Explain Just How It Feels
The Thought Of My Premature Burial
Inside This Oblong Box I Lie
With The Hopes I'll Be Buried Alive
