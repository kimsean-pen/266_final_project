Doctor, fetch the Anaesthetist (Anaesthetist)
Fetch the Anaesthetist, I want to go under the knife, I believe in this
Fetch the Anaesthetist (Anaesthetist)
Fetch the Anaesthetist, I want to go under the knife, I believe

You fucking spanner
Just a cog in the industrial complex
You shed the blood for the conflicted
You parasite
You're playing god and you don't care who it affects
You suck the blood of the afflicted
You suck the blood of the afflicted

Illness is not an indulgence which you should pay for
Nor is it a crime for which you should be punished
For this conviction I would endanger my health

"Shut it (oi!), just consume, crave riches and lust for fame"
No you won't see us participating in that game
Keep your twisted take on success
'Cos all I really want is what's beating in your chest

Doctor, fetch the Anaesthetist (Anaesthetist)
Fetch the Anaesthetist, I want to go under the knife, I believe in this
Fetch the Anaesthetist (Anaesthetist)
Fetch the Anaesthetist, I want to go under the knife, I believe

We drink to your health
But just to inform, this round's on you
And every day you roll the dice
We drink to your health
We capitalise on your condition
Bad luck? You pay the price
Bad luck? You pay the price

Fetch the Anaesthetist (Anaesthetist)
Fetch the Anaesthetist, I want to go under the knife, I believe in this

You sold us short
You will not profit off our health - step the fuck back
