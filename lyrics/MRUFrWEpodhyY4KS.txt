So help me, God, I love the way you taste
Like honeysuckle's dripping off your lips
I miss you tangled in them Jersey sheets
I wanna hold you just a little closer

Don't got nowhere to be
Don't got nowhere to be
'Cause me busy, busy, oh, yeah
Can't take my eyes off you
You get off on me, I go fast for you
And we getting dizzy, dizzy

That's why we need to slow down and focus
Hold on to this moment
Focus, focus, focus on you
Focus, focus, focus on you
You need to know I got you in focus
It's clear that I want this
Focus, focus, focus on you
Focus, focus, focus on you

So help me, God, I love the way you feel
I'm spilling muscat down right off my lips
Onto your body so I kiss your thighs
That drives you crazy, so you getting closer, yeah

Not in the city, but never sleep
You'll be my company
And I'll keep you busy, yeah
Can't take my eyes off you
You get off on me, I go fast for you
And we getting dizzy, dizzy

That's why we need to slow down and focus
Hold on to this moment
Focus, focus, focus on you
Focus, focus, focus on you
You need to know I got you in focus
It's clear that I want this
Focus, focus, focus on you
Focus, focus, focus on you

That's why we need to slow down and focus
Hold on to this moment
Focus, focus, focus on you
Focus, focus, focus on you
You need to know I got you in focus
It's clear that I want this
Focus, focus, focus on you
Focus, focus, focus on you
