Watching myself when I'm taking strides
But here comes the moon and it feels and it feels like an informer
Quick run away hide before they see you
You know it is all
All a glow

Walking on water seems perilous now
You got my trust and it feels
And it feels like sabotage but I'm pulling triggers back on myself
You know it is all, all I know,
Is all I know

And it feels so real from the outside looking in
And it feels so real from the outside
From the out...
From the out...
Tyrant

Capable of most anything
This crippled bird's gonna sing
Gonna bring you all the years
Is quick turn around look your shadows could
Could not
Beautiful lies for you is what they do

And it feels so real from the outside looking in
And it feels so real from the outside
From the out...
From the out...
From the out...
From the out...
Tyrant

(ohhhhh...)

I'll stay with apathy
I'm blind but I can see
The tyrant to the bone yeah...
I'll stay with apathy
I'm blind- but I can see

Don't justify me
Don't justify me
Justify me
Yeah, yeah
Don't justify me
Don't justify
Don't justify me

From the out
From the out
From the out
From the out

From the out
From the out

And it feels so real from the outside looking in
