When I'm all broke down, heading in for disaster
And I'm spinnin' down try to find a clue
And my head is tired of searching for answers
Can't figured out how I'm gonna get through the next 10 minutes

Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know oh

Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know oh

Oh, get, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, Get, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, get, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, Get, oh
Oh, oh

When I'm all burnt out and need a place to run to
No one hears me shout, lost and all alone
And I'm losing ground no one understands me
Can't figure out what I'm gonna do 'cause I just can't take it

Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know oh

Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do (what your faith can do)
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to (oh)
Don't you know oh

Oh, get, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, Get, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, get, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, Get, oh
Oh, oh

Lil' Mama: Yea, Lil Mama
Lets go
If I could think of you and smile
Ask you could stay a while
Even you gotta do
Chase your dough
That's for sure

It's my love your raising
With my heart you praising
Passion, if you staying
Ain't that amazing?

They be calling it a phase
We gonna keep phasing
Some don't wanna play the game
So they keep acing

That's a loser
See me, I'mma keep chasing
Chasing this dough oh
