I've been beaten down, I've been kicked around
But she takes it all for me.
And I lost my faith, in my darkest days
But she makes me want to believe.
They call her love, love, love, love, love.
They call her love, love, love, love, love.

She is love, and she is all I need.
She's all I need.
Well I had my ways, they were all in vain
But she waited patiently.
It was all the same, all my pride and shame
And she put me on my feet.
They call her love, love, love, love, love.
They call her love, love, love, love, love.
She is love, and she is all I need
She is love, and she is all I need
She is love, and she is all I need.
