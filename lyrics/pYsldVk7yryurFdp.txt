The foggy air around us was blinding
The foggy sea was loud behind it
It's foggy breath breathed it's water into our lungs
and we curled up around it
and we were deafened by the sound
of foggy waves' crash, it's still ringing in my ears.
But my ears and lungs are nothing
compared to my eyes, I saw something
in the sand that swept me off my feet
OH, THE BLOW!
