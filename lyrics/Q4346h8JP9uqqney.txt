(Lee, Wilde)

I'm just a lonley egg
Peel me down
I'm not afraid
What will we do
What will we do
What will we do

Walk like an egg
Yankee shake a leg, shake a leg, shake a leg
C'mon and walk like an egg
Yankee shake a leg, shake a leg, shake a leg

I'm just a lonely egg and I'm an egghead
Peel me down and I'm white and naked
Everybody thinks that I'm just a joke
Baby, baby the joke's on you

Waddling around
Egg is in town
A fellow's gotta waddle
He's hittin' full throttle

Chorus
