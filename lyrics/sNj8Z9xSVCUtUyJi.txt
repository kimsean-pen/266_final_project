She come over
Growing like a clover
In my room
In my room

'Ever, 'ever
Curling as we shiver
In my room
In my room

Never realized
Never felt so painless
In my room
In my room

A turn over her
Never had a lover
In my room
In my room

She keeps me up
She keeps me up
At night
She keeps me up, at night

Call us sinners
But we eat all our dinners
In my room
In my room

Bet she picnics
Always been a sickness
In my room
In my room

There's a clean fog mist
In the dark spot
In my room
In my room

Rest your head near
I'm feeling okay here
In my room
In my room

She keeps me up
She keeps me up
At night
She keeps me up, at night

She keeps me up
She keeps me up
At night
She keeps me up, at night
