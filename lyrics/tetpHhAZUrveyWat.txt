Baby, I would do anything for you, for you
Nobody's ever treated me quite like you do
I've wasted too much time (wasted too much time)
I've wasted too much time (wasted too much time)
And I'm gonna tell you what's on my mind
Yeah, yeah

I was wrong all along
There could be somebody like thee
Here, we are finally
I've found my, I've found my

Maybe, it'll be quite sometime
I love you forever
And we will be waiting in time

I'm wasting no more time (wasting no more time)
I'm wasting no more time (wasting no more time)
I'm always gonna tell you what's on my mind
Yeah, yeah

I was wrong all along
There could be somebody like thee
Here, we are finally
I've found my, I've found my

I was wrong all along
There could be somebody like thee
Here, we are finally
I've found my, I've found my, I've found my

I was wrong all along
There could be somebody like thee
Here, we are finally
I was wrong all along

There could be somebody like thee
Here, we are finally
I was wrong all along
There could be somebody like thee
Here, we are finally
