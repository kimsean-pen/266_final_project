All I wanna know
Is when you go
Do you think of me

Cause I could let you go
But there'd be a hole
Where my heart used to be

It's so easy holding you near
I could melt in your arms and disappear
Loving you baby is breaking my heart tonight
It's so easy but it isn't right

I saw you today
You walked away
And I couldn't breathe

Cause I know how it will feel
It's a love so real
When you're touching me

It's so easy holding you near
I could melt in your arms and disappear
Loving you baby is breaking my heart tonight
It's so easy but it isn't right

Every night I lay here alone
After you leave me and go home
She doesn't know that we can't let go
And it's hurting me so

It's so easy holding you near
I could melt in your arms and disappear
Loving you baby is breaking my heart tonight
It's so easy but it isn't right
It's so easy but it isn't right
No, it's so easy but it isn't right

Baby it's so easy
