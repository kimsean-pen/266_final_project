Well I know you like the party, but the party never stops
I know you like the party, but the party never stops
well I know you
I know you
I know you

I know you want to be here so you just let go
and no one's ever gonna tell you no
but I want to, cause I know you I know you

But you party on, party on
get your party on
get your party on

[Chorus:]
This is my last advice leave with me cause you could die tonight
(I got this, I got this, I got this so go ahead home)
the drugs you used as a place to hide, it's really bad if you don't get this right
(I got this, I got this, I got this I don't need you)

You got kicked out of your mothers house
You stole money from her purse she finally found you out
You should be ashamed, (don't sit there judging me)
what a waste (you'd be the same if you could see, so lets have another drink)

And we'll party on, party on
get your party on
get your party on

[Chorus]

February is still as scary, the month your father died
a little girl in a shrieking world, looking for her place
to run and hide

Well I know you like the party, but the party never stops
I know you like the party, but the party never stops
well I know you
I know you
I know you

But you party on, party on
get your party on
get your party on
give it one last time cause this is all you've got!

[Chorus]
