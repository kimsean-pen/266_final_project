Expose them to the air
Drag them by the hair
If you ask i'm feeling fine
Malignant to benign

Show up throw up into the womb
Show up throw up into the womb
Show up throw up into the womb
Show up throw up into the womb

Each breath is but a sigh
She never bat an eye
It's not polite to stare
Wool spun from her hair

Show up throw up into the womb
Show up throw up into the womb
Show up throw up into the womb
Show up throw up into the womb

Obedient and shy
With button nose and eyes
Recoil at his prayer
I'm biased to be fair
