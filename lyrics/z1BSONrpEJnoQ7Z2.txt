She's the only girl I see
She don't wanna be with a boy like me
A boy like me
A boy like me
A boy like me
She don't wanna be with a boy like me

She makes my heart beat a little faster
Her life is perfect, mine's a disaster
She wouldn't call me even if I asked her
That's why I wrote this song on a black telecaster

She's the kinda girl that you can never please
She don't even really wanna talk to me
She's the kinda girl that you can never please
She don't even really wanna talk to me

She's the only girl I see
She don't wanna be with a boy like me
A boy like me
A boy like me
She don't wanna be with a boy like me

She watches movies on her big screen
She got a beamer when she was 16
Man I'm a loser and she's the prom queen
Yeah she only hangs out with the kids in the cool scene

I don't wanna live another day like this
In a world where she don't even know that I exist
No I don't wanna live another day like this
In a world where she don't even know that I exist

She's the only girl I see
She don't wanna be with a boy like me
She so has society
She don't wanna be with a boy like me
A boy like me She makes my heart beat a little faster
Her life is perfect, mine's a disaster

She's the only girl I see
She don't wanna be with a boy like me
She so has society
She don't wanna be with a boy like me
Like me
A boy like me
