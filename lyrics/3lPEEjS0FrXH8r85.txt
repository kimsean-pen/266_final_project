Is your heart singing out of tune?
Are your eyes just sing the blues?
Dirty records from another time
Some bloods stain on your shoes

No one really knows about your soul
And I barely really know your name
Burning rythym and posting lies
And I bunch you full drown in shame

Amy, don't you go
I want you around
Singing oh, please, don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?

Did you tattoo a lucky charm
To keeps out of harms pain?
Warning all of evil signs
But never really kept you safe

Now you're too young for the golden age
'Cause the record's been replaced
Twenty-seven gone without a trace
And you walked away from your drink

Amy, don't you go
I want you around
Singing oh, please, don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of

Amy, please don't go
Amy, please don't go

Is your heart singing out of tune?
Are your eyes just sing the blues?
Dirty records from another time
Some bloods stain on your shoes

May I have this last dance
By chance if we should meet?
Can you write me a lullaby
So we can sing you to sleep?

Amy, don't you go
I want you around
Singing oh, please, don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
