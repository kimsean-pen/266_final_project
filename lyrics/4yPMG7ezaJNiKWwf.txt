Recite his ego
To fall through a phone
It's narrow, doubt the wire
Boiling to the bone
Press it more he won't confess
Remember cool and nodding, Jess
Mind the merchant not the buyer
Can this cord be cut, Jess?

Will it end this way?
Will it end this way?
Will the epitaph say...

Nausea keep it down
Disgusted, don't know how
A jerk dressed up in a gentleman's clothes
Just older, uptight now
As a patient, he's compelled
A desire to be found
Just returning to himself
He's been eating like a cow

Will it end this way?
Will it end this way?
Will the epitaph say
Oh... "Insufferable"?

A distance which persists
And choose our roots to grow
When the factory shuts down
Let the boy go home
Let the boy go home
Repeat it conceit with no concept the feeling
Your minds been point interrogate
To read his point, retold, repeating

Will it end this way?
Will it end this way?
Will the epitaph say
"Insufferable"
