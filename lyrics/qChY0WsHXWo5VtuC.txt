I knew I never deserved you, I just felt so high inside
I move along, I shuffled in place then, back hand and your pulling me in
Will I ever find anyone, you make me feel like I've been lost somewhere
Now it's morning and it's over, and now it's over

Am I right where I need to be, or is this another distraction
Is this how I'm supposed to feel, I've been trying to wake you
Is there a change you need to see, or is this another disaster
Tell me how I'm supposed to feel, I've been trying to wake you

No this is never what I wanted, never what I thought I signed up for
And I keep moving away, to the edge then I'll decide weather jump or stay asleep
Sometimes the leap of fath is all, faith is all we have, why won't you tell me

Am I right where I need to be, or is this another distraction
Is this how I'm supposed to feel, I've been trying to wake you
Is there a change you need to see, or is this another disaster
Tell me how I'm supposed to feel, I've been trying to wake you

Oh why won't you wake up
Wake up, nobody's sleeping anymore
And i've had enough of the ground, made my escape, fell in love with the sound,
and i'll bang my fist till you wake up, why aren't you waking up

And the sun is coming out, when the sun is coming out
And I can't hide here anymore, no no oh no
When the sun is coming out...

Am I right where I need to be, or is this another distraction
Is this how I'm supposed to feel, I've been trying to wake you
Is there a change you need to see, or is this another disaster
Tell me how I'm supposed to feel, I've been trying to wake you

Why, why won't you wake up
Why won't you wake up
Why won't you wake up...
