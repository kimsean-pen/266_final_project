And sometimes you feel so deserted
But I hold on cause help is on the way
And sometimes you feel so deserted
But I hold on cause help is on the way

And sometimes you feel so deserted
But I hold on cause help is on the way
And sometimes you feel so deserted
But I hold on cause help is on the way

And sometimes you feel so deserted
But I hold on cause help is on the way
And sometimes you feel so deserted
But I hold on cause help is on the way
