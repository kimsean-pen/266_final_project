Let's hang the jury
You sick judgemental fools
I'll bury you six feet deep
Cause I'm tired of your rules

Fuck you and your opinion
How could you be so blind?
What goes around
Comes back around in time

You don't know shit
You don't know shit
About me
You dont know shit shit shit
Dont know a god damn thing about me

Keep looking down on me
I am more than you'll ever be
Cut me deep but I wont bleed
Gonna kick kick
Kick me when I'm down

By all means
Put me through hell
And I'll make you see
I'll be your worst enemy
Try to kick kick kick me when I'm down
Kick me when I'm down

Of all the sinners
You're first in line
So go to hell and tell the devil
I'm not that far behind

Fuck you and your decision
Cause it's not mine
What goes around
Comes back around in time

You don't know shit
You don't know shit
About me
You don't know shit shit shit
Don't know a god damn thing about me

Keep looking down on me
I am more than you'll ever be
Cut me deep but I won't bleed
Gonna kick kick
Kick me when I'm down

By all means
Put me through hell
And I'll make you see
I'll be your worst enemy
Try to kick kick kick me when I'm down
Youre gonna kick me when I'm down
Kick kick kick me when I'm down

Kick me when I'm down
Kick me when I'm down down
Down
Down
Kick me when I'm down
Down
Down
Kick me when I'm down
