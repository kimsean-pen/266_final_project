Wide open, you
Tiny on a rock ledge
Feet dangled
In the brassy sun

Where have I been?
Where have I been?
Where have I been?

In a drug daze
In that sun gaze
In that glossy haze

And do I know you?
Do I even know you?
In that photo fright of you

Where have I been?
Where have I been?
Where have I been?
