Yuh, okay, so don't look down, yuh, haha *humming*
Okay, alright

They feed us hate with a crude smell
To throw us all in a cell
Heaven's not a place on Earth
Earth is a place in Hell

Pull up then I tear down every stigma that they made,
they've been plotting on my downfall like I'm gonna change my ways
You live life for nothing
You're so fucking disgusting
Everything you said to me
That shit wasn't meant to be
There is nothing left for me
Death is the enemy
You live life for nothing
You're so fucking disgusting
Clawing at my scars
They would heal if I ain't touch it
I think staying sober's hard
Yeah, I pull that shit out public
Want to talk shit?
Then go on
I can really handle judgment
Got these markings on my arm
'Cause I'm fucking self-destructive
There ain't shit that I'm proud of
I'm so sick of this household, we call Earth
I would like it, but it's fucking filled with assholes
B-B-Beat us down with passion, aye
We will go out laughing, aye
It's true to say I lost all my patience when I got betrayed
When I speak like an annihilistic
They say I'm pushing for violence
When they are the serpents
That slither in silence
I like to hide on my own, aye
Helps me to chill and unload, aye
Nothin' but gas in the roach, aye
Grey clouds help us cope, aye
Doing fine for so long, yeah
Living life through my songs, aye
Wanna know what my life is like
I count cash all day long

They feed us hate with a crude smell
To throw us all in a cell
Heavens not a place on Earth
Earth is a place in Hell
Earth is a place in Hell

You're so fucking disgusting
Everything you said to me
That shit wasn't meant to be
There is nothing left for me
Death is the enemy
You live life for nothing
You're so fucking disgusting
I know that you hate me
You think I'm two different people
Say I'm fucking crazy
Say I'm fucking evil

(Break!)
All this hate pushes my revenge
I'm too smart to fall in love again
You're so fucking disgusting.
