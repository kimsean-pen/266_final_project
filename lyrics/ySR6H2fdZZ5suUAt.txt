Dark horizons come close to me
And magic will be my key
I will travel through the gate
To be the finder of my fate
Nox, the night and key
I will open your old mystery
Key of night, open up
Key of night, open up
Deep abysses I sink into
And behind the light I go
My long journey never end
But I will receive what I send
Nox, the night and key
I will open your old mystery
Key of night, open up
Key of night, open up
Clavicula Nox
