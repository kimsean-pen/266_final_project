God knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts
Guess you kissed the girls and made them cry
Those hard-faced queens of misadventure
God knows what is hiding in those weak and sunken eyes
Fiery throngs of muted angels
Giving love and getting nothing back

Oh, people, help the people
And if you're homesick
Give me your hand and I'll hold it
People, help the people
Nothing will drag you down
Oh and if I had a brain
Oh and if I had a brain
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
That turned all those good hearts away

God knows what is hiding in this world of little consequence
Behind the tears, inside the lies
A thousand slowly dying sunsets
God knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts
Guess the loneliness came knocking
No one needs to be alone, oh, save me

People, help the people
And if you're homesick
Give me your hand and I'll hold it
People, help the people
Nothing will drag you down
Oh and if I had a brain
Oh and if I had a brain
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
That turned all those good hearts away

Na na na na na na, ooh
Na na na na na na, ooh

People, help the people
And if you're homesick
Give me your hand and I'll hold it
People, help the people
Nothing will drag you down
Oh and if I had a brain
Oh and if I had a brain
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
That turned all those good hearts away
