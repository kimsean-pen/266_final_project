Summer fades and winter takes it's dreary place
That's what I have seen
Love is faillure and I never win the race
That's what I believed

If love strikes once and one time only
All I'd have is broken dreams inside of me
My hands trace love
Hearts surround you
And what you see is how my colours scream
That love is striking me

Thought I'd spend the greatest years curled up alone
Without someone to kiss my lips
Thought I'd feel the wintercold more than anyone
'Cause I woudn't have the family that I dreamed since I was born

If love strikes once and one time only
All I'd have is broken dreams inside of me
My hands trace love
Hearts surround you
And what you see is how my colours scream
That love is striking me

You came late
But I left the light on
For you, babe
Never let my hurt burn my hope away
And now I give you all I saved

Summer fades and winter takes it's dreary place
But now look at the smile on my face
Here's love
Love is striking me

If love strikes once and one time only
All I'd have is broken dreams inside of me
My hands trace love
Hearts surround you
And what you see is how my colours scream
That love is striking me
