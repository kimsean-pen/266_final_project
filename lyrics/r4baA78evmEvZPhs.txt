I am a girl of constant sorrow
Have seen troubles all my days
I'm goin' back to California
Place where I was partly raised

All through this world I'm bound to ramble
Through sun and wind and drvin' rain
I'm bound to ride the western railways
Perhaps I'll take the very next train

Your friends may think that I'm a stranger
My face you'll never see no more
There's a one promise that is given
I'll see you on God's golden shore

I am a girl of constant sorrow
Have seen troubles all my days
I'm goin' back to California
Place where I was partly raised
