Marble in a foyer
I've been lovin' on you all day
Would've stayed if you told me to stay
As you can see I stayed anyway
I'm just not like these other girls, I swear
I just have to love you
I just wanna need you, if that's okay
And you're just not like these other men out here
Oh no, you just wanna hold me
And that's okay

Can I be a woman for you, baby
In a time when it's not allowed
How am I supposed to pretend
That I don't want you, the way I do (Oh yeah)
'Cause every time you're around me
I feel virgin all over again
And every time you're all around me
How can I renege? Boy I just need your hand

Is it okay that I'm not independent?
Is it okay that I...
Is it okay that I show weakness?
Is it okay that I...
Is it okay to can't wait to see you?
Is it okay that I...
Is it okay to love a man right now?

If you understand
Then show me your hands, (Ooh hoo)
Show me your hands
Boy if you understand
Somebody raised a man (Ooh hoo)
Raised a man

I've never been treated a way I didn't want to be treated
It's hard to explain, I know it's hard to believe
I want what's calming me
Perfection, protection (Please, love)
Bring me all night long, woah
Makin' love to our favourite songs
Your love teaches me how to love, so deep
Baby, it's so sweet
Can't wait to pass you down
To the face that resembles you and me

Is it okay that I'm not independent?
Is it okay that I...
Is it okay that I show weakness?
Is it okay that I...
Is it okay to can't wait to see you?
Is it okay that I...
Is it okay to love a man right now?

If you understand
Then show me your hands (Ooh hoo)
Show me your hands
Boy if you understand
Somebody raised a man (Ooh hoo)
Raised a man

Ooh-ho-oh
Ooh-ho-oh

Everyday, and every night I pray for one accord
I adore you even more
And every minute that passes me by
We can't afford for us to be ignored
See we need each other more than we even know (Oh ho)

Somebody made a man
So show me how to raise a man (Ooh hoo)
Raise a man
You can't be a man
If we don't raise a man (Ooh hoo)
Raise a man
If you want a man
Then you gotta raise a man (Ooh hoo)
Raise a man
If you understand
Then show me your hands (Ooh hoo)
Show me your hands
