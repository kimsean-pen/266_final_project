You know I don't like dancin'
An' I don't like to bop
Too much movement's exertion
Makes me wish I could drop
Dro' dro' dro' dro' dro' dro' drop

An' I don't like french kissin'
Cos you swallow my tongue
And you think that you're oh so very old
You only want me 'cos you think I'm so young
Yo' yo' yo' yo' yo' yo' young

All right
Ok
No way

An' I wish I was sixteen again
Then things would be such fun
All the things I'd do would be the same
But they're much more fun
Than when you're twenty wo' wo' wo' wo' wo' one

All right
Ok
No way

An' I hate modern music
Disco boogie pop
They go on an' on an' on an' on an' on
How I wish they would stop
