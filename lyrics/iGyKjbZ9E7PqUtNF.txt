I took a bite out of a mountain range
Thought my teeth would break, the mountain did...
Let's go, I want to go
All the way to the horizon...

I took a drink out of the ocean and I'm treading water there before I drown
Let's dive, I want to dive
To the bottom of the ocean

Took a ride, I took a ride
I wouldn't go there without you.
Let's take a ride, we'll take a ride
I wouldn't leave here without you.

I am a mountain.
I am the sea.
You can't take that away from me...
I am a mountain.
I am the sea.
You can't take that away from me...

'Cause you tear us apart, with all the things you don't like
You can't understand that I won't leave 'til we're finished here, and then you'll find out
Where it all went wrong...
I wrote a note to the jungle and

They wrote me back that I was never crowned...
King of the jungle, so there's an end to my horizon...
Took a ride, I took a ride

I wouldn't go there without you.
Let's take a ride, we'll take a ride
I wouldn't leave here without you
I am a mountain.

I am the sea.
You can't take that away from me...
I am a mountain.
I am the sea.
'Cause you tear us apart, with all the things you don't like

You can't understand that I won't leave 'til we're finished here, and then you'll find out
Where it all went wrong...
Nothing lasts forever, except you and me.
You are my mountain, you are my sea...

Love can last forever, between you and me.
You are my mountain, you are my sea...
I am a mountain...
I am the sea...
You can't take that away from me.
I am a mountain...
I am the sea...
I am a mountain...
I am the sea...
