I tried to tip my toes in your water
Cold as the breeze
Tryna stop befalling me under where I can't breathe
And people keep on saying that I need to go deeper 'fore I can see
They say that my denial is stopping the grieve

It all taste like you
You're everywhere I go
So how can I believe it's true
When they say you've flown

'Cause even when the light shines
I feel you right beside me
Till you're gone, gone, gone
And even in my downtime
Hear you whisper softly
Then you're gone, gone, gone

I do
I try to dip my toes in the water cold as the breeze, yeah
(Even when the light shines)
But the deeper that I go I start losing focus on you

And even when the light shines
I feel you right beside me
Then you're gone, gone, gone
And even in my downtime
Hear you whisper softly
If you're gone, gone, gone

How you gonna talk with me?
How you gonna walk around and think 'bout me?
How you gonna do the things we've done?
(Oh the things we do) we do
And how you gonna smoke with me?
If you don't exist I'm talking to the breeze
I never gave you permission to go
(You're leaving)

I feel you in my life
(Even when the light shines)
I feel you in my life
(Even when the light shines)
Still you feel you in my life
(Even when the light shines)
Feel you in my life
(Even when the light shines)
Feel you in my life
(Even when the light shines)
Feel you in my life
(Even when the light shines)
To feel you in my life
(Even when the light shines)
(Even when the light...)
Even when the light shines
Even when the light shines
Even when the light shines
