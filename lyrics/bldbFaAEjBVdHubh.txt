They say love is in the air
So why can't I breathe in this repair

Let's say we trade heartbeats
what's mine is yours and yours is mine
For when you're here with me
I sleep so peacefully at night

Now heavy coats we wear
Snow clinging to your hair

Let's say we both believe
That maybe all we need is time
Then maybe truthfully
We will be perfectly aligned

I don't care what they say
I am already awake
My hands are shaking for you
For you

Let's say our lips will meet
We'll become lovers as I've seen
It can be black and white
or all the spectrums in bet
