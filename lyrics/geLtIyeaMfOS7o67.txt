In the past I always tried
I never got amongst the glittering prizes
I put it down to confidence
Or something trendy
Like an emotional complex

Thinking to myself that I've got something to prove
Waiting for the chance to accept my point of view
Pretty soon you will recognise me
Glittering prizes for me
Glittering prizes for me

I wear a clean shirt every day
I quite enjoy my job as an office boy
The novelty begins to fade
I never get the chance
To play with executive toys

Thinking to myself that I've got something to prove
Waiting for the chance to accept my point of view
Pretty soon you won't recognise me
Glittering prizes for me
Glittering prizes for me
