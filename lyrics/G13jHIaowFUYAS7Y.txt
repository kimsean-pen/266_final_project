I'd love to travel free and see the old roads that i've known
like 69, when i was just nineteen
don't need a great revival, lord knows i've been through it all
i just want to provide myself that good old feeling
don't know when I'll let go.

I can't stay here
I can't stay here
I can't stay here for a life like this

my generation gave us plastic wallets tied to gold
they'll sit in my back pocket til i die
i try to keep the ship afloat, but it was built with holes
and every day i dream of a new life
cus this never felt right

I can't stay here
I can't stay here
I can't stay here for a life like this
I can't stay here
I can't stay here
I can't stay here for a life like this
I can't stay here for a life like this

I'll buy an old conversion, drive it down the great west coast
who knows how far she'll make it in this world
don't need a great revival, lord knows i've lived through it all
i just want to provide myself that good old feeling
don't know when I'll let go
