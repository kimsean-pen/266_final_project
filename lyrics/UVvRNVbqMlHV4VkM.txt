You should call me tonight
While you're sleeping
So I can talk to
All of your dreams
And they'll tell me what to do
When I'm alone with you
Cause I really do not understand
What the fuck is wrong with you
I've been crazy for this boy
I really like his gun
I think he's kinda crazy
But I got no way to run
And he tells me what to do
He wants me to kill you
And I really think I might
Because Heather I hate you
