It's the way of the world
Remember you were in school and I followed you home
I remember, didn't think I existed
But we're comin' together right now

I've been runnin', I've been hidin'
It's the way of the world
You say it's over
But the world keeps turnin' 'round

Remember, I knew I'd be good for you
No one better remember, really meant what I said
Wanna be your lover right now

I've been runnin', I've been hidin'
It's the way of the world
You say it's over
But the world keeps turnin' 'round

World goes round
Life goes on and on and on
You say it's over
But the world keeps turnin' 'round

It's the way of the world

Remember you were at work and then Friday at five
I remember, felt like a pawn, was I dead or alive?
I remember, thought no one could hear me, I was goin' insane
I remember, it was a real fine line, now you've changed my life around

I've been runnin', I've been hidin'
It's the way of the world
You say it's over
But the world keeps turnin' 'round

World goes round
Life goes on and on and on
World goes round
(I've been runnin')
World is round
(I've been hidin')
Life goes on and on and on
(It's the way of the world)

World goes round
(I've been runnin')
World is round
(I've been hidin')
Life goes on and on and on
(It's the way of the world)

World goes 'round
(I've been runnin')
World is round
(I've been hidin')
