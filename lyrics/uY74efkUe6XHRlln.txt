As the water drips from the sky, I start to wander
If I'm still alive then I have to find the answer
Could it be that it was a dream, and I'm still beside her?
Right before my eyes, a tragic surprise...
The water stops

Wickedness will rain...
And drown us in her sorrow
(And her thirst!)
If I hope to survive...
I must think faster
(I'm losing ground!)

Should I pull back her veil?

You had the best of me...
(Now taste the worst!)
All that glimmers is not gold

I may be wrong, but your brilliance is my darkness
You had me convinced...
That together we could fly
Until I started scratching at the surface
(And I saw beyond your masquerade)
Your body is an illness

Temples crashing down...
All around me, panic
(Chokes the streets!)
The golden city falls...
And with it our lives go up in flames

Should I pull back her veil?

You had the best of me...
(Now taste the worst!)
All that glimmers is not gold

I may be wrong, but your brilliance is my darkness
You had me convinced...
That together we could fly
Until I started scratching at the surface
(And I saw beyond your masquerade)
Your body is an illness

(All shall be made clear...)

We've been watching you, wander
(My blood runs cold)
There's no need to run farther
(I fear I know the truth)
(Come into our arms, brother)
I tear back the cowl, and stare into my own eyes!

Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?

(Yeah!)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey!)

I pull back the veil...

You had the best of me...
(Now taste the worst)
All that glimmers is not gold

I may be wrong, but your brilliance is my darkness
You had me convinced...
That together we could fly
Until I started scratching at the surface
(And I saw beyond your masquerade)
Your body is an illness

(And I'm sickened by the thought of you)
I may never be the same again
(I may never be the same again)
