Timeless we are
Timeless we are
Children running
Through

I lost myself in you
Found myself in truth
Lose ourselves along the way

Sky's changing
Sky's changing
Distant lightning
Far the falling rain

I lost myself in you
Found myself in truth
Lose ourselves along the way
Find ourselves in time again

Lost myself in you
Found myself in truth
Golden summer skies
Shadows form, dance and die

Lost myself in you
Found myself in truth
Brooding clouds not far away
Dark the storm that's coming
