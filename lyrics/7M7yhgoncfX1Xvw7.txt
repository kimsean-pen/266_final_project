The wind gathers the clouds in the sky
empyrean cracks and roars
the calm before the storm grows now to thunder's song
gone are the singing birds, silently sigh only the trees.
Hear now the moment when the son of thunder speaks

The roar in crescendo, fills hte dark air and once more
The bringer of chaos makes the wind rise again
Watch him whirling, dancing in the step of time...
In the flash of lightning appears the majesty of skies

As the tempest sets world on to it's knees,
Still steady stands one man brave
Challenging alone the nature
Screaming fiercely ovet the gale

Filled with the anger are also phrases of storm
And easily from the ground apart is the man soon torn
Cold is their embrance, of iron their handshake both
Mortal facing undying and the warring of their powers

For thousand years last their struggle,
One teardrop shed for every year, still
Enough to bring forth the thousand lakes,
enough for thousand rivers to shape
and as the northwind rises again
and the heaven cracks and roars
once more two headstrong figures
will test to defeat each others
