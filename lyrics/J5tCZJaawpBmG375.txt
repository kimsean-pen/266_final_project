You got it all wrong, baby I call the shots
I'm not what you need and I thought we agreed
That all I do is leave

Your girl's out cold and you gotta stay warm
Now you're at my front door, I know I'm hard to ignore
But all I do is leave, all I do is leave

It's not that I'm one of the bad girls
Just don't wanna be one of your sad girls

I'll do as I please
I don't need no man holding me
If my mind is at ease, then maybe I'll call you at three

I got you wrapped around my finger now you're begging to stay
Just for today, you think I won't slip away
But all I do is leave

You think you got me in a coma but I'm not here to sleep
Get your mind off of me, while you're getting dizzy
All I do is leave, all I do is leave

It's not that I'm one of the bad girls
Just don't wanna be one of your sad girls

I'll do as I please
I don't need no man holding me
If my mind is at ease, then maybe I'll call you at three

Don't need your money, I'm not your honey
Don't need nobody holding me
I'm not your sweet girl, or a mean girl
But baby if you fall I will leave

I'll do as I please
I don't need no man holding me
If my mind is at ease, then maybe I'll call you at three
