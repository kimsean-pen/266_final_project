When I wake up
In the morning light
I pull on my jeans
And I feel all right

I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on

It's the weekend
And I know that you're free
So pull on your jeans
And come on out with me

I need to have you near me
I need to feel you close to me
I need to have you near me
I need to feel you close to me

You and me, we'll go motorbike riding
In the sun and the wind and the rain
I got money in my pocket
Got a tiger in my tank
And I'm king of the road again

I'll meet you in the usual place
I don't need a thing
Except your pretty face

And I need to have you near me
I need to feel you close to me
I need to have you near me
I need to feel you close to me
I need to have you near me
I need to feel you close to me

You and me, we'll go motorbike riding
In the sun and the wind and the rain
I got money in my pocket
Got a tiger in my tank
And I'm king of the road again

When I wake up
In the morning light
I pull on my jeans
And I feel all right

I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on

When I wake up
In the morning light
I pull on my jeans
And I feel all right

I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on

When I wake up
In the morning light
I pull on my jeans
And I feel all right

I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on...
