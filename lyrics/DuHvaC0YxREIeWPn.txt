I've run away from you
Erased my love tattoo
But you're the one that makes my heart beat faster
It's just the games you play
That makes it hard to stay
I feel we're heading for complete disaster

I'm staying 'cause I need you
Oh, I do

You know my weakness
That is why I'm sleepless
Baby I'm thinking of your love

You know my weakness
That is why I'm sleepless
Baby I'm thinking of your love

Oh, you know I'm sleepless

I told you everything
Unlocked, then let you in
That's how it is for me
It's all or nothing
I sort of lost control
I loved and you said no
Are we okay or are we simply fading

I'm waiting for your answer
Oh, I do

You know my weakness
That is why I'm sleepless
Baby I'm thinking of your love

You know my weakness
That is why I'm sleepless
Baby I'm thinking of your love

Oh, you know I'm sleepless

I like to make myself believe
That you for once will think of me
And kiss me when I fall asleep

You know my weakness
That is why I'm sleepless, oh
You know my weakness
That is why I'm sleepless
Baby I'm thinking of your love

You know my weakness
That is why I'm sleepless
Baby I'm thinking of your love
Oh-oh-oh
You know my weakness
That is why I'm sleepless
Baby I'm thinking of your love
Oh-oh-oh

Oh, you know I'm sleepless
Oh, you know I'm sleepless
Another sleepless night

You know my weakness
That is why I'm sleepless
Baby I'm thinking of your love

You know my weakness
That is why I'm sleepless
Baby I'm thinking of your love

Oh, you know I'm sleepless
