What is certain I have ignored
I have spent most of my life
Trying to complicate everything that I believe
So that what paralyzed

In thought I will always have an alibi
Just another excuse, just another excuse
To hesitate, to hesitate
Delaying true progress with passivity

The answers that I've found
Are all the same
They uncover questions
That still remain

The answers that I've found
Are all the same
They uncover questions
That still remain

What is certain I have ignored
And what I know is simple
If I'm honest with myself
My soul is broken yet easily fixed

And what I know is simple
I must die if I truly want to live

The answers that I've found
Are all the same
They uncover questions
That still remain

The answers that I've found
Are all the same
They uncover questions
That still remain

The greatness of us have become the least
I must be reborn to revive the heart that hardly beats
Keeping alive this hollow frame
I must be reborn, I must be reborn
