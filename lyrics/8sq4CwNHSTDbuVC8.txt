This has been no walk in the park
I feel like we have fallen apart
Open up your eyes girl and see
How wonderful this love could be

Hold on tight
It's a roller coaster ride we're on so
Say goodbye
'Cause I won't be back again
Up and down
You're all around
Say goodnight

And goodbye

Lalala la la lalalala
You say you didn't mean to break
My heart but girl you did
But I'm over it
Adeiu to you and all your games

All your crazy friends
This is the end
Hold on tight
It's a roller coaster ride we're on so
Say goodbye
'Cause I won't be back again
Up and down

You're all around

Say goodnight
And goodbye
Lalala la la lalalala
Well girl, I'm sorry for

Disappointing you
But I'm done
With being up and down and pushed around
No more
Hold on tight
It's a roller coaster ride we're on so
Say goodbye

'Cause I won't be back again
Up and down
You're all around
Say goodnight
And goodbye
Hold on tight
It's a roller coaster ride we're on
Say goodbye
'Cause I won't be back again
Up and down
You're all around
Say goodnight
And goodbye!
