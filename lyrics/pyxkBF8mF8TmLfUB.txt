I'm Hannah, I go here, I'm cuckoo bananas
Why can't you understand me?
I'm crazy, yeah I promise,
But come meet my mama - it's Ali, she understands me
Why can't you understand me?

Math class kills me,
Weed makes me silly,
I like good music,
Don't you wanna love me?
Math class kills me,
Weed makes me hungry,
I like good music,
Don't you wanna love me at all?

I'm Hannah, from SoCal, from sunshine and hoedowns
Why can't you understand me?
My eyes look like diamonds,
The boys all be tryin'
But those boys don't understand me.
Why can't you understand me?

Math class kills me,
Weed makes me silly,
I like good music,
Don'y you wanna know me?
Math class kills me,
Weed makes me horny,
I like good music,
Don't you wanna love me at all?

I'm Hannah, I go here, I'm cuckoo bananas
Why can't you understand me?
Why can't you understand me?
