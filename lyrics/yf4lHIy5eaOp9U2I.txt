I came to ask you out, been wanting
to for days, will you go with me tonight

I will pick you up, on my blue motorbike
, I'll be there sevenish and you'd better
hold on tight, cause I like the sense
of speed, and I like the sense of you,
maybe you like me to.

I know a secret place, where the rock
steeps into sea, will you go there with
me tonight we can dive into, the black
and eerie blue, maybe we'll even kiss
and you'd better hold on tight, cause I
like the sense of falling, and I like the
sense of you, maybe you like me to

can I have this dance, cause life's a
grim waltz, and I'm to young to dance
can I have this jive, cause life's a grim
waltz, and I'm to young to dance, I'm
to young to dance
