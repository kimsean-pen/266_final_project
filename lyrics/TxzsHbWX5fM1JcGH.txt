Seems like such a long time ago
I was walking on a lonely road
Getting tired of dreamin' alone
Like all the lonely people I had known

Seems like such a long time ago
There was no one who would share my song
I was just a boy far from home
But I became a man when you came along

We spent the whole night talkin'
You said you'd like to see the sunrise
But in the gold of mornin'
Was nothing I had not seen in your eyes

I was so afraid to touch you
Thought you were too young too know
So I just watched you sleeping
Then you woke and said to me
The night is cold
It frightens me

And I could sleep so easy next to you
It wasn't very long ago
You said that you would like to share my road
Then you started singin' my song
You said so many nights are waiting
Let's not spend a moment wasting time
'Cause we have very far to go
I will go if you will take me
I have never had a lover
I am young
But I am so alone
We spent the whole night talkin'
But in the gold of mornin'
