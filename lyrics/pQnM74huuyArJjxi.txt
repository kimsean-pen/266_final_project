You keep talking in circles
Got my head spinning 'round, 'round, 'round
You can reach for the stars
But keep your feet on the ground, ground, ground
Oh you can have it all, my love
The rise and the fall
Dreams don't work
unless you're willing to work for them first
Wishing wells
ain't gonna quench your thirst, no
What you want, what you really want
What you wanna do, you wanna talk
You wanna make your dreams come true?
Then you gotta put your back into it
You gotta put your back into it
You gotta put your back into it
You gotta put your back into it
Put your back, your back, your back, back into it
Fortune favors the brave
Sometimes you go it alone, alone, alone
There's no telling how far
Until your shoes on the road, road, the road
Nothing can push you off course, yeah
When you are the storm
Dreams don't work
unless you're willing to work for them first
Wishing wells
ain't gonna quench your thirst, no
What you want, what you really want
What you wanna do, you wanna talk
You wanna make your dreams come true?
Then you gotta put your back into it
Then you gotta put your back into it
Then you gotta put your back into it
Then you gotta put your back into it
Put your back, your back, your back, back into it
Dreams don't work
unless you're willing to work for them first
Wishing wells
ain't gonna quench your thirst, no
What you want, what you really want
What you wanna do, you wanna jump
You wanna make your dreams come true?
Well then you gotta put your back into it
You gotta put your back into it
You gotta put your back into it
You gotta put your back into it
Put your back, your back, your back, back into it
