In ancient days of Khem
A Pharaoh was praising
The sun above Amon
Osiris, Mother Isis and Thoth

The gods would punish the hybris of Pharaoh
He wrapped himself in false sunshine
He was the founding father of the only god
But he provoked a fit of rage

Son of the sun: it was his name
Son of the sun: the sun will burn your wings
Son of the sun: beware of Aton
Son of the sun: your god will let you down

The sphinx burst into tears
And pyramids are shaking
The precipice is close
When Pharaoh is losing his faith

Visions of madness led the Pharaoh astray
The portents were too ominous
Until this day his curse is still the plague of man
We must defeat the only god

Son of the sun: it was his name
Son of the sun: the sun will burn your wings
Son of the sun: beware of Aton
Son of the sun: your god will let you down

Apep will rise
Apep will come
Son of the sun: it was his name
Son of the sun: the sun will burn your wings
Son of the sun: beware of Aton
Son of the sun: your god will let you down
