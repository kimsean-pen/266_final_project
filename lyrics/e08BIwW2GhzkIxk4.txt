Why do I care what you think?
You're not my father
Don't even bother, don't bother me
Why do I like how you look?
You look like candy
You don't understand me, don't understand me
I'm not doing this again
No, no, no
This will really have to be the end
No, no, no
Promise me baby, promise me baby
Promise me baby, promise me baby
You'll stay away, you'll stay away
You'll stay away, you'll stay away
Why do I think on my feet?
It's hard to stand now
Don't touch my hand now, don't touch me
Why do I make myself sick?
It's outrageous
I'm so contagious, don't come near me
I'm not doing this again
No, no, no
This will really have to be the end
No, no, no
Promise me baby, promise me baby
Promise me baby, promise me baby
You'll stay away, you'll stay away
You'll stay away, you'll stay away
