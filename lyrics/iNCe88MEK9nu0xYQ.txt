When I'm sitting so close to you
there's only one thing that I wanna do
but I know what you're likely to say
that I'm going about it the wrong way

We can't agree about anything
where to go or even where we've been
and I know what you're likely to do
say that I've never cared about you

And all I wanted to say was that I love you
but you're telling me now you don't believe it's true
You got a different, a different
a different point of view
You got a different point of view

You don't believe a single word I say
If I'd say black was white, you'd say it was grey
but in spite of being treated this way
I still dream of you all night and day

And all I wanted to say was that I love you
but you're telling me now you don't believe it's true
You got a different, a different
a different point of view
You got a different point of view

Just this once
Just say yes
Please

You've got a clever way of haunting me
I'm never scared, but you're still daunting me
'cause I know what you're likely to say
and I know that you'll get your own way

And all I wanted to say was that I love you
but you're telling me now you don't believe it's true
You got a different, a different
a different point of view
You got a different point of view
