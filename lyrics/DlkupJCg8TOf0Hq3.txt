And you can't hold me down
Because I need an answer
Because I need an answer, love
And you say way too much
But still I need an answer, love
But still I need an answer, love

Kindly be kind, wipe all the dirt from my eyes
I need an answer
I need an answer

Been up until dawn and all of my heroes are gone, babe
But I know they're out there
They say be with the one that you love
Be with the one that you love
I need an answer
I need an answer

They say be with the one that you love
Be with the one that you love
I can't make you stop, can't make you stop
Can't make you stop when you're already gone

And you can't hold me down
Because I need an answer
Because I need an answer, love

And you say way too much
But I still need an answer, love
But I still need an answer, love

Kindly be kind, wipe all the dirt from my eyes
I need an answer
I need an answer
