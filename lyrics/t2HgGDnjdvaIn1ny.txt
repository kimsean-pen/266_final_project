Could we, take a walk
Could we, have a talk alone
In the afternoon

Could we, have a seat
Why, yes, be my guest
You can hold my hand

What a dream, in the grass
We kissed, fell in love too fast, too soon
Love full bloom

Should we get up, let's wake up
Let's get dressed, I'll let you walk me up the street
Back home

Thank you, it was great
Let's make another date
Real soon
In the afternoon
