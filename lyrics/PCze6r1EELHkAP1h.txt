I can't stand the words they say
But they won't stop talking anyway
Do they know what's right or wrong?
Do they really know the truth?

Everybody's looking for a new sensation
Everybody's seeking for more attention
Everybody's lying for his own profit
Mankind is drowning in a world of lies

There are only lies in my heart and in my life
I hold the future in my hands
I don't think I can change the world
But I will always try to fight against all these lies
