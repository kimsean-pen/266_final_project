Burn
Strings tied to their lives now burn
Burn
Ropes tied around their hands shall burn
Stuck in time
Help being blind
Desperation rises
Starve for lie
Fed with lies
Passion for life imprisoned

Tears
Ashes from tears, on hope's face, runs
Lost
Flame in peaces' heart was long time lost
Ember's voice
Wisdoms choice
Freedom, one aspires
Glimpse of hope
Gone as smoke
Freedom reached through fire
Walls raised by oppression,
Yet invisible
Down, they can't be torn
Flames lit by repression
Burning silence, one cannot ignore

Blazing cries, hatred resents
Pain leads to soul's deliverance
Drifting from hands of contempt
Fire led to soul's resilience
