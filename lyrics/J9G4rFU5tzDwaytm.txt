Here we come
Walkin' down the street
We get the funniest looks from
Everyone we meet
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
And people say we monkey around
But we're too busy singing
To put anybody down
We go wherever we want to
Do what we like to do
We don't have time to get restless
There's always something new
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
And people say we monkey around
But we're too busy singing
To put anybody down
We're just tryin' to be friendly
Come and watch us sing and play
We're the young generation
And we've got something to say, oh
Any time
Or anywhere
Just look over your shoulder
Guess who'll be standing there?
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
And people say we monkey around
But we're too busy singing
To put anybody down
Whaaa, one time!
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
And people say we monkey around
But we're too busy singing
To put anybody down
We're just tryin' to be friendly
Come and watch us sing and play
We're the young generation
And we've got something to say
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
