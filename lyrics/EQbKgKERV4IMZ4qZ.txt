We were young, unafraid
We were finding our own way
There is no wind, there is no rain
In the eye of the hurricane
Every time you climb that mountain
There's another one left to climb
Don't go looking for tomorrow
Leaving yesterday behind

Writing every page together
Those days were not to last forever
Diamonds in the rough
When we were us
Burn the house and torch the skyline
There was more than fire in our eyes
Love meant more than lust
When we were us

We were one, born and raised
More than blood runs through these veins
Cuts can heal, scars will fade
What we had will never change
Seasons pass and time will move on
You don't ever have to let it go
You can only go so far now
Till you're on your way back home

Writing every page together
Those days were not to last forever
Diamonds in the rough
When we were us
Burn the house and torch the skyline
There was more than fire in our eyes
Love meant more than lust
When we were us

Memories are nothing more than ghosts that we let in
Don't be afraid of them, do you remember when

Writing every page together
Those days were not to last forever
Diamonds in the rough
When we were us
Burn the house and torch the skyline
There was more than fire in our eyes
Love meant more than lust
When we were us
When we were us
