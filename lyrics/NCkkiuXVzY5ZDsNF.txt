In memory you're 17
in your boyfriend's Econoline
at the Aquatorium in Gary
A dress shirt & his favorite jeans
His hair is long & smelling good
The music loud & when he looks into your eyes

It was true love
Don't ever let them tell you any different
It was true love
True love love

A month after you left for school
he crashed his van & he was killed
He had your name tattooed you never saw it
You got the call & didn't cry
You blew off class & got the bus
They whispered when they saw you at the funeral

that it was true love
Don't ever let them tell you any different
It was true love
True love love

& now your dog has got his name
You never tell anyone that
His memory's your one constant companion

& it was true love
Don't ever let them tell you any different
It was true love
True love love
