If you got a minute
Get down your idea
It might do wonders
Maybe disappear
Who knows? Just get it down
And nothing can go wrong
Go find your rhythm
That's how you write a song

Enjoy the small things
With time they will get big
Gotta find your mission
A mission to pursue
You know you got a talent
Whatever it may be
So work your magic
And sing along with me

Step one: believe in it
And sing it all day long
Step two: just roll with it
That's how you write a song

Sing shoobie doobie dat dat (shoobie doobie dat dat)
Shaba daba hey (shaba daba hey)
Say all day long (all day long)
And that's how you write a song

I say skoobiedoobiedobuppa (skoobiedoobiedobuppa)
Boogie boogie woogie (boogie boogie woogie)
Say all day long (all day long)
See that's how you write a song

Step one: believe in it
And sing it all day long
Step two: just roll with it
That's how you write a song

Step one: believe in it
And sing it all day long
Step two: just roll with it
That's how you write a song

Step one: believe in it
And sing it all day long
Step two: just roll with it
That's how you write a song

Step one: believe in it
And sing it all day long
Step two: just roll with it
That's how you write a song

Step one: believe in it
And sing it all day long
Step two: just roll with it
And that's how you write a song
See that's how you write a song
And that's how you write a song
