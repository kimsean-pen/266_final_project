So put a spanner in the works,
Of your mind,
It's easier to work,
But I don't mind,
You're better in defeat so,
Just don't try
To take away all the things
I'll do in my life.

I have to break down all
The corners of the world.
Don't heed this praise on me,
I know I don't deserve it.
But what's so this I see?
Yeah you're leaving right beside me,
And I miss you, and I need you.
I do.

But don't go, take my love,
I won't let you, I'm saying please don't go.
Don't go, take my love,
I won't let you, I'm saying please don't go.

Well leave your lover now,
It's your turn.
And see your mother now,
I hope she's okay.
You're better in defeat so,
Let's not try
To take away all the things I'll do in our lives.

I have to break down all the corners of the world.
Don't heed this praise on me,
I know I don't deserve it.
But what's so this I see?
Yeah you're leaving right beside me,
And I miss you, and I need you.
I do.

But don't go, take my love,
I won't let you, I'm saying please don't go.
Don't go, take my love,
I won't let you, I'm saying please don't go.

All of my life,
Trying to understand.
All of my life,
Trying to hold a hand.

I have to break down all,
The corners of this world.
Don't heed this praise on me,
I know I don't deserve it.
But what's so this I see?
Yeah you're leaving right beside me,
And I miss you, and I love you.
That's true.
