Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my flame
Baby, be the softly burning embers
Through December until June 2008
Baby, be my conjurer
And I'll hold you dear
Baby, be the visions in the night
And wait till morning light for you
To disappear
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
Oh, be my flame
Well, I heard you whisper
To all your friends
I heard you telling them that
You need a man in whom
You can depend
Well I'd be the gasoline
To keep you alive
And I'd be the cold
So unbreakable
We'd burn together
Straight through the night
That's alright
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
Yeah, I'll hold you there
So close
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
Yeah, I'll hold you there
So close
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
