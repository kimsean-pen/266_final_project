We shall dance, we shall dance
The day we get a chance
To pay off all the violins of the ball

We shall dance, we shall dance
The day we get a chance
To get a dime to buy back our souls

We shall dance, we shall sing
My dear love, O my spring
My love good days will come
You'll see the corn will grow in spring
My spring time
My spring time

We shall dance, we shall dance
The day we get a chance
To pay off all the violins of the ball

We shall dance, we shall stay
With the children at play
Lord I swear when the time comes, we'll pray
We shall dance, we shall sing
my dear love, O my spring

My love you'll have a house
With roof and walls
Fire with coal
My soul, my soul

We shall dance, we shall dance
The day we get a chance
To pay off all the violins of the ball

We shall dance, we shall stay
With the children at play
Lord I swear when the time comes, we'll pray
