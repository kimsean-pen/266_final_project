Working, breeding
A hidden code inside
Tireless, effective
Integral part of the hive

We must control the masses
We have to rule their fears
We are the Will Divine
The Will Divine

Brainwaves, feelings
On programs we design
Clockwork empire
You are the prototype
Lunatic demigod
A faulty code inside
Lunatic demigod
The Prototype

From an artificial cell...
From an artificial human cell

Once you were sentient beings
Once you dared to live with laughs and tears
Now you are only human machines
Our humanoid toys that mimic living
