It's not easy

Baby now let me hold you tight my love
It's not easy
I want to hold you every day so that I can fall into your love arms
It's not easy
Darling you've made me lose my mind
It's not easy
I want to lose my mind every day so that I can fall into your love arms
It's not easy
Let me down now, I want to hold you every day
I will never, never let you go
Every day hey every day I love you so much
It's not easy

Darling you've made me lose my mind
It's not easy
I want to lose my mind every day so that I can fall into your thin arms
It's not easy
Let me down now I want to hold you every day never never let you go
Every day hey every day
It's not easy.
