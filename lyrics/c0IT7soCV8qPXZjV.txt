You were the child
Who was made out of glass
Who carried a black heart
Passed down from your dad

If somebody loved you,
They'd tell you by now
We all turn away when you're down

You want to go back
To where you felt safe
To hear your brother's laughter
See your mother's face

Your childhood home
Is just power white bone
And you'll never find
You're way back

And when you're gone
Will they say your name?
And when you're gone
Will they love you the same?
If not, that's okay
If not, that's okay

You are broken and callow
Cautious and safe
You are boundless in beauty
With fright in your face

Until someone loves you,
I'll keep you safe
But like then,
I will give you away

And when you're gone
Will they say your name?
And when you're gone
Will they love you the same?
If not, that's okay
If not, that's okay

And when you're gone
Will they say your name?
And when you're gone
Will they love you the same?

Oh,
When you're gone
We won't say a word
But you know,
That's okay.
Don't you know
That's okay?
