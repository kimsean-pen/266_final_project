They don't love you like I love you
I won't leave you in the dark
Look above you, I will love you
In the sunshine on the rock
I feel a cool breeze blowing through my beard
I roll the top down falling on my back
I hear your heartbeat pounding in my ears
Tasting candy running down my neck
There's a bright light, blinding white light
You're like lightning across the sky
Please don't leave me in total darkness
I'll bring you with me into the sunshine rock
We watch the fireworks in an open field
And stay so late we miss the train
We grab a taxi on the busy busy street
And race across the city once again
The moon is merely a reflection of the sun
Like other stars that seem so far away
I'll be your astronaut, you know we won't get caught
We're headed straight into the sunshine rock, oh yeah
The search to find a love that makes your life complete
Life is but a dance inside the power plant
So when the lights go down and people fade away
There is no second chance
There is no second chance
I'll reach into the sky, grab the nearest shooting star
We can end it all, right in my hand to you
I'll be your astronaut, you know we won't get caught
We're headed straight into the sunshine rock, oh yeah
