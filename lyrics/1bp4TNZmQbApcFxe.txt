Just give me your trust
Won't make it too tough
Ain't loving unless it's dangerous
Come bring it on me
Got something you need
I'll let you play out my fantasy
I got a red room of velvet
And I can let you in if you want, you want
In my red room of velvet
We can do anything that we want, we want, we want
That we want, we want
That we want, we want
That we want, we want
We want, we want
You fit in them jeans
They're velvet, like me
My skin's so soft, like sweet whipped cream
Good night gone bad
Just how it like that
Tie me to this bed, don't need no hands
I got a red room of velvet
And I can let you in if you want, you want
In my red room of velvet
We can do anything that we want, we want, we want
That we want, we want
That we want, we want
That we want, we want
We want, we want
What would you think if we did the unthinkable?
I'll let you touch if you touch the unreachable
You've never seen it 'cause I'm the original
I'm the original
I'm the original
I got a red room of velvet
And I can let you in if you want, you want
In my red room of velvet
We can do anything that we want, we want, we want
That we want, we want
That we want, we want
That we want, we want
We want, we want
