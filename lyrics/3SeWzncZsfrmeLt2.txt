In my dreams, time it seems, is pain without end*
Well I tried to find, a place to hide, my doubts about us

Now see it falls away,
We all become the same,
This stormy night
A fall from grace,
Yes, my fate,

Well into the fold, we are, we are, we are,
Too far to stop
I won't fall, we are, we are, we are,
Too far too stop

Tell me what I wanna hear, and I'll take you anywhere
That you wanna go, I'll take you there

Were already gone,
Forget, regret about, mistakes I made
I still feel her... still

Well into the fold, we are, we are, we are,
Too far to stop
I won't fall, we are, we are, we are,
Too far too stop

Wake up, what if you took my word, what this stood for, girl,

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,

Well into the fold, we are, we are, we are,
Too far to stop
I won't fall, we are, we are, we are,
Too far too stop
