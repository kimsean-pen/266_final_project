So sorry for the trouble
The times we've been afraid of each other
'Cause we didn't understand
All the spells we cast without trying
We pushed through

Ship wrecking my life
Sorry stained my mouth gumball blue

Their damp bodies crammed in Times Square
I logged the furious path one hinted
To a hotel with no one waiting
But me and me and my whole' life
A fever and the phone

How was I to know
Sorry stained my mouth gumball blue

When the strangers say I love you
You're banished to a planet with no sounds
No sounds (no sounds)

But you come back for me
Sometimes only for your own peace of mind
Sometimes where there's smoke
It's just a smoke machine, honey
Honey

I've lived singing your songs
Long-legged mazes and English tea on a tree
They will not consider we were here
Should we break spells without trying?

We cut our lasers short at crying
And kindly banish
The soundless planet
Stain the edges of the nebula gumball blue

Another happy new year
Another happy new year
Another happy new year
Another happy new year
Another happy new year
Another happy new year
