Here it comes
Shoots out his mouth
Like wild fire across a field
One by one
I watch the slick red wounds reveal

And I shut down and try not to feel
But I am cut now, can't seem to heal

I hear you saying that it's time to go
But I am begging you to take it slow
Can't you see I'm trying not to lose control
Of everything I know

For so long, I swore I would never need you near
As we're undone, I feel that faith disappear

Oh and I shut down, no more to say
And I, I should have guessed you'd be this way

I hear you saying that it's time to go
But I am begging you to take it slow
Can't you see I'm trying not to lose control
Oh, I'm trying not to lose control
Oh, I'm trying not to lose control
Oh, I'm trying not to lose control

Don't let me go home tonight, don't let me near real life
I see I won't change your mind, but I still want to stay the night
Don't make me go home tonight, don't let me near real life
I see I won't change your mind, but I still want to stay the night
Don't let me go home tonight, don't let me near real life
I see I won't change your mind, but I still want to stay the night
Don't let me go home tonight, don't let me near real life
I see I won't change your mind, but I still want to stay the night
