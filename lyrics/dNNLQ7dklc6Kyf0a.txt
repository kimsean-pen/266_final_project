Summer nights and long warm days
Are stolen as the old moon falls
And my mirror shows another face
Another place to hide it all
Another place to hide it all

And I'm lost, behind
The words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As the seasons roll on by

Sleeping with a full moon blanket
Sand and feathers for my head
Dreams have never been the answer
And dreams have never made my bed
Dreams have never made my bed

And I'm lost, behind
The words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As the seasons roll on by
Woohoo

Now I want to fly above the storm
But you can't grow feathers in the rain
And the naked floor is cold as hell
This naked floor reminds me
Oh the naked floor reminds me

That I'm lost, behind
The words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As the seasons roll on by yeah

If I should be short on words
And long on things to say
Could you crawl into my world
And take me worlds away
Should I be beside myself
And not even stay
Woohoo

And I'm lost, behind
The words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As the seasons roll on by yeah
