The moral of a story never meant a lot to me
I've fooled around but can't get down with most philosophy
Buddha and the Pope sing a lovely note
Take my soul to where it wants to go
Hendrix and Marley always do it right for me.

If I had one religion
It would surely be a love song in the distance, a soft melody
If I had one request granted after I'm gone
I would ask my creator to turn the radio on
Turn the radio on.

Oooh, oooh

Been to the mountains, seen the valleys, seen the holy land too
But ain't no preacher like Aretha when I'm feeling real blue
Buddha and the Pope sing a lovely note
Take my soul to where it wants to go
Lennon and the chief always do it right for me

If I had one religion
It would surely be a love song in the distance, a soft melody
If I had one request granted after I'm gone
I would ask my creator to turn the radio on
Turn the radio on.
