Bent again I glimpse a past that I know never was still I see,
reminiscence. Pulsate, breathing, starring through me.
Something I can't recollect speaks my mind, all thou I shun it's
sometimes there. Binding, gazing, intentions seems unknown.

Flashes conceived so bizzare rid them of my mind. Scenery of
filth, eyeless faces, lights of the looming black, abject lash by
lash. Striking my flesh without leaving marks. Scenery of filth,
eyeless faces, lights of the looming black, abject lash by lash.

My presence slowly fades with bitter taste and wings that can not
bear. Lost, I wonder in its reek, it stirs my mind, wreck my being.
The more I deny, it gets all clearer.

The air is so thick, soggy surroundings, hard to breach, watching
it as through a facet Bewildering clatter, a spectral resonance,
although I can't touch it I feel it all over me.

A spewing shine, I have begotten this appalling view. As it is less
of forms, the rapid shifting of shapres and moulds. Intangible,
scent of the reviled.

The rain of black flakes never seem to hit the pallid soil on which
I'm placed. This trance exhibit of forbidden silhouettes. As
shadows I see them twirling by my side, ever foes of life Chained
and bleeding, locked from fleeing, lash by lash.

holds me, motions ebb through me. The rotten ambience is gone
as I wait for the call to wake up Eyes closed, I wither,
the journey back I seek
