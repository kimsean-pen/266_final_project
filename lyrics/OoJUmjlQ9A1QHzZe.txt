Whatever you're searching for
You won't find it here
But I'll admit something keeps pulling me back into your atmosphere
I'm really good at mistakes
All the marks I left on the page
They seem to never wanna disappear
Why do you still come around?
When all I do is push, push, push you away
I really really wanna take a chance on you but I
I hesitate

I'm afraid to start
Don't wanna break your heart
Just finished picking up the pieces from this mess
I never meant to hurt nobody
But now I tend to move slowly
Cause if I ever slip from your fingertips

My name would be stained on your lips

It feels like everybody's watching
To see what my next move is
Do I proceed with caution
Or do I just dive in?
But I'm fine with taking it slow
Enjoy life on my own
But I can be confusing sometimes, I know
I'm surprised you're still around
Baby all I do is push, push, push you away
I really really wanna take a chance on you but I

I need to make sure
This isn't just a phase

I'm afraid to start
Don't wanna break your heart
Just finished picking up the pieces from this mess
I never meant to hurt nobody

But now I tend to move slowly
Cause if I ever slip from your fingertips
My name would be stained on your lips

Nothing wrong with taking my time with love
I don't wanna be the bad guy again
I don't wanna be the bad guy again
Still working up the kinks in my tainted love
Colors bleed out from my heart to his
Different shades that I can't I predict
Nothing wrong with taking my time with love
