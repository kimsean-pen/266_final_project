So you
Can't hold
A star
In your
Hand though
At least you can
Hold on
To another plan

Rusted wheel
Planted still

I can
Tell it's
Summer
From the, yeah
Size of
The bugs that fly
Through my window
Flying through my window

Rusted wheel
Planted still
Rusted wheel
Can't move on

I can
Tell it's
Winter
From the
Size of
The lump in
My throat
I got a lump in my throat

Rusted wheel
Planted still
Rusted wheel
Can't move on

And it feels
Just like the ground
But trapped in another way
Just still in the ground

And it feels
Just like the ground
The ground
And trapped in another way
Just still in the ground
The ground
The ground

So you can't hold
A star in your, yeah
Hand though
At least you can
Move on
To that better plan
Right now
Rusted wheel
Planted still
Rusted wheel
Can't move on

Rusted wheel
Planted still
Rusted wheel
Planted still
Rusted wheel
Planted still
Rusted wheel
Can't move on
