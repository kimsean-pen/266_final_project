Everything you've ever begged me to be
Could never have meant any less to me
Everything you've ever asked me to say
It's so far away from the truth
So far away from the truth
So far away

Fake messiah
Stitches sewn in your eyes
Fake messiah
Prophecy now denied

Over and over and ever again
Defending your insignificance
Useless intent hidden behind your mask
A coward's voice... Anonymous
So far away from the truth
So far away

Fake messiah
Stitches sewn in your eyes
Fake messiah
Prophecy now denied
Fake messiah
Open mouth, drawing flies
Fake messiah
Prophecy now denied
Denied

Generation failure
Suspended in irrelevance
Slit you wide open
Just to see what you're made of
Just to see what you're made of

So far away from the truth

Fake messiah
Stitches sewn in your eyes
Fake messiah
Prophecy now denied
Fake messiah
Open mouth, drawing flies
Fake messiah
Prophecy now denied

Messiah...
Fake...
Messiah...
Fake messiah...
