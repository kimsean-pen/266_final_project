(For so many years I tried to complete what I once started
But, something was always here.
Hiding away from me
Kept me from making it happen,
it's so unreal
The clock is ticking, the time is passing me by, passing me by)

Everywhere, all that is there
(No reason to show them all what I am who I am what I think)

Answer me for all that I.m asking
Taking back what I've been missing
Looking back making me stronger
My despair makes me live longer
(My despair)

(So we think, got of my escape out from your prison
I am was, out of myself. Strike as I never
Killing for free now I am safe, nothing, I gotta fight out of here
Fewer then me, ripping me like out I ever escaped now)

Everywhere, all that is there,
(No reason to show them all what I am who I am what I think)

Answer me for all that I.m asking
Taking back what I've been missing
Looking back making me stronger
My despair makes me live longer

Everywhere, all that is there
Everywhere, all that is there
Answer me for all that I.m asking
Taking back what I've been missing
Looking back making me stronger (Stronger)
My despair makes me live longe
