He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh ohhh
He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh oh
Girl don't play the fool--no

You're the one givin' up the love
Anytime he needs it
But you turn your back and then he's off
and runnin' with the crowd

You're the one to sacrifice
Anything to please him
Do you really think he thinks about you
when he's out

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh ohhh
He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh oh oh
Girl don't play the fool--no

It was only late last night
He was out there sneakin'
Then he called you up to check that you
were waiting by the phone

All the world's a candy store
He's been trick or treatin'
When it comes to true love girl with him
there's no one home

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh ohh
He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh oh oh
Girl don't play the fool--no

You could find somebody better girl
He could only make you cry
You deserve somebody better girl
He's c-cold as ice
Stay away from him girl
C-c-c-cold hearted

Ah ah
C-c-c-cold hearted snake
C-c-c-cold hearted
Ah ah
C-c-c-cold hearted snake
He's a cold-hearted snake

Look into his eyes
Oh ohhhh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules

Oh oh

Girl don't play the fool--no
Oh ah
Look into his eyes
Oh ah

He's been telling lies
Oh ah
He don't play by rules
Oh ah
Girl don't play the fool
He's a cold hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh oh
He's been telling lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh oh
Girl don't play the fool
He's a cold hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh oh
He's been telling lies
