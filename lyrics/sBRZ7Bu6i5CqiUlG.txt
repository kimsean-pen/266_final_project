all around you
elevated higher nature
go young don't fade
can't nobody pin you down
liberating solids into vapors
new dawn all day
no baggage you haul around

you don't wanna be nobody's savior
you break away
and move to the higher ground
dialating iris in the chamber
wheels on display
go round in the holy house

all around you
you keep it natural
all around you
body electrical
All around you
You keep it natural
All around you

take away your names and your labels
don't leave no trace
can't nobody pin you down
all you see is angels in the angles
no guilt no shame
no baggage you haul around
you don't wanna be nobody's savior
you break away
and move to the higher ground
dilating iris in the chamber
wheels on display
go round in the holy house

all around you
you keep it natural
all around you
body electrical

skies spiral on higher
all wide open every road
fuse has finally caught on fire
all electric in the cold

why visit to another world?
why listen to a primal urge?
must i mention why?

why listen when it can't be heard?
why look when you cannot observe?
must i mention why?
