Baby
I fucked half the boys in Paris
And in New York, so embarrassed
'Cause I need my one

Darling
I woke up in Austin, Texas
I did decline to stay for breakfast
'Cause I need my one

My one
My one
My number one
My one
My one
My number one

Honey
I had a suitor in Vancouver
I put that loser in an Uber
'Cause he's not my one

Pumpkin
I picked something up in Sydney
Now the voice inside my kidneys
Says I need my one

My one
My one
My number one
My number one
My number one

Petal
Things in Gothenberg came undone
So I'm heading back to London
For to see my one

My one
My one
My one
My one
My number one
My number one

My number one
My number one
My number one
My number one
My number one
My number one
My number one
My number one
