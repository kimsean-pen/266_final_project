I haven't felt this type of thang in a while
I thought I Iost myself in love until I found you

I can't predict my fate but I can't be his no more
Oooh, two years enough, few days
But my week with you means more, oooh

I'm quickly fallin' and it feels natural
I'm quickly fallin' and it feels natural

I haven't felt these butterflies
since I don't even know
Nobody really knows my name
Because all you call me is beautiful

I can't predict my fate
But I can't be his no more
Oooh, two years enough, few days
But my week with you means more, oooh

I'm quickly fallin' and it feels natural
I'm quickly fallin' and it feels natural
