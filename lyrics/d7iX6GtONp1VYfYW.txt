I know this
Won't make sense
There's a thing
That I miss

As of now
I'm in bliss
Wandering
The abyss

I know that I've made you hurt
Your words devour what I'm worth
Forgive my faults, in return
I will not cry, I will learn

Meaningless
Attention
Shows you're weak
Purposely

Hold your tongue
As my knife
Will decide
Who was right

I know that I've made you hurt
Your words devour what I'm worth
Forgive my faults, in return
I will not cry, I will learn
