Primal nature shifts
Our nervousness (?)
As the old friend tell (?)
A new one is taking grip

In all of us lies secrets
Hidden inside hollow hearts
Heaven was built by heathens
There's no place for us, never was

All seeing eyes won't let us see
Truth and purpose is meant to sting
When the pain strikes we crash to our knees
This is the eve of everything
This is the eve of everything
This is the eve of everything

I need to forget and to move on
I need to feel loss to cherish love

In all of us lies secrets
Hidden inside hollow hearts
Heaven was built by heathens
There's no place for us, never was

When the pain strikes we crash to our knees
This is the eve of everything
This is the eve of everything
This is the eve of everything

I need to forget and to move on
I need to feel loss to cherish love
I need to face fear without a pause
I need to fall to learn to stand up

In all of us lies secrets
Hidden inside hollow hearts
Heaven was built by heathens
There's no place for us, never was

All seeing eyes won't let us see
Truth and purpose is meant to sting
When the pain strikes we crash to our knees
This is the eve of everything
All seeing eyes won't let us see
Truth and purpose is meant to sting
When the pain strikes we crash to our knees
This is the eve of everything
This is the eve of everything
