Yes sir

Well, the bigger the city, well, the brighter the lights
The bigger the dog, well, the harder the bite
I don't know where you been last night
But I think Mama, you ain't doin' right

Say I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little 'bout it
I know a little 'bout love
And Baby I can guess the rest

Well, now I don't read that daily news
'Cause it ain't hard to figure where people gets the blues
They can't dig what they can't use
If they stick to themself they'd be much less abused

Say I know a little
Lord, I do know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little 'bout it
I know a little 'bout love
And Baby I can guess the rest

Play me a little
Whoa, yeah
Yeah

Well, now you want me to be your only man
Said listen up Mama, teach you all I can
Do right Baby by your man
Don't worry Mama, teach you all I can

Say I know a little
Lord, I know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little 'bout it
I know a little 'bout love
And Baby I can guess the rest

Well, I know a little 'bout love
Baby I want your best
