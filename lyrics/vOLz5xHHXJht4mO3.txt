The pain's instinctual;
I might be be trained but I just won't dig you up.
The scale is temporal;
I have the spade but I just won't dig you up.

You buried yourself in acid soil, and bones dissolve.

We were waiting for the stones to fall, and cities crumble,
while you buried yourself in acid soil, and bones dissolve.

All this time we were dreaming, and all this time we were numb,
while I was digging a hole I could sleep in.
Digging a hole just for fun.

We were waiting for the stones to fall.

All this time you're complacent, and all this time you have gained,
while I was digging a hole I could sleep in
to swallow the taste of the rain.

We were waiting for the stones to fall, and cities crumble
while you buried yourself in acid soil, and bones dissolve.
You sought to own and have it all, but the future's gone
because you buried yourself in acid soil, and bones dissolve.
