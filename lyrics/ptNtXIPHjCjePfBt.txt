We're dreaming, we're dreaming, we're dreaming away,
We're sleeping, we're sleeping, we sleep in all day.
Still you moan and you moan though I've heard it all before,
how we're poorer than poor today.

And you grumble and groan no one gets rich any more,
Though I don't really
Mind OK.
Is it really that bad? Is it really that bad?
You tell me, tell me.

Oooh, Yeah man, I know that you are broke 'cause I'm broke,
let's be broke
Together. What you say man?

We're eating, we're eating, we're eating aren't we?
The sweetest, greasiest food, feasting away.
And we'll never get fat 'cause we jump around like prats, getting drunk,
Getting away with it.
And we do what we want, don't answer to anyone,
every night and getting
Paid for it.

Oooh, Yeah man, I know that you are broke 'cause I'm broke,
let's be broke
Together. What you say man?
Oooh, Yeah man, I know that you are broke and I'm broke,
let's be broken
Men together, Yeah man.

Still you moan and you moan though I've heard it all before, how we're
Poorer than poor today.
And you grumble and groan no one gets rich any more,
Though I don't really
Mind OK.

Is it really that bad? Is it really that bad?
Say there's a way to change your mind.
Is it really that bad? Has it really got that bad?
You tell me, tell me.

Oooh, Yeah man, I know that you are broke 'cause I'm broke,
let's be broke
Together. What you say man?
Oooh, Yeah man, I know that you are broke and I'm broke
let's be broken men together,
Yeah man,
yeah man.
