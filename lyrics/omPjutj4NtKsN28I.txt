(Oh you left me with a broken heart
And now I see what I shoulda from the start
Yeah you left me with nothing but a kiss
And now I'm leaving you with these lips
With these lips, oh)

Everything looked fine from here
Everything looked more than clear
But now you're gone and I'm still here
(Yeah, check it out)
So check it out (so check it out)
I wrote it down (I wrote it down)
In case you ever left this town
And baby, you can't fire me (no way)
'Cause I quit
Right now

Oh you left me with a broken heart
And now I see what I shoulda from the start
Yeah you left me with nothing but a kiss
And now I'm leaving you with these lips

Whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa

(Baby, baby)
Whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa
(You left me)
Whoa, whoa
(You left me)
(Baby, baby)

Listen up,
So now I'm pressin'
But I ain't stressin'
She's got a man (she's got a man)
I'm with her best friend
Tried at love but it never really stuck
She said she loved me
But I didn't give fu--

Oh you left me with a broken heart
And now I see what I shoulda from the start
Yeah you left me with nothing but a kiss
And now I'm leaving you with these lips

Whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa

(Baby, baby)
Whoa, whoa

(Baby, baby)

(You left me, you left me, baby)

And now I'm better 'cause you left me (you left me)
I just left 'cause you let me (you let me)
Don't keep callin', just forget me (baby)
Don't keep callin', just
Just forget...

Oh you left me with a broken heart
And now I see what I shoulda from the start
Yeah you left me with nothing but a kiss
And now I'm leaving you with these lips
