Loving you
Has gotta be
The hardest thing
All my lies are true
When I'm loving you
Understand you
Gotta learn
To hold my hand
Do everything I do
When I'm loving you

We are sunlight
We burn so bright
Like California
You and the moon
Are gone too soon
I fall like a star
You weren't free
Baby u belong to me
I make u
Feel brand new
When I'm loving you

We are so light
We are so bright
Like California
You and the moon
Are gone too soon
I fall like a star

Loving you
Has gotta be
The hardest thing
All my lies are true
When I'm loving you
Love, love
Loving you
Loving you
