I was in the future yesterday
But it looked nothing like this
It was a shot I never missed
It was a lover I never had

I was in the future yesterday
But now I'm in the past
And it keeps taking me back
Like a decision I want to come and solve

Time machine's came
We are unfortunate when it rain in your head
Time machine's came
We are unfortunate when it rain in your head
Never can tell
Where the time machine's going to land
Never can tell
Where the time's machine's going to.

I was in the future yesterday
But it looked nothing like this
It was a lover i never kissed
I was in the future yesterday
But now I'm in the past
And it keeps taking me back

Time machine's came
We are unfortunate when it rain in your head
Time machine's came
We are unfortunate when it rain in your head
Never can tell
Where the time machine's going to land
Never can tell
Where the time machine's going to...

I was in the future yesterday
I was in the future yesterday
I was in the future yesterday
I was in the future yesterday
I was in the future yesterday
I was in the future yesterday
I was in the future yesterday...
