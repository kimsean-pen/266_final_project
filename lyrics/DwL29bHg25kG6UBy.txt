I tried to write a song about you, to take you down
But you know where I am is what you hate about me now
I've heard the things you've said, calling yourself my ex-boyfriend
To anyone who would listen, so what's this about?

Cause you used to call me pretty til you took out the r
Said "girl you couldn't be more petty than you already are"
Are you mad cause I wrote songs about you breaking my heart?
Cause boy you used to call me pretty til you took out the r
I'm singin' like
I'm singin' like

Thought we were cool until I saw you take me off your phone
It's been so long, you've still not moved out of your parents' home
Don't wanna see me now, but you're so happy goin' round
Recalling how we screwed around, now you're all on your own

Cause you used to call me pretty til you took out the r
Said "girl you couldn't be more petty than you already are"
Are you mad cause I wrote songs about you breaking my heart?
Cause boy you used to call me pretty til you took out the r
I'm singin' like
I'm singin' like
I'm singin' like

Baby, you're welcome, for the press shots and the parties
That my name will get you into when I play this song about you
And you know that I don't hate you, though I've got reason to
Cause boy I miss your mother's dinners more than I miss you
I'm singin' like
I'm singin' like
