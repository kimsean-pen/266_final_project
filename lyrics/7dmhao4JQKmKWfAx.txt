This life I live like, baby don't drink like
Baby don't think too much, don't drive
I got here, I can't even...

This life I live like, baby don't drink like
Baby don't think too much, don't drive
I got here, I can't even tell my nigga
Ain't a damn thing parked outside
Size of my cup, nigga I'm Gucci
Sides of my hair, nigga I'm Boosie
Nigga burnt out, can't even catch fire no more
Figured it was just a West Side movie

But thank God I got my bank, where I keep my heart inside
And I keep it far away from all these hoes and flashin' lights
I'm like Remy with the whip, I'm not Oprah with these hoes
And I keep a snoopy broad because it keep me on my toes
We been ridin' for ten exits and I still been in your door
We get better by the steps so if I ever let you go
Baby you classy, baby you got it
Baby you ain't really 'spossed to do the whole thing
Bitch too smart, got lost just fuckin' with a nigga
Got tossed cause a nigga couldn't think

This life I live like, baby don't drink like
Baby don't think too much, don't drive
I got here, I can't even tell my nigga
Ain't a damn thing parked outside
Size of my cup, nigga I'm Gucci
Size of my hair, nigga I'm Boosie
Nigga burnt out, can't even catch fire no more
Figured it was just a West Side movie

I was billin' in the back, I was chillin' in the back
Cause I always really wanna be that nigga in the back
You don't live it really, I can show you how to live
But I promise I can show a pussy nigga how to act
Junked out smokin' from the side door
With a bitch I wanted in the eighth grade
Hope you got an ass like Nori
Hope you pussy niggas never see me
This is why I never wanna feed ya
Cause I can tell you bitches got a limit
I can be subjective 'bout you fuckin' up the highway
You fuckin' up the ride, why you fuckin' up the heist?
I remember lookin' from the outside
I remember workin' up the work day
I remember nigga havin' nothin' but my momma
And some starter on my mothafuckin' birthday, birthday
Baby can I live it like a body?
Let my momma smoke it 'til she finish
Let a nigga sip it all alone babe
It's been a long day, I'm in a high 10:30
All my niggas tell me that they want it
Hope I see my niggas at the finish
Let a nigga sip it all alone babe
It's been a long day, I'm in a high 10:30

This life I live like, baby don't drink like
Baby don't think too much, don't drive
I got here, I can't even tell my nigga
Ain't a damn thing parked outside
Size of my cup, nigga I'm Gucci
Size of my hair, nigga I'm Boosie
Nigga burnt out, can't even catch fire no more
Figured it was just a West Side movie

But thank God I got my bank, where I keep my heart inside
And I keep it far away from all these hoes and flashin' lights
I'm like Remy with the whip, I'm not Oprah with these hoes
And I keep a snoopy broad because it keep me on my toes

This life I live like, baby don't drink like
Baby don't think too much, don't drive
I got here, I can't even tell my nigga
Ain't a damn thing parked outside
Size of my cup, nigga I'm Gucci
Size of my hair, nigga I'm Boosie
Nigga burnt out, can't even catch fire no more
Figured it was just a West Side movie
