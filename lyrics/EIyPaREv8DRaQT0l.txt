When the wind picked up the fire spread
And the grapevines seemed left for dead.
And the northern sky, like the end of day,
The end of days.

A wake up call to a rented room
Sounded like an alarm of impending doom.
To warn us it's only a matter of time.
Before we all burn [4x]

We bought some wine and some papercups
Near your daughter's school when we picked her up
And drove to a cemetery on a hill
On a hill.

And we watched the plumes paint the sky gray
And she laughed and danced through the field of graves
There I knew it would be alright
That everything would be alright,
Would be alright
Would be alright
Would be alright.

And the news reports on the radio
Said it was getting worse
As the ocean air fanned the flame.
But I couldn't think of anywhere I would have rather been
To watch it all burn away.
To burn away.

The firemen worked in double shifts,
With prayers for rain on their lips
And they knew it was only a matter of time.
