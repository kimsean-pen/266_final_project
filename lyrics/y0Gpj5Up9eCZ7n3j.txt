I'm not embarrassed to admit that
I need your physicality
Every human becomes weak

Touch me where I'm hurting
Hold me when I don't belong
Kiss away my confusion
Kiss it away, kiss it away
Kiss it away, kiss it away

You have my permission to do
All that you want to do
Come destroy my fragility

Touch me where I'm hurting
Hold me when I don't belong
Kiss away my confusion
Kiss it away, kiss it away
Kiss it away, kiss it away

This dull sadness
So goddamn stubborn
I can't take it anymore
Your body
So shocking
Lay me down
On the floor
On the floor

Touch me where I'm hurting
Hold me when I don't belong
Kiss away my confusion
Kiss it away, kiss it away
Kiss it away, kiss it away

Kiss it away
Kiss it away
