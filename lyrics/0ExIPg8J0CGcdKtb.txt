Don't know what I did to make you feel that way
I can't always say just what I want to say
Out of place again, you're on my case again
Bringing up the past and sling it in my face again

Put me in the frame, so even if I win, I lose
Going down slow ain't the only way to go
Listen to me, honey, tell you something funny
Miss me when I'm gone, you'll be the one to sing the blues

Seems to me the good times ended way to soon
Seems like faded echoes in an empty room
Strangers in the night, strangers in the light
Seems like every word we say just makes us scratch and bite

We thought we had the answers, we were sure we couldn't lose
What you want with me is all the things that I can't be
Listen to me baby, I'm beginning to go crazy
Miss me when I'm gone, you'll be the one to sing the blues

More I think about it, it's a goddamn shame
Opposites attract 'til they become the same
Daggers in our eyes, time to say goodbye
Time to stop pretending, time to stop the endless lies

I wish you luck, babe, I hope you find a dream and it comes true
What my eyes can't see don't make no difference to me
Listen to me faking, though my heart is breaking
Miss you now you're gone, now I'm the one to sing the blues
