Thieves, thieves and liars, murderers
Hypocrites and bastards
In laughter (Get up!)

(Get up! Get on your feet!)
Hey, thanks for nothing!
Morals in the dust (morals in the dust)
Two-faced (two-faced) bastards and sycophants
No trust

(We are fighting for the liberation of minds, not for the liberation of this pig, and racist society)
Drag on

Thieves! Liars!
Thieves! Liars!
Thieves! Liars!
Thieves! Liars!
Inside, outside, which side, you don't know
My side, your side, their side, we don't know

Which side are they? Which side are they?
Which side of their mouth do you suppose that it came?
Which side are they? Which side are they?
Which side of the grass is greener?

Inside, outside, which side, you don't know
My side, your side, their side, we don't know

You're like a great big fucking gun
Just waiting to get squeezed!

(We're gonna rip this motherfucker off
We're gonna tear this motherfucker down)

Huh
Hey
Huh
(Get up!)

(Get up! Get on your feet!)
Breathe, forfeit erection!
Toxical injection
Geriatric fuck-fest
We still believe in lies
(I hope they realize that this is their last goddamn chance)
(Kill him!)
(Kill, kill, kill)
Drag on

Thieves! Liars!
Thieves! Liars!
Thieves! Liars!
Thieves! Liars!
Inside, outside, which side, we don't know
My side, your side, their side, we don't know
Which side are they? Which side are they?
Which side of their mouth do you suppose that it came?
Which side are they? Which side are they?
Which side of the grass is greener?
Inside, outside, which side, you don't know
My side, your side, their side, no one knows

You're like a great big hit of acid
Waiting to be taken!

(Power to the people)
(Power to the people)
(Police officer!)
(You will not kill!)

(I want peace)

(Do you want peace?)

(I can't hear you!)

(I still can't hear you!)
