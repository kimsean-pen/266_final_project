One more time before I close my eyes
My shadow self will get another life?
I don't think so, and Hell is empty

The devils here, the devils here
The devils here are vast and plenty
The Devil's here, the Devil's here
The Devil's here, and we're all gonna

D.I.E

D.I.E
We're all gonna die, we're all gonna die, we're all gonna

Will the sky give way? Will life let me be?

The devils here, the devils here
The devils here are vast and plenty
The Devil's here, the Devil's here
The Devil's here, and we're all gonna
