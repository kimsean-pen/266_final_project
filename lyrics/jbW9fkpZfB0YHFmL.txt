Don't speak of safe Messiahs
A failure of the Modern Man
To the centre of all life's desires
As a whole not an also ran
Love in a hollow field
Break the image of your father's son
Drawn to an inner feel
He was thought of as the only one
He was thought of as the only one

He no longer denies
All the failures of the Modern Man
No, no, no, he can't pick sides
Sees the failures of the Modern Man
Wise words and sympathy
Tell the story of our history
New strength gives a real touch
Sense and reason make it all too much
With a strange fatality
Broke the spirits of a lesser man
Some other race can see
In his way he was the only one
In his way he was the only one

He no longer denies
All the failures of the Modern Man
No, no, no, he can't pick sides
Sees the failures of the Modern Man
Now that it's time to decide
In his time he was a total man
Taken from Caesar's side
Kept in silence just to prove who's wrong
He no longer denies
All the failures of the Modern Man
No, no, no, he can't pick sides
Sees the failures of the Modern Man
All the failures of the Modern Man
