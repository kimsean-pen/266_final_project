You took me to your favourite place on earth
To see the tree they cut down ten years from your birth
Our fingers traced in circles round its history
We brushed our hands right back in time through century

As you held me down
You said

"I'll see you in the future when we're older
And we are full of stories to be told
Cross my heart and hope to die
I'll see you with your laughter lines"

Changes on our hands and on our faces
Oh oh, memories are mapped out by the lines we'll trace

As you held me down
You said

"I'll see you in the future when we're older
And we are full of stories to be told
Cross my heart and hope to die
I'll see you with your laughter lines"

Ashen faces in cool breeze
Ashen faces in cool breeze
Armed with stories you will leave
Oh oh, armed with stories you will leave

I'll see you in the future when we're older
And we are full of stories to be told
Cross my heart and hope to die
I'll see you with your laughter lines

I'll see you in the future when we're old
I'll see you in the future when we're old
