When routine bites hard
and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high
but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways
taking different roads
Love, love will tear us apart again

Why is this bedroom so cold?
You turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed?
Our respect runs so dry
Yet there's still this appeal
that we've kept through our lives
Love, love will tear it apart again
Love, love will tear it apart again

You cry out in your sleep
All my feelings exposed
And there's a taste in my mouth
as desperation takes hold
Yet, that something's so good
Just can't function no more, when
love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Oh, love, love will tear us apart again
