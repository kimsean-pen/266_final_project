the heat came down and breathing got clear
there was water in your hair
and the sun came out, we had to get back in
the fog burned off and finally i felt near
sunlight made reflections on your skin
to the place i like to stay but the year went on and it got too cold to swim
so i stayed beneath as the water above me froze
from under the ice i saw you in warm clothes
and now i'm thawing out while the fire you made grows
