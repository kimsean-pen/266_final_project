FUBAR, who are you?
I used to know someone who looked like you
FUBAR, what's wrong with you?
You cause so many people to suffer for you

F.U.B.A.R., FUBAR
F.U.B.A.R., FUBAR
F.U.B.A.R., FUBAR
F.U.B.A.R., FUBAR

You're fucked up
You're fucked up

FUBAR, you're doing time
The way you treat yourself is such a crime
FUBAR, you're outta luck
What were you thinking 'bout, you stupid fuck?

F.U.B.A.R., FUBAR
F.U.B.A.R., FUBAR
F.U.B.A.R., FUBAR
F.U.B.A.R., FUBAR

FUBAR, now there's no doubt, no doubt
You turned into what you were warned about, warned about
FUBAR, you could have been, could have been
Something real special will it ever end?

FUBAR, now it's too late
You cursed yourself to a dreadful fate
FUBAR, rest in peace
I wonder which one of us died the least

F.U.B.A.R., FUBAR
F.U.B.A.R., FUBAR
F.U.B.A.R., FUBAR
F.U.B.A.R., FUBAR

FUBAR, you're fucked up
FUBAR, you're fucked up
FUBAR, you're fucked up
FUBAR, beyond all recognition
And that's your condition

FUBAR, you're fucked up
FUBAR, you're fucked up
FUBAR, you're fucked up
F.U.B.A.R., beyond all recognition

FUBAR, and that's your condition, fucked up!
