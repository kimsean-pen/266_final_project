My friends from high school
Married their high school boyfriends
Moved into houses
In the same ZIP codes where their parents live
But I
I could never follow

No I
I could never follow
I hit the highway
In a pink RV with stars on the ceiling

Lived like a gypsy
Six strong hands on the steering wheel
I've been a long time gone now
Maybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down
But I've always found my way somehow
By takin' the long way
Takin' the long way around

Takin' the long way
Takin' the long way around
I met the queen of whatever
Drank with the Irish and smoked with the hippies
Moved with the shakers
Wouldn't kiss all the asses that they told me to

No I
I could never follow
No I
I could never follow
It's been two long years now
Since the top of the world came crashing down
And I'm gettin' it back on the road now

But I'm takin' the long way
Takin' the long way around

I'm takin' the long way
Takin' the long way around
I'll just take my time, I won't lay down (the long)
And take long way around (the long)
Well, I fought with a stranger and I met myself
I opened my mouth and I heard myself

It can get pretty lonely when you show yourself
Guess, I could've made it easier on myself
But I
I could never follow
No I
I could never follow
Well, I never seem to do it like anybody else
Maybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down
If you ever want to find me I can still be found
Takin' the long way
Takin' the long way around
Takin' the long way
Takin' the long way around
I'm takin' the long way
Takin' the long way around
I'm takin' the long way
Takin' the long way around
I'm takin' the long way
Takin' the long way around
Takin' the long way
Takin' the long way around
