Baby
You are the one
I can feel it inside my bones
Maybe
In the long run
You'll finally feel it's so
You say you don't know
If you honestly want my love

I'm gonna hunt until I get you
And when I get you I will love you
I will hold you, satisfy you
You'll never wanna let me go

I'm gonna kick them out of my way
I'm gonna find us a place to stay
You will love me, satisfy me
I'm gonna win this little game 6-0

Baby
There are boys
Who bring all the roses to you
And them
Sweet toy-boys
Who sweat with their abs, that's cool
Honey-babe
Can't you see
There's so much more in me

I'm gonna hunt until I get you
And when I get you I will love you
I will hold you, satisfy you
You'll never wanna let me go

I'm gonna kick them out of my way
I'm gonna find us a place to stay
You will love me, satisfy me
I'll win our l√Øttle game 6-0
