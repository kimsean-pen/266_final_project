In my memory
All the small things
Like daggers in my mind
In my memory
While my head bleeds
The words I'll never find
That I always meant to say to you I can't

'Cause you turned your face
And now I can't feel you anymore
Turn your face
So now I can't see you anymore
Walk away
Until you're not standing at my door
Turn your face, walk away and stay
Turn your face, oh, oh

In my memory
I was hurting
Long before we met, oh
In my memory
They're still burning
Fingerprints you left
And I always meant to say to you I can't

So just turn your face
Until I can't see you anymore
Turn your face
Until I can't see you anymore
Walk away
Until you're not standing at my door
Turn your face, walk away and stay
Turn your face

Each time I take you back
You bring one thousand cracks
And I accept them like a fool, ooh
So now what's your excuse?
What do we have to lose?
Since I'm already losing you

So hard to face
That I can't feel you anymore
Hard to face
That I can't see you anymore
So walk away
Until you're not standing at my door
Turn your face, walk away and stay
Turn your face
Turn your face and stay
Turn your face
