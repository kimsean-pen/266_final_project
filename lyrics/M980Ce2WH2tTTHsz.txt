Do you sleep all alone
Do you sleep to forget
Long past overdue
That love once knew

Yeah, it was from the streets, you came to a door
It hurt for long like never before
Poisoned your heart, burned down your cheeks
Forever more love don't speak

You, you hit me, I'm down
You, you hit me, I'm down

Yeah, you ran right back when you ran away
You act by night, you try by day
Poisoned your heart, burned down your cheeks
Forever more love don't speak

You, you hit me when I'm down
You, you hit me when I'm down
You, you hit me when I'm down
You, you hit me when I'm down

You, you hit me when I'm down
You, you hit me when I'm down
You, you hit me when I'm down
You, you hit me when I'm down

You, you hit me when I'm down
You, you hit me when I'm down
You, you hit me when I'm down
You, you hit me when I'm down

You hit me when I'm down
You hit me when I'm down
You hit me when I'm down
You hit me when I'm down
