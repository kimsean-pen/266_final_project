Darling, it's 'bout time to break free of
Hands and claws holding down the love
Take us to a safer place
Where we can break out of the daze
We're so weaved together, say it's forever

Come home soon, shifting moods
Mysteries drive us all
Your poisonous love's my fall

Caught a ghost smile slipping out the door fast
There's no guarantee he said and then he laughed
Never mind the history it slowly walks away you'll see
We're so weaved together and say it's forever

Come home soon, shifting moods
Mysteries drive us all
Your poisonous love's my fall
