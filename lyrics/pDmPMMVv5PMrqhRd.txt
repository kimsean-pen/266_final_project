Pray, for the earth, for the forest, for the fire
Call all the spirits of the globe and desire
All power that comes from within

Ветры злые, чертоги лесные
Недра скал и гладь морей
Лики древних, души усопших
В мареве огней

Crimes, in the name of the gods and the power
Now, I feel that brightest hour
To come back to life after being dead

Hail to the gods of fire and hail
Hail to the gods of pyre and hail
Hail to the earth, to the air, to the rain
Thanks to the gods for the air I breathe
Gods of the earth

От гиблых снов вновь пробудись
Ледяной зыбкой мглой обратись

In our eternal touch with the nature
We see communions of life and death
We see their joyous inseparable unity
We learn that life is as beautiful as death
