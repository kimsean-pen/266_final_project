You had a bottle of tequila in your hand that day
He was holding onto you like you might get away
You caught me staring from the corner of a crowded room
I was so wasted didn't notice you were staring too
They were playing INXS back on that drunken night
The moon reflected off my window to your blurry eyes
I tripped and spilt that red wine all up on your lingerie
I didn't know that you would take it off anyway
(Take it off anyway)
Lay your head next to me
I can feel you
Heart's on fire, burning
Flames of blue
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, I can feel you
I can feel you
Woah, woah, I can feel you
I can feel you
Lightning crashes, thunder smashes
Our hearts beat as one
Mascara runnin' off your lashes
Look what we've become
Disconnecting from the world
Abandon everything
Just a boy next to a girl
We could be anything
We could be anything
We could be anything
Lay your head next to me
I can feel you
Heart's on fire, burning
Flames of blue
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, I can feel you
I can feel you
Woah, woah, I can feel you
I can feel you
And after all this time you're still the only one for me
We stand the test of time I'll have you 'til infinity

Lay your head next to me
I can feel you
Heart's on fire, burning
Flames of blue
Lay you head next to me
I can feel you (you know I feel you)
Heart's on fire, burning
Flames of blue
Woah, woah, I can feel you
I can feel you too
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, I can feel you
I can feel you
Woah, woah, I can feel you
I can feel you
