Rubbing salt in my wounds
Like it don't hurt, like it don't hurt me
Your sweet, bitter love songs
That seduce me with a sinister beat

I'm bringing out the worst in you
It was never my intention to
That was just unfair to do
Salt in my wounds
Getting burned up with the negative heat

How can I stay mad with you?
When I'm so in love with you

Oh, oh, oh
I don't know what we argue about
Oh, oh, oh
When all we do is scream and shout

I still believe in our love right now
And it's gonna work out some how
You and me, we got common ground
I'm not givin' up, no

Are you looking for a way out?
Are you looking for an exit door?
It seems like all the fuss you're making
Is a sign that you're not quite sure

Well, I don't recommend you to
'Cause what we got is too good to lose
And I can tell you know it too
Or is it just aggravation? You're picking on me
You're rubbing salt in my wounds

How can I stay mad with you?
When I'm so in love with you

Oh, oh, oh
I don't know what we argue about
Oh, oh, oh
When all we do is scream and shout

I still believe in our love right now
And it's gonna work out some work
You and me, we got common ground
I'm not givin' up, no

Oh, oh, oh
I don't know what we argue about
Oh, oh, oh
When all we do is scream and shout

I still believe in our love right now
And it's gonna work out some work
You and me, we got common ground
I'm not givin' up, no

Maybe just a kind word now and then
Could turn it around and make us a happy end
But if this is it and the moment is gone
Well, then I guess I must have just got it wrong

As wise as it sounds, it just doesn't make sense
And as long as it takes, I'm gonna keep on trying
'Cause I'm not giving up on us
No, no, no, no, no, no
How can I stay mad with you?
I'm not giving up, no
When I'm so in love with you
Oh, oh, oh
I don't know what we argue about
Oh, oh, oh
When all we do is scream and shout
I still believe in our love right now
And it's gonna work out some work
You and me, we got common ground
I'm not givin' up, no
I'm not givin' up, no
I'm not givin' up, no
