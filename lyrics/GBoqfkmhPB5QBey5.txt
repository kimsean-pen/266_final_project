He's saving my life.
Nobody did the same.
Love and survive.
I wanted to repay.
Saving my life.
He was invisible.
Evidence kiss.
Fingerprints on the wall.

Wanna feel you up.
Wanna breath so.
How you gonna do it?
Wanna feel you up.
Wanna know so how you gonna do it?
Stay... Stay...

He's saving my life.
Nobody knows he could.
He makes me smile.
He makes me feel so good.
Saving my life.
Tenderly snatched a kiss.
He makes me cry.
Touching me underneath.

Wanna feel you up.
Wanna breath so.
How you gonna do it?
Wanna feel you.
Wanna know so how you gonna do it?
Stay... Stay...

Only his love can make it.
We won't change it no.
Feelings will flow.
And tonight we are burning.
No retutning.
No.
He won't let go.
Only his love can make it.
We won't change it no.
Feelings will flow.
