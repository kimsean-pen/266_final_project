I kissed the void
and crawled straight into its heart
This golden/only . I go?
I prayed to hear again
that serpent song
Wishing it be over

When love starts to die
It begins with a kiss
Violently soothing and warm
When love starts to die
When love starts to die
So do I (So do I)
So do I
That's right

My foot fail me?
In heart and stone
Still waiting for your cold

When love starts to die
It begins with a kiss
Violently soothing and warm
When love starts to die
When love starts to die
So do I (So do I)

Ooh
Love is a circle?
like angel wings spread

When love starts to die
It begins with a kiss
Violently soothing and warm
When love starts to die
When love starts to die
So do I
So I die

When love starts to die
When love starts to die
So do I
