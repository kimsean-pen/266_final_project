I don't want you to give it all up
And leave your own life collecting dust
And I don't want you to feel sorry for me
You never gave us a chance to be
And I don't need you to be by my side

To tell me that everything's alright
I just wanted you to tell me the truth
You know I'd do that for you
So Why are you running away?
Why are you running away?
Cause I did enough to show you that I

Was willing to give and sacrifice
And I was the one who was lifting you up

When you thought your life had had enough
And when I get close, you turn away
There's nothing that I can do or say
So now I need you to tell me the truth
You know I'd do that for you
So why are you running away?
Why are you running away?
Is it me (Is it me),
is it you (is it you)
Nothing that(Nothing that),
I can do (I can do)

To make you (To make you) change your mind
(Why you, you run) Is it me, is it you

(What did, you take) Nothing that I can do
(Why you, you run, Why) Is it a waste of time?
Is it me, is it you
Nothing that I can do

To make you change your mind
Oh Ohh...
So why are you running away?
Why are you running away?
(...What is it I've got to say...)
So why are you running away?
(...To make you admit you're afraid...)
Why are you running away
