This is time for a shake-up,
Look at me wake up, taking control.
This is a new beginning, my gears are spinning,
Let's rock'n'roll.
Just put. One foot. Onward and forward.
I used to be a zero but now I clearly feel that
I may be the hero who reinvents the heel.
I may be facing the impossible,
I may be chasing after miracles.
And there may be the steepest mountain to overcome.
But this is step one.
Yeah this is step one.
Who knew I had it in me,
Let me begin, see where this could go.
I've got knowledge and know how,
Don't stop the show now,
Don't stop the flow.
Just put. One foot. Onward and forward.
I used to live in limbo never dying to begin.
But now it's sink or swim, so I'd better dive right in.
I may be facing the impossible,
I may be chasing after miracles.
And there may be the steepest mountain to overcome.
But this is step one.
It's not just a factory. This is my family.
No one's gonna shut us down.
Not while Charlie Price is around.
We may be facing the impossible,
We may be chasing after miracles.
And there may be the steepest mountain to overcome.
We may be facing the impossible,
We may be chasing after miracles.
And there may be the steepest mountain to overcome.
But this is step one.
Look what Charlie Boy has done.
This is step one.
