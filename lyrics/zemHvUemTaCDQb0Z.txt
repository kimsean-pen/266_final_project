Bitterness, was right on her tongue
With her legs, painted like the drum
Loneliness, couldn't do no harm,
Nor the kiss, of her scented balm

Oh honey I'm just getting good at saying goodbye
Getting good at saying goodbye,
Getting good at saying goodbye

Oh honey I'm just getting good at saying goodbye
Getting good at saying goodbye,
Getting good at saying goodbye

Heaviness of this heart shut wide,
Now my flesh, at arms with my pride,
Her long dress, left no room to pry,
So i confess to the gods of time,

Oh honey I'm just getting good at saying goodbye
Getting good at saying goodbye,
Getting good at saying goodbye

Oh honey I'm just getting good at saying goodbye
Getting good at saying goodbye,
Getting good at saying goodbye

Oooaah, there goes my innocence
Oooaah, there goes my innocence
Oooaah, there goes my innocence
Oooaah, there goes my innocence
