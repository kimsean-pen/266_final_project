Fall, rewrite.
Tape the noise.
Weeks are spent
Miles below us
All that's left of your harvest
The fruit of your carnage
Steal delight
So empty and wild
Above us
All that's left are your highs
And so was I

Runaway child
Runaway we sever love
That you hoped for
In your haste
You were there for me
You were there you lit the light
That took the darkness
From my taste

Shame on your fathers
Dropping all your loving daughters
To the bones
See your bloodlines
'Neath the autumn whispers
I am made to wander
I am made to plunder

Her. Her.
Her. Her.
For what?

Runaway child
Runaway we sever love
That you hoped for
In your haste
You were there for me
You were there you lit the light
That took the darkness
From my taste

Shame on your fathers
Dropping all your loving daughters
To the bones
See your bloodlines
'Neath the autumn whispers
I am made to wander
I am made to plunder

Runaway child
This was only our mistake
Runaway child
Heed the biding of the day
