Well, I ain't got a kiss left to give you
'Cause you weren't good to me
And I ain't got no news left to feed you
'Cause you weren't good to me
It's cold
It's dark
It's deep and it's wet
And you ain't gonna make it
If you don't let someone in
Darlin'
Darlin'
Darlin'
Why don't you sleep at night?
The colder the heart
The warmer the gun
Shotgun Alynda
Bring me your eyes
I wish to see like you
You're looking froze
And weathered, my dear
And your lips and your cheeks
Are turning blue
It's cold
It's dark
It's deep and it's wet
And you ain't gonna make it
If you don't let someone in
Darlin'
Darlin'
Darlin'
Why don't you sleep at night?
The colder the heart
The warmer the gun
Darlin'
Darlin'
Darlin'
Why don't you sleep at night?
The colder the heart
The warmer the gun
