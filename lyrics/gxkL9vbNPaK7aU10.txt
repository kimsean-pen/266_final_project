stone love with the number one sound
a 44 in the background

no platinum selector of the time
don't watch my size in this hall
while my backs against the wall
take a ride, competition take a ride
pull it operator drop the other side
thought it was over, so far from done
as they dance into the sun

some bring up new style holding trophy cups
Rory select while my speakers erupt
sound sweeter with an echo chamber
don't you know that they are the danger
3 bottles of Cristal and it's agreed
the best would only come from the Don Wesley
close my eyes while i take a ride

fold up the bag in a yard style
don't worry bout that you see it's all natural
police chasing this bandilero
running down the road with my thick payroll
one stop was my music shop
where I heard this guitar screamin

some bring up new style holding trophy cups
Rory select while my speakers erupt
the sound sweeter with an echo chamber
don't you know that they are the danger
3 bottles of Cristal and it's agreed
the best would only come from the Don Wesley
close my eyes and take a ride

take a ride everybody take a ride (out)
