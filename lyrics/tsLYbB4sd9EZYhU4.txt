The shades of night descend
The shades of night descend
Sitting in the empty black
The last slivers of dusk have passed
Accept the dawn to ease the fear
One day I will not be here
Death she comes and with her thread
Upon me ties a mask for dead
Tears of blood begin to seep
And bleed the sky
The shades of night descend

Descend the shades of night
Death shines her golden light
Across a blackened sky
All our hate is a product of a world we created

The shades of night descend
The shades of night descend
Ashen clouds obscure my brain
Doubts begin to turn to shame
Insecureness tears at bliss
I hate me for this weakness
Faith drives me to carry on
And take the road less travelled on
Resentment swallowed means to drown
The poison down
The shades of night descend

Descend the shades of night
Death shines her golden light
Across a blackened sky
All our hate is a product of a world we created

Scream with me
Bleed with me
Seethe with me
Sing with me
Scream with me
Bleed with me
Seethe with me
Sing with me

Free me
Free me
Free me

Descend
Descend the shades of night, descend
Death shines her golden light (death shines her light)
Across the blackened sky (across a black...)
The shades of night descend
The shades of night descend

The shades of night descend
The shades of night descend
The shades of night descend
