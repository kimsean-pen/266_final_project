Run, run 'til you drop
Hide, everyone knows

We all trade in never-befores
Selling out for the score

Pray, squeal when you're caught
Cry, it's not my fault

Time to trade in never-befores
Selling out for the score

It seems you prophesized, all of this would end
Were you burned away when the sun rose again

Hate, long wearing thin
Negative, all you've been

Time to trade in never-befores
Selling out for the score

It seems you prophesized, all of this would end
Were you burned away when the sun rose again
