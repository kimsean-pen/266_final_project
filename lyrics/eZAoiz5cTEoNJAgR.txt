You keep me awake,
It's where i want to be
Please dont let me sleep
On all my stalen dreams
The winter has made me wanted more, oh
You cant walk away from me
I'm thinking about your childhood gift, oh
You can't walk away from me
The winter has made me wanted more, oh
You cant walk away from me
I'm thinking about your childhood gift, oh
You'll never complete me,
though I like your kind
Somehow it would change,
the way we feel inside
The winter has made me wanted more, oh
You cant walk away from me
I'm thinking about your childhood gift, oh
You can't walk away from me
Thinking about your childhood gift, oh
You cant walk away from me
Seem like i felt these walls before, oh
You cant walk away from me,
You cant walk away from me

The winter has made me wanted more, oh
You cant walk away from me
The winter has made me wanted more, oh
You can't walk away from me
Thinking about your childhood gift, oh
You cant walk away from me
Some difference it makes when we escape the time
Dont try to renew, dont try to read the signs
The winter has made me wanted more, oh
You cant walk away from me
Im thinking about you childhood gift, oh
You cant walk away from me,
The winter has made me wanted more, oh
You can't walk away from me, oh
I'm thinking about your childhood gift, oh
You can't walk away from me,
You cant walk away form me,
You cant walk away from me.
