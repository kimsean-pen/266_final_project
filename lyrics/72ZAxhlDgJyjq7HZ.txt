I don't need diamond rings or high priced suits that shine
Limousines and flashy things or ancient bottled wine
Designer names and lavish things and million dollar hair
Bonny Dames without a brain, I never really cared

I don't care

Nothin' about it
I don't care for glitzy things or a fancy neighborhood
Glamor games or plastic fame or the king of Hollywood
Dazzling flamboyant things or a top hat on my head

Or modeling for magazines or to be a debonaire
I don't care
Nothin' about it
I don't care
Nothing about it
I don't care
Nothing about it
