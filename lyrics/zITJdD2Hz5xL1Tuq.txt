Don't forget
Don't forget you got a key
Yeah, a cosmic key
Oh, I love you so much
Don't forget
We're all blowing in
The interstellar wind
I'm your little galaxy
Don't forget
Don't forget sometimes
We all, we all think about dying
Don't let it kill you
Don't forget
I won't forget the long drive
We arrived in time to say goodbye
And the way my roses shook
I won't overlook
The willows bending by the graves
The very next day in the shade
Sweating in a new suit
I don't regret
I don't regret sometimes
We all, we all think about dying, oh
Don't let it kill you

Don't forget
Don't forget to brush your teeth
Or you'll have a funny smile
You don't have to smile at me
Don't forget
Don't forget sometimes
We all, we all think about dying
Don't let it kill you
Don't forget
Don't forget sometimes
We all, we all think about dying, oh
