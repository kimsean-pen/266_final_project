Somedays it's so easy
And sometimes I forget how
Much I want you back again
Back again

Maybe it's a game
You win some
And you lose some
Oh, when you find a good one
Don't you let her get away

Don't let her go
Oh yeah
If only I could have you
Just the way I want to

Oh, to have you back again
Back again
Oh, I'm just a fool baby
Playing it Mr. Cool baby
Rolling around like I got
Nothing much to lose
Oh, but I know you

And you know me
And I know you can see
So help me find my way
Back to you

Back to you
Walking past your window
You used to smile
When you'd throw

Your sweet kisses back to me
Back to me
Oh yeah
Remember when I asked you
If you'd be my one true?
Oh it seems like yesterday
It's yesterday

Oh yeah
But I'm just a fool baby

Playing it Mr. Cool baby
Rolling around like I got
Nothing much to lose

Oh, but I know you
And you know me
And I know you can see
So help me get my way
Back to you
Back to you

I want you
So take me back please

Take me back
Oh baby
If only I could have you

Just the way I want to
Yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah
But I'm just a fool baby
Playing it Mr. Cool baby R
olling around like I got
Nothing much to lose
But I know you
And you know me
And I know you can see
So help me get my way
Back to you
