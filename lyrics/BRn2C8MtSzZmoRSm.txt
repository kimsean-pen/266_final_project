Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Our love what we once treasured
Your ways what I remember most of all
Can't quite get away
From the days we love so heavenly

Your kiss such a sweet surrender
That day when I let my temper
Get the best of what we used to have
Now I got to ask you can you make it

Like it used to be
Bring back your love to me
I remember when our love was new
And all I needed in my life was you
And baby it felt so right to me
Please make it like it used to be

Now I won't usually press nobody
But why can't words said so hastily
Be forgotten and forgiven me

Thought the love that we had
Count for anything else
Only one way to find out how
And you know how, baby, baby, baby

Like it used to be
Bring back your love to me
I remember when our love was new
And all I needed in my life was you
And baby it felt so right to me
Please make it like it used to be

Like it used to be
Bring back your love to me
I remember when our love was new
And all I needed in my life was you
And baby it felt so right to me
Please make it like it used to be

Oh, I don't wanna lose your love
And I can't stand to lose your touch
Oh, I can still remember when our love was strong
But I don't know where we went wrong

Like it used to be
Bring back your love to me
I remember when our love was new
And all I needed in my life was you
And baby it felt so right to me
Please make it like it used to be

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
