You're used to that sound of a heart that's breaking
I know it don't phase you anymore
You're the king of the game that you played
I know you played it a hundred times before

You fill your bedroom up with trophies
Then you get a kick out of closing the door
Got all the words to keep on hoping
I know you said them a hundred times before

But then there's me, a false for your gold
Then there's me, just love me for fun
Baby, there's me, no use or pretend
Oh, there's me, a 101

I might as well stand in front of a bullet
Close my eyes and kick the chair to the floor
It's like a speeding train is coming
I know you've crashed it a hundred times before

Then there's me, all false for your gold
Now that there's me, just love me for fun
Oh, there's me, no, no use in pretending
Oh, there's me, a 101

Everybody says I gotta be crazy
That I deserve everything that I get
But I got a feeling that makes me wanna ignore
All that you've done a hundred times before

'Cause then there's me, could I be the one?
And baby, there's me to make you undone
Uh darling, there's me, no, no use in pretending
Oh, there's me, a 101

So I gotta be I gotta be
I gotta be a hundred and one
Maybe it's time, maybe it's me
Maybe I could be, maybe pretend
(Let me pretend)

I gotta be, I wanna be a 101
Yeah, baby
