Shaken and stirred in the dungeons!
Why is it you find yourself there?
Left in the mud - without a torch
(A fruitless endeavour) and no one cares!
... no they don't - ah!

Seen stumbling around in darkness - questioning honours and dreams
Those treasures will never befall you - they're out of reach

Crawling out at the foot of the mountain
Even weaker than when you entered!
- when you have no soul and guidance is none, there's no use in being self-centered!
... no it ain't!

Seen stumbling around in the darkness - questioning honours and dreams
(Then) those treasures will never befall you - they're out of reach...
... for you!
