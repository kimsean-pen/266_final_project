I think I'm losing who I am
I want to show you where it hurts
But you'll never understand
And it only makes you cry
When I tell you what I'm thinking
It's always on my mind
That empty feeling

I wanna feel it hurt, hurt
I wanna feel it hurt, hurt

I wanna know how I'm gonna die
I'll be waiting for you, baby, on the other side
I wanna know that you needed me around
When you come for me
My feet didn't touch the ground

I've been running with the sun shining in my eyes
I've been standing on the edge all night wondering if I can fly

I wanna feel it hurt, hurt
I wanna feel it hurt, hurt
Do you think that I can touch the sky
Before the pavement paints me dead?
I wanna feel it hurt, hurt

Help me, I need a reason
(I need a reason, help me)
Save me, stop me from leaving
(Stop me from leaving, stop me)
Help me, I need a reason
(I need a reason, help me)
Save me, stop me from leaving
(Stop me from leaving, stop me)

I want to feel it hurt

I wanna feel it hurt, hurt
I wanna feel it hurt, hurt
Do you think that I could touch the sky
Before the pavement paints me dead?
I wanna feel it hurt, hurt
