Lay your head down
Let my love down in my el dorado
Let your hair out
We can leave now in my el dorado

We gotta leave before you say no
I don't want [?]
Let it you
Let it kill you
Let it find you
[?] your pale skin
We can ride all night
We can drive all night
I know you want more than this
[?] thought that we could find someone in you

Lay your head down
Let my love down in my el dorado
Let your hair out
We can leave now in my el dorado

I see why, you wanna run
I see why, you wanna hide
Don't let em tell you, nothing about me
Don't let em tell you, nothing about me

I can't find you
Cause I can't find you

Lay your head down
Let my love down in my el dorado
Let your hair out
We can leave now in my el dorado
