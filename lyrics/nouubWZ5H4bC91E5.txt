Who made up all the rules
We follow them like fools
Believe them to be true
Don't care to think them through

I'm sorry
So sorry
I'm sorry
It's like this
I'm sorry
So sorry
I'm sorry
We do this

And it's ironic too
'Cause what we tend to do
Is act on what they say
And then it is that way

I'm sorry
So sorry
I'm sorry
It's like this
I'm sorry
So sorry
I'm sorry
We do this

Who are they
Where are they
How can they possibly know all this

Who are they
Where are they
How can they possibly know all this

Do you see what I see
Why do we
Live like this
Is it because it's true
That ignorance is bliss

Who are they
Where are they
How do they know all this
I'm sorry
So sorry
I'm sorry
It's like this

Do you see what I see
Why do we
Live like this
Is it because it's true
That ignorance is bliss
Who are they
Where are they
How can they know all this
I'm sorry
So sorry
I'm sorry
We do this
