I thought I was
A ghost
Turns out all this time
I was a cloud
Floating in the air

I thought I was
A ghost
Floating in the air

I was cold
I'm freezing
Now I'm frozen

You cant see
Cant cast a shadow frozen
Frozen in space

Cant show
The only thing
You can't hold

The only thing
You can't hold

The only thing
You cant hold

what is it
you can't hold

only thing to cast a shadow

That still casts a shadow
