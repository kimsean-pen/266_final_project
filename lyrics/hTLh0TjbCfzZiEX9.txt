I was born to the world
But no one willing to receive
In the blossom of my generations spring
Flowers blind, withering

Observe and then repeat
This mistreatment done to me
I am the living effigy
Of each depressing memory

If time has proved one thing
If you kick the cage you must suffer the bite

My arms bent backwards
Legs twisted out of shape
Disgusting mess of a human
Limbs form a cell I can't escape

Self medication, the path I' have been led
A fear of all things lucid

When I try to stand the
Ground falls away from my feet

Free falling in this hell
You have made your home
Your safety nets in place
No one will catch me

I'm just a victim of my surroundings
Born with a blade to my throat

Shout at the sky
Scream into the void
