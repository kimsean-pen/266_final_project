Never been a lover
Never been a fighter though
Heard that on the radio

Killing all my good cells
Letting all my worries drown
Letting all my people down

If I'm not with you, I'm against you
New school, I'll offend you now
Can never make a sound

As I dig six feet underneath my heart beats
And I don't recognize one face in the crowd

So I blame it on rock and roll
And I'll blame it on my guitar
I'm ungrateful, spiteful, selfish, alone

Blame it on rock and roll
And I'll blame it on my guitar
I'll deflect it all

I remember back then
Going to a punk rock show
Day dreaming I would play my own

Wanted to be greater
Wanted to be glorious
Ended up a bitter lush

And I blame it on rock and roll
And I blame it on my guitar
I'm ungrateful, spiteful, selfish, alone

Blame on rock and roll
And I blame it my guitar
I'll deflect it all

Ain't it the feeling that you know that you can't replace?
Ain't it the buzz of oncoming disaster?
Ain't it the women that you're never allowed to chase?
How can you tell me you love me?

When all I see is number one
Number two, three, four, five, six, they're bound to run
When happiness is a loaded gun
And I wave in their faces 'til there ain't anyone

I'll blame it on rock and roll
And I'll blame it on my guitar
I'm ungrateful, spiteful, selfish, alone

Blame it on rock and roll
And I blame it on my guitar
I'll deflect it all

I'll blame it on rock and roll
And I'll blame it on my guitar
I'm ungrateful, spiteful, selfish, alone

Blame it on rock and roll
And I blame it on my guitar
I'll deflect it all
