Darlin'
Is it dark, is it dim in the restaurant?
'Cause you're looking like a blind man
Looking away, it's too late, it's too long
See me giving shade
While you're leaning all the way right around me
To that other girl, and it hurts and I want is

Lookie, lookie, lookie, lookie right at me
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme full screen
Focus, focus, trim the borders, baby
I'll break that spell you'll see, 'cause…

When I snap my fingers
Whip your head around, boy
When I snap my fingers
Whip, whip, whip back to me

When I snap my fingers
Whip your head around, boy
When I snap my fingers
Whip, whip, whip back to me

Rude boy
What you out on the town for with a girl?
If you want more
Set her down
Or you pick her up when I'm gone 'cause I'm done
Lady
That is me
Not a side piece
Put your arm right around me
Yeah, let her know, let her know I'm the one

Lookie, lookie, lookie, lookie right at me
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme full screen
Focus, focus, trim the borders, baby
I'll break that spell you'll see, 'cause…

When I snap my fingers
Whip your head around, boy
When I snap my fingers
Whip, whip, whip back to me

When I snap my fingers
Whip your head around, boy
When I snap my fingers
Whip, whip, whip back to me

Oh, whip, whip, whip
Oh, whip, whip, whip
Oh, whip, whip, whip
Oh
I'll break that spell you'll see, 'cause…

When I snap my fingers
Whip your head around, boy
When I snap my fingers
Whip, whip, whip back to me

When I snap my fingers
Whip your head around, boy
When I snap my fingers
Whip, whip, whip back to me

Whip, whip, whip
Whip, whip, whip
