Yeah

Seem like the life I feel
Seem like the life I feels a little distant
Seem like the life I need
Seem like the life I needs a little distant, yeah

Like the remedy, yeah
Sit back while I watch tv
Do it on repeat repeat
this shit's controlling me
Angels, halos over me
I need blessings and my peace
You been off the streets, yeah
Probably gon' meet my all G's
we been gone for a week
Now you wanna peak
Hands up, why they tryna reach?
I can't even get that deep
Told you I don't teach
Practice, oh, no, never preach
Practice, oh, no, never preach
Infiltrate the enemy
Moving on them randomly

Feels like the life I need's a little distant yeah
Feel's like the life I need
Feels like the life I need's a little distant yeah
