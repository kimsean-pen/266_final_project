She's got an alligator bag
Top hat to match
Dressed in black on black
She's got a Filipino girlie
She claims is her friend
I tell you boys, you just gotta laugh
Now I used to call her Cindy
She changed her name to "Sin"
I guess that's the name of her game
I really used to love her
Then, the kitty she discovered
It's got to be a sexual thing

All, all around the world
Girls will be girls
It's the same ol', same ol' situation
It's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain
I say no no no
No no no

duced me to her lover
In a cellophane dress
Then they bid me a sweet fairwell
Last time I saw them
They were kissing so softly
To the sound of wedding bells

Well around the world
Girls will be girls
It's the same ol', same ol' situation
It's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain
Don't you know girl, it's the same ol', same ol' situation
Everyday it's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain
I say no no no
No no no

It's the same ol', same ol' situation
It's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain
Girl, it's the same ol', same ol' situation
It's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain
You know it's just got to say
All around the world
Girls will be girls

It's the same ol', same ol' situation
It's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain
I tell you girl, it's the same ol', same ol' situation
It's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain
Yeah yeah no no
