Thoughts of him where love is thin
Can't you see the state you're in?
What you're feeling isn't true
What you've gotta do

Is turn away
(Leave the past behind)
You can say
(We'll give it our best try)

Turn away
(Never live a lie)
A brighter day
(A brighter day's in sight)

Never seek, you'll never find
How can you have peace of mind?
You belong with someone else
Is it time you asked yourself

To turn away
(Leave the past behind)
You can say
(We'll give it our best try)

Turn away
(Never live a lie)
A brighter day
(A brighter day's in sight)

It is time that you move on
It is love been away too long
This is lost where you belong
It is time that you move on, move on

It is time that you move on
It is love been away too long
This is lost where you belong
It is time that you move on, move on

Move on
(Move on, move on)
Move on
(Move on, move on)

It is time that you move on
It is love been away too long
This is lost where you belong
It is time that you move on, move on

Move on
(Move on move on)
Move on
(Move on move on)
