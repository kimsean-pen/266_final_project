(Spoken) I used to do lots of things

I used to do things, and I'd say things, and Jesus I was evil
Fake things and break things and Jesus I was evil
I never shook babies
I never beat no ladies

I used to crash parties and Maserati's and Jesus I was evil
Go places and pull faces and Jesus I was evil
I never shook babies
I never beat no ladies

But Jesus I was evil
Jesus I was e-vil

(he never shook babies, he never beat no ladies)

Now I help old ladies cross the street and I
Now I shine the shoes upon my feet and I
Now I grow the food that feeds the homeless in the streets and I
Comb my hair one billion times a week and I
Say my prayers before I go to sleep at night

I never shook babies
I could never beat no ladies

I never shook babies
I never beat no ladies

But Jesus I was evil
Jesus I was evil

(He never shook babies, he never beat ladies)

Jesus I was evil, Jesus I was evil
