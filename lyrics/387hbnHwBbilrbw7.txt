To see the interior of a dark coffin
What is it like to be inside dead?
Is there something that I might perceive,
Or is it lost in infinity?

Viley maggots swarm within stale pus,
Accelerating rate of putridity
Thought patterns preserved in energetic form
Or is it all, lost in infinity?

Viley maggots swarm within stale pus,
Accelerating rate of putridity
Thought patterns preserved in energetic form
Or is it all, lost in infinity?

Fierce

Is there something that I - I might live,
Or is it all lost in nothingness?

Fierce

Weakened tissue starts rapidly to degrade
Under progressive foulness,
Former vital organs are replaced
By a clump of corpse tumors
Is that what expects us in the deep - (just) corpse tumors?

Weakened tissue starts rapidly to degrade
Under progressive foulness,
Former vital organs are replaced
By a clump of corpse tumors
