Clear as a bell and an echoing shell
Clear as a pane of glass
I realize, I can't revise
As clear as a big blue sky
Through and through and all
You're trying to stall
as clear as a crystal ball
As the facets are bold and platinum and gold
Clear as a flawless diamond

I'm hitting the wall
I know I'm gonna fall for you
Is it my fate or fatal attraction
Could it be a fait accomplit?

Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?

Dark as a winter's moonless night
Dark as a velvet cape
I realize, I can't revise
As dark as the other side
I can recommend but I can't defend
As dark as a deep sea trench
I was stuck in a tar pit having a shit fit
Dark as an angry inch

Ah, I can't wait you're are an out-of-state plate oh
It's creepy fate or fatal attraction
Could it be a fait accomplit?

Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?

Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
