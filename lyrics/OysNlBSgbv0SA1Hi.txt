Clear the cobwebs off my brain
Ants have caves
It's not that great
Piss and shit upholds the flood
I'll rake them up
It's just my luck

Oh no (whoohoo)

Muckraker, oh muckraker
Muckraker
Muckraker

Ooh

Clear the cobwebs off my brain
Ants have caves
It's not that great
Piss and shit upholds the flood
I'll rake them up
It's just my luck

Oh no (whoohoo)

Muckraker, oh muckraker
Muckraker
Muckraker
