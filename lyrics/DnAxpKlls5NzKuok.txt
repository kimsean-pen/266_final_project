So far from who I was
From who I love
From who I want to be

So far from all our dreams
From all it means
From you here next to me

So far from seeing home
I stand out here alone
Am I asking for too much

So far from being free
From the past that's haunting me
The future I just can't touch

And if you take my hand
Please pull me from the dark
And show me hope again
We'll run side by side
No secrets left to hide
Sheltered from the pain
