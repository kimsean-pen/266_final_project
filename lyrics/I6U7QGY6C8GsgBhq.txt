Oh let out
Oh let out some intention!
Your beauty, your charm, destructive, disarmed
Disarmed

My chaos, it kills me, my chaos for thee, it thrills me
I know who you are
This distance is tearing me apart
Apart

Slow down
Slow down baby

Fading, spinning, faster, faster
Tell me what will we be after this is over
Let me know: do you need this?!
Cause I just wanna go home!

This chase is relentless
This pace isn't real
These things you feel
This patience it shows, I guess that's just the way it goes
It goes...

Oh let out
Your beauty, your charm, destructive, disarmed
Disarmed

I just wanna go home!
Am i out of my depth?!
One more slip and it's gone...
I never wanna let go!
Are you beginning to notice?
Cause it's starting to show
And i just wanna go home!
