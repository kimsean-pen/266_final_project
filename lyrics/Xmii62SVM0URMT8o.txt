And when I see you
I really see you upside-down
But my brain knows better,
It picks you up and turns you around

Turns you around
Turns you around
If you feel discouraged

When there's a lack of color here

Please don't worry lover

It's really bursting at the seams
From absorbing everything

The spectrums A to Z

This is fact not fiction

For the first time in years

And all the girls from every girly magazine can't make me feel
Any less alone
I'm reaching for the phone
To call at 7: 03

And on your machine I slur a plea for you to come home
But I know it's too late
And I should've given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay

This is fact not fiction
For the first time in years
