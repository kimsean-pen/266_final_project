I'm wearin' thin
I couldn't tell you
The city I'm in

The streets and the buildings
The places I've been
Or where the star's goin'

It's daylight again
Or where the time went.
Oh. who can save me now?
My life in the rear view
I'm running from Jesus
Don't know where I'm goin' to.
Got nothin' to lose, I'm fightin' my demons

Been lookin' for someone like you
I've been lookin for someone like you.
So, sing me a song

I know all the words to
And I'll sing along
Could you be my savior?

Been out here too long
And I've just been lookin' for somewhere to belong
They'll be holdin on
So, can you save me now?
My life in the rear view
I'm running from Jesus
Don't know where I'm goin' to.

Got nothin' to lose, I'm fightin' my demons
Been lookin' for someone like you
I've been lookin for someone like you.
When the stars explode
And I'm all alone
When they start to see the smoke
When I'm finally burnin' out
I'll need someone to carry me home safe and sound.
My life in the rear view
I'm running from Jesus
Don't know where I'm goin' to.
But I got nothin' to lose, I'm fightin' my demons
Been lookin' for someone like you
My life in the rear view
I'm running from Jesus
Don't know where I'm goin' to.
Got nothin' to lose, I'm fightin' my demons
Been lookin' for someone like you
I've been lookin for someone like you
I've been lookin for someone like you.
