My dream last night was about Ali Baba
With the forty thieves
Tom, Tom, the piper's son,
he was there with me

I rode through the valley with the princess by my side
The Duke and the Duchess was there to meet me with a smile

Alice was there in a Wonderland
Staring far away
The three blind mice was there with me
To tell the Teddybear the tale

The Teddybear came smiling there with a big smile
The little Bo-peep has lost a sheep last night

Dream last night about Ali Baba
With the forty thieves
Tom, Tom, the piper's son,
he was there with me

I rode through the valley with the princess by my side
The Duke and the Duchess did a Reggae Reggae Reggae last night

Intermezzo
