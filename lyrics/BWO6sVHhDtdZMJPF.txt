I would sleep better on your floor, than I would ever in my bed.
And if your carpet makes my face itch, it'd still be heaven in my head.
I would play more than just four chords, if it's a song that you might like.

She said, "Break your neck, and I will love you every night. You will be mine."

And she said, "Sometimes, things just don't work out the way you want them to.
Sometimes, things just don't work out. It's better me than it is you.
Sometimes, things just don't work out the way they should flow through.
Sometimes, things just don't work out the way you want them to"

"Break your neck, and I will love you like a bird that cannot fly. You will be fine."
And she said, "Break your neck, and I will love you every night. You will be fine."

And today we could do something that we wouldn't never do before
And today we could do something, never do before
And today we could do something we would have never done before
Done before, done before
