I got it good girl
'Cause I got myself a good girl
Yeah you up and took my whole world
And made it so good girl

You're an angel
You're a keeper
The kinda thing that you gotta lock down
I'm lovin' just livin'
Every minute since you came around

I was lost in the neon lights
'Til the day that you called me yours
Yeah and they say when you know, you know
And I know one thing's for sure

I got it good girl
'Cause I got myself a good girl
I still can't believe I found you
Can't imagine life without you

I could take you home to mama
Take you to the church right down the street
Yeah you up and took my whole world
And made it so good girl
Aww so good baby yeah

You know sometimes I dream
About fifty-five years from now
Gonna still be you and me
Watchin' that sun goin' down

I'll still be stealin' your kisses (what else?)
I'll still be holdin' your hand (what else?)
I'll still look at you and I'll pinch myself
Good Lord I'm a lucky man

I got it good girl
'Cause I got myself a good girl
I still can't believe I found you
Can't imagine life without you

I could take you home to mama
Take you to the church right down the street
Yeah you up and took my whole world
And made it so good girl
Aww so good baby

I was lost in the neon lights
'Til the day that you called me yours
Yeah and they say when you know, you know
And I know one thing's for sure

I got it good girl
'Cause I got myself a good girl
I still can't believe I found you
Can't imagine life without you

I could take you home to mama
Take you to the church right down the street
Yeah you up and took my whole world
And made it so good girl

Aww so good baby
(Got myself a good girl)
(I still can't believe I found you)
(Good Lord I'm a lucky man)

I could take you home to mama
Take you to the church right down the street
Yeah you up and took my whole world
And made it so good girl
Aww so good baby
