Find ourselves pulling back together
This love has got us fooled again
Thinking that this time we'll make it better
And we're losing our senses under pressure
Like it isn't gonna hurt us again
Well maybe the best things dont last forever

Now you've got me started
And I'm on you again
Thinking 'bout your
And what you do with your hands

We're body 2 body
We're back where we started
We're body 2 body
We're back where we started

We're finding ourselves pulling back together
This love has got us playing pretend
Saying that this time it's gonna be better
And we come to our senses waking up after
Saying we're never gonna do it again
And baby the best things don't last forever

Now you've got me started
And I'm on you again
I'm thinking 'bout your
And what you do with your hands
And if we're gonna fight it
Then can we have one last round
And if its not forever
Well then its just for right now

We're body 2 body
We're back where we started
We're body 2 body
We're back where we started
We're body 2 body
We're back where we started

We're trying to get to the end of it
But ending up at the start
And every time we begin again
We remember why we are where we are
But we're gonna fight it
So let's have one last round
And if it's not forever
And if it's not forever

We're body 2 body
We're back where we started
We're body 2 body
We're back where we started
We're body 2 body
We're back where we started
