Her footsteps still here in the sand
Her life was left in my hands
She never had much to say

Beyond the sea
Beyond the ordinary
We set her free to far off territories
The stars are falling
The waves are calling
Heart and mind are free
Beyond the sea

Whispers kept low in the water
My one and only daughter
How could it end this way

And I could see
Beyond the ordinary
The distant sea, unholy trinity
Paths collided
Lines divided
Heart and mind are free
Beyond the sea

Her heart and mind are free
Somewhere beyond the sea
