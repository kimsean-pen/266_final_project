I was so low
People almost made me give up trying
Always said no
Then I turned around saw someone smiling

I stepped into, I stepped into
Into another, into another
I stepped into, I stepped into
Into another, into another world

There was no light
I was going to all the wrong places
Like day from night
Suddenly I saw a thousand faces

I stepped into, I stepped into
Into another, into another
I stepped into, I stepped into
Into another, into another world

Stepped into, I stepped into
Into another, into another
I stepped into, I stepped into
Into another, into another

I stepped into, I stepped into
Into another, into another
I stepped into, I stepped into
Into another, into another world
