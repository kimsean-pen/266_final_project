Can you see in my eyes
that I was keeping my feelings inside
Should I be telling everybody
I don't know what to do

Are there the signs to recognize
or has someone been telling me lies
I should never let a rumour
change my point of view

It's just that I'm afraid that I could be
falling in love too soon

Just listen to your heart that's what they say
Listen to your heart you'll be okay
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart

Somewhere there's a truth you can't deny
that life is too short for goodbye
If I always let my heart
control what's in my mind

It's just that I'm afraid maybe one day
of breaking this heart of mine

Just listen to your heart that's what they say
Listen to your heart you'll be okay
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart

Just listen to your heart and you will find
all your hopes and fears will turn out fine
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart

It's just that I'm afraid that I could be
falling in love too soon

Just listen to your heart that's what they say
Listen to your heart you'll be okay
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart

Just listen to your heart and you will find
all your hopes and fears will turn out fine
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart

Just listen to your heart that's what they say
Listen to your heart you'll be okay
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
