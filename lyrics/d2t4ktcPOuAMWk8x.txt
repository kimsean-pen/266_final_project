Outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes
Sounding in the wind
In the heat of every battle
Hold the skiltron high

No forbidding will stop them
When they're coming through
Encouraging a whole army
Standing in the rearguard

Bagpipes of war
Powerful as thunder
Requiem for an epic fight
Bagpipes of war
Prelude of Fury
Let the bagpipes start the war
