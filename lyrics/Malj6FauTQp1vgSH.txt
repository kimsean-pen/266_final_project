I'll tell you something, I am a wolf but
I like to wear sheep's clothing
I am a bonfire, I am a vampire
I'm waiting for my moment

You come on like a drug, I just can't get enough
I'm like an addict coming at you for a little more
And there's so much at stake, I can't afford to waste
I never needed anybody like this before

I'll tell you something, I am a demon
Some say my biggest weakness
I have my reasons, call it my defects
Be careful what you're wishing

You come on like a drug, I just can't get enough
I'm like an addict coming at you for a little more
And there's so much at stake, I can't afford to waste
I never needed anybody like this before

You are a secret, a new possession
I like to keep you guessing

You come on like a drug, I just can't get enough
I'm like an addict coming at you for a litttle more
and there is so much at stake, I cannot afford to waste
I never needed anybody like this before

When I'm not sure what I'm living for
(When I'm not sure who I am)
When I'm not sure what I'm looking for
(When I'm not sure who I am)

When I'm not sure what I'm living for
(When I'm not sure who I am)
When I'm not sure what I'm looking for
(When I'm not sure who I am)

When I'm not sure what I'm living for
(When I'm not sure who I am)
When I'm not sure what I'm looking for
(When I'm not sure who I am)
