I know you felt
You wanted the truth
That you rather be hurt
Than be in doubt
I will tell you
Anything you want to hear
Everything that happened
And how we ended up here

You know we could
Leave out the truth
And try to clear the way
I promise you
A fair display
There's no such thing as truth anyway

Here is the sum of lies
We can agree upon
Lines to rewrite our story
We lie in the hopes of becoming

If we do as we should
And leave out the truth
Oh, what we would gain
Then I promise you
A fair display
There's no such thing as truth anyway

Here is the sum of lies
We can agree upon
Lines to rewrite our story
We lie in the hopes of becoming

Here is the sum of lies
(Here is the sum of lies)
We can agree upon
(We can agree upon)
Lines to rewrite our story
(Lines to rewrite our story)
We lie in the hopes of becoming
(We lie in the hopes of becoming)
