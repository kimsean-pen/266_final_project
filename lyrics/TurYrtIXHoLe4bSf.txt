I don't wanna wake up
once I've made my mind up

So tell it to me straight up
if you want it all to stop

Cause I don't wanna cause you any trouble
put you in a struggle

I guess we love the pain

Even though we messed up
always getting back up

I want you to stay
It hurts but I'm in need
I'll be lovin you lovin you you

No matter how I bleed
I'll be lovin you lovin you

I don't give a
I don't give a
I don't give a

I don't give a
I don't give a
I don't give a

I don't give a
I don't give a
I don't give a
fuck what the others say

I don't give a
I don't give a
I don't give a

I don't give a
I don't give a
I don't give a

I don't give a
I don't give a
I don't give a
fuck what the others say

I know your love will kill me
do your thing and heal me

I know that you can hear me
guess I found my remedy

But I don't wanna cause you any trouble
put you in a struggle
I guess we love the pain

It hurts but I'm in need
I'll be lovin you lovin you

I don't give a
I don't give a
I don't give a

I don't give a
I don't give a
I don't give a

I don't give a
I don't give a
I don't give a
fuck what the others say

I don't give a
I don't give a
I don't give a

I don't give a
I don't give a
I don't give a

I don't give a
I don't give a

fuck what the others say

Hey fuck what they say
Hey fuck what they say
Hey fuck what they say

I'll lo love you anyway
