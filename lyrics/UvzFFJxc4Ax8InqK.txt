Well if you're in from the start
Then we're in this together
If you're not then I'll have to
Take on this world
Cause this world can't take on me
I won't let go
I feel so lost without it
Crawl down my throat
I just can't think about it now
If it's your turn to live
Then it's my turn to give it up
And if you drop the bomb
Then I'll pick it up

I'm afraid to be
I stick it out by my heart can't hack it
Just an example of inconsistency
I feel like I'm jaded
I've given it all I have to give
Burnt out, frustrated

I feel like I'm an enemy of the world

If the timing is right
Then I'll turn back the clock
And as the minutes count down
I'll put my trust in this world
Cause this world can't trust in me
I'm holding on
I just can't believe that
All hope is gone
I'm such a wreck without it now
If it's your turn to live
Then it's my turn to give it up

And you bring the heart
Then I'll bring the beat

I'm afraid to be
I stick it out by my heart can't hack it
Just an example of inconsistency
I feel like I'm jaded

I've given it all I have to give
Burnt out, frustrated
I feel like I'm an enemy of the world

I have to take on this world
Cause this world can't take on me
I'm holding on
And as the minutes count down
I'll put my trust in this world
Cause this world can't trust in me
I won't let go
If it's your turn to live
Then it's my turn to give it up
And if you drop the bomb
Then I'll pick it up

If it's your turn to live
Then it's my turn to give it up
And you bring the heart
Then I'll bring the beat

I'm afraid to be
I stick it out by my heart can't hack it
Just an example of inconsistency
I feel like I'm jaded
I've given it all I have to give
Burnt out, frustrated
I feel like I'm an enemy of the world
I'm afraid to be
I stick it out by my heart can't hack it
Just an example of inconsistency
I feel like I'm jaded
I've given it all I have to give
Burnt out, frustrated
I feel like I'm an enemy of the world
