Someone is dancing
On my grave
Sending shivers
Down my spine

I hear a laugh,
it awoke my soul
The wind takes the leaves
where he wants them to go
His tunes enchant our world,
our thoughts and leave us frozen

In this heart of mine,
It's you I find
Take my hand,
I'll take you to the promised land,
you're the one

I hear a laugh,
it awoke my soul,
The wind takes the leaves
where he wants them to go
His tunes, enchant our world,
our thoughts, and leave us frozen

Take my hand,
I'll take you to the promised land

Nevil, whatever you have done,
these tears will fade.
Nevil, wherever you have gone,
please, have faith
