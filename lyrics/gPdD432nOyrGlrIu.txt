The way divides the victim
I won't ask for your permission
I saw dysfunction in your rhythm
Life just slips away
Pass right through the first incision
Everything we are

I'll wait till you've forgotten (I see the way you are)
If you get past the words that (measure unaffected)
(Polarize, insane, fractions that we know)
Quietly effortless just as the summer ends

If you could keep the right commitment
And you put all your hope within him
I saw dysfunction in your rhythm
Life just slips away
Pass right through the first incision
Everything we are

I'll wait till you've forgotten (I see the way you are)
If you get past the words that (measure unaffected)
(Polarize, insane, fractions that we know)
Quietly effortless just as the summer ends

It won't be my decision (Don't wait for me)
I didn't ask for you permission (It won't be long)
No way divides the victim (It rips away)
I didn't ask for your permission (It won't be long)
It won't be my decision (Don't wait for me)
I didn't ask for your permission (It won't be long)
No way divides the victim (It rips away)
I didn't ask for your permission (We connect with something anyway)
