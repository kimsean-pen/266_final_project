Leave out the meaning this time
Let tensions evolve
Intimate groove confused
In childish tantrums

Your feelings were sacrificed for a greater cause
And if you forget what you saw, you'll be forgiven
But there isn't a chance that I could do this on my own

Now our perceptions have grown
Branches and petals of paper and metal
Amber tinfoil forest confines us

And we disconnect like this is the end
We disconnect like this is the end

For everybody else's sake
For everybody else's sake
Set your mental alarm
(If you think it's safe to rely on)

(Let them sleep!)
But there isn't a chance
That I could do this on my...
We do a childish dance.
Your feelings were sacrificed for a greater cause,
And if you forget what you saw, you'll be forgiven
But there isn't a chance
But there isn't a chance

For everybody else's sake
For everybody else's sake
Let tensions evolve
Intimate groove confused in childish tantrums of youth
Let tensions evolve
Intimate groove confused in childish like you always do

Set your mental alarm
If you think it's safe to rely on
If you think it's safe, for everybody else's sake
