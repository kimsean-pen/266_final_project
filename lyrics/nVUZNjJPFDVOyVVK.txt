I got back into town
You tracked me down
Like they said you would

You finally found the time
To apologize
Like they said you should

I won't say that I fell
For some kind of trap
For some sort of scheme

Just that I certainly fell
It doesn't matter why
Doesn't matter how

Why lie, Why lie, Why
We know what you want

I heard you found another girl
To occupy your mind
It's a matter of time

She's the saddest girl that I
That I have ever seen
But you see her in your dreams

Until you wash your hands so clean
We never would have seen
Just leave her in your dreams
