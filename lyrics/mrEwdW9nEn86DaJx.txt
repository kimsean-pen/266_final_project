Oh I'm living
It's a golden thing
It means everything

I'm gifted
By your grace
It's the Swanlights
In the water
On that shining face

Oh it's such a mystery to me
Oh it's such a mystery to me

What I have seen
Faces in my dreams
Oh the Swanlights
The Swanlights

When I close my eyes
And dream Swans come
When in love I lean
On the Swanlight song

Oh it's such a mystery to me
Oh it's such a mystery to me

I'm dancing with their necks
Dancing neck to neck
