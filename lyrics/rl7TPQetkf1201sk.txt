Embrace the silence
Cause there's nothing
That can change the way I feel
Taken all that you wanted
Now there's nothing
That can change the way I feel

Hold on, little girl
The end is soon to come

Sick of it all
Sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all
Sick of it all
They don't understand how
Sick we are
Sick we are
Of this bottomless
Pit of lies
Behind closed eyes

Oceans between us
And there's nothing
That can change the way I feel
I can still taste the poison
Of every fall
Every breath
I wasted here

Hold on, little girl
The end is soon to come

Sick of it all
Sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all
Sick of it all
They don't understand how
Sick we are
Sick we are
Of this bottomless
Pit of lies
Behind closed eyes

Someday you'll know the pain
Someday the light will break through
And nothing you tell yourself
Will save us from the truth

Screaming out

Sick of it all
Sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all
Sick of it all
They don't understand how
Sick we are
Sick we are
Of this bottomless
Pit of lies
Behind closed eyes
