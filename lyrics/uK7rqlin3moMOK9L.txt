Didn't I treat you right now
Didn't I
Didn't I do the best I could
Didn't I
Didn't I give ya everything
Didn't I
I tried my best just to be around
Didn't I

Didn't I do it baby
Didn't I do right
Why you wanna leave me baby
Didn't I treat you right

I want the better things
Everything, that a woman could need
Oh won't ya come closer and hold
Everything was love for me like I want
And back again

Didn't I
Didn't I
Didn't I
Didn't I
Didn't I
Didn't I

There's something wrong with you
Tell Me
Baby are your troubles dead
You look back, you should be glad
Don't be mad, I must be glad
Sit down
and let me kiss ya lovely mouth hey

Didn't I do it baby
Didn't I do right
Why you wanna leave me baby
They say I didn't treat you right

So much to mean to me
That you don't know
Talk to me
