I'm a man, a man of simple pleasures
I got all I need, so give me whisky measures
With dyslexic eyes, seeing very clearly
By the way, I'm on my way
For all of my life, I've been treated like a fool
But I'm no one's fool

Here I go once again trying hard to pretend
There's a future in your man made rules
I'll be governed by the road, get to shed this heavy load

I see no future, so leave me alone in the past

I am told, the world is nearly ending
But when I look outside the birds are always singing
You throw sticks and bones
Remember every dog will have it's day, I'm on my way

For all of my life, I've been treated like a fool
But I'm no one's fool

Here I go once again trying hard to pretend

There's a future in your man made rules
I'll be governed by the road, get to shed this heavy load

I've seen your so future, so leave me alone in the past

Go on, let the righteous guide you home to where you belong
I'll stay, dancing to my favourite tune, that's where I belong

You won't take me for a ride
I'm far too fast for you to keep up with me
You won't take me for a ride
Never catch them really need no money
(I'm not gonna be standing in the line)
(Waiting for you just to kick me out)
You won't take me for a ride
You won't take me for a ride
I'll calm down
