Awake in a dream
Spent my summer awake in a dream
Saw a shrink, I was fourteen
Jane can't see what I came to be (yeah)
Past year disappeared
Spent all night looking for the time
That I washed off, always pay attention to the wrong things, dog
Wrong never felt right, so long, long
Imma go ahead and get ahead while I'm gone
Make enough money not to stress that I'm broke
Dancing on the second floor, elevator coming up slow
I don't give a house vote, know I'm getting old
How many times do I callem psycho?
It's a cycle, I know
Had a falling out over a vinyl bein' broke

You end up wanting something
You're a lot of good for nothing

The best thing about not having you around
I can finally hear myself think out loud
And the trees tall, since I always looked down
And the people ask me what I'm doing, doing now
(Backwoods till my back hurt, Backwoods, out) Doing now
(Backwoods till my back hurt, Backwoods, get on my couch) Doing now
(Backwoods till my back hurt, Backwoods, out) Foing now
(Backwoods till my back hurt, back, back, back hurt, hurt, hurt)

All up on ya, four in the morning
Neighbors like
Haven't thought about it
We don't talk about it like

All up on ya, four in the morning
Neighbors like
Haven't thought about it
We don't talk about it like

Who are you proving yourself to?
Move into the living room
To get away from you
Might sleep out by the pool
This is not a conversation, no
This ain't no debate
Out state, 'round the way
Talk about it, 'nother day maybe

You end up wanting something
You're a lot of good for nothing

The best thing about not having you around (not having you around)
I can finally hear myself think out loud (thinkin' out loud)
And the trees tall, since I always look down
And the people ask me what I'm doing, doing now
(Backwoods till my back hurt, Backwoods, out) Doing now
(Backwoods till my back hurt, Backwoods, get on my couch) Doing now
(Backwoods till my back hurt, Backwoods) Doing now
(Backwoods till my back hurt, Backwoods)
