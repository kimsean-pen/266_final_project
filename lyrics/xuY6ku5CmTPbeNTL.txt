Think about it
Remember when, when we first fell in love
I just want to feel like that again
You know, what it used to be
You and me, listen

I believe we can be whatever we want to be
And I know we'll be alright
I can see what you need and what you need is me
Like you did on my own first night

You make everything lovely
You make everything lovely
You make everything lovely
Yes indeed, that's why I'm hurting

Can we fall in love again?
Like we did back then
Do you remember when?
Do it like you did it back then
And then we'll do it again
Do you remember when?

Reminiscing and more on what we had before
Makes me feel so warm inside
Wanting you constantly and feeling so sorry
That we had to say goodbye

You're my everything, baby
You're my everything, baby
You're my everything, baby
Can't you see that's why I'm hurting

Can we fall in love again?
Like we did back then
Do you remember when?
Do it like you did it back then
And then we'll do it again
Do you remember when?

Maybe we aren't all that we used to be
Maybe we could start from the beginning
You're giving me a love that just cannot leave
So tell me that you still love me

Can we fall in love again?
Like we did back then
Do you remember when?
Do it like you did it back then
And then we'll do it again
Do you remember when?

Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
(You don't do baby)
Do you remember when?
(Do you remember?)

Do you remember?
(Do you remember?)
Do you remember?
(Do you remember?)
Do you remember?
Do you remember when?

Do you remember?
(When we used to touch)
Do you remember?
(When we used to laugh)
Do you remember?
Do you remember when?
(When we used to do the things we used to do)

Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember when?
(Come on do me)
