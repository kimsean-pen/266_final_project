Somewhere in the Kingdom
Of my memory
A mirage of youth
A stream of infancy
You give me half the love I need
And no more!
A little death to laugh

On the left hand path
And I never ever got it back
I give you half the love I need
And no more, yeah!
A little death to laugh
A little death to laugh
A little death to laugh
