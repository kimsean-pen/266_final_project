What if I lead the way?

What if I make mistakes (will you be there?)
What if I change the world?
What if I take the blame (will you be there?)
I remember going back to the place we used to lay

But I keep losing track
And now the days they all turn black
And our dreams all start to fade
But there's no turning back
'Cause the world keeps turning (so why do you tell me you care if you're not gonna stay)

And my heart's still burning (why do you tell me you care)
What if I change the world

If I lead the way?
What if I be the one who takes the blame?
What if I can't go on without you?
What if I graduate?
What if I don't?
What if I don't?
Now I'm slowly giving up

As the world keeps losing faith
And you still turn your back
Now the path I follow takes a toll on me, on you
But there's no turning back.
'Cause the world keeps turning (so why do you tell me you care if you're not gonna stay)

And my heart's still burning (why do you tell me you care)
What if I change the world

If I lead the way?
What if I be the one who takes the blame?
What if I can't go on without you?
What if I graduate?
What if I don't?
What if I don't?
I'll be waiting here

I'll be waiting here
I'll be waiting here
For you to call me
I'll be waiting here

I'll be waiting here
I'll be waiting here
For you to call me
I'll be waiting here

I'll be waiting here
I'll be waiting here
For you to call me
Oh...

What if I lead the way?

What if I graduate?
What if I change the world?
Would you still remember me?
What if I lead the way?
What if I graduate?
What if I change the world
And I found the words to tell you what you mean to me?
I'll be waiting here
I'll be waiting here
I'll be waiting here
For you to call me
I'll be waiting here
I'll be waiting here
I'll be waiting here
