My brother asked me where do you go for love
If you're all alone
Don't you need romance
And I told him, "No I don't"

It's so weird
It's so weird

Then he asked me
Don't you ever need someone
To put your arms around
I said, "Hey there is no replacement
For what is gone"

It's so weird
It's so weird

I tore myself up
For no reward
Behind those heavy doors
And I'm never gonna go back inside
Nothing tripping me up
You can do anything that you want
When you don't belong to anyone

It's so weird
It's so weird

I tore myself up
For no reward
Behind those heavy doors
And I'm never gonna go back inside

Then he looked at me and he said my name
And I didn't know him and I walked away

It's so
It's so weird
