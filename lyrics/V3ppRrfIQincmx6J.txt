many too many
have stood where i stand
many more
will stand here too
the thing that i find strange is the way
you build me up
and knock me down again
oh, it was fun
but now it's over
why cant I
just leave the stage
maybe that's because you securely locked me up
and threw away the key
oh mama
please would you find the key
oh pretty mama
please, wont you let me go free
I thought I was lucky
I thought that I'd got it made
how could i be so blind
you said goodbye on a corner
that I thought led to the straight
you set me on firmly laid and simple course
and then removed the road
oh mama
please help me find my way
oh pretty mama
please lead me through the next day
I thought I was lucky
I thought that I'd got it made
how coould I be so blind
