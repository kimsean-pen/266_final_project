Baby, I don't understand
Why we can't just hold on to each other's hands?
This time might be the last, I fear
Unless I make it all too clear, I need you so, ohh...
Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
Learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings...

Baby, I think tonight
We can take what was wrong and make it right. hmm

Baby, it's all I know
That you're half of the flesh
And blood makes me whole
I need you so...
So take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
And learn to live life so free.
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in.

Take these broken wings
You've got to learn to fly
Learn to live life so free

And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up
And let us in. Ya ya

And let us in.
And let us in.

Baby, it's all I know
That you're half of the flesh
And blood makes me whole, ya ya ya
Ya ya
So take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
Learn to live so free

And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up
And let us in

Take these broken wings
You've got to learn to fly
Learn to live so free

And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up
And let us in, ya ya
Ya ya
