It's the nature of time that the old ways must give in
It's the nature of time that the new ways comes in sin
When the new meets the old it always ends the ancient ways
And as history told, the old ways go out in a blaze

Encircled by a vulture
The end of ancient culture
The dawn of destiny draws near

Imperial force defied
Facing five hundred samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
Sixty to one, the sword face the gun
Bushido dignified
It's the last stand of the samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered

As a new age begins, the way of the warrior comes to an end
As a new age begins, the ways of old must apprehend
It's the nature of time, that the old ways must give in
It's the nature of time, that the new ways comes in sin

An offer of surrender
Saigo ignore contender
The dawn of destiny is here

Imperial force defied
Facing five hundred samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
Sixty to one, the sword face the gun
Bushido dignified
It's the last stand of the samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered

Till the dawn they hold on
Only forty are left at the end
None alive, none survive, Shiroyama

Imperial force defied
Facing five hundred samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
Sixty to one, the sword face the gun
Bushido dignified
It's the last stand of the samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
Sixty to one, facing the gun
Sixty to one, culture undone
