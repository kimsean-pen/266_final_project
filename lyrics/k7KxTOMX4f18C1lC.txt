Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it
Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it
At the bosom
Or the breast
Or the forehead
Or the fist

Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it
Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it
My mouthing at you
My tongue the stake
I should welt should I hold you
I should gash should I kiss you

Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it

Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it

Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it

Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it
