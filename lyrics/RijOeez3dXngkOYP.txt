Play me down my lover
Like we're undercover
Like we're in our freshman year
Like all the girls and boys in school
Our anticipation
And our bad behaving
It's like we learned our lesson
But conveniently forgot the rules

Questions for questions
I've got a question
Would you ever dance with me like that
Questions for questions
I've got a question
Would you ever dance with me like that

I don't want your lover
Like my younger brother
He's patronized another
But I think it's serious this time
I don't want you fading
Acting like you hate me
It's just like all your paper cuts
They cut you in the coldest spots

Questions for questions
I've got a question
Would you ever dance with me like that
Questions for questions
I've got a question
Would you ever dance with me like that
Fuck all the rest and forget the rules
Like all the girls and boys in my school
Questions for questions
I've got a question
Would you ever dance with me like that

I said to this end
Don't hurt your best friend
I said to this end
Don't hurt your best friend
I said to this end
Don't hurt your best friend
I said to this end
Don't hurt your best friend

Questions for questions
I've got a question
Would you ever dance with me like that

Questions for questions
I've got a question
Would you ever dance with me like that
Fuck all the rest and forget the rules
Like all the girls and boys in my school
Questions for questions
I've got a question
Would you ever dance with me like that

Would you ever
Would you ever
Would you ever
Would you ever
Keep playing along again
