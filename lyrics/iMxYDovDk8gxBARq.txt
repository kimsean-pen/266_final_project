Open your mind dont let it slip,
And take you on a midnight ride that's wicked
Everyone around here comes in feeling
fed up with the way their wounds are healin'
Take me to a place where doors are open
A lovely little place where no one's broken
Welcome to the world of "no one's listening"
Just wanna break out and escape this prison,

Bring me to life.
Breathe air into me,
It's taken me my whole life to realize
All the things I've never seen,
Bring me to life.
Breathe air into me,
Take me from the darkness that I've been in
'Cause I just wanna be free,

Bring me to life!

Come on start your engines.
Flip that switch,
And take you to the limit if you ride like this,
And if you feel alive then pump your fists,
'Cause there's no turnin' back, when the energy hits,
Down comes the rain like a hurricane,
Hard to breathe like a storm hangin' over me,
Comin' to get me but I don't have to let it in,
I stand up - face my fears like an enemy,

Bring me to life.
Breathe air into me,
It's taken me my whole life to realize
All the things I've never seen,
Bring me to life.
Breathe air into me,
Take me from the darkness that I've been in
'Cause I just wanna be free,

And I've been wanting to break out,
You helped me figure out,
That I could come to life,
And turn this thing around

Been wanting to break out
You helped me figure out
That I could come to life
And turn this thing around

Shut it, if you're talkin' to me
I'm sick and tired of all your lies
And what you want me to be

Just shut it, if you're talkin' to me,
I'm sick and tired of all the lies,
And what you want me to be

Just shut it! if you're talkin' to me,
I'm sick and tired of all the lies,
And what you want me to be

Just shut it! if you're talkin' to me,
I'm sick and tired of all the lies,
And what you want me to be

What you want me to be

Bring me to life.
Breathe air into me,
It's taken me my whole life to realize
All the things I've never seen,
Bring me to life.
Breathe air into me,
Take me from the darkness that I've been in
'Cause I just wanna be free,
