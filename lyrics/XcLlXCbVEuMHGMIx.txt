I'm a down south Florida boy, ain't goin' back to Hollywood
From the gutter to your guts, let me ignite the firewood
Still I roll slow in the Chevy donk
Never forget where I rose up from,
spit on my face, get rid of my funds
And who am I? Just another guy stuck in desperation
Lookin' at the ceilin' fan, spinnin' around, havin' a panic attack
I don't pop no pills 'cause it don't take the pain away from me
I don't crack no seals 'cause it done took the gang away from me
I been known to pimp a ho, got dirty loafers on my feet
Bitch you got me mesmerized, them thighs the size of me
Lemme slide inside yo body beef, bitch
I got my chain on, ain't a thing wrong with a broken frozen wrist
Them suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away
Another day I piss away, another day don't go my way
Another ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase
But bitch I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another
Them suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away
Another day I piss away, another day don't go my way
Another ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase
But bitch I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another
Everything I did is crumblin' beneath my feet
I'm feelin' lonely, feelin' like I'm only stuck with memories
Take me back to what I was, take away what I've become
Take away the grayer days, take the bullet out my brain
Take my dick out your mouth and let me be myself
I wonder what the people around me think about me
Back to my shady ways I go
Pack the Gat and let it blow
Just let my lover, brother, mother, sisters, father know I love 'em
Mikey I told told you we was gon be somethin'
Look at us now 'cause now we buzzin', pressin' buttons
Diamonds dancin' by the dozen
Nick I told you we would rise from nothin'
Look at the way they look at me now
Rich forever, blowin' money 'til I'm senile
Them suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away
Another day I piss away, another day don't go my way
Another ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase
But bitch I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another
Them suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away
Another day I piss away, another day don't go my way
Another ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase
But bitch I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another
I got addicted to the money as I fell inside a hole
The cries and crowd get louder, the deeper that I go
Nobody know what I've been doin', tell myself I hate myself
I can't control the cards I'm dealt
I spent a lot time alone inside my room
Thinkin' about what I do if I knew
you was on the fence about me too, bitch
I crashed the whip and hit a bitch, and almost killed the bitch
An now I'm back in the Cadillac with that black pistol grip
The AC don't work and I'm feelin' like I was kid again
Feelin' like I wasn't gettin' in with the cooler kids
How the fuck can I get out of this funk?
If I die, you cry, then move on, the next day
I'm ill advised, fuck you, bitch, you can't even look me in my eyes
Them suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away
Another day I piss away, another day don't go my way
Another ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase
But bitch I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another
Them suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away
Another day I piss away, another day don't go my way
Another ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase
But bitch I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another
Them suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away
Fade away, fade away.
