One day, when the world is set to rights
I'm going to murder all the people I don't like
The people who have left me down without reserve
The people who are cruel to those that don't deserve
The people who talk too much
The people who don't care
The people whose lives are going
nowhere
The people who just give in
The people who don't fight
The people I don't like
The people who broke my heart so bad it never mends
The people who wrecked my life all my so-called friends
The people who don't know when to forget forgive.
These are the people who do not deserve to live.
The people who talk too much, The people who don't care
The people whose lives just leave me crying in despair
The people who told me I was wrong they were right
The people I don't like.
