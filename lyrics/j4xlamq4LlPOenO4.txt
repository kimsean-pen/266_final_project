Now the flames (they followed) they followed Joan of Arc
As she came riding through the dark (through the dark)
(No) No moon to keep her armor bright (armor bright)
(No) No man (to) to get her through this
Very smoky night (through this smoky night)

She said, "I'm tired of the war (ooh)
I want the kind of work I had before (ooh)
With a wedding dress or something white (ooh)
To wear upon my swollen appetite"

La-da-da, la-da-da...
La-la-la-la...
La-la-la-la...
La-la-la...

Well, I'm glad to to hear you talk this way (ooh)
You know I've watched you riding every day
'N something in me yearns to win
Such a cold and lonesome heroine

"And who are you?" she sternly spoke (ooh)
To the one beneath the smoke (ooh)
"Why, I'm fire," he replied
"And I love your solitude
And I love your pride"

La-da-da, la-da-da...
La-la-la-la...
La-la-la-la...
La-la-la...

"Then fire, make your body cold
I'm gonna give you mine to hold"
Saying this she climbed inside
To be his one, to be his only bride

And deep into his fiery heart (ooh)
He took the dust of Joan of Arc
And high above the wedding guests
He hung the ashes of her wedding dress

La-da-da, la-da-da...
La-la-la-la...
La-la-la-la...
La-la-la...

It was deep into his fiery heart (ooh)
He took the dust of Joan of Arc
And then she clearly understood
If if he was fire (ooh)
Oh, she then she must be wood

(I saw) I saw her wince, I saw her cry (ooh)
I saw the glory in her eye (in her eye)
Myself (I long) I long for love and light (and light)
(But must) but must it come so cruel (so cruel)
And oh so bright? (And oh so bright?)

La-da-da, la-da-da...
La-la-la-la...
La-la-la-la...
La-la-la...
