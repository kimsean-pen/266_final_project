Unbalance starts to rise within the population, revolution begins
A hunger for power is launched, their dreams: becoming the leader of the alliance
A hidden disturbance is felt throughout the community, its force augments
The stakes are increasing, tension is high, a clash of the titans begins to shed reality on the realm

Guidance ignored, they strive to achieve their goals

Opponents will grow
They will plan a future
Disregarding lives
To focus on their desires
The end of a race begins

Allies will assist
Honour is revealed
Some will return
Others will rest in war
A new world defined in tears

A new world defined in tears

Trying to achieve order in the senate: seeking the moles
Members are few who do provide selflessly, aiming to conquer vengeance of man
Rebels increase their offense, they wear their masks to climb the ranks
Their plans rehearsed, the walk alone soldiers see the paths intent
They disagree but voiceless words are heard

Guidance ignored, the wisdom is overlooked

Opponents will grow
They will plan a future
Disregarding lives
To focus on their desires
The end of a race begins

Allies will assist
Honour is revealed
Some will return
Others will rest in war
A new world defined in tears

A new world defined in tears

Undercover violence with worshipping power
Unrestricted support for loyalty at large

Answers are few, questions open ended
Conflict nearby, the pressure is rising
Violence closing in on the inhabitants
Silence calls the storm
