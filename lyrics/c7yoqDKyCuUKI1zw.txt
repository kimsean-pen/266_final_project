Virus
When every hour, could be the last
Why would we wait
Why would we wait
And every road, could be unsafe
But we'll be okay
We'll make it
We'll make it
It's just who we are
Say rather go
And I know that I wont slow down
It's just who we are
Yeah we can do anything we dream about
How about now
How about now
How about now
How about now
Virus
How about now
How about now
How about now
How about now
