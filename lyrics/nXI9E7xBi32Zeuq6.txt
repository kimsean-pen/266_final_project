I miss your brain...
The way you think
But I don't miss...
The way you used to drink!

I miss our talks...
The universal law
You had a way...
Of seeing through my flaws!

It's so confusing!
I thought I met my match
An intellectual, what a talent!
What a catch!

You always said...
We'd be better off as friends
It was inevitable...
That it would end!

Your picture's... off my wall!
But I'm still... waiting for your call!
And every man that walks through that door...
Will be compared to you forevermore!

Still I have... no regrets!
'Cause I survived the... biggest test!
I cannot lie!
And I won't pretend!
But I feel like I lost my... very best friend!

I miss the countryside where we used to lay
The smell of roses on a lovely summer day
You made me laugh...
You had a clever wit!
I miss the good times, I don't miss all of it!

You wrote me poetry, you had a way with words!
You said you wanted more than just a pretty girl!
Maybe I challenged you a little bit too much!
We couldn't have two drivers on the clutch!

Your picture's... off my wall!
But I'm still... waiting for your call!
And every man that walks through that door...
Will be compared to you forevermore!

Still I have... no regrets!
'Cause I survived the... biggest test!
I cannot lie!
And I won't pretend!
But I feel like I lost my... very best friend!

Yet I have...
No regrets!
'Cause I survived the... biggest test!
I cannot lie!
And I won't pretend!
But I feel like I lost my very best friend!

It's so sad that it had to end!
I lost my... very best friend! (Lost my very best friend!)
Not gonna candy coat it!
And I don't want to pretend!

I put away your letters, saved the best ones that I had
It wasn't always perfect!
But it wasn't always bad!

Still I have... no regrets!
'Cause I survived the... biggest test!
I cannot lie!
And I won't pretend!
But I feel like I lost my... very best friend!

Yet I have...
No regrets!
'Cause I survived the biggest test!
I will not lie!
And I can't pretend!
But I feel like I lost my very best friend!

It's so sad that it had to end!
