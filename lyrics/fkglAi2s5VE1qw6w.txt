Let them sing on my final hour
The sound of choirs lift me up from my sea of sins
So let them sing the anthem of death

This is my call to arms, a final gasping breath
The wind is roaring through the anthem of my death
And I hope that the choirs of absolution
Will sing me to sleep when my time is over
I know that my days are numbered
Three, two, one, we won't live forever
I'll go towards the neverending
I lay my head to rest while the choirs are singing

Let it be the sound that you remember
When they sink me down underneath the ground
Will the memories of me still weigh me down?
Let it be the voice of absolution
That sets me free
Only darkness awaits for the ones who will not see

Only death awaits for the weak
Sing me to sleep

I feel the cold surround me
Wherever I may turn, I feel the wrath inside me
I've been living my life without my eyes
And I never felt the warmth from the sun on the skyline
I am sorry for everything
For every drop in the sea of my sins
With the death grip on me
I lay my head to rest while the choirs are singing

Let it be the sound that you remember
When they sink me down underneath the ground
Will the memories of me still weigh me down?
Let it be the voice of absolution
That sets me free
Only darkness awaits for the ones who will not see

Let them sing, let their dead hearts sink here at the neverending
I have a life, but I never been living
So close my eyes 'cause I never been seeing
It's like my heart has never been beating
Sing me to sleep in the end, only death awaits
Sing me to sleep
