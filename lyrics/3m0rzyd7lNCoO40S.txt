Don't have to be the prettiest
If you have the mind and willingness
No one stops
A girl who knows what she's got

No reason why
I can't help following with my eyes
Even at my best
I guess I'm still just one of them

I see it all in my head
Cool hands on your sweat
You wanna make me mad?
Stop 'cause I am

A combination of strong and lust
How easily you turn, then turn it off
Do you take what you want
And save it for a better time?

Don't act that way
Honey, I don't buy it at all
If you're really as tough as your defenses
You let them fall

I see it all in my head
The cool hands on your sweat
You wanna make me mad?
Stop 'cause I am

You can call this a game
You can look at my face
You wanna hurt me, baby?
Stop 'cause you have

I see it all in my head
The cool hands on your sweat
You wanna make me mad?
Stop 'cause I am

You can call this a game
And you can look at my face
You wanna hurt me, baby?
Stop 'cause you have

You wanna see me mad?
Stop 'cause I am
You wanna hurt me, baby?
Stop 'cause you have
