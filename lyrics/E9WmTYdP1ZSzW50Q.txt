She told me she was hollow
that's far from what I see
She's more than just the daughter of a broken man to me

She told me she was shallow
Her rivers run so deep
If I could only be the boat that leads her to the sea

But Lonely is her favourite place to be
When she feels the hurt she lets it bleed
Sometimes She's lost, sometimes She's broken
Sometimes She's closed, sometimes She's open
Lonely is her favourite place to be

She told me she was falling,
I offered her my hand
But She only finds her comfort in not
knowing just how hard she's gonna land

I told her she was special
She almost let me in
But she couldn't bare the thought of
digging up the heart that she'd been burying

Lonely is her favourite place to be
When she feels the hurt she lets it bleed
Sometimes She's lost, sometimes She's broken
Sometimes She's closed, sometimes She's open
Lonely is her favourite place to be

Lonely is her favourite
If only I could change it
If I could only save her

Lonely is her favourite
If only I could change it
If I could only save her

But sometimes She's lost, sometimes She's broken
Sometimes She's closed, sometimes She's open
Sometimes She's stone cold
At times She's on fire
Mostly She's everything I desire
lonely is her favourite place to be
lonely is her favourite place to be
She told me she was Hollow
