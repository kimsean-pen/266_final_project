When will we fall?
Silence over us all
Seek peace in chains
Rapt in exchange

Somewhere farther we both know
Take me higher than you'll go
Stuck in feeling something real
Skeptic to a new ideal

Motion to foreign fields
Motion to foreign fields
Motion to foreign fields
Foreign fields

Lost in our mood
Afraid to feel truth
Succumb to your youth
Melt in to seclude
Velvet touch to swollen brace
Languorous movements we both make
Lithe perception, who is to blame?

Oscillate until we break
Motion to foreign fields
Motion to foreign fields
Motion to foreign fields

Foreign fields
Motion to foreign fields
Motion to foreign fields
Motion to foreign fields
Foreign fields

How did we get
How did we get here?
How did we get
How did we get here?
How did we get
How did we get here?
How did we get
How did we get here?

Motion to foreign fields
(How did we get?)
Motion to foreign fields
(How did we get here?)
Motion to foreign fields
(How did we get?)
Foreign fields
(How did we get here?)

Motion to foreign fields
(How did we get?)
Motion to foreign fields
(How did we get here?)
Motion to foreign fields
(How did we get?)
Foreign fields
