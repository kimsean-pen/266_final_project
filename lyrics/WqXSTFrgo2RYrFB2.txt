Early hours, open road, family of five - on their way home!
Having enjoyed a day in the sun, their encounter with gore has just begun!
A homicidal fool not knowing left from right, now has the family in his sight,
Trying to perceive if he's blind or insane,
he steers his car into the other lane!

Both of them collide! Expressions horrified!
Head on at full speed, the vultures will soon feed!

The father of three was impaled on the wheel,
as his skull became a part of the dash!
Eyeballs ejected and sight uneffected, he saw his own organs collapse!
His seatbelt was useless for holding him back, it simply cut him in two!
Legs were crushed, out leaked pus as his spinal cord took off and flew!
Mother took flight through the glass, ended up impaled on a sign!
Her intestines stretched from the car down the road for a quarter of a mile!

Fourth child on the way, won't live another day!
Fetus on the road, with mangled little bones,
Little children fly, not a chance to wonder why!
Smashed against the ceiling, all their skin burning and peeling!
Shards of glass explode, chest and skull now implode!
Corpses they've become, graves will have to be, dug!

Underneath the wheels, burning rubber on your face!
Bleeding from your eyes, the slaughtered victims lies!
Knowing what he's done, he just backs up one more time,
Laughing at the mess, a pile of meat on the street!

One child left, slowly dying now, arteries gushing blood!
Now it's time to feed on flesh, the gore has just begun!
One child left, slowly dying now, arteries gushing blood!
Now it's time to feed on flesh, the gore has just begun!

The look of death in my eye!
Surely no-one will survive!
Just a pile of mush,
Left to dry in the sun!

See my fresh kill,
Left in the road,
Remains of your bodies,
Mangled and, torn!
