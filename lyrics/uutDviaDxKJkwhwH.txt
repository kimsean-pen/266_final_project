Kiss Away My Fear!

Can't Sleep, Get No Relief,
I Really Miss All The Things That I Need.
I Feel Inside Out,
Do You Know What I Was Dreaming About?
Of Kids And Kings,
Of Thieves And Prince,
Of Knockers And Pimps,
Of Kicks And Kisses.

Kiss Away My Fear Tonight,
You Stole My Soul, Rock Me All Over,
I'm Awake And Up All Night,
Yes, I Want You To Want Me All Over!
And Over!
Yes, I Want You All Over!

Come Close, Closer To Me,
The Hardest Thing And The Highest Degree.
I Really Feel Upside Down,
I Know You'll Bring Me Back To The Ground.
With Shifts And Spins,
With Style And Schemes,
With Hope And Sins,
With Kicks And Kisses.

Kiss Away My Fear Tonight,
You Stole My Soul, Rock Me All Over,
I'm Awake And Up All Night,
Yes, I Want You To Want Me All Over!
And Over!
Yes, I Want You All Over!
To Want Me All Over!

Kiss Away My Fear!
