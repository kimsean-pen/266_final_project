I have never craved the system's sympathy
I get restless over pity smiles
Some precaution wouldn't harm my history
If I had the will to wait a little while

You cut the silence like a knife
You know I can't repent for all

Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you

could not compete with my pride
Compensation for a misconducted life
Is it way to much to ask
Hard to wake up
With your heart and soul deprived
When the morning comes

The decond to your last
You cut the silence like a knife
Like the edge of my last defense
You cut the silence like a knife

You know I won't repent for all
Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me

Just like you could not compete with my pride
Shine on silver

From the sky into the night
Gaia shivers
And I need your leading light
Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with my pride
Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with our pride
