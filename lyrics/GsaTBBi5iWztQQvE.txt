In an hour of the night
I hear summoning voices
And wake from my funeral sleep.

In time before light
In crypts of eternal deep

Dust from my grave
Blew away with the wind

On a cryptic journey
Onto the other side.

Beneath the mountain
And pass beyond the gate below...

The eternity opens...

Floating evil reign
With fear in the sarcasctive caves.

Enlightened into a blacker dark.
For there are views of darkness.

The light is searching to save the soul of mine.
It's blind and can't see the gate to immortality.

Hornsbells hail my soul.
The gate is all I've known.

ahhh The eternity opens.

Floating evil reign
With fear in the sarcasctive caves.

Enlightened
Into a blacker dark.
For there are views of darkness.

The light will dissapear
It was never here.

As the eternity opens.

Floating evil reign

Enlightened

As the eternity opens.

Light will dissapear
It was never here.

As the eternity opens.

Light will dissapear
It was never here.

As the eternity opens.
