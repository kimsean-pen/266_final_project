In the water, fire
I'll go wherever you go
In the valley, in the canyon
I'll go wherever you go

Hey, love, I'm ready now
Can't you see this riot
Inside of my veins

Hey love, I'm overcome
By desire
How must I wait?

In the water (The water),
The fire (The fire)
I'll go wherever you go
In the valley, in the canyons
I'll go wherever you go

Hey, love, it's been three years now
Since you heard from Jesus
Of His chosen man

Hey love, you'll twist and turn
'Til your colors wither
Then there'll be no man

In the water (The water),
The fire (The fire)
I'll go wherever you go
In the valley, in the canyons
"ll go wherever you go
In the water (The water), the fire (The fire)
I'll go wherever you go
In the valley, in the canyon
I'll go wherever you go

Oh, Lebanon, life is brief
Don't sit alone in your constant fear
Open up, I shan't be like Canada
Oh, Lebanon
Oh, Lebanon, life is brief
Don't sit alone
In your constant fear
Open up, I shan't be like Canada
