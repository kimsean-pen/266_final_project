I've been waiting for so long for your love
Oh, don't you know, don't you know
I've been waiting for so long?

I've been waiting for so long, for so long
Won't you bring it to me?
I've been waiting for so long, for so long
Won't you bring it to me?

I was in the checkout line
Checking out the mighty fine
By the time I got to the parking lot
I took home more than what I bought

You're my tenderness, my chocolate drop
Don't you ever let your good lovin' stop
I said, "Don't you ever let your good lovin' stop
Don't you ever let your good lovin' stop"

Bring me your love
Stay here with me
Bring me your love
I'll be right here, waiting for you

You're my tenderness, my chocolate drop
Don't you ever let your good lovin' stop

Bring me, bring me, bring me your love
I'll be right here waiting for you
I'll be right here waiting for you
