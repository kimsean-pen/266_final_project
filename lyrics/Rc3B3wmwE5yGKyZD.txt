well i wake up another day
knowing i lost you along the way
when you came for me i was not ready
when you called i was not able to move
when i ran from you i lost my head
thought i couldn't belong to anyone
and the anger flowed like a river
and the water tasted like your love
but we're gonna run
and we'll chase the sun
all the way back to the west
where we're from
how could a name carry so much weight?
i hear it calling me awake
i hear the rhythm of your heart
oh my daddy you tear me apart
oh my daddy, my desert star
must be so lovely wherever you are
and your flame it stays inside my head
it makes everything else so dim
but we're gonna run
and we'll chase the sun
all the way back to the west
where we're from
