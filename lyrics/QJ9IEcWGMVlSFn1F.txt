Shame on you
Watch you spit on your mother's grave
Shaved, I shave there too
Where you, you came from your mother

In life, lies lay on the side of fools
To wear the skin of a foal

A newborn blood
A newborn truth
Who could blend into summer's fall
Back out in winter's wall

Skin
What you wear
Is a foal
Is a half bare
Skin
Is a life
As in sin
Is a half lie

Skin
Who you dare
To see fall
To see nowhere

Skin
Press the knife
Make a wish
Meet me halfway there

Meet me halfway there

When I fall out of this life
I fall into skin

Skin
What you wear
Is a foal
Is a half bare

Skin
Is a life
As in sin
Is a half lie

Skin
Who you dare
To see fall
To see nowhere

Skin
Press the knife
Make a wish
Meet me halfway there
