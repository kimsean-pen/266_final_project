Everyday it's getting worse not better
Maybe we should sit and finally talk
'Cause where we're at it's hard to measure
When I'm standing in front of a wall, yeah

You wanna know why I look sad and lonely?
You wanna know why I can barely talk?
Well, it's not your fault, so let me say I'm sorry
For making you the reason for my fall

I wish that I could be like I was before
I was riding high but now I'm feeling so low
I wish that you could make my world feel better
And take away the hurt so I won't be so far gone, yeah

I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

You always hurt the people closest to ya
Guess I blamed you for everything wrong
And I don't know why it's so hard to tell ya
I guess that's why I'm writing you this song, yeah

You wanna know why I look sad and lonely?
You wanna know why I can barely talk?
Well, it's not your fault, so let me say I'm sorry
For making you the reason for my fall

I wish that I could be like I was before
I was riding high but now I'm feeling so low
I wish that you could make my world feel better
And take away the hurt so I won't be so far gone, yeah

I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

I wish that I could be like I was before
I was riding high but now I'm feeling so low
I wish that you could make my world feel better
And take away the hurt so I won't be so far gone

I wish that I could be like I was before
I was riding high but now I'm feeling so low
I wish that you could make my world feel better
And take away the hurt so I won't be so far gone, yeah

I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish, yeah
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish
