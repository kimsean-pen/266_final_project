Hand with the force bitch they call me Saber
Horns out now a nigga Satan learn yo
Lesson 'cause the flow is so demonic
Reading niggas like I'm hooked on Phonics I'm a
Money talker I don't speak ebonics
Flows with me, hoes with me, you don't wanna
Smoke, you down the wrong chimney
Did my money dance so watch a nigga shimmy, these niggas they
Sweet they frosting egg milk baking flour
Pussy beats me lunch then [?] devoured
Heat seek niggas looking for a target
Man up nigga finish what you started
Look in your eyes, shoot shoot no flies
Coming straight from Buffalo, like a Bison, soaring the
Sky and I moonwalk horizons, I'm your
Demise, new niggas start jogging, hold on

Fucking with the horned one that nigga's a

Hailing from the West to the East rap game is a
Feast, (yeah), laughing while you
Starve don't bark when I eat fuck nigga
