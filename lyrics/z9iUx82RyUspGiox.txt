Ah
Me and Mine we'll be alright
Long as she's standing at my side
Long as she's loving me
Mine and me we'll be unified

Me, me, me and mine
Me, me, me and mine
Me, me, me and mine
Me, me, me and mine

Mine and me, you and me oh
Looks like the echos runnin' low
Personal hope you weren't home
Too many...? ...alone
Me, me, me and Mine
Me, me, me and Mine
Me, me, me and Mine
Me, me, me and Mine
