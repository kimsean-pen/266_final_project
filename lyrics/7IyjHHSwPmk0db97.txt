When I was in the 7th grade
I fell in love with a girl
I'm almost 20 years old
And I'm still in love with this girl

I wanna make love like the 80s
I wanna fuck you in your room
and make babies

I'd fuck you if you would just let me
I fuck you in my new Mercedes

I want you to know I'm the best
Want you to know I'd make your pussy wet
If you'd laid down in my bed
If you lay down in my bed, down in my bed

I'm not fucking with you anyway
Been tryna fuck you since the 7th grade

Bitch can you tell that I'm high right now?
I don't know if you're my type right now

I fucked you in a dream once

I saw the moonlight on your titties
There is no love in the heart of the city
I fucking dare you: come get me

There's dangers within me

I think of you, getting choked up
Dairy Queen bathroom floor getting coked up
Gimme five minutes and I'll blow my brains out
First you break the peepee
then I'll whip the chains out

I'm sneaking inside of your bedroom
and telling you
Even though I tried
there's still no forgetting you
I swear to God
I thought I would stop loving you
My dick gets hard when I'm near you
IM FUCKING YOU

Are you fucking with me?
Ima fuck you like it's 2003
Ima fuck you like I did in my dream,
Ima fuck you like I did in my dream

Are you thinking of me tonight?
I've been thinking bout you since forever
Forever

Are you thinking of me tonight?
I've been thinking bout the two of us
Together, together

Will you let me in your bed?
Will you let me in your bed?
Tonight? Tomorrow?
Forever, forever

Will you let me in your bed?
Will you let me in your bed?

Shout out, shorty
Shout out, shorty
What do you mean it ain't realer to me?
Go ahead and breath into deeply of me
Deep in my queen center ass in my tomb
Skinny D suckin my dick after school
FaceTime it to ya so you know that it's real
I know you remember

I was the way
I was the one for the longest
My dick is the strongest
I died for my squadron

My only question is Where Are You Now?
Breakin the night
With this blade in mouth
And this hate in my scalp

Looking like Cool Runnins
Keep up this act and you'll have me bawling
I think I'm falling
But will I see you?

Are you thinking of me tonight?
I've been thinking bout the two of us
Together, together

Will you let me in your bed?
Will you let me in your bed?
Tonight? Tomorrow?
Forever, forever

Will you let me in your bed?
Will you let me in your bed?

Our love is like 2001
I know that it's forever
