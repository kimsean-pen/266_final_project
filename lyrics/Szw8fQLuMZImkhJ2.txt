She looked at me, her eyes were watering
That's when I knew that this was about to end
Frozen in that moment, time was standing still
And I could feel my heart sinking and fragile

Goodbye, she said
I went and found some body new

But I gave you every waking moment
I gave you everything you wanted
And now, my love, you're giving me up.

She walked away and I could hardly breathe
I turned around and fell down to my knees
Shivering as the truth is settling
Her tomorrow has nothing to do with me

I knew some day,
that you'd find someone else's lips
But before you go,
could you just leave me one last kiss?

'Cause I gave you every waking moment
I gave you everything you wanted
And now, my love, you're giving me up.

And I can't lie still
When there's someone else beside you
And I can't lie still
'Cause I'm all alone this time,
'Cause I'm all alone this time,
I'm all alone this time.

I remember when you were falling
And I was there just holding on to you
And I remember all those
Scars I wear that you carved in me

And I gave you every waking moment
I gave you everything you wanted
And now, my love, has given me up.

And I can't lie still
When there's someone else beside you
And I can't lie still
Cause I'm all alone this time,
Cause I'm all alone this time,
I'm all alone this time.
