Return to the earth
Rain on black clouds
Return to the earth
Return to birth

Wasn't technically perfect
Couldn't have been any better
Was the fall worth it?
I don't feel any better

And you were so sick
You were skin and bones
So you fed yourself excuses
Just to keep it going
Nodding on and on
(Nodding on and on)
Raining on and on
(Raining on and on)

So keep on slipping 'til the end of the earth
Like a ghost sinking into the ground
Keep on slipping 'til the end of the earth
Now that all these black clouds
Keep on raining down

Wasn't technically perfect
Couldn't have been any better
Falling faster and faster
Do you still feel clever?
Couldn't stop the momentum
Couldn't stop you from crashing
Wish that I had seen it coming

And you were so sick
You were skin and bones
So you fed yourself excuses
Just to keep it going
Nodding on and on
(Nodding on and on)
(Nodding on and on)
Raining on and on
(Raining on and on)

So keep on slipping 'til the end of the earth
Do you remember what was said?
You could lose the sleep
All of those nauseous things
Oh, are you alive?
It didn't take long
I'd bring you back to Earth

Return to the earth
And if you come down
Return to the earth

So keep on slipping 'til the end of the earth
Like a ghost sinking into the ground
Keep on slipping 'til the end of the earth
Now that all these black clouds
Keep on raining
