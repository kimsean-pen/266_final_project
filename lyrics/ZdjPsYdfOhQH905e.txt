From another time
On the other side
Such a strange connection
To the afterlife
Direct discussion
With the men in white
The candelabra burns to send
My love to you
In loving memory
Life is haulted
In the gridded vault
Marble slabs and placards of a
Grave gestalt
Knew you'd like the roses
Even though we know they
Wont last
It's been a year today but it's
Hard to say
When I watched you pass
You might be right behind
Behind the wall today
I couldn't feel your soul
I watched it leave your frame
You might be right behind
Behind the wall today
I put my hand on your name
It never could be the same
In the wall can you feel the
Ocean breeze
Now you can talk to them
You'll be loved
Where you are now
You'll be loved
Where you are now
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
You might be right behind
Behind the wall today
I couldn't feel your soul
I watched it leave your frame
You might be right behind
Behind the wall today
I put my hands on your name
It never could be the same
And I might be right behind the
Wall behind this wall today
I couldn't feel your soul
I watched it leave your frame
And I might be right behind the
Wall behind this wall today
I put my hand on your name
It never could be the same

I'll see you in due time...
