Traitor, I used to call you friend and I let you in
But now the ones I love have become strangers
I will never trust again
You won the battle, but this is my war
It's not the end

You won the battle, but this is my war
It's not the end
This is a call for revenge
I pledge my allegiance, bound to vengeance
This is a call for revenge
You won the battle, but this is my war
It's not the end

This is overdue, don't be confused
This is not an apology
I want you to feel the pain you put me through
(But you're afraid to acknowledge me)
So alone, no hope, no peace, just cope
You call out for help but no one is home

Living in my own mind
I've been trying to find
The last nail in the casket
Will I ever learn to forgive and forget
I tried to bury the hatchet
But it's buried deep inside my back

Traitor, I used to call you friend and I let you in
But now the ones I love have become strangers
I will never trust again
You won the battle, but this is my war
It's not the end

And I'll be damned if I let you win
This is a call for revenge
I pledge my allegiance
Bound to vengeance
Bound to vengeance
I can't escape these memories
I'm bound, bound to vengeance

I've been trying to find
The last nail in the casket
Will I ever learn to forgive and forget
I tried to bury the hatchet
But it's buried deep, deep inside my back

Lay it to rest
It's like pulling teeth
Trying to forget what you did to me
The last nail in the casket
Lay it to rest
It's like pulling teeth
Trying to forget what you took from me
The last nail in the casket
Lay it to rest
