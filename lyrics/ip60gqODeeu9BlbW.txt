I have been waiting all of my life
For you to come along and make everything alright
My body's shaking right through my bones,
So take me by the hand please don't leave me here alone.
And I wonder if you know just how I feel, I feel.
Yeah and I wonder how I know if this is real, is real.
'Cause I want you to save me, just please save me, save me.
'Cause I need you to save me, just please save me, save me.
