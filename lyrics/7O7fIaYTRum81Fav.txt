You ask me where I'd go tonight
I'd go back to today last year
We knew how to make each other happy
And there was hope of everything
It's hard enough to feel the world as it is
And hold on anything
Without these quiet times
You've bought round here

I'm gonna to have to run away
I'm sure that I belong some other place
I've seen another side of all I've seen
It keeps me wondering where my family is
It's hard enough to see the world as it is
And hold on anything
Without these quiet times
Coming round here

Now I miss you
And I want you
But I can't have you
Even when you're here

I suppose I have to take you with me broken mind
I'd rather leave you here
So forget everything you've seen and known
Erase every idea
If you walk up in the street
And hold my hand and smile
Well I won't be taken in
Cos I know how it turns out
And it takes me back
To these quiet times
Coming round here

Now I miss you
And I want you
You're not coming back
And I need you
But I can't have you
Even when you're here

Now I miss you
And I want you
You're not coming back
And I need you
But I can't have you
Even when you're here
