As if apart is melting
I miss upon the glass
No can (?)
Ruining the tasks
Going undetected
I suffer, bored my health be
No meddle no [?]
What you'll find, call it pulsing
And as if apart
Now as if apart
And as if apart
To have is not enough
To have is not enough
The fishes that are fed
Are sinking now
Ruining the tasks
Going undetected
Hoping for the past
To have is not enough
To have is not enough
To have is not enough
