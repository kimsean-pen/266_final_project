When Lenin was little
All the birds in the boat were singing, "Man this is it"
Now that he's older
All the sailors in heaven are singing up and shit

I know it can't be right
I know it can't be right
But I just smile instead
Of repeating what I say in my head

When Lenin was little
He stung like a vampire on all hollows eve
All the saints of heaven
Looking down at the leaves falling off the tree

I know it can't be right
I know it can't be right
But I just smile instead
Of repeating what I say

Daddy, daddy, please spare the world
From the government
Daddy, daddy, please spare my soul
From my judgment

Daddy, daddy, please send me a heart
That is made of cement
'Cause the money's all been spent

Daddy, daddy, please spare the world
From the government
Daddy, daddy, please spare my soul
From my judgment

Daddy, daddy, please send me a heart
That is made of cement
'Cause the money's all been spent
The money's all been spent
The money's all been spent
The money's all been spent
