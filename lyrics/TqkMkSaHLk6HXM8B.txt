Look into my melting eyes
Can't you see it melts for you?
The messages were mixed
And were polarized
I adore everything you do

A slice of lemon
The pride of heaven
So obvious to everyone but me
So ominous to everyone who could see
So why can't you see me?

Look into my watery eyes
With all the tears I shed for you
The disappointment of the future
And I'm mystified
Sounds like something I would do

Sitting on a place sipping on a drink
Flying over Greenland now I think
I used ti be so proud how much I got around
But now I see it differently
I look into your eyes
And I see what you see:

A slice of lemon
The pride of heaven

So obvious to everyone but me
So ominous to everyone but me
So why can't I see me?
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes
