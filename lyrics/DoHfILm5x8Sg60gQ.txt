I used to date and never fall in love
Just lookin' for an experience
Spending my time wasting it foolishly
Exploring my possibilities

But then one day I ran into you
You gave me feelings I never knew
I'd like to spend my weekends with you
And weekdays too
Wouldn't that be cool
I think I'm fallin' in love with you

So I'll be spendin' my time with you
There's nothing I'd rather do
I never had a lover like you
That makes me feel like the way that you do

You said you wanted to be serious
So speak to me cause I'm curious
To know exactly how you feel inside
And feel your sweet body touchin' mine

Cause there's so many things we can do
You give me feelings I never knew
I'd like to spend my weekends with you
And weekdays too
Wouldn't that be cool
I'm fallin', fallin', falling in love with you

So I'll be spendin' my time with you
There's nothin' I'd rather do
I never had a lover like you
That makes me feel like the way that you do

You gave me love
And baby, there's nothing better
Than the love you've given to me
Let me show you how much
I really care for you
Day and night
I'll treat you right
That's all I want to do

So I'll be spendin' my time with you
There's nothing I'd rather do
I never had a lover like you
Never had a lover like you
That makes me feel like the way that you do

Feel the way you do
So I'll be spending (All of my time with you)
I'm gonna be and I wanna be and I'm gonna, gonna

And I'm gonna be, yeah
Each and every day, yeah
In each and every way, yeah
All my time with you, I wanna be and I'm gonna be, gonna be

Every day with you, and Summers too
You're so fine, you're blowin' my mind
(Spendin', spendin') Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, yeah, Woah
Spendin', spendin'
I'm gonna be spendin', I wanna be spendin' (My time, my time baby)
Woah, my time...
