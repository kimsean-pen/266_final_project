Well, I was born on a Sunday
On Thursday, I had me a job
I was born on a Sunday
By Thursday, I was workin' out on the job
I ain't never had no day off
Since I learned right from wrong

Said, I was bad
I did somethin' to her head
Mama said I was bad
I did something to her head
And Papa threw me out
Oh, said I gotta earn my own way

I ain't never been in trouble
I ain't got the time
I don't mess around with magic, child
What I got is mine

Whatever you say, Lord
Well, that's what I'm gonna do
Whatever you say
Well, that's what I'm gonna do
'Cause I'm the workin' man
Lord, I do the job for you

I ain't never been in trouble
I ain't got the time
I don't mess around with magic, child
What I got is mine

Every Friday
Well, that's when I get paid
Don't take me on Friday, Lord
'Cause that's when I get paid
Let me die on Saturday night
Oh, before Sunday gets my head
