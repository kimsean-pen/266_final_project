I don't even understand
How I can find someone again
People say just start as friends
But it ain't easy to pretend, oh

I'm living cigarettes on cigarettes
Some nights that I, I just forget
Those silhouettes of my regrets and my pride
I'm wanting chemistry on chemistry
That fucking vibe I can't believe
Think you could be that remedy I can't find

You'll be the right to all my wrongs
I'll be the one to keep you strong
Even when all the love gets drawn
I'll bleed you still
You'll be the oxygen I breathe
Under the covers if you need
Even if all your loving leaves
I'll bleed you still, I will

You turn my weaknesses, my sins
Into fictions, into myths
Got me saying all this shit
Shit I thought I never meant, ooh

'Cause I love those cigarettes on cigarettes
Those nights that I just forget
Those silhouettes of my regrets and my pride
I'm wanting chemistry on chemistry
That fucking vibe I can't believe
Think you could be that remedy I can't find

You'll be the right to all my wrongs
I'll be the one to keep you strong
Even when all the love gets drawn
I'll bleed you still
You'll be the oxygen I breathe
Under the covers if you need
Even if all your loving leaves
I'll bleed you still, I will

I'll bleed, I'll bleed you still
I'll bleed, I'll bleed you (Ooh)
I'll bleed, I'll bleed you still
I'll bleed, I'll bleed you (Oh, no no)
I'll bleed, I'll bleed you still
I'll bleed, I'll bleed you
