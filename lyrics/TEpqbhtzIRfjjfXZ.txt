Break of dawn, you're still sleeping
I'm awake and I gotta go
Promises, I never keep 'em
They're just words that you should have known
Gotta go now, leave you there alone on a stormy Monday

I don't want to be yours
There's too much poison in your blood
Let it flow as it goes
Anyway you'll find another stud
The very next day you got one again on a stormy Monday

Wash your soul on a stormy Monday
Keep your dreams deep inside
Watch your step on a stormy Monday
Take me through this endless ride
Don't get drunk on a stormy Monday
You'll find a stranger in your bed
Being alone on a stormy Monday
It's even worse than being dead
