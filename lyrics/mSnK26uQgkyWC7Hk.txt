Take down this ragged nest
You have built on unsteady ground
Bury what is left so safely
When no one is around

Years past sleeping in winter's place
Waiting deep underground
Rainfalls and so dry again
Is this the end

Keep from moving
You're paralyzed from trying to recover
From that horrible breath of chemicals

You are losing
Bullets from withing your mind
And breaking walls of cannibals
Looking to empower you, devour you

Hold brace here it comes
Like a wind from inside spinning around
Let go as you turn you will learn
How to live softly alone

Roses on a lover's dress
Will soothe you from within
Diving away following birds of prey
Like an old friend you are losing again

Gentle are days covering warm at dusk
The moon sings to stars that he lost
Look how awkwardly strange we are
In our plain ways

Keep from moving
You're paralyzed from trying to recover
From that horrible breath of chemicals

You are losing
Bullets from withing your mind
And breaking walls of cannibals
Looking to empower you, devour you

Take your time coming home
Such a clear night summer feels right

Hold break here it comes
Like a wind from inside spinning around
Let go as you turn you will learn
How to live softly alone

Each day passes by like a cloud in the sky
You can't be found

Moses has forgiven you
For quietly living alone

Take your time coming home
Such a clear night summer feels right
I let it all break so I can see straight

I'm on the thin line
It's going to be the last time
Affection where I can't be
I wish the light would take me

Can I ask you why you gave in
Did it feel like you were caged in
I loved you till you ran out
Now it's time to fade out
