You take the time to find a way
And through it seems so clear
A silent wonder still remains
Is there more for me to learn?
Massive universe, save me once again

All the answers only led us to the edge
A final light never came and never will
So we fall and rise and walk again
The matter still prevails
The final light is the path and not the end
It's not the end

I take my time to understand
The matter in my hands
On an ordinary day
Mystery veiled by the dawn
Presents itself again
A never fading flame

All the answers only led us to the edge
A final light never came and never will
So we fall and rise and walk again
The matter still prevails
The final light is the path and not the end
It's not the end
All the answers only led us to the edge
A final light never came and never will
So we fall and rise and crawl again
The question still remains
The final light is the path and not the end
All the answers threw us back from where we came
This final light is the path and not the end
It's not the end
