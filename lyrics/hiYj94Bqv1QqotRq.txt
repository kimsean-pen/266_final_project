Sitting on a bear skin rug
Listening to grandpa talk
The whistle of a number called
The photo of a long lost dog

Do you love me, which one is it
We should be living in a warehouse district
I took a day in the lesson it told me
Passing off planes with anybody is easy
Darling, you know it shouldn't be like that
But I'll go with you to the laundromat

I found it in the drawer
In the drawer, I found it in a drawer
Took a little time but now I found it in a drawer
I cant go on but I'll go on
Left me with no time again
In the drawer, hidden in a drawer
Found it in the bottom, found it in a drawer
I cant go on but I'll go on
Found it in the drawer

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

The creaking under my wall
Familiar like an old time song
A memory when you were young
Remember in a time long gone
Do you love me, baby, do you love me?
Do you love me, baby, do you love me?

I found it the drawer
In the drawer, I found it in a drawer
Took a little time but now i found it in a drawer
I can't go on the but I'll go on
Left me with no time again
In the drawer, hidden in a drawer
Found it in the bottom, found it in a drawer
I can't go on but I'll go on
(do you love me)
I found it in the drawer
In the drawer, I found it in a drawer
(do you love me)
You had to go but now I found it in the drawer
I can't go on but I'll go on
