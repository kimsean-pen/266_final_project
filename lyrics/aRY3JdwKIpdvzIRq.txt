In the morning it comes
Heaven sent a hurricane
Not a trace of the sun
But I don't even run from rain

Beating out of my chest
Heart is holding on to you
From the moment I knew
From the moment I knew

You were the air in my breath
Filling up my love soaked lungs
Such a beautiful mess
Intertwined and overrun

Nothing better than this
Ooh, and then the storm can come
You feel just like the sun
Just like the sun

And hear you say, "We'll be alright"
I'm gonna trust you, babe
I'm gonna look in your eyes
And hear you say, "We'll be alright"
I'll follow you into the light

Never mind what I knew
Nothing seems to matter now
Ooh, who I was without you
I can do without

No one knows where it ends
How it may come tumbling down
But I'm here with you now
I'm with you now

And hear you say, "We'll be alright"
I'm gonna trust you, babe
I'm gonna look in your eyes
And hear you say, "We'll be alright"
I'll follow you into the light

Let the world come rushing
Come down hard, come crushing
All I need is right here beside me
And all the love I'm swearing
Take my love and wear it
Over your shoulders
And if you say, "We'll be alright"
I'm gonna trust you, babe
I'm gonna look in your eyes
And here you say, "We'll be alright"
I'll follow you into the light
