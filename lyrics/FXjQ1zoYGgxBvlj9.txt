And it's all the pain that men hold
Looking for her, shouldn't speak
Just like ending my home
Smiling face like having
Trace lights becoming a burning
Trace lights they got home
Trace lights that make you make a home again
Trace lights bring back hair

Yes, I feel everything
I'm so green, I'm so green
Yes, I feel everything you say
Yes, I feel as you say
Trace lights, they're just going short all the time
Take back beginning, sense to grey
I'm so green, yes, I'm so green
I'm so green, I'm so green
I feel everything
I feel everything you say
I feel everything you hear
I feel everything you hear
I'm gonna get them

I feel everything
I feel everything
I feel everything
Live the place with the gold
Live in a place with the gold
Live in a place with the gold
Live in a place with the gold
I feel the end
I feel the end
With the place, it's there you go
With the place, it's the end

Remember, step for the sound
I feel heaven, step for the sound
I feel heaven's stay for the sound
I feel heaven's splendour gleans the step
I feel heaven's splendour gleans the step
I feel heaven's splendour gleans the step
I feel heaven's splendour gleans the step
