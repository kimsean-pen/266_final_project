staring through the shade of a dark window
i didn't know where i'd end up
and i was watching you go
i saw the writing through the crack of the squad car door
it said what you think they're taking you for

we walk too close to the radar
we got the most to lose and they know
that we walk too close

but you and me, we got a cool generator
so you and me, we walk too close to the radar
staring on out it's a cool sunny day tho through the car window
they're driving you home.

in the eyes of every cop - don't it seem to say
it's criminal
it's written in the code of your DNA
but the pillage and the take, it don't ever stop
cuz that's the way they generate oh

we walk too close to the radar
we got the most to lose and they know
that we walk too close

but you and me, we got a cool generator
so you and me, we walk too close to the radar
staring on out, it's a cool sunny day though
you and me, we got a cool generator
you and me, we got a cool generator
staring out the window
they're driving you home
