Oh beautiful, for heroes proved
In liberating strife
Who more than self, our country loved
And mercy more than life

America, America, may God thy gold refine
Till all success be nobleness
And every gain devined

And you know when I was in school
We used to sing it something like this, listen here

Oh beautiful, for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain

But now wait a minute, I'm talking about
America, sweet America
You know, God done shed his grace on thee
He crowned thy good, yes he did, in a brotherhood
From sea to shining sea

You know, I wish I had somebody to help me sing this
(America, America) America, I love you America
You see, my God he done shed his grace on thee (God shed his grace on thee)
And you oughta love him for it
Cause he, he, he, he, crowned thy good
He told me he would, with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea (From sea to shining sea)
Oh Lord, oh Lord, I thank you Lord
(Shining sea)
