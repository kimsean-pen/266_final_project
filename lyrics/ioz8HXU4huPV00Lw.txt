The memory of you
Still in our zone
And our song is playing in my head on and on
Our world is black and white baby now that you're gone

I'm smelling your perfume on the peeling extra mind
And I remember how you loved me every single night
And the warm is up tight
I'm falling asleep on that dream that you're mine

And I dream that you're mine...

I'm a lo-o-only heart
I'm a lo-o-only heart
I'm a lo-o-only heart
I'm a lo-o-only heart

The memory of you
Still in our zone
And our song is playing in my head on and on
The world is black and white baby now that you're gone
I stare and I think that forever is gone

I'm a lonely heart, lonely heart
You're my lonely heart

I'm a lo-o-only heart
I'm a lo-o-only heart
I'm a lo-o-only heart
I'm a lo-o-only heart
