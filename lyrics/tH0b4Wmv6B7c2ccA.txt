Just another song, just another tale
Of a broken heart
Don't wanna see you hurt,
there's something you should learn
From the stars

My friend you ought to know
I'm afraid it's time to know

Whoever said love was easy?
Do you know they told you wrong?
'Cause every time you feel it yea
A piece of you is gone
Is it something that you want?
Something that you need?
'Cause honey you should know
Whoever said love was easy?
Do you know they told you wrong?

Write it on the wall, tell it to them all
I'm happy now
Now you're standing tall
Don't wanna see you fall
Down to the ground

My friend you ought to know
I'm afraid it's time to know

Whoever said love was easy?
Do you know they told you wrong?
'Cause every time you feel it yea
A piece of you is gone
Is it something that you want?
Something that you need?
'Cause honey you should know
Whoever said love was easy?
Do you know they told you wrong?

I know the feeling, is sweeter than ever
But I won't regret
I'd rather tell you, now or never
What to expect

Tears don't always dry
But tell em there's no lie
'Cause at the end

Whoever said love was easy?
Do you know they told you wrong?
'Cause every time you feel it yea
A piece of you is gone
Something that you want? Need?
'Cause honey you should know
Whoever said love was easy?
Do you know they told you wrong?
