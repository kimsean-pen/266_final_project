1995 is missing buses
It's walking 15 miles to see your love
It's knowing you're alive through all the fuzz
It's never coming down from going up

1995 is cutting classes
It's sitting over coffees talking indie treats
It's the mere sensation of being the first one that you see
When morning opens up the skies
You see me when daylight opens up your eyes

And though I'm happier now I always long somehow
Back to 1995

All my friends have different plans to make their lives worth
while
Some for the better
Some for worse
Some have gone to different cities searching every mile
For missing pieces that will make a whole

1995 seems like a long way to go
If you ever were to find your way back home
But the only thing I really miss is being the first one that
you see
When morning opens up the skies
You see me when daylight opens up your eyes
