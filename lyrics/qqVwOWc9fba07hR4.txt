Shirt was in the car when it happened
Swear to god we're cursed with all this sadness
I'm dizzy in the thought
Memory loss

Your chrysalis
Nighttime wanderer
Venom drip
King of somber

Fumble on a road, blackened backyard
Weapon from a trunk, static recall
I'm dizzy in the thought
Memory loss

Your chrysalis
Nighttime wanderer
Venom drip
King of somber
Slow like my fist
Underwater
Blended light
Sharpener
