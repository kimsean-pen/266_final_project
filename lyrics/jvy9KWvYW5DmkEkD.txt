I think I'm having a meltdown

I feel the tension, feel the tension
Confessions told, tell me, tell me everything
Insanity is taking over
The fantasies are driving me mad

Before, never let go
Before I fold
Before, never let go
Before I fold

You know that I am heading for a meltdown
Controlling me losing it all
You know that I am heading for a meltdown
Just take away the tears
I'm suffocating, don't leave me here waiting

The cry within, cry within
The flesh is bold, tell me, tell me everything
Calamity is waiting silent
The razor is cutting the pain and letting it out

Before, never let go
Before I fold
Before, never let go
Before I fold

You know that I am heading for a meltdown
Controlling me losing it all
You know that I am heading for a meltdown
Just take away the tears
I'm suffocating, don't leave me here waiting

Over and over in my head
I see your scars
Remember the day when we first met
Take me back

Before, never let go
Before I fold
Before, never let go
Before I fold

You know that I am heading for a meltdown
Controlling me losing it all
You know that I am heading for a meltdown
Just take away the tears
I'm suffocating, don't leave me here waiting

Meltdown
For a meltdown, meltdown
