We've all been searching for somethin'
Somethin' that's bigger than us to believe in

Who knew a star was so close it could touch us?
Light up our hearts, lead the way through the dark

I've waited all my life to feel this feelin'
That I feel right now
Open up your eyes and see the world is
Brighter now

Can you see?
Tell me, can you see the star?
Shine for you and me
It lights the way from where we are
Tell me can you see?
The son of God, the great I Am
Meet the King of Kings, come and follow me
Tell me can you see the star?

A leap of faith on a promise
There is no army, no mountain can stop us

Who knew a star was so close it could touch us?
Light up our hearts, lead the way through the dark

Can you see? (can you see?)
Tell me, can you see the star? (star)
Shine for you and me (you and me)
It lights the way from where we are (oh)
Tell me can you see? (can you see?)
The son of God, the great I Am (great I Am)
Meet the King of Kings, come and follow me
Tell me can you see the star?

I've waited all my life to feel this feelin'
That I feel right now
Open up your eyes and see the world is
Brighter now

Can you see? (can you see?)
Tell me, can you see the star?
Shine for you and me (you and me)
It lights the way from where we are
Tell me, can you see? (can you see?)
The son of God, the great I Am (great I Am)
Meet the King of Kings, come and follow me (oh)
Tell me, can you see the star? (star)

Can you see it? See it?
Tell me, can you see the star? (tell me, can you see the star?)
Can you see it? See it?
Tell me, can you see the star? (see the star)
Can you see it? See it? (king of Kings, Lord of Lords)
Tell me, can you see the star? (oh)
Can you see it? See it?
Oh, tell me, can you see the star?
Meet the King of Kings, come and follow me
