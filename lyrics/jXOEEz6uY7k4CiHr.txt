I wanna leave this sinking ship
I've tried my best
I just can't quit
It feels like dying all the time
I've lost my faith
I've lost my mind

Cause I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait here
Cause I don't wanna wait
My whole life
Watch you drowning

It's so amazing to behold
It's all I want to have and hold
It feels like gouging out my eyes
Illuminate and open wide

Cause I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait here
Cause I don't wanna wait
My whole life

Cause I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait here
I don't wanna wait
My whole life
Watch you drowning

Watch you drowning
Watch you drowning

Cause I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait here
Cause I don't wanna wait
My whole life
Cause I don't wanna wait
Cause I don't wanna wait here
Cause I don't wanna wait
My whole life
Watch you drowning
Watch you drown
