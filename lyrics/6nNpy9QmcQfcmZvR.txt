Mountain of pearls to sooth the soul
Gold and silver and silk to cover the old
Clocks and rubies crushing these hard bones
I'm going blind from to many shiny stones

Fortune cast a curse, I knew it would
Fortune bury you, I knew It would

Sleep on ugly dreaming wave
Vivid life turn into gray
No friends wanna stay around
So moving on to a different part of town

Fortune cast a curse, I knew it would
Fortune bury you, I knew it would
