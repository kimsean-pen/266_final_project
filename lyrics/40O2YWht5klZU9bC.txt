Talk to yourself
Please make your mind up
Is there anything left
At all?

Everything and all at once
In my mind
Leave you two times
So dark, my eyes

Never leave the light on
Please make your mind up
Hear you when I do what's wrong
Well, we try

Everything and all at once
In my mind
Leave you two times
So dark, my eyes

Cloistered from yourself
You never even try
Your best, just lie down
You close your eyes no more
Before your will just goes

Surrounded by the wrong
A mounting wave of sound
The glimmer breaks me down
The ground beneath me, gone
The sky might open up

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
