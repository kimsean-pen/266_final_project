Now here I go, hope I don't break down
I won't take anything, I don't need anything
Don't want to exist, I can't persist
Please stop before I do it again

Just talk about nothing, let's talk about nothing
Let's talk about no one, please talk about no one, someone, anyone

You and me have a disease
You affect me, you infect me
I'm affected, you're addicted
You and me, you and me

I'm on the edge, get against the wall
I'm so distracted, I love to strike you
Here's my confession, you learned your lesson
Stop me before I do it again

Just talk about nothing, let's talk about nothing
Let's talk about no one, please talk about no one, someone, anyone

You and me have a disease
You affect me, you infect me
I'm affected, you're addicted
You and me, you and me

You're clear, as a heavy lead curtain wanna drill you
Like an ocean we can work it out
I've been running out, now I'm running out
Don't be mad about it baby

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I want to tie you, crucify you
Kneel before you, revile your body
You and me, we're made in heaven
I want to take you, I want to break you
Supplicate you, you thought you know that
You and me are a miracle
I want to bathe you in holy water
I want to kill you upon the alter
You and me, you and me
