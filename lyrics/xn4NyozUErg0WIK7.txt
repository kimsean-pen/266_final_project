Within striking distance from Ground Zero sits a smoldering international cauldron, the United "Abominations" as it were. Born to prevent wars, as if war was in the face of disaster, and stood silent while terrorization took hostage the world.

In a mire of hypocrisy, ignores sex crimes by its blue helmets, and enables terrorism, so in the end, it has failed. And the UN is where our so-called friends get to stab us in the back, and we pay 22% of their tab to host our enemies here at home.

Ambassadors from countries otherwise known as "The Catastrophe" enjoy Diplomatic immunity, living in Manhattan, while their children are turned into prostitutes. It's a complete and utter disgrace! A blot on the face of humanity! And they get away with it!?!

Poverty in their kitchens
Held hostage by oil-for-food
Yet their own plates are full off the fat of their lands
There's no blood on their hands, right Gojo?
They promised to tell the truth
Without leaving a fingerprint.
They will lose the UN one way or another.
The victim, I fear will be us, sisters and brothers!

The UN is right; you can't be any more "un"
than you are right now, the UN is undone.
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun.
The threat is real, the Locust King has come.
Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done.
It's payback time, at the United Abominations.

A grave and gathering danger
the decision to attack
based on secret intelligence, it'll take years
I fear to undo the failings in Iraq.
You may bury the bodies
but you can't bury the crimes.
Only fools stand up and really lay down their arms
No, not me, not when Death lasts forever

The UN is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now, the UN is undone.
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun.
The threat is real, the Locust King has come.
Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done.
It's payback time.

NATO invaded Yugoslavia to end ethnic cleansing, there was no UN.
The US invaded Afghanistan after 9/11, there was no UN.
Saddam Hussein violated 17 UN resolutions; The UN was asked to join the war in Iraq. The US invaded, there was no UN.
Libya bombed a discotheque in Berlin killing Americans, there was no UN.
Iran funds a mosque, and attacked the US in the seventies, there was no UN.
Facing war, without end, looking into the future.
There... was... no... more... UN!
