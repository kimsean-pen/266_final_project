I called you up to say goodnight
I thought that things would be alright
But I guess I was dead wrong
And I just want to stay asleep
Because thoughts of you are all I dream
But when I wake up you're gone

For weeks the days I spent felt like forever
I couldn't get you off my mind
I wondered how you got inside my head
And made me think that you were mine
I thought you meant it when you said forever
I guess that was a lie
I still get choked up when I think of you
It happens all the time

Well there's a place that we used to go
I pass by now and feel alone
And wonder if you ever stop here like I do
And someone told me that they saw you there one night
Skipping rocks down by the water
All alone, tears in your eyes

For weeks the days I spent felt like forever
I couldn't get you off my mind
I wondered how you got inside my head
And made me think that you were mine
I thought you meant it when you said forever
I guess that was a lie
I still get choked up when I think of you
It happens all the time

Your time's all gone
It's all been spent
Who's left by your side
Not me anymore
