Where are they now?,
they are gone,
I saw them run,
run to the sea,
under the waves,
all has been said,
can you hear them?
Their voices are free,
free from the sun stare,
free from the noise,
of lost souls...

In exiled sound,
washed in with the tide,
their voices are free,
free from the sun stare,
free from the noise,
of lost souls...

Their voice carrys life,
under the waves,
under the waves,
Their voice carrys life,
under the waves,
under the waves,
under the waves,
under the waves...
