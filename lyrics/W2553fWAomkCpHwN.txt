I'm finding my way back to sanity
Again
Though I don't really know what I'm gonna do
When I get there

I take a breath and hold on tight
Spin around one more time
And gracefully fall back to the arms of grace
'Cause I am hanging on every word you're saying
Even if you don't want to speak tonight

That's alright, alright with me
'Cause I want nothing more than
To sit outside heaven's door
And listen to you breathing

It's where I want to be
Where I want to be
I'm looking past the shadows in my mind
Into the truth and I'm trying to identify

The voices in my head
God, which one's you?
Let me feel one more time
What it feels like to feel alone

Break these calluses off of me one more time
'Cause I am hanging on every word you're saying
Even if you don't want to speak tonight
That's alright, alright with me

'Cause I want nothing more than to sit outside your door
And listen to you breathing
It's where I want to be, yeah
I don't want nothing from you

But you're tired of me waiting for the
Scraps to fall off of your table to the ground
La la la da da la la la
'Cause I just want to be here now
'Cause I am hanging on every word you're saying
Even if you don't want to speak tonight
That's alright, alright with me
'Cause I want nothing more than to sit outside heaven's door
And listen to you breathing
It's where I want to be
'Cause I am hanging on every word you're saying
Even if you don't want to speak tonight
That's alright, alright with me
'Cause I want nothing more than to sit outside heaven's door
And listen to you breathing
It's where I want to be, yeah
Where I want to be
Where I want to be
