there is no self to kill
a city of gardens

I'm going to kill my self
to kill my self
to kill my self
I'm going to kill my self
so there won't be nothing left

I'm going to remove myself
remove myself
remove myself
I'm going to remove myself
so there won't be nothing left

Because you are everyone you hate
when you're asleep or awake
all the choices you've made

you are everyone you hate
and it is ruining your life
