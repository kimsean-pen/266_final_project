And your birthday goes by,
While you're counting recycled nights,
In a head that chewed small,
Don't the weekends float by.
Shape me please, I'll be Plasticine,
I'll be all that I can be,
I could use the change.

In the morning I count the times I've taken new oaths,
In the morning I've peace of mind, raise your hopes, come on

All your lovers still use,
Try a wealth of what feels new,
Come, she says, leave and rest my head,
Stay, and I'll be someone else,
I could use the change.

In the morning I count the times I've taken new oaths,
In the morning I've peace of mind, raise your hopes, come on

Say it's all in fashion with the cover bigger pattern but we're never quite as happy as we think we all deserve,
In the morning I read my lines, count those you love as if they're all you're ever gonna need

Say it's all in fashion with a cover bigger pattern but we're never quite as happy as we think we all deserve,
In the morning I've peace of mind, humour me, come on

I'd count my blessings if I thought they're all that I would need,
I'd count my blessings if I thought they're all that I would need.
