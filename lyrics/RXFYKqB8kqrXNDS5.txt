First boyfriend
You live in my house and we share a toilet seat
And I am not the least bit drawn
Covers in divisive use
Scared of how little I care
First boyfriend
You live in my house and we share a toilet seat
And I am not the least bit drawn
And I am not the least bit drawn to your heat
Nights you roll over and introduce yourself
Nurse this erection back to full health
On the nights you roll over and introduce yourself
I am elsewhere
Failed your Maiden Voyage
Fail the Maiden Voyage
Failed your Maiden Voyage
Fail the Maiden Voyage
Faded all the while
You know that this was never your home, your life, your husband, your time.
Failed your Maiden Voyage
Fail the Maiden Voyage
Failed your Maiden Voyage (Uh oh failed your Maiden)
Fail the Maiden Voyage
Faded all the while
You failed your maiden
You know, No love remains nobody (???)
You don't do anything with your life.
Fascinating, terrible, you stupid idling mind
I can prod your hurt all night
Or resign and find any other stupid thing to do with my time
I was never poetic and never kind
Scared of how little I care for you
I am elsewhere
On the nights you roll over and introduce yourself
Nurse this erection back to full health
On the nights you roll over and introduce yourself
I am elsewhere

Faded all the while!
You know that this was never your home, your life, your husband, your time.
Failed your Maiden Voyage
Fail the Maiden Voyage
Failed your Maiden Voyage (Uh Oh failed your Maiden)

Faded all the while!
