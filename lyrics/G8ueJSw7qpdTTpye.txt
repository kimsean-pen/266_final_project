Once upon a time somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can
I got to go
I got to go
Once upon a time we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves of my heart

Once upon a time we burned bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on
And on, and on, and on

Once upon a time on the same side...
Once upon a time on the same side, in the same game
Now why'd you have to go?
Have to go and throw water on my flame

I could have been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
I could have been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
You stole my star
You stole my star

'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
Oh-oh, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
Oh-oh, you really hurt me
