I need you
No, d'ont tell me say it's not so
I won't look to that side
When I know that you're no longer mine
The daylight already decided
Somehow reminded of you
The tear on my eyelid
The tear I was hiding
I miss you ohhh
Missing without information
Listening to nothing
People have changed in the station
The streets marked already divided
Somehow reminded of you
Driverless passenger
Lashes reception breaks through
Scared cause I know i'm alive
Long gone
Lost in the shiver I cry
Is that you?
Is that you there?
Reflection in one i'm so scared
Is that you?
Is that you there?
Reflection in one im so scared
