Listen to me, I can't wait to see you
I can't wait to be you, I can't wait
Depends on me, I can't wait to be you
I can't wait to see you, I can't wait
Waiting's what we do
Not enough to give enough to you
Wish there was a place where it made sense
A place where we could rest and [Incomprehensible]
Depends on me, I can't wait to be you
I can't wait to feel you, I can't wait
Listen to me, I can't wait to see you
I can't wait to be you, I can't wait
Why should it take so long?
Something that's so real to come along
I feel the pull but I can't pay the price
I don't make it right [Incomprehensible]
What's left to be? I can't wait, my darling
In no state, I'm longing, I can't wait
Listen to me, is it right to be here?
I can't find [Incomprehensible]
Pain is what we do
Got enough to make some more for you
I can't take so much before I break
Knowing what's at stake, it's all I do
Listen to me
(Listen to me)
