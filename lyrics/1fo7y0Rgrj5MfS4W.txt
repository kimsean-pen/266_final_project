Long gone is the guilt
For Narcisses' selfie sticks
Have replaced the hand of a fellow
And the louder we speak
The louder it resonates
Empty rooms only send back but never listen
Your own smell's a blessing
Until a tongue capitulates on your stink, stink, stink
May the sound of someone else's voice
Break your walls

And wait for it
It always comes
And you always go
With the curse of the savior
Wasting his faultless hands cleaning a mirror

Long gone is the guilt
And long due is the empathy
Clean your fucking mirror
May you hear someone else's voice

The fire we breathe
It burns the confidence
But the flames that we spit
They lick the ego and it shines for us
And louder you speak, more flames you spit, lonelier you get
How precious reflection
Carry on practice perfect smiles
Shining bright with your teeth on fire
How precious reflection
And you wish you were someone else
You know how you wish you were someone else
How precious reflection
And i wish i was someone else than you
Yeah i wish i was someone else
Cause nothing seems to change in here
I torche my own breath
My name is all that is left of me

Burn and let them all see you
In your face of comfort
(Burn)
How to know you're falling
Without a floor, walls or ceiling?
It's a comedy that chases no end

All the time we waste
Upgrading mirrors
