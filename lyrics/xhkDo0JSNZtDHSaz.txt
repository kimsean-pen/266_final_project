captain the horseman and hound south travelin slowly
my loyality to crossroads and thresholds
comes with my rising hope to leave this hunt unfollowed
My blood's courage courses to rendezvous
with freedomi swore nothing in my passing(in my passing)
to die like surrender would teach me a lesson
"Judas", they too would cry
oh oriole in the mile before dawn
do not return a treasonous song unguarded
