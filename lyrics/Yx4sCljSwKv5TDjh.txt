Yeah
Listen to metal
You let your hair
Whip 'round in circles

I have something simple
To make you feel good

Dead
I found a purpose
I got something to teach you

I got a skull
Sits on the mantle
Crawl up from Hell
Talk to the devil

It's something simple
To make you feel good

Dead
I've got another
I got something to show you

And I don't care it's summertime
Shred the grip from my guitar
Bleed the riff from my lungs

Take a shot
Forget the chaser
Let's turn it out
Until we're wasted

It's more than simple
To make you feel good

Damn
Blow the speakers
I got somewhere to take you

And I don't care it's summertime
Shred the grip from my guitar
Bleed the riff from my lungs

Demons
Dear god
Make you want to turn your cross
The pain subsides
Pain of black and burning hot
Demons
Our god
You held your hand so high
I want to show you something

I want to
Feel so heavy
I feel heavy
I feel heavy
I feel heavy
I feel heavy
I feel heavy
And I don't want to be, girl
Something more
We don't wanna be, girl
Something more
We don't wanna be your

And I don't care it's summertime
Shred the grip from my guitar
Bleed the riff from my lungs
