Notice me, take my hand.
Why are we strangers when
our love is strong
why carry on without me

Our love was strong
Why carry on without me?

Chorus:
Everytime I try to fly I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear

What have I done?
You seem to move on easy...

Chorus:
And everytime I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I may have made it rain, babe
Please forgive me
But my weakness caused you pain
And this songs my sorry

oohh

At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away

Chorus:
And everytime I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you baby

And everytime I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you baby
