I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
but that's not unusual
it's just that the moon is full
and you decided to come

And here I sit, hand on the telephone
hearing the voice I'd known
a couple of light years ago
heading straight for a fall

But we both know what memories can bring
they bring Diamonds And Rust
yes we both know what memories can bring
they bring Diamonds And Rust

Now I see you standing all around and snow in your hair
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over washington square
and then comes that white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me

we both could've died then and there
Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
then give me another word for it
you were so good with words

and at keeping things paid
cause I need some of that vagueness now, it's all come back too clearly
yes, I love you dearly
and if you're offering me Diamonds And Rust

I've already paid
But we both know what memories can bring
they bring Diamonds And Rust
yes we both know what memories can bring
they bring Diamonds And Rust
Diamonds, Diamonds And Rust
Diamonds, Diamonds And Rust
Diamonds, Diamonds And Rust
Diamonds, Diamonds And Rust
