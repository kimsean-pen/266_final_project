I was in Hollywood
At the Witch House
With the Reptiles
And the Catholics

You was in Hollywood
At the Witch House
With the Reptiles
And the Catholics

And I'll make you lap it up.
You got that nothing-something violence
I could never know but
You got my vengeance coming

I was in Hollywood
At the Witch House
With the Reptiles
And the Catholics

You was in Hollywood
At the Witch House
With the Reptiles
And the Catholics

Have mercy
Give me symmetry
Give me happiness
Give me sanity
Have mercy
Give me symmetry
Give me happiness
Give me CLARITY

And I'll make you lap it up.
You got that nothing-something violence
I could never know but
You got my vengeance coming

And I'll make you lap it up.
You got that nothing-something violence
I could never know but
You got my vengeance coming
I got that something-something
Judas you could never know but
You got my vengeance coming...
