You had plenty money 1922
You let other women make a fool of you
Why don't you do right like some other men do?
Get out of here and get me some money too

You're sitting down, wondering what it's all about
If you ain't got no money, they will put you out
Why don't you do right like some other men do?
Get out of here and get me some money too

If you had prepared twenty years ago
You wouldn't be wanderin' now from door to door
Why don't you do right, like some other men do?
Get out of here and get me some money too

I fell for your jivin' and I took you in
Now all you got to offer me's a drink of gin
Why don't you do right like some other men do?
Get out of here and get me some money too

Why don't you do right, like some other men do?
Like some other men do
