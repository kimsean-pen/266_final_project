You were big city living; girlfriend like Eva Mendes
Until your side chick called you up, said when she might be back in
Now you're alone and crying; inside, you're slowly dying
Cause Magic Mike just got your key

That's how you know you messed up
That's how you know you messed up
That's how you know you messed up
That's how you know you messed up

You were the man in college; got a degree in awesome
And had more zeroes in your bank than all the Matrix [?]
Now you're in your mama's basement, cause you spend every paycheck
The IRS your new best friend

That's how you know you messed up
That's how you know you messed up
That's how you know you messed up
That's how you know you messed up

Ha, oh
You had it going for you; moved out to California
Got lost in money, drugs, and women; now for all your dollars
Now Nico's unemployed and Vinz's love for coke destroyed him
So now we back in Norway

That's how we know we messed up
That's how we know we messed up (oh no!)
That's how we know we messed up (hey)
That's how we know we messed up
Fucked up, fucked up

Uh, yeah
Kid Ink
You used to be the big spender, grabbing the check every dinner
Showing out to your girlfriend's best friends just so they could wish they was with you (wait)
You ain't wanna hit the club, but the pressure got you out trying to get a table and a picture
Everybody Snapchat pictures, but ain't nobody trying to drive on the liquor, nah nah
I been getting so twisted, tie-dye, bye-bye
Think we should leave after I pay
But you forgot to save cash for the valet

That's how you know you messed up (that's how you know)
That's how you know you messed up
That's how you know you messed up (that's how you know)
That's how you know you messed up (that's how you know)
That's how you know you messed up
(That's how you know you messed up, you messed up)
That's how you know you messed up
(Yeah yeah yeah, that's how you know you messed up, you messed up)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
