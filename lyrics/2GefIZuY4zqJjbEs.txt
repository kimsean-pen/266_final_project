The suburbs they are dreaming
They're a twinkle in her eye
She's been feeling frisky
Since her husband said goodbye

She wears a low cut t-shirt
Runs a little B and B
She's most accommodating
When she's in her lingerie

Wife-swapping is your future
You know that it would suit ya

Yes they're stereotypes
There must be more to life
All your life you're dreaming
And then you, you stop dreaming
From time to time you know you should be
Going on another bender

The suburbs they are sleeping
But he's dressing up tonight
She likes a man in uniform
He likes to wear it tight

They're on the lovers' sofa
They're on the patio
And when the fun is over
Watch themselves on video

The neighbors may be staring
But they are just past caring

Yes the stereotypes
There must be more to life
All your life you're dreaming
And then you stop dreaming
From time to time you know you should be
Going on another bender
Yes there must be more to life than stereotypes

Wife-swapping is your future
You know that it would suit ya

Yes they're stereotypes
There must be more to life
All your life you're dreaming
And then you, you stop dreaming
From time to time you know you should be
Going on another bender
Yes, there must be more to life

They're stereotypes
All your life you're dreaming
And then you, you stop dreaming
From time to time you know you should be
Going on another bender
Before it all comes to an end
