Insanity and hope's diversion
We walked a long-long way without precaution
Once being judged we never lost the power
In one we all believe and trust, oh, my brother

Insanity and hope diversions
This town just needs to breed escaping further emotions
Once being lost we never found the answers
Now fight or run away real fast, oh, my brother

In one we all believe
And trust
Now fight or run away
Real fast
