So you and I, we've come to this place
And never did I believe that I'd survive
Now what ever happens know that I'm about honor...
...honor among thieves (amen)
So you and I, we talk a little
About the themes and all the thinking, then I die...
...a little
whatever happened about honoring thy father, mother...

...honor me.

Backtrack easy, everything's easy... tell me again?
'Is it us or them, us or them?'
Backtrack people, beware the vat people, prepare the cat people
Beware the bad people and I'm a bad man...

So you and I, we talk a little...
About the fate of all those days and then I DIE.
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO YOUR WORDS ABOUT HONOR?!?

...HONOR AMONG MEN!!!

Backtrack easy, everything's easy... tell me again?
'Is it us or them, us or them?'
Backtrack people, beware the vat people, prepare the cat people
Beware the bad people I'm a bad, bad man...

So you and I, we've come to this place
And never did I believe that I'd survive... this...
Now what ever happens know that I'm about honor...
...honor, honor, honor...

Backtrack people, everythings evil... tell me again?
'Is it us or them, us or them?'
Backtrack people, beware the vat people, prepare the cat people
Beware the bad people I'm a black cat man...
