You may be dumb but the passage of times can change anything like the feelings we find
so i'll disappear through the crack in the wall and the memories I leave will be nothing at all

it's kind of funny
Ooh ooooo ooh oooo oooh
it's kind of funny

So close to peace in the valley's so far i've lost all the fears that appeared in the dark
Oh we all are so weak, so frail it's unfair, through the crack on the wall it could be anywhere

it's kind of funny
Ooh ooooo ooh oooo oooh
it's kind of funny

(instrument)

it's kind of funny
Ooh ooooo ooh oooo oooh
it's kind of funny
