You have to become
What you fancy

Paperback head
You get carried away
Stitch up your spine
Keep the suitors away
You must draw your own aid
Must sift your affairs
Must frame up
A material girl

Wild fires
You must remit

Can't stand the smoke
Pull the sheets down low
Rope up your mind
Keep the suitors in line
Must draw your own aid
Must sift your affairs
Must frame up
A material girl

A material girl

I gasp like sugar and spice
I gasp like sugar and spice

Who better than you? Better than you
Who better than you? Better than you
Who better than you? Better than you
Who better than you?

A paperback head
You get carried away
Stitch up your spine
Keep the suitors away
Can't stand the smoke
Pull the sheets down low
Rope up your mind
Keep the suitors in line
You must draw your own aid
Must sift your affairs
Must frame up
A material girl

A material girl, a material girl
A material girl, a material girl
A material girl, a material girl
A material girl
