I still remember all the back and forth you couldn't stay away
and I couldn't take it, like a cold wind blows you're calling out my name
and now it haunts me, softly fading are the memories of your face
I should have listened when you whispered my name, still you couldn't say

cuz you couldn't say goodbye
now I cannot ask you why
although our time is through
no getting over you
things will never be the same
I can't even say your name
I know our time is through
no getting over you

I still remember as we walked the moon to stay out of the way
memories burning like a cigarettes, like the ashes call your name
lost in a moment when you packed your rags and said you couldn't stay
left on a message that I never read, you're calling out my name

cuz you couldn't say goodbye
now I cannot ask you why
although our time is through
no getting over you
I will never be the same
I can't even say your name
I know our time is through
no getting over you

you know my heart still pumps my blood, all the same
it's over, there's no starting over, I will live on
although your memories lives on, all the same
it's over, there's no starting over, no starting over

I still remember all the back and forth, you couldn't stay away
I couldn't take it, like a cold wind blows you're calling out my name

cuz you couldn't say goodbye
now I cannot ask you why
although our time is through
no getting over you
and I will never be the same
I can't even say your name
I know our time is through
no getting over you
no getting over you
memory lives on
getting over you
