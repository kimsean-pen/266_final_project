Romance in the dark with you
All at once I knew darlin', love was near
I thrill to my finger tips, I could feel your lips
Darlin', oh so near

The music was so entrancing
The lights all began to fade
I said to myself, keep dancing
But only my heart obeyed

A flame grew from just a spark
When I found romance in the dark with you

The music was so entrancing
The lights all began to fade
I said to myself, keep dancing
But only my heart obeyed

A flame grew from just a spark
When I found romance in the dark with you
