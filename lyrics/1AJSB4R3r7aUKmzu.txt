I heard the sound, the shout proclaimed
Now I'm here to praise poison
It's a Monday, let me be mundane
How's there so much to speculate?
I can't stand to carry the weight
Call me "the sound and the fury"
Consider me dead and buried
I'm like the city's grime
No time for no crime
Praise poison
They fill your head with the devil and god
You're so bored, but there's a choice
You're screaming without a voice
They fill your head with the devil and god
Call me "the sound and the fury"
Consider me dead and buried
I'm like the city's grime
No time for no crime
