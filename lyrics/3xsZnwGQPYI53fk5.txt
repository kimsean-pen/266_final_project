The time of your life
Life is dangerous
Calling your wife
Calling goodbye

Cuz nothing excites her
The time of your life
Life is dangerous

Taking your car
Driving your car

Cuz nothing excites her
Nothing good

Life is dangerous

I'm chasing all of the
The colour extreme

I'm changing all of their
Coming extreme
There's nothing I fear

Nothing excites her
Nothing good
