Did we ever know where we were going?
Every time I turn around, just another ghost
Misreading every feeling
You would think I had the worst intentions
It was all fun and games but you'll never know
In clear view I could hear you

On the phone
But why should you alone?
I was trying to find a reason why
I'd ever let it grow
(But she said)

Who knew we were lightning?
I saw a spark before we heard any sound to follow

I think it's time I let my eyes stay open
I'm missing out on the point if they're always closed
Switch focus, now I know

This is worth my time
So can you read my mind?
It says I'm tryna find a reason why
To leave it all behind

So I'm out on a limb now
(The path that we've been down)
I fight through but somehow
I hear you say

Who knew we were lightning?
I saw a spark before we heard any sound

If you look my way instead
We can make this permanent
Is there something waiting to be found?
Who knew we were?

Now it's all making sense
In time we would find it
I was caught in suspense
But with you I'm reminded
It's real now

Who knew we were lightning?
I saw a spark before we heard any sound to follow

Who knew we were lightning?
I saw a spark before we heard any sound
If you look my way instead
We can make this permanent
Is there something waiting to be found?
Is there something waiting to be found?
Who knew we were?
