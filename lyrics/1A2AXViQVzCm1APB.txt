Stop, let's take a moment
You are what you are, I'm no alarmist
One look, if you wanna see
There's a Rosebud for you and one for me

A cage holds you
We've all got one we call home
In the event of a 911
Who holds the key is what you need to know

Use those keys and take a drive
Through the back alleys of your mind, have mercy

Use those keys and take a drive
Through the back alleys of your mind, have mercy

A cage holds you
We've all got one we call home
In the event of a 911
Who holds the key is what you need to know

Let's face it
Admit that it's all related
Just try it with eyes closed, you'll make it
It'll hurt, I promise you
What is your Rosebud, you've got to know

The secret won't reach the coast
I see a man in the crowd with a rope
Death arms like a crooked T
No act of telepathy could reveal your Rosebud to me

Let's face it
Admit that it's all related
Don't mess this up now
You'll make it
It'll hurt, I promise you
What is your Rosebud, you've got to know

It'll hurt
It'll hurt
It'll hurt
It'll hurt, I promise you

It'll hurt
It'll hurt
It'll hurt, I promise you
