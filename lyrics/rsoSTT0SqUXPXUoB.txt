Jackie was a girl, was more than just a girl
She always had big dream
See the whole world fall in love
And do her heart believe
But mama said "baby girl be tough
Everything ain't what it seems"
I had to go through the things she wne t through
I know know what it means
Harmony drop that beat

I'm a bad mah'fucker
I'm a bad mah'fucker

Can't even hate cause you know this shit hot
Yeah I'm that bitch, like it or not
Better get ready cause I'm not gon' stop, stop, stop
Let that beat drop
A lot of these bitches they came and they went
I got a few things I'ma get off my chest
Please don't act like you ain't heard what I said, heard what I said
You heard what I said

I'ma B.M.F
Shawty put my initials on it, on it
I'ma B.M.F
I'ma put you all up on it, on it

Imagine delivering a 9 pound 10 ounce baby
I'm a bad motherfucker
Turn up!
I'm bad!
I'm bad!
I'm a bad mah'fucker
I'm bad!
I'm a bad mah'fucker
