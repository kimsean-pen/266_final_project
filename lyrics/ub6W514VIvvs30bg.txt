And a fall from you
is a long way down
I've found a better way out

And a fall from you
is a long way down
I know a better way out

Well, it's been a long time
since I've seen you smile
Gambled away my fright
'til the morning lights alight

It's been a long time
since I've seen you smile
Gambled away my fright
'til the morning lights alight

Sunday morning
only fog on the limbs
I called it again
What do you know

And I filled our days
with cards and gin
You're alight again, my dear

I will lead the way
Oh, lead the way when I know
And I'll sweep away
I'll sweep away what I don't
Well, seize the way
Oh, seize the way, no, I won't
I will lead the way
Oh, lead the day when I know
