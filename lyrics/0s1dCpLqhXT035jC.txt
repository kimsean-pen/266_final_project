Staring at a maple leaf
Leaning on the mother tree
I said to myself, "We all lost touch"
Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
And seedless watermelon, oh
Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rise
It puts over me

Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your
Strength

Remember seeking moons rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the earth
The sun was just yellow energy
It is a living promise land
Even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind and
Cover me
From bringing back
More than a memory

Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your
Strength

You'll be my vacation away from this place
You know what I want
Holding that cup
It's pouring over the sides
Make me wanna spread my arms and fly

Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your
Strength

Give me your strength
Chariot
Give me your strength
Chariot
Give me your strength
Chariot
Give me your strength
Chariot
Give me your strength (give it to me)
Chariot
Give me your strength (give it to me)
Chariot
Give me your strength (give it to me)
Chariot
Give me your strength, oh chariot
