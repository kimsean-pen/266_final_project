Rolling around like a big rubber ball
Writing this song about some things that I saw
Trying to stand like a big strong tough man
Finding out fast that I'm sinking in sand

All I got is nothing but a little bit of love
Gonna give it to the people then they'll see
Then they'll see

Spinning the tops as the tables they turn
Made some mistakes but I still couldn't learn
Covered my tracks, thought I was fine
Got no self control now I'm back here in line

All I got is nothing but a little bit of love
Gonna give it to the people then they'll see
Then they'll see
All I got is nothing but a little bit of love
Gonna give it to the people then they'll see
Then they'll see
