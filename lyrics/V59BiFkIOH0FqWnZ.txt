When I wake in the morning
I want to blow into pieces
I want more than just okay, more than just okay
When I'm up with the sunrise
I want more than just the blue skies
I want more than just okay, more than just okay

I'm not givin' up, givin' up, not givin' up now
I'm not givin' up, givin' up, not backing down

More than fine, more than bent on getting by
More than fine, more than just okay

When I'm lit with the sunshine
I want more than just a good time
I want more than just okay, more than just okay, okay

I'm not givin' up, givin' up, not givin' up now
I'm not givin' up, givin' up, I'm not selling out

More than fine, more than bent on getting by
More than fine, more than just okay
More than fine, more than bent on getting by
More than fine, more than just okay, okay

More than oceans away from the dawn
More than oceans away from the dawn
More than oceans away from who we are
More than oceans, more than oceans, yeah

More than fine, more than bent on getting by
More than fine, more than just okay, okay, okay, okay, fine
More than bent on getting by
More than fine, more than just okay, okay
