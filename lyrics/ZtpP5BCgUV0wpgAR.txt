Got my heart in a cage
And my soul is afflicted
If doubt was I crime
Then I'd be convicted

A voice in my head
Says I'm better off dead
Tell me
Where's the comfort in the misery

Came to the conclusion
That love is an illusion
We tip-toe around and I keep shutting my mouth
But silence is the match that's gonna burn us down

The fear inside won't let me go
Until my heart lets me move on

Until my heart lets me move

There's truth in the lies
Like I predicted
Devil in disguise
These thoughts are infectious

It's all in my mind
But I can't seem to find
A way out of the darkness
And just leave it all behind

Came to the conclusion
That love is an illusion
We tip-toe around and I keep shutting my mouth
But silence is the match that's gonna burn us down

Down

Burn us down

Down

The fear inside won't let me go
Until my heart lets me move on

The fear inside won't let me go
Until my heart lets me move on

The fear inside won't let me go
Until my heart lets me move on

The fear inside won't let me go
Until my heart lets me move on

Until my heart lets me move on
Until my heart lets me move
