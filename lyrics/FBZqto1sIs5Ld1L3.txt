Can't shake this feeling
At the end of each day
Then I keep on working hard and all I do is get paid.
Then I keep believing there's a line up ahead
'Cause it's only getting darker, and I could stay in my bed
It's a fine it takes so long but I've learnt to hold my own
So I stand and I wait in line with
a heavy head and this bottle of wine
And I watch as they steal my time
I stand and I wait in line
I stand and I wait in line
I walk home in the shadows
I carry my cage
And I hope they notice
What I brought to the stage
'Cause its a fine and it takes so long but I've learnt to hold my own
So I stand and I wait in line
With a heavy head and this bottle of wine
And I watch as they steal my time
I stand and I wait in line
I stand and I wait in line
Oh and then it gets inside
It's gets so hard to hide and then it gets inside
Oh I know you'll turn out right giving
it all my life I know you'll turn out right
And I stand and I wait in line with
a heavy head and this bottle of wine
And I watch as they steal my time
I know one day I'll get mine
And I stand here and wait in line
I stand and I wait in line
I stand and I wait in line
