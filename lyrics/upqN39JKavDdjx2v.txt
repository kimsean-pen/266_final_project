I was just a joker in a serious game
I didn't have the heart to play
But sooner or later
I'll find a reason to throw it away

Risin' on the crest of a natural wave
That never seems to break my way
I'm livin' without it
But I got to do somethin' about it

Step by step, little by little
(Move a little closer to me)
Step by step, take it line by line
(One day at a time)
Move, move, move, move a little closer
(Move a little closer to me)
Step by step, the deal is mine

I was just a runner in a one horse race
Livin' on the don't pass line
Sooner or later
I got to lose 'cause I'm wastin' my time

Lady luck must have been a wonderful girl
She's never been a friend of mine
I'm livin' without her
But I still got that mountain to climb

Step by step, little by little
(Move a little closer to me)
Step by step, take it line by line
(One day at a time)
Move, move, move, move a little closer
(Move a little closer to me)
Step by step, the deal is mine

Step by step, little by little
(Move a little closer to me)
Step by step, take it line by line
(One day at a time)
Move, move, move, move a little closer
(Move a little closer to me)
Step by step, the deal is mine
