The slow motion sin
The dead summer dance again
My chassy knows what could've been

I see how it happens now
It's all stretched out before me

My prime was a still frame
In your movie days, so late

We're close to dying twice
Projector of our life
Old Hollywood, holy bound

I see how it happens now
It's all stretched out before me
What could've been?

My prime was a still frame
In your movie days, so late
Those sirens sing on 42nd Street
And they've been calling my name out

What in you gets me so carried away?
I can't say yet, I can't

Love on repeat, it's life again
It's my flesh, my own blood
You vexed and sparked right from the start
So come and remind us

What in you gets me so carried away?
I can't say yet, I can't
