The patience I once had
Is running away with my youth
Away in a tent I've been
Neglecting who I am
Thats just who I was back then
Dont need to be perfect
Just happy
(Im still a lost boy)
(I'm still a lost boy)
Last year I was a train wreck now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
Every once in a while
I listen to death cab and think about how it used to be
We thought that we knew the answers
But no one was asking
Asking the questions
(I'm still a lost boy)
(I'm still a lost boy)
Last year I was a train wreck now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
It feels like I've been taking the long way
For a while now
Havent been at home in more years then I care to say
I keep letting my past carve out what the present shouldn't be
What I shouldn't be
Last year I was a train wreck now I'm just a mess
I'm letting go so I don't lose myself
I'm starting to be where I need to be
I'm starting to be where I need to be
