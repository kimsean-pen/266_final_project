I am She, Lilith
Mistress of the dark of Sheba
First offender, and succour to demons
Whose sweet seductions and wicked rites
Lead all too enslaved by the flesh
To trespass against God's holy law
And tonight I come for you

Midnight strikes, the candles sputter
Muttering their reeking spells
I snuff their tongues, my heart a-flutter
These words I speak are gates to Hell

These words I speak are gates to Hell
Casus belli, in hoc signo vinces, veritas vos liberabit
Casus belli, in hoc signo vinces, in aeternum, amen
Casus belli, in hoc signo vinces, veritas vos liberabit
Casus belli, in hoc signo vinces, in aeternum, amen

The scent of death is rent in this ornamental verse
In ventures down the centuries
Tormenting me with secrets so anathema
And now the fires grate, I must relate, to end this curse
I'll break through spires to escape my fate
Am I too late or just perverse?

Midnight strikes, the candles sputter
Muttering their reeking spells
I snuff their tongues, my heart a-flutter
These words I speak are gates to Hell

So the blight begins near the woodland of a frightened village
Where the rites of unimaginable sin
And the howling on the wind
Chills the blood for fear of spillage
Where nightfall used to be
Blessed with best tranquility
It's now caressed by misadventure
Templars cursed from the crusades
Have birthed a church, more masquerade
In which they worship mass dementia
They came from dust and flame
By the Red Sea on dead shores
Fleeing claims of blasphemy and bestiality
Devils fed them back to us
Knights of holy wars, inviting hordes of grim infidelities
In the grip of cryptic lands, and desert sands
They found just cause

And midst their entourage under the stars
They brought relics and parts of saints
And evil left to clerics charge
With Muslim plunder they built their sect
To the composite Baphomet
An androgynous sphinx, open, erect
Universal in its closet display
Spawn of Lilith and Samael
First offender and the snake
In thrall like pawns beneath its spell
The Templars grew to astute surrender
Sabbatical, fanatical they adorned its monstrous bust
With a king's ransom of Eastern jewels
The embodiment of beast and lust

Many moons then proved the boon of immutable beautiful
Darkness ever-afters
Then one eve when the ancient trees outside, drew back, unnerved
The pleas form those impatient, teased
Something from the black beyond of nowhere
A stunning woman, summoned
Comming scimitar-curved
Statuesque, but living flesh
Draping nakedness about their pagan saviours

She came Lilith, a perfect myth, the scarlet whore
Skinned in magnificence
In her defense she only slew a few of them
Born of a sacrifice, a virgin's price
For the merging with a Goddess
She prowled the world again
Enslaving men with the surging of her bodice

Midnight strikes, the candles sputter
Muttering their reeking spells
I snuff their tongues, my heart a-flutter
These words I speak are gates to Hell
Casus belli, in hoc signo vinces, veritas vos liberabit
Casus belli, in hoc signo vinces, in aeternum, amen
Casus belli, in hoc signo vinces, veritas vos liberabit
Casus belli, in hoc signo vinces, in aeternum, amen
