Enter the tiny room, watched by scepters,
Hope and happiness playing trumpets, dog swimming in heavy water
For the glory of gloom, dark songs on sunlight flower.
Enclosed in your skin.
All perfection spent in your arms.

Stolen kisses fa fa fa fa fa

In retrospect this beauty is, "What you see."
The second part, the move, "Is me."
Onwards and upwards,
The prize is the game to come.
And there's nothing to miss
In the laughter and tears of love.
There always are difficult mods,
Yet sensual bonds of obsession.
