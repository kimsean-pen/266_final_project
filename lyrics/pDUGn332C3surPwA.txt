I can feel
Illumination coming
What to do?
I look around at nothing
You must choose
To live in doubt and longing
My own rules
Are always best when broken

I want nothing but the best for us
Us, us, us, us, us

In a void
You put a lock on the door
But you ignore
Our vow, our vow, our vow, our vow
I'll stop at nothing

And I want nothing but the best for us
Us, us, us
