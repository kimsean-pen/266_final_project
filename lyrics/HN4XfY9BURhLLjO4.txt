Drop out. Repress. Dig in. Regress
I'm purging friends and backing out
Left alone in your post mourning doubt
I never kept in touch because i couldn't bear the thought
of the mal-de-mer inside your head that couldn't be un bought
Drop out. Repress. Dig in . Repress.
Shut in. Eat pills. Feel worth in your own reflection
