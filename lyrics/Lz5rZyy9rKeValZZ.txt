Home is something you don't have.
The eyes that look through all these pages.
The one that's devilishly foolish.
The eyes that make us gray.
Once...
I Iost my foot again.
I slip and fall to you.
I have no light at all.
I fall dead.
You miss me.
I break my promise to keep.
You owe...
Want black rainbows.
I fail.
I fail.
The ones who call...

You call to find you.
They rest their heads to fake their death.
Once the mines will cover you in dust---dirt.
To make us feel alone again, because you won't let go again.
And I confess with...
You...
You make me bleed again.
You make me maim again.
You make me cry again.
I fall dead.
You miss me.
I break in time.
For you.
You want black rainbows.
I fail.
I fail.
I fail.
