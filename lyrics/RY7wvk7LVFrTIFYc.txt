Yeah I'd stoop to that.
Sure I would.
Yeah you've been had.

That's how I got my job at the underwriter's lab.
That's how I threw a wrench in everything I had a chance to.
That's how I fixed it.
That's what I did.

And now my knees are spotless and my legs are crossed.
And I needn't spread them.
Cause i can afford:
Piety, chastity, charity, your company.

That's how I lost my job at the underwriter's lab.
That's how I threw a wrench in everything I had a chance to.
That's how I fixed it.
That's what I did.
