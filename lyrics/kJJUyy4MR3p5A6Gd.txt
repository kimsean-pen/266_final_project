Stuck at a fork in the road, which way should I go?
One path leads me home, the other leaves me alone
The impact of one choice is so endless
Can't even think of how it plays out in time
Through the years, it's still there
Won't disappear
The impact of one choice is so endless
Through all these years, it still won't disappear
So tell me now, 'cause I don't wanna stay in the dark for so long while my
whole life gets away
Is the secret out, will anybody say?
The clearest path to start down, or which road is right to take
Carefully, I think of ways out now 'cause I don't want to hold in
This burden weighs so heavily
the though of what I love being swayed,
unstable choices I might make
Through all these years, it still won't disappear
So tell me now, 'cause I don't wanna stay in the dark for so long while my
whole life gets away
Is the secret out, will anybody say?
The clearest path to start down, or which road is right to take
The impact of one choice is so endless
So tell me now...
So tell me now, 'cause I don't wanna stay
Left in the dark for so long, while my whole life gets away
Is the secret out, will anybody say?
The clearest path to start down, or which road is right to take
