Whoa nah nah I ain't an amatuer
Baby I know how to handle you
If you're ready for this ride get your saddle up

I need a boy with some stamina
He had me all year, Now he back around
'cause he like the way I put it down
You come be my student, i'mma be your teacher

Let's play a little game, follow the leader
I give a little lesson in the sex education

You know I can work it like that
I got'em working over time, there be no time for waste
And I co-co-could keep him coming back
So soft - my skin
So soft - my booty
So soft - my bed

So soft, I got 'em sayin'

They wanna take me next semester
To them I'm a professor
So you say that you a bachelor

Let's take your game up and get your master
Bad grade if you do not behave
Don't compare me to them other girls, we're not the same
Don't drop out, stay in the game
Better come hardcore, you know my name
I give a little lesson in the sex education
You know I can work it like that
I got'em working over time, there be no time for waste

And I co-co-could keep him coming back
So soft - my skin
So soft - my booty
So soft - my bed

So soft, I got 'em sayin'
