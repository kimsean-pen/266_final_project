Voices, in my head again
Trapped in a war inside my own skin
They're pulling me under
Go

I've swallowed myself but the fever remains
I'm numb to the pleasure but still feel the pain
If I showed you my soul would you cover your eyes?
If I told you the truth would you dare me to lie?

I keep it all inside because I know the man is everything but kind

Voices in my head again
Baiting me in a war I can't win
I can hear them now
Trapped in a game inside my own skin
And I don't know myself anymore
They're pulling me under
Voices, voices

As I walk through this valley of shadows and death
I curse not the "wicked", I praise not the "blessed"
If I told you the truth, you'd beg me to change
If fear were a currency, you'd own the bank

Voices, In my head again
Baiting me in a war I can't win
I can hear them now
Trapped in a game inside my own skin
And I don't know myself anymore
They're pulling me under
Voices

I don't want to live
So calloused and frozen
Ugly and hopeless
I don't want to live forever
I just want to live right now
You can't take me from me
Voices in my head again
Head again

Voices in my head again
Baiting me in a war I can't win
I can hear them now
Trapped in a game inside my own skin
And I don't know myself anymore
They're pulling me under
Voices
(They're pulling me under)
Voices
They're pulling me under
Voices, voices

I keep it all inside because I know the man is everything but kind
I keep it all inside because I know the man is everything but kind
