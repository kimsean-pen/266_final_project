One life I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight I said "I'll never get enough"
Stand tall I'm a young and kinda proud
I'm on the top as long as the music's loud

If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go you're mad

You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'

That's right here's where the talkin' ends
Well listen this is night there'll be some action spent
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks

If you think I'll sit around you chip away my brain
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go you're mad

You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'

In this world we're livin' in
We have our share of sorrow
Answer now is don't give in
Aim for a new tomorrow

And oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah
Act tough ain't room for second best
Real strong got me some security
Hey I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah

If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go you're mad

You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing

You've got another thing comin'
Hey yeah it's a comin' now come on
You've got another thing comin'
Yeah yeah yeah

You've got another thing comin'
You're on talk about a deadly boy
You've got another thing comin'
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another birdie comin'

You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'

You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
