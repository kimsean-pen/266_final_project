I'm sorry to have been so much of a bore
But in my own funny way I find I learn much more
I realise what you think from your eyes
But in your own funny ways I find I learn much more

My ways are strange
They'll never change
They stay, strange ways

I'm sorry to have been so close from the start
But for all that I cared we could be miles apart
I understood that you never would
Understand a way of life that I never could

My ways are strange
They'll never change
They stay, strange ways

Go your own way or wait for me
Go your own way or wait for me
Go your own way or wait for me
Go your own way or wait for me

And so you see what happened to me
Since the time when I judged my life in nights and days
I realised that my life was lies
So you see what I mean with all my funny ways

I'm sorry to have been so much of a bore
But in my own funny ways I find I learn much more
Funny ways
Funny ways
Funny ways
Funny ways
