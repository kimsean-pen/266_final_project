In and out of breathing
Up all throughout the long night
Can't seem to come out ever
In brighter days of harsh light
What stumbles to the gates now
Won't share a shred of empathy
Just seems to fall apart now
A rogue to chart a vagrant sea
It's on or just none other
Fingertips of fallacy
Holding on to anything
That gets down on bended knees
Within the confines of wilted hearts
Fall on hard times and fall apart
Within the the motions to receive
The parting words I'll never read
(Forever and Ever)
(When I come to)
(I want to)
(I want to)
