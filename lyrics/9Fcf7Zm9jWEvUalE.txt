Your love, liftin' me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
And I'll be at your side forevermore

You know your love (Your love keeps liftin' me)
Keep on liftin' (Your love keeps liftin' me)
Higher (Liftin' me, liftin' me), higher, and higher (Higher)
I said your love (Your love keeps liftin' me)
Keep on (Liftin' me, liftin' me)
Liftin' me (Liftin' me) higher and higher (Higher)
Listen

Now once I was downhearted
Disappointment was my closest friend
But then you came and he soon departed
And you know he never showed his face again

That's why your love (Your love keeps liftin' me)
Keep on liftin' me (Your love keeps liftin' me)
Higher (Liftin' me, liftin' me), higher, and higher (Higher)
I said your love (Your love keeps liftin' me)
Keep on (Liftin' me, liftin' me)
Liftin' me (Liftin' me) higher and higher (Higher)
Alright

I'm so glad I finally found you
Yes, that one in a million girl
And now with my lovin' arms around ya
Honey, I can stand up and face the world

Let me tell you, your love (Your love keeps liftin' me)
Keep on liftin' (Your love keeps liftin' me)
Higher (Liftin' me, liftin' me), higher, and higher (Higher)
I said your love (Your love keeps liftin' me)
Keep on (Liftin' me, liftin' me)
Liftin' me (Liftin' me) higher, and higher (Higher)

Alright, now sock it to me (Lifting, lifting, lifting)
Alright, lift me up woman (Your love keeps lifting me)
Keep my love going, now (Lifting me)
Higher and higher
I said keep on lifting (Lifting, lifting, lifting)
Lift me up mama (Your love keeps lifting me)
