I shake my head and shiver
They smile
And then stab my back as they shake my hand
Send out an SOS plea
Come quickly
I'm marooned in monkeyland.
Is there anyone there
Who understands me
Anyone at all

I'm idly staring at the sky
Did anybody hear me sigh
A million stars are a moving sight
To all you out there
Hearing this tonight
It's just a trick of the light

I have to know what is real
And what is illusion
ohhh, how does it feel
Beyond this confusion
Is there anyone there

Do I dismiss this with a sigh
oh yes you must from time to time
And let the answers pass me by
To questions set to bend the mind
Is my creator a God or a man
Does someone somewhere
Care or understand
It's just a trick of the light

I have to know what is real
And what is illusion
Tell me how does it feel
Beyond this confusion

for all the tricks of the light
yeah for all the tricks of the light
out there tonight, tonight

Life's an optical illusion
Like other optical illusions
Beware
If there's anyone there
