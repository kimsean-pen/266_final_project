Children, I wanna warn ya
(Wo-oh-oh)
'Cause I've been to California
(Wo-oh-oh)

Where Mickey Mouse is such a demon
(Wo-oh-oh)
Where Mickey Mouse is as big as a house
(Wo-oh-oh)

Ba da bop a da da Wo-oh-oh
Ba da bop a da da
Life is wasted on illusions
(Wo-oh-oh)

Tom and Jerry's no solution
(Wo-oh-oh)
Evil games for cartoon demons
(Wo-oh-oh)

Pinocchio's a real boy, look around
Ba da bop a da da Wo-oh-oh
Ba da bop a da da
And I cry all night
Do you wanna hold me, hold me tight?

Do you wanna hold me, oh yeah?
Do you wanna hold me, hold me there?
Children, you got to hear me
(Wo-oh-oh)

You've just got to understand me
(Wo-oh-oh)
Love and death ain't no physical thing
(Wo-oh-oh)

'Cause Mickey Mouse, he don't wanna know!
(Wo-oh-oh)
Ba da bop a da da Wo-oh-oh

Ba da bop a da da
And I cry all night
Do you wanna hold me, hold me tight?
Do you wanna hold me, oh yeah?

Do you wanna hold me, hold me there?
Do you wanna?
And I cry all night
Do you wanna hold me? Hold me tight?
Do you wanna hold me? Oh yeah!
Do you wanna hold me? Hold me there?
And I cry all night
There ain't no more confusion in the night
There's someone there to tell me what is right
Do you wanna hold me, hold me tight?
And I cry all night
There's only one solution to this life
There's someone there to tell me what it's like
Do you wanna hold me? Oh yeah!
Do you wanna hold me? Oh yeah!
Do you wanna hold me? Hold me there?
Do you wanna hold meeeeeeeeee?
(Do you wanna hold me? Oh yeah!)
Do ya?
