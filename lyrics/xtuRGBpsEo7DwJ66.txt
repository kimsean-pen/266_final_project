Yeah, I'm lost and numb, cold to the touch
I pretend like I don't remember your name
Every masterpiece turns to blasphemy
When I close my eyes, yeah, I still see your face

We were the thunder and the lightning
Burning fires started from a spark
I would stay there just to watch you twirl
It was us against the world

You were the rain falling on my skin
Yeah, I was dying when you pulled me in
I was your rebel and you were my girl
It was us against the world

I was your rebel and you were my girl
It was us against the world

Yeah, I'm pale and gray, all dust and frail
When I call for you, all I hear back is pain
Every song must end, even diamonds fade
When the darkness comes I count up my mistakes

We were the thunder and the lightning
Burning fires started from a spark
I would stay there just to watch you twirl
It was us against the world

You were the rain falling on my skin
Yeah, I was dying when you pulled me in
I was your rebel and you were my girl
It was us against the world

We were the thunder and the lightning

I was your rebel and you were my girl
It was us against the world
