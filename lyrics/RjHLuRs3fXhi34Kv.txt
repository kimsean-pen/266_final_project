(phillips, club, glib)

Get in your cell
Don't talk back
Get in your cell
Or I'll put you on a rack
Get in your cell
Don't talk back
Get in your cell
Or I'll put you on a rack

I gotta get out of this mental ward
The stink in my cell has got me totally floored
I'm so sick and tired of being ignored
Yeah my mental ward

Repeat first verse

Chorus

Lead

Chorus

Mental ward
It's my mental ward
Mental ward
It's my mental ward

Chorus
