We're Born Young And Free
We're Born Young And Free
We're Born Young And Free
We're Born Young And Free
Come with me to a quiet place and get some rest
Cos you're tired and hungry unlike all the other guests
Shake the dust of your feet and show them who's best
Make or break on a long road, let's go west

We can go wherever we want cos we're free yeah we're free
We can do whatever we want cos we're born young and free
We're born young and free

Now we know where we're going let's get dressed
I didn't even realize we could be this blessed
Shake the dust off our feet and show them who's best, let's show them.
Make or break on a long road, let's go west

We can go wherever we want cos we're free yeah we're free
We can do whatever we want cos we're born young and free
We're born young and free

We don't care, we don't care, we don't give a rip.
