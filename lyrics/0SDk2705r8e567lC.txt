Hot pink skies, twilight of the day
I think that I've been going about this the wrong way
Kids on my street got it right, man there for hide and seek
My best friend she lives up the road, haven't talked to her in weeks

Oh, time don't blind me, I am so sorry
I've been swept up in my own concerns
And the worldly matters they just don't matter at all
No not at all

I keep on walking, I start ditching all my plans
I wanna climb that cedar tree and leave me in good hands
What happened to me on the way to something higher?
And we'll be left when I have all that I desire

Oh, time don't blind me, I am so sorry
I've been swept up in my own concerns
And the worldly matters they just don't matter at all
No not at all, no not at all
