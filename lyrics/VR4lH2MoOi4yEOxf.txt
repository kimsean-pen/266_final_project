i see lights in the sky
a fire in your eyes
you're shapeshifting again
a blister on my tongue
when i lick something dumb
im feeling numb
and you're paranoid
dwell on the threshold with me
im a light writer
im a suicide door
and im feeling paranormal again
lunatic fringe lifestylist
you're a dangerous conspiracist
and im feeling paranormal again
