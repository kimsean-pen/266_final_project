Tears will leave no stain
Time will ease the pain
For every light that fades
Something beautiful remains

We're living in a world of stars and dust
Between heaven and all that surrounds us
We're travelers here, spirits passing through
And the love we give, is all that will endure

Hey now, what we had is gone
But I still remember you
Just like a rose after the rain
Something beautiful remains

Chorus:
Tears will leave no stain
Time will ease the pain
For every light that fades
Something beautiful remains

Now the darkness falls, the sun's going down
One by one, the stars are coming out
Tide comes in, washes footprints from the sand
As one day ends, a new day must begin

Hey now, though we are apart
You're here forever in my dreams
Hey now, love is lost and gained
(What you gonna do about it, what you gonna say)
Something beautiful remains

Chorus

And you wonder sometimes how we carry on
When you've lost the love you knew
But it's alright, it's alright
To your own heart be true

Chorus
