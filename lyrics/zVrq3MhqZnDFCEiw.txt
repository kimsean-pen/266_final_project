Even when you're home
You won't pick up your phone
And take my call
When I see you on the street
You stare down at your feet
You won't talk at all

If only you would see me
One more time and maybe
Some day you will find
That you could really love me
You colud really need me
Maybe you could change your mind

But you'll never stop me from loving you
It doesn't really matter what you put me through
You'll never stop me from loving you

When I know that you're alone
I wander to your home
And catch a glimpse or two
It seems that all the time
The thought is on my mind
Of being with you

The times I've tried to see you
You know I would meet you
Any time, night or day
But still you just refuse
And no matter what you do
I'll never let you get away

But you'll never stop me from loving you
It doesn't really matter what you put me through
You'll never stop me from loving you

Oh, woh, you'll never stop me from loving you
Wherever you can go, I will follow you
You'll never stop me from loving you

Oh, woh, oh, woh
Never stop
Never stop me
Oh, woh, oh, woh
Never stop
Never stop me

If only you would see me
One more time and maybe
Some day you will find
That you could change your mind

But you'll never stop me from loving you
It doesn't really matter what you put me through
You'll never stop me from loving you

Oh, woh, you'll never stop me from loving you
Wherever you can go, I will follow you
You'll never stop me from loving you.
