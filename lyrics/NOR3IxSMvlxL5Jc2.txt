Drain Gang
Take a knife and drain your life
RIP Bladee, RIP Ripsquadd

You, you, you you
You destroy me
You, make me break

I like you, you're like glue, I want to breathe through you
I like you cause you hold me together
I like you, you're like food
I need you, I eat you
I hate you cause you make me dependent

You, you, you you
You destroy me
You make me break
You, you you you
You destroy me
You, make me break

What I do Is what I do
I can't explain to you
In the wind I'll be gone like a feather
I want to bury you
Next to me, yeah its true
Ill be blue next to you, up in heaven
