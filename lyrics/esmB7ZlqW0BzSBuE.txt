"Look at me, see the love that you're missing
Can't you see, that I'll always be there
you can't run, you can't hide from the feeling tonight
Damage Done, I guess love isn't fair

Sometimes I wonder who you are
So close, but we've gone too far

How long can I hold on till you say good-bye baby
you're gone and it's so wrong and now my heart cries for you girl

Lonely days, fill my nights with such sorrow
Shades of grey, turn into blue tomorrows...

Sometimes I wonder where you are
So close, but your eyes are so far...

*Chorus*
How long can I hold on till you say good-bye baby
you're gone and it's so wrong and now my heart cries for you girl
How long can I hold on till you say good-bye baby
you're gone and it's so wrong and now my heart cries for you girl
