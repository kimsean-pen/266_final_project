Pushed aside like a stranger in the crowd
Cut so many times I don't bleed out
And you keep trying but can't hold me down

I always knew that we could make it through
But you can have your doubts, you can have your doubts
I think it's time for you to move along, move along

We're setting fire to the weight that held us down
We're burning brighter and you're gonna hear us now
Cause we're singing whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
This is the road, the road to the throne

Waiting for us to roll into our grave
No grief, no tears just forgotten names
You really think that we would go that easily?

I always knew that we could make it through
But you can have your doubts, you can have your doubts
I think it's time for you to move along, move along

We're setting fire to the weight that held us down
We're burning brighter and you're gonna hear us now
Cause we're singing whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
This is the road, the road to the throne

You said we were worthless
And how we're not worth your time
But now you come running back to us
But we don't care cause we never needed you

We're setting fire to the weight that held us down
We're burning brighter and you're gonna hear us now
We're singing whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
This is the road, the road to the throne
We're setting fire to the weight that held us down
We're burning brighter and you're gonna hear us now
Cause we're singing whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
This is the road, the road to the throne
