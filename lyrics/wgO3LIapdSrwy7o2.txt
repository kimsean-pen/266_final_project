Let's love

My graveyard is bleeding again
Beatings in my carved veins
Velvet love pinip' away
Swallowing my memories again

Memories of deep death

Let's love

They are creeping while
We are dancing around the graves
Tonight it's a funny game
The game of nightshades

Don't take care about
All their arms are pinin' high
But laugh aloud again
At the game of nightshades

My playground is hiding my crimes
Made of victims from sweet bones
Now their shame is crying grief...
They are dying through this winter's day
Memories of dead stars

They are creeping while
We are dancing around the graves
Tonight's a funny game
The game of nightshades

Jump and dance tonight
All around these bloody graves
And laugh aloud again
As the coil of shades
