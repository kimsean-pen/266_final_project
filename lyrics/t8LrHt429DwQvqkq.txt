I'm sure I'd recognize you if I lost my memory
There's no voice on earth that speaks so sweet
I hope the next lifetime you'll be somewhere next to me
Like two blades of grass beneath a tree

I know that it's not always perfect
If I had the chance I'd do it all again
Oh, again
Oh, again

I've only experienced a grain of sand with you
In the scale of things our love is new
If I was a star I'd always be right in your view
And someday I'd hope you'd see me too

I know that it's not always perfect
If I had the chance I'd do it all again
Oh, again
Oh, again
Oh, again
Oh, again

I know that it's not always perfect
If I had the chance I'd do it all again
Oh, again
