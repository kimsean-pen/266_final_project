La, la, la, la, la
Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the floor and move your booty mama
We the blast masters blastin' up the jamma

(Rewind)

Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
Hey shorty, I know you wanna party
The way your body look really make me really feel naughty

Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
Hey shorty, I know you wanna party
The way your body look really make me really feel naughty

I got a naughty naughty style and a naughty naughty crew
But everything I do, I do just for you
I'm a little bit of old, and a bigger bit of Nu
The true niggers know that the peas come thru
We never cease (naa)
We never die no we never decease (naa)
We multiply like we mathamatice
Then we drop bombs like we in the middle east

(The bomb bombas, the base move dramas)

Naw y'all knaw, who we are
Y'all knaw, we the stars
Steady rockin' on y'alls boulevards
And, lookin' hard without bodyguards

(I do) what I can
(Y'all come thru) Will.i.am
And still I stand, with still mic in hand
(So come on mama, dance to the drama)

Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
(Hey) get on the floor and move your booty mama
(Yaw) we the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
(Hey) so shake your bambama, come on now mama

Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
(Hey) get on the floor and move your booty mama
(Yaw) we the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
La, la, la, la, la

We the big town stumpas, and big sound pumpas
The beat bump bumps in your trunk trunkas
The girlies in the club with the big plump plumpas
And when I'm makin' love, my hip hump humps
It never quits (naa)
We need to carry 9mm clips (naa)
Don't wanna squize trigger, just wanna squeeze tits
(Lubaluba) 'cause we the show stoppas
And the chief rockas, number one chief rockas

Naw y'all knaw, who we are
Y'all knaw, we the stars
Steady rockin' on y'alls boulevards
How we rockin' it girl, without bodyguards
Now she be, Fergie, from the crew
B.E.P.come and take heed, as we take the lead
(So come on papa, dance to the drama)

Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
(Yaw) get on the floor and move your booty mama
(Wuh) we the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
(Naw, naw)

Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
Hey shorty, I know you wanna party
The way your body look really make me feel naughty

But the race is not, for the Swiss
But who really can, take control of it
And Tippa Irie and the Black Eyed Peas will be there
Til infinity, til infinity, til infinity, til infinity, til infinity
Tippa is out

Nosa dima shock, nosa dima ting
Everytime you sit there I hear, bling bling
O wata ting, hear blacka sing
Grinding, and winding
And the madda be moving in a perfect timing
And we dance and dance to the dancehall riddim
And we're really to nice, it finga lickin'
Like rice and peas and chicken stuffing

Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
(Hey) get on the floor and move your booty mama
(Yaw) we the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
(Hey) so shake your bambama, come on now mama

Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
(Hey) get on the floor and move your booty mama
(Yaw) we the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
La, la, la, la, la
