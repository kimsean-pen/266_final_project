Do it, try it
Do it, try it
Do it, try it
Do it

Listen to the sound
Of a new tomorrow
Take over my dreams
Walk into the feeling

A dance on repeat
A trance of a heartbeat
A dance on repeat
A trance of a heartbeat

Do it, try it
Do it, try it
Do it

You sing to the sound
Like a shot in the night
Moving at the tempo
Of a broken song

A dance on repeat
A trance of a heartbeat
A dance on repeat
A trance of a heartbeat

Listen to the sound
Of a broken heart
Calling for a sign of love
Heal me up
Turn me on

A dance on repeat
A trance of a heartbeat
A dance on repeat
A trance of a heartbeat

Listen to the sound
Of a broken heart
Calling for a sign of love
Heal me up
Turn me on
Do it, try it
Do it, try it
