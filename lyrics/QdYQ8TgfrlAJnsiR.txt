The problem is, for many years
I've lived my life publicly
So it's hard for me to find a man
I trust, I really trust

And every time I find someone I like
Gotta worry about if it's really me
That they see
And I thought you were the one, oh

Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain old Mary, Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain old Mary, Mary

I don't have a lot of friends
And sometimes I have to wonder
Is it cash they see when they look at me
Cause they're looking for a ride that's free
So I made the choice to be
Good to those who were good to me
Don't judge me or think I'm bitter
For the evil God's allowed me to see
I'm just Mary

I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
(I'm just Mary, can't you see that I, I)
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
(I said, I said I'm just Mary)
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
(Oh yeah, yeah)

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

It's the car I drive
The clothes I wear
The diamonds, the furs, and the house
Don't make the woman
Material things don't mean a thing to me
So I need someone to stand by me
And supply my needs
And I'm just plain old Mary
Why can't you love the person inside
And stop looking outside

Repeat 1 while:
I said I'm just Mary, eh
All day, all night, I'm Mary, Mary, Mary, oh
Said I wish and I wish and I wish and I wish
I wish that they could see that I'm Mary J.
MJB, yeah

If I can give you something else
But I can't give you nuthin' but me
All day and all night
I'm just Mary, Mary, Mary
It can't be the clothes or the car I drive
Cuz I, I, I
See the problem is for many years
I've lived my life publicly
And every time I find a man, I, I can't trust him.
