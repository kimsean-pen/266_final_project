In my mother's house
There's a photograph
Of a day gone past
Always makes me laugh

There's a little girl
Wary of the world
She got much to learn
Get her fingers burned

An infinity
Between you and me
'Coz we're family, yeah

Said that I'd be fine
Give me all your time
And I left your side
Like a butterfly

Shower me with your love
All of everyday
You make the milk of
Sunshine on me, yeah

Lift me up so high
Watch me fly away
Would you give your life
Like a butterfly?

In my mother's house
There was happiness
I wrapped my myself in it
Was my chrysalis

As my life unfolds
See a pattern through
Of you protecting me
And I protecting you

What was I to say?
Make your own mistakes
And when you woke
Made sure that you remained the same

Now I realize
What was on your mind
When I left your side
Like a butter fly

Shower me with your love
All of everyday
You make the milk of
Sunshine on me, yeah

Lift me up so high
Watch me fly away
And give me a life
Like a butterfly

Hey, shower me, yeah
Shower me with your love
All of everyday
You make the milk of
Sunshine on me, yeah

Lift me up so high
Watch me fly away
And to give me a life
Like a butterfly
