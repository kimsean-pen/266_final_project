Come on down to the spot where you know you can find me
I left the house and I took the key, I'll drive my mom's red minivan
Driving down the hill, yeah we're picking up speed
Just hit the brakes, I've never felt so free, cut the wheel, accelerate

I know you're gonna break my heart again
I know you're gonna tear it all apart again
This time will be different than the last

Connect the dots and draw the line
The fault is your, wait the fault is mine
I put it in park and I turned out the lights
I don't care if you wanna go
Just don't say that I told you so
Anytime is better than now

I know you're gonna break my heart again
I know you're gonna tear it all apart again
This time will be different than the last
I know you're gonna break my heart again
I know you're gonna tear it all apart again
This time will be different than the last
