The bridge is all crumbled, the water soaks into rocks
That fell at the bottom of the road (at the end of the town)
The town that we lived in, the memories shaken apart
From the weeds that grow

Over the sidewalks
Running away from the streets we knew
Sidewalks, like the time we thought was made for you

Out on the front porch watching the cars as they go by
Eighteen blue, twenty-one gray
Looking ahead for the first time that we could drive out on our own
To speed away

From the sidewalks
Running away from the streets we knew
Sidewalks, like the time we thought was made for you

All of the days have passed us by
All of the sun is gone...
Away

Sidewalks, running away from the streets we knew

Sidewalks, running away from the streets we knew
Sidewalks, like the time we thought was made for you
(Sidewalks) The bridge is all crumbled, the water soaks into rocks
(Sidewalks) That fell at the bottom of the road
