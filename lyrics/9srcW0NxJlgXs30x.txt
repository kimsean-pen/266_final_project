My eye is the vortex from which nothing escapes
I am dematerialization of the self
I am the axis in the wheel of reincarnation
The endless singularity

I turn the spirals of existence
I am the slowing pace of life
I am the pulse of creation
Of inevitability and destruction
I balance the shifting tides of life
Everything must return... to me

I am the beginning
And I am the end
