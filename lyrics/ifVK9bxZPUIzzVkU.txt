As I did walk by Hampstead Fair
I came upon Mother Goose
So I turned her loose
She was screaming

And a foreign student said to me
Was it really true
There are elephants and lions too
In Picadilly Circus?

Walked down by the bathing pond
To try and catch some sun
Saw at least a hundred schoolgirls
Sobbing into handkerchiefs as one
I don't believe they knew
I was a schoolboy

And a bearded lady said to me
If you start your raving
And your misbehaving
You'll be sorry
Then the chicken-fancier came to play
With his long red beard
And his sister's weird
She drives a lorry

Laughed down by the putting green
I popped 'em in their holes
Four and twenty labourers were labouring
Digging up their gold
i don't believe they knew
That I was Long John Silver

Saw Johnny Scarecrow make his rounds
In his jet-black mac
Which he won't give back
Stole it from a snowman
