Show me, show me, show me a starry-eyed kid
I, I, I will break his jaw
I won't, I won't, I won't let him get his hopes up
No-o, o-o, o-o

And I will save him from himself
Here's a picture with a note
"No, don't turn out like me
It's only for your own good"

No-o, o-o, o-o
And haven't you heard?
The word on the street is
"I lost it, called it quits"

Get into the sun
Out from behind the gossip
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
This story's getting old

The home wrecker with a heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind
Keep, k-keep talking, keep this alive
This story's getting old

The home wrecker with a heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind
Now-ow, ow-ow, ow-ow

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

Even when there's n-n-n-nothing worth living for
You're still, you're still, still worth lying for
N-no one has to know-ow, ow-ow, ow-ow
And haven't you heard?

The word on the street is
"I lost it, called it quits"
Get into the sun
Out from behind the gossip

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
This story's getting old
The home wrecker with a heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind

Keep k-keep talking, keep this alive

And this story's getting old
(This story's getting old)
The home wrecker with a heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind

Now-ow, ow-ow, ow-ow
This story's getting old
The home wrecker with a heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind
Keep, k-keep talking, keep this alive
This story's getting old
(This story's getting old)
The home wrecker with a heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind
Now-ow, ow-ow, ow-ow
N-n-now-ow, ow-ow, ow-ow
N-n-now-ow, ow-ow, ow-ow
N-n-now-ow, ow-ow, ow-ow
Stop!
