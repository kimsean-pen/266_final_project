I'm paranoid
Here you come again, we can't avoid
The walls are caving in
Blame it on chemicals badly reacting, your poison's addicting, you're body's distracting
I'm all strung out
I don't know where you've been, you led me down
This crooked path and then
You're twisting and turning, you're lighting and burning
All you can give me, it's cold and it's empty, but I'd still be with you if only you let me

You're inside of me messing up my everything
But you don't care
You don't care, your misery is looking for some company
And I was there
I was there
I was there in the clouds when you came around
Tell me why every high has a come down
Has a come down

You're haunting me
You're in my head again, you pull my strings
I'm just a puppet and
You keep control of a part of my soul, is this never ending, 'cause I'm still admitting
I'd still be with you if only you let me

You're inside of me messing up my everything
But you don't care
You don't care, your misery is looking for some company
And I was there, yeah

Tell me why every high has a come down x2
