With the Golem you'll fly
Ripping over your eyes
Nothing stopping you now
Cover over the sky
People burning alive
Fire on the mountain
No escape in sight
Even heavens above
They will all come down
Make you frozen in space
Fire on your face
Won't you think of me now

What a thought of mine
To be seen here alive
What a thought I had
Maybe someday I'll come
Maybe someday I'll fly
Maybe someday I'll travel

Happiness
Happiness
