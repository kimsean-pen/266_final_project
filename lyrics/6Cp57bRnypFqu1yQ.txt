Something I need to say
Before we carry on

We'll make it right
Hope we'll still be here tomorrow
No need to cry
Fearing something we can conquer

Take it easy and only
Let it go for a while

We're right on time to rise through it all
We're right on time to rise through it all

We'll make it right
Hope we'll still be here tomorrow
No need to cry
Fearing something we can conquer

Wake up now, for a time
Tell me what's on your mind

I'll take your hand and lead you through it all

Something I need to say
Before we carry on

There's something in the way
We got it all so wrong

Something I need to say
Before we carry on
