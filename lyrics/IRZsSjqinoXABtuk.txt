It's a sad affair
When there's no one there
He calls out in the night

And it's so unfair
At least it seems that way
When you gave him his life

And all this time he's been getting you down
You ought to pick him up when there's no one around
And convince him, oh just talk to him
'Cause he knows in his heart you won't be home soon
'Cause he's an only child in an only room
And he's dependent on you
Oh he's dependent on you

And it seems so strange
That at the end of the day
Making love can be so good

But the pain of birth
Ooh what is it worth
When it don't turn out the way it should

And all this time he's been getting you down
You ought to pick him up when there's no one around
And convince him, oh just talk to him
'Cause he knows in his heart you won't be home soon
'Cause he's an only child in an only room
And he's dependent on you
Oh he's dependent on you

Suffer the
Suffer the children
Suffer the
Suffer the children
Suffer the
Suffer the children
