I only wanna dance with you
All night, on the street
Well I'm gonna take you everywhere
And never ask you who you are
We don't need to pretend

Sinewed serpent
Gold-encrusted
Silver-tongued
Electric current

I think it's possible
We have the same dream
But I don't expect you to believe
I'm never gonna give it up
We don't need to pretend

Sinewed serpent
Filth-encrusted
Silver-tongued
Electric current
