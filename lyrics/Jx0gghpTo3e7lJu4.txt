Crossing my life
Ravenous minds
Falling 'till I disappear
Crossing my life
Ravenous minds
There is no way out of here

Look in my eyes and see
Behind the veil of obscurity
I lay me down to sleep
Losing my fate but soul to keep
Watching me 'till the end
A soul has passed to burn again
Dark shadow is often there
Spread their wings to will this end

It's running through my veins
Say a prayer
Cast a spell
I'm causing the living hell

Crossing my life
Ravenous minds
Falling 'till I disappear
Crossing my life
Ravenous minds
There is no way out of here

Crawling inside the mind
Here's the fight to face my crimes
Pulling the strings behind
The seams to harm and fear the mind
If all the world could see
Me for who I used to be
Leaving me barrenly
I still hear you in my sleep

The curse reveals my mind
Say a prayer
Cast a spell
I'm causing the living hell

Crossing my life
Ravenous minds
Falling 'till I disappear
Crossing my life
Ravenous minds
There is no way out of here

Crossing my life
Ravenous minds
Falling 'till I disappear
Crossing my life
Ravenous minds
There is no way out of here

There is no way out of here
When all is lost and all is gone
There is no way to choose
Right from wrong

Crossing my life
Ravenous minds
Falling 'till I disappear
Crossing my life
Ravenous minds
There is no way out of here

Crossing my life
Ravenous minds
Falling 'till I disappear
Crossing my life
Ravenous minds
There is no way out of here

Crossing my life
Ravenous minds
Falling 'till I disappear
Crossing my life
Ravenous minds
There is no way out of here
