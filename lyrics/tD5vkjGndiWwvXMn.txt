I caught the darkness
It was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness
Drinking from your cup
I said, "Is this contagious?"
You said, "Just drink it up."

I've got no future
I know my days are few
The presence, not that pleasant
Just a lot of things to do
I thought the past would last me
But the darkness got there too.

I should've seen it coming
It was red behind your eyes
You're young and it was summer
I just had to take a dive
Winning you was easy
But darkness was the price.

I don't smoke no cigarette
I don't drink no alcohol
I ain't had much loving yet
But that's always been your call
I don't miss it baby
I got no taste for anything at all

I used to love the rainbow
And I used to love the view
Another early morning
I pretend that it was new
But I caught the darkness, baby
And I got it worse than you.

I caught the darkness
It was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness
Drinking from your cup
I said, "Is this contagious?"
You said, "Just drink it up."
