Hotshot, have you got a clue how long I've been pining for you?
Spent so many sleepless nights in unbaptized decline
But in our parallel minds, we were just killing time
'Til our collision catalyst
Yeah, yeah

The awful truth has eluded you for too long
Uh-oh, everything you know is all wrong

There is no substance left for the wyrm to eat itself
Such callow uncertainty in these pantomime end times
Sucks to be an optimist in this listless dissolution
It's just a triptych in decay
Yeah, yeah

The awful truth has eluded you for too long
Uh-oh, everything you know is all wrong

I hope you know
That you can trust me, baby, it's just me
I hope you know
That you don't owe me, oh girl, you own me
I hope you know
You're really special, you're so next level
I hope you know just how much I believe in you

It's quiet now
I doubt if any thoughts will ever come again
But there's a sense of some lone consequence
Wheezing down my neck
It's fine, we're fine
I'm doing everything that I'm supposed to do
I'd burn it all, I'd set the world on fire just to be with you
