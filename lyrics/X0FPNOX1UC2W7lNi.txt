And let me introduce you to a pair that strikes crude oil, but I see pyrite.
It is the same old pattern, the goose that feeds the gander.
They choose to act but not I.

Planting the seeds you sow,
Is easier than growing the row.
Let's go outside and it might restore us, whole.
More for the fire that fights for the freeze, now.
Mechanical.

So then the pair proceeded,
Another pulse defeated, can't say that I am surprised.
It is the fly trap's color that caused the fall into her.
What is the shade that you saw?

Planting the seeds you sow,
Is easier than growing the row.
Let's go outside and it might restore us, whole.
More for the fire that fights for the freeze, now.
Mechanical.

Bound by the salt, not your Earth,
The hat mocks the rabbit, while the bee stings the shark.
Stop the start, these are my disguises.

Planting the seeds you sow,
Is easier than growing the row.
Let's go outside and it might restore us, whole.
More for the fire that fights for the freeze, now.
Let's go outside and it might restore us,
