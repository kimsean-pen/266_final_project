I woke up in the middle of the night
Had a dream that I was still sleeping
But you were there holding me tight
On a bed in IKEA
We were playing house
We were playing house
We were playing house

Where are you? Where are you?
Find me please, baby
Where are you? Where are you?
Find me please
I can't go back to sleep without you

The lights turned off when I opened my eyes
Now my bed feels cold as ice
But it was warm just a moment ago
We were playing house like a couple of adults
I wanna sleep, I just wanna be asleep
And I don't care where, I just want you next to me
I'm sick of squeezing my pillow at night
Just take me back where we were playing house

Where are you? Where are you?
Find me please, baby (Baby, baby, baby)
Where are you? Where are you?
Find me please, I can't go back
Where are you? Where are you?
Find me please, baby (Baby, baby, baby)
Where are you? Where are you?
Find me please
I can't go back to sleep without you

Just a little more of that second floor
Show room girl, we've been over this before
Over

Where are you? Where are you?
Find me please, baby (Baby, baby, baby)
Where are you? Where are you?
Find me please, I can't go back
Where are you? Where are you?
Find me please, baby (Baby, baby, baby)
Where are you? Where are you?
Find me please
I can't go back to sleep without you
