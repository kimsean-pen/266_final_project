Times they are changing
And times they are moving
And everything I ever knew
Will never be the same

I lie awake in the same old way
But there's something in the air
And it's calling me in
I know I'll follow
I don't think about it anymore

As the summer ends I think of Alaska by it's heart
You imagine the seasons
Want you by my side
And I know this winter
Is going to be especially cold

Like the river
I roll along
Today I'm here
Tomorrow I'm gone

I saw a group of birds passing by
They were moving like a school of fish in the sky
I hold onto that moment and keep it close to me
Cause it's times like that that i feel so small
And I'm humbled
And I feel one with it all
And my roots dig deep
And my branches are so high

Like the river
I roll along
Today I'm here
Tomorrow I'm gone

Like the river
I roll, I roll along
Today I'm here
Tomorrow I'm gone

I've walked and I've walked
And I still have so far to tread
I just need to keep that flock of birds inside my head
And that fluttering inside my chest

Like the river
I roll along
Today I'm here
Tomorrow I'm gone

Like the river
I roll along
Today I'm here
Tomorrow I'm gone
