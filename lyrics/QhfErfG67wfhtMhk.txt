No no no this isn't happening,
So I drink myself into a state,
Wherever you bring love you bring conditions,
And so I drink to make you go away.

My fear is slipping away from me,
My lazy feeling filling my skin,
My doubts are slipping away from me,
My conscience keeps on saying move on,
Move on,
Move on,
Come on baby move on.

My bones have broke and left me shattered,
And my thoughts keep going off the rails,
Whenever you brought love you brought restrictions,
And so I drink to make you go away,

My fear is slipping away from me,
My lazy feeling filling my skin,
My doubts are slipping away from me,
My conscience keeps on saying move on,
Move on,
Move on,
Come on baby move on.

My fear is slipping away from me,
My lazy feeling filling my skin,
My doubts are slipping away from me,
My conscience keeps on saying move on,
Move on,
Move on,
Come on baby move on.

Move on,
Move on,
Move on,
Come on baby move on.

Move on,
Move on,
Move on,
Come on baby move on.
