I feel my hands numb
What's the point of us if you destroy all of that
Seven graves, seven marks you left on my skin
I've got a friend, but a friend is all that she is

She has her secrets
And I've mine, we're matched up when it comes to lies
Let me in, let me off when I've reddened eyes
Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised, it's not on you, it's on I and I
And I would laugh at all of it, if I was sure it wasn't mine
Something will break
Something will break, just not my heart and just not tonight

She has her secrets
And I've mine, we're matched up when it comes to lies

And I can't
Even feel
Any love
Anymore

You know this song
You know this song
You know this song

She has control now
Passing on, I reach out to you in song, passing on
Passing on, I reach out to you in song, passing on
Passing on, passing on
Passing on, passing on
Passing on, I reach out to you in song, passing on

You know this song, you know this song
You know this song, you know this song
You know this song, you know this song
