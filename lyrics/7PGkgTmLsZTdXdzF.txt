Hindered by sober restlessness
Submitting to the amber crutch
The theme in my aching prose
Fantasizing the sight of Manhattan; that pour of a bitter red being that escapes a thin frame
The rebirth of mutual love
The slipping on gloves to lay tenderly

"I'm dying."
- "Is it blissful?"
"It's like a dream."
- "I want to dream."
