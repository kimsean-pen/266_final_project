In bed, with, a laptop and your cat
Just both
But would you really care

Out there all the ugly people live
Work on
Pay taxes and procreate

It's horrid
Plough
Inside, we're safe
Out there, there crazy endless scares
(Come back to bed)
You forget, just how average, avarage is
When you, marathon Beverly Hills
Ooh
She's so, sweet

Inside, we're safe
Out there, there crazy endless scares
(Come back to bed)
Inside, you'll see
In here, we are hatters and march hares
(Come back to bed)
