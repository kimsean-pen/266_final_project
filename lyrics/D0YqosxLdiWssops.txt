Bang bang rock with the gang
Bang bang rock with the gang
Save me from myself before Im going down
My world went kind of crazy spinning roundnround

My bodys in a mess from head to toe
Got nothing to lose and nowhere to go
Bang bang rock with the gang
Bang bang rock with the gang

Im driving out of town just follow my heart
I think Im gonna be a rocknroll star
The girls would go mad Id give em all I can give
If I had a cheap guitar and one dirty riff

Jo Jo I got to go
Here comes another show
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail

Rocking night after night day after day
Theres plenty of love and no escape

Lifes screaming and rolling like a monster train
Destination to nowhere I wont be late
Jo Jo I got to go
Here comes another show
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Bang bang rock with the gang
Bang bang rock with the gang
Bang bang rock with the gang
Bang bang rock with the gang
