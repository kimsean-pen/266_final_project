Right in front of your eyes
Why can't you see me
Can't you read all the signs
Why can't you feel it

Give me love, just a little bit harder
Mine's beating to this drum
It hasn't even started
But I know that is love

'Cause I feel like I'm a million, million
Feel like I'm a million miles away
Feel like I'm a million, million
Feel like I'm a million miles away
When you touch my body
I go wait base, so high for me to reach
Feel like I'm a million, million
Feel like I'm a million miles away

Feels like I'm going crazy
Cause I'm always craving your touch
My day dreams are amazing
Oh, boy, you're never too much

Give me love, just a little bit harder
Mine's beating to this drum
It hasn't even started
But I know that is love

'Cause I feel like I'm a million, million
Feel like I'm a million miles away
Feel like I'm a million, million
Feel like I'm a million miles away
When you touch my body
I go wait base, so high for me to reach
Feel like I'm a million, million
Feel like I'm a million miles away
