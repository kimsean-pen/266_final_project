Daylight fades away, and you're looking for an escape from everything
Follow my voice, and I'll serenade you through your darkest nights
Weakness takes its toll- I hope you know that you're not alone in suffering
When you are blue, I will be there for you

I know this hurts, we all hurt sometimes
Just know this will all subside- I won't let you lose control again

Daylight fades away, and temptation grows ever strong inside of you
You are so good, just know that mistakes don't define a man
Trust can feel so wrong. someday you'll trust that I'm here to stay, please take your time
Nothing is real but I still believe in you
Push me away... when you love someone, you love them patiently, and I won't let you slip away from me

Close your eyes, don't be afraid of it, we're all waiting from the other side
Under my spell, you will find the strength to leave your fears behind
I've got this light to give
You and me, we could fall asleep and wake up to a new sunrise
