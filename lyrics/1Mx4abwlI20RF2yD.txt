I should be getting my things
We both know what that means
Can we slow this down?
No, I'm not ready now
Every time I go away
Your jumper's safe in my case
Like it always is
One thing less to miss

And I know this is a good time
Got my car and it's waiting outside but
I don't wanna think about it

'Cause right now I'm all yours
So kiss me like you're tryna hold on
20 more minutes, I'm out the door
So gimme one more, gimme one more
Won't forget this
I'm gonna leave you so breathless
Feels like forever 'cause then I'm gone
So gimme one more
Gimme one more goodbye

Bye
Bye
Bye
Gimme one more
Gimme one more goodbye

I'll call you when I've landed
Lying in my hotel bed
And I'm all alone
Wishing I was home
I know the days will fly by
I'll be back in a blink of an eye
Like you always say
Nothing's gonna change

And I know this is a good time
Got my car and it's waiting outside but
I don't wanna think about it

'Cause right now I'm all yours
So kiss me like you're tryna hold on
20 more minutes, I'm out the door
So gimme one more, gimme one more
Won't forget this
I'm gonna leave you so breathless
Feels like forever 'cause then I'm gone
So gimme one more, gimme

One more kiss is not enough
One more second of our love
Is all I need before I leave
'Cause I don't wanna think about it, no

'Cause right now I'm all yours
So kiss me like you're tryna hold on
20 more minutes, I'm out the door
So gimme one more, gimme one more
Won't forget this
I'm gonna leave you so breathless
Feels like forever 'cause then I'm gone
So gimme one more
Gimme one more goodbye

Bye
Bye
Bye
Gimme one more, gimme one more goodbye
Bye
Bye
Bye
Gimme one more, gimme one more goodbye
