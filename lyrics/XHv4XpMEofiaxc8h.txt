From the size of her eyes, I can see
She doesn't miss a beat
See I'd live in a tent on the street
To have you here with me

If I could fly me to the moon
I'd do so in an instant
If I never made the distance
I know you'd wait for me
And if I flew you up to heaven
It would be my pleasure
Steal away the treasure
Set you free

Settin' off a chain reaction
Stone cold attraction
Soul satisfaction

From the size of her smiles I can see
She doesn't miss a beat
See I'd live in a box in the sea
To have you here with me

If I could fly me to the moon
I'd do so in an instant
If I never made the distance
I know you'd wait for me
And if I flew you up to heaven
It would be my pleasure
Steal away the treasure
Set you free

Settin' off a chain reaction
Stone cold attraction
Soul satisfaction
Settin' off a chain reaction
Stone cold attraction
Soul satisfaction

If I could fly me to the moon
I'd do so in an instant
If I never made the distance
I know you'd wait me
And if I flew you up to heaven
It would be my pleasure
Steal away the treasure
Set you free

If I could fly me to the moon
I'd do so in an instant
If I never made the distance
I know you'd wait me
And if I flew you up to heaven
It would be my pleasure
Steal away the treasure
Set you free

Settin' off a chain reaction
Stone cold attraction
Soul satisfaction
Settin' off a chain reaction
Stone cold attraction
Soul satisfaction

That's what I need
To be guaranteed
Soul satisfaction
