Shouldn't have trusted in a fuckboy, oh oh
Know you never needed help
So if you got a problem, it's on yourself
Never thought you'd fall on your way to hell
Shouldn't have trusted in a fuckboy, oh oh
Know you never needed help
So if you got a problem, it's on yourself
Never thought you'd fall on your way to hell

Tell me, tell me, can you show me
How you burned me like a flame
So when you see me hope you know that
I could never feel the same
Cuz as the day's progressin by
My blood still runnin through my veins
Reminds me that I'm still alive
Although, I feel like I'm enslaved
Society can press me down but Imma press that fucka back
I tell you humans, leave me alone
I'm on the edge, I might attack
I face the demons deep inside me
And I put 'em on my back
So when you see me hope you know
Its not just me who did it

Shouldn't have trusted in a fuckboy, oh oh
Know you never needed help
So if you got a problem, it's on yourself
Never thought you'd fall on your way to hell
Shouldn't have trusted in a fuckboy, oh oh
Know you never needed help
So if you got a problem, it's on yourself
Never thought you'd fall on your way to hell
