Once upon a time
They called me the bleeder
Swimming up this river
With sentimental fever
But this ain't my first ride

It ain't my last try
Just got to keep moving on
If they catch me ever
They'll throw me back forever
I guess I should be ashamed
But I forget to be vain

I did the best I could I guess
But everything just bleeds
They say you're only sad and lonely
And no one is impressed
I sent it off in a letter

I'll need something better
Than a nail and a hammer
To put me back together
But this ain't my first ride
It ain't my last try
Just got to keep moving on

Gotta keep this together
Maybe next time is never
I guess I should be ashamed
But I forget to be vain

I did the best I could I guess
But everything just bleeds
They say you're only sad and lonely
And no one is impressed

Sometimes I must confess
I do feel a little overdressed
Sometimes it's hard to tell the wishing from the well
Where you threw the penny
And where it fell
I guess I should be ashamed
But I forget to be vain
I did the best I could I guess
But everything just bleeds
I guess I should be ashamed
But I forget to be vain
I did the best I could I guess
But everything just bleeds
They say you're only sad and lonely
And no one is impressed
