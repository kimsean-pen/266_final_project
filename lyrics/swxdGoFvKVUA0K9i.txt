I can't breathe through the smoke in my lungs
You can't see things the way I do
I waste time the way I worry about you
You can't lie 'cuz I can tell when you do

Tell me what you want from me, my girl
Hurry baby, I don't wanna let you down
I can take you anywhere you want in the world
I've come so far can't look back now

Everybody loves to see me down
Now I'm getting money, hoes coming around
I spend my money but I'm making it back
Want to step inside a building, burn shit to the ground

Tell me if you feel unsafe
'Cuz I will be there no matter where you stay
And I will die for you no matter what you say
'Cuz you're the one for me, no you're the one for me

The one for me, you're the one for me
One for me, you're the one for me

I can't breathe through the smoke in my lungs
You can't see things the way I do
I waste time the way I worry about you
You can't lie 'cuz I can tell when you do

Tell me what you want from me, my girl
Hurry baby, I don't wanna let you down
I can take you anywhere you want in the world
I've come so far can't look back now

Everybody loves to see me down
Now I'm getting money, hoes coming around
I spend my money but I'm making it back
Want to step inside a building, burn shit to the ground
