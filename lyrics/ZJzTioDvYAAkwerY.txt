Oh that song your singing
Singing into me
Over everything
I used to be

Oh that song that your singing
Singing into me
Slow and sweet

It carries me
carries me
carries me
Out to sea
And swallows me
Into the deep

and comfort me
and comfort me

Oh that weight
is lifting
lifting off me
it carries me
out to sea
and swallows me

and swallows me
and swallows me
Yeah
Into the deep
and comfort me
and comfort me
in
into the deep
and comfort me
and comfort me
and comfort me

(ends with humming)

Breath unto me
Breath unto me
Breath it into me
Breathe out into me
Breathe into me
oh breathe out
though me
why don't you breathe into me
