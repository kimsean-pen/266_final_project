I've been walking over graves
Carving out the headstone
That I own
My own
I'm like a monster in a cage
Traped inside a maze
I am home
I'm home
I'm here and gone
I'm dead and done
I know
There's nothing I can change
(Digging my own)
And I regret
(Digging my own)
The things I didn't say
I resent
How I walked away
(Digging my own)
Now I'm digging my own grave
(Digging my own)
Now I'm digging my own
Digging my own grave
Is there peace beyond the rage
Tell me where it's truly
All went wrong
Went wrong
I've been walking through the graves
Dancing with the lonely
And the strong
The strong
I'm here and gone
I'm dead and done
I know
There's nothing I can change
(Digging my own)
And I regret
(Digging my own)
The things I didn't say
I resent
How I walked away
(Digging my own)
Now I'm digging my own grave
(Digging my own)
Now I'm digging my own
Digging my own grave
Digging my
Digging my
Grave
I know
There's nothing I can change
(Digging my own)
And I regret
(Digging my own)
The things I didn't say
(Digging my, Digging my grave)
I resent
How I walked away
(Digging my own)
Now I'm digging my own grave
(Digging my own)
Now I'm digging my own
Digging my own grave
Is there peace beyond the rage
Cause ive been digging my own
Digging my own
Grave
