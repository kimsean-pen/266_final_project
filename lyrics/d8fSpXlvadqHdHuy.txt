You got secrets to unfold
You got stories never told
You're holding information

Standing right in front of me
A hidden rhapsody
I walk into temptation

Something tells me we can make some music
The rhythm is drivin' me wild
And something tells me we ain't gonna loose it
Keep pushin' way into the night

Number one, keep rollin'
Say you're real, I'm hopin'
Do you feel the way I do

Bring it on, it's magic
Are you real, fantastic
Say you feel the way I do

Number two, keep turnin'
Feel the heat, we're burnin'
I'll do anything for you

We can be forever
Number one, together
We can make a dream come true

Well I guess it's up to you
Do you feel the way I do
When bodytalk is magic

So is this my lucky day
Will you stay or walk away
Right now you're stoppin' traffic

Something tells me we can make some music
The rhythm is drivin' me wild
And something tells me we ain't gonna loose it
Keep pushin' way into the night

Number one, keep rollin'
Say you're real, I'm hopin'
Do you feel the way I do

Bring it on, it's magic
Are you real, fantastic
Say you feel the way I do

Number two, keep turnin'
Feel the heat, we're burnin'
I'll do anything for you

We can be forever
Number one, together
We can make a dream come true
