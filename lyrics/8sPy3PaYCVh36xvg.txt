Came to the door but she wouldn't see me
So I turned away to leave
She leaned out the window and said, "Where you goin'?"
Now I have no time to grieve

And as I pushed my foot to the pedal
I was driving much too fast
The rain comin' down and I couldn't see much
Now I have no time to grieve

And now you're right all the time
And I'm just oblivious
I'd rather stay in bed with you
Till it's time to get a drink
