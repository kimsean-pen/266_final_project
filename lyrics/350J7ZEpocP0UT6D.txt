Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered around the party talkin'
That's when Billy would take me walkin'
Through the back yard we'd go walkin'
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows to my surprise

The only one who could ever reach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
The only boy who could ever teach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
Yes he was, yeah he was, oh he was, hey
(Halleluiah, halleluiah, halleluiah)

Bein' good isn't always easy
No matter how hard the try
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
He'd kiss and tell me "Everything is all right"
Baby, baby everything is all right
Can I sneak away again tonight now?

The only one who could ever reach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
I tell you that the only boy who could ever teach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
Yes he was, yeah he was, oh he was
(Halleluiah, halleluiah, halleluiah)

How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all of mine now
Learnin' from each other's knowin'
Lookin' to see how much we've grown and

The only boy who could ever reach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
I tell you that the only boy who could ever teach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
Yes he was, yeah he was, oh he was, halleluiah
(Halleluiah, halleluiah, halleluiah)

Halleluiah
(Son of a preacher boy, halleluiah)
Halleluiah
(Son of a preacher boy, halleluiah)
Halleluiah
(Son of a preacher boy, halleluiah)
Halleluiah
(Son of a preacher boy, halleluiah)
He is the only boy, yes he is, who could ever reach me
(Son of a preacher boy)
He is the only boy who could teach me
(Son of a preacher boy)
