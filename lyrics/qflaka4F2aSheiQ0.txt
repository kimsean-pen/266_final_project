I looked at you, girl,
I saw a smile.
For my love you said
you'd walk a mile.
Today I see your face,
you wear a frown.
Now you're tellin' me
that I'm a clown.

What's the reason for this sudden change?
I never thought that you would act so strange.

You say that I'm a bore
and we should part
so you can go and
make a brand new start.
You laughed and me and then
I almost cried.

You hurt my heart so bad
I had to hide.

What's the reason for this sudden change?
I never thought that you would act so strange.

I'm gettin' tired of listenin'
to you talk.
I think I'll go outside
and take a walk.
Took my guitar and
got up off the floor.
I must have dozed off while
while you were next door.

My mind's at ease that I know you're on my side.
That ice cold daydream took me for an ugly ride.
