Can you imagine? Me?
The wife of that boorish, brainless...
Madame Gaston!

Can't you just see it?
Madame Gaston!
His little wife!
No sir, not me
I guarantee it

I want much more than this provincial life
I want adventure in the great wide somewhere
I want it more than I can tell
And for once it might be grand
To have someone understand
I want so much more
Than they've got planned
