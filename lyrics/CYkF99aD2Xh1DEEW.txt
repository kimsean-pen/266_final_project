Rainbow child, I used to call her name a lot when love was doing well
We have start to call of you away from me but most of all yourself
Got what you're looking for, waving bye to the poor
Got what you're gazing at, understanding and respect
Oh Rosie, got it made, got it made, got it made, got it made
Oh yeah Rosie, got it made, got it made, got it made, got it made
Rainbow star, oh you fly too high, above our heads just held by a string
Look how Rose cause the fall is coming, your shadow tells the state you're in
Got what you're looking for, waving bye to the poor
Got what you're gazing at, understanding and respect
Oh Rosie, got it made, got it made, got it made, got it made
Oh yeah Rosie, got it made, got it made, got it made, got it made
Got what you're looking for, waving bye to the poor
Tell me, girl, what is it like to be a goddess overnight, yeah
What do you fear the most: suicide or local dope
Oh Rosie, got it made, got it made, got it made, got it made
Oh Rosie, got it made, got it made, got it made, got it made
Oh Rosie, got it made, got it made, got it made, got it made
Oh Rosie, got it made, got it made, got it made, got it made
Oh yeah Rosie, got it made, got it made, got it made, got it made
