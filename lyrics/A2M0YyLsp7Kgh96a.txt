I know I was a fool when I first met you girl
But once I was a danger to myself
But one look at you and all that was changed girl
I knew in my heart I'd been saved

Because I Iove to love you
You got me tied down my honey bee
And yes I love to love you the way that I do
You were always on my mind
So I say it one more time
I love you
I love you

Once I thought that life was just a wasteland
Friends and power were all I craved
One look at you and I was changed, girl
I know in my heart I had been saved

Because I love to love you
You got me tied down my honey bee
And yes I love to love you the way I do
You were always on my mind
So I say it one more time
I love you
I love you
