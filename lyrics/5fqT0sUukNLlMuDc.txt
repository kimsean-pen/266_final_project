Feathered to the tips
Lightweight but strong
I can only go this long
Iron, steam and smoke
Your power is endless
I'm only flesh and bone
Airing machine holds a promise to break
Stuck in the dream that I may not escape

I pray for hurricanes
You take off when I want to stay
Out of steam I'm off terrain
I'm a bird in an aeroplane

Crossing continents
We're going in loops
Tell me, will we ever land?
Longing to return
To somewhere I've known
Something quite familiar
Airing machine holds a promise to break
Stuck in the dream that I may not escape

I pray for hurricanes
You take off when I want to stay
Out of steam I'm off terrain
I'm a bird in an aeroplane

We're flying over mountains
Higher every day
I'm trying to keep up
Trying to match your game
While you are gaining height
I'm fading into grey
And away

I pray for hurricanes
You take off when I want to stay
Out of steam I'm off terrain
I'm a bird in an aeroplane
