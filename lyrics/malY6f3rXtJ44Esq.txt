Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
It's a mind-body problem will we solve it in time?
And everybody, oh they think that you're fine
But I know there's a problem, press your body to mine (Ooh)
Well I know there's a problem, press your body to mine
Know there's a problem, press your body to mine

I don't know nothin' 'bout the heart and the soul
The mind and body, ooh, and what they control
And can't help it well my mind knows it's true
My body's calling when I'm next to you it's sayin'

Oooh, ooh, when I'm next to you it's sayin'
Oooh, ooh, when I'm next to you it's sayin'
Oooh, ooh, when I'm next to you it's sayin'
Oooh, when I'm next to you

All these ideas of you inside of my head
Not even touchin' you, just thinkin' instead
All these ideas of you my body don't know
But it responds as if it knew them before
It's sayin'

Oooh, ooh, as if it knew, it's sayin'
Oooh, ooh, as if it knew, it's sayin'
Oooh, ooh, as if it knew, it's sayin'
Oooh, as if it knew

I don't know nothin' 'bout the heart and the soul
The mind and body, and what they control
And can't help it well my mind knows it's true
My body's calling when I'm next to you it's sayin'

Oooh, ooh, when I'm next to you it's sayin'
Ooh, ooh, when I'm next to you it's sayin'
I know when I'm next to you it's sayin'
I know when I'm next to you
Oooh, ooh, when you do what you do, I'm sayin'
I do what you do, I'm sayin'
When I'm next to you I'm sayin'
When I'm next to you

Mind-body problem, can we solve it in time?
Mind-body problem, now won't you be mine?

Mind-body problem, now won't you be mine?
Now won't you be mine?
Now won't you be mine?
Mind-body problem, can we solve it in time?
