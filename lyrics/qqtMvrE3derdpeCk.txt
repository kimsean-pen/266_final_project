Break through the thunder night
When the lightning strikes
Fear the sign of the Dragonhead

We rush through foaming waves
Halvdan's firstborn, hail our King

Men of might, wolf-heathens cry!

Tempting the ocean wide
Highborn Leige Lord of Northern men

Land in sight
Berserks, sharpen knives!
(Draken, sea attack!)

Break through the thunder night
When the lightning strikes
Fear the Sign of the Dragonhead
Our ships will ride to the edge of the world
Thunder night, when the lightning strikes
Fear the Sign of the Dragonhead
The Draken will ride to the end of the world

Hollow serpent reddish ribs
A Dragon proud with reddened shields

Men of might, wolf-heathens cry!

Ship's keel obeys the mast
We dash the waves and gain land fast

Land in sight
Berserks sharpen knives!
(Draken, sea attack!)

Break through the thunder night
When the lightning strikes
Fear the Sign of the Dragonhead
Our ships will ride to the edge of the world
Thunder night, when the lightning strikes
Fear the Sign of the Dragonhead
The Draken will ride to the end of the world

(Tarred oar blades clash the water
Sons of Odin reach the stores
Wolf-coats of the Norse noard-warder
With bloody shields)

Sign of the Dragonhead...

Break through the thunder night
When the lightning strikes
Fear the Sign of the Dragonhead
Our ships will ride to the edge of the world
Thunder night, when the lightning strikes
Fear the Sign of the Dragonhead
The Draken will ride to the end of the world

Sign of the Dragonhead
The Draken will ride

Break through the thunder night
When the lightning strikes
Fear the Sign of the Dragonhead
The Draken will ride!!
