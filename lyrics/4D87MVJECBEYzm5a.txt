Take it from me
All of what I know
Lay there beside me and show your warmth

Its hard to find peace
Buried in so deep
I can only hear the world is shouting

All I see is how I could change it all
Find my peace, love I feel its time to fall
For a new day, oh from silence
To a new state of mind

Heard a whisper
Something said so sweet
Now quiet as ever, we'll leave this scene

Show no fear
For things we can't control
Hoping that you see how great that feels

All I see is how I could change it all
Find my peace, love I feel its time to fall
For a new day, oh from silence
To a new state of mind

All I see is how I could change it all
Find my peace, love I feel its time to fall
For a new day, oh from silence
To a new state of mind
