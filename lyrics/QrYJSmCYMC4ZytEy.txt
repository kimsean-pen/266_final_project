No you're not really that small, I just said it so I'd hurt you
Da dum dum

I know I said that I'd call, but I never said when

Always holdin' over your head, everything we've been through
Da dum dum

I wish I could be that tender stable girl that you want, but I'm not
Da dum dum

So can I cut you some slack
Get all that weight off your back, aha
Lift the tension in the air
That I put there, that I put there
So let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you, aha
Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you, aha
Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you, aha
However, whenever, whatever you want me to
No I don't have to go home, I just love to make you anxious

How you always ruin good things, like that time with your friends
Da dum dum
Da dum dum
And I'm probably ruining something
now when I can't believe you're staying

Da dum dum
I wish I could be that tender stable girl that you want, but I'm not
Da dum dum
Da dum dum
So can I help you relax
Get all that weight off your back, aha
Eliminate the unfair
That I put there, that I put there, oh
Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you, aha
Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you, aha
Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you, aha
However, whenever, whatever you want me to
And if it ain't enough, ain't enough,
ain't enough, ain't enough for you, aha
The hurt is so deep,
it's making you think things that aren't true, aha
Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you, aha
However, whenever, whatever you want me to
I could apologise, but that's not my style
I could just write it out, but that takes some time
So let me communicate the only way that I know how
I wish I could be that tender stable girl that you want, but I'm not
And I'm not so
Ah, let me make it up, make it up,
make it up, make it up to you (make it up to you)
Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you, aha
Let me make it up, make it up, make it up, make it up to you, aha
However, whenever, whatever (you only want me to)
And if it ain't enough, ain't enough,
ain't enough, ain't enough for you (for you), aha
The hurt is so deep, it's making you think things that aren't true,
aha Let me make it up, make it up,
make it up, make it up to you (baby)
However, whenever, whatever you want me to
