I took a bullet for you
But it was you who pull the trigger
Silence grew, but the pain dug deeper
You push the knife in
It is you who acts like you bleed
I don't know you
I don't know you at all
I don't know you
I don't know you at all I was lost I didn't know myself
You were in love with someone else
I don't know you at all
Don't touch my heart with your dirty hands
Oh losing you was my biggest
Oh my biggest win
You push the knife in
It's you who acts like you bleed
I don't know you
I don't know you at all
I don't know you
I don't know you at all I was lost I didn't know myself
You were in love with someone else
I don't know you at all Oh at all
I don't know you
I don't know you at all I don't know you
I've been lost so many times
I was lost I didn't know myself
You were in love with someone else
I don't know you at all I don't know you
I don't know you at all I was lost I didn't know myself
You were in love with someone
I don't know you at all
