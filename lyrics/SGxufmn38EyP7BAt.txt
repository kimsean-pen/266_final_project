Slow train
Don't you know my pain
Swim through my veins
On a slow train

I am lost all around
I am barely on the ground
Around the bed comes a slow train
Train

Release the fire out of me
I don't wanna burn from the inside
And I don't know my name
And I don't know my purpose
I just know my place on the slow train

Standing on the platform, waiting for that train
Son, you are too late now, train already came
Waiting out the rain now, waiting for that sun
I'm waiting on a train that's already gone
Gone

Release the fire out of me
I don't wanna burn from the inside
And I don't know my name
And I don't know my purpose
I just know my place on the slow train

A slow train coming, a slow train gone
A slow train coming, a slow train gone
A slow train coming, a slow train gone
A slow train coming, a slow train gone
