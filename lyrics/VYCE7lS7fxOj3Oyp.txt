The things my father said
Would make me a better man
Hard work and the love of friends
A woman that understands
I hope my father knows
The seeds we've sown, still grow
At night I go to sleep and
Pray he is watching over me

Somewhere there's a star
That's shining so bright
That I can see you smile
And all that I need is one last chance
Just to hear you say goodbye

Sometimes I remember when
You taught me to tie my shoes
One thing I will never forget
Is the day that I lost you
I hope you always know
That car that we built
Will always roll

Somewhere there's a star
That's shining so bright
That I can see you smile
And all that I need is one last chance
Just to hear you say goodbye

And if you have a dream
You better hang on for dear life
And when the cold wind blows
Just let it pass you by

Yeah, things my father said
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Somewhere there's a star
That's shining so bright
That I can see you smile
And all that I need is one last chance
Just to hear you say

-Solo-

{under solo}
Goodbye
Goodbye
Just to hear you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
