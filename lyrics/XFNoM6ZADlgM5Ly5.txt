You've always been chasing something distant, yeah
Every time it slipped out of your hands
Well, you've always had the idea you're something different
But you're the wannabe who wants to be something
It's time for you to change, you gotta go all in

I'm a wannabe, but I wanna be something
It's time for me to change, I gotta go all in
Set my alarm for early morning
Ring, ring ding, ding, ding, let's start working
Oh my brother, we almost have it
Yeah, it's so crazy good, can you taste it?

Space sushi
Space sushi, on the table
Space sushi, get to work, yeah
Space sushi

It's so freakin' easy to get wasted, yeah
We've been through this way too many times
If we wanna be top, we need to stop this
'Cause we're the wannabes who want to be something
It's time for you to change you gotta go all in

I'm a wannabe, but I wanna be something
It's time for me to change, I gotta go all in
Set my alarm for early morning
Ring, ring ding, ding, ding, let's start working
Never let it rest, constant forging
This is everything you've been wanting
Oh my brother, we almost have it
It's so crazy good, can you taste it?

Space sushi
Space sushi, on the table
Space sushi, get to work, yeah
Space sushi

A week, a month, a year
I know that it's near, yeah
Right around the corner
This isn't just a dream
As hard as it seems
Remember that I told you
My eyes are bigger than my belly
And I will keep them that way
Be humble, don't mumble
For there will be a day
When my eyes won't be big enough

Space sushi
Space sushi, on the table
Space sushi, get to work, yeah
Space sushi
