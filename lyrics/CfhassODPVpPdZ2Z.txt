It was a night, oh, what a night
It was, it really was such a night
Oh, the moon was bright, oh, how bright
It was, it really was such a night
Oh, the night was alight with stars above
Mmh, when she kissed me
I had to fall in love

Mmh, it was a kiss, ooh, it was a kiss
It was, it really was such a kiss
Oh, how she could kiss, oh, what a kiss
It was, it really was such a kiss
Just the thought of her lips set me afire
I reminisce, I'm filled with desire

But I'd gave my heart to her in sweet surrender
How well I remember
I'll always remember

Oh, what a night, oh, what a night
It was, it really was such a night
Came the dawn and my heart and her love
And the night was gone
But I'll never forget
Forget the kiss in the moonlight
Oh, such a kiss
Oh, such a night

Oh, what a night, oh, what a night
It was, it really was such a night
Oh, the moon was bright, oh, how bright
It was, it really was such a night
But I'll never forget
Forget the kiss in the moonlight
How well I remember
I'lll always remember

But I'd gave my heart to her in sweet surrender
How well I remember, I'll always remember
Oh. that night, oh, what a night
It was, it really was such a night
And when we kissed
I had to fall in love

Well she's gone, gone, gone
Yes she's gone, gone, gone
And the dawn, dawn, dawn
And my love was gone
But before that dawn
Yes before that dawn
Ooh, before that dawn
Ooh, mmh, oh
Oh, such a night
