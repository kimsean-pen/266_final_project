It's something deep inside

First time that it crossed my mind
Kept on pushing it inside
It's such a strong emotion
Second time was plain to see
This feeling's rushing over me
Oh yeah

And unknown to me
This chemistry
Is something deep inside

Can feel but I can't touch
Can never get too much
I hear you loud and clear
I've got nothing to fear
Your love will be my guide
I've never been this satisfied
It's something deep inside

Third time was just as sweet
Boy, you make my life complete
Every thought and motion
It's hard just telling you
Everything I feel is true
Oh yeah

And unknown to me
This chemistry
Is something deep inside

Can feel but I can't touch
Can never get too much
I hear you loud and clear
I've got nothing to fear
Your love will be my guide
I've never been this satisfied
It's something deep inside

Deep inside

You do the things
That make me feel this way
It's so hard to find
The right things to say

But follow emotion
The love and devotion, you'll find
Something deep inside

Can feel but I can't touch
Can never get too much
I hear you loud and clear
I've got nothing to fear
Your love will be my guide
I've never been this satisfied
It's something deep inside

Can feel but I can't touch
Can never get too much
I hear you loud and clear
I've got nothing to fear
Your love will be my guide
I've never been this satisfied
It's something deep inside

Can feel but I can't touch
Can never get too much
I hear you loud and clear
I've got nothing to fear
Your love will be my guide
I've never been this satisfied
It's something deep inside

Can feel but I can't touch
Can never get too much
I hear you loud and clear
I've got nothing to fear
Your love will be my guide
I've never been this satisfied...
