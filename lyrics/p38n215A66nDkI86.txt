You're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong, never
No, you're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong, never wrong

You're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong, never
No, you're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong, never wrong

You're "never ever wrong"
Always something more to say
You're never wrong
Well you never mind, I'll be fine
You're never wrong
And there's nothing more to say
You're never wrong
It' s gonna end this time

You're "never wrong"
You can never be contained
You're never wrong
Well you never mind, I'll be fine
You are never wrong
Don't even bother to explain
You're never wrong
You'll never win this time

Feel the anger coming
Fell my patience running
Well it's plain to see that
You have lost your damn mind

How could you let it end up this way
Is there really nothing more you can say
I'm not taking another fucking dose of your denial today
I'm not willing to deal with someone
Who insists that they can never be wrong
So just keep on talking to the wall
Because I'm walking away

You're never ever wrong
And you never will believe
That you were wrong
You'll just never mind. And be fine
You're never wrong?
Are you really that deceived?
The illusion has to end this time
Well you were wrong
I know it's difficult to see
That you were wrong
In your little mind, every time
Yeah you were wrong
And now you'd better believe
The game is coming to an end this time

Feel the anger coming
Fell my patience running
And it's easy to see you've made me lose my damn mind!

How could you let it end up this way
Is there really nothing more you can say
I'm not taking another fucking dose of your denial today
I'm not willing to deal with someone
Who insists that they can never be wrong
So just keep on talking to the wall
Because I'm walking away

If you shut your mouth
Then we just might make it
You want a fight, be careful
What you're wishing for
So say it again, push it again
There is no coming back this time

Shut your mouth,
'Cause I just can't take it
I'm ready to fight
Is it all that you were hoping for
Don't say it again, do it again
There'll be no coming back this time

How could you let it end up this way
Is there really nothing more you can say
I'm not taking another fucking dose of your denial today
I'm not willing to deal with someone
Who insists that they can never be wrong
So just keep on talking to the wall
Because I'm walking away

How could you let it end up this way
Is there really nothing more you can say
I'm not taking another fucking dose of your denial today
I'm not willing to deal with someone
Who insists that they can never be wrong
So just keep on talking to the wall
Because I'm walking away

You're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong, never wrong
You're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong, never wrong
