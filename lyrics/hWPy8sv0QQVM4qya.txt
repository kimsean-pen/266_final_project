And I will stroll the merry way
And jump the hedges first
And I will drink the clear
Clean water for to quench my thirst
And I shall watch the ferry-boats
And they'll get high
On a bluer ocean
Against tomorrow's sky
And I will never grow so old again
And I will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain

Ohhoow sweet thing, sweet thing, hey yeah
My, my, my, my, my sweet thing

And I shall drive my chariot down your streets and cry
"Hey, it's me, I'm dynamite and I don't know why"
And you shall take me strongly in your arms again
And I will not remember that I even felt the pain
We shall walk and talk in gardens all misty and wet with rain
And I will never, never, never grow so old again

Ohhooow sweet thing, sweet thing, oohoow sweet thing
My, my, my, my, my sweet thing

And I will raise my hand up into the nighttime sky
And count the stars that's shining in your eye
And just to dig it all an' not to wonder, that's just fine
And I'll be satisfied not to read in between the lines
And I will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain
And I will never, ever, ever, ever grow so old again

Ohoow sweet thing, ohoow sugar baby, sweet thing
Sugar-baby with your champagne eyes
And your saint-like smile
