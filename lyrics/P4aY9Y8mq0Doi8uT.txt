Can't you see a sign from God he came to me
Maybe something to believe, is all our people really need
Have you lost your love, look in their eyes they've given up
Watch as all our homes are burned
Salvation a far cry which I will return

Take a look around how we've fallen from grace
I am the hand to liberate them

Heresy defeats the uncrowned king a saviour
Peasant girl holds high the Fleur De lis
In the fire she burns with spirit high
For all eternity lives on her memory

Follow me on to reclaim the rightful king
We rise again and fight for him, for God has spoken to me
You must keep hope this land we walk upon is our home
This kingdom is now a shadow of its past
And I condemn this game for thrones

Take a look around all they needed was faith
And now our souls have all awakened

Heresy defeats the uncrowned king a saviour
Peasant girl holds high the Fleur De lis
In the fire she burns with spirit high
For all eternity lives on her memory

Fight with me, hold up high the Fleur de lis
Our future has us on our knees
So bury all these memories
Fight with me

Die for what is yours, to be free again
One last time, fight with me

Heresy defeats the uncrowned king a saviour
Peasant girl holds high the Fleur De lis
In the fire she burns with spirit high
For all eternity lives on her memory
