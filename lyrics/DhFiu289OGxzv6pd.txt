When summer's gone flee my angel
Winterwinds they might lead you far away
Beyond the pale horizon, a greaven silence
Over dreams to my heart yet not remain

(Vibeke) Oh please believe
It's in her eyes
(Vibeke) It is inside
It's in her heart, the same relation from which
I once led astray
(Vibeke) Oh please believe
It's in her eyes
(Vibeke) It is inside
It's in her heart, the same delightful place
I once felt in you

Angellore revered at dusk
For thee I rose, now descend all alone
Rise for me, soothe my heart
So wide a sea, may I overcome

(Spoken) Into the night strays an angel
So lost and tearful all astray

Into the night strays an angel
So lost and tearful all astray
Lo where's the pale horizon
Oh where there's dyingness
You reach for me beyond so wide a sea

(Vibeke) Oh please believe
It's in her eyes
(Vibeke) It is inside
It's in her heart, the same desire
I feel burning in me
(Vibeke) Oh please believe
It's in her eyes
(Vibeke) It is inside
It's in her heart, the same desire from
The empty pain within

Rise for me, soothe my heart
So wide a sea, may I overcome

(Vibeke) Deep as the sea, wailing secrecies are burning in me
For a dream I once desired
I bequeth my sorrow and I regret to thee
Cannot cross that wide a sea

Angellore revered at dusk
For thee I rose, now descend all alone
Rise for me, soothe my heart
So wide a sea, may I overcome
