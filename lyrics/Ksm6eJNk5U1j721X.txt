Our life
Seems virtually occupied
By one soul
In two bodies tied
Our life
You make my feet come off the ground
Float above the world that's going round

Ah my love
You make my heart beat in its cage
And I hope
It will into old age

Our love
Makes my head walk in the clouds
Lost in time and space never coming down

This is not the first time we've seen change
Starting fresh and rearrange
Getting kind of used hanging onto our love
Its just another way to say I'm safe
