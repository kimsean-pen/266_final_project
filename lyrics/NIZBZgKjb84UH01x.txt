Flying over the ocean
Always makes me feel so alone
So alone

I remember looking out the window
And seeing nothing but blue and grey

Flying over the ocean
Always makes me feel so alone
So alone

I remember looking out the window
Thinking I can't, thinking about leaving

Flying over the ocean
Always makes me feel so alone
So alone

I remember looking out the window
Seeing nothing but blue and grey
