Gaze at the leaving clairvoyant
Predicting invasions and pain
A child can see through the stranger
The Watcher's eye, the noble liar

It's time for the merchant, and his help for sale
Blades to cut wicked flesh
On a merchantman he counts his money
Then he sails away
The sea he'll cruise is blood and fire

Oh father i can't see a lane
They make you a pawn in the game
For we are all deaf, dumb and blind

After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the Tears Of A Mandrake
Pawn in the game, invisible chains
Try to move, you'll feel as they graze

After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the Tears Of A Mandrake
Fading away, the final decay
Try to move, break out from your chains

When you're off to the hall of the serpent
See the cynic who's counting his gold
While gun runners, priests and clairvoyants
Are dancing around the rising demon

You are taught to eat up all the crap they shit
Parading your nuts on a silver plate
Kill your brother by the blade they sell
For you don't unite
They reap your bondage sowing evil

There's no use to tell what I've seen
They know how to make you believe
Just what they want you to know

After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the Tears Of A Mandrake
Pawn in the game, invisible chains
Try to move, you'll feel as they graze

After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the Tears Of A Mandrake
Fading away, the final decay
Try to move, break out from your chains

Tears of mandrake - yeah

After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the Tears Of A Mandrake
Pawn in the game, invisible chains
Try to move, you'll feel as they graze

After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the Tears Of A Mandrake
Fading away, the final decay
Try to move, break out from your chain

After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the Tears Of A Mandrake
Pawn in the game, invisible chains
Try to move, you'll feel as they graze

After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the Tears Of A Mandrake
Fading away, the final decay
Try to move, break out from your chain
