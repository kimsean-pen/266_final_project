Watch me now I'm vanishing in the light.
I photographed my latest meal in black and white.
I kept my faith in videos of cats in shoes.
And spent a day on episodes on plastic use.

Watch me now I'm vanishing in the light.
I'm filtering my losing streak warm and bright.
A history I've left behind, high on words
Of all the stupid things we said but never heard.

Straight to the extinction of your last company.
Go to the lost amber funeral echo in the hall.

Straight to the extinction, burn and moan.
Go to the lost amber carved in stone.
Filming the blue morning carefully.
Climbing the late hours. When will you see me?
