I get the feeling you don't feel me
Must be a reason you're still here
Is it the money or the freedom?
You've taken both but it's not clear

You're still untied, angry ocean
Celebrate the void
You never let me near your light
You're gonna need it if I leave

Take a chance
See where it takes me
Make a break
See if I break

Not that long ago, lit my doubt
Lotta wick then quick to blow
You gotta let me out

I can't climb your fathers wall
What you want from me?
I've no time for the long good bye
You gotta set me free

Free from feelings I don't feel
Free to say the void is real
No one's wrong and free to be
To demonstrate the space we need

Empty my-my
Celebrate the void
Empty my-my
Celebrate the void
Celebrate the void
Celebrate the void
