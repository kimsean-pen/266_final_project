I don t even care, if you re in my hand
You ve got something, show me what
So why should I care
You ve got what I want,
But I can t get to it
I keep my mind touched
Even mouth shut
Entice my love, entice my love
Searching days and feeling
Coasting through your love
Watch the running river stream
Till they call you love
Entice my love, entice my love

Entice my love, entice my love
Entice my love, entice my love
Entice my love, entice my love
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth.
