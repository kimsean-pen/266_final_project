Dream against the flow
Let your garden grow
Over land and water
Feel your borders

Walking right into the sun
Don't fear the ending
Find the beginning
Over another lonely star
Brigther than who you are

Walking right into the sun

All my sweetest doubts
Let them help you out
My emotion
Parted ocean

Walking right into the sun
Don't fear the ending
Find the beginning
Over another lonely star
Brighter than who you are
Walking right into the sun
