This is a poison everyone knows
It runs through my rivers.
created and cured by the same, and it will flow.

Tear through these holds, and rip away my heart.
with an effort so constrained, this is the venom in my veins.
This is the venom in my veins, created and cured by the same.
This is the venom in my veins. (I've spoken reckless words?)

And I know I've built a bed of unrest
that destroys my heart once I lay my head down.
Destroys the crutches that I've built,
I thought they were sound.

We are the reasons for health and light, for illness and weakness.
It will flow from my body to yours, an infection that can't be cured.

We are the reasons for health and light, for illness and weakness.
We will tear through these holds.
We will tear through these holds or we will keep them strong.
We are the reasons for health and light.
For illness and weakness, we will tear through these holds
or we will keep them strong
We will keep them strong.

With an effort so constrained, this is venom in my veins
created, cured by the same,
by the same.
I've chosen selfless over selfishness,
I've left a bed of disgust and unrest.

Destroyed the crutches that I built myself, I found that they were never sound.
It won't consume my heart anymore.

And I know I've built a bed of peace
that restores my heart once I lay my head down.
Rebuilds the crutches that I destroyed myself.

I plead to change my life, just before I dream
and wake to realize that change is inside me.

We are the reasons for health and light, for illness and weakness.
We will tear through these holds.
We will tear through these holds or we will keep them strong
We are the reasons for health and light.
