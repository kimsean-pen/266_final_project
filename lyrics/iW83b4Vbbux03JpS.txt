Hey-o here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started and we ain't gonna stop
We gonna turn it out till it gets too hot
Everybody sing, Hey-O
Tell'em turn it up till they can't no more
Lets get this thing shakin like a disco ball
This is your last warning, a courtesy call

We gonna turn it out till it gets too hot
Everybody sing, Hey-O

I am not afraid of the storm that comes my way
When it hits it shakes me to the core
And makes me stronger than before
It's not a question about trust
But will you stand with us
Can you feel it, make it real

I think it might wash away tonight
Awaken from this never ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting is not just rotting

There's a rumble in the floor
So get prepared for war
When it hits it'll knock you to the ground
When it shakes up everything around
But survival is a must
So will you stand with us
Can you feel it, make it real
Make me feel it

I think it might wash away tonight
Awaken from this never ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting is not just rotting
