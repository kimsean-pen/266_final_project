You came in a flash of light
And my soul went weightless
You're the perfect archetype
Raptured and captivated

Feel me heart begin to race
You take me to the place
That I've never known before
I hear the thunder roll
I hear the heavens call
I could never want it more

You are the spark, you set me on fire
You're so iconic, everything I wanted
You are my world, my legend, my star
You're so iconic, everybody wants it
You-ou-ou, intoxicate me
When you mo-o-ove
Look at the mess you make me
You are my world, my legend, my star
You're so iconic, everybody wants it

You came in a crash of bliss
It seems that fate has chained us
Embracing metamorphosis
As I give into your love

Oh, I hear you calling me
I can't help falling deep
Into your sweetness, your abyss
My heart begins to race
You take me to the place
I want it all and more of it

You are the spark, you set me on fire
You're so iconic, everything I wanted
You are my world, my legend, my star
You're so iconic, everybody wants it
You-ou-ou intoxicate me
When you mo-o-ove
Look at the mess you make me
You are my world, my legend, my star
You're so iconic, everybody wants it

Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
I hear the thunder roar
I hear the heavens come
I can never want it more

You-ou-ou intoxicate me
When you mo-o-ove
Look at the mess you make me
Look at the mess you make me
So iconic, everybody wants it

You are the spark, you set me on fire
You're so iconic, everything I wanted
You are my world, my legend, my star
You're so iconic, everybody wants it
You-ou-ou, intoxicate me
When you mo-o-ove
Look at the mess you make me
You are my world, my legend, my star
You're so iconic, everybody wants it
