Hey you, you're irreversible
Just like my friends, performing miracles
My name is meant to never cross your words
So leave me to be alone

All you say, all you say
Is everything you try to be
And all you know, all you know
Is nothing true of what you think of me

So don't talk now
You can think
You can't speak
So don't cry now
You're my friend in my head
But I don't know if you want to be

So settle down
I won't begin to leave
I've lost myself
In things I don't believe
And all this time I've been myself
To all of you

So don't talk now

So don't cry now
(Settle down)
You're my friend in my head
But I don't know if you want to be
