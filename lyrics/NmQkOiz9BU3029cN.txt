Hey, you're back again
I tried my best to pretend
That I was not waiting for your call
It was a pleasant surprise and that was all

So I got dressed up in my sunday best
But I wasn't prepared for the punch to my chest
When you walked in and I first saw your face
A familiar vision with a newfound grace

Then you ask how I've been
And I do the same
Though years have passed
It feels like nothing's changed

We all know nostalgia is toxic and dangerous
That it poisons the heart smothers and enslaves us

It's clear to the both of us
That something rare was lost
But what it is we can't define
These feelings though cloaked in dust
They never came to rust
Over the years and years of longing for you
'Cos your love took hold
A dead weight within my soul
