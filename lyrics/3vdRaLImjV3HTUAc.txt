Da da da da
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh baby girl I am here
I want to make sure that you live for me
Cause I'm crying in my sleep all night
And I'm rolling in my tears
And I'm drowning
I'm drowning

Yes, I've got your number
And your address too
And if I call you over
You'll bring it smiling with you

Yes, I'll be fine in the morning when you leave
I'll understand
Just let me see another smile
Da da da da
Oh Oh Oh
Tell me
How long have you been down?
Do your problems cause you to ... on the floor and crawl around?

Yes, I'll be fine in the morning when you leave
I'll understand
Just let me see one more smile
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
