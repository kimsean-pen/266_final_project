Be here a while, might as well smile
Might as well smile
I will be strong, will carry on
And I'll always hold on to my smile
What would you say?
Would you say that I'm sad for feeling this way, ah-ha-ha?
What would you do if you were in my shoes, in mine?

Do you know what I think?
Do you know what I think about it, 'bout it?
I guess you don't know anything
You don't know anything about it, 'bout it
Do you know what I think?
Do you know what I think about it, 'bout it?
I guess you don't know anything
You don't know anything about it, 'bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it

Dust in my eyes, I realise that I'm thinking of you
I'll take my car, I will go far and I'll be lonely for you
What would you say?
Would you say that I'm sad for feeling this way, ah-ha-ha?
What would you do if you were in my shoes, in mine?

Do you know what I think?
Do you know what I think about it, 'bout it?
I guess you don't know anything
You don't know anything about it, 'bout it
Do you know what I think?
Do you know what I think about it, 'bout it?
I guess you don't know anything
You don't know anything about it, 'bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it
