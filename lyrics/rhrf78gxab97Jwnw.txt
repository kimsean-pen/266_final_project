Is there anything more I can do for you
Should my hair be red, or shall it be blue
Is there anything more I can do for you
Shall I let the green grass turn black for you
Is there something more you want me to do
Shall I hand up all of my secrets to you
Maybe then you'll see me too
Is there something more
You got me on my knees saying please are you a tease
You change locks so I change keys
Giving always, giving how ya living it's a drain
Hard to see the light as anything but a train
Is passion out of fashion, am I on the wrong track
Hard for me to take but can you tell what I lack
Been the early bird but I gets no worm

Treat me like a germ but I still stand firm
Chasing am I wasting all my time on the cause
Do you want a break or do you need a pause
Never knew no one like you that is never impressed
Is it how I'm dressed or am I just a pest
I think you bend me just to see if I will break
Evasion from the case just to see what I will take
Lead me, lead me on because you know I wanna swing
Question that I'm pressing is there anything
Is there anything more I can do for you
Should my hair be red or shall it be blue
Is there anything more I can do for you
Shall I let the green grass turn black for you
Is there something more you want me to do
Shall I hand up all of my secrets to you
Maybe then you'll see me too
Is there something more
Do you want a break or do you need a pause
Do you want a break or do you need a pause
Do you want a break or, do you want a break or, do you want a break or do you need a pause
Do you want a break or, do you want a break or, do you want a break or do you need a pause
And the beat keeps going on
Hard for me to take but can you tell what I lack
Hard for me to take but can you tell what I lack
Hard for me to take but can you tell what I lack
Is there anything more I can do for you
Should my hair be red, or shall it be blue

Is there anything more I can do for you

Shall I let the green grass turn black for you
Is there something more you want me to do
Shall I hand up all of my secrets to you
Maybe then you'll see me too
Is there something more
Is there anything more I can do for you
Should my hair be red, or shall it be blue
Is there anything more I can do for you
Shall I let the green grass turn black for you
Is there something more you want me to do
Shall I hand up all of my secrets to you
Maybe then you'll see me too
Is there something more
