To know her is to see
That nothing is as it seems
She'll show her true face when you're
Stripped of all belief
Sweet tyrant, laying out the course with what you need
To send you through the veils
Of Eternity

Crack me open or I'll go down
On this sinking ship, don't leave
Me to drown
Still the water bears the sound
Of my eternal plea
And all I found

And all I will...

She calls you with a mirage
Of what you want to see
You fall into her arms
As she shatters all your dreams
Sweet violence, aimed to crack the shell from which you bleed
And send you through the tree of Eternity.

Crack me open or I'll go down
On this sinking ship, don't leave
Me to drown
Still the water bears the sound
Of my eternal plea
And all I found
And all I will...
