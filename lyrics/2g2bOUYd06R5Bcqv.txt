I'm so sick of being drunk
I'm so sick of being blind
I regret all the pills I took
That wrapped a suffocating rope around my mind
I'm feeling self-destructive
I hate the words I let live
Defensive rants that I give
That mean nothing at all

How do you hate me now?
How do you hate me now?
How do you hate me now?
How do you hate me now?

I'm so sick of being drunk
I'm so sick of being blind
I regret all the pills I took
That wrapped a suffocating rope around my mind
I'm feeling self-destructive
I hate the words I let live
Defensive rants that I give
That mean nothing at all

How do you hate me now?
How do you hate me now?
How do you hate me now?
How do you hate me now?
