I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

When the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines till they weep
With future pixels in factories far away

So call the mainland from the beach
All parties now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

I got a feeling now my heart is frozen
All the verses and the corrosion

Have been after native in my soul
I prayed on the unmovable
Yeah, clinging to the atoms of rock
Seasons, the adjustments
Times have changed
I can't see now, she said "taxi"
Now that light is so I can take
This storm bring strange loyalties and skies
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower

That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
Here we go again
That's electric
That's electric
Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time every day, same routine

A clear target in the summer when skies are blue
Its part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Nature's corrupted in factories far away
Here we go again
That's electric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky
That's electric

With future pixels in factories far away
Here we go again
That's electric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky
That's electric
With future pixels in factories far away
Here we go again
