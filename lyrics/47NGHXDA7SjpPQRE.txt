You can't make, you can't make a mistake
On these kind of ice skates
You can talk, I'll lie around
So don't you be the black plastic case for your glasses
You fail to feel time affect you
And I don't think your confusing refusal to heal
With all your selfishness singing, "I know how, I know how you feel."
