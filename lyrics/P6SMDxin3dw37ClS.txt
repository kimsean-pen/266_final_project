I got a feeling that he might be mad
All a sudden I'ma just fine detached, I'm just fine detached
I'm just tryna relax
I got a feeling that he might be cold
Said he a menace but I might be sold, yeah I might be sold,
I despise that role

I tried to fight it but I might be too sore
Keep it bottled up like some rare liquor
That we save for when we don't need to save no more
(No more no more)

Tried to light it but I might be too late
Wouldn't it be funny if things my went my way, my way
(This once this once, my way)

If we play this out, darlin, can you be the villain?
You can my break my heart, darlin don't that sound appealing?
Real fun real fun
(Real fun real fun real great!)

Show me how it's done, done done
Lately I been terrified, tired of being numb (tired of bein' numb)
I ain't tryna be numb
Swearing you're the one one one
Keep falling in line when you're tryna fall in love
You ain't gonna fall in love
You ain't gonna fall in love

I got a feeling that he might be mad
All a sudden I'm just fine detached, I'm just fine detached
I'm just tryna relax
I got a feeling that he might be cold
Said he a menace and I might be sold, yeah I might be sold
I despise that role

Often mistaken for a teasa but I ain't here to please ya
Act like I'm an option like hello nice to meet ya
It's an occasion, bring your own vices
Life of the party but she damn near lifeless
Curve in her back but she feel real spineless (feel real spineless)

I got a feeling that you might be mad
All a sudden I'm just fine detached, I'm just fine detached
I'm just tryna relax
I got a feeling that he might be cold
Said he a menace but I might be sold yeah I might be sold
I despise that role
Yeah it gets quite old

I got a feeling that you might be mad
All a sudden I'm just fine detached, I'm just fine detached
I'm just tryna relax

Said he a menace but I might be sold yeah I might be sold
Yeah I might be sold
I despise that role
Yeah it gets quite old
