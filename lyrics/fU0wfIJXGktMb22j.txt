Let the Blackbirds kiss Me
My Rhine Atrocity
Oh, let the Blackbirds kiss Me
My carcass beauty

Time lost is never regained
Time lost is never the same

Of Pure Heart
Of Pure Hound
Too few, too many
Oh, let the Blackbirds kiss Me

Time lost is never regained
Time lost is never the same

Oh, let the Blackbirds kiss Me
Let the Blackbirds kiss Me
Oh, let the Blackbirds kiss Me
My Rhine Atrocity

Something of the terror
It's in Our Blood
So, let the Storm Flower flow
Nectar from above
I hold you in contempt
Like a guilty dog
My Rhine barbarity
Shrouded in secrecy

Time lost is never regained
Time lost is never the same

Let the Blackbirds kiss Me
Oh, let the Blackbirds kiss Me
Let the Blackbirds kiss Me
My Rhine Atrocity
Oh, let the Blackbirds kiss Me
Let the Blackbirds kiss Me
Oh, let the Blackbirds kiss Me
My carrion trophy
Oh, let the Blackbirds kiss Me
Let the Blackbirds kiss Me
Oh, let the Blackbirds kiss Me
My Rhine Atrocity,...
