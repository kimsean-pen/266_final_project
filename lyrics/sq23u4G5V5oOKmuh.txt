You are where I go to hide
When the wind starts to blow
When the lightning starts to strike
When the thunder starts to roll
When this life becomes a fight
You are where I put my gloves down
When I'm running out of time
You are where I go to slow down

You are my favorite place
You are my sacred space
Yes you are, yes you are, yes you are

Where I go 'til we move
Where I go 'til we steal
Your love makes me new
In your presence I heal

You are my favorite place
You are my sacred space
Yes you are, yes you are, yes you are

No walls, no war
No cause, no weapon is formed
No law, what for?
You are where I go to hide
You are where I go to heal
You are where I go to feel
To remember what is real, ooh

You are my favorite place
You are my sacred space
Yes you are, yes you are, yes you are
Ooh
