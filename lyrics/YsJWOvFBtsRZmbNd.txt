In the distance there is truth
which ends like a knife
The bridge we have laid will always be this life
when you cross on a goat we ride
or full like fruit
in the red sea tide

If you could understand. You would take my hand.
And i would spread so far, just like Arcadia.

the snake is time, his teeth are seed
they press like flesh, on those who bleed
the cross is gold
cause its all wrong
the goat is bold**
and it eats the dark**

If you could understand. You would take my hand.
then I would spread so far, just like Arcadia.

dust to dust, dust to dreams
anoint the stone, in blood and screams
they're rotten omen
they rise and fall
they mask the blood
like the old

If you could understand, you would take my hand.
then I would spread so far, just like Arcadia.

the door of light
is loud and full
it hides the face
he cannot kill
the moon our eyes
the future leaks
the path is made
and it's shell is weak

If you could understand, you would take my hand.
and I would spread so far, just like Arcadia.

Just like Arcadia
just like arcadia
just like arcadia
