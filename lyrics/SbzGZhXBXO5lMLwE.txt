Everybody get down

She's just a friend, you see, you always agree
You know I lie but you still trust me
And you believed in so much hope
But I'm the one who let you go

Now that we're done I'm so sorry
Why did I lie? I'm so sorry
I know I hurt you
Well, I know I hurt you

Now that we're done I'm so sorry
Why did I lie? I'm so sorry
I know I hurt you
Well, I know I hurt you

Whoa, everybody get down
Whoa, everybody get down
Everybody get down

You still call my phone 'cause you still want me
I'll tell my friends you're so annoying
You'll cry and curse when you're alone
But laugh and flirt when we're on the phone

Now that we're done I'm so sorry
Why did I lie? I'm so sorry
I know I hurt you
Well, I know I hurt you

Now that we're done I'm so sorry
Why did I lie? I'm so sorry
I know I hurt you
Well, I know I hurt you

Whoa, everybody get down
Whoa, everybody get down
Everybody get down

And now I see you with him
And it was nothing like I thought it'd be
(And I'll break down for you)
And now I see you with him
And it was nothing like I thought it'd be

Now that we're done I'm so sorry
Why did I lie? I'm so sorry
I know I hurt you
Well, I know I hurt you

Now that we're done I'm so sorry
Why did I lie? I'm so sorry
I know I hurt you
Well, I know I hurt you

Now that we're done I'm so sorry
Why did I lie? I'm so sorry
I know I hurt you
Well, I know I hurt you

Now that we're done I'm so sorry
Why did I lie? I'm so sorry
I know I hurt you
Well, I know I hurt you

Whoa, everybody get down
Whoa, everybody get down
Everybody get down
