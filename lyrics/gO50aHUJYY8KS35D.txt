Get up 'outta' your rockin' chair grandma!
Or rather would you care

To dance grandmother?

Hey you! Give up to the ghost
That's haunting you now
Woah
Shout it out
Don't let it stay inside

And eat you alive

Make up your mind
Don't you want to stay
This side of the line
Eeee
I can assure you
When you're my age
You'll learn

From all you've left behind
Eeee

(You've got to)
Dance little sister
Don't give up today
Hang on 'till tomorrow
I don't wanna hear you're late
(You got to)

Dance little sister
Don't give up today
Hang on 'till tomorrow

Don't give up your stay
Tu-tu-tu-tu

Say say say now share the weight
And lay your cross down
Huh
And let the long reaching arm
Of hope bring you around
See well
It ain't easy but giving up
Is the easy thing to do
Woah
Time is on your side
Would you just watch the clock
And let it tick for you
Huh woah
