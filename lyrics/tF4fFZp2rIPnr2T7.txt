Larry call a load of smoke in
I wanna lose a couple days
We've probably never struggled coping but
I never want to
Promise again that I would call her
Forget the time because I'm 7 hours behind
It's probably good I didn't call though
But I always want to

I'd beg you but you know I'm never home
I'd love you but I need another year alone
I've tried to ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close

I don't think through things
I never get time
'Cause I don't think things through

I wanna disappear for days
We've probably never struggled sleeping but

Promise again that I would call her
Forget the time because I'm 7 hours behind

But I always want to

I'd beg you but you know I'm never home

I'd beg you but you know I'm never home
I love you but I need another second to myself
I've tried to ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close
I'd beg you but you know I'm never home
I'd love you but I need another year alone
I've tried to ignore it every time you phone
