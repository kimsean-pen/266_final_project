I've got a cold, heart, cold hands
Make you want to be where I am
If you only knew my plans
Oh, if you only knew who I am

Normally, I'd break your heart
I'd love every minute, tear you apart

Late at night I lie awake
just thinking about your pretty face

I've got cold, heart, cold hands
Make you want to be where I am
If you only knew my plans
Oh, if you only knew who I am

Normally, I'd break your heart
I'd love every minute, tear you apart

I'll never leave you on the wire
So let me touch your fire
Oh, I'm cold, sick and I'm tired
So baby, let me touch your fire

I'll never leave you on the wire
So baby, let me touch your fire
I'm cold sick and I'm tired
So let me touch your fire
