High tide
Summer in the city
The kids are looking pretty
But isn't it a pitty that the sunshine
Is followed by thunder
With thoughts of going under
And is it any wonder why the sea

Is calling out to me
I seem to spend my whole life
Running from people who can be
The death of you and me
'Cause I can feel the storm clouds
Sucking up my soul

High tide
Life is getting faster
No one has the answer
I'm trying to face the day in a new way
The botton of a bottle
Is every man's apostle
Let's run away together you and me

Forever we'd be free
Free to spend our whole lives running
From people who would be
The death of you and me
'Cause I can feel the storm clouds
Sucking up my soul

Let's run away to sea
Forever we'd be free
Free to spend our whole lives running
From people who would be
The death of you and me
'Cause I can feel the storm clouds coming

I'm watching my TV,
Or is it watching me?
I see another new day dawning
It's rising over me and my mortality
And I can feel the storm clouds
Sucking up my soul
