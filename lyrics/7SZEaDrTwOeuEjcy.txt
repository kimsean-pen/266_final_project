Hold onto love
That is what I do
Now that I've found you
And from above
Everything's stinking
They're not around you

And in the night
I could be helpless
I could be lonely
Sleeping without you

And in the day
Everything's complex
There's nothing simple
When I'm not around you

But I miss you when you're gone
That is what I do
Ba-ba-by
And it's going to carry on
That is what I knew
Ba-ba-ba-by

Do-be-da
Do-be-da
Do-be-da
Do-be-da

Hold on to my hands
I feel I'm sinking
Sinking without you
And to my mind
Everything's stinking
Stinking without you

And in the night
I could be helpless
I could be lonely
Sleeping without you

And in the day
Everything's complex
There's nothing simple
When I'm not around you

And I miss you when you're gone
That is what I do
Ba-ba-by
And it's going to carry on
That is what I knew
Ba-ba-by
