Heartbreak (heartbreak)

I've tried to hold myself together
Tried to forget you've gone away
The tears I've cried
They won't subside
Unless the music starts to play

Heartbreak, make me a dancer, dancer
DJ, give me the answer, answer
Love, stop getting me down, down, down
(Do it alone, I couldn't do it alone)
Heartbreak, make me a dancer, dancer
Keep my heart beating faster, faster
Love, stop bringing me down, down, down
(Do it alone, I couldn't do it alone)

I need to feel I'm getting stronger
Long as I'm moving it feels true
And with each step (with each step)
I will forget (I will forget)
Forget all of those memories of you

(Keep it coming)
Keep it coming on and on and on

Heartbreak, make me a dancer, dancer
DJ, give me the answer, answer
Love, stop getting me down, down, down
(Do it alone, I couldn't do it alone)
Heartbreak, make me a dancer, dancer
Keep my heart beating faster, faster
Love, stop bringing me down, down, down
(Do it alone, I couldn't do it alone)

Heartbreak (heartbreak)
Heartbreak (heartbreak)
Do it alone, I couldn't do it alone

Dancer (dancer)

Heartbreak, make me a dancer, dancer
DJ, give me the answer, answer
Love, stop bringing me down, down, down
(Do it alone, I couldn't do it alone)
