If I ever leave you baby
You can say I told you so

And if I ever hurt you
You know I hurt myself as well
Is that any way for a man to carry on?
Do you think, I want my loved one gone?
Said I love you

More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know
When I wasn't making much money
You know where my paycheck went

You know I brought it home to you baby
And I never spent one red cent
Is that any way for a man to carry on?
Do you think I want my loved one gone?
Said I love you

More than you'll ever know, yeah
More than you'll ever know
Now listen to this.
I'm not trying to be
Just any kind of man
No I ain't
I'm just trying to be somebody

You can love, trust and understand
I know I know I know that I can be
A part of you that no one else could see, yeah

But I got to hear you say
I got to hear you say
It's allright
I am only flesh and blood

But I could be anything that you demand
I could be king of everything
Or just a tiny grain of sand
Now tell me
Is that anyway for a man to carry on?
Do you think that I want my loved one gone?
I love you
More than you'll ever know
I said I love you
I love you
I love you
