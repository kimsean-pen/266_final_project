(MF Doom)
Villain get the money like curls
They just trying to get a nut like squirrels in his mad world
Land of milk and honey with the swirls
Where reckless naked girls get necklaces and pearls
Compliments of the town jeweler
Left back now-schooler trying to sound cooler
On the microphone known as the crown ruler
Never lied to ma when we said we found the moolah
Five-hundred something dollars laying right there in the street
Huh, now let's try and get something to eat
Then he turned four and started flowing to the poor
That's about when he first started going raw
Kept the 'dro in the drawer
A rhyming klepto who couldn't go up in the store no more
His life is like a folklore legend
Why you so stiff? you need to smoke more brethren
Insted of trying to riff with the broke war veteran
Spliff made him swore he saw heaven he was seven
Yup, you know it, growing up too fast
Showing up to class with MoÃ«t in a flask
He ask the teacher if he leave will he pass
His girl is home alone he trying to get the
If you want to sip get a paper water fountain glass
How I'm 'posed to know where your mouth been last
Hands so fast he can out-spin the Flash
Known to smoke a whole mountain of hash to the ash
Boom-bash leave the room with the stash
Assume it's in a smash, Doom get the cash
