Wasteland's Caress
I mourn thee by dusk
I mourn thee by dawn
Crave for thy gloss
to seek the silent glades beyond
precious a glance
thy veils now unfold
tearfull she dance
into this nightfall I behold
Grieve at night
Thy bereavement and thy loss in life
Grieve by day
Thy devotion and thy pass away
Beyond the veils of dawn
from where she Siren calls
The sunset seize within as I walk
Through velvet dusk and dawn
condemned to rise and fall
So grievous through the night she calls
the beauty I once lost
I mourn thee my beloved
Far beneath thy heavens lost
where I once pale and cold
beheld thy rarest rose...
I mourn thee by dusk
I mourn thee by dawn
Crave for thy gloss
to seek the silent glades beyond
precious a glance
thy veils now unfold
tearfull she dance
into this nightfall I behold
Grieve at night
Thy bereavement and thy loss in life
Grieve by day
Thy devotion and thy pass away
Beyond the veils of dawn
from where she Siren calls
The sunset seize within as I walk
Through velvet dusk and dawn
condemned to rise and fall
So grievous through the night she calls
the beauty I once lost
I mourn thee my beloved
Far beneath thy heavens lost
where I once pale and cold
beheld thy rarest rose...
