When loneliness is knocking on your door
Everything you loved
Just disappears
And when you feel that everything is lost
You need to know
There's no life without tears

Tell me black or white
What colour is your life
Try to ask your heart
Who you really are

No one is
Forever beautiful and young
Everything you know
Just disappears
Fame and gold are nothing you can be sure
When there is no love in your heart
The choice is yours
Who you really want to be
Don't be afraid of your destiny
So when you feel
That everything is lost
You need to know
There's no life without fear

Tell me black or white
What colour is your life
Try to ask your heart
Who you really are

Every day we must fight with the wind
We have to live
All these things are just empty desire
'cause there's no smoke without fire

Tell me black or white
What colour is your life
Try to ask your heart
Who you really are
Tell me black or white
What colour is your life
Try to ask your heart
What colour is your life
