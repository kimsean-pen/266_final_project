Sometimes I wish we never kissed in the daytime
Sometimes I think I only know you in the nighttime when we're high
To only open up when you feel violent

It's not life
It's not life
It's not like
It's not like
When we're high
When we're high

Laying on the soccer field with the stars out
Feeling rain on your face, but the whole earth was dry
To only open up when you're feeling drunk

It's not life
It's not life
It's not like
It's not like
When we're high
When we're high

One, two, one two three
Here we go

That velvet dress
That velvet dress
That velvet dress
That velvet dress
That velvet dress
That velvet dress
That velvet dress
