High on the bell tower
I took my view
Over the downtowns
On the avenues
Where the streets are wide
And the people thrive
And it's further to fall down
'Cause you fly so high

I've never seen such beauty
I've never seen such clear skies
I've never seen such high hopes
I've never seen such tired eyes

And I wish that I could be
Everything you are
Everything you are

Down in the delta
The city wakes
Turns on the TV
As the levee breaks
Where the streets are burned
By the summer sun
And there's nowhere to run to
When your time has come

I've never seen such beauty
I've never seen such clear skies
I've never seen such high hopes
I've never seen such tired eyes

Pulled the roots up piece by piece
Felt life washing over me
Took my pills and I went to sleep
Oh, I sang myself to sleep

And I wish that I could be
Everything you are
Everything you are
And I wish that I could see
The world the way you do
As selfishly as you

Yeah, and I wish that I could be
Everything you are
Everything you are
And I wish that I could stick
My faith the way you do
As certainly as you

Clear skies gonna fall on you
Clear skies gonna fall on you
Clear skies gonna fall on you
On you
On you
Clear skies gonna fall on you
Clear skies...
