Heavy make-up masks her face
Her appearance doesn't tell anything
No expression in her voice
When spoken to she seems absent
The innermost hidden from the outside
Locked and sealed
In place of her eyes, deep hollows
Locked and sealed
She acts like an industrial machine
Without emotion, a means to an end
Never answering to the gazes she gets
Muted, callous, introverted, blank, devoid
Never was anyone able to connect with her
Withdrawn, wayward, weird, peculiar, out of reach
Underneath the shroud of bricks and stones
A river starts to form
Made of all her broken dreams, her numbed desires
Her exhausted spirit finds a way when she's all alone
All alone
The innermost hidden from the outside
Locked and sealed
In place of her eyes, deep hollows
Locked and sealed
Underneath the shroud of bricks and stones
A river opened a way
Made of all her broken dreams, her numbed desires
Her exhausted spirit found a way
Through the tears of the eyeless
