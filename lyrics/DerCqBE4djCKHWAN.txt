Tormenting silence
The endless days bleed into
Nights where I begin to fade away
Burdened by failure, cannot remember
Why we hide within this fractured veil

Born of death, hiding just beneath the flesh
Desolate, this heart yearns for a reprieve
How could I pray for salvation?
When I'm the only mourner left to grieve

Baptized in shadows
Cleaned by the pain I bury
Betrayed, pretending I'm alive

Born of death, hiding just beneath the flesh
Desolate, this heart yearns for a reprieve
How could I pray for salvation?
When I'm the only mourner left to grieve

There he was laid to rest

I'm dreaming of your call that will never come
Holding on by a thread
