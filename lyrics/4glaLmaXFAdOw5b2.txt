And I shed my soul, feel it kneeling down
I'm clutching my faith, pull it tightly around
You're moving your mouth, but you don't make a sound
But I feel the walls, slowly tearing down

Heel to toe takes you from my side
In and out every breath divides
My eyes to your head, I can't go the distance
But when you go, you take me in an instante

But in this life, I'll give it time
'Cause it's always spinnin' up from behind
It'll be alright, it will be fine
'Cause it's nothing more than ordinary life

So I'll show you my sins, show me all your scars
As we settle, in it's written in the stars
Your watery eyes, got me simply floating
And my weak heart is swimming mith devotion

But in this life, I'll give it time
'Cause it's always spinnin' up from behind
It'll be alright, it will be fine
'Cause it's nothing more than ordinary life

But in this life, I'll give it time
'Cause it's always spinnin' up from behind
It'll be alright, it will be fine
'Cause it's nothing more than ordinary life
