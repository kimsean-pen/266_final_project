She floats like a swan
Grace on the water
Lips like sugar
Lips like sugar

Just when you think you've caught her
She glides across the water
She calls for you tonight
To share this moonlight

You'll flow down her river
She'll ask you and you'll give her
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

She knows what she knows
I know what she's thinking
Sugar kisses
Sugar kisses

Just when you think she's yours
She's flown to other shores
To laugh at how you break
And melt into this lake

You'll flow down her river
But you'll never give her
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

She'll be my mirror
Reflect what I am
Loser and winner
The king of siam

And my siamese twin
Alone on the river
Mirror kisses
Mirror kisses

Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
