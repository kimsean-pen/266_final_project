Gaze into the glass
See your loyal audience

You're a God, they worship you, kneel before your feet

You feel the need to display your shallow life
When you see the recognition, you feel divine

Archiving nothingness
To show to the ones blessed
Enraptured by your beauty

Seeking constant approval
From absolute strangers
Is a danger to your ego

You are Narcissus
Look into the water
Fall in love with the person staring back at you

You are a narcissist
Vanity consumed you whole, fixated with yourself

I'll be your nemesis
Fall in love with yourself and lose the will to live

You built a world
That revolves around you
Until tossed aside
Like a faded pearl
And all that's left
Frozen memories
Buried in a pixelated world
You worship in a church of mirrors
