My alarm starts to ring and I know
I gotta get up out of bed
Even though I'd rather stay here instead

Drag a comb through my hair I don't care
That my clothes don't even match
'Cause today I'm not gonna worry about that

I wanna be somebody else
'Cause I'm getting tired of myself

Wanna waste the day so hold all my calls
Gonna show up late if I show up at all
Need some time to crash so don't take it personally
Blame it on the loser in me

Here's the plan stay at home
Lock the doors all alone
I don't want no company
'Cause I got my guitar and my TV

Order in throw the trash on the floor
I don't care about the mess
'Cause today I'm trying hard to forget

I wanna be somebody else
'Cause I'm getting tired of myself

Wanna waste the day so hold all my calls
Gonna show up late if I show up at all
Need some time to crash so don't take it personally
Blame it on the loser in me

Wanna waste the day so hold all my calls
Gonna show up late if I show up at all
Need some time to crash so don't take it personally
Blame it on the loser in me

I just need one day then I'll be alright
Let me hide away from my so called life
'Cause I lose my head every now and then
And I feel just like it's happening again
Again

Wanna waste the day so hold all my calls
Gonna show up late if I show up at all
Need some time to crash so don't take it personally
Blame it on the loser in me

Wanna waste the day so hold all my calls
Gonna show up late if I show up at all
Need some time to crash so don't take it personally
Blame it on the loser in me
