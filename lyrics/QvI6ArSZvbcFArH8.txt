No-no-no-no, no, I'm not bitter, I'm not mad
Well, maybe just a little, just a tad
I know every apple here ain't bad
But I found a worm in every single one I had

(BOYS) They're only good for fruit, I mean bananas.
(BOYS) Them boys are nuts, they're drivin' me bananas
(Oh BOYS) we should pack them up and ship 'em out.
The Bo-bo-boys, bo-boys
The Bo-bo-boys, bo-boys
I hate 'em

I hate boys but boys love me
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys, but boys love me
Eh yeah, eh yeah, eh yeah
I. Hate. BOYS!

If you hate 'em boys, shake it, shake it
If you hate 'em boys, shake it, shake it

We would all be happy all be glad
If sweet mama nature never had
All this dirty little boys who think that the girls
Are only made for tooooys
(BOYS) Boys are so immature, the rarely turn to men
But then again all men are dogs "ROOF"
All men are dogs

I hate boys but boys love me
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys but boys love me
Eh yeah, eh yeah, eh yeah
I. Hate. BOYS!

If you hate 'em boys, shake it, shake it
If you hate 'em boys, shake it, shake it

Let's go
Boys suck
Make me sick
Inflated egos
Little dicks
Use them up
Spit 'em out
I H-A-T-E boys!

I hate boys but boys love me
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys but boys love me
Eh yeah, eh yeah, eh yeah
I. Hate. BOYS!

I hate boys but boys love me
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys but boys love me
Eh yeah, eh yeah, eh yeah
I (I). Hate (hate). BOYS!
