Hope unknown, sometimes just waking is surreal
I pass right through the nameless ones
I know that hope's unknown, sometimes the water feels so real
As I walk through it fills my lungs, my god I'm drowning

This day never seems to end
This pain, never
This day never seems to end
This rage I cannot let go

I hear them calling my name
I feel them gnawing out holes
All throughout my flawless soul

I hear them calling my name
I feel them gnawing out holes
All throughout my flawless soul

So alone, sometimes I swear that I can hear
The taunting of the voiceless ones
I fear that I alone fear those who finally ceased to feel
That they're alone inside this place, I am the misplaced

This pain, never
This day never seems to end
This rage I cannot let go

I hear them calling my name
I feel them gnawing out holes
All throughout my flawless soul

I hear them calling my name
I feel them gnawing out holes
All throughout my flawless soul

Now every face looks familiar
Found every face would melt away until now
Everyone, do you know?
I know your deception

Now every face looks familiar
Found every face would melt away until now
Everyone, do you know?
I know your deception

I hear them calling my name
I feel them gnawing out holes
All throughout my flawless soul

I hear them calling my name
I feel them gnawing out holes
All throughout my flawless soul
