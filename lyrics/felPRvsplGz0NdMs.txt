I don't need no diamonds or a fancy car
Or a jet to fly me right up to the star
I just need your guidance, since we've been apart
I feel your love beside me, mending my broken heart

I see you, I call your name
Oh, I'm trying on this Christmas day
I feel you, I hear you say
I know you're not okay, I know it's not the same
But you love me, and that will never change
Oh, and I love you on this Christmas day

I know you see me smiling, holding back my tears
Just nothing compares to this
Without you to share it with, my dear
I'm thinking 'bout the good times
Wishing you were here
I'm gonna celebrate, drinking your favorite, cheers

I see you, I call your name
Hope you're flying on this Christmas day
And I feel you, I hear you say
You're gonna be okay, I know it's not the same
But you love me, and that will never change
And I love you on this Christmas day

I know you're somewhere
That's beautiful in every way
I know you're somewhere
That I will be with you one day
I know you're right there
I close my eyes and hear you say you love me
And that will never change, no no
And I love you on this Christmas day

I see you, yeah, I called your name
No more crying, no, on this Christmas day
I feel you, I hear you say
It's gonna be okay, I know it's not the same
But you love me, and that will never change
And I love you on this Christmas day
And I miss you, yes, every single day
