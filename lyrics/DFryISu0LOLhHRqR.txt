this is for your sisters covering the pictures. you
know. we cover all the blisters, staring at the
distance. and time becomes your heartache, i'm
fine. become your lungs! i can't take this i can't
get this heart under control. i can't take this i
can't get this far without your heart. this is for
your sisters crossing all their fingers. they look
at our pictures, blaming their existence.
