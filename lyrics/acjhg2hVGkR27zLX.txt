If you want a radio, I would be a radio for you
If you want an aeroplane, I would be an aeroplane for you
If you got a lonely heart, I would be a lonely heart for you
If you want a rocket ship, I would be a rocket ship for you
If you walk the galaxies, I would walk the galaxies for you
If you'll be my lonely girl, I would be a lonely boy for you
If you want a shaded star, I would be a shaded star for you
If you want another world, I would be another world for you
If you wanna universe, I will be a universe for you

If you want a radio, I would be a radio for you
If you want an aeroplane, I would be an aeroplane for you
If you got a lonely heart, I would be a lonely heart for you
If you want a rocket ship, I would be a rocket ship for you
If you walk the galaxies, I would walk the galaxies for you
If you'll be a lonely girl, I would be a lonely boy for you
If you want a shaded star, I would be a shaded star for you
If you want another world, I would be another world for you
Always Together With You
If you'll be a lonely heart, I would be a lonely heart
If you'll be a lonely heart, I would be a lonely heart
