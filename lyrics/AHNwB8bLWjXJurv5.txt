Take a look around, don't you see it
See that you are the only real face in the room?
No one here has a clue what you're feelin'
Don't feel bad, keep your sadness alive

Look at all these happy people
Living their lives
Look at all these plastic people
There's nothing inside

Look at all these shallow people
Telling their lies
Look at all these empty people, people

Don't you know
That misery loves company?
Yeah, I heard
That misery was looking for me

Happiness is a face
That don't look good on me
Yeah, I heard
That misery comes looking for me

Whoa, misery's my company
Whoa, misery is looking for me
Looking for me

The hands are up now, everybody see it
Everybody's movin', they program their feelings
They're synchronizing and criticizing
Don't feel bad, keep your sadness alive

Look at all these happy people
Living their lives
Look at all these plastic people
They're dying inside

Look at all these shallow people
Telling their lies
Look at all these empty people, people

Don't you know
That misery loves company?
Yeah, I heard
That misery was looking for me

Happiness is a face
That don't look good on me
Yeah, I heard
That misery comes looking for me

Whoa, misery's my company
Whoa, misery is looking for me

Don't you know this misery loves me?
Don't you know this misery loves me?
Don't you know this misery loves me?
Don't you know this misery loves me?

Loves me

So you're tired of runnin'
You're tired of hurting
You're tired of living in their lies

You're tired of listening
You're tired of hurting
Keep your sadness alive, alive, alive

Don't you know

Yeah, I heard
That misery was looking for me
Happiness is a face
