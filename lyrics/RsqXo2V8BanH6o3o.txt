Life after youth
Faded in twilight
The dawn of a criminal in bloom
First love
First forgiveness
We were delinquants
Freaks of a faded memory

Outlaws
When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
Outlaws of forever

Scars
Broken hearts
Breaking in cars
Running in the light of the moon
Lost souls
Bottle rockets
All that we wanted
It's for our lives beyond stars

Outlaws
When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're Outlaws all forever, baby

I've got no supervision
Nothing will change my spirits
Race around with my innocence
I'll plead my innocence
But thats my best defense
When you are young

Outlaws
When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws all forever

I found a knife by the railroad track
You took a train and you can't go back
Forever now
Forever now
You'll roam
