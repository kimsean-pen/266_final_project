Haven't seen you for long
Heaven knows where you have gone
Would the words still ring true?

Did you see what I saw?
Did you hear wherever the call was coming from?
Would your mind be set free
where the river meets the sea?
Would it all come too true
if it all came down to you?

Where would you dare to go?
What would you dare to know?
If it all comes down to you
