I don't care
What the people may say
Cause it's just the sun
Rising again

So I'll take a trip
To the back of my mind
See what is there
What will I find

Cause you've got trouble searching for you
And you said: "Everything will be the same"
Look here, everything is gonna change
And you said: "It's what I needed"
I don't believe it

I don't care
What the people may say
Point out my flaws
I already know

So I'll drive away
Back to the heart
Of where I grew up
Back to the start

Cause you've got trouble searching for you
And you said: "Everything will be the same"
Look here, everything is gonna change
And you said: "It's what I needed"
I don't believe it

Take what you wanted
Leave what you didn't need
Take what you wanted
Leave what you didn't need
Take what you wanted
Leave what you didn't need
Take what you wanted
Leave what you didn't need

Take what you wanted
Leave what you didn't need
Take what you wanted
Leave what you didn't need
Take what you wanted
Leave what you didn't need
Take what you want
Leave what you didn't need

(Take, leave)
(Take, leave)
(Take, leave)

Take what you wanted
Leave what you didn't need
