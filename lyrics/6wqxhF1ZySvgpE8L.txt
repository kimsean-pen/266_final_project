ou think that there's a way
Could ever get too far
You'd ask me where I've been
Like I ask you where you are
I know you're in the pew
This ain't the stools around the bar
And I know I saw your hand
When I went out and wrapped my car

Street lamp, around the street lamp

So I wrote you love letters
And sung them in my house
All around the silence
The broken strings and amplifiers
Scream with holy noise
I hope to draw you out
If no one sings along
And prays we used to prow

When I opened, my mouth
Oh, come visit me

Come visit me
In the back of an ambulance
The saline communion
That I held like you say

In my arms, on the blacktop
The devil in my arms, said feed me to the wolves tonight

And come visit me
In the back of an ambulance
The saline communion
That I held like you say

In my arms, in my arms
