Hammer pounding in my heart, I think it's gonna burst
Spring unwinding in my head, I don't know which is worse
I hear you talking but the words are kinda strange
One of us is crazy and the other one's insane

Stay calm, don't be alarmed
It's just a holiday
Back at the funny farm

Nothing in this cold white room to help me recognise
I don't understand why everyone is in disguise
I gotta leave right now, I can't stay here no more
But I'm afraid to try in case they lock the door

Stay calm, don't be alarmed
It's just a holiday
Back at the funny farm

Can't find no windows but I gotta get outside
Can you help me stand? It feels like both my legs have died
What was that injection? 'Cos I think it's going wrong
I really like this jacket but the sleeves are much too long

Stay calm, don't be alarmed
It's just a holiday
Back at the funny farm
