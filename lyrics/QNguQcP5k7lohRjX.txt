Used to be that I believed
The good was gone from my life.
And it got so bad
I almost had a mind to
End it outright.

But now I see the light.
I made it through the night,
And it feels so good
To stand in the sunshine

Way back when,
Stuck in the pen,
I suffered through the long days.
Then, one day woke up like, holy fuck,
Everything turned out ok!

I can't say I'd kept faith,
But I'm so stoked to say that
I wake up smiling every single day
I'm free, at last. I'm free at last.
My darkest days are all in the past.

I'm free. At last
Now I see the light,
I made it through the night,
And it feels so good to
Stand in the sunshine.
In the sunshine,
I'm free at last.
I'm free. At last.
I'm free at last
