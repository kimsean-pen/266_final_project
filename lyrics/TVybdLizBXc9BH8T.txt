You'll be accepting my apology
For taking things too seriously
Sometimes I'm old enough to keep routines
Sometimes I'm child enough to scream

For everything, I broke in two
You're barely missing me
I'm missing you and everything you do
I really do, I really do, sure I do

My once photographic memory
For recollection's sake is failing me
I can't remember for the life of me

Sometimes I can think to recite
Words that I read and rewrite
My pens paint people that I've proven wrong

Sometimes I can think to recite
Words that I read and rewrite
My pens paint people that I've proven wrong
We move on

Get a job where I tell, all of my accounts of someone else
I'm quick enough to judge that they were wrong
That we knew it all along, sing a long, long winded song
I would be content to hum along, hum

If I state that my fingers know where to show
What everyone should have known, I'll let it go
Hopefully you'll forget any words that I put in print
My luck, you'll change, have strength enough to walk away

Sometimes I can think to recite
Words that I read and rewrite
My pens paint people that I've proven wrong

Sometimes I can think to recite
Words that I read and rewrite
My pens paint people that I've proven wrong
We move on

Sometimes I can think to recite
Words that I read and rewrite
My pens paint people that I've proven wrong

Sometimes I can think to recite
Words that I read and rewrite
My pens paint people that I've proven wrong
Read and rewrite it wrong
