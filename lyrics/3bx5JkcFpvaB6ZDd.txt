How you drag me into the crater.
You kiss me ever so wildly.
If you kissed me here, 70 years ago, oh, what a romantic ending.
It clearly used to be one of the most obscure parks.
Now there's smoke of a different kind here.
Is there possible one or the other absurd and romantic mind here.
How we are standing at the bay of angels, at the most immaculate beach ever.
If the earthquake drags us into the ocean, oh, what a poetic ending.
They say they are tired of our no future.
They can't understandour self-torture and our constant flirt with death is because we live for the moment.
