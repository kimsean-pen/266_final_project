Absorbing your words
Battles raging within me
Absorbing your words
Is gradually tearing my soul in two
There isn't much I could do
Despite my fear it helps to
Share my nostalgia with you

There isn't time to stand still
We are constantly changing
You're draining my will
I find myself rearranging my points of view
There isn't much I could do
Despite my fear it helps to
Share my nostalgia with you

Tomorrow I remember yesterday
Tomorrow, remember yesterday
Tomorrow, remember yesterday
Tomorrow I remember yesterday

Whatever lies in my past
Or what is yet in the future
Time passes so fast
Suppose there's always the danger
I won't pull through
I'll have to think this thing through
Despite my fear it helps to
Share my nostalgia with you

Tomorrow I'll remember yesterday
Tomorrow I remember yesterday
Tomorrow, remember yesterday
Tomorrow, remember yesterday

Tomorrow, remember yesterday...
Tomorrow, nostalgia will lead me away
