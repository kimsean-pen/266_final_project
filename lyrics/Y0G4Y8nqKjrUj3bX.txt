Hey, cruel world, you don't have what it takes
We don't need your faith, we got fucking fate
Hey, cruel world, you don't have what it takes
We don't need your faith, we got fucking fate

Creator, preserver, destroyer
Ask which one I am
There's no drugged-out devils or square-halo angels walking among us

I am among no one
I am among no one
I am among no one
No one

Hey, cruel world, you don't have what it takes
We don't need your faith, we got fucking fate
Fate, fate, fate

The centre of the universe cannot exist when there are no, no edges
The centre of the universe cannot exist when there are no, no edges

Hey, cruel world, you don't have what it takes
We don't need your faith, we got fucking fate
Fate, fate, fate
Fate

Fate, fate, fate
Fate, fate, fate

I am among no one
I am among no one
I am among no one
No one

Hey, cruel world, you don't have what it takes
We don't need your faith, we got fucking fate

Fate, fate, fate
Fate, fate, fate
Fate, fate, fate
