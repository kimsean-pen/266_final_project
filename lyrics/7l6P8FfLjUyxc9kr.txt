So if you don't know names, it's just rumours,
I don't know what you're talking about
If you know something and you feel like you... well if you feel like you know something, I feel like you need to speak up
Otherwise, that is it at all, if it's just a rumour
Then we're grown, we don't need to bring things up like that
'Cause you know there's enough people that talk shit about you daily
And there's no reason for me to come back to you unless it's real
Or unless I thought it was real
So, invalid
