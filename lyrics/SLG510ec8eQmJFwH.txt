Romulus, from the wolf's mouth I feed eternity
Romulus, with my brother's blood I opened wide the gates of time

Standing at the hill cliff
A flock of birds crown me
I am fathered by the god of war, I am the king of Rome

Then his jealousy blooms, the envy to lead my people:
So perish everyone who shall leap over my wall!

Romulus, from the wolf's mouth I feed eternity
Romulus, with my brother's blood I opened wide the gates of time

Rise the Legions that ____ by the kingdom
Within my beating heart, the sword and spear shall govern

Remus defied me, and I shall strike upon those who disobey me with death!

I am Romulus
I am the king of Rome
An empire shall rise!

Romulus, from the wolf's mouth I feed eternity
(Romulus!)
Romulus, with my brother's blood I opened wide the gates of time
