I could never take it
I was never one to be tough
Someone says we'll make it
I never thought that I could
Follow up the paces
Every time your misery clears
A spectacle of mercy
Running down the hope that appears
Listen up I mean it
There's something here between us to hear
Think I wouldn't notice
Something else is fighting my fear
If I had one more try I could fly with her
Hide away the years
If I had one more life I could die with her
A whisper in her ear
Everything is rising
Like I never hoped that it would
Somewhere down inside me
I could never find what was good
Memories are tough here
Heartache is rougher than time
Someone left a promise
I'm already aching to try
Who would ever want it
Who would ever even dare
Hope remains hopeless
The joke is that it's always there
If I had one more try I could fly with her
Hide away the years
If I had one more life I could die with her
A whisper in her ear
