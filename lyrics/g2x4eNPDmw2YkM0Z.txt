From the belly of the abyss
Unfurling like a cat
Stretching, pawing, yawning, stumbling
Into the sun

It's never been easy
For you and I
No, it's never been easy
For you and I

I didn't know how much you loved me
I didn't know until I had my own little daughter
Oh, my mama, I understand now
That you've always loved me more, ooh

It's never been easy
For you and I
No, it's never been easy
For you and I

I've been told that I arrived to
The cawing of a bird
Crying, yelling, screaming, howling
Into the sun

It's never been easy
For you and I
No, it's never been easy
For you and I

It's never been easy
For you and I
No, it's never been easy
For you and I
