Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight
See the young man sittin' in the old man's bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

The cowboy kills the rock star
And Friday night's gone too far
The dim light hides the years on all the faded girls
Forgotten but not gone
You drink it of your mind
You talk about the world
Like it's someplace that you've been
You see you'd love to run home
But you know you ain't got one
'Cause you're livin' in a world
That you're best forgotten around here

Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight
See the young man sittin' in the old man's bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

You choke down all your anger
Forget your only son
You pray to statues when you're sober up for fun
Your anger don't impress me
The world slapped in your face
It always rains like hell on the losers day parade
You see you'd love to run home
But you know you ain't got one
'Cause you're livin' in a world
That you're best forgotten
When you're thinkin' of a joke
And nobody's gonna listen
To one small point
I know they been missin' round here

Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight
See the young man sittin' in the old man's bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

You see you'd love to run home
But you know you ain't got one
'Cause you're livin' in a world
That you're best forgotten
When you're thinkin' of a joke
And nobody's gonna listen
To the one small point
I know they been missin' round here, round here

Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight
See the young man sittin' in the old man's bar
Waitin' for his turn to die
