Jonny gutar calling Gosta, Berlin
We're coming over for the weekend
Hide in the forest, create our own law

Jonny gutar calling Gosta, Berlin
We're coming over for the weekend
Drive through the forest of fire and cars
Cut up the novels whilst smoking cigars

Stuck in the traffic, luxury bags
Tracking the burning, slow down to rags
