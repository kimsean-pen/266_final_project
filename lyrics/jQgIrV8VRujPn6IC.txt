Maybe it's much too early in the game
Ah, but I thought I'd ask you just the same
What are you doing, doing in New Year's Eve?

Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight
When it's exactly 12 o'clock that night
Welcoming in the New Year's Eve

Maybe I'm crazy to suppose
I'd be the one you chose
Out of the thousand invitations you received

Ah, but in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?

Maybe I'm crazy to suppose
I'd be the one you chose
Out of the thousand invitations you received

Ah, but in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year's Eve?
