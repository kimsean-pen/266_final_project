Through the clouds i see the light
my conscience tells me
what's wrong and right
morals and goals deep inside
a bunch of feelings i can't hide,
but that's me
it's the way i live
my outlook on life is positive!
so what should i hide
or try to conceal
all of these feelings
that i feel
like to sit and talk about them
i want to stand and shout them!
