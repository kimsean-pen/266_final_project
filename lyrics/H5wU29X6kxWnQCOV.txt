You get to feel so guilty
You got so much for so little
Then you find that feeling just won't go away
You were holding on to every little thing so tightly
'Til there's nothing left for you anyway
Goodbye...
You can keep this suit of lights
I'll be up with the sun
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down

You wanted to get somewhere so badly
You kinda lose yourself along the way
You change your name, but that's okay, it's necessary
What you leave behind you don't miss anyway
Goodbye...
You can keep this suit of lights
I'll be up with the sun
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down

And I'm already gone
Felt that way all along
Closer to you every day
Didn't want it that much anyway

You're taking steps that make you feel dizzy
Then you learn to like the way it feels
You hurt yourself you hurt your lover
Then you discover
What you thought was freedom just was greed
Goodbye...
No emotional... good night
I'll be up with the sun
Are you still holding on
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down

Gone... sun... time... sun...
Gone... sun... gone... sun...
Sun...
