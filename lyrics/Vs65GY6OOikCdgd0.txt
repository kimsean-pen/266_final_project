I'll show you for example
A situation that's like one too
And that can't really look at my time
It's harder in the morning

My room's too small for parties
Too spacious when you're lonely
So books can make us friends
That's as long as we're reading

Turn the light's off when you're leaving
I want to watch the car park empty
It's easy when they're strangers to wave goodbye

My brother's back off holiday
He's been chasing girls in Spain
He said he'd bring me a guitar
Which I said would bring me fame

I remember your excitement
Choosing pictures for your wall
And now you've seen them oh so often
You hardly see them any more

Turn the light's off when you're leaving
I want to watch the car park empty
It's easy when they're strangers to wave goodbye

I remember your excitement
Choosing pictures for your wall
And now you've seen them oh so often
You hardly see them any more

Turn the light's off when you're leaving
I want to watch the car park empty
It's easy when they're strangers to wave goodbye
