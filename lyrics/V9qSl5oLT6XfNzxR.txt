Stuck in a metal tube
I sit and stare at you
You seem to look through me
I wonder what you see

I still have two stations yet,
counting the one we just left
Wish I could stay with you
and ask you what you do

I figure you love to read
Don't look for the faults like me
You probably love the sun
I think you're the only one

I wish I could wake at dawn,
to see you without make-up on
Wish I had the guts to say,
You look the best today
You look the best today
You look the best today

I feel I know your smile,
like I saw it when I was a child,
Though today you just frown and read,
Your eyes flicker perfectly
Rush-hour crush surrounds
Reminds me that we're still in town
I think of the time when I
Sat and watched a stranger cry

I wish I could wake at dawn,
to see you without make-up on
Wish I had the guts to say,
You look the best today
You look the best today
You look the best today
You look the best today
You look the best today

As I get off the train,
look back to see you through the frame,
A man sits and blocks my view,
then I forget you
