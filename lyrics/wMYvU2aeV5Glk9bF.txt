Lovers with no single care at all
Busy catching shadows off the wall
Higher than the grass with ten feet
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
Laughing in the clouds, a perfect view
Purple in your eyes like sweet taboo
Linger in the air like ooh ooh
When I'm with you, when I'm with you

Let's waste away together
Let's waste away forever
Let's waste away together
Just you and me

Let's waste away together
Let's waste away forever
Let's waste away together
Just you and me

Kisses off your lips taste royalty
'Toxicated by the air we breathe
Paradise together daily
When I'm with you,
When I'm with you

Drunk in love and getting lost at sea
On the run, we chase infinity
Puzzle pieces fit in perfect
When I'm with you
When I'm with you

So let's waste away together
Let's waste away forever
Let's waste away together
Just you and me

Let's waste away together
Let's waste away forever
Let's waste away together
Just you and me

Forever and ever and ever and ever
And ever and ever and ever
Forever, just you and me

Let's waste away together
Let's waste away forever
Let's waste away together
Just you and me

Let's waste away together
Let's waste away forever
Let's waste away together
Just you and me
