Is this not an inquisition baby
You're not the first I've told
That I'm gonna wake up lonely someday
And I'm gonna wake up old

You took me higher and higher and higher
But then that was a while ago
And I got a restless feeling baby
So I think it's best you know

Oh I could have done the righteous thing
But we're all gonna die someday
I'm not gonna look you in the eye
And tell you it's all okay

Runaway
It's okay
Runaway
It's okay

Now I got a new position
And it's difficult to address
There ain't no easy way of saying
That I'm getting it off my chest

You took me higher and higher and higher
So I'm sorry to be so low
But I got a restless feeling baby
And I think it's best I go

Oh I could have done the righteous thing
But we're all gonna die someday
And maybe I lack discretion darling
But I don't know what to say

Runaway
It's okay
Runaway
It's okay

Oh I could have broke your heart I guess
But what else could I have done?
And I'm looking after number one now
Baby I gotta, baby I gotta, baby I gotta run

Runaway
It's okay
Runaway
It's okay
