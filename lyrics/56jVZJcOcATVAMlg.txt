I can still remember the picture on the postcard (that you sent
me) of green fields and silos
And I used to pretend that I could see you just like you were
watching me and every move I made
Every step I took
Every train I rode
Every time I looked for you but could never find you
So I put you on my wall and spent the days waiting for you
there
Is it cold out where you live
Is it so far where you live
If silence breaks and I let go, I'll put my ear up to hear if
you've finally come to save me
If I've been wrong to care so much then what am I to do now
What am I to do now
I hung it on my wall and looked for you there every night to see
if you were waiting to wave
