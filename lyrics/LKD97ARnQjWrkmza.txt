It's up to you, you know it is
I can't convince you all you have to do is slow down
I've always said it will never change
All you have to do just you be you
Think that's all I want to say

And all the things I've ever told you
I didn't mean at all, I didn't mean at all I'd forget you
So if you come here, if you come here
All you have to do just you be you
Think that's all I want to say to you

Aah, ooh, aah, ooh
Aah, ooh, aah, ooh

And all those things that I told you
I didn't mean at all, I didn't mean at all, I'd forget you
So if you come here, if you come here
All you have to do just you be you
Think that's all I need to say to you
