Hiding in the fog
Where darkness meets the moonlight
I will sing our melody
Till the morning comes

Living for you only
Take my hand and show me
There will be much sorrow
When the morning comes

Fearless I'm fighting
The pain burns inside of me
Find the forces of my soul
No one can understand me
Am I condemned to ride the blackest night alone

Tragic painting on the walls
In this castle where affliction reigns
So many died in vain
Hear their distant cries
Never again!

This is my symphony
My Dark blessing falls from the sky
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me
I'll find my peace another way
Under the stars where we'll shine again some day

Torment and sadness unleashed through these corridors
Fear is leading to the night
Bloodline of vampires doomed to fulfill the need
Once united by the light
Father! Look into my eyes
I shall kill you tonight to avenge
All those who died in vain
Hear their distant cries
Never again!

This is my symphony
My Dark blessing falls from the sky
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me
I'll find my peace another way
Under the stars where we'll shine again some day

This is my symphony
My Dark blessing falls from the sky
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me
I'll find my peace another way
Under the stars where we'll shine again some day

To the stars where we'll shine again some day

To the stars where we'll shine again some day
