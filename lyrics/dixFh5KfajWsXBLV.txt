Here we are stuck by this river
You and I underneath a sky
That's ever falling down down down
Ever falling down

Through the day as if on an ocean
Waiting here always failing to remember
Why we came came came
I wonder why we came

You talk to me as if from a distance
And I reply with impressions chosen
From another time time time
From another time
