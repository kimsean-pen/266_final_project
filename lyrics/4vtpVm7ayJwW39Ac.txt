He was a captain of industry
He was a captain of the sea, oh.
He was a gentle man,
with cracks and lines across his hands, oh.

Iron waves crashed on his face,
made him feel less alone, oh.

She was engaged to be a bride
With eyes so true, he could have cried, oh.
She watched him cry on his knees
"Dear Ollie, please let me be", oh

Iron waves crashed on his face,
made him feel less alone, oh.

"Ollie," she said,
"Leave me be"

She left him, he left everything.
