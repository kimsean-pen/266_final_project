Get in mind
Now often you won't let it up.
Feeling tired,
Get's in my bones through the night.
While I'm awake,
I cannot say,
It's odd to be nervous to leave my love at your gate.
So don't hold back
and I'll get to greeting you good.
Voice breaks,
Feeling like I thought it would.
Mornings with me,
Oh I cannot say,
As long as you know it then lets get on with the day.
Let's unwind,
Don't worry your mind,
There's paradise waiting for us in summertime.
The warm thoughts set your tension's aside,
There's a paradise waiting for us in summertime.
When you look in my eyes you'll find the pleasure is mine,
There's a paradise waiting for us in summertime.
When I'm making you smile then it's the perfect delight,
It's paradise waiting for us in summertime.
Get inside
Because you're never often enough.
Feeling right,
Get's in my faults through the rough.
While I'm away,
I cannot wait,
Now, don't you be nervous my love, it's for you to take.
So don't hold back,
and I'll get to treating you good.
Voice breaks,
Feeling like my heart, it shook.
Mornings with me,
While I hope you stay,
As long as to notice when it's the time and the place
Let's unwind,
Don't worry your mind,
There's paradise waiting for us in summertime.
The warm thoughts set your tensions aside,
There's a paradise waiting for us in summertime.
When you look in my eyes you'll see the pleasure is mine,
There's a paradise waiting for us in summertime.
When I'm making you smile then it's the perfect delight.
It's paradise waiting for us in summertime
