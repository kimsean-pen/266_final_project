In my primal love
In my primal love

In my primal love
Don't try to cover me from what I'm feeling
In my primal love
Don't be afraid
In my primal love
I see where all the burning fire's hidden
In my primal love
I see your flame

So I try to satisfy
My fallen dove, my fallen dove
I'm never gonna be the one, my fallen love
But I'm never gonna be your savior

I'm never gonna be the one
I'm never gonna be the one, my fallen dove Don't cry for the things you love, my fallen dove
Cause they die

My man holds a lighter
For the day I clamp his fire
My man holds a lighter for our love

So I try to satisfy
My fallen dove, my fallen dove
But I'm never gonna be your savior

I'm never gonna be the one, my fallen dove
Don't cry for the things you love, my fallen dove
Cause they die in time
