Take me, break me
Use me for your messy love
Steal me, beat me
Use me for your messy love
Take me, break me
Use me for your messy love
Steal me, beat me
Use me for your messy love

Yeah, girl, I've always been a hard hitter
Deep convictions to the bone
I never wanted you to try me
But you refuse to take my note
Don't you think that we should be together?
Say our prayers to the same ghost
We know that we don't have forever
So tell me what it is you want
(Yeah)

Take me, break me
Use me for your messy love
Steal me, beat me
Use me for your messy love

Will you be my girl
Will you be my girl
Will you be my girl
Will you be my girl
Will you be my girl
Will you be my girl
Will you be my girl
Will you be my girl
Will you be my girl
Will you be my girl
Will you be my girl
Will you be my girl
Will you be my girl
Will you be my girl
Will you be my girl
Will you be my girl
