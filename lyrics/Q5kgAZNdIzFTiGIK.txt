Live forever burning in the moment (ohoh ohoh)
Turn up all the senses cause we own it (ohoh ohoh)
We are one
We are with the light
We're the sun
Through the darkest night
The truth is in your eyes and now I know it

We are everything tonight
Give us everything tonight
We own everything tonight
Taking everything tonight
Feeling everything tonight
Loving everything tonight

Everything tonight
Everything tonight
Everything tonight
Everything tonight
Everything tonight

You see through our veins the music's racing (ohoh ohoh)
Louder than oblivion defacing (ohoh ohoh)
We are one
We are with the light
We're the sun
Through the darkest night
The universe is ours for the taking

We are everything tonight
Give us everything tonight
We own everything tonight
Taking everything tonight
Feeling everything tonight
Loving everything tonight

Everything tonight
Everything tonight
Everything tonight
Everything tonight
Everything tonight

Everything tonight

We are everything tonight
Give us everything tonight
We own everything tonight
Taking everything tonight
Feeling everything tonight
Loving everything tonight

Everything tonight
Everything tonight
Everything tonight
Everything tonight
Everything tonight
