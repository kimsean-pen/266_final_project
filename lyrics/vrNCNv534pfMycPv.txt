Huwah...
Down too long like I was before
And I've never thought I'd see the day
Can't be wrong, cause I know the score
And I guess there is no other way

Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!... Reminded!

There it is, all in black and white
And it looks like that's the way it goes
Doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Cause by now I'm sure that I know

Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!... Reminded!

Never felt so undecided
Everything I've ever had has been taken away
Little boy so scared and frightened
All of the things that have happened
I'm surely to blame... Blame!

Accept your fate, then you'll be well
But the truth is that it never ends
You can say that you've been through Hell
But you'll always lose another friend

Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!... Reminded!

Never felt so unimportant
Everything I've ever said has been taken in vain
Little girl so scared and frightened
All of the things that I do are still subject to change

Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!
Reminded of you!... Whoa!
