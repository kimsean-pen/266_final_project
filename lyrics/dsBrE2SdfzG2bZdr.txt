Standing outside your door
I had to come here
It's never been like this before
You give me something

I'm addicted to the way
You got me lifted
All my senses pushed so high

My heart beats loud and strong
Thumping in my chest
Every second is a lifetime long
As I hear your footsteps

There's no stopping this
I'm craving what you give
Your love that takes me to the sky

So come on fill me, with emotion
Come on fill me, with emotion
Come on, kiss me
And I'm floatin
I wanna feel this, feel this emotion with you
I wanna feel this, feel this emotion with you

Warm when I see your face
You pull me closer
I say your love won't ever go to waste
As I rest on your shoulder

I can't comprehend
The way you pull me in the way
You never leave my mind

Have you really any idea?
Of how you could hurt me
For you I make my soul clear
So don't desert me

Grab me up in your love
When these times get tough
And say you'll never leave my sight

So come on fill me, with emotion
Come on fill me, with emotion
Come on, kiss me
And I'm floatin
I wanna feel this, feel this emotion with you
I wanna feel this, feel this emotion with you

Give me the feeling that I need
Let it wash over me
From my head down to my toes
You make me feel like I'm afloat

If I got you then I'm okay
I won't hurt you, I won't stray
So let me in and close the door
Nothing really matters anymore

Fill me, with emotion
Fill me, with emotion
Come on, kiss me
And I'm floatin
I wanna feel this, feel this emotion with you
I wanna feel this, feel this emotion with you
I wanna feel this, feel this emotion with you
I wanna feel this, feel this emotion with you
