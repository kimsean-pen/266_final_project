I see you
You see me
How pleasant
This feeling

The moment
You hold me
I missed you
I'm sorry

I've given
What I have
I showed you
I'm growing

The ashes
Fall slowly
As your voice
Consoles me

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
We're swaying
To drum beats
In motion
I'm feeling

My patience
Controlling
The question
I won't speak

We're telling
The stories
Our laughter
He knows me

We're leaving
We're talking
You're closer
It's calming

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
The night will hold us close and the stars will guide us home
I've been waiting for this moment, we're finally alone
I turn to ask the question, so anxious, my thoughts
Your lips were soft like winter, in your passion, I was lost

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
