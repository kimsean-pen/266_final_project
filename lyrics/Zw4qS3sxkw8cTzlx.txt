The sutures in my head keep getting ripped out
These open wounds are the thoughts I can't stop thinking about
Digging for purpose, feelings resurface
And involuntarily my system gets nervous
Tell me tonight that you'll be by yourself
'Cause something bad will happen if you are with someone else
I'm just all fucked up, and I really need your help
I really need your help
There's a lot of hollow souls out there all alone
And they're waiting for you to invite them back into my home
They touched and they took what was rightfully mine
Now I'm the devil, and their souls just went up in price

Set me free, I think I'm giving up
Don't wait for me, I think I've had enough
Set me free, I think I'm giving up
Don't wait for me, I've had enough, enough now

I pour myself to sleep into a glass that you keep
And that's all I'll ever be if you don't set me free
I know it's hard, but I'll be damned if I live in your hands
So, please, put me down so I don't feel a thing
My pretty little face with all the right parts
My pretty little face I couldn't keep from the dark
I learned from the best as my sorrows grew
And then they pulled me out after I introduced them to you
We're just two wrong souls that met at the wrong time
So just go your way, and I'll go mine
You'll be alone with someone new until the day that you die
And I'll watch from afar to make sure you're alright

Set me free, I think I'm giving up
Don't wait for me, I think I've had enough
Set me free, I think I'm giving up
Don't wait for me, I've had enough, enough now
Set me free, I think I'm giving up
Don't wait for me, I think I've had enough
Set me free, I think I'm giving up
Don't wait for me, I've had enough, enough now

Set me free, I think I'm giving up
Don't wait for me, I think I've had enough
Set me free, I think I'm giving up
Don't wait for me, I've had enough, enough now
