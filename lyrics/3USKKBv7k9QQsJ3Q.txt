She leaves her phone in the middle of every dark room
She fills her nose up a little right on the bathroom floor
Oh, slow down
I think this shit is killing your brain
She said, "It's hard to explain
But babe, I think we feel the same kind of way"

Well, give it up
Baby, just give it away
She don't ever wanna stop
Never wanna stop doing her thing
Well, keep it up, keep it up
Keep riding the wave
Oh, baby, keep it up
Baby, keep it up
Riding the wave

Over obsessive with every second, a waste of time
She gets aggressive the very second she takes that line
Well, calm down I hate to see that look on your face
She said it's hard to escape
But girl, I think you've gotta give it a break

Well, give it up
Baby, just give it away
She don't ever wanna stop
Never wanna stop doing her thing
Well, keep it up, keep it up
Keep riding the wave
Oh, baby, keep it up
Baby, keep it up
Riding the wave

Move slow, I don't wanna get in your way
Well the words in your mouth so cool but I'd rather be kissing your waist
She said, "Baby boy, I don't think I'm feeling my face"
Well, don't go
Please don't make me beg you to stay

Well, give it up
Baby, just give it away
She don't ever wanna stop
Never wanna stop doing her thing
Well, keep it up, keep it up
Keep riding the wave
Oh, baby, keep it up
Baby, keep it up
Riding the wave
