Summer's here and i'm in love with you
Doing things that you and me wanna do
Alright baby
We're smoking up by the pier
And we're happy and there's nothing to fear
Cus summer is here
And we're all alone
Come make this party known
Let's call our friends on the phone
It's better than staying home
Bring the weed and bring all your friends
We'll fuck the stars in the sky again and again
Alright baby
We're shooting up by the pier
And we're happy and there's nothing to fear
Cus summer is here
And we're all alone
Come make this party known
Let's call our friends on the phone
It's better than staying home
