You know I flaunt cha, cuz girl I really want cha
And you lookin' nice, got me cooler than a bag of ice
Now freeze, freeze, freeze
Now go
Drop it fast and move it real slow

Oooh!
What?!
You smell so fruity
I'm a pirate and you're my booty (arg)

So move it in close
And let me have my daily dose (uhhh)

Girl, I've been thinkin' about you, thinkin' about me,
Whatcha think about it?
Five fingaz to the face (eh eh eh-ehh)
Five fingaz to the face (oh its like that)

Five fingaz to the face (rip rip rip-rear)
Five fingaz to the face (eh eh eh-ehh)
I love Martina, Vanessa, and Georgina
It's a ladies choice, so I'ma make sure to make some noise (oh)
And now we're sweatin'
Got my turbo engine reevin', (vroom)
They stop and stare, all the haters think it's just not fair,
That I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun,
And I'm about to put this club in gear
So fellas grab a cup, (what)
All my ladies you know what's up, (yeah)
Put your hands to the sky if you're feelin' fly,
And tell me that you, (what?!)
Cuz I'm the man in charge,

And ya know I'm livin' large
I got a big white house and a fancy yacht,
And a garage full of classic cars,
What you talking bout' boy?
Oh calm down

I know you don't think you can just come up in here and buy me!
Come on,
You know what I got for you!
Five fingaz to the face (rip rip rip-rear)
Five fingaz to the face (eh eh eh-ehh)
Five fingaz to the face (rip rip rip-rear)
Five fingaz to the face (eh eh eh-ehh)
OOOH!!!
