Don't tell me you can't love yourself
You can love yourself, like you never felt
Can tell you I was scared to try
Don't be scared to try, if you look inside
You could be anything
I could be anything

Some of us we haven't had a dream

Maybe I'm drifting, maybe I'm gone
Maybe I sold my soul for a song
Maybe I'm blind, maybe I see
You know just what I mean
Maybe I'm drifting, maybe I'm lost
Maybe I found every line I'd cross
Some of us we haven't had a dream
Drifting just like me

(Drifting)
(Drifting)

Don't tell me you can't trust yourself
You can trust yourself, you got nothing else
Can't tell you why we live and die
But it's on my mind almost all the time
I could be fortunate
We could be fortunate

Some of us we haven't had a dream

Maybe I'm drifting, maybe I'm gone
Maybe I sold my soul for a song
Maybe I'm blind, maybe I see
You know just what I mean
Maybe I'm drifting, maybe I'm lost
Maybe I found every line I'd cross
Some of us we haven't had a dream
Drifting just like me

(Drifting)
(Drifting)
(Just like me)
(Drifting)
(Drifting)
(Just like me)
(Drifting)
(Drifting)

Maybe I'm drifting, maybe I'm gone
Maybe I sold my soul for a song
Maybe I'm blind, maybe I see
You know just what I mean
Maybe I'm drifting, maybe I'm lost
Maybe I found every line I'd cross
Some of us we haven't had a dream
Drifting just like me
