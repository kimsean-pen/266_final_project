I'm so tired of loving
With no hint of laughter
Oh-oh-oh
Goes on and on
You've got me at my worst
When I'm at my wit's end
Oh-oh-oh
Goes on and on
You make me so tongue tied
My words are unrefined
Oh-oh-oh
Goes on and on

Remember the night when
We came home?
Oh, a long time gone
Remember the night when
We came home?
Oh, a long time gone

Don't want mixed messages
I can't decode
Oh-oh-oh
Goes on and on
Can we fall back in love
Like we did before?
Oh-oh-oh
Goes on and on
Let me kiss your lips
We'll pass the argument
Oh-oh-oh
Goes on and on

Remember the night when
We came home?
Oh, a long time gone
Remember the night when
We came home?
Oh, a long time gone

Remember the night when
We came home?
Oh, a long time gone
Remember the night when
We came home?
Oh, a long time gone
