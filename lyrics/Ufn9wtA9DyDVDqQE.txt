I'm just a copy of a copy of a copy
Everything I say has come before
Assembled into something, into something, into something
I don't know for certain anymore

I'm just a shadow of a shadow of a shadow
Always trying to catch up with myself
I'm just an echo of an echo of an echo
Listening to someone's cry for help

Look what you have just done
Why all the change of heart
You need to play your part
A copy of a copy of a...
Now look what you've gone and done
Well, that doesn't sound like fun
See, I'm not the only one
A copy of a copy of a...

Look what you have just done
Why all the change of heart
You need to play your part
A copy of a copy of a...
Now look what you've gone and done

See, I'm not the only one
A copy of a copy of a...

Doing everything I'm told to do
Always my intention, my intention, your intention
Just doing everything you told me to

Look what you have just done
Why all the change of heart
You need to play your part
A copy of a copy of a...
Now look what you've gone and done
Well, that doesn't sound like fun
See, I'm not the only one
A copy of a copy of a...

Look what you have just done
Why all the change of heart
You need to play your part
A copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a...
Look what you've gone and done
That doesn't sound like fun
Yeah, I'm not the only one
A copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a...
