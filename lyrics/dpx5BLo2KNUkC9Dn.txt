It's so hot in here

Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air
And boy, don't stop cause I'm halfway there
It's not complicated, we're just syncopated
We can read each other's minds
One love united
Two bodies synchronizing
Don't even need to touch me
Baby, just

Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe

Oh, this is way beyond the physical
(Too way beyond the physical)
Tonight, my senses don't make sense at all
Our imagination, taking us to places
We have never been before
Take me in, let it out
Don't even need to touch me
Baby, just

Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe
Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe

Monogamy is the way to go
Just put your lips together and blow
Breathe, breathe

Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe
Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
