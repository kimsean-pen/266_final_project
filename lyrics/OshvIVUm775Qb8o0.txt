If I thought it would help
I would immolate myself
In full view of the camera crews, my counterclaim
But as we all know
The only tale that would be told
Would be that it was me and not them, who was insane

But who the fuck do I think I am fooling?
As if I know the first thing of sacrifice or selflessness
I'm a cop just out of frame
Who at the first sight of the flames
Throws himself prostrate to the ground in reverence
An act so pure we yearn to feel the burn

Who the fuck do I think I am fooling?
As if I know the first thing of sacrifice or selflessness
They say that Quang Duc's heart
Survived the flames unscarred
A righteous calling card
Left upon the palace gates
For the invertebrates
Their grip on power pried apart
By just one frail human being
No weapon, no war machine
