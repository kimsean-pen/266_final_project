Talking with myself in a land-locked parking lot
Cough drop tipping from my mouth like a love shot
My writer's block ink, oh, oh, oh

Sick of all the small talk, tripping non-stop
From the open-mouthed graves of the faux-hawk
Cinderblock mall, my blood clot pen, oh, oh, oh

Oh, maybe I could break clean
Yeah, maybe I could break clean

When I'm on your shore again
I can feel the ocean
I can feel your open arms
That pure emotion
I'm finally free again
Like my own explosion
When I'm on your shore again
I can feel the ocean
Saltwater running through my veins like a blind spot
Like I got caught, saltwater like your teardrop

With this saltwater heart, oh way oh
Now it's an abstract thought, but I've been thinking non-stop
'Bout the fact that my body's made most out of raindrops
With this saltwater heart, oh, oh, oh

Oh, maybe I could wash clean
Yeah, maybe I could believe

When I'm on your shore again
I can feel the ocean
I can feel your open arms
That pure emotion
I'm finally free again
Like my own explosion
When I'm on your shore again
I can feel the ocean

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

Oh, maybe I could wash clean
Yeah, maybe I could wash clean
All my land-locked dreams
And maybe I could believe

When I'm on your shore again
I can feel the ocean
I can feel your open arms
That pure emotion
I'm finally free again
Like my own explosion
When I'm on your shore again
I can feel the ocean

Yeah! Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
I can feel the ocean
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
