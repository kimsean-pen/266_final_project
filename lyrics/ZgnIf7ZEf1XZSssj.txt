We must have been stone crazy
When we thought we were just friends
'Cause I miss you, baby
And I've got those feelings again
I guess I'm all confused about you
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, shi-pow-pow

Suddenly we're strangers
I watch you walking away
She was my one temptation
Oh, I did not want her to stay
Deep down, I'm still confused about you
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, shi-pow-pow

What good is being here without you?
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
Oh yeah
I've been thinking about you
Got you on my mind
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you

Think about you babe
Think about, think about you babe
Think about, think about
Oh oh oh baby
Think about

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
thinking about you

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
thinking about you

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
thinking about you
