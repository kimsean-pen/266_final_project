I'm caught up when you look at me
You let my heart breathe with ease
Chasing stars in our galaxy
Making our own make-believe

I want you when the sun goes low
Your body warmth wants me close
You say you're always by my side
'Till my blood runs dry

And I know that I won't be the same without you
Don't let this moment slip away

I'll take you for a drive
Kiss me on the corner with your hand in mine
Ooh
Say you love me too
I'll give it to you

Freeze time when we align
Our love won't be confined
No way that the eye can hide
'Till the blood runs dry

And I know that I won't be the same without you
Don't let this moment slip away

I'll take you for a drive
Kiss me on the corner with your hand in mine
Ooh
Say you love me too

Here to stay
You and I
Dancing in the colour of the golden light
Ooh
Say you love me too
I'll give it to you

I close my eyes
I don't wanna escape
Let the tides rise in my heart

I'll take you for a drive
Kiss me on the corner with your hand in mine
Ooh
Say you love me too

Here to stay
You and I
Dancing in the colour of the golden light
Ooh, say you love me too
I'll give it to you
