I wear my heart on my sleeve
Don't act like that's a disease
Need ya'll to bear with me please
I just say what I see

We all just chasing a dream
In the land of the free
While we paying a fee to stay on es' concrete

Well, I don't know the price of your roof
But, on the first of the month we all pay our dues
When the rain falls, it don't rain on a few
When the sun shine, it don't shine just on you
I don't know the monsters you knew
But I'm tryin to forget the ones I met too.

Baby you could help me
Baby I can help you

You look at me and you see what I see
Because you're looking in the mirror.
When you're with me there's no use in hiding
Because you're looking in the mirror

Baby, Baby, Baby don't look away
Because you're looking in the mirror
'cause maybe, maybe, maybe we're just the same

Because you're looking in the mirror
We're all crossing paths
For a reason I know that
Hoping just to share some laughs
Avoid the broken glass
Have I met you i past

In a life that I lived last
You know they go too fast

God knows they go too fast
Well, I don't know the monsters you knew
But I'm tryin to forget the ones I met too.
Baby you could help me

Baby imma help you
You look at me and you see what I see
Because you're looking in the mirror.

When you're with me there's no use in hiding
Because you're looking in the mirror
Baby, Baby, Baby don't look away
Because you're looking in the mirror
'cause maybe, maybe, maybe we're just the same
Because you're looking in the mirror
Baby, baby
Baby, baby

It's the same pain
and when I wake
I hear the same wave
of sirens coming down my way eh eh eh ay

and I'll never try to leave you
Baby, you're the one I cling to
Baby, don't look away
Baby, don't look away
I am you.
You look at me and you see what I see
When your with me there's no use in hiding
Because you're looking in the mirror.
Baby, Baby, Baby don't look away
Because you're looking in the mirror
'cause maybe, maybe, maybe we're just the same
Because you're looking in the mirror
ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I am you, I am you.
Because you're looking in the mirror.
