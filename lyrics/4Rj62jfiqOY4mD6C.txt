All the sainted sinners they pay handsomely
And eventually? They make the weapons
And they run the prisons
And they sell the justice cause
Cause being guilty is
Just good business
And we'll be standing on the borderline
Ain't no one there gonna stop it now

Murrow turning over in his grave
(Murrow's turnin' over in his grave)
(Ed Murrow had a child the damn thing went wild)

Murrow turning over in his grave
(Murrow's turnin' over in his grave)
(Ed Murrow had a child the damn thing went wild)

Half-closed eyes
And the country's deadly
Do you feel the ooze as your brain drains out
From your pneumatic drills and sharpening knives
Blood in the sky
Are you dead or alive?
All the restless people and the bitter green
Well it fakes this gold, makes the spirit mean

Murrow turning over in his grave

Murrow turning over in his grave
Murrow turning over in his grave
Murrow turning over in his grave
Murrow had a child
Murrow turning over in his grave
Damn thikng went wild
Murrow turning over in his grave
Murrow turning over in his grave

Murrow turning over in his grave
Murrow turning over in his grave
Murrow had a child
Murrow turning over in his grave
Damn thing went wild
