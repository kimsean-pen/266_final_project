I hardly think about you anymore
Except when I see the water and the sand on the ocean floor
All the years that I've held you close
You should've been anyone else, I know
All the years that I've held you close
You should've been anyone else, I know

Sometimes the night brings me back to you
And I look at the time spent wasted on you
What a lie you were living then
You could've been somebody's better side
What a lie you were living then
You could've been somebody's better side
