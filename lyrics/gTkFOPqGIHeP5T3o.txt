I put off things that I hold dear, my heart aches from words unclear
You couldn't grasp my destined place, a place you need not to be
Curse me with hope, validate me the same
Use yours words please, tell me you hate me
I think I can handle fate

You lie like I don't But my word punctures through

No light shed on purpose, almost everyday
I feel my patience start to break

I'll take my turn with fate, my open arms are less giving
The marks on my legs from climbing steps, the steps I take so you digress
Figure I'll stay long, the effort was not bought, strictly borrowed from your grip
I'm losing a person I never deserved this but that's life I guess
You lie like I don't But my word punctures through

No light shed on purpose almost everyday
Connected with weakness and my desperate taste
I was no one to you, no that's not longer the case
I feel my patience start to bend and break
