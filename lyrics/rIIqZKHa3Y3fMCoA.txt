I feel the wind, the wind touches my face
Once again.

I feel the fire, the fire is dying.
Once again.

I see the earth changing, the world is amazing, but just not for me.

I see the stars shining far away.
I hide my face.

...And if this is real,
Then why don't I feel anything?
Don't you?
I know this is real, so why don't I feel anything?
