Don't know how well this is gonna be, but
The basic idea is

Free fall for now
Desert air won't drown you out
And for a second I thought the world was ending
And I couldn't breathe in, yeah
And so this isn't your time
Yeah, been chasing kairos with those scapegoat eyes
Can't you realize?
Fuck the summertime, it's you
So scared of overgrowing youth
When it's not done with you

And everybody gon' run, run
Everybody gon' run, run
And you can call it what you want
But I call it moving on and I'm so done
With singing words I don't believe in no more

Yeah
Oooh, yeah
So what you rushing for?
Who said it's now or never?
I think you're taking on the wrong advice
But it's alright if these are your worst times
You know you're good, you're good

And if you want, you can breathe on your own
This isn't what I thought, but it's beautiful
Make peace with your mistakes and they'll turn to gold
Weightless, I let go

And everybody gon' run, run
Everybody gon' run, run
And you can call it what you want
But I call it moving on and I'm so done
With singing words I don't believe in no more

No more
You could
And I
No more
Call it what you want
Call it what you want, but I call it growing up and I'm done
