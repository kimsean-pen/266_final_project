What if there was no light
Nothing wrong, nothing right
What if there was no time
And no reason, or rhyme
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life

What if I got it wrong
And no poem, or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong
And what if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life

That's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
That's right
How can you know it if you don't even try?

That's right

Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
That's the risk that you take
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life
That you don't want me there by your side

That's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
That's right
How can you know it when you don't even try?

That's right

That's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
That's right
You know that darkness always turns into light

That's right
