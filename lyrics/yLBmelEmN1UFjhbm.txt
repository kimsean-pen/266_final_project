I dig, I plant a walnut tree
I pour a lot of water in

Staring us
No disrespectful gaze
Centre of attention
Happy drunk, happy in a safe space

So proud to be a part of us
A chosen family
To love, to trust

Your eyes on me
We know, we know
Stay till tomorrow, then you can go
A taste of lion's paw, locked jaw
Stay here in the morning
How we're making love

I dig, I plant a walnut tree
I pour a lot of water in

No time for
There's a change in the atmosphere
What we are
Brings the wrong kind of attention out here

So aware
What's wrong with you, the morning mist
Cold, wet air
One hand in yours and one hand in a tight fist

I dig, I plant a walnut tree
I pour a lot of water in
