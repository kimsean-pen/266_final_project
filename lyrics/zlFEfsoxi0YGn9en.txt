12 years I've fought for this
12 years my heart still beats
For the ones who've stood beside me
Still strong, you can't break me

12 years I've fought for this
12 years my heart still beats
For the ones who've stood beside me
Through the values that define me
No compromise, no surrender
These beliefs, they make me whole
Never the breaker, promise keeper
Remains the ethic instilled in me

Never one to bite my tongue
Never turn, never run
I've seen with my own eyes
The price of life and the cost of lies

You can't shut this down, I still spit fire
This truth rings loud, you better listen up
You can't, you can't break me
You can't, you can't break me
You can't break me

12 years I've fought for this
12 years blood sweat and tears
For my family here beside me
True to the ethos held inside me
Life pushes hard, you push back
Time makes its mark, you gotta stand the test
Every dog has its day
We make it count, we find our own way

You can't shut this down, I still spit fire
This truth rings loud, you better listen up
You can't, you can't break me
You can't, you can't break me
You can't break me, yeah

12 years I've fought for this
12 years my heart still beats
For the ones who've stood beside me
Still strong, motherfucker, so step back

You should know by now
Here comes what's next
Through blood, sweat, tears
We're still here
Unbreakable
Unbreakable
Yeah, bring this shit down, oh
