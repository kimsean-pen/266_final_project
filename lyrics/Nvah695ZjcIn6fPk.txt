Watching her
strolling in the night so white
Wondering why
it's only after dark

In her eyes
a distant fire light burns bright
Wondering why
it's only after dark

I find myself in her room
feel the fever of my doom
Falling falling
through the floor
I'm knocking on the devil's door yeah

In the dawn
I wake up to find her gone
and the note
says "only after dark"

Burning burning in the flame
now I know her secret name
You can tear her temple down
but she'll be back and rule again yeah

In my heart a deep and dark
and lonely part
wants her and waits for
after dark
after dark
after dark
after dark...
