In this garden full of good
Lies a garden full of evil
Awaits strange, bizarre
Unusual people

Here is where
Tripping and nobody cares
Here is where
The setting sun is never feared

It goes on and on and on
Oh, it never ends
It goes on and on and on
Welcome my friends

Beneath the tree of heaven
Lies the horror of the clay
Beneath the tree of heaven
Come as you please, do as you may
Beneath the tree of heaven

Crooked minds like a crooked tree
Never caring where one's branches
Have been or where they're gonna be

People so seedy
People so greedy
In the end
Ain't we all a little needy?

It goes on and on and on
Oh, it never ends
It goes on and on and on
Welcome my friends

Beneath the tree of heaven
Lies the horror of the clay
Beneath the tree of heaven

Tree of heaven
Lies the horror of the clay
Beneath the tree of heaven
Come as you please, do as you may
Beneath the tree of heaven
