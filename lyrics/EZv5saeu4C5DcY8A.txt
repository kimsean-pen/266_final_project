I will take it to the wire now
Until every race is run
I'll go straight into the fire now
Until every day is done

Voices say, break away
Live the night as if each moment
Was the only one

Through the fire, to the wire
When the night out of control
Is breaking your heart

Through the fire, to the wire
When the flames are burning hot
They take you higher, through the fire

There's a feeling that I can't ignore
Like a stranger at my door
So revealing that I cannot hide
When you settle up the score

Voices say, night and day
Live your life as if each second
Was the final one

Through the fire, to the wire
When the night out of control
Is breaking your heart

Through the fire, to the wire
When the flames are burning hot
They take you higher

I look for signs that you are here tonight
When the passion calls the pleasure to the flame
Then I ask you of the meaning when you talk of love
Would you take the leap of faith? Would you throw it all away?

Through the fire, to the wire
When the night out of control
Is breaking your heart

Through the fire, to the wire
When the flames are burning hot
They take you higher

Through the fire, to the wire
When the night out of control
Is breaking your heart
