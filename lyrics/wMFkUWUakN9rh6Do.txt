Mix some water with your wine, young Davy
Take some time, Madeline
Cool it out
I'm tired of smashing glasses up the front steps of this house

You're living loose and playing hoops
At the women's Christian youth at the edge of town
I'm drowned in Crown
You're out of bounds
I need you now

You're crashing on the couch at your coach's house
We're headed south
I'm down and out
I'm down and out

It has been a cold autumn December
In our queen bed I still sleep on my side
You went on a cruise to the Bahamas
The steps are full of glass, I still get angry

It has been a cold autumn December
I heard you lost our wedding band in the sand
Sometimes I cannot evenly remember
It has been a cold autumn December
It has been a cold a cold December
It has been a cold autumn December
