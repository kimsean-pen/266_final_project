Summer in the city where the air is still
A baby being born to the overkill
Well who cares what people say
We walk down love's motorway

Ambition and love wearing boxing gloves
And singing hearts and flowers

But somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be
Is true

A star above the city in the northern chill
A baby being born to the overkill
No say, no place to go
A TV, a radio

Ambition and love wearing boxing gloves
And singing hearts and flowers

But somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be
Is true

Who could heal
What's never been as one
And our hearts have been torn
Since the day we were born
Just like anyone

From Westwood to Hollywood
The one thing that's understood
Is that you can't buy time
But you can sell your soul
And the closest thing to heaven is to rock and roll

But somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be
Is true
Somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be
Is true
