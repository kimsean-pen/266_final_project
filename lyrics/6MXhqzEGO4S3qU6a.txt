Hey, you see me down on the floor
I want you to take me higher
'Til I can't take it no more
It's gettin' bigger, the bass is gettin' bigger

And now you see me up in the sky
I was rockin' the bottom
Now look at me, I can fly
It's gettin' bigger, the bass is gettin' bigger

I can be your treble, baby
You can be my bass
You can be my bass
You can be my bass

I can be your treble, baby
You can be my bass
You can be my bass
You can be my bass

It's gettin' bigger, the bass is gettin' bigger
It's gettin' bigger, the bass is gettin' bigger
It's gettin' bigger, the bass is gettin' bigger
It's gettin' bigger, bigger, bigger

The bass is getting low
The bass is getting low
The bass is getting low
It's gettin' bigger, the bass is gettin' bigger

Hey, you see me out in the night
Wanna go out dancing
So I can feel alright
It's gettin' bigger, the bass is gettin' bigger

You take me out in the lights
I wanna have me a good time
The bass is feelin' nice
It's gettin' bigger, the bass is gettin' bigger

I can be your treble, baby
You can be my bass
You can be my bass
You can be my bass

I can be your treble, baby
You can be my bass
You can be my bass
You can be my bass

I can be your treble, baby
You can be my bass
You can be my bass
You can be my bass

I can be your treble, baby
You can be my bass
You can be my bass
You can be my bass

Y'all better get ready for the kick drum
For the kick drum, for the kick drum
Y'all better get ready for the kick drum
For the kick drum, for the kick drum

Yo, it's the kick drum, come and get some
Of the sound that's rockin' your system
When it pounds it 'cause an addiction
Y'all addicts better have a prescription

Me and Brit got the whole club trippin'
They sit and wait and listen
For the kick drum, for the kick drum
For the kick drum, for the kick drum

For the big, big, fat, fat bass
Rockin' all in your face
Vibrate, shake up the place
Right now, let's get crazy

Here we go, here we go, here we go
Everybody in the place get frantic
This beat right here's gigantic, yo

It's gettin' bigger, the bass is gettin' bigger
It's gettin' bigger, the bass is gettin' bigger
It's gettin' bigger, the bass is gettin' bigger
It's gettin' bigger, the bass is gettin' bigger

I can be your treble, baby
You can be my bass
You can be my bass
You can be my bass

I can be your treble, baby
You can be my bass
You can be my bass
You can be my bass

I can be your treble, baby
You can be my bass
You can be my bass
You can be my bass

I can be your treble, baby
You can be my bass
You can be my bass
