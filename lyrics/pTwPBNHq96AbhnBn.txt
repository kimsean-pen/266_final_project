i'm forested
i live alone
i'm islands in the sea
i'm tethered to your bones

i'm forested
i live alone
i'm islands in the sea

in the puring rain
we did oscillate
has our fastening meant enlessness for our love?

in the puring rain
we did oscillate
has our fastening meant enlessness for our love?

in the puring rain
we did oscillate
has our fastening meant enlessness for our love...

i could be heartache
i could be tender
i could be liar
i could be saint
i could be the darkness breaking at your window
or the pale light keeping you awake

i could be heartache
i could be tender
i could be liar
i could be saint
i could be the darkness breaking at your window
or the pale light keeping you awake

i'm forested
with tethered bones
your faceless when you sleep
don't ever bare it all

i'm forested
i live alone
i'm islands in the sea

in the pouring rain
we did oscillate
has our fastening meant endlessness for our love?
has our fastening meant endlessness for our love...
