There is a man in this world
Who has never smiled
You may know his tragedy
The later years, by heart
In the beginning
There was a mother, father and a child
A troubled little silent boy
Whose life they were to destroy
Known to us from this day on
By his father, Caleb

His mother came up with
Such a clever way to save the day with a little white lie
He thinks he missed the point back then
But now he's grown to understand it, in a way

"Father said "I'm sorry" only once, as I remember"
"The words were not meant to hurt,
Only destroy you, my stupid son..."
One person can make a difference, sometimes
Just turn his head when the kid is still
And has a weak neck

Smiled at his funeral
"Happy you're dead."

All his solutions, it seemed
Were only problems in disguise
Gluing on his drinking face
Got ready to erase another day

Mother was yet confident
Although they had it tight,
Taught her son:
"At the end of every tunnel's a little light."
It wasn't a lie, it was her hope
That everything would be fine one day
"He can fulfill his every dream,
I'm happy as long as he's not."

"I hate it and fear can't face it
The child is not right
He's my greatest shame"

Go out, create thunder
And stand right under
That old apple tree
Where dead snakes let him feed on

Lost hopes, all those kind words
Could hurt him even more, now
Somehow, lost one more way back home

Out on the lake, he rows towards a monster
He should've been running away from years ago
The past had made him blind
To the way he'd turned the pain into a way of life

Followed his father, tucked him in
Caleb knows the trade
He's the portrait of a man
His mother grew to hate forever
She was a beast, a deadly saint
Wrong in many ways
Wanted to keep up the charade
Until the end waltzing together

Over the hills, under the sea,
Fighting the will, whole Universe
Why does a man driving a hearse
Live in fear, gift and a curse

Taking 'em out, taking 'em all
Shooting the wall, over and out
When nothing moves, all's well
A decision he can find a way to live with

And the dried up flowers are so beautiful
And it applies to all things living, and dead
For that I serve my time
In my suite in Hell

"Now I ring the bell to tell the world
I'm ready when they bring out
The soon to be dead against the wall ..."
This necessary evil has no heart

Flowers and people he will now enlace
A price he must pay serving a cold
Whatever god
