He was so strong
he was so bold

When they made
him

they broke
the mold

If he heads
this way
when the moon
is slow

Come over
and pray

they'll turn
the buffalo

they'll turn
the buffalo

There's a need
to sleep
in the shag
of his stomach

Slide around
his eye
with your love
in tow

If he heads
this way
don't you say
hello

Get out of
the way

they'll turn
the buffalo

they'll turn
the buffalo

Our town
our town
do love a
stampede

Stampede by
my jacket
in the park

Someday I'll
pick it up
look for the
label and
whisper

Tilt

ain't got no
no no

Tilt

got none at
all

Tilt

ain't got no
no no

A mother waits
as still as
the moonlight

Standing in
long grass
with her

cold cold
nose

What she feels
so deep
she will never
show

Baby don't
you weep

they'll turn
the buffalo

they'll turn
the buffalo

Our town
our town
do love
a stampede

Stampede
by my old
jacket
in the park

Someday
I'll pick it
up
look for the
maker and
whisper

Tilt

ain't got no
no no

Tilt
got none at
all

Tilt
ain't got no
no no
not at
all
