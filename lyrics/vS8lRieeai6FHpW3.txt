Where did we go wrong
Where did we lose our faith
My brother is in need
But can he depend on me

Do you think if one of you tried
Maybe you could find
A better friend than any other

If you gave more than you took
Life could be so good
Come on and try, now's the time

'Cause you're free
To do what you want to do
You've got to live your life
Do what you want to do

Do what you want
Do what you want to do

Are we all strangers
Does anyone really care
Deep down we're all the same
Trying to hide our pain

You think you can never trust another
'Cause they're all out to get ya
We have to live in this world together

If we open up our hearts
Love can finally start
Come on and try, now's the time

'Cause you're free
To do what you want to do
You've got to live your life
Do what you want to do

Bridge when you're down and you're feeling bad
Everybody has left you sad
Feels like no one will pull you through
It's your life, whatcha gonna do

Make that change, let's start today
Get outta bed, get on your way
Don't be scared, your dream's right there
You want it, reach for it

'Cause you're free
To do what you want to do
You've got to live your life
Do what you want to do

Do what you want
Do what you want to do
