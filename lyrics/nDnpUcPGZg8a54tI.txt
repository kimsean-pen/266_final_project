This song is for my people
I wanna know where we going
I'm right beside you 07

Street lights twilights
There's a liquor store
By his playground
It's raining a cash flow
But it sits well at home
It's a hustle
Now a mother use to hustle
To a different tune
There's a midnight thrilling
And oh the traffic's heavy burning light
Don't slow you down
He thinks trouble fulfilling

Don't let me fall victim to this human nature
I know the way it is don't mean that's how its suppose
To be, oh I wonder where this broken
Place is going to take us, and where the
Way I want to know.

Street life crowded
That's his way out the illusion
Teachers failing
Our hero lives on TV
No my break keeps all eyes closed
While his are so open
Take it in three ways, I know it
Nowadays nothing wrong
Cause everything goes
We think trouble fulfilling

Don't let me fall victim to this human nature
I know the way it is don't mean that's how its suppose
To be, oh I wonder where this broken
Place is going to take us, and where's the
Way I want to know.

I want to know where (4 xs)
Know
Know

Don't let me fall victim to this human nature
I know the way it is don't mean that's how its suppose
To be, oh I wonder where this broken
Place is going to take us, and where the
Way I want to know.
