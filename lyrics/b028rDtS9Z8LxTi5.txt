Yeah

I've got a fucking curse
Wrapped in a problem
Hidden inside of my brain
And everywhere I look
Hidden in every thought
The ending is the same
I don't know if I can see the blue skies
When all I see is shrouded gray
And I don't care if I make you happy
Cause every day I'm living in pain
I am living in pain

I am thunder, I am rain
Just a human hurricane
Smashing everything that stands in front of me
(In front of me)
I'm the blood that's pouring out
I'm the kingdom burning down
And I am so afraid that nothing will ever change
(Nothing will ever change)

It's automatic negative sarcastic
It's got a hold of me, destroying everything
It doesn't care if you change the greatest things
Warping reality
It's running inside me
I can't see anymore
It's like the devil is pissed off burning inside me
I can't love anymore
Used up burnt out borderline psycho
(Fuck it)

I am thunder, I am rain
Just a human hurricane
Smashing everything that stands in front of me
(In front of me)
I'm the breath that's pouring out
I'm the kingdom burning down
And I am so afraid that nothing will ever change
(Nothing will ever change)

I feel the flames inside of me
And I taste the blood between my teeth
Buried my demons ten feet deep
But they still creep up to choke me out

I am thunder, I am rain
Just a human hurricane
Smashing everything that stands in front of me
(In front of me)
I'm the breath that's pouring out
I'm the kingdom burning down
And I am so afraid that nothing will ever change
(Nothing will ever change)

Nothing will ever change
Nothing will ever change
Nothing will ever change
(Nothing will ever change)
Nothing will ever change
Nothing will ever change
Nothing will ever change
