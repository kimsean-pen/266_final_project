We ain't even been talking for a minute yet
And now I already got you elevated
You don't know if I'm a sin or a sinner yet
But you already singing hella praises
If we're out for the night
And you're by by side
Don't get emotional
'Cause niggas gon' slide
Wit' you in my ride
So I'd rather let you know

Even though, I'm good without you
I'm fucking with you regardless
And if that's gon' hurt you
Least you can say is I'm honest
Good things don't always get to you the way that you want it
I'm good without you but I'm fucking with you regardless

So tell me if it gets too much
Tell me if you bit too much
Boy, act right 'cause it's cool if
There's too much sauce in the food for you
Sorry that you can't keep up
You're looking like you bit too much
Boy, act right 'cause it's cool if
There's too much sauce in the food for you
Too. much. sauce
I got too. much. sauce, sauce

Know not to pull up when you need it
I gotta know you can deal with it (stop)
Readin' through the lines, boy, you're showin' (stop)
Playin' with your mind, 'bout to blow it
It takes a strong man, strong shoulders
You gotta level up if you want this (stop)
Chewing with you mouth wide open
Like you. can't. see

Even though, I'm good without you
I'm fucking with you regardless
And if that's gon' hurt you
Least you can say is I'm honest
Good things don't always get to you the way that you want it
I'm good without you but I'm fucking with you regardless

So tell me if it gets too much
Tell me if you bit too much
Boy, act right 'cause it's cool if
There's too much sauce in the food for you (too. much)
Sorry that you can't keep up
You're looking like you bit too much
Boy, act right 'cause it's cool
There's too much sauce in the food for you
Too. much. sauce

Know what to do with it
You don't know what to do with it
I got too. much. sauce, sauce

Know what to do with it
You don't know what to do with it
Can't hang, can't hang with a boss

Know what to do with it
You don't know what to do with it
I got too. much. sauce, sauce

Know what to do with it
You don't know what to do with it
I got too. much. sauce, sauce

(Right, right, right, yeah, damn, right, right)
I got too. much. sauce, sauce

(Right, right, right, yeah, damn, right, right)
Can't hang, can't hang with a boss

(Right, right, right, yeah, damn, right, right)
I got too. much. sauce, sauce

(Right, right, right, yeah, damn, right, right)

L
Lust
Four letters like love but less precious
More like electric veins running fast than
frenzy my heart, make me crave and act reckless
So infectious
