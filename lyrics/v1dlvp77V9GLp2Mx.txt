Big cheese piling, you speed dialing
you talk shit, but I keep smiling
That's your chick, but not my chick
'Cause she got mileage
That's your head, but not my head
'Cause I drop knowledge
You glad when I never had shit but mad I got it

Niggas wanna turn their back (spine)
She don't wanna fuck no more (fine)
I'ma be that nigga some day (time)
Lost a couple friends along the way (crime)
Even in the end you could never end me
Still in the hood and I still sip tea
When I go in, I'ma go for the win
On point like syringe and it's like that
Living life full of sin, gotta cup full of Hen'
Put my tears in a pen and I write back
Ice pack cause' my heart lost
I'm so cold that I Jack Frost
I'm 'bout be on the upper echelon
Niggas gonna hate on the man that I become

Big cheese piling, you speed dialing
you talk shit, but I keep smiling
That's your chick, but not my chick
'Cause she got mileage
That's your head, but not my head
'Cause I drop knowledge
You glad when I never had shit but mad I got it

Niggas wanna take my life (stripes)
Police never read my rights (right)
Only wanna fuck me for the fame (hype)
Another rapper hit it in the same (night)
Niggas ain't shit and the hoes ain't loyal
Really gonna hate when they can't destroy you
Then expect the royal treatment
Talkin' slick like it's oil speakin'
Down to earth, 'til my soil weaken
Venomous words, watching the poison leakin'
Bandana on my motherfuckin' face
.38 on my motherfuckin' waist
When you see me better man up
Better make like a roller coaster put your hands up

Big cheese piling, you speed dialing
you talk shit, but I keep smiling
That's your chick, but not my chick,
'Cause she got mileage
That's your head, but not my head,
'Cause I drop knowledge

Mad I got it

Mad I got it

Hate the government, capital punishment
I keep a heater on my hip, don't need an oven mitt
I'm on some other shit, mind is twisted
I wear this mask every day, Stanley Ipkiss
Realistic views, a pessimistic blues
I sing along, who's got me on my crip shit
Lipstick, long kiss from the devil lips
Moonlit, two hits from the cannabis
Death knocking at my door, who could it be?
Life not sweet like suit wit' an E
Try to read me, would it be, Stephen King
Big cheese only bring me Misery
Insane with no brain, I'm low zane
No fame and no thangs is so strange
Do things that I don't see violent
Stick a nigga up because I'm mad he got it

Got it, got it
'Cause I'm mad he got it,
Got it
