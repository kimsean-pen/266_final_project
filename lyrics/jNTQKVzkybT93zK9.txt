I hide beneath the surface
Can't let you see the truth
Wear these false eyes to fool you
This pain's nothing new

Have I lost my mind (Under the surface)
(Under the surface)
Or have I found my way out

As everything falls away
I'm finally waking up
Been waiting for a change
I've been lost for long enough
I've wasted so much time
I'm done
Been waiting for a change
I've been lost for long enough

Feels like I'm close to breaking
These chains imprison me
Locked up, locked up
I can barely breathe

Have I lost my mind (Under the surface)
(Under the surface)
Or have I found my way out

As everything falls away
I'm finally waking up
Been waiting for a change
I've been lost for long enough
I've wasted so much time
I'm done
Been waiting for a change
I've been lost for long enough

Under the surface
Under the surface
Under the surface
Under the surface

As everything falls away
I'm finally waking up
Been waiting for a change
To lift me up

As everything falls away
I'm finally waking up
Been waiting for a change
I've been lost for long enough
I've wasted so much time
I'm done
Been waiting for a change
I've been lost for long enough
