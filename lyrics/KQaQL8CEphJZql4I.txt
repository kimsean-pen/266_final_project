Have you heard about the storm
That you filmed last time in your dream?
It will come in town again
Are we here?
Like a slave of moonlight miles
Can't pretend he needs morning sun
When another day is gone
We'll come out

Breaking the night sky
With music of my mind
I need a runway
Cause tender is the night

Breaking the night sky
I don't wanna feel the ground
And if you call me
My dream machine will fly

Have you seen these diamond ships?
They are touching night city's roofs
Are your pockets full of snow?
Will we moor?
Do you think these wings are mine?
Do you want to know how it feels?
Will we only watch and wait?
Oh, no, please!

Breaking the night sky
With music of my mind
I need a runway
Cause tender is the night

Breaking the night sky
I don't wanna feel the ground
And if you call me
My dream machine will fly
