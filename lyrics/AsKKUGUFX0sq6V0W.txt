Hang Tibetan paintings on my bedroom wall
Stick stars on the ceiling so I don't feel so small
God I wish I could call you, what the hell would I say?
Hope you're feeling better, we should hang out some day

Oh please
Don't you swallow
Pills like parma violets
Again

Once you showed me a secret dollar as a moth
It burely shivered, its wings were so soft
Then it flew up to the flourescent light
I knew right then that you would be alright

Oh please
Don't you swallow
Pills like parma violets
Again

Our lives are prisims the light beams through
Refracting colors is what we do
We're different shades of the same blue
But at least we're true, at least we're true

Oh please
Don't you swallow
Pills like parma violets
Again
