The avalanche
The afterthought
The passing day
The coming flood
You'll pull the thread
Against the grain
And see what was
Before it was

The morning clock
You wake me up
The howling room
The drinking from
Reacts into
Illusions of
The infamy
We started from

Do you obey?
You are a sign
You're seen together
But wait in line
While speaking of
The helpless cause
Collectible and so

And in this world
We're living in
I live like rain
You wear your skin
I walk alone
I stay alive
And risk my life
For what is mine

Oh, oh, oh, order
Do you know yourself
In the season of revealing
Oh, oh, oh, order
Is show and tell
Symmetry is so appealing
Oh, oh, oh, order
Do you know yourself
As the final act is nearing
Oh, oh, oh, order
Is just guesswork
Symmetry is so appealing

The accident
To video
We're insane
The afterglow
This single end
Upon his skin
The ending swole
That took him in

And my whole life
Is in that space
After the cut
Before the pain
I might as well
Believe that they
Received the world
And shy away

And why should I be overrun
Open my door to anyone
I saw you when you figured out
Hadn't moved aside, just didn't tell

Oh, oh, oh, order
Do you know yourself
In the season of revealing
Oh, oh, oh, order
Is show and tell
Symmetry is so appealing
Oh, oh, oh, order
Do you know yourself
As the final act is nearing
Oh, oh, oh, order
Is just guesswork
Symmetry is so appealing

Oh, oh, oh, order
Symmetry is so appealing
Oh, oh, oh, order
Symmetry is so appealing
