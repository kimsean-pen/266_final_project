It should have been you
It could have been you
It should have been you
It could have been you

When we first got together
We thought our love would stand the test
Waiting, oh, so long
Couldn't settle for second best
No one else could make me feel the way you do
Broke me heart in two
When you said our love was through

It should have been you
It could have been you
It should have been you
It could have been you

Through pain, tears and heartache
We see our love can't last
It's time for new beginnings
Can't live in the past

With my back to the wind
I face a new horizon
Believe me when I tell you it's true
Even though our love is through

It should have been you
It could have been you
It should have been you
It could have been you

It should have been you
It could have been you
It should have been you
It could have been you

It should have been you
It could have been you
It should have been you
It could have been you

It should have been you
I been searchin' such a long time
It could have been you
Wonder when I'll ever find
It should have been you
A man so warm and true
It could have been you
Who love me like you used to do

It should have been you
It could have been you
It should have been you
It could have been you

It should have been you
It could have been you
It should have been you
'Cause believe me when I tell you it's true
It could have been you
Even though our love is through

It should have been you
It could have been you
It should have been you
It could have been you
