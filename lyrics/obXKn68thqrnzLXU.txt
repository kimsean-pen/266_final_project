[Intro
Aye, aye, aye, aye

Henny in my veins I'm lit
Puffin' on a wood tip black with no way to get back to the way shit been
I am alive yet I can't seem to live
Aye, black mage on a bit of cocaine then I ate a th in Spokane
Trippin' like I got one shoe string and the other tied in a noose aye
Don't speak
Talk is cheap
Tie you up and make you leak
Blood all up on your sheets
You wished and now you receive
Lie in the way of me you might see
Skinny mothafucka remove all of your teeth
Use 'em for voodoo while you're fast asleep
Killin' me
In your dreams
I don't wanna get up
Everybody gotta washed up brain
Utter me a seance
Bring a deity to his knees when you utter my name
Aye, fuck fame I just wanna put your career in the grave
Knock-knock-knockin' on wood with a hammer and a metal nail sealin' your box up so you won't escape
Fuck
I'm in the darkest of places with nowhere to go but down
Question everything and never think that anyone got your back
What a bright light in the sky
You call it God and I call it a lie
Question everything and never think that anyone got your back
What a bright light in the sky
You call it God and I call it a lie
I see the way you watch me
You wish that I would just summon a Daemon to take you away
I've learned to love misery
Even in the blackest abyss you can find me and watch me decay
I see the way you watch me
You wish that I would just summon a Daemon to take you away
I've learned to love misery
Even in the blackest abyss you can find me and watch me decay
