Her voice cuts through the walls
Rings through everything that's hollow
These bitter words recall
All that's left and hard to swallow

She was always good for nothing when the good broke bad
All she's got to lose is everything she never had
Every back turned to her

We put her down in a shallow grave
She wears a dress like a body bag every day
And this way she won't have to run away
And she can keep her regrets at bay every day

Her blood runs hot to cold
Always breaking all she borrows
Her favours bought and sold
She lives like she's dead tomorrow

Just another reason looking for the next 'because'
Just another has been wishing that she never was
Every back turned to her

We put her down in a shallow grave
She wears a dress like a body bag every day
And this way she won't have to run away
And she can keep her regrets at bay every day

Tomorrow's not a new day
More time to think things through
As patience starts to fall away
A day can feel like two
When we gave her a new face
The past was out of view
She never fooled us because she could never fool herself

We put her down in a shallow grave
She wears a dress like a body bag every day
And this way she won't have to run away
And she can keep her regrets a bay every day
