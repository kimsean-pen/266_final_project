I try to forget
I try to go over
I try to accept that
Now you're gone

I slip through the dark
Don't have what to do
I wonder how hard
I'm wanting you

Don't you want me anymore
Thus i'm prisoner to my life
Without your love
There's no star up
But you are I and
I'm with your soul

I try to forget
I try to go on
I try to resempt it
And now you're gone

As up I'm for this
Can pass through the night
And all i am dressed is
Only me and the time

You don't want me anymore
Than this pants bordered
With a gun
Tears fall slow
In endless sky
You're dead and I am
With Myself

You are the
Maybe that's what happened
But at least they got him
