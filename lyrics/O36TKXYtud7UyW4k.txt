She doesn't care
Whether or not he's an island
And she doesn't care
Just as long as his ship's coming in
She doesn't care
Whether or not he's an island, oh no

They laugh, they make money
He's got a gold watch
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts
That bounce on his Italian leather sofa

She doesn't care
Whether or not he's a good man
She doesn't care
Just as long as she still has her friends, oh no
Yeah, she doesn't care
Whether or not he's an island

They laugh, they make money
He's got a gold watch
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts
That bounce on his Italian leather sofa

She's got a serrated edge
That she moves back and forth
It's such a simple machine
She doesn't have to use force
When she gets what she wants
She puts the rest on a tray in a zip-lock bag

She's got a serrated edge
That she moves back and forth
It's such a simple machine
She doesn't have to use force
When she get what she wants
She puts the rest on a tray in a zip-lock bag
In the freezer

Oh no, she doesn't care
Whether or not he's an island, oh no
She doesn't care
Just as long as his ship's coming in
(All right here it comes, here it comes)
She doesn't care
Whether or not he's an island, oh no

They laugh, they make money
He's got a gold watch
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts
That bounce on his Italian leather sofa
