All I've seen
Sharpened teeth in different colours all around me
It's so easy, so easy for me to be overwhelmed

Barefoot in snow
You had nowhere else to go
And I've been focusing voices in the wind
Don't let her in

Now your bright and blinding light begins to fade
Lose your colour
Become shade

I know you for what you are
What you've seen and what you've been through
I can't excuse you but now I understand
You are sick, you are proud, and you are never backing down

The ripples break and blur, disturb the water
Be still again

Barefoot in snow
You had nowhere else to go
And I've been focusing voices in the wind
Don't let her in

I'm sick of thinking about this
It's no longer constructive
I'm sick of thinking about you

Barefoot in snow
You had nowhere else to go

Barefoot in snow
You had nowhere else to go
And I've been focusing on forgetting
This is the end
