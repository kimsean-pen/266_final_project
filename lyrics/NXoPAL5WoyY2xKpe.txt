Carry your hearts
Carry your minds
Bring us to the finish line
Free your soul (before we displace)
Bring us to the finish line

This is all too much before
The end of the hallway with an open door
Come in
Come in
Be safe here
Come in
Come in
And just escape

Escape
Escape
From all the pain
Delay
Delay
Delay all of your change

You'll never be who you want to be
You have too much insecurity

This is it
This is it
This is it
This is it
This is your life now
This is it
This is it
This is it
This is it

Don't be confused by who's singing to you

Carry your hearts
Carry your minds
Bring us to the finish line
Free your soul (before we displace)
Bring us to the finish line

Therapeutic medicine
Therapeutic life of sin
Therapeutic medicine
Therapeutic life of sin
Sin
Sin

We will never understand
You can't destroy our head
But that doesn't mean we have to be separated

This is it
This is it
This is it
This is it
This is your freedom
This is it
This is it
This is it
This is it

What have I been doing?
