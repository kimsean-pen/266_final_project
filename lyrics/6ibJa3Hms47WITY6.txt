Tendons and muscles of steel.
and the blaze of lightning in its eyes.
white as the snow on the hills.
and it's reins, that i hold, they are mine.
This stallion and sword in exchange
for my heart and both of my eyes.
the ravens of swift wings my sight

Eight legged stallion of mine.
run with the speed of the winds.
eight legged stallion i stride.
run as if you carried wings.
I paint thee with the blood from my veins
images of origin long lost.
i adorn your white mane and tail
with the stars that fell from the sky.
A glade in the eternal deep dark woods...
midnight hours...
