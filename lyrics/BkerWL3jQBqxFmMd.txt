Oooth hooo-if I could do it all over again
Oooth hoo hoo-I'd be in the same skin I'm in
The clothes I wear and the things they dare me to do

Oooh hoooo hoo-the places I go
Ohooo hout and the people I know
The things I gain oooh Sometime they rain on me
Hay aaeee skin I'm in
Hay-a and the things I never never win
