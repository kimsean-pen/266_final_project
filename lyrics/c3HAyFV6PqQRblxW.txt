Necessary but against your better judgment
You were being overcharged in the market square
Overwhelmed and it's coming from all angles
You were entertaining the idea that it wasn't fair

But the picture seemed sharp enough to view life through you
I can't remember where we were, where were we when we all went under?

You don't have to say sorry
For all the things you failed to do
You don't have to say sorry
For all the times when everything fell through

Say it's sponsored character assassination
I promise that I'd burned your things when you're dead and gone
It's an orchestrated controversy
No strategies for dissolving in the atmosphere

And the distance seemed short enough from Point A to Point B
Your favourite feeling was the ground falling out from beneath your feet

You don't have to say sorry
For all the things you failed to do
You don't need to say sorry
For all the times when everything fell through

Our loneliness
Arrives by satellite
On time
And the signal
A malady's between
Both sides

You couldn't be
Whatever they call me
Insane
Left here with no
No one familiar
Recede

Erasing
Your memory (Your memory)
Erasing
Your memory (Your memory)

Our particles
Collide and drown
By candlelight
Our particles
Collide and drown
By candlelight
