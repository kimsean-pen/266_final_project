You said I know that I want it and I live like I love it
But when I'm sad the changes
When I want some peace or truth
I'm constantly assailed, assailed

And I've wanted, wanted
WAITED, WAITED
Wanted love deferred
But I won't stay
No, you never say that's what you wanted
WHEN YOU WANT IT

And I never talked you when I was sad about it
I don't wanna wait until the dawn
And tell myself I'll learn by morning
But I NEVER LISTEN to myself and I never said one word about it

But changes come and changes how I look upon myself
Yeah, you could live happily and gone to somewhere else
Someone else, but who will stand for me if you weren't sad and there?
I said it will never be, won't never be that brave

But talking I was different, this morning light
It's more like waiting for the time to steal away
Now I see your face in everything, I make a song, make a song
Sing it always â€˜cause

You never said just what you wanted when you wanted
I never told you when I was sad about it
I don't wanna wait until the dawn and tell myself I'll learn by morning
But I NEVER LISTEN to myself and I never said one word about it

So I know that I want it, know the soon as I got it
But the change, I hate it
The time I see some proof, oh God, I want that one to beg
I want that chase, want that bad

And I know it's lame, this basic job, I'm so obsessed
Yeah, I know it's so absurd
But when I love it, I love it
All I want is that loving, girl

You know I won't stay
BUT I WON'T STAY
No, but I won't stay
No, you can never say just what you want when I want you

You never said just what you wanted when you wanted
And I never talked to you when I was sad about it
I don't wanna wait until the dawn and tell myself I'll learn by morning
And I NEVER LISTEN to myself but never say one word about it
