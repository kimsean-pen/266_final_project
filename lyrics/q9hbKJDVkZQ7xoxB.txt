There... there's a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue

And it's my mind
And there's no time
When I'm alone

I think of you
And things you do
Go round my head
The things you said
Like I love only you
In my mind there is no sorow

Don't you know that is so?
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that is so?
There... there's a place

Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind

And there's no time
When I'm alone
There's a place
There's a place
There's a place
There's a place
