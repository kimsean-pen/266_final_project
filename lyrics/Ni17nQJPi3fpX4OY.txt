Well I heard enough and I've seen enough
And I know enough to know.
I know a good thing when I see it
And it's a bad thing to let go.
Well I've been around, I've been up and down,
Until I bent out of control.
With your world all in motion
It's gotta put a ball and chain on your soul.

All those angels running,
Picking up the pieces,
Putting back together hearts broke long ago.
I know a good thing when I see it
And it's a bad thing to let go.

There will always be lovers
With borders of their own.
And you may charge across in a golden chariot,
But you will never be at home.
'Cause I have dreams like distant thunder.
I have hope like a prayer unheard.
This is nothin' less than perfect
In a less-than-perfect world.

All those angels running,
Picking up the pieces,
Putting back together hearts broke long ago.
I know a good thing when I see it
And it's a bad thing to let go.

All those angels running,
Picking up the pieces,
Putting back together hearts broke long ago.
I know a good thing when I see it
And it's a bad thing to let go.
It's a bad thing to let go.
It's a bad thing.
