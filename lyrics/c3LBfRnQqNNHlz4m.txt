With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever get from you
Is sorrow, sorrow

You're actin' funny spendin' all my money
You're out there playin' your high class games
Sorrow, sorrow

You never do what you know you oughta
Somethin' tells me you're the devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow
Ah, ah, ah

I tried to fight her but I can't resist her
(I tried to fight her but I can't resist her)
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow, sorrow

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
(With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue)
The only thing I ever got from you
Was sorrow, sorrow
Ah, ah, ah

With your long blonde hair I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair
