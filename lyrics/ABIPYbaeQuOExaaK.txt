We're thick as thieves, I'm on my knees
My heart moves in a way I can't explain
I tell your friends, but burn sheets
I couldn't care less if I'm never seen again

But she won't come lightly
Beautiful agony
You know what it's stopping once it starts
And once the fume gets lit
You know you're in for it
Every clench is like a dagger through my heart

I want you to love me
I want you
To trust me
In the bottoms of your heart
And never be apart
No names, no doubt
Get in and get out

We're thick as thieves, no sleep
You won't believe a thing that I've heard
And no, there's nothing wrong with me
And I saw death of the skirts of the world now

She won't come lightly
Beautiful agony
You know what it's stopping once it starts
And once the fume gets lit
Nothing's gonna come of it
And every clench is like a dagger through my heart

I want you to love me
I want you
To trust me
In the bottoms of your heart
And never be apart
No names, no doubt
Get in and get out

You know what you bringing out?
Get in and get out
The ponytail swinging out
Get in and get out
You know what you bringing out?
Get in and get out
The ponytail swinging out
I want you to love me

I want you to trust me
I want you to trust me (Fleming: Get in and get out)
I want you to trust me (Fleming: Get in and get out)
