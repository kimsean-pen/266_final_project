You take me so high, you take me so high
You take me so high, you take me so high
You take me so high, you take me so high
You take me so high, you take me so high

Hello, do you miss me? I don't know
My soul, miss you, baby, you don't know
Right now I am dreaming about how we love
We love

I need you on and on and on in my life
I need you on and on and on in my life

I need you on and on and on in my life
On and on and on in my life

You take me higher
(You take me so high, you take me so high)
(You take me so high, you take me so high)
'Cause you're my fire
(You take me so high, you take me so high)
(You take me so high, you take me so high)

You take me higher
(You take me so high, you take me so high)
(You take me so high, you take me so high)
'Cause you're my fire
(You take me so high, you take me so high)
(You take me so high, you take me so high)

I need you on and on and on in my life
On and on and on in my life
I need you on and on and on in my life
On and on and on in my life
