Let's get the story straight
You were a poison
You flooded through my veins
You left me broken
You tried to make me think
That the blame was all on me
With the pain you put me through
And now I know that

It's not me, it's you, it's not me, it's you
Always has been you
All the lies and stupid things
You say and do, it's you
It's not me, it's you
All the lies and pain you put me through

I know that it's not me, it's you, you, you

It's not me, it's you, you

So here we go again

The same fight we're always in

I don't care so why pretend?
Wake me when your lecture ends
You tried to make me small
Make me fall and it's all your fault

With the pain you put me through
And now I know that
It's not me, it's you, it's not me, it's you
Always has been you

All the lies and stupid things
You say and do, it's you
It's not me, it's you
All the lies and pain you put me through
I know that it's not me, it's you
Let's get the story straight
You were a poison flooding through my veins
You're driving me insane
And now you're gone away
I'm no longer choking
From the pain you put me through
And now I know that
It's not me, it's you, you, it's not me, it's you
Always has been you
All the lies and stupid things
You say and do, it's you
It's not me, it's you
All the lies and pain you put me through
I know that it's not me, it's you, you, you
(It's not me, it's you)
It's not me, it's you, you
(It's not me, it's you)
It's not me, it's you, you
(It's not me, it's you)
It's not me, it's you, you
(It's not me, it's you)
It's not me, it's you
