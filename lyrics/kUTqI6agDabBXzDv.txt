One of the first gigs I ever played, out of all places,
Was at my brother's fraternity house in Norman
For some philanthropy event
And, you see, my 12 year old self at the time
Decided to go on stage and intro one of the ballads by saying
This is for all the people who have fucked me over
At 12 years old, I can only imagine how long that list was.

And after the show, my mom pulled me aside with, like
True Catholic anger in her eyes, red in the face
You know, whole nine yards
And she said:
Listen, men don't talk like that, boys do
And I'm raising you to be a man
And of course she was right
And I think I hated most that I disappointed her

She stopped smoking the year I was born
But any time I think of that story
I always picture her with a Virginia Slim in her hand
It was her favorite smoke.
