Nine months since I licked you clean and left with no complaints.
I jump blindly into your arms, I'd never been so brave.
And each day brings a storm I'm simple not prepared to face.
And I sleep and I dream between my grave and your sweet face.

But I've been waiting, waiting

Momma blessed me with confidence I'm distant to embrace.
Well feed me something that's strong enough to burn this sorry place.
I'm fucking losing my mind and I can see it in my face

But I've been waiting, waiting
But I'm waiting, waiting
But I'm waiting, waiting
But I'm waiting, waiting
But I'm waiting.
