Orlandon't tell me, oh no.
Don't say, oh God don't tell me.
Oh dear me, heavens above.
Oh no, no I can't stand it.

Stop please, oh deary me.
What in heaven's name?
Oh blimey. Mercy me. Woe are we.
Oh dear. Oh stop it, stop it.

(repeat previous lines backwards)

You've been so kind,
I know, I know.
So why did I hurt you?
I didn't mean to hurt you.

But I'll keep trying,
and I'm sure you will too.

I want it. I want it. I want it. Give it to me.
I give it you back when I finish the lunchtea.
I lie in the road, try to trip up the passing cars.
Yes, me and the hedgehog, we bursting the tyres all day
as we roll down the highway towards the setting sun.
