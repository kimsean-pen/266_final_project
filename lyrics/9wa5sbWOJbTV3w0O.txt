What remains of us?
What remains of us?
What remains of us?
What remains of us, us, us?

Is this all there is
Or am I blind to it?
I tried to open up
I'm, I'm nothing

What remains of us?
What remains of us?
What remains of us?
What remains of us, us, us?

These ruins give out
Do they give too?
Something men were, something men were
And were we, were we living?

What remains of us?
What remains of us?
What remains of us?
What remains of us, us, us?
