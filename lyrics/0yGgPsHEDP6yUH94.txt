and if you fly into the sky

and if your body is a penny and dime
ready to throw it in the fountain of my many monies
and if you push it I will take you offline
philosophize in it! Chemicalize with it!

I fell in love you the only way I know
I went for many miles until I couldn't go
concerned but anyways,
I didn't even know about you and me

I made a guess about your craziness and no
I didn't think about how many boys you've been with before
concerned but anyways
I love everything about you

and if your body is a penny and dime
ready to throw it in the fountain of my many monies
and if you push it I will take you offline
Philosophize in it! Chemicalize!

Picture our wedding it'd be summer sour and summer sweet
we'd paint the ceiling red, we'd go to the Greek and straight to the street
concerned but never bleak
we'd find the day about you and me
and with our eyes we shall see

between you and me
who's crazier for the other one? it's me... it's you... it's me... it's you...

and if your body is a penny and dime
ready to throw it in the fountain of my many monies
and if you push it I will take you offline
philosophize in it! Chemicalize with it!
