Look out from your window now
Can you see me cheering for you, up and down?
I holler across the park, I'm waving these leaves
I miss my far- flung heart

All I cannot say I hope you know
All you cannot say I hope I can hear

Then holler across these miles
We will the same snow, starting the same time
Not easy to find a friend
And places we've been, now different scenes again

All I cannot say I hope you know
All you cannot say I hope I can hear
