Hands change like the weather to prepare in a sweater.
Either way you'll be cold if it snows.
Everybody wonders where to get the answer,
Silly thought to think the answer knows where to go.

The push up thought used to seem like a really good idea.
But service as better leave enough alone.

Not everyone believes the story, as for me I love the truth.
And ever since I was a young girl.
Witnessed evidence and proof.

I'm standing in the middle of some other persons life
The funny thing about that is I'm these are lies
I don't where I'm going
Quite a story where I been
The map seems all wrong and my compass says the end.

If it's already written then my script can be forgiven.
Doesn't matter where I thought I'd be
Time to relish where I've been.

Not everyone believes the story, as for me I love the truth.
And ever since I was a young girl.
Witnessed evidence and proof.

Been given the morning, every dawn brings thoughts of you.
By this time tomorrow I'll be brand new.
Been given the morning,
If you catch me tomorrow I'll be renewed
Been given the morning
Been given the morning
Been given the morning
Been given the morning
Been given the morning
Been given the morning
Been given the morning
(Thoughts of you)

Been given the morning, every dawn brings thoughts of you.
By this time tomorrow I'll be brand new.
