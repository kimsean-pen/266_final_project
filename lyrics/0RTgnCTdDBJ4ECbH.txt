Happy Birthday, dear Paul
Older once again
Read it on the wall
Compare myself to friends
Happy news is you
Lazy, unglued
Fills selfish grooves
Compare myself to lose

If life's a dream, then I'm not sleeping, I'm not sleeping in
Slow to speech
The pace is thickening, space is sickening feel
And I'm a freak
But look at me no signs what you're missing

Faster news to you
Nothing to do
No one to be
Bite with no teeth
All the lives we lived
And all the lives to be
Are full of trees, changing leaves

If life's a dream, then I'm not sleeping, I'm not sleeping in
Slow to speech
The pace is thickening, space is sickening feel
And I'm a freak
But look at me no signs of what you're missing

Be a sweeter daughter
An honest father
A stronger brother

Be a selfless mother
A selfish lover
A mindless hunter
