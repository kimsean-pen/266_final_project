Does it ever cross your mind?
When it's summer in July
When it's quiet
And you find a little time
Does it ever cross your mind?

Are you so much older now?
Your children playing in the street
With their castles
And cowboys and make believe
Does it ever cross your mind?
Does it ever cross your mind?

Driving through this town
And I remember how it feels
But do I ever cross your mind?
Sometimes
