Today there was a tragedy
Underneath the bridge
A man walked cold and blue into lament
The sky coloured perfect
As the man slipped away
Waving with a last vanilla smile
Waving with a last vanilla smile
Somewhere at a table
Two drowned fools
Smoking, drinking water as they talked
Of how they loved our lady
And oh, the smell as candles die
One more ice cream river body
Flowed underneath the bridge

Underneath the bridge
As the river flowed, one more ice cream body
Flowed underneath the bridge
Underneath the bridge
