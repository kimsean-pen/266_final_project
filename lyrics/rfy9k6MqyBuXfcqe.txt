Yeah!

Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight, yeah

(You don't waste no time at all)
Don't hear the bell, but you answer the call
(It comes to you as to us all)
Yeah, we're just waiting for the hammer to fall, yeah

Ev'ry night and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face the western way
Build your muscles as your body decays, yeah

(Toe your line and play their game)
Yeah, let the anaesthetic cover it all
('Til one day they call your name)
You know it's time for the hammer to fall

Rich or poor or famous
For your truth, it's all the same (oh, no, oh, no)
Lock your door, but the rain is pouring
Through your window pane (oh, no)
Baby, now your struggle's all in vain

For we, who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder

(What the hell we fighting for?)
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
(You just got time to say your prayers)
While your waiting for the hammer to, hammer to fall

Hey, yes
It's gonna fall
Hammer, you know, yeah, hammer to fall

While you're waiting for the hammer to fall
Give it to me one more time!
