Rollercoaster ride in the fast lane
Got the roof down
Kiss me hard in the rain
You got the candy colored eyes
Pink and gold chain
Million dollar babe
Whip it out, like I'm propane

You're on my mind
I'm feeling kinda nervous, but I like it
Take my t-shirt off and do it right
You're on my mind
The feeling, like an astronaut
Watchin' the world all alone, just you and I
(Beautiful)

Rollercoaster ride in the fast lane
Got the roof down
Kiss me hard in the pourin' rain
Yeah, I can see it in your eyes
Know you feel the same
Million dollar babe
Trippin' on it, like propane
(Beautiful)

Lock it, lock it, lock-ck it, lock it, lock it

Lock it, lock it, lock-ck it, lock it, lock it

Lock it, lock it, lock-ck it
Got the key can you unlock it?

Caught in a liplock when we pitstop
Cosmic kiss tastes like cherry maraschino
Ride passenger seat, tropical heat
Eyes so red, you could be my Valentino, yeah
If you want my heart then don't you drop it
(Want my heart then don't you drop it)
I'm right here, right in your pocket
(I'm right here, right in your pocket)
Don't you drop it, never stop it
(Never stop it)
If you want my love (my love), try to unlock it

Rollercoaster ride in the fast lane
Got the roof down
Kiss me hard in the pourin' rain
Yeah, I can see it in your eyes
Know you feel the same
Million dollar babe
Trippin' on it, like propane

Make you hit them high notes like you a tenor
Big appetite, girl you my dinner
I know they could do you but I could do it better

Unlock your clothes off your body
Give you lovin', yeah (let's get it)
'Cause that's how we do (that's how we do)
You wantin' me too (wantin' me too)
You got me see-through

We on the surfboard, yeah, we ridin' waves
Let's get it going girl, let's andale
Let's andale, sip this champagne
