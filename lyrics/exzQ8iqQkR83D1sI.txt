Shocked Orwellian races
Gather united in grief
Nothing is left from the world they have known
Grotesque indifferent belief
Systems have failed
Rules can't control
Corrupt dictators forever dethroned
Lies of the priest
Trust of the blind
Failure of structures manipulate deviant crimes

All nations hail the end of peace
New dawn inception of disease
Age of revenge has now been born
By the mother of all wars

Enemy of god
Purity and innocence is killed
Enemy of god
Peace has died the day when life stood still

Clash of demonic religions
Hatred the human divine
Despotic aggressors in triumph they reign
Fanatics bring mayhem to life
War of all wars
Foreseen before
Freedom's foundations exist no more
A genocide nightmare the darkest of days
Chaos devourers as all hope and pride fades

Total carnage sudden death
Sent from a morbid mind possessed
A godless Mekka now awaits, as hellish flames desecrates

Enemy of god
Purity and innocence is killed
Enemy of god
Peace has died the day when life stood still

Now the fury is unleashed
The hunter has become prey for the beast
Breathing savage distain
Malevolence ingrained
No emotion for humanity
Tragically the palace falls
Burned are the imperators halls
For their decadent facades
All their elitaire
Exhibition of filth to watch for all

For those who die along the way
Timeless glory awaits

For those who die along the way
Timeless glory awaits

Enemy of god
Purity and innocence is killed
Enemy of god
Peace has died the day when life stood still

Nothing can divide
Terror is thy name
Last legion alive
Set the world aflame
Enemy of god
Masters you have none
Sweet the victory
When thy kingdom come
Enemy of god
Cast deliverance
Fanatical divide
Slaying innocence
Enemy of god
Answer to no one
Bringing war from heaven
A thousand fires burn
A thousand fires burn
