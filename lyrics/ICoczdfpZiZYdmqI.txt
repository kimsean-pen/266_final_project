When we first met
I was surprised to get
That feelin'
That feelin'
The kind that don't wash away with soap
So sweet to me
Ooh
The kind of feelin' I need
To get me through my darkest days
For you I prayed

What you do is crazy babe
Not like you belong in an asylum
Crazy babe
Like the sun in the morning
And the moon at night
Like the rain fallin' from the sky
Like the trees growin' from the ground
I'm astounded babe
By your love for me
And your touchin' me
And your trust in me
Like you do whoo whoo whoo

Even now, I still feel that feelin'
Although we've grown
We're still on the same side
Of the proverbial road
Heading in the same direction
I'm so glad to know
With you I spend my time

What you do is crazy babe
Not like you belong in an asylum
Crazy babe
Like the sun in the morning
And the moon at night
Like the rain fallin' from the sky
Like the trees growin' from the ground
I'm astounded babe
By your love for me
And your touchin' me
And your trust in me
Like you do whoo whoo whoo

What you do is crazy babe
Not like you belong in an asylum
Crazy babe
Like the sun in the morning
And the moon at night
Like the rain fallin' from the sky
Like the trees growin' from the ground
I'm astounded babe
By your love for me
And your touchin' me
And your trust in me
Like you do whoo whoo whoo

What you do is crazy babe
Not like you belong in an asylum
Crazy babe
Like the sun in the morning
And the moon at night
Like the rain fallin' from the sky
Like the trees growin' from the ground
I'm astounded babe
By your love for me
And your touchin' me
And your trust in me
Like you do whoo whoo whoo

What you do is crazy babe
Not like you belong in an asylum
Crazy babe
Like the sun in the morning
The moon at night
Like the rain fallin' from the sky
Like the trees growin' from the ground
I'm astounded babe
By your love for me
And your touchin' me
And your trust in me
Like you do whoo whoo whoo
Crazy baby
