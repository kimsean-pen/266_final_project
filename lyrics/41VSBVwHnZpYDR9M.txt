Feel the bile churning away
Mold the substance
To send through the gate

Cosmic seas of fire traverse the void of space
Bringing human souls from another world
Manipulate the species from inside
Watch them fight and kill
To build the mega-cemetery urns of the planet
In this lachrymose universe
Of anfractuous dimensions

No death as known...
Only doorways...

You are the stargate
