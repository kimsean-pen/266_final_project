Dressed in sparks and light
Showered in the dazzling white
We are the children of the sun
But nightfall is about to come

The sky turns red
A frightful sign
So we run
We're running out of time
Because

We live only one day
We only live one day
We are in heaven but we can't stay
We live only one day

Daylight counting hours
Worshipped by the flowers
Related to mars and moon
But the night is coming soon

Sky turns red
A frightful sign
So we run
We're running out of time
Because

We live only one day
We only live one day
We are in heaven but we can't stay
We live only one day

And when we die
No place to stay
We are in heaven anyway
We have to go, the sky's in flames
We're going down in purple rain
Purple rain

We live only one day
We only live one day
We are in heaven but we can't stay
We live only one day

And when we die
No place to stay
We are in heaven anyway
And after all the night arrives
Darkness comes and eats us
Eats us alive
