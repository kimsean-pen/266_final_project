House on fire windows broke
Circle dancing clouds of smoke
Got my earrings and the gold
Got that tan skin deep in code
Tell me what you think about a way
Hey, that will let you party every day
Say, running houses where the party stays the same
It's crazy
Always on the run dickri-dam
That's the life we want dickri-dam
You can like it or not dickri-dam
We're the party monsters
Shukar shukar
Shukar shukar
Play our music really loud
They'll come running from all around
Moonlight dancing mystic scene
I'm you're dreamy gipsy queen
Tell me what you think about a way
That will let you party every day
Running houses where the party stays the same
It's crazy
Tell me what you think about a way
That will let you party every day
Running houses where the party stays the same.
It's crazy
Always on the run dickri-dam
That's the life we want dickri-dam
You can like it or not dickri-dam
We're the party monsters
Shukar shukar

Hey there boys see you looking at me
Checking me out do you like what you see
Stay up all night want to join the party
If you got what you need to party with a gipsy
Hey there boys see you looking at me
Checking me out do you like what you see
Stay up all night want to join the party
If you got what you need to party with a gipsy

We're the party monsters
Always on the run dickri-dam
That's the life we want dickri-dam
You can like it or not dickri-dam
We're the party monsters
