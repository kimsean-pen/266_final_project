You gave your line
You fell in love
You feel the shadow
There's no more to borrow
There's no more to steal
And no more to feel
I know I know I know
I know I know I know
I know I know I know
You fell in line
You fell in jail
You feel in the shadow
To live in the light
To die in the night
I don't want to push it
I know I know I know
I know I know I know
I know I know I know
