I've been lookin' for someone
Who sells truth by the pound
Then I saw the dealer and his friend
Arrive, but their gifts looked grim

Now I'm tired of hanging on,
Waitin' for a showdown
Don't y'see I gotta ride 'em out
Cuz the pearl's just around the bend

Beautiful pearl, oh when will you reappear?
Mysteries unfurl and become so clear,
When I feel you near...

I found a way outside myself
To make my spirit climb,
And I coulda shinnied on up
But my rope was made of wind

I appreciate the words,
But I won't be there at showtime
Don't y'see I gotta ride them out
Cuz the pearl's just around the bend

Beautiful pearl, oh when will you reappear?
Mysteries unfurl and become so clear,
When I feel you near...

When my backyard weeds grew high,
I hoped that they would hide me,
But I felt that the pearl was near
Cuz I thought I saw it shine

I was lookin' all around
When I felt it there inside me
And I see a possibility
That it's been there all the time...
