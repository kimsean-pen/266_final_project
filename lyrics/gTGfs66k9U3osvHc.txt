Paradise [x8]

We are the Paradise People
We are the moon and the stars
We are the church and the steeple
Sent down from Venus and Mars

We are the Paradise People (oh yes we are)
We are the moon and the stars (moon and the stars)
We are the church and the steeple (yes we are)
Sent down from Venus and Mars

We won't expose the guile
And we won't need to
It shall avow itself to you
Ear to the ground and head in the clouds

The same moon in the sky
that reflects light
Is the same moon that pulls the tide
Do you know who you are?

We are the Paradise People (Paradise People)
We are the moon and the stars (moon and the stars)
We are the church and the steeple
Sent down from Venus and Mars

We are the Paradise People (Paradise People)
We are the moon and the stars (we are the moon and the stars)
We are the church and the steeple (we're gonna hold you up tonight)
Sent down from Venus and Mars

We the people of Paradise
We can no longer hide in the night
We must bring these secrets we've learned
Into the light

Into the light [x8]

(We are) We are the Paradise People
We are the moon and the stars (we are we are)
We are the church and the steeple (we're gonna hold you up tonight)
Sent down from Venus and Mars

We are the Paradise People (we are the people)
We are the moon and the stars (we are the moon and stars)
We are the church and the steeple (church and the steeple)
Sent down from Venus and Mars

We are the moon and stars
The church and steeple (church and the steeple)
We are the people
We are the moon and stars
Forever and ever
