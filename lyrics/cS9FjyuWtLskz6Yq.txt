Eleven saintly shrouded men
silhouettes stand against the sky
one in front with a cross held high
come to wash my sins away

Standing alone in the wind and rain
feeling the fear that is growing
Sensing the change in the tide again
caught by the storm that is brewing
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
some of the doubt in the things you believe
Now that your faith will be put to the test
nothing to do but await what is coming
Why is then God still protecting me
even when I don't deserve it?
Though I am blessed with an inner strength
some they would call it a penance
Why am I meant to face this alone
asking the question time and again
Praying to God won't keep me alive
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise...

They'll be saving their prayers when the moment comes
there'll be penance to pay when it's judgement day
And the guilty'll bleed when that moment comes
they'll be coming to claim, take your soul away

The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross

They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame
They'll be bringing us all immortality
Holding comunion so the world be blessed
my creator, my God, lay my soul to rest

The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross

The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
The sign of the cross
Lost the love of heaven above
Chose the lust of the earth below
Eleven saintly shrouded men
Came to wash my sins away
