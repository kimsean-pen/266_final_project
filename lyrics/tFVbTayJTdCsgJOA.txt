he was an archangel of love
he had good news
for those dedicating their lives
to the spirit

one love was the focus of
the true message
everybody felt the tension
time was fading

gabriel playin

dancin soon became a way
to communicate
feel the music deep in your soul
gabriel playin, playin
hold on, hold on

gabriel playin

those that stand aside and watch
the soul movin, groovin, movin, groovin
stand, clap your hands be the one to show
your love, overflowin, overflowin

gabriel playin

just release your soul to the love
that's holding you
that's consoling you
you're right dancing
wear it, to be alive (?)
feelin so right
clap your hands

gabriel playin
