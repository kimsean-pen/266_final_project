Met a girl, fell in love
Glad as I can be
Met a girl, fell in love
Glad as I can be
But I think all the time
Is she true to me?
'Cause there's nothin' in this world
To stop me worryin' 'bout that girl

I found out I was wrong
She was just two timin'
I found out I was wrong
She just kept on lyin'
Now she tries to tell the truth
And I just can't believe
'Cause there's nothin' in this world
To stop me worryin' 'bout that girl

Tell me who can I turn to
Just who can I believe?
Tried to put her out of my mind
She'll only cause me grief
But I love that girl, whatever she's done
You know, it hurts me deeply
'Cause there's nothin' in this world
To stop me worryin' 'bout that girl

I know, she's been with other fellas
Why she keep on lyin'?
It hurts me so when she says nothin'
I really feel like dyin'
I ache inside until I think
I know, it's just my pride
'Cause there's nothin' in this world
To stop me worryin' 'bout that girl
'Cause there's nothin' in this world
To stop me worryin' 'bout that girl
