I've been sucked in, how much do you think
That I'll get away with
Push me and pull me, baby's out with the bath
I don't know who to stay with
There's nothing more that I can do,
Worms in a can just me and you
Can't turn away, burning bridges today,
It's a crime, it's a shame
Nobody left to blame,
Nobody left to blame,
Nobody
Eat my cake, I don't care what's at stake,
I'm swinging like Tarzan
I can't sleep, shadows run deep,
My right's caught in my left hand
There's nothing more that I can do,
Worms in a can just me and you
Can't turn away burning bridges today
It's a crime, it's a shame
Nobody left to blame
I've come undone stuck under the gun,
You know the truth is demanding
Bark at the moon, the end comes too soon,
There's only one man standing
I don't care, I don't know
There's nothing more that I can do
Call it a day just passing through
Shaken the sound, lost on the ground
It's a crime, it's a shame
Nobody left to blame
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody left to blame
I feel so down, have to get away, nobody
