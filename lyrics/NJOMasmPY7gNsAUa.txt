From the corner of your eye
Down to the trap you set tonight
To give in all things that you need
To give you so much you can't breathe

I know the past is a lonely place
In a given time you could find what you couldn't replace
Don't pretend I get up in a tree
The future's not where it used to be

It's so electric if we're pretending to
At ... we don't know what to do
TO understand it, of where it's headed to
Like we don't know what to do

We could fall
Or we could just stay still
And the times will go
We could fall

As I defended your deny
I can't tell what you like
It's just the thought to ...
Let's go outside so we can breathe

I know the past is a lonely place
And now you wake in a bed where it's no one to face
Don't pretend I get up in a tree
The future's not where it used to be

It's so electric if we're pretending to
At ... we don't know what to do
TO understand it, of where it's headed to
Like we don't know what to do

We could fall
Or we could just stay still
And the times will go
We could fall
