Guys like me
Like girls like you
And girls like you
Like guys like me (you know)

I blaze the night
In Harbor lights
You dressing light
It's fitting right
I hear the waves
I see you wave
I'm staying put
You say "no way"

The track begins
You pull me in
I touch your skin
You trembling
It's in your eyes
You're here to win
So let the game, games begin

I, I, I, I
Wanna see
You, you, you, you
Telling me
That, that
That you got what I need
Do pretty girl
Don't speak

Baby, show me
By the way you hold me
Way that you control me
Speed me up, or slow me

Oh, when I'm lonely
Full of stormy weather
Can you make it better
I heard what you told me
So, oh, oh show me

Know what you want
My number for
Ain't talked enough
Let's talk some more
You kinda cute
Don't hit the mute
Just aim and shoot
Or get the boot

I, I, I, I
Wanna see
You, you, you, you
Telling me
That, that
That you got what I need
Do pretty girl
Don't speak

Baby, show me
By the way you hold me
Way that you control me
Speed me up, or slow me

Oh, when I'm lonely
Full of stormy weather
Can you make it better
I heard what you told me
So, oh oh show me

And girls like you

Guys like me
Like girls like you

Baby, show me
By the way you hold me
Way that you control me
Speed me up, or slow me

Oh, when I'm lonely
Full of stormy weather
Can you make it better

So, oh oh show me

Oh, when I'm lonely
Full of stormy weather
