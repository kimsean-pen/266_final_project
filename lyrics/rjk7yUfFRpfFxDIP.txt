Say I ain't feel it comin' on
My face is numb and I can completely
Say this without slurring all night long
Said I think I'm done but I'd take one more if you pourin' up
(And you look just like me ooh, woo)
Smiling for nothing
You sippin' somethin', girl I can tell
(Say I don't know what this gon' be)
But I'm here for a good time and the bottom line, is this right here

I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to
Tell me something
I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to
Tell me something
Girl, I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to
Tell me something
Girl, I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to
Tell me something, girl

Ah, say it, say it again
I'm gon' say it again, girl
Say it, say it, say it again
I'm gon' say it again, ay

Baby I know what your song is (your song is)
When the DJ playin' you be in your moment (in your moment)
Put it on me baby, watchin' you whinin' your hips
Wonderin' if, you're goin' home or comin' with me after this,
(And you look just like me, mmm)
You got your eyes closed, we dancin' so slow just like that
(Said I don't know what this gon' be)
But if you're here for a good time and that's the bottom line
Sing this here

I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to
Tell me something
I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to
Tell me something
Girl, I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to
Tell me something
Girl, like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to
Tell me something, girl

I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to
Tell me something
I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to
Tell me something
Girl, I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to
Tell me something
Girl, I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to
Tell me something, girl
