I'm fucked up again, I shouldn't drive tonight,
But I keep thinking of you
I hurt you again, I shouldn't lie tonight,
So the next few words are true

Never again, never again, no, will I leave you high and
Never again, never again, no
Never again, never again, no, will I leave you high and dry
This time, I more than mean it

I'm sorry, I'm not what you wanted, I'm sorry, sorry I let you down
I could use some poor excuse, 'cause the hardest thing to say,
Oh, it's the hardest thing to say in the world;
I'm sorry, yeah I'm sorry

Well I messed up again,
Thinking about the times I was lost and you let me in
And I'm only human,
But both you and I, we know the way that this will end

So I say never again, never again, no, will I leave you high and
Never again, never again, no
Never again, never again, no, will I leave you high and dry
This time, I more than mean it, yeah

I'm sorry, I'm not what you wanted, I'm sorry, I'm sorry I let you down
I could use some poor excuse, 'cause the hardest thing to say,
Oh, it's the hardest thing to say in the world;
I'm sorry

I'm sorry, yeah I'm sorry

I'm sorry, I'm not what you wanted, I'm sorry, I'm sorry I let you down
I could use some poor excuse, 'cause the hardest thing to say,
Oh, it's the hardest thing to say in the world,
Is I'm sorry, I'm sorry, yeah
