I was born without a name
A soldier boy
The streets they see
This kids on a mission
?
With the guillotine
?

My head is like a flame

Well, we all get strange
And we know it
But we're cool with it
And we all get a little bit older
In this day and age
But we deal with it

My
Shaken with a fire
Burning deep inside
Still the politicians
They never listen
Money was the sound
He didn't hear
Which the politicians, they only listen

My head is like a flame
And my eyes are red (?)

Well, we all get strange
And we know it
But we're cool with it
And we all get a little bit older
In this day and age
But we deal with it

My head was like a flame
It was burning up, burning up, it was burning up
My head was like a flame
It was burning up, burning up, it was burning up

I became a child of the universe
Your born into this galactic prison

My head was like a flame
My eyes
My eyes were red

Well, we all get strange
And we know it
But we're cool with it
And we all get a little bit older
In this day and age
But we deal with it

My head was like a flame
It was burning up, burning up, it was burning up
My head was like a flame
It was burning up, burning up, it was burning up

My head was like a flame
My head was like a flame
My head was like a flame
My head was like a flame
