Well every day I throw a little party
But if it would be more fitting, fitting
And every time I come a little higher
Should I leap or go on living, living?
Hear the voices venomous and thrilling
In their hair, they're always calling, calling
But I wanna, gotta go the way my butt beats
So I'm not falling for the folly, folly

No one here is taking notice
No outline will ever hold us
It's not a new wave, it's just you and me
Eyes are the only witness
Die to prove we ever lived this
Invent our own kind of obscurity

Let's destroy a room with this love
We can drain out all the power, power
Steal from the makers who had made us
Leave them nothing to devour, devour
Well I am raw material
Make me plastic, make me fuel
I can be, I can be
I can be all

No one here is taking notice
No outline will ever hold us
It's not a new wave, it's just you and me
Eyes are the only witness
Die to prove we ever lived this
Invent our own kind of obscurity

No one here is taking notice
No outline will ever hold us
It's not a new wave, it's just you and me
Eyes are the only witness
Die to prove we ever lived this
Invent our own kind of obscurity
