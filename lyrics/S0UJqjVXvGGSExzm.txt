cold shakes and hot sweats
i'd break down
love is not the color
take this down
push out the power
safe in sound
he's got the symptoms
mild confusion
eyes flash in hard light
head spins round
pale skin white ghost
pulls you down
floor sinks and you fall
to the ground
he's got the symptom
mild confusion
hold onto something
holds you down
you got that something
holds me down
I don't hear it
I don't see it
