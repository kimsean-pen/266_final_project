They look down from
Their ivory tower
At a world they never really knew
They light their torches
And draw their arrows
They're on the hunt, and
Tonight the prey is you

But I can show you what it's like

What it's like to be hated
What it's like to be degraded
What it's like to be a target
But have skin as thick as steel
I'll show you how to bring chaos
I'll show you how to be dangerous
In a world that teaches
An eye for an eye
I'll show you how to survive, oh

And now you've seen
From behind the veil
Kings, knights, and pawns
All bleed the same
I refuse to be one of the fallen
I refuse to be one of the slain

And I can show you what it's like

What it's like to be hated
What it's like to be degraded
What it's like to be a target
But have skin as thick as steel
I'll show you how to bring chaos
I'll show you how to be dangerous
In a world that teaches
An eye for an eye
I'll show you how to survive, oh

I'll show you how to survive
In a world that teaches
An eye for an eye
I'll show you how to survive
I'll show you how to survive, yeah
I refuse to be one of the fallen
I refuse to be one of the slain

But I can show you what it's like

What it's like to be hated
What it's like to be degraded
What it's like to be a target
But have skin as thick as steel
I'll show you how to bring chaos
I'll show you how to be dangerous
In a world that teaches
An eye for an eye
I'll show you how to survive
