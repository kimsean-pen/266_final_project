There's no sign on the gate
And there's mud on your face
Don't ya think it's time we reinvestigate the situation
Put some fruit on you plate

You've forgotten how it started
Close you eyes
Think of all the bubbles of love we made

And you're down on your knees
It's too late, oh don't come crawlin'
And you lay by my feet
What a big mistake, I see you fallin

Got a buzz in my head
And my flowers are dead
Can't figure out a way to rectify this situation
Don't believe what you said

You've forgotten how it started
Close you eyes
Think of all the bubbles of love we made

And you're down on your knees
It's too late, oh don't come crawlin'
And you lay by my feet
What a big mistake, I see you fallin

I could sting like a bee
Careful how you treat me
Baby I don't think I'll accept your sorry invitation
Close the door as you leave

You've forgotten how it started
Close you eyes
Think of all the bubbles of love we made

And you're down on your knees
It's too late, oh don't come crawlin'
And you lay by my feet
What a big mistake, I see you fallin

And you cry over me
I can't wait, I feel you stalling
And you try to reach me
What a big mistake, I hear you calling

And you're down on your knees
It's too late, oh don't come crawlin'
And you lay by my feet
What a big mistake, I see you fallin
