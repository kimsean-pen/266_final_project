I'm running out of faith
Be careful who you tell
I'm running out of faith
Be careful who you tell

whoaoo
whoaoo

She's blackening my name
My army never came
its water under the bridge
be careful who you tell

whoaoo

cause you gotta look her in the eye
and you gotta love your way of life
cause you got a guilty, filthy soul
don't ya know its out of your control

whoaoo

she's blackening my name
I know you feel the same
its water under the bridge
be careful who you tell

whoaoo
whoaoo

stop squeezing on my neck
your unemployment check
its water under the bridge
Be careful who you tell

whoaoo

cause you gotta look her in the eye
and you gotta love your way of life
cause you got a guilty, filthy soul
don't ya know its out of your control

Wooooh (Wooooh Wooooh Wooooh) X4
waiting on a blood line
you can find some free time
look at who you're hating

now your celebrating
waiting on a blood line
you can find some free time
waiting on a blood line X3
She's blackening my name
be careful who you tell
cause you gotta look her in the eye
and you gotta love your way of life
cause you got a guilty, filthy soul
don't ya know its out of your control
