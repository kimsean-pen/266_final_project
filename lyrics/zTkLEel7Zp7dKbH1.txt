I've been trying not to come around
Been strung out on the kitchen floor
You know that when you are feeling down
Someone else is always feeling more

I've been down a bit
I've been down a bit

I had my face pressed up against the wall
When the only thing that's left is sound
Yeah sounding like a total bore

Cos I'm dead
There's nothing going on in my head
There's nothing going on in my eyes

I've been stuck inside the lost and found
Being left out only makes me want it more
When you always try to cut me out
Well I rumble from the rotten core

I've been down a bit
I've been down a bit

I had my face pressed up against the wall
When the only thing that's left is sound
Yeah sounding like a total bore

Cos I'm dead
There's nothing going on in my head
There's nothing going on in my eyes

Cos I'm dead
There's nothing going on in my head
There's nothing going on in my eyes

You know I sold my brain out today
Yeah everybody's saying it'll be ok

Cos I'm dead
There's nothing going on in my head
There's nothing going on in my eyes

Cos I'm dead
There's nothing going on in my head
There's nothing going on in my eyes
