Can somebody save me?
'Cause I'm thinking maybe
That you can take me piece by piece, yeah
Then you got your reasons
But I didn't need 'em
And either way I'm on my knees, yeah

You knew when I was wrong
You say that I'm deranged
I can see that you're uneasy and it's not gonna change
And no matter how far
Wherever you

Wherever you go I'm callin'
Either way you're breaking my heart
Wherever you go I'm crawlin'
Even when we're fallin'
Even when we're fallin' apart

You say that you're leavin'
Say that you don't need him
And I'll I do is give and you just take
I guess that I knew it
I can't make it through it (no)
But I'm gonna try this anyway

(You knew) you knew when I was wrong
You knew that I'm deranged
I can see that you're uneasy and it's not gonna change
(No matter) and no matter how far
Wherever you

Wherever you go I'm callin'
Even when you're breaking my heart, yeah
Wherever you go I'm crawlin'
Even when we're fallin'
Even when we're fallin' apart
Yeah, looks like were fallin' apart

In your garden where the roses sleep
(I can make you anything you wanna be)
When that body's close to me
(I can give you anything you'd ever need)

But when I fall to the floor
'Cause I can't feel anymore
You can have my heart, girl
You don't have to steal anymore
When I look to the stars
Wherever you are

Yeah, wherever you are
Wherever you go I'm callin'
Even when you're breaking my heart, yeah
Wherever you go I'm crawlin'
Even when we're fallin'
Even when we're fallin' apart

Wherever you go I'm crawlin'
Wherever you go I'm crawlin' (ever)
Wherever you go I'm crawlin'
Even when we're fallin'
Even when we're fallin' apart
Yeah, I guess we're fallin' apart

Mmmm, looks like were fallin' apart

Yeah, I guess I'm fallin' apart
