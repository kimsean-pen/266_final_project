Everyone, is now leaving
[foreign language,
Indeschiperable to me
0: 30 You found your hideaway
Mixing up the things you hate
With things you're just afraid

Hold me
If you feel like coming clean to me
I won't misjudge
I told you
Open up is what you need

Love with the friends
You made up in your head
Everyone is loving you
So well
You just -
This - love - and - atmosphere
Protects you well indeed
Gravity so strong
You don't even know how to leave

Hold me
If you feel like coming clean to me
I won't misjudge
I told you
Coming back is what you need

There's no need to be afraid
Coming back is what you need
I told you
I'll be there for you to see me baby
I'll protect you duty and...

You need to hold me
