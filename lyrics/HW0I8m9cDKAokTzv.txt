Spiky lady shiny queen
Don't you tell them what you've seen
Plastic people silicon
Never let them in your home
Don't become a middle man
Keep your mouth shut if you can

Don't you tell them what you know
They will go anyway the wind blow
Be my best friend, be my baby
I'll be there for you maybe
Don't get on the roller coaster
Ya burn your fingers like a toaster

Just a fair weather friend
Gone when the summer end
They will look into your eyes
Tell you pretty perfume lies
Slinky slimy lotus eaters, jeepers creepers
Get a load of those peepers

Talking all that mumbo jumbo
People pass in solo limbo
See them slip, see them slide
But have you seen the nasty side
With all the smiling and kissing
Listen to the hiss, hiss hissing

She slip, she slides, she don't know why she hide
Dizzy little missy with a twinkle in her eye, bye, bye
Finger lickin' good, kill you if she could
Dig it when you're down send in the clown

Don't let them poke, don't let them peek
Their friendly chat is cheap
You look so fine you look so hip
You're styling makes me trip
Take your place if they could
These are the people in your neighborhood
She slips, she slides, she don't know why she hide

Poking, peeking, sneaking, cheating, sniffing, sliding
A running and hiding
Creeping, crawling, feeling and mauling
Fickle little tickle, brains like pickles

She slip, she slides, she don't know why she hide
Dizzy little missy with a twinkle in her eye, bye, bye
Finger lickin' good, kill you if she could
Dig it when you're down send in the clown

She slip, she slides, she don't know why she hide
Dizzy little missy with a twinkle in her eye, bye, bye
Finger lickin' good, kill you if she could
Dig it when you're down send in the clown

She slip, she slides, she don't know why she hide
Dizzy little missy with a twinkle in her eye, bye, bye
Finger lickin' good, kill you if she could
Dig it when you're down send in the clown

She slip, she slides, she don't know why she hide
Dizzy little missy with a twinkle in her eye, bye, bye
Finger lickin' good, kill you if she could
Dig it when you're down send in the clown
Send in the clown, send in the clown

She slip, she slides, she don't know why she hide
She slip, she slides, she don't know why she hide
She slip, she slides, she don't know why she hide
Dizzy little missy with a twinkle in her eye, bye, bye
Finger lickin' good, kill you if she could
Dig it when you're down send in the clown

She slip, she slides, she don't know why she hide
Dizzy little missy with a twinkle in her eye, bye, bye
Finger lickin' good, kill you if she could
Dig it when you're down send in the clown

She slip, she slides, she don't know why she hide
Dizzy little missy with a twinkle in her eye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
