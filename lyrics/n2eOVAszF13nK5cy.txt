If we don't neutralize decay,
We may run out of tomorrows.
Time tryeth truth,
And truth was found and fined.
Let's break bread together,
Our honesty moves more than lies.
What do you mean "I need"?
In suffering you breed.
If we don't neutralize decay,
We may run out of tomorrows.
Time tryeth truth,
And truth was found and fined.
I can hear the kiss fill me
Through the minds and warning signs.
Sounds of ghosts go further,
If you engage in a coven with crows.
If we don't neutralize decay,
We may run out of tomorrows.
Time tryeth truth,
And truth was found and fined.
If we don't neutralize decay,
We may run out of tomorrows.
Time tryeth truth,
And truth was found and fined.
So if we don't neutralize decay,
We may run out of tomorrows
Time tryeth truth,
And truth was found and fined.
So if we don't neutralize decay,
We may run out of tomorrows
Time tryeth truth,
And truth was found and fined.
I can hear the kiss fill me
Through the minds and warning signs.
Sounds of ghosts go further
If you engage in a coven with crows.
If we don't neutralize decay,
We may run out of tomorrows.
Time tryeth truth,
And truth was found and fined.
If we don't neutralize decay,
We may run out of tomorrows.
Time tryeth truth,
And truth was found and fined.
