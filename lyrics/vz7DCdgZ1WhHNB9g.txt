Maybe I'll treat you better
Maybe I'll be your friend
Maybe I'll wear your sweater
Maybe I'll find some time
To go shopping
And buy you nicer clothes
'Cause the ones you've got have got to go
I'll cook your dinner
Put some meat on those bones

That's the least I could do
I'd be so good for you

I build you up
I'll be the best
You'd have it all
If we were, if we were
You'd never be
So damn depressed
If we were, if we were
I build you up
You'd never rest
If we were, if we were
We'd be the most beautiful mess
If we were forever...

Maybe I'll do your laundry
Maybe I'll scratch your back
Tell you I adore you
Make you feel like a man
And all of that
Now wouldn't that be nice?
And you've got a life, wouldn't think less
I'll drive you crazy for the rest of your life

That's the least I could do
I'd be so good to you

I build you up
I'll be the best
You'd have it all
If we were, if we were
You'd never be
So d.amn depressed
If we were, if we were
I build you up
You'd never rest
If we were, if we were
We'd be the most beautiful mess
If we were forever...

You don't realize what your missing
All the huggin', all the kissin'
Shut up and listen to me

But we're not
I forgot

I build you up
I'll be the best
You'd have it all
If we were, if we were
You'd never be
So d.amn depressed
If we were, if we were
I build you up
You'd never rest
If we were, if we were
We'd be the most beautiful mess
If we were forever...

You don't realize what your missing
All the huggin', all the kissin'
Shut up and listen to me

But we're not
I forgot
