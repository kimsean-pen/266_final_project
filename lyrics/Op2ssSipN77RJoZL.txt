Early in the morning I put breakfast at your table
And make sure that your coffee has it's sugar and cream
Your eggs are over easy, your toast done lightly
All that's missing is your morning kiss that used to greet me
Now you say the juice is sour, it used to be so sweet
And I can't help but to wonder if you're talking 'bout me
We don't talk the way we used to talk, it's hurtin' so deep
I've got my pride, I will not cry
But it's makin' me weak

I'm not your superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down
And think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human
This girl needs more than occasional hugs
As a token of love from you to me, ooh, baby

I fought my way through the rush hour trying to make it home just for you
I want to make sure that your dinner will be waiting for you
But when you get there you just tell me you're not hungry at all
You said you'd rather read the paper and you don't want to talk
You like to think that I'm just crazy when I say that you've changed
I'm convinced I know the problem
You don't love me the same
You're just going through the motions and you're not being fair
I've got my pride, I will not cry
Still I can't help but care

I'm not your superwoman (oh, no, no, no)
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down (think that everything is okay)
And think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human (I'm only human)
This girl needs more than occasional hugs
As a token of love from you to me
I'm not your superwoman (hoo, hoo, hoo, ooh, ooh, hoo)
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down (hey, don't let me down)
And think that everything's okay (don't you let me down)
Boy, I am only human (I'm only human, yeah)
This girl needs more than occasional hugs
As a token (ooh, ooh) of love from you to me

Ooh baby, look into the corners of your mind
I'll always be there for you through good and bad times
But I can't be that superwoman that you want me to be
I'll give my everlasting love if you'll return love to me
I'm not your superwoman

I'm not your superwoman (oh no, oh no)
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down (think that everything's okay)
And think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human (I'm only human)
This girl needs more than occasional hugs
As a token of love from you to me

Oh ho, if you feel it in your heart and you understand me
Stop right where you are, everybody sing along with me
Hoo, hoo, hoo, ooh, ooh, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo
I'm the kind of girl that can treat you so sweet
But you got to realize that you got to be sweeter to me, oh ho, ho
Hoo, hoo, hoo, ooh, ooh, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo
I need love, I need just your love
I'm not your superwoman

I'm not your superwoman (oh no)
Kind of girl that you can let down (you can let down)
And think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human (I'm only human)
This girl needs more than occasional hugs (hey, hey, hey, hey)
As a token of love from you to me
I'm not your superwoman
