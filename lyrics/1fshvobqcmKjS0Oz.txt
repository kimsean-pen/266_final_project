So I've been thinkin' 'bout something
Lately, I've been alive
'Cause I found my reason in nothing
So I won't close my eyes
'Cause I don't want to miss one second
And I don't want to feel so cold
And I don't want to be so sad that we are, who we are
'Cause we had no control

But only by the night
Will we ever make headlines
Will we ever make things right
When we've only ourselves to blame
When we've only ourselves to blame

So I won't sleep, no more
No, I won't sleep, no more
(I won't sleep...)
I always thought that there'd be more than just wishing my life away
Like I could always
Figure it out and never have to abandon what's in front of me
(Dream no more)

So get this doubt out of my head
It's only real if you let it
And I've been letting go of my ghosts
I'll never let them catch me no more
But these words are all I have, so I'll just keep dreaming out loud
And if I just keep talking, maybe I'll figure all of this out

But only by the night
Will we ever make headlines
Will we ever make things right
When we've only ourselves to blame
And we've only ourselves to blame

So I won't sleep, no more
No, I won't sleep, no more
No, I won't sleep, no more
I always thought that there'd be more than just wishing my life away
Like I could always
Figure it out and never have to abandon what's in front of me
Dream no more
