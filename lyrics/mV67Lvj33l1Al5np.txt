Spread out clean sheets
Get the mind ready for the deep sleep
Fade out the cold lights
Still, these linens feel like concrete

Drifting through closed eyes
Watching incapacities materialise
Like in the song, a prisoner
Of my own device

Another part of me (Another part of me)
Could have been the unleashed
What would it be, how would it feel
If the ideals of self were real?
Is it a cure, or is it disease?
Would I know emptiness from peace?
Tracing the fears back to the start
Raptures to tear the world apart
Written in scars that never heal
This is the deal
This is the deal

Wake up like an undead
Ashes of the night swirling through my head
Breathless, heartless
Ravenous
Ravenous (Ravenous)

Another part of me (Another part of me)
Could have been the unleashed

Forever circling back to the crossroads of my dreams
Where twin black angels lead the way

What would it be, how would it feel
If the ideals of self were real?
Is it a cure, or is it disease?
Would I know emptiness from peace?
Tracing the fears back to the start
Raptures to tear the world apart
Written in scars that never heal
This is the deal

What would it be, how would it feel
If the ideals of self were real?
Is it a cure, or is it disease?
Would I know emptiness from peace?
Tracing the fears back to the start
Raptures to tear the world apart
Written in scars that never heal
This is the deal
This is the deal
This is the deal
