The creation I can't remember
Unsecure I roam in fear
The final steps I've taken
What waits beyond this void?
"I sucked out your lifeblood
Tore down your fortress
Burned down the woods
I poisoned your harvest"
Trust and hope
I have lost
I see death
In the eyes of dawn
Deceit
Forged in the darkened depths of the womb
Seeds of betrayal planted in rotten soil
The ground swells
It's the end
I see the face
Of the dead god
Legions of the dead
Invading our realm
Forever deaf to the distant warning
Blinded are my eyes
Tied are my hands
Sleeping wide awake
Got lost within myself
I followed all the paths
Rigtheous in my heart
Slept without the dreams
Got lost within myself
When will I remember?
When will I hear the call?
When shall my forces gather?
When shall my battle begin?
"I've insulted your life since birth
You have never seen my true face
You failed to realize I'm your kin
I infected your mind when you smiled"
Awake!
The grip of anxiety
Shall strangle the brave no more
The son of earth and wind
Shall guide us in our wake
"You might hear the horn resound
You might summon back your king
As long as you love, I will hate
As long as you breed, I will kill"
Blinded are my eyes
Tied are my hands
Sleeping wide awake
Got lost within myself
I followed all the paths
Rigtheous in my heart
Slept without the dreams
Got lost within myself
