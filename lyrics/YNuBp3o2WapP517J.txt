I thought I saw your face today
But I just turned my head away
Your face against the trees
But I just see the memories
As they come
As they come

And I couldn't help but fall in love again
No, I couldn't help but fall in love again

I saw it glitter as I grew
And loved it why I never knew
I thought this place was heaven sent
But now it's just a monument
In my mind
In my mind

And I couldn't help but fall in love again
No, I couldn't help but fall in love again

The cars and freeways implore me to stay away
Out of this place
My mother said just keep your head
And play it as it lays

The cars and freeways implore me to stay away
Out of this place
My mother said just keep your head
And play it as it lays

I somehow see what's beautiful
In things that are ephemeral
I'm my only friend, am I?
Love is just a piece of time
In the world
In the world
And I couldn't help but fall in love again
No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
