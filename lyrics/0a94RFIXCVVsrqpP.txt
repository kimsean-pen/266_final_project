The secret of the easy yoke
Pedro the lion

I could hear the church bells ringing
They peeled aloud your praise
The members? faces were smiling
With their hands outstretched to shake

Its true they did not move me
My heart was hard and tired
The perfect fire anoint me
I could not find you any where

Could someone please tell me the story of sinners ransomed from the fall
I still have never seen you
And some days I don? t love you at all

The devoted were wearing bracelets to remind them why they came
Some concrete motivation and the abstract could not do the same
But if all that? s left is duty
I? m falling on my sword
At least then I would not serve an unseen distant lord

Could someone please tell me the story of sinners ransomed from the fall
I still have never seen you
And some days I don? t love you at all

If this is only a test I hope that I? m passing
'cause I? m losing esteem
But I still want to trust you

Peace, Be still
Peace, Be still
Peace, Be still
Peace, Be still
