Lately I don't think of you at all
Or wonder what you're up to

Or how you're getting on
I never think of calling you
Or how things could have been
Or wonder where you sleep at night
Or whose arms you sleep in

I'm living alone, living alone
I don't need you any more
Living alone, alone
I don't need you any more

Lately I don't get lost in daydreams
I never lay awake at night
Staring in my bed
And I don't think about your face
Or anything you've said
And I don't think twice
When someone says your name
Or twist my mind in circles
Wondering which of us to blame

I'm living alone, living alone
I don't need you any more
Living alone, alone
I don't need you any more

I never walk alone and think of all the empty words
Or wonder when the day will break
Or when the tides will turn
And I don't break down
When someone says your name
Or twist my mind in circle
Wondering which of us to blame

I'm living alone, living alone
I don't need you any more
Living alone, alone
I don't need you any more

Lately I don't think of you at all
Lately, lately, oh lately
