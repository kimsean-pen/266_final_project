I can't remember the time or place
Or what you were wearing
It's unclear about how we met
All I know, it was the best conversation that I've ever had
'Til this day I've never found someone
With eyes as wide as yours
I've been searching up and down this coast
Overlooking what I need the most

Did you notice I was afraid?
I thought I'd run out of things to say
Two more hours until today burns this away
And it starts all over again

The sky will never look the same again
'Til you show me how it could be
The sky will never look the same again
'Til you show me how it could be

And everything else is irrelevant
To the story so far
A coincidence that you look like her from afar
Is it true that you like to sleep alone?
Or is it what you just tell everyone?

Did you notice I was afraid?
I thought I'd run out of things to say
Two more hours until today burns this away
And it starts all over again

The sky will never look the same again
'Til you show me how it could be
The sky will never look the same again
'Til you show me how it could be

Until you show me how it could be
Until you show me how it could be

And when the world turns over
I'll keep my ears to the wall
And when the world turns over
I'll keep my feet straight on the ground

Did you notice I was afraid?
I thought I'd run out of things to say
Two more hours until today burns this away
And it starts all over again

The sky will never look the same again
'Til you show me how it could be
The sky will never look the same again
'Til you show me how it could be

Until you show me how it could be
Until you show me how it could be
