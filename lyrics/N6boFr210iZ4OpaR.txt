It's the hardest part when you stop believing
And you want too much so you keep deceiving.
Is there enough to share or are we destined to fight
Between the darkness and the light?
I'll have everything I need if I leave it behind,
I'm gonna walk this path as if I'm blind.
So hold on to what's good cause there's not a lot of it,
We all have hearts but we've all got demons.

You wanted to fall and I tried to save you.
Oh you had it all when they took it away from you.
You wanted to fall, now there's nothing left to lose.

I thought it'd be easy but the dream it ended,
I've had enough of always pretending.
I tried to leave the train from the first class cabin,
But the desert was dry and the wind was howling.
We've had too much and we lost the thrill of it,
We've had so much but it was never enough.

You wanted to fall and I tried to save you.
Oh you had it all when they took it away from you.
You wanted to fall and they took it away from you.
You had it all, now there's nothing left to lose.

We will never grow old.
No, we will never grow old.

You wanted to fall and I tried to save you.
And you had it all when they took it away from you.
You wanted to fall and they took it away from you.
You had it all, now there's nothing left to lose.
You got nothing left to lose.

We will never grow old.
No, we will never grow old.
