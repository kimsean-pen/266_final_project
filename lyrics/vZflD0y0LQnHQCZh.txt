When all else fails, I'll just assume I'm overtired
But I'll go tooth and nail to find a way to stay inspired
She's got a beautiful mind but my heart strings are bending
How could I enter a maze with no ending?
There's more to me than where I came from, so

I'm running away from the days that made me unstable
And I'm taking a chance on the lesson I learned
It's that, whoa, you got the best of me
But no, you won't take what's left of me
So I'm running away, I'm running away from you and me
(From you and me)

The piece that's missing is buried underneath the ground, you see
If this is temporary, I don't wanna lie to myself anymore
Well baby, I'm breaking out of this upstate town
I'm steering away from the safe and sound
There's more to me than where I came from, so

I'm running away from the days that made me unstable
And I'm taking a chance on the lesson I learned
It's that, whoa, you got the best of me
But no, you won't take what's left of me
So I'm running away, I'm running away from you and me
(From you and me)

I always wanted to be somebody
That makes everybody feel like somebody
I'm sorry to say I don't love you more than myself
No need to cry for help

I'm running away from the days that made me unstable
And I'm taking a chance on the lesson I learned
It's that, whoa, you got the best of me
But no, you won't take what's left of me
So I'm running away, I'm running away from you and me
(From you and me)
