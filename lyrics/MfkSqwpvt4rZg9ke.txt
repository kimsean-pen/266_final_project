People have round shoulders
From fairing heavy loads
And the soldiers liberate them
Laying mines along their roads

Sorrow paid for valor
Is too much to recall
Of the countless corpses piled up
Along the wailing wall

Melting down all metals
Turning plows and shears to swords
Shun words of the Bible
We need implements of war

Chalklines and red puddles
Of those who have been slain
Destiny, that crooked schemer
Says the dead shall rise again!

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy!

Now we've rewritten history
The one thing we've found out
Sweet taste of vindication
It turns to ashes in your mouth

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy!

If you're fighting to live
It's okay to die
The answer to your question is...
"Welcome to tomorrow"

Where do we go from here?
God have mercy!

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy!

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy!

Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy...
