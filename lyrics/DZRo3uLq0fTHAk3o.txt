Now they can make things worse for me

Sometimes I'd rather die
They can tell me lots of things
But I don't see eye to eye
Well, I know they know the way I think

I know they always will
But someday I'm gonna change my mind
Sometimes I'd rather kill
Bloodstains, speed kills

Fast cars, cheap thrills
Rich girls, fine wine
I've lost my sense, I've lost control, I've lost my mind
Well, things seem so much different now

The died away
I haven't got a steady job
And I've still got no place to stay
It's a futuristic modern world

But things aren't what they seem
Someday you'd better wake up
From this stupid fantasy
No more bloodstains, speed kills

Fast cars, cheap thrills
Rich girls, fine wine
I've lost my sense, I've lost control, I've lost my mind
Come on
Bloodstains, speed kills
Fast cars, cheap thrills
Rich girls, fine wine
I've lost my sense, I've lost control, I've lost my mind
