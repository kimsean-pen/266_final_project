I really don't have anything to say
Just pass me by
Don't ask me the same questions
Just deny I'm there

Like the time around me
This room is filled with nothing
Fell awkward in a place with many
Leave this space to me

I channel the pain through this
The paper, the pen, your eyes
To stare into what's next
It frightens me
No control, no reward

Still and breathless
I don't care what's behind
To you I look for energy
To catch my breath again

I channel the pain through this
The paper, the pen, your eyes
To stare into what's next
It frightens me
No control, no reward
I'm in circles again

I'm in circles again

The world looks old to me
Tonight I drink myself sober
Soon this could be over
Tale a picture of the pale

New morning knocking
Feels just like always
Pen down my regrets
I reach to you again

I channel the pain through this
The paper, the pen, your eyes
To stare into what's next
It frightens me
No control, no reward
I'm in circles again

I channel the pain through this
The paper, the pen, your eyes
To stare into what's next
It frightens me
No control, no reward
I'm in circles again
I'm in circles again
I'm in circles again
