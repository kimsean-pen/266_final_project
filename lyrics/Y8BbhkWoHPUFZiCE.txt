let me tell you what i think about frog spit.
i'm for it.
in the sunny months it's the only thing i trust.
and the naked lady shoots me with the fish.
i wanna fall back.
i want to fall back.
the best part of all is there's nothing square about it.
let me tell you what i think about turtle spit.
it's on my lip, it's on my tongue, there's nothing wrong.
smile politely to please the lady with the fish.
i want to fall back.
