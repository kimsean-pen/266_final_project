When I'm crawling through the night, God and Satan by my side
And I'm haunted in the dark
Sacramentum of the wild, evil born as human child
Seed of wolf and man we are
You are like the dead alive and you seal the time you die
Hear the call behind the dark, you can hide and start the run
When the seventh night has come
And you realize the mark, are you taken all alone?
Holy Christ in flesh and bone, pray the werewolves left the ark
See it's not a sermon, they can't call me back
And when the moon is high, we call the pack, we attack
This is the night of the werewolves, run for your life
This is the night, never get out alive
This is the night of the werewolves, run for your life
This is the night, never get out alive
Like a rebel in the war we have seen the night before
And we call the morning star, are you frightened all the more?
You can't hide behind a door, dead and sanctified you are
See I'm not a sacred victim in despair
And when the fever calls, the pack is there so beware
This is the night of the werewolves, run for your life
This is the night, never get out alive
This is the night of the werewolves, run for your life
This is the night, never get out alive
This is the night of the werewolves, run for your life
This is the night, never get out alive
This is the night of the werewolves, run for your life
This is the night, never get out a, never get out a
Never get out alive
