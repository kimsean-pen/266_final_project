Since we were kids, Brad and I would sit down at our instruments and,
without speaking,
launch into playing loud rock and roll at high volume.
It was probably in part to drown out the confusing noise of youth and
being told what to do all the time,
and in part it was a way of communicating with each other in a
language that was probably more expressive and fun than our normal
middle school banter — it also prevented
a lot of fighting over the remote control.
All to say, when we went to St.
Zenon (
In Quebec, to demo songs for the new album) late one
night, we sat down together and started playing this one.
It came easily and cheerfully, and when Brad started singing "
It Came to Me", I laughed at this almost "snake chasing its tale
moment," a song lyric aware of itself — and so this one came like
that, when we sat down with no agenda and
tapped into one of our oldest sorts of dialogue.
