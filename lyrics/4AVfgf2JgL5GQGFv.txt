How can I say that you're worth it?
Tell me let your love right in, while you lie awake with him.
Perfectly plead for my patience.
Though you're caught up in the sheets, I know sinners never sleep.

Am I a fool for falling for this.
Put to the side like I don't exist.

Don't tell me to leave, while I'm still dreaming.
Quit falling for me, while he is fast asleep.
Don't call when it all comes crumbling.
I won't let you repeat, this cycle has to end.

So long, it's been fun, now we're done.

Miss you's and wanting you hear now.
What a sick and twisted way, to keep both of us at bay.
Truthfully ruthless and reckless.
We ignore the warning signs, buried in your twisted mind.

Am I a fool for falling for this.
Put to the side like I don't exist.

Don't tell me to leave, while I'm still dreaming.
Quit falling for me, while he is fast asleep.
Don't call when it all comes crumbling.
I won't let you repeat, this cycle has to end.

So long, it's been fun, now we're done.

Am I a fool for falling for this?
Put to the side, like I don't exist.

Don't tell me to leave, while I'm still dreaming.
Quit falling for me, while he is fast asleep.
Don't call when it all comes crumbling.
I won't let you repeat, this cycle has to end.

So long, it's fun, but we're done.
