Leaving the valley
In a U-Haul loaded down
All of our belongings
Except for what we left in storage back in town
Long desert highways
Where the wheel stops, no one knows
My sister breathing
This song playing on the radio

How do you stop a rolling stone?
How will you know you're finally home, finally home
How many canyons will you run
Before your face warms in the sun, in the sun
Before you're finally home, finally home

Wish it would rain now
Like Hilda always says
The devil beats his wife again
As the monsoon clouds start rolling in
We got our model home
But what the Lord gives, he can take away
Raindrops on windshield
As the wipers wave a long goodbye

How do you stop a rolling stone?
How will you know you're finally home, finally home
How many canyons will you run
Before your face warms in the sun, in the sun
Before you're finally home, finally done running

Oh Dunlap
Oh Peoria
Oh Cactus
Oh Thunderbird
Oh Greenway
Oh Bell Road
Oh Union Hills & 35th Avenue
Oh Union Hills & 35th Avenue

If I swung my tassel to the left side of my cap
After graduation, will there be no going back?
