Just as he hit
The ground
They lowered a tow that
Stuck in his neck to the gills
Fragments of sobriquets
Riddle me this
Three half-eaten corneas
Who hit the aureole
Stalk the ground
Stalk the ground

You should have seen
The curse that flew right by you
Page of concrete
Stain walks crutch and hobbled sway
Auto-de-fe
A capillary hint of red
Only this manupod
Crescent in shape has escaped

The house half the way
Fell empty with teeth that
Split both his lips
Mark these words
One day this chalk outline
Will circle this city
Was he robbed of the asphalt
That cushioned his face?
A room coloured charlatan
Hid in a safe
Stalk the ground
Stalk the ground

You should have seen
The curse that flew right by you
Page of concrete
Stain walks crutch and hobbled sway
Auto-de-fe
A capillary hint of red
Only this manupod
Crescent in shape has escaped

Pull the pins (Pull the pins)
Save your grace (Save your grace)
Mark these words (Mark these words)
On his grave (On his grave)
Pull the pins (Pull the pins)
Save your grace (Save your grace)
Mark these words (Mark these words)
On his grave (On his grave)
Pull the pins (Pull the pins)
Save your grace (Save your grace)
Mark these words (Mark these words)
On his grave (On his grave)

You should have seen
The curse that flew right by you
Page of concrete
Stain walks crutch and hobbled sway
Auto-de-fe
A capillary hint of red
Everyone knows the last toes are
Always the coldest to go
