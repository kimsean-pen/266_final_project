This time around I wasn't honest enough with how I really felt
I'll spend the winter blending into the streets and sidewalks that make up this town
At least it gave me someone else to write another one of these sad fucking songs about
You're just another sad song to me

I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet

You won't be here
I saw right through you on my basement floor
But could you even see past my chest?
Could you ever feel past these hands?
Your intentions were only skin deep

Mine weren't honest enough to fall past my teeth
I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never have you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet

You won't be here
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home
Will I ever know how it feels to be home again?
I've been told that home is where the heart is
If that's the case, I've never been home

I've got this lonely night and Jimmy Eat World
I never had you and you told me I never did
The truth is you won't even be there when I can't stand on my own two feet
You won't be here
