Woke up in the morning, travelling straight into the sun
Told my friends and family I was gone
Looked back in the mirror, thought about who I had become
And I don't think that anything's gone wrong

Jumped out of my suitcase and went travelling down the road
Went back to the place where I was born
Thinking about my future, thinking about how far we have come
Oh, I don't think I'm gonna be going home

And the day goes on, goes on, goes on, goes on
And the day goes on
And the day goes on, goes on, goes on, hold on
And the day goes on

Went down to Virginia thinking 'bout how to change my name
Just in case I have to fly away
Jumped onto a spaceship and I went to outer space
And now I think I'm gonna be okay

And the day goes on, goes on, goes on, goes on
And the day goes on
And the day goes on, goes on, hold on
Whenst the day goes (on)

And I'm long gone
And I'm long gone
And I'm right where I belong

I went to the future thinking about how to spend my day
Thinking about the things I can't explain
It's 1900 and the times are going to change
Oh, now I think we're gonna be okay

And the day goes on, goes on, goes on, goes on
And it goes along
And the day goes on, hold on, hold on, stay strong
And the day goes on
