Now I'm in love again
No this time its not with my hand
Wandering murdering
Every time that I get the chance

I'm a human but remember first I'm a man
You painted pictures for me
that I refuse to understand
Cause I want everything for no reason
Cause yesterday it felt so good
But today it feels so bad

These streets got me wandering
Looking for my fix again
I should have paid the chinese girl
Now I'm losing everything I have

Yesterday if felt so good
But now it feels so bad

Now I'm alone again
empty black and very cynical
I can't get enough
My condition is critical

Deep dark lover momma
sure got enough to eat
when I'm not alone cryin
murdering
wandering
I'll rip your heart out with my pretty smile
Help Me!

Girl I want everything you got for no reason
Yesterday it felt so good
But now it feels so bad

These streets got me wanderin'
Looking for my fix again
I should have paid the Chinese girl
Now I'm losing everything I have

Yesterday it felt so good
But now today it feels so bad

Losing
mama I'm losing
oh you know i'm losing my mind

I tell ya I want everything mama
for no reason at all
Cause yesterday it felt so good
But today it feels so bad

These streets got me wanderin'
Looking for my fix again
I should have paid the Chinese girl
Now I'm losing everything I have

Yesterday it felt so good
But now it feels so bad
