Pull back the curtains show me all you've hiding behind the magic of the lights
The blinding lights
Walk down cobblestone streets with me hand in hand
And get lost in the honesty of the light
The darkest night

Secrets
All I wanna do is know your secrets, t-t-t-tell me
Tell me your secrets you're the mystery I'll never regret
T-t-t-tell me, t-t-t-tell me more
T-t-t-tell me, t-t-t-tell me more
T-t-t-tell me

I will be patient no need to rush
I won't be the one who leaves you high and dry
I am by your side
Riddle me this girl I want to uncover
What's underneath let me see your true colors now, tell me now

I wanna hear your
Secrets
All I wanna do is know your secrets, t-t-t-tell me
Tell me your secrets you're the mystery I'll never regret
T-t-t-tell me, t-t-t-tell me more
T-t-t-tell me, t-t-t-tell me more

I would cross the seven seas to see what's buried underneath
I would walk through dessert sands just to talk with you, talk with you
I would cross the seven seas to see what's buried underneath
I would walk through dessert sands just to talk with you
And hear you tell me your

Secrets
All I wanna do is know your secrets, t-t-t-tell me
Your secrets you're the mystery I'll never regret, t-t-t-tell me
Tell me your secrets all I wanna do I know your secrets, t-t-t-tell me
Tell me your secrets you're the mystery I'll never regret (I'll never regret)
T-t-t-tell me, t-t-t-tell me more
Tell me more, tell me more
Tell me more, tell me more
T-t-t-tell me more
T-t-t-tell me, t-t-t-tell me
T-t-t-tell me more
T-t-t-tell me, t-t-t-tell me more
