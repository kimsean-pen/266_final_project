A old man gave me a tip he said
"Don't waste your time with politics" he said
"Just chase skirts instead
Life is too short, and you're almost dead" he said
"I met a woman once, I gave her my best shot
But never did I talk
If I had her back, I'd be as real as my age
I so don't blame them, I wouldn't do the same
But I can blame them, I'd sing her this"

And you want to be dressed in poetry
But imagery doesn't fit
And you want resizing
But darling dear get a grip

And I think what I just wrote is going over my head
I'm stealing lines from myself
And what I said was never said
It's just a lyrical lie
Made up in my mind

And you want to be dressed in poetry
But imagery doesn't fit
And you want resizing
But darling dear get a grip

You're moving but not aware
You're drowsy without a care
Except keeping your whites behind your lids
And your lids are your best canvas
I can only imagine what you're painting, what you're painting
And your body on my mattress is proof
And your makeup on my pillow is proof
But do you think I am telling you the truth

It's just a lyrical lie
Made up in my mind

And you want to be dressed in poetry
But imagery doesn't fit
And you want resizing
But darling dear get a grip

And you want to be dressed in poetry
But imagery doesn't fit
And you want resizing
But darling dear get a grip
