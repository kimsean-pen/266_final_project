Don't believe in suicide
Rock'n'roll's contagious
smile ain't fooling
They rolled their tanks straight
through your head
Circumcised in debutante confusion

Restless youth are in decline
Start your wars but don't march blind

All those years of powdered mirrors
Watch the beat - how does it feel?
Arcade rules'n'battle plans
Rattled in confusion

Let those believe in flowered dreams
Bust your scene back on its knees
I wanna be a defector
'Cause I want no part of their plan
Yeah, I wanna be a defector
