I was waiting for a cross-town train in the London Underground
When it struck me (when it struck me)
That I'd been waiting since birth to
find a love that would look and sound
Like a movie
So I changed my plans, I rented a camera and a van
And then I called you
I need you to pretend that we are in love again
And you agreed to

I want so badly to believe
That there is truth, that love is real
And I want life in every word
To the extent that it's absurd

I grease the lens and frame the shot using a friend
As my stand-in (as my stand-in)
The script had called for rain but it was clear that day
So we faked it
The marker snapped and I yelled, "Quiet on the set!"
And then called, "Action!" (And the called action)
I kissed you in a style Clark Gable would have admired
I thought it classic

I want so badly to believe
That there is truth, that love is real
And I want life in every word
To the extent that it's absurd
I know you're wise beyond your years
But do you ever get the fear
That your perfect verse is just a lie
You tell yourself to help you get by

That you tell yourself to help you get by
That you tell yourself to help you get by
