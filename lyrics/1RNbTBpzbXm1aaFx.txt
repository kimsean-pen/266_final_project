Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

I know where the body is
I know why the branches twist
And when the well is getting low
How it came to be so

I'm going back, yeah
I'm going back
I'm going back to bed, baby
It's just too too too too bad

I know how the story ends
I know who dies, I know who lives
I know both passing ships
And how it feels to really miss, so

I'm going back, yeah
I'm going back
I'm going back to bed baby
It's just too too too too too bad

I know the girl next door
Yeah, I know the dress she wore
She took the bait, huh, she took the call
Oh I know I've heard it all, so

I'm going back, yeah
I'm going back
I'm going back to bed, baby
It's too too too too too bad

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

I'm going back, yeah
I'm going back
I'm going back to bed, baby
It's too too too too too bad
