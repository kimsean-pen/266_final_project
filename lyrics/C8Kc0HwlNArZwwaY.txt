At first light

Deep within entrenchments
The orders are revealed
A final push impending
Encoded messages have been received

At first light
Fires of the enemy dead will burn bright
If in mourning they choose we die
Zero hour at first light

The waiting time is over
No final night before
Once more into action
Embrace the storm - oncoming for all

Standing
At the edge
Allegiances
Now pledged forever

Orders - unquestionable
All rank and file expendable

The frozen dawn emerges
Let the battle now commence
None surrendered through last night
Zero hour approaching

At first light
Fires of the enemy dead will burn bright
If in mourning they choose we die
Zero hour approaching
