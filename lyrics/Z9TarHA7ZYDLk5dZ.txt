I'm buried in the snow
As your blackened heart finally got frozen
No daylight in the horizon
Your warm and loving flames of wrath
Shall be my guiding light
In the silent hours

Light has faded
As has the touch of your palms
No more songs of joy
Only dreadful silence
And painful memories
Hold me day after day

[Chorus:]
Was it my shadow
That eclipsed the sun in your heart?
Was the ice cold river
Your final relief?
Light, joy, love, hope, trust
All is lost

"These hours of despair
Pitch-black holes in my soul
All is lost
I can't forgive myself
I will follow you"

[Chorus]

"These hours of despair
Pitch-black holes in my soul
All is lost
I can't forgive myself
I will follow you"

[Chorus]
