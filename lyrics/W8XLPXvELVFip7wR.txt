I watch you breathing
I can't believe you sleep so calm
With all the dirty things that you've done to me
My eyes are a curse you see
'Cause they see an angel and not the demon child you've been
Fucking with my head once again it seems
Still I'm willing to believe

The crying out at night
It's not about what's wrong
The secret just slipped outside to hide
As this life moves on
I can't hold on
And I feel like I can never get over it

And your eyes they flicker
You must be dreaming evil dreams
Are you eating someone's heart?
Is it what it seems?
You smile when you make them scream
But I know your sadness
There has to be a better way
Someone get me some kind of priest to break
Some kind of words to say

The crying out at night
It's not about what's wrong
The secret just slipped outside to hide
As this life moves on
I can't hold on
And I feel like I can never get over it

You kick me in the face
I will take it
You make a promise
You always break it
I've lived in this shell of shame
For so long
So what am I doing?
Why do I choose to stay?
Seem things just don't get better somehow

The crying out at night
It's not about what's wrong
The secret just slipped outside to hide
As his life moves on
I can't hold on
And I feel like I can never get over it

And I feel like I can never get over it
And I feel like I can never get over it
