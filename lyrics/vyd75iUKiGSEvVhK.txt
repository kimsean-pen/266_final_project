Falling in love was the last thing I had on my mind
Holding you is the warmth that I thought I could never find

(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Sitting here you're all alone)
Just trying to decide
(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Whether to go on alone)
Or stay by your side
(Ooh ooh ooh)

(Then I stop myself because)
I know I could cry
I just can't find the answers
To the questions that keep going through my mind

Hey babe
Isn't it time

(Isn't it time you took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)
Isn't it time

(Isn't it time you took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)

I've seen visions of someone like you in my life
A love that's strong reaching out
Holding me through the darkest night

(Ooh ooh ooh)

(Sitting here you're all alone)
Just trying to decide
(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Whether to go on alone)
Or stay by your side
(Ooh ooh ooh)

(Then I stop myself because)
I don't want to cry
I just can't find the answers
To the questions that keep going through my mind

Hey babe
Isn't it time
(Isn't it time you took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)
Isn't it time
(Maybe it's time you took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)

I feel a warmth in my heart
And my soul that I never knew
This love affair gives me strength
That I need just to get me through

(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Sitting here you're all alone)
Just wondering why
(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Then I stop myself because)
I know I could cry
(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Then I think of you)
And everything seems alright
I've finally found the answers
To the questions that keep going through my mind

Hey babe
Isn't it time
(Maybe this time you don't have to wait)
I know it's time
(Don't have to wait)
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
Ooh yeah I know it's time
(Isn't it time)
(Maybe this time you don't have to wait)
It must be time
(Don't have to wait)
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
Yeah it must be time
(Isn't it time)
(Maybe this time you don't have to wait)
Made up my mind
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
It must be time
(Isn't it time)
(Losing this time you don't have to wait)
(Don't have to wait)
It must be time
(Isn't it time)
(Losing this love could be your mistake)
Yeah
(Isn't it time)
(Losing this time you don't have to wait)
(Don't have to wait)
(Losing this love would be your mistake)
(Isn't it time)
(Losing this time you don't have to wait)
(Don't have to wait)
(Losing this love would be your mistake)
(Isn't it time)
(Losing this time you don't have to wait)
(Don't have to wait)
(Losing this love would be your mistake)
(Isn't it time)
(Losing this time you don't have to wait)
(Don't have to wait)
(Losing this love would be your mistake)
(Isn't it time)
(Losing this time you don't have to wait)
(Don't have to wait)
(Losing this time you don't have to wait)
