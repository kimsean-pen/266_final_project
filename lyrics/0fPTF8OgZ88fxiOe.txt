You're a well paid scientist
You only talk in facts
You know you're always right
'Cause you know how to prove it, step by step

A PhD to show you're smart
With textbook formulas
But you're used up
Just like a factory hand

Something is wrong here
You won't find in on a shelf
You're well-paid, you're well-trained
You're tied to a rack

Company cocktails, gotta go
Say the right thing don't fidget, jockey for position
Be polite in the pyramid you hate
Sip that scotch, get that raise, this ain't no party at all

Something is wrong here
You won't find in on a shelf
You're well-paid, you're well-trained
You're tied to a rack

Cringe and tense up, grind your teeth
And wipe your sweaty palms
Close your windows driving past the lowlife company bar
They're making fun of you

Ha!

Ah, even you
You've gotta punch the clock, why don't you punch your boss?
Ah, even you
You just punch the clock, too scared to punch your boss

When will you crack?
When will you crack?
When will you...
Open your eyes, open your eyes, open your eyes?

Pull up to your sterile home, you're drained
Bite the heads off of your kids
Chew them well, they taste like you, just slam the door

Assigned here 'cause your company owns the land
All your colleagues live here too
Private guards in golf carts keep you safe at home?

Something is wrong here
You won't find in on a shelf
You're well-paid, you're well-trained
You're tied to a rack

When will you crack?
When will you crack?
When will you crack?
When will you crack?

The dark shattered underbelly of the American dream
Avoid it like the plague
It stares you from your bathroom mirror
Drown!
