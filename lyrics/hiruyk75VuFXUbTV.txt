Heavy thoughts seem to slip away
When you were here on my darkest days
I trust in you
Many debts I cannot repay
Too many clouds in my sky today
I trust in you

As if it really matters
You run

When I reach out for a hand to
Pull me through the storm
Pull me through the norm
I reach for you

Broken glass as the evening fades
Take another drink as the evening fades
I trust in you
Stealing rays from the sun so bright
Join a million people in the church tonight
I trust in you

As if it really matters
You run

When I reach out for a hand to
Pull me through the storm
Pull me through the norm
I reach for you

In my mind
I reach for you

Spread inside
My mind
You'll find
That you really matter
What's right
In this life
We must try
As if it really matters

I reach out for a hand to
Pull me through the storm
Pull me through the norm

I reach out for a hand to
Pull me through the storm
Pull me through the norm

When I reach, I reach, I reach
When I reach, I reach, I reach
I reach for you
