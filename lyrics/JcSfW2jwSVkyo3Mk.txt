Do I ever wonder?
More than words can say
Heaven knows it's
Hard enough to pray

Let me tell you something
There's a change in me
Even now you're gone
You'll always be

My only love, my only love
Only love, my only love

Does it seem so funny
For a fool to cry?
Do you know the
Meaning of goodbye?

There's a river flowing
By a willow tree
When you need to know
You remember me

My only love, my only love
Only love, my only love

Let me tell you something
More than words can say
But they're all I have
No other way

There's a river flowing
By a willow tree
When you find you're
There remember me
My only love, my only love
Only love, my only love
My only love, only love
My only love, only love
My only love, only love
My only love, only love
