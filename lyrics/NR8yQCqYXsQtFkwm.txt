Piece by piece
Limb by limb
Hear the screams of a dying world
Everything you bring smells of decay

Because you
You let me down
Deep down in a state of confusion
Hate
You build on you hate
As you lay under the guillotine

Stone by stone
Strength by strength
Your betrayal is monumental
Hiding through the cracks of fear
I see you dying

Because you
You let me down
Deep down in a different dimension
Greed
It's all about your greed
As you die under the guillotine

Heads will roll
Justice served

Because you
You let me down
Deep down in a state of confusion
Hate
You build on you hate
As you lay under the guillotine
Because you
You let me down
Deep down in a different dimension
Greed
It's all about your greed
As you die under the guillotine
