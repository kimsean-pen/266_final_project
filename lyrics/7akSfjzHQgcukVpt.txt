I got a feeling that we got a chemistry
Gimme what's on your mind
Telling me everything, but it ain't happening
Wish I could reach your vibe
Making movements
And I don't think you're looking for a new friend
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ready, been waiting here, can we get out of here?
Wanna get you alone
So if you're into me, I got the energy
Why are you on your phone?
'Cause the truth is
I'm not really looking for a new friend
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't see nothing wrong
With you and me getting along
I don't see nothing wrong
With you and me getting along, so

Sway with me
Don't speak
Stay with me
No sleep
Baby, are you tied up?
I don't wanna know now
Are we gonna stay up?
Are we gonna get out this crowd?
Sway with me

Both of us, kinda shy, but we ain't got the time
Wanna get out these clothes
Honestly I don't care, we can go anywhere
Wanna see how this goes
But the truth is
All this acting cool is kinda useless
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Morning is comin' in, tell me you're feelin' it
Don't look around
Got other plans I can make
If you're gon' waste it, gotta let me know
Don't you waste it
Don't be actin' stupid 'cause you're wasted
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sway with me
Don't speak
Stay with me
No sleep
Baby, are you tied up?
I don't wanna know now
Are we gonna stay up?
Are we gonna get out this crowd?
