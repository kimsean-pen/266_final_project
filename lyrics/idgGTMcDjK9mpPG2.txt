Well, I'll see you later
But I don't know when
Don't know if I'm coming
I'm coming 'round again

But I don't care
For that, they might stare
I know I mustn't step down

I ain't no beauty
But I'm a secret fox
I'm gonna put your presents
Inside my favourite box

And then so long
The universal song
I know I mustn't step down
