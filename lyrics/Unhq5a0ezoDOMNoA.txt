A kiss of shame tempt to question love.
Her sweet taste kills all beauty.
Eyes of a goddess I fall prison to.
A heart of a fool oh I've been cursed.
A Goddess of love she imprisons me.
So take my, take my hand.
I wont forget.
Her skin is crawling with the feeling of regret,
Is this, all she ever wanted?
Her dress flows shimmering,
Reflections of the damned cast upon these walls.
They scream for salvation.
Breaking everything you seem to love.
She, Rises up, From her shallows.
Breaking everything you seem to love.
I will never forget,
I wont forget.
I wont forget.
