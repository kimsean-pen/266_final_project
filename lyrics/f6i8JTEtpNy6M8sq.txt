When I turn to my favourite hideway
My hand on hip
Always be the same
Only half a plan

Once I thought that I was over you
Now you're back and I'm falling like a fool
You know the one I am

I'm ridiculed by my fantasy
Scheduling insanity
My eagerness comes untangled
I can't handle you

At least it will be a thrill
Keeping up with you

I'm going round and round this bunch of keys
So let me in because I'm about to freeze with my jealousy
Trying hard to persuade myself
That you aren't everything I need
But my tricks are weak

Oh darling, hold me like before
