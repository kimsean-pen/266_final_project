I can feel you in my room.
Why was I assigned to you?
I feel like I'm home on my own.
And it feels like you see me.

I know that you've been around.
Still I want, I want you to show your face.
You know that I've been around, still I want.
I know that you will be still.
I don't know which me to be.

I know that you know me better than I know me.
Still.

I can feel you in my room.
I don't know which me to be.
On my own.

I know that you've been around.
Still around.
You know that I've been around.
Still around.
I don't know which me to be.

I know that you know me better than I know me.

I can feel you in my room.
Why was I assigned to you?
I know that you know me better than I know me.
Still around.

Still.
I know that you know me better than I know me.
