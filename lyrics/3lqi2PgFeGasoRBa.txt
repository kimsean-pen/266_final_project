You're not home, this is your phone, though, right?
Explanations are thin
But I feel it's time
You want to know where I've been for
Such a long time
Disappearing act
Right before your eyes

It seems to me the only thing
That comes from fame is mediocrity
How could you steal the thing I love
Then keep it from me, just out of touch?

Hey Darling
The situation was justified
There were some things I saw before
I realized
That I was meant to be
Infinitely by your side
Distractions always hit but
We're good this time

Sometimes the heat of the crowd
Feels a little too close
Sometimes the shout of the room
Makes me feel so alone
