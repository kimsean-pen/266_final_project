Lay it all to rest, my saddest day
Hung cupid and warned right away
He came, called few so good
Trace my soldier, flash over

They cried, they laugh
My soldier's dead
'Cause they pulled a boy instead

They cried, they laugh
My soldier's dead
'Cause they pulled a boy instead

Poorest, poorest ear
A love for so many years
Slightest chance of falling grace
But so long till you'll be found
Poorest, poorest ear
