A DEAD GLARE
This very hard landscape.
Everybody's sitting around in cold,

She hears me bliking.
Leave the machine alone,
they're working overtime.

A brutal test patern,
A brutal test patern.
she sleeps.

If it comes, don't call 911.
The power lines is falling.
the power lines are falling down.
No guests, please.
HE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
No people, please.
Don't wanna go outside.
No Guests
NO GUESTS PLEASE

I Wanna Wash My Brain
I WANNA WASH MY BRAIN

A DEAD GLARE
This very hard landscape.
Everybody's sitting around in cold,

She hears me bliking.
Leave the machine alone,
they're working overtime.

You only know me when my head is full of talk,
but then minutes after I leave you, my head is surely gone. [repeat 4X]

I've got a feeling you don't wanna know a Carbon 14 brain test. [2X]

She dyed my pants.

I tried to tell her.
I think she understood
I think she understood.

I FEEL LIKE BLOOD COMBING MY BRAIN
I FEEL LIKE BLOOD COMBING MY BRAIN
I FEEL LIKE BLOOD COMBING MY BRAIN
I FEEL LIKE BLOOD COMBING MY BRAIN
