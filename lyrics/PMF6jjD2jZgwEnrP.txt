Tell me baby
What I gotta do
I've been waiting for a lifetime
To find a girl like you
You're so cool
Baby, I'm no fool
Takes one to know one
And I found you

I'm just a desperado
Down by Mexico
I've been everywhere you wanna go
I'm just a desperado
Always been alone
You're the only one who brings me home

(Instrumental Break)

I'm just a desperado
Down by Mexico
I've been everywhere you wanna go
I'm just a desperado
Always been alone
You're the only one who brings me home
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one who brings me home

Tell me baby
What I gotta do
