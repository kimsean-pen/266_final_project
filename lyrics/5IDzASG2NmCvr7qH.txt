Somewhere through this we have lost ourselves
Entranced by the forms which the night creates
And when the light will shine again
Ever such strength we will regain

So silence your mouth no more
Reaching out my heaven's soul
It seems so easy don't you think
Split it up for you and me

Dance with me by heaven's door
All alone and with no fear
Spiral forms I have never seen
So dance with me and cry no more

We are in heaven as brothers
Dancing in shadows will be no more
We are in December
We reach out hands for each other
Trying to save our soul
We are in December
