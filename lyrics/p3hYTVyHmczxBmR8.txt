Born to fight, and we're born to flee
Doomed to live on ecstasy
Born to lie, and we're born to cheat
Look in the mirror, who do you see?
Born to flee, and we're born to fight
Without your mask, you're terrified
Don't hide your personality
That's who you are, your identity

If the virtues of tomorrow
Cause the greed of today
We won't have a future
Nor liberty

Born to breathe, and we're born to pursue
That's all we are supposed to do
The semblance of our liberty
Is nothing more than slavery
Born to flee, and we're born to fight
Is it failure that's our delight?
Born to cheat, and we're born to lie
Look at yourself, have you lost your mind?

If the virtues of tomorrow
Cause the greed of today
We won't have a future
And no more liberty
If the virtues of tomorrow
Set the need on the way
We won't have a future nor liberty

Private vice leads to public virtue

Raised to think that we are free
Living in our caves
(Being slaves)
We lost control of our lives
At the mercy of the waves
(Massive waves)
Blind to see what's going on
Conditioned as we are
(And we are)
We lost control of our greed
But now we face it all
(Face our fall)

Keeping all that we've created
And consuming all that's possible
Reaching deep into temptation
Nothing can stop us
Guarantee our hard-earned profits
Multiplied ten-fold if possible
Reaching out for new redemption
Nothing avails our needs

My opponent won't rule out raising taxes
But I will
And the congress will push me to raise taxes and I'll say no
And they'll push, and I'll say no
And they'll push again, and I'll say to them
Read my lips

If the virtues of tomorrow
Cause the greed of today
We won't have a future
And no more liberty
If the virtues of tomorrow
Set the need on the way
We never had a future anyway
We had no future 'till today

Time and tide
Will not wait for anyone
