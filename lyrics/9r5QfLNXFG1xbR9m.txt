I'm lost, I'm lost
I kissed back then
I just ran out of this
It felt like snow

Looks like I'm sometimes
Just a flying beauty
Waiting on lock down
You take me upside down
Just a flying beauty
Waiting on lock down
I'll make it up and I'm
Just a flying beauty
Waiting on lock down
You take me upside down
Just a flying beauty
Waiting on lock down.

Too high to drag me
Cause I'm too late
We canceling all
We are now blind

You take me upside down
Just a flying beauty
Waiting on lock down
You take me upside down
Just a flying beauty
Waiting on lock down
I'll make it up and I'm
Just a flying beauty
Waiting on lock down
You take me upside down
Just a flying beauty
Waiting on lock down
