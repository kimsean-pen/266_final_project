You know you're making me mad
The way you look at me so
Kind of making me scared
Throwin' me those eyes of scarlet

And when I pass by
You've got nothing to say
Not even a-
Ooh, and it breaks my heart
You're like in a picture glass
We captured some moments (moments moments...)
And now I don't recognize you

Did you lose your playful mood?
This bad attitude
It's too bad, it's too bad, it's too bad

See how you're making me blue?
You know you're better than that
Staring at me, playing the fool
You must have lost your mind

Say, when you pass me by
You ain't got nothing to say
How could you forget to smile?
And it breaks my heart
I'm gonna climb up these clouds
And see things clear
You're gonna make me put my fist through this mirror
I'm so sick and tired of looking in this mirror

See how you're making me blue?
