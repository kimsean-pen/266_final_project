Flat as window panes
I see paint
Rolling around in the same old cage
Everything stays the same
Redder than roses
Easy to paint

Hope it don't come back
Hope it don't come back, again
Hope it don't come back
Hope it don't come back, again

Skin as thin as rows
Turn to dust
Do what you want to
Do what you must
Everything stays the same
Redder than roses
Easy to paint

Hope it don't come back
Hope it don't come back, again
Hope it don't come back
Hope it don't come back, again
Hope it don't come back
Hope it don't come back, again

Hope it don't come back
Hope it don't come back, again
Hope it don't come back
Hope it don't come back, again

Flat as window panes
I see pains
Rolling around the same old cage
Everything stays the same
Redder than roses
Easy to paint

Hope it don't come back
Hope it don't come back, again
Hope it don't come back
Hope it don't come back, again

Hope it don't come back, again
Hope it don't come back, again
Hope it don't come back, again
Hope it don't come back
