Tell me why この胸の pain
I think about you the hurt just gains
時重ねるほど切ない feeling
今日を永遠に never want no ending
その eyes その lips
全て虜に take my breath
会うたびに君は素敵に
Right behind you すぐ隣に

And I wanna know
誰よりも君を知りたい 君の全てを
And I wanna know
想いは届いてるのかな？
Give you my all

I need you in my arms
抑えて欲しい
この気持が溢れる前に
I need you in my life
鼓動響くように 君が必要さ
You are touching my heart
I won't let you go

I won't I won't
I won't I won't (no no)
I won't let you go
I won't I won't
I-I-I-I (I won't) I won't
I won't let you go (Baby)
I-I-I-I I-I-I-I I
I won't let you go
I won't I won't
I won't I won't
I won't let you go

I love it whenever you call me
瞬き頭上に tell me
When I look into your eyes
既に全てを奪われ baby, you're my only
君に会いたい 触れたい
伝えたい 見つめたい
And I feel something also too
I wanna hear you say you love me

And I wanna know
君は僕のどこまでを 理解してるの？
And I wanna go
僕だけの気持ちだとしても 離さない

I need you in my arms
抑えて欲しい
この気持が溢れる前に
I need you in my life
鼓動響くように 君が必要さ
You are touching my heart
I won't let you go

君だけ見るらしい 本当は僕は僕じゃない
You're my everything
You're my everyday
息する度君再確認
高鳴ってく想い 超えてく気持ち
Am I your something?
Am I okay?
少しでもいい do you think of me?

I need you in my arms
抑えて欲しい
この気持が溢れる前に
I need you in my life
鼓動響くように 君が必要さ
You are touching my heart
I won't let you go

I won't I won't
I won't I won't (no no)
I won't let you go
I won't I won't
I-I-I-I (I won't) I won't
I won't let you go (Baby)
I-I-I-I I-I-I-I I
I won't let you go
I won't I won't
I won't I won't
I won't let you go
