Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
What I'm gonna do without you, let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
Let the dream come true, let the dream come true

Rap 1:
Kick it, tip it, flip it, sip it, shake your budy 'round, get wicked
Use the door get on the floor, I still got more for you to store
Get on your feet, it's treated unique just feel the heat and get back to the beat
Rube dup, rube dup, rube dup, rube dup jump and shake your body, wine it up
Everybody shake your body DJ Bobo starts the party
Up and down, here we go don't look back, just let it flow
Up and down, don't loose your crown what goes up must come once down
Now hold tight, everythings's alright, there's no need to fight tonight

Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
What I'm gonna do without you, let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
Let the dream come true

Rap 2:
It's a break, I don't mean a fake, open your ears, it's not a mistake
The music is strong and I made these rhymes, partytime 'cause the time is mine
So let's go down, down on the floor, I wanna give you what you are waitin' for
You know what you want and you want it now
You know what you want when you hear the sound
Swing your body and have some fun, now you're on the run
This track has just begun it's done for fun and hits you like a gun
Jump up and down, toss and turn right to the ground before you burn
Pump the bass right in your face, just in case we start the race

Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
What I'm gonna do without you, let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true

Rap 3:
First I waited, then created, didn't debate it, just made it
The feeling is strong, so keep coming on
With the bass and the drums there's nothing wrong
Now get on up, take your shoes, swing your body, get wild and loose
One, two, three, four, tippin' and tappin', slippin' and slappin', there's no stoppin'

Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
What I'm gonna do without you, let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
Let the dream come true, let the dream come true.
