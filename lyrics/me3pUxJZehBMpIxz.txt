Orthodox Caveman

Face down where the ancient soil meets the discarded flesh,
the great stench of all that is rotten, and forgotten, the
unburied clamber into what you were, feasting on the joy
that is stolen forever, alchemy of disgust and hatred, the
unceremonious, the smell of all final moments at once,
embedded in the great beasts flesh, the carrier of the
tormented, the final journey through the impossible, a
silence so vast, that deafens with its roaring certainty,
to the unnamed places, guarded by the ancient carrion and
their minions of vomit and pestilence
