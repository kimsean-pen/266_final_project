This is the hand that will blind your eyes
And split your spine
This is the blade that'll visit your flesh
And release the wine

Play!
You play with toys that have triggers
And you hear how the led moves near
Play!
You play with razors and it hurts, it hurts
As you face your fears

So face the dark
And I'll teach you about fire
In the blink of an eye

- Now drink the Cyanide -

The worlds collide
And you know
That it's pure filth
That I hide

On these plains there's a burning ruin
That must be found
On these plains there's a demon that sleeps.
It must be unbound

Run!
You run for the borders
Where epistles burn in the arms of man
Run!
You run among bodies and they scream,
They scream to bite God's hand

So face the dark
And I'll teach you about fire
In the blink of an eye

(Now drink the Cyanide)

The worlds collide
And you know
That It's pure filth
That I hide

So face the dark
And I'll teach you about fire
In the blink of an eye

(Now drink the Cyanide)

The worlds collide
And you know
That It's pure filth
That I hide

(Now drink the cyanide)
(So face the dark)
(And I'll teach you about fire)
(And the blink of an eye)

When the dark does what the dark does best,
It's darkness!
Let the dark do what the dark does best,
Let there be darkness!

So face the dark
And I'll teach you about fire
In the blink of an eye

(Now drink the Cyanide)

The worlds collide
And you know
That It's pure filth
That I hide
