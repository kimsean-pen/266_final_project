To a Mongol, horses represent not only wealth and status,
They provide food and transportation.
To clearly see the Mongol's almost mythic relationship
With the horse just watch a horse race
The jockeys are children
The race course can be as long as 30 kilometers.
Magic powers are attributed to the winning horse
And spectators scramble to touch it
Hoping some will rub off.
