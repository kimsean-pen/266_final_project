how did it feel
when it came alive and took you
out of the black

it broke it's skin and sthrough
every part of me
every part of you

you made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running
so don't breathe when I talk cause you haven't been spoken to
i've got a gun for a mouth and a bullet with your name on it
pulled a trigger for a heart beating blood from and empty pocket

and I never knew why
and you didnt care when
you closed every door
and washed away no sin
and I promised you
like you promised me
that those vows we made
we messed them up
for free

you made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running
so don't breathe when I talk cause you haven't been spoken to
i've got a gun for a mouth and a bullet with your name on it
pulled a trigger for a heart beating blood from and empty pocket
an empty pocket

and it touches slow
never lets you go
deals a crooked hand

and it touches slow
never lets you go
deals a crooked hand

you made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running
so don't breathe when I talk cause you haven't been spoken to
i've got a gun for a mouth and a bullet with your name on it
pulled a trigger for a heart beating blood from and empty pocket
an empty pocket
