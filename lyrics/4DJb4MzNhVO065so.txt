Can we run away tonight
And hide from tomorrows

The glass is cracking tonight
Shattering our fears away
The silence in here fades
And its only your eyes that I see

Take me, pull me all around
Break me, Im yours

Can we run away tonight
And hide from tomorrows

We die in this moment
And I dont want to wake from this
I can barely breathe
Suffocating on what you gave me

Take me, pull me all around
Break me, Im yours

Can we run away tonight
And hide from tomorrows

Its quiet now
Whispers confess
Now that I find myself in here
I realize Im yours

Can we run away now
And hide from tomorrow

Can we run away tonight
And hide from tomorrows

Now that I find myself in here
I realize Im yours
