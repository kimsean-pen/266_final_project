Do it now, you know who you are.
You feel it in your heart
And you're burning with ambition

At first, wait, won't get it on a plate
You're gonna have to work for it
Harder and harder

And I know 'cause I've been there before
Knocking on the doors with rejection
And you'll see 'cause if it's meant to be
Nothing can compare to deserving your dream

It's amazing, it's amazing
All that you can do
It's amazing, makes my heart sing
Now it's up to you

Patience, now frustrations in the air
And people who don't care
Well, it's gonna get you down

And you'll fall, yes you will hit a wall
But get back on your feet
And you'll be stronger and smarter

And I know 'cause I've been there before
Knocking down the doors, won't take no for an answer
And you'll see 'cause if it's meant to be
Nothing can compare to deserving your dream

It's amazing, it's amazing
All that you can do
It's amazing, makes my heart sing
Now it's up to you

Don't be embarrassed, don't be afraid
Don't let your dreams slip away
Determination using your gift
Everybody has a gift

Never give up, never let it die
Trust your instincts and most importantly
You've got nothing to lose
So just go for it
it's amazing, it's amazing
All that you can do
It's amazing, makes my heart sing
Now it's up to you
It's amazing, it's amazing
All that you can do
It's amazing, makes my heart sing
Now it's up to you
