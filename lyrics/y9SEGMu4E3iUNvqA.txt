Girl
You've been forgetting
Just how special
You really are
And

I try to remind you

But sometimes I can't find you
But the truth is in your heart
So write

A note to yourself
Girl
Don't beat yourself up
Your best is good enough

So pick the pen up
And write
A note to yourself

A note to yourself
A don't be cruel
'Cause things

Do happen
And you know it's not your fault
Don't cover your wounds
With this song

Girl
Leat me tell you what I see
You've got to believe me

You're a thing of beauty
Girl
Put it in an envelope

Put it in the post
It'll come back to your door
And read
A note to yourself
A note to yourself
Don't be cruel
'Cause things
Do happen
And you know it's not your fault
Don't cover your wounds
With this song
And write
A note to self
And read
A note to yourself
A note to yourself
