Going through life, the righteous way
The only way so the preacher would say
You put me on the Jericho road
Barefoot and smiling,standing there by the piano

Well I dream that I heard that whippoorwill sing
Yeah she sang my song and called me by name
Well I hung my head in shame,Oh yeah

You sewed my years together like a patchwork quilt
Your bougainvillea's bloomed it'll never wilt.
Lessons I remember and some that I forgot
are precious and pure like one honeysuckle drop.

Well I dream that I heard that whippoorwill sing
Yeah she sang my song and called me by name
Well I hung my head in shame,Oh yeah

I'm gonna sing that song with the Whippoorwill
In a sweet high harmony
Though I know just what went with her
She's always here with me
Always here with me

Well I dream that I heard that whippoorwill sing
Yeah she sang my song and called me by name
Well I dream that I heard that whippoorwill sing
Yeah she sang my song and called me by name

Well I dream that I heard that whippoorwill sing
Yeah she sang my song and called me by name
Well I dream that I heard that whippoorwill sing
Yeah she sang my song and called me by name

Starting all over again
Yes I'm starting all over again
