I woke up on my roof with my brothers
There's a whale in the pool with my mother
And my dad paints the house different colors
Where would we be, if we couldn't dream?

And I know, we get a little crazy
And I know, we get a little loud
And I know, we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free
We are more than you think
So call us freaks but that's just the way we roll

You got moves, I've got shoes
Let's go dancing
Pop and lock, battle dance against Hanson (battle dance)
If we lose all the girls, they'll be laughing
Where would we be, if we couldn't dream?

And I know, we get a little crazy
And I know, we get a little loud
And I know, we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free
We are more than you think
So call us freaks, 'cause, that's just the way we roll

'Cause, we're old enough to know
We're never letting go
'Cause, that's just the way we roll

'Cause, I know, we get a little crazy
And I know, we get a little loud
And I know, we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free
We are more than you think
So call us freaks, 'cause, that's just the way we roll

And I know, we get a little crazy
And I know, we get a little loud
And I know, we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free
We are more than you think
So call us freaks, 'cause, that's just the way we roll
That's just the way we roll
Oh, that's just the way we roll
