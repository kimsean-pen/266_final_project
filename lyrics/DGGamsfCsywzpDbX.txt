Ravished from our paradise
A crack in the mirror
I know who's to blame
So full of life but paralyzed
Etched on my iris
But I try not to think of it all...

We swore to god in veritas
And burned our skin like it burned our souls
One dealt with grief by causing pain
She hid behind maple and built her own fortress of sound

Hear this melody almost forgotten

Hush
I've been waiting a lifetime to show you
You're returning to heaven
Like dust to dust
I've been waiting forever to witness your fading
Like ashes to ashes.

Forbidden dance on fragile skin
Why do you shine as I suffer in pain?
The greatest scars remain within
Leaving you now with a heart black as cardinal sin.

Fear this melody almost forgotten

Hush
I've been waiting a lifetime to show you
You're returning to heaven
Like dust to dust
I've been waiting forever to witness your fading
Like ashes to ashes!

Hate... My solution...
Fate... An illusion.
