You are the one, in your concrete arms I adore you
Dirty and dear, block out the sun
In your twists and turns I invade
You show me no fear

We blow around like tiny leaves in a big storm
Finding there's nothing left to breathe or to keep warm
You ebb and flow and your rhythm beats my head
Leave me alone while you swallow up the dead

You are the one, you cradle me and kill, caressing my face
Leave me undone, you suffocate and have me, this is the place
Every door conceals a dream and a nightmare
Nothing is ever really pure in the stale air

And when it's dark everything becomes more clear
Lie in the park when I want to have you near

You are the one, in your concrete arms I adore you
Dusty and dear, block out the sun
In your twists and turns I invade
You show me no fear

Left it unsung, I shall leave but I'll return
Poison my lungs, my blood is full of lead
Things unsaid, my love for you still burns
