You starve your children on neglect
Then feed their bellies with fear (bellies with fear)
Concussion bat to the brain
Witness to a battered mother (battered mother)

Your abuse will end right here
No longer will your family fear (no longer will your family fear)
A gunshot to the head of trepidation (trepidation)
My promise if you ever lay a finger

Just look at the scars you make
Your terror makes your kids break (make your kids break)
A broken home, just as you were raised
With fists raised up to your children

Your abuse will end right here
No longer will your family fear (no longer will your family fear)
A gunshot to the head of trepidation (trepidation)
My promise if you ever lay a finger

This battle is on all
You've made beautiful, now hateful
You wretched life wrecker, abuser
Now suffer

Open fire, on the desire of the man
Open fire, with strife we'll strike down the hand
If I can't make you see the damage you've made
I'll make you wish you'd never been alive

Open fire, on the desire of the man
Open fire, with strife we'll strike down the hand
Open fire, on the desire of the man
Open fire, with strife, we'll strike down the hand
If I can't make you see the damage you've made
I'll make you wish you'd never been alive
