I woke up today with this feeling
That better things are coming my way
And if the sunshine has a meaning
Telling me not to let things get in my way

When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying
Ahhhh...
Never let go gotta hold on and
Non stop 'til the break of dawn and
Keep on moving, don't stop rocking Ahhhh...

Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
We'll keep on movin' on anyway

Feels like I should be screaming
Trying to get through to my friends
Sometimes it feels that life has no meaning
But I know things will be alright in the end

When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying
Ahhhh...
Never let go gotta hold on and
Non stop 'til the break of dawn and
Keep on moving, don't stop rocking Ahhhh...

Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
We'll keep on movin' on anyway

When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying
Ahhhh...
Never let go gotta hold on and
Non stop 'til the break of dawn and
Keep on moving, don't stop rocking Ahhhh...

Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
We'll keep on movin' on anyway
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
We'll keep on movin' on anyway
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
We'll keep on movin' on anyway
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
We'll keep on movin' on anyway
Get on up
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
I know it's not much
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
