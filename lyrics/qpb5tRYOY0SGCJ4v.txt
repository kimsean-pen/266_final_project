Uh
Yeah
I could wait all night and day
To go to a party sit down and wait
Give my request to the Dj
'Cause my song he's gotta play
And when I hear that beat
I get my body up out my seat
I grab a guy and move my feet
He's playin' my song
Play

Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn it on
Play

'Cause I wanna be dancin' all night long
Won't you play my play my play my play my play my favorite song
I don't care if everybody's gone
Turn it up 'cause it turns me on
Keep dancin' all night long
It feels so right that it can't be wrong
(be wrong)
I get chills up and down my spine
Whenever I hear that song of mine
When it stops better press rewind

Let me hear it one more t-i-m-e...
