Reckless mom has got a dream machine
She's cruising the silver lining
Burning rubber, making red go green
With her daughter's arms out flying
They held together with no master plan
Whatever happens yeah she knows she can
She cut the static and a lookout man
'Cause you're leaving us all behind

Hey there, we can ride against the wind
Lady, we will ride again

Cosmic Kelly works the wrecking ball
Feeling whole she can't help but fall in
Freedom dancing when she's on her own
Here's the music of the road calling
Well Angelina tells it different now
She crossed her heart 'cause she soon forgot
Yeah every loser takes another shot
Saddle up, leave it all behind

Hey there, we can ride against the wind
Lady, we will ride again
Hey there, we can ride against the wind
Oh hey now, we will ride again

Little Raven she's a renegade
Born leader of the maiden's way
She pulled me closer just to turn insane
Now ladies, let us ride

Hey there, we can ride against the wind
Lady, we will ride again
Hey there, we can ride against the wind
Oh hell yeah, we will ride again
