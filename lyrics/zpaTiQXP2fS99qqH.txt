In the cold gray room
One afternoon
One afternoon
What are you gonna do?
Having your way, but there's nothing new

You took a beautiful thing
Pull off a wing
Pull off a wing
A safety pin
It never shone quite as bright again

But you haven't told me anything
That I didn't already know
No, you haven't said a single thing
That I didn't already know

It's a thing I love
Stuck in the mud
Stuck in the mud
Stuck in a rut
Am I a piece in your puzzle or a paper cut?

Same time next week
A kiss on the cheek
Kiss on the cheek
And say after me
Everything's tied up nice and neat

But you haven't told me anything
That I didn't already know
No, you haven't sold me anything
That I didn't already know

I feel for you
I really do
Nothing turns out
Like you want it too
No words can mend
This fix I'm in
Hearing those words
That I'll never play
Right between the eyes
I don't feel a thing

'Cause you haven't told me anything
That I didn't already know
No, you haven't said a single thing
That I didn't already know

No, you haven't told me anything
No, you haven't told me anything
No, you haven't told me anything
No, you haven't told me anything
