Waiter send this to the table, the party of one
The only other lonely soul in this place
And so you're finishing up your coffee
But then where you're gonna run?
Where'd you get that look on your face?

You should always let the sun go down on your anger
Let it burn you to sleep
Bring it closer to danger
To surrender and retreat
Sing your sad soul to sleep

I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
But I am tired
And I am yours

Don't even think about your freedom
Or taking that flight
Or going back upon your promise after fighting for the right
Because your eggshells and your right statements
And your weaponized words
Are paper tigers now

Oh your constant overthinking and your secretive drinking
Are making you more and more alone
And girl, you can slam the door behind you
It ain't ever gonna close
Because when you're home, you're already home

I am tired
I am tired
I don't wanna go home anymore
I don't wanna throw stones anymore
I don't wanna take part in the war

I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still

I don't wanna be right anymore
Lord, I don't wanna fight anymore
I'm not taking your side anymore
I am tired
I am not my own
And I am leaving
Oh, I am tired
And I'm coming home

'Cause I am yours,
I am yours, I am yours,
I am yours, I am yours
I am yours,
I am yours, I am yours
I am yours, I am yours
