Ah.
Don't want to work away
Doin' just what they all say.
Work hard, boy, and
You'll find
One day you'll have a job like mine.

'Cause I know for sure
Nobody should be that poor.
You say yes and
Sink low
Because you happen to say so, say so.
You say so.

I don't want to work away
Doin' just what they all say.
Work hard, boy, and
You'll find
One day you'll have a job like mine, job like mine.
A job like mine.

Be wise. Look ahead.
Use your eyes, he said.
Be straight. Think right,
But I might die tonight.
Ah.
Ah.
