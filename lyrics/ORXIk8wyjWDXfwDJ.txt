Knock knock knock
On the palace door I hear
What you want know?

Tik tik tok
For a little luck I need
This song to come on out

Hey
Affirmative what do I gain?
Affirmative it is a game?

Secret paths in your hands
That you hold
Will unfold
You're like a music box hiding a tune
For there is a meaning
In your wish and being
And every path you take
Leads up to truth

Tik tak tok
Can you hear the clock ticking?
More with your heart now?
To unlock What it is it inside the box
Keys are all around

Hey
Let the wish inside you grow
Open up and let it go

Secret paths in your hands
That you hold
Will unfold
You're like a music box hiding a tune
For there is a meaning
In your wish and being
And every path you take
Leads up to truth

To unlock it
Make your cat find it
To unclock it
Make your cat a bandit
To unlock it
You should see answers
To unlock it
Be a bit offensive

To unlock it
Make your cat find it
To unlock it
Make your cat a bandit

Secret paths in your hands
That you hold
Will unfold
You're like a music box hiding a tune
For there is a meaning
In your wish and being
And every path you take
Leads up to truth

Secret paths in your hands
That you hold
Will unfold
You're like a music box hiding a tune
For there is a meaning
In your wish and being
In your wish and being
