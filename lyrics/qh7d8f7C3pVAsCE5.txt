You lower your hand, clarinet will play
Raise it back up and it flies away
When you smile violins will soar
When you move your legs timpani will roar

I can hear it, I can hear it, I can hear it, I swear
All the music you're provoking, filling up the air
It's getting louder

This is the sound of an orchestra
I can hear it playing everywhere that you are
There is a sound for everything you do
This is the sound of my love for you
Listen to the sound of my lust for you

It's getting louder
It's getting louder
It's getting louder
There is a sound for everything you do
Listen to the sound of my love for you

You don't even know everything I hear
Every move every nod, every time you're near
If I close my eyes, promise I can see
A hundred people playing and it's just for me

I can hear it, I can hear it, I can hear it, I swear
All the music you're provoking filling up the air
It's getting louder

This is the sound of an orchestra
I can hear it playing everywhere that you are
There is a sound for everything you do
This is the sound of my love for you
Listen to the sound of my lust for you

It's getting louder
It's getting louder
It's getting louder
There is a sound for everything you do
Listen to the sound of my love for you

Before you even say what I know you're gonna say
That all the sounds I hear are only in my head
Come stand really close, hold me like you do
Then all the music in my head you'll hear

This is the sound of an orchestra
I can hear it playing everywhere that you are
There is a sound for everything you do
This is the sound of my love for you
Listen to the sound of my lust for you

It's getting louder
It's getting louder
It's getting louder
There is a sound for everything you do
Listen to the sound of my love for you
