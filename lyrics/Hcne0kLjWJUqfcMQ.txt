The night is starting here we go
(I check out everything)
This is our time to lose control
(What do you want from me)
You line them up we'll put them down
This is so frustrating
To watch you sleezing all around
Yet you keep on smiling

What can I do to make you see?
(You're guilty)
What can I do to make you feel?
(You're wanted)
What can I do to make you see?
(You're guilty)
I'm suffocating under words of sorrow

Her skin reflects behind the blur
I'm intoxicated
Where am I from? Why am I here?
(You're so predictable)
Fingers running through my hair
But its all just fiction
She stripped down from her underwear
So beautiful

What can I do to make you see?
(You're guilty)
What can I do to make you feel?
(You're wanted)
What can I do to make you see?
(You're guilty)
I'm suffocating under words of sorrow

Go!

(There's bodies lying on the floor)
But I keep on staring...
(My world is over, close the door)

Her skin reflects behind the blur
I'm intoxicated
Where am I from? Why am I here?
(You're so predictable)
Fingers running through my hair
I'm a new addiction
She stripped down from her underwear
So beautiful

What can I do to make you see?
(You're guilty)
What can I do to make you feel?
(You're wanted)
What can I do to make you see?
(You're guilty)
I'm suffocating under words of sorrow
(Words of sorrow)
