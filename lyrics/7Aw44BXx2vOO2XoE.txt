Mug mug mug
Coffee mug
Gonna clear away the haze
Liquid proof
That I can win this race
Coffee mug
The grip that keeps me tall
My inter-link
Keeps me questing all

I don't need no booze or drugs
I just chug-a-lug-o my coffee mug
And I don't need your kiss and hug
I just chug-a-lug-o my coffee mug

They haven't banned
My liquid drug of choice
There's too many hooked
And they've got too much voice
So for the moment
We're all pretty good to go
With 98 cups
With 98 more to go

I don't need no booze or drugs
I just chug-a-lug-o my coffee mug
And I don't need your kiss and hug
I just chug-a-lug-o my coffee mug

Here a bean, there a bean
Everywhere a mean mean bean

Chug - a - lug - o - my
Coffee - mug, mug, mug, mug
