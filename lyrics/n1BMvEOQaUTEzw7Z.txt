Funny how the wheel has turned
Taking cards from you but all on your turn
Funny how the wheel has turned
Taking cards from you but all on your turn
Feel at home
Got nothing to say but that's okay
Leave me alone
Is on top of a list of words thought
Got nothing to show
It's all circling back to what's not there
Leave me alone
Is all I can account for
X amount of patience
Save a motivation
Rights of allocation
Seeking validation
Unbending
Immobile
Unending from the get-go
Bad engine
Now totalled
Drive sideways
But I know that I don't
Feel at home
Got nothing to say but that's okay
Leave me alone

Got nothing to show
It's all circling back to what's not there
Leave me alone
