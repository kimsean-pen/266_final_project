I been so low
Felt the wind blow
Like I was a screen door
In a thunderstorm

Yeah I've been down
I've been laid out
But you always were
What I came here for

Waiting all day
Waiting all day
Just for my say
For a bell to ring
For the first sting

Yeah I been blue
That ain't nothing new
It's you my friend
You're why I get up again

I've make mistakes
I've been hard hit
I say so what
So what if I did
I'm the clear eyed
I'm the
Comeback
The kid
Start it over
Start it over again
I'm the clear eyed
I'm the comeback kid

It's been a rough year
Been some tough tears
I've lost so fast
All that I had

But when it's time to
I will fight for you
Cause you know you are are
Why I've come so far

I've make mistakes
I've been hard hit
I say so what
So what if I did
I'm the clear eyed
I'm the
Comeback
The kid
Start it over
Start it over again
I'm the clear eyed
I'm the comeback kid
