Lowered winding look, and obscure wet sound
The more swirling the more craze in your dance
Winding slowly you gave a gaze
It's partly because you are weak
Isn't it better to have your fingers
in your mouth?
Lies coming near, I think I am going to be broken up
Throwing away all the mirrors tack them back of the door
Anyway after some violent moments you'd be cracked
It won't take too long for you to stop
You'll vomit,trying to seize a headless image of future
I'll open the door
And I'll stub you
That will fill your fantasy
Hey I'll penetrate it
