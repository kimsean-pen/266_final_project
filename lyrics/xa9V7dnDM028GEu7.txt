Tell me everything and hold no lies
Say you're waiting for better skies
Were you mad as hell when you realized
All the little things, which we rely?

Hoping, praying
Working every day to get my mind right
Wasting borrowed time
Where were you when I was lost so far from trying?

Oh, but honey don't taste like summer no more
Stick around now, miss you every night
Now, we could pass time moving left and right
Think about when life goes by all within a day

Tell me everything and hold no lies
Say you're waiting for better skies
Were you mad as hell when you realized
All the little things, which we rely?

Ooh, I've been
Hoping (hoping), praying (praying)
Working every day to get my mind right
Wasting borrowed time
Where were you when I was lost so far from trying?

Oh, but honey don't taste like summer no more
Stick around now, miss you every night
Now, we could pass time moving left and right
Think about when life goes by all within a day

Honey don't taste like summer no more
Ooh, it don't taste like summer no more
Ooh, it don't taste like summer no more
Summer no more, summer no more

Ooh, it don't taste like summer no more
Ooh, it don't taste like summer no more
Ooh, it don't taste like summer no more
Summer no more, yeah, summer no more

Oh, but honey don't taste like summer no more
Stick around now, I miss you every night
We could pass time moving left and right
Think about when life goes by all within a day

Oh, but honey don't taste like summer no more
Stick around now, I miss you every night
We could pass time moving left and right
Think about when life goes by all within a day

Honey don't taste like summer no more
Ooh, it don't taste like summer no more
Ooh, it don't taste like summer no more
Ooh, it don't taste like summer no more
Summer no more, summer no more

Ooh, it don't taste like summer no more
Ooh, it don't taste like summer no more
Ooh, it don't taste like summer no more
Summer no more, summer no more
