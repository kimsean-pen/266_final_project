You told me not to take a look
Never thought this could happen
Here we are on an open sea
With no way to go back
You hold me as you shiver
The coral beneath us glows
There's so much to discover
All my senses are numb

And a storm is rising
The blood rushes and the current swirls
Lungs full about to burst
Like a pulley of a hundred ropes
As you come back up for the next breath
The ocean is at war
Reckless, scattered and torn
There is everything to fear my love
The tide is out and the fight is up
No more tired resistance
The storm is closer than you ever thought
So come on we've got to find our
Own way out this shipwreck on an ocean of doubt

Take the wheel but you cannot steer
You can see it but it isn't real
Buried under a thousand tons
Crushed by the weight of love
It can't be what you thought
It can't be what you saw
Still you fight for what was never lost
It's gonna happen when you know it's not

No more tragic endings
I'm done trying to hide the holes
Seal my flood defenses
The storm is raging but I feel your love
So come on
We've got to find our own way
Out this shipwreck on an ocean of doubt
