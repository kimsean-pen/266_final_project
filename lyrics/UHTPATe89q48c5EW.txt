I knew as soon as I saw you
Baby, baby, baby
Later you want me to love you
Sorry, sorry
I can't stay away
You can't stay away
From me, from me
I let you in on a secret
Baby, baby, baby
Oh, listen to me baby you're the one
You hit me bang bang
Shoot me down with your gun
I'm dealing with?
And I won
Listen to me baby you're the one
You hit me bang bang
Shoot me down with your gun
I'm dealing with?
And I won
One
One more time
Let's just do it one more time
One
One more time
Let's just go there one more time
Listen to me baby you're the one
You hit me bang bang
Shoot me down with your gun
I'm dealing with?
And I won
Listen to me baby you're the one
You hit me bang bang
Shoot me down with your gun
I'm dealing with?
And I won
Two, three, four
Let's get it all out
In the open
Let's get it all out
Get, get it all out
Let's get it all out
In the open
Let's get it all out
Get, get it all out
Let's just go there one last time
Listen to me baby you're the one
You hit me bang bang
Shoot me down with your gun
I'm dealing with?
And I won
Listen to me baby you're the one
You hit me bang bang
Shoot me down with your gun
I'm dealing with?
And I won
