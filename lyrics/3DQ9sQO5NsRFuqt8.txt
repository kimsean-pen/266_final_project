Done me wrong
Done all wrong
All the wrong I've done
I'm sure I'll live quite long

Done all wrong
Done me wrong
All the wrong I've done
I'm sure I'll live quite, quite long

All the wrong I've done
Will be undone in song
All the wrong I've done
Will be undone in song

If you're doing wrong
If you've done all wrong
You can rest assure
You're gonna live quite long

If you've done all wrong
You're doing wrong
You can rest assure
You're gonna live quite, quite long

All the wrong you've done
Will be undone in song
All the wrong you've done
Will be undone in song

We're doing wrong
We've all done wrong
If we do no wrong
I'm sure we would be gone
