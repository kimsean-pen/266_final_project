Heard about my past
Things I used to do
The games I used to play
The girls that didn't last
I know what's on your mind
You think I'm doing wrong
Can I say what is real
You are the only one
When I'm not around
Do you think of me
Or what the jealous ones
Are claiming me to be
You should know by now
That it's gonna take
A lot of trust from you
For us to make it through

You should know baby you're my angel
Nothing's gonna make you fall from heaven
Girl I just want to love you Love you

Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about you and me
Put it out your mind cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here
Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about you and me
Put it out your mind cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here

Girl lets talk about
What your friends told you
That I'm a selfish man
Want my cake and eat it to
Maybe in my past
But you changed me now
Now that I've learned to love
It's you that showed me how
Your love so real
I'd be a fool to play
Play around on you
I want to stay with you
You should know by now
That it's gonna take
A lot of trust from you
For us to make it through

You should know baby you're my angel
Nothing's gonna make you fall from heaven
Girl I just want to love you Love you

Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about you and me
Put it out your mind cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here
Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about you and me
Put it out your mind cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here

Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about you and me
Put it out your mind cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here
Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about you and me
Put it out your mind cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here
