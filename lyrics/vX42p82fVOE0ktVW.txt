It's time to get moving,
time for us to have some fun
There's no time to hang around
Our adventure's just begun
We'll be thinking 'bout our friends as we chase the setting sun
but we're leaving them behind,
we're on the run.

We're on the run
I don't care about what all the others say
(we're on the run)
Well I guess there are some things that will just never go away, I
(we're on the run)
wish that I could see that there's no better place than home
But home's a place that I have never known
That's why we're on the run
