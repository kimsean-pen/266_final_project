I've seen that same look
In your eyes before
It ain't good for you
It ain't good for me
It ain't good for nobody else
Lord knows i've done my share
Plus a whole lot more
Now you're through with me
But i'll stay true to you
You see I ain't got nobody else
And time flies
You'd better not let it run away from you
You'll never get it back now
So take me back now
Can't you see i ain't got nothing left
Baby but you, you, you
You'll never get it back now
So take me back now
Can't you see i ain't got nothing left
Baby it's true, true, so true
You'll never get it back now
So take me back now
Can't you see i ain't got nothing left baby but you
Can't stop thinking about
The moment you walked out that door
Wasn't good for me
Wasn't good for you
Wasn't good for nobody else
And Lord knows I've done my share
But lords also knows
That you don't care
He told me watch your step
And hold the line
Can't you see
You're wasting your time
