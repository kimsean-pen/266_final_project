I've been a disappointment from time to time
I'm prone to swing at mirrors
I interrupt slow talkers
And I need everyone to like me

But I won't fail you when I walk out on the wire
No I won't fail you when I walk out on the wire
No I won't fail you when I walk out on the wire
No I won't fail you when I walk out on the wire

There's nothin' I can say but "I'm sorry" now
I'll try to make it up to you somehow
But I'm no better than I'll ever be
I'm just a beggar down here on my knees

I won't fail you when I walk out on the wire
No I won't fail you when I walk out on the wire
No I won't fail you when I walk out on the wire
No I won't fail you when I walk out on the wire

It's weighed and
It's measured
It is the sum of all of life's
Sufferin' and pleasures
And it's laid out
For the taking
And the song is the sound
Of your heart breaking
Are you listenin'
I'm listenin'

No I won't fail you when I walk out on the wire
No I won't fail you when I walk out on the wire
No I won't fail you when I walk out on the wire
No I won't fail you when I walk out on the wire
