There's nothing I could explain
That your mother couldn't explain to you
White lips [?] your lips
There's nothing to figure out
That you couldn't figure out
Some high tips from where I live
Maybe I could do without
You stringing up your doubt
Like my tongue around my house
Maybe I could do without
Your memories on the wall
All the nights that I can recall
Keep my time like the time before

Nothing to do
So give me you
Nothing to do
Then I do

There's nothing left here to want
[?}
But your lips on my lips
There's nothing that I could explain
Stop spinning up again
So I'm speaking through my teeth
And leave everything be a thief
A memory in the wall
All the bodies that line the hall
Keep my time like the time before

Nothing to do
So give me you
Nothing to do
Then I do

Nothing to do
There's nothing that I couldn't say
There's nothing that I could
Stick it to better days
Stick it to better
There's nothing that I could say
To take it to better days

Nothing to do
So give me you
Nothing to do
So give me you
Nothing to do
