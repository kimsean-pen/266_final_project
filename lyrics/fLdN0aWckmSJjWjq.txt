There are days I might not make it
There are days I might start brakin'
When the rains starts coming down as heavy as the air
You can find me dancing with the spirits in the square
GOD DAMN I SWEAR

There are times I feel like givin' in

There are times I begin to begin again

Look outside the world keeps spinnin' like a paddle wheel
Rolling for the broken hearted waiting on the hill
You know I'm not in the clear

You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
In the clear
There are places I don't remember
There are faces I don't remember

How could I forget you painted stars into the sky
Coming like a reaper marching in the second line
You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
In the clear

And if I should drown
May this be the sound
To wash me out
You know I'm not in the clear

You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
In the clear
In the clear
