My eyes are stinging
My ears are ringing
My hands are tied and
I can't get out of here

My thighs are chafing
My back is breaking
My feet are stuck
I want to get the fuck out of here now

Get on your hobby horse
Get on your hobby horse
Get on your hobby horse
And get out of here

Their tongues are licking
Their noses sniffing
Pack on the loose but I can't let them in here
My fears are growing
My wounds are showing
My time is up
I want to get the fuck out of here now
