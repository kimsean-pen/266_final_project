Hey now honey
I gotta face the floor
You headed for the heart
But you couldn't find the door, could you?
Could you?

Well I'm standing in the sun
I'm living in the rain
I gotta get a whirlin'
Like a human hurricane over you

Over you
Now you're lookin' like a fox on the run
And you're faster than a shot from a gun
I'm pointin' at you, oh oh you
I'm talking 'bout you, hey you
I thought we had love in store

You keep on knockin' on every door
Babe I seen it all before
You keep on knockin' on every door
Ain't no lovin' you ignore
You keep on knockin' on every door
Keep, keep, knock, knockin' on every door
You keep on knockin' on every door
Hey now honey

Time is all you spent
You move into the bed
But you couldn't pay the rent, could you?
In the twinkle of an eye

You electrify
I gotta get a shootin'
Like a rocket in the sky, bye bye
Goodbye

Now you're burnin' like you're hot on the scene
Don't you love to steal a part of my dream?
I'm lookin' at you, oh oh you
I'm talkin' 'bout you, yea you
I thought we had love in store
You keep on knockin' on every door

Babe I seen it all before
You keep on knockin' on every door
Ain't no sugar you ignore
You keep on knockin' on every door
Keep, keep, knock, knockin' on every door
You keep on knockin' on every door
(Yea)
I thought we had love in store

You keep on knockin' on every door
Babe I seen it all before
You keep on knockin' on every door
Ain't no sugar you ignore
You keep on knockin' on every door
Keep, keep, knock, knockin' on every door
You keep on knockin' on every door
I thought we used to have love in store

You keep on knockin' on every door
Hey babe don't run around here no more
You keep on knockin' on every door
Ain't no sugar you ignore
You keep on knockin' on every door
Keep, keep, knock, knockin' on every door
You keep on knockin' on every door
(You better learn your lesson now)
Keep, keep
Keep, keep
Keep, keep
Keep, keep
