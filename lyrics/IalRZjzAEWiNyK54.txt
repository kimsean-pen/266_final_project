Home, is all familiar ways
They're coming back to haunt me
Come back and go away
Delirium don't take itself so seriously
I know you're better than that
Better than
And I won't keep you, until last one
I know that your leaving soon
Underwater in the bathroom
Stay until equilibrium
This is called a conversation
Maybe i spoke too soon
I've been waiting for the bad news
Ever since it all began
Home, is all familiar ways
I sent the invitation
just to feel again
Aquarium
it's never been so clear to me
I never sink when I swim
So i gotta, swim away√ó4
And I won't' keep you until last one
I know that your leaving soon
Underwater in the bathroom
Stay until equilibrium
If this is called a competition
Darling you would always win
I've been waiting for the bad news
Ever since it all began
It all began, oh
And I'll be the the the best
the worst, the first
The last case of curse you didn't curse
When we landed in the sharp glass
This thing [?] I rehearsed
So i am not merciful
because forcing just hurts
And if you understand familiar
Than you'll understand the voice
I'll be the best,
the worst, the first
The last case of curse you didn't curse
When we landed in the sharp glass
This thing [?] I rehearsed
So i am not merciful because
Forcing just hurts
And if you understand familiar
Than you'll understand the voice
