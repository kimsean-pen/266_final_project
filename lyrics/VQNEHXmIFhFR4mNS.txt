I had a dream, or was it real?
We crossed the line and it was on
(We crossed the line, it was on this time)
I've been denying how I feel
You've been denying what you want
(You want from me, talk to me baby)

I want some satisfaction, take me to the stars
Just like, "ahhh"
A-a-ahhh!

I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

Cancel your reservations
No more hesitations, this is on
(Can't make it stop, give me all you got)
I want it all or nothing
No more in-between, now give your
(Everything to me, let's get real baby)

A chemical reaction, take me in your arms
And make me, "ahhh"
A-a-ahhh!

I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

Take me to emotion, I want to go all the way
Show me devotion and take me all the way
Take me to emotion, I want to go all the way
Show me devotion and take me all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way
Take me all the way, a-a-ahhh!

I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

I wanna cut through the clouds
Mmm, cut to the feeling
I wanna dance on the roof, oh oh oh, yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, I wanna cut to the feeling
I wanna cut to the feeling, I wanna cut to the feeling
