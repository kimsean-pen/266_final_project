Ooh, Ooh, Ooh
I can hear the truck tires coming up the gravel road
But its not like him to drive that slow, when nothings on the radio
Footsteps on the front porch, I hear my doorbell
He usually comes right in, now I can tell
Here comes goodbye, here comes the last time
here comes me wishing things had never changed
And he was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye
I can hear him say I love you like it was yesterday
And I can see it written on his face that he had never felt this way
One day I thought he'd see me with my daddy by my side
And violins would play, here comes the bride
But here comes goodbye, here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain, here comes me wishing things would never change
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye
Why does it have to go from good to gone?
Before the lights turn on, yeah and you're left alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh
But here comes goodbye
Here comes goodbye, here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain, here comes me wishing things would never change
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye
