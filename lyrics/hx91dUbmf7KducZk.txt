You're on the breeze
You rest in grey
Eternally sleep
Erase the day
I couldn't see her
Through all the rain
And her sigh
Holding our breath to the end

We end up far away
Out on the breeze
Take me past the horizon
We're running out of time

Anywhere is nowhere
Everywhere is fear
And you just
All the walls of my gloomy house?
It's like awaiting
The end of the world
Here in this days?
The end of the world

There is no answer
To all that is crying
When all those die
To carry on forever
