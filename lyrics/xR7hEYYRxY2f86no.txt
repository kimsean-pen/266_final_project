here we go around the world
we spin around on the turnstiles
we create

here we are in caravan
blinders up high were the dreamers

and don't forget you're the only one
(you're the only one)
you hold your kite on a string

don't sleep too long
cause everything you need is right here
don't sleep too long
pleasant dreams but please don't sleep too long
everything you need is right here
don't sleep too long
pleasant dreams but please don't sleep too long

here we are in candyland
one million dreams are realizing everyday
here we are in apples corps
four million feet walk right by me everyday
here we are in old New York
ten million eyes stare right through me

and don't forget you're not the only one
(not the only one)
who turned your life all around?
