Не проси меня, я не буду танцевать...
Не проси меня...
\Don't ask me to dance, I won't\

Nobody knows you're here
Deep undercover
You seem a bit afraid
Why do you suffer?

Another night
A night in Alphaville

This time is made for love
Let's play together
In every bar and club
Now and forever

Another night
A night in Alphaville

You say you won't
For girl I know you will

I'm hungry for your lies
You scream and whisper
A thousand alibies
You point the finger

Another night
A night in Alphaville

Don't try to read my mind
A broken circuit
Her on my hands are tied
Nobody's perfect

Another night
A night in Alphaville

You say you won't
But girl I know you will

The world goes 'round
But here it stays the same
In Second Class
Nobody knows your name

Another night
A night in Alphaville

You say you won't
But girl I know you will
I wanna live
But life ain't worth a dime
Lasting and light
Reflected in your eyes

Another night
A night in Alphaville
