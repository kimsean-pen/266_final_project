I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
I'm every woman, it's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z
(Woah, woah, woah)
(Woah, woah, woah)

I can cast a spell
Of secrets you can't tell
Mix a special brew
Put fire inside of you
But anytime you feel
Danger or fear
Instantly I will appear, 'cause

I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
(Woah, woah, woah)
(Woah, woah, woah)

I can sense your needs
Like rain unto the seeds
I can make a rhyme
Of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down
To some good old fashioned love
That's what I've got plenty of, 'cause

I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
I'm every woman, it's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z
(Woah, woah, woah)
(Woah, woah, woah)

I ain't braggin' 'cause I'm the one
You just ask me ooh and it shall be done
And don't bother to compare
'Cause I've got it
I've got it, I've got it, yeah, I...

I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman (Woah, oh, oh, oh)
I'm every woman (Woah, woah, woah)
I'm every woman (Woah, woah, woah)
I'm every woman (Woah, woah, woah)
I'm every woman (Woah, woah, woah)

I'm every woman (Woah, woah, woah)
I'm every woman (Woah, woah, woah)
I'm every woman (Woah, woah, woah)
I'm every woman (Woah, woah, woah)
I'm every woman (Woah, woah, woah)
