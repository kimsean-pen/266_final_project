So long
My sweet love
I miss you
More than you'll ever know
Goodbye my moonlight
The sun's up and
I will rise from you

The sun and the moon
The sun and the moon
Where worlds depart

Daybreak to heartache
My moon boy
Has left me all alone
Tears flow a salty river
Falling
On and on and on

The sun and the moon
The sun and the moon
Where worlds depart

Maybe one day will come
When all is quiet
Two stars they will collide
Dream made
Our dark cascade
The world drifts
Lost in our lovely eclipse

The moon on the sun
The moon on the sun
Together as one

The moon on the sun
The moon on the sun
Together as one
