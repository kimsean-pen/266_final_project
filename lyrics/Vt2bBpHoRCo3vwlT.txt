Blue snow may fall in your dreams, baby
But let me tell you those dreams come true
Hard to believe as it seems, baby
This wonderland was just built for me and you

A crimson ocean for you, baby
We're trippin' to the rainbow's end again
A star shaped cloud lined with blue, baby
We'll build a sky for the summer rain

'Cos when the dream is over
Blue snow will fall on you
'Cos when the dream is over
Blue snow will fall on you

Red sunshine lights up your dreams, baby
But let me tell you those dreams come true
And all this madness can mean is, baby
That all the snow in your hand is blue

Just one more sip of the wine, baby
We'll take a swim in the seas of love
'Cos now you know that you're mine, baby
I'll show you things you've been dreaming of

'Cos when the dream is over
Blue snow will fall on you
'Cos when the dream is over
Blue snow will fall on you
