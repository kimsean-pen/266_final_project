When about midnight roosters at the hip tight
Played the blues with Cool Kite
Shot a round with Heather Smite
Mixed my drinks with Mia Town
Smoked hip hop with Roger Down
Dulled the lights from 5th Ave
Played the colours Jonny Par

Down at Delta Bay
Down at Delta Bay
A chord a light a paralight abyss
New tricks in moonlight
Sad sumo, a silly sea

Counting truth death in a Hollywood scene
Rimmed shot, joked lot heard the point of towns

Then I got a phone call
I saw you on the new shore
Tapping teeth in lifestyle
Moving guards like Tim Know
When I got a phone call
I saw you on new show
Tapping teeth in lifestyle
Tapping teeth in lifestyle

A chord a light a paralight abyss
New tricks in moonlight
Sad sumo, a silly sea

Counting truth death in a Hollywood scene
Rimmed shot, joked lot heard the point of towns cup
Leant back
Flipped up
Met the mayor for drinks up
Had a smoke, angry yoke who spoke in tongues and dreamed a lot

Never been to nowhere town always knew the mind in dock
