I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, oh
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

There's nothing holdin' me back, no no no no
There's nothing holdin' me back

She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
Sing it out
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, oh
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
Take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright
I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd (be alright)
(I know we would) Louder (be alright)

'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright
We would be alright

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
Take all my inhibitions
There's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Sing it out
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
No no no no
There's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back

Thank you so much
Thank you
