Maybe when the room is empty
Maybe when the bottle's full
Maybe when the door gets broke down love can break in
Maybe when I'm done with thinking
Maybe you can think me whole
Maybe when I'm done with endings this can begin
This can begin
This can begin

If you could be my Punk Rock Princess
I would be your Garage Band King
You could tell me why you just don't fit in
And how your gonna be something

Maybe when your hair gets darker
Maybe when your eyes get wide
Maybe when the walls are smaller there will be more space
Maybe when I'm not so tired
Maybe you can step inside
Maybe when I look for things that I can't replace
I can't replace
I can't replace

If you could be my Punk Rock Princess
I would be your Garage Band King
You could tell me why you just don't fit in
And how your gonna be something
If I could be your first real heartache
I would do it all over again
If you could be my Punk Rock Princess
I will be your Heroin

I never thought you'd last
I never dreamed you would
You watched your life go past
You wonder if you should

If you should be my Punk Rock Princess
So I would be your Garage Band King
You could tell me why you just don't fit in
And how your gonna be something
If I could be your first real heartache
I would do it over again
If you could be my Punk Rock Princess
I would be your Heroin

Whoa Ohhhh, you know, you only burn my bridges
Whoa Ohhhh, you know, you just can't let it sink in
You could be my Heroin
You could be my Heroin
