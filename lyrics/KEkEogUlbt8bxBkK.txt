I wonder if there's a life,
Between right and wrong
I wonder which side I'm on,
or if I'm strong enough
I wonder why,
They left me here for dead,
No wonder there,
Are voices in my head

Standin' at the edge of our day that's soon to come

You give a little,
And then you take so much
Caught in the middle
I guess I care too much
I guess I care too much

I wonder what's in your mind,
Behind those eyes I see
It helps me,
To understand just who I need to be
I wonder why,
You left me here for dead
No wonder there,
Are voices in my head

Standin' at the edge, of our day that's soon to come

You give a little,

And then you take so much
Caught in the middle,
I guess I care too much
I guess I care too much

Standin' at the edge, of our day that's soon to come
Standin' at the edge, of our day that's soon to come

You give a little,
And then you take so much
Caught in the middle,
I guess I care too much
I guess I care too much

Standin' at the edge, of our day that's soon to come
Standin' at the edge, of our day that's soon to come

You give a little,
And then you take so much
Caught in the middle,
I guess I care too much

Don't wonder why
I leave here your for dead
No wonder there,
Are voices in,
Voices in my head
Voices in my head (Voices in my head)
