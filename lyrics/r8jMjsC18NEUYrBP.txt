Maureen
It's hard to explain
Never gonna see you again
You'll never meet my new friends
Maureen I miss you
I just can't explain
Never gonna see you again
I wish you could meet my new friends
Walking along the subway listening to
Loving you is easy acapella
You were a souped up car in that rent a go cart town
And I miss you
Maureen
We're as thick as thieves
Maureen Maureen
Remember when my mother said to me
Sade don't you come home too late
Till you're back I stay awake
And Maureen
With the boys you can tell at a glance
You'd say he looks good
Let's hope he can dance
Wicky wacky party to the
Where are we going tonight
And what will you be wearing
M-m-m-m
Shone like a souped up car rent a go cart town
And I miss you Maureen I miss you girl
Ah-ba ba-ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ah-ba ba-ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
You were my best friend
Never gonna see you again Maureen
And you'll never meet my new friends
You really were a pearl in my world Maureen
Maureen
It's hard to explain
You never call 'round to see me again
Never meet my new friends
