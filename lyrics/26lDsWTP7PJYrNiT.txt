It don't matter where you go,
Or who's right, on a sinking ship.
We'll still shatter in the cold,
It came alive, how it drew us in.

I'm found out if all I do is hide between the lines,
An outsider at the door.
I'm unbound, foreign on a path forever mine,
This outsider at the door.

We're confined to be apart,
To take sides in divided cells.
We collide when we depart,
Don't ask me what's the cost,
I don't know myself.

I'm found out if all I do is hide between the lines,
An outsider at the door.
I'm unbound, foreign on a path forever mine,
This outsider at the door.

There's no secret safe,
that I keep from you,
They'll outlast you all.
I'm a coward Not a slave to you,
how can I, Be the silent one?

I'm found out if all I do is hide between the lines,
An outsider at the door.
I'm unbound, foreign on a path forever mine,
This outsider at the door.
