Profaner of the vices, a simple charlatan
Inflaming puerile minds with the guilt of sin
Imaginations fed to children, it has served me well
That the bowels of the earth hides the pits of hell

Idolatrine for the imbeciles
Idolatrine
Idolatrine for the debiles and the simpletons
Disciples of the watch awaits at my command

Lord of silence
Desolated one
Vengeance is his

An existence as a human
Is leaden monotony
With all desires drowned
Impure sanctimony

Idolatrine for the imbeciles
Idolatrine
Idolatrine for the debiles and the simpletons
Disciples of the watch awaits at my command

Suffer little children to come unto me
Suffer little children to come unto me
Suffer little children grant me sovereignty
Suffer little, little, princes and princesses

Idolatrine for the imbeciles
Idolatrine
Idolatrine for the debiles and the simpletons
Disciples of the watch awaits at my command

Suffer little children to come unto me
Suffer little children to come unto me
Suffer little children grant me sovereignty
Suffer little, little, princes and princesses
