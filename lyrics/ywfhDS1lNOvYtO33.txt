I woke up this morning aith this all too familiar feeling
Don't know how long this can go on but it's time to start the show
See this feeling it ain't leaving
getting closer to the edge
Will today be the day that it goes away
or i will i just let go instead

The time is now to take a stand
One last chance to turn it around
The time is now, too late tomorrow
Ain't gonna waste my life no more

There's been times i couldn't see the truth
But now it seems too clear
Answers don't just appear
There really is no greater good or reason to be true
There's only one god to answer to and that god is you

The time is now to take a stand
One last chance to turn it around
The time is now, too late tomorrow
Ain't gonna waste my life no more

When the road is tough and you take a fall
When you're at your lowest stand up tall
It's time to take a stand and fight for your life
your time is now
Dont waste another day
Believe in yourself!

The time is now

The time is now to take a stand
One last chance to turn it around
The time is now, too late tomorrow
Ain't gonna waste my life no more

The time is now to take a stand
One last chance to turn it around
The time is now, too late tomorrow
Ain't gonna waste my life no more
Ain't gonna waste my life no more
Ain't gonna waste my life no more
