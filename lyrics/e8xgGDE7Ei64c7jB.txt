But you can't touch it
And you can't hold it

Non-specific party in a non-specific city
Or anywhere
Any way you feel it's way like
This song or that song or
Act like you feel it but it doesn't heal you
And it doesn't make you smile

And you can't get along without it
No you can't get along without it

Is there a weight that you are trying to unload here
But you just can't get it, you can't get it off now
And when you get it, get it in your blood stream
And you feel whole with it, but you just can't get relief

And there it comes again
And you give in again
And there it comes again, your limitation
And there it comes again
And you give in again
And you give in again, your limitation

And is there something you are trying to express? Yeah
Express it with me, express it with me
And is there something you are trying to express? Yeah

And is there a weight that you are trying to unload here?
But you just can't get it, you can't get it off now
And when you get it, get it in your blood stream
And you just feel whole with, but you just can't get relief

And there it comes again
And I give in again
And there it comes again
My limitation
And there it comes again
And you give in again
And I give in again
Our limitation
