Yeah, you're not the one I used to love
Is she still there inside you?
Something happened to your heart
You should've seen yourself in high school
You're not the one I used to love
What made you wanna hide you?
I wish we never grew apart
You don't know how much I liked you

I still might be the guy for you
Talk to you, never lie to you
When times are getting low for you
Always pick up the phone for you
I don't wanna talk knowledge
I ain't your therapist
You know that I can't be silent
Girl, 'cause I care a bit, oh

You're not the one I used to love
Is she still there inside you?
Something happened to your heart
You should've seen yourself in high school
You're not the one I used to love
What made you wanna hide you?
I wish we never grew apart
You don't know how much I liked you

I still might be the guy for you
Talk to me, I could fight for you
The shawty that I knew was all that
Stand up and get your heart back
Your friends put you on the wrong path
I know you ain't really like that
Used to be my everything
Crazy man, that nothing's changed, yeah

Are you the one I used to love?
Is she still there inside you?
Something happened to your heart
You should've seen yourself in high school
You're not the one I used to love
What made you wanna hide you?
I wish we never grew apart
You don't know how much I liked you
