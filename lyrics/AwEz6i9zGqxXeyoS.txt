When I face my dying day,
I won't have our lamb to give.
If you, if you go and tell me them things are gonna be OK - I don\t wanna hear it now.
If you go and tell me them things... OK

Standing in the way, Standing in the way, I'm still standing...
Standing in the way, standing in the way, I'm standing still
Standing in the way
Standing in the way
I'm still standing
Standing in the way
Standing in the way

Oh
I will forget
I will forget
I know I don't want to
I will forget
I will forget
All the lines of your face
I will forget
I will forget
I know I don't want to
I will forget
I will forget
I know I don't want to

I...
When I face, when I face those fools in court
Oh they won't see me through the door
Why not, why not go show me those things you saw to be true?
Why not? Why not go show me those things you saw?
