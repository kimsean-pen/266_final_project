I picture something is beautiful
It's full of life and it is all blue
I've seen the sunset on the beach, yeah
It makes me feel calm, when I'm calm

I feel good (Good)
And when I feel good I sing (Sing)
And the joy it brings makes me feel good (Good)
And when I feel good I sing (Sing)
And the joy it brings

I see birds fly across the sky, yeah
And everyone's heart flies together
Food is frying and people smiling
Like there is no other way...
To feel good (Good)

And when I feel good I sing (Sing)
And the joy it brings makes me feel good (Good)
And when I feel good I sing (Sing)
And the joy it brings

Come on along, I know you really want to feel our song
We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing
I say

Come on along, I know you really want to feel our song
We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing
Come on along
I know you really want to feel our song

We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing
Come on along, I know you really want to feel our song
We've got some life to bring

We've got some joy in this thing
Can you feel, can you feel
Can you feel the joy that it brings
If you can feel the joy
Then you should let yourself sing
Hey
I love to share my things
Cause it brings me freedom (Freedom), woah
Gotta get yourself to that freedom
Smiling and feeling your heart beat
Freedom! Woah! You deserve your freedom
Dancing and feeling that beauty
Freedom! Woah! Well it's all for you, all for you
All for you, all for you
Sing freedom! Woah! Gotta getcha some of that
Gotta getcha some of that
Gotta getcha some of that freedom!
