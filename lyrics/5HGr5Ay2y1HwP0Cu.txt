Sugar hiccup, hiccup
Sugar hiccup
Makes the earth toss and tumble
Sugar hiccup
Heavens curtsey and bow
Sugar hiccup
Makes it pink, soft, and smooth
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup as she reels
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup as she reels
Sugar hiccup

Sugar hiccup, hiccup
Sugar hiccup
Makes the earth tough and tumble
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup our Cheerios
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup our Cheerios
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup our Cheerios
Sugar hiccup

Sugar hiccup our Cheerios
Sugar hiccup

Heaven's curtsey and bow

Sugar hiccup
Makes a pig soar and swoon
Sugar hiccup

Heaven's curtsey and bow
Makes a pig soar and swoon, now
Sugar hiccup our Cheerios
Sugar hiccup, hiccup now
Sugar hiccup, hiccup
Makes the earth tough and tumble
Sugar hiccup our Cheerios
