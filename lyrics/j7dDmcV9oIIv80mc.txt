Fellow man
Your whole life, like a sandglass
Will always be reversed
And will ever run out again
A long minute will elapse
We'll always be reversed
Until all those conditions
Out of which you were evolved
Return in the wheel
Of the cosmic process
We'll always be reversed

And then you will find every pain and pleasure
Every friend and every enemy
Every hope and every goddamn error
Every blade of grass and every ray of light

Once more
And the whole fabric of things
Which make up your life
Will always be reversed
This ring in which you are but a grain
Will glitter afresh forever
We'll always be reversed

And in every one of these cycles
There will be one hour where
For the first time one man
And then many
Will perceive the mighty thought
Of the eternal recurrence of all things
And for mankind
This is always the hour of noon

And then you will find every pain and pleasure
Every friend and every long-lost lover
Every hope and every goddamn error
Every blade of grass and every ray of light

All over again
Start over again
