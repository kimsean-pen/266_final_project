This river runs so deep
Hold your breath to reach the bottom
Ugly and blind, what will you find?
Hold the sickening silt in your heart and your mind
This river runs so deep
This river runs so deep
This river runs so deep

Close your eyes
Get in touch
With the physical sensations coursing through your body
(Honesty)
Breathe
