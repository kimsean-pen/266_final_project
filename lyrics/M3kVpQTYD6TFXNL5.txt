Yeah we lay down in the sand
you took my clothes off with your hands
I gotta say you look real pretty
all the way from new york city

And the sunlight in your eyes
pins and needles no surprise
and the moon shines in your hair
can you believe it, we're really here.
And it's all handled
you close your eyes and count to ten
don't swallow any seaweed
or if you do you're starting again

You either didn't or you did
talking bout... talking ...
talking bout how you wanna live
we call it metamorphosis
yeah this is metamorphosis

And the sunlight in your eyes
pins and needles no surprise
and the moon shines in your hair.
can you believe it, we're really here
And it's all handled
oh, close your eyes and count to ten
don't swallow any seaweed
or if you do you're starting again
