There were mourners on the street
Of every shape and size
The motorcade came down from Redondo
Assassins on the corner tried to throw you a line
You dirty-mouth comic Rodolfo
And that's Lenny
Valentino reside
Valentino reside
Valentino reside

And the Pope renounced you as the real one
Lazarus decided to rise
The Twentieth Century had only begun
Ladies averted their eyes
And that's Lenny
Valentino reside
Valentino reside
Valentino reside

John Judnich in the bathroom reading the law
Kitty in the hall with your mother
The girls are sick and tired of your blah blah blah
Some beat-kid said there's no other
And that's Lenny
Valentino reside
Valentino reside
Valentino reside
