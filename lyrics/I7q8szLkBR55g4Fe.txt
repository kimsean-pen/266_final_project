"Will the soundtrack kindly produce a sound?"
"Go on, don't be nervous. Go ahead, any sound."
"Well, that isn't quite what I had in mind..."

Hey

Oh my god, there's nobody who can set me right
I've been sent to torch the palace down in broad daylight
I wanna know who you told 'til they're all laying on the floor
frozen to the core
I wanna know who you told till it's nobody anymore
Nobody anymore

Oh my god, I'm a giant with an appettite
Pushin' people to the ground and running round the halls at night
I wanna know who you told 'til they're all laying on the floor
frozen to the core
I wanna know who you told till it's nobody anymore
Nobody anymore

I've been creeping round I saw a little thing I didn't like
you tried to hide
I've been creeping round I saw a little thing I didn't like
you tried to hide from me
I wanna know who you told there's nobody any-any-any...

Nobody anymore

Nobody anymore
