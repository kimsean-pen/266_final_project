A-one, two, a-one, two, three, four!

This here's the story about a house husband
Who, you know, just has to get out of the house
He's been lookin' at, you know
The kids for days and days
He's been washin' the dishes
And screwin' around and watching Sesame Street
'Til he's goin' crazy!

Woke up this morning
Blues around my head
No need to ask the reason why
Went to the kitchen and lit a cigarette
Blew my worries to the sky

I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out, yeah

If it don't feel right
You don't have to do it
Just leave a message on the phone
And tell them to screw it
After all is said and done
You can't go pleasin' everyone
So screw it

Ooh, I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out, baby
I'm stepping out

Baby's sleeping
The cats have all been blessed
Ain't nothing doing on TV
Summer repeats
Put on my space suit
I got to look my best
I'm going out to do the city

I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out, babe
I'm stepping out
Boogie

One more

I'm stepping out
Hold it down
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
Gotta gotta gotta, gotta get out
I'm stepping out, babe
Just awhile
Ain't been out for days
Gotta do it tonight
Gimme a break, gimme a break, gotta get out
Gotta get out
Just for a while
Just for the night
I'll be in before one... or two... or three... goodbye!
