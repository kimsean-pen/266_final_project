Embracing is an atmosphere
American interior
When loneliness is so austere
American interior
If only you could join me here
American Interior

Your visions carry me
Your visions carry me
To a new world
American Interior
Your chills will carry me
Your chills will carry me
To a new world
American Interior
Trouble and fatalities
To freeze in the exterior
And searching for a [?]
And friendship [?]
American Interior
American Interior

Your visions carry me
Your visions carry me
To a new world
American Interior
Your dreams will carry me
Your dreams will carry me
To a new world
American Interior

American Interior
American Interior
Oh
American Interior

I knew it from the start
That one day we'd depart
To a new world
American Interior
I knew it from the start
That one day we'd depart
For a new world
American Interior

Your visions carry me
Your visions carry me
To a new world
American Interior
Your dreams will carry me
Your dreams will carry me
To a new world
American Interior

Oh
American Interior
