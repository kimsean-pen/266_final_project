yeah i fell in love
like all good dreamers do
finally in anger
i gave it all to you
i never shouted it
like we do in school
and knee-jerk negativity
just never got me through
and ma she said so carefully
you don't get a vote
this is not a five and ten
this is not a joke she said
it's only you and only i
bang bang
bye bye
now i got a love
to lose myself inside
i don't need to find a face
that i can hide behind
i never shouted it
like we do in school
bleed your negativity
just never got me through
but ma she said so carefully
you don't get a vote
this is not a five and ten
this is not a joke
she said
it's only you and only i
bang bang
bye bye
lose yourself lose yourself
lose yourself lose yourself
