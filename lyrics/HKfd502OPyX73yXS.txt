I came back to face what's growing in my head.
Please get away from me.
Take advantage of what I feel, yes you do.
One day you'll beg for me.

So I'm saying nothing.
Each day taking that much more.
As I'm screaming all my pain, you will be there... counting.

You just see me as something you throw around.
You aren't there for me.
Beating down to the ground, yes it always seems.
You take more from me... more from me

So I'm saying nothing.
Each day taking that much more.
As I'm screaming all my pain, you will be there... counting.

It's funny how it gets started
They get their money-grubbing fingers on you
They give you money, and the girls, and the fame
I only do it for the fun, that's my game
