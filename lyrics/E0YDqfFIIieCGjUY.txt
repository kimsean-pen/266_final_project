Thank you for coming home
Sorry that the chairs are all worn
I left them here I could have sworn

These are my salad days
Slowly being eaten away
Just another play for today

Oh, but I'm proud of you, but I'm proud of you
Nothing left to make me feel small
Luck has left me standing so tall

Gold
(Gold)
Always believe in your soul
You've got the power to know
You're indestructible
Always believe in, 'cause you are
Gold
(Gold)
Glad that you're bound to return
There's something I could have learned
You're indestructible
Always believe in

After the rush has gone
I hope you find a little more time
Remember we were partners in crime

It's only two years ago
The man with the suit and the face
You knew that he was there on the case

Now he's in love with you, he's in love with you
But love is like a high prison wall
And you could leave me standing so tall

Gold
(Gold)
Always believe in your soul
You've got the power to know
You're indestructible
Always believe in, 'cause you are
Gold
(Gold)
I'm glad that you're bound to return
There's something I could have learned
You're indestructible
Always believe in

(Hah)
(Hah-hah)
(Hah)
(Hah-hah)
(Hah)
(Hah-hah)
(Hah)

But love is like a high prison wall
And you could leave me standing so tall

Always believe in your - soul
You've got the power to know
You're indestructible

I'm glad that you're bound to return
Something I could have learned
You're indestructible
