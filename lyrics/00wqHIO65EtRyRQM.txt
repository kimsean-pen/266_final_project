We can fight our desires
Ooooh but when we start making fires
We get ever so hot
Ooooh whether we like it or not
They say we can love who we trust
Ooooh but what is love without lust?
Two hearts with accurate devotions
Ooooh but what are feelings without emotions?

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh I'm hoping you'll understand
and not let go of my hand

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh I'm hoping you'll understand
and not let go of my hand

I hang my hopes out on the line
Ooooh will they be ready for you in time?
If you leave them out too long
Ooooh they'll be withered by the sun
Full stops and exclamation marks
Ooooh my words stumble before I start
Oooooooh
How far can you send emotions?
Ooooh can this bridge cross the ocean?

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh I'm hoping you'll understand
and not let go of my hand

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh I'm hoping you'll understand
and not let go of my hand

Let's go to war to make peace
Let's be cold to create heat
I hope in darkness we can see
And you're not blinded by the light from me

Oooooh Oooooh Oooooh Oooooh Ooooooooooh

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh I'm hoping you'll understand
and not let go of my hand
