Ray Collins (lead vocals, harmonica, tambourine, finger cymbals, bobby pin, tweezers)
Jimmy Carl Black (drums)
Roy Estrada (bass, guitarron, boy soprano)
Elliot Ingber (lead guitar, rhythm guitar)

Yeah!
Got no place to go
I'm tired of walking up and down the street all by myself
No love left for me to give
I try and try but no-one wants me the way I am

Why should I pretend I like
To roam from door to door
Maybe I'll just kill myself
I just don't care no more

Because I'm not satisfied
Everything I tried
I don't like the way
Life has been abusing me

Yeah! Yeah!

Who would care if I was gone?
I never met no-one who'd care if I was dead and gone
Who needs me to care for them?
Nobody needs me, why should I just hang around?

Why should I just sit and watch
While the others smile?
I just wish that someone cared
If I was happy for a while

Because I'm not satisfied
Everything I tried
I don't like the way
Life has been abusing me

Yeah!
