Friday night, August the 14th
Old lady luck smiled down on me
My income tax return came through
I put old 47
I know that I probably should not
Matter of fact I probably could not
Buy all the good times meant for me

But then, Friday night, gonna be a memory
You know that the whole wide world will remember me, yeah
You find a little pussycat to come and see
Then I close my eyes and I'm free?
Yeah!
I know that I probably should not
Matter of fact I probably could not
Buy all the good times meant for me
Yeah!
Yeah

Friday night, August the 14th
Friday night, August the 14th
Friday night, August the 14th
Friday night, August the 14th

Well I know that I probably should not
Matter of fact I probably could not
Buy all the good times meant for me
Yeah!

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah ah hey!
