Everybody wants to go home now
Everybody is checking their phones now
Everybody knows that it's late now
Everybody's putting their coats on

I call bullshit the night is young
My drug of choice and I sure ain't done
I call bullshit the night is young
My drugs of choice and I sure ain't done

It's okay to be alive
Let's live like we are out of time
Who cares if we are wrong or right
Let's live like we are out of time

Everybody's making excuses
Everybody looks pretty useless
Everybody wants to go home soon
Everybody's putting their coats on

I call bullshit the night is young
My drug of choice and I sure ain't done
I call bullshit the night is young
My drugs of choice and I sure ain't done

It's okay to be alive
Let's live like we are out of time
Who cares if we are wrong or right
Let's live like we are out of time

I call bullshit the night is young (It's okay to be alive)
My drug of choice and I sure ain't done
I call bullshit the night is young
My drugs of choice and I sure ain't done
