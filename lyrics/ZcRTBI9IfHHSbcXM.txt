Who are these spirits whom you see before you?
They didn't worship God in fitting ways.
And for no other evil we're lost and punished.
We have no hope and yet we live in longing.

Tell me master, tell me, more, I want to know
cause I myself for the one.
Did any ever go on his own from this place to blessedness?

Who are these souls just kept separate from the rest?
Their name which echoes up within your life.
Because each of these spirits shares with me
the name called out by the lone voice.

Silence here is just as seemly as our speech was here.
Encircled seven times by towering walls.
The people here had eyes that were grave and slow.
We move along and toward the light.
