Eyes will drift to the sky in time
while arms keep holding tight
there's a party in full force
still the guests can't help but watch the door

expressing your uncertainties
through years of anniversaries
then five years down the line
you'll say: she was never my type

lovers are strangers
there's nothing to discuss
hearts will be faithful
while the truth is told to someone else

when you look off
tell me who you really love

fall comes by surprise
looking into strange eyes

like school kids who are not friends
in the streets they are connected
huddling in the dark
the only number you call
magic moments are not lost
they'll outlive all your doubts

lovers are strangers
there's nothing to discuss
hearts will be faithful
while the truth is told to someone else

when you look off
tell me who you really love

when you look off
tell me who you really love

when you look off
tell me who you really love

when you look off
tell me who you really love

when you look off
tell me who you really love
