The day will come through
It will only take some time
Turning into a press on the matter
Look for the reasons behind it all

It will only take some time
The day will come through
And I might do you some good
And I might do you some good

Down, lift off from the ground
Each second to save
Everything has its point today

And what you say it might come true
I wouldn't complain
Unless you want me to
Point out where you live

And notice who you friends are
You are better off
This will only take some time
To understand

Down, lift off the ground
Each second to save
Everything has its point today

So many questions how you live
The bests reasons I can give
I've never been here before
Everything has its point today

Lost it all again
To start over
Turn around and then, you see things even
You see everything

It will only take some time
Down, lift off the ground
Each second to save
Everything has its point today

So many questions how you live
The bests reasons I can give
I've never been here before
Lost it all again
