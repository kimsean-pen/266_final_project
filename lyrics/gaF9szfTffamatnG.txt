might looks so grand from a distance that you need to touch
it gives a vision of the simple but it isn't much

i won't be fooled by it's touch or emotional supply
the scent of the fair and heavy allure will dry
the cold and the bare grasped so delicate by ones' eye
is why we can't ally and elope to wry

almost forgotten the way we used to live for play
to be accepted i must blend into conventions way
and sing in universal ways
