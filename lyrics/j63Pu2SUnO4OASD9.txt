I was gripped with a bitter fear
Worried the one thing that I loved
Back when I was just a kid
Might now never be enough
That the body I was in
Might belong to someone else
Someone kinder, someone surer
Someone innocent, young and beautiful

Someone purer.

I was scratching at my skin
Hoping the changes would begin
But what layed beneath was blood
Well, of course! What the hell was I thinking of?
Won't you take me down to the creek
To wash away our sins and sleep?
I feel so tired, as though I might not wake at all on the other side
That's no way to go.

Oh, my dear one
Bathe me in your glow
Cut out my lonely heart
And bury it in the snow
Nothing really means nothing
It's the saddest thing I know
So deliver me from sin
And give me Rock'n'Roll
Ooh, ah, oh, oh, oh, ah
Ooh, ah, oh, oh, oh, ah.
Give me Rock'n'Roll
Ooh, ah, oh, oh, oh, ah
Ooh, ah, oh, oh, oh, ah

And in the morning there'll be hope
And in the morning there'll be light
And if I sleep I'll dream up a system
A solution to fend off perils of the night
Come on in I'll be born again
Born again as someone else
Soneone kinder, someone surer
Someone beautiful, someone purer
And when I am you'll know
When I am you'll know

Oh, Mighty one
The devil knows my name
Will salvation come
To wash away my pain?
For I was once a kid
With a pure and innocent soul
So deliver me from sin
And give me Rock'n'Roll
Ooh, ah, oh, oh, oh, ah
Ooh, ah, oh, oh, oh, ah
Ooh, ah, oh, oh, oh, ah
Ooh, ah, oh, oh, oh, ah
Give me Rock'n'Roll
Give me Rock'n'Roll
And a pure and innocent soul
And a pure and innocent soul
Give me Rock'n'Roll
Give me Rock'n'Roll
And a pure and innocent soul
And a pure and innocent soul
And a pure and innocent soul
