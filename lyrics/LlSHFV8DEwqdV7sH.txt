The scientist purported that there ain't no purpose

And the theologian told me that it's all been designed
And I'm trying to maintain objectivity
The world won't illuminate what really matters
And I'm an imperfect moral meaning extractor
processing the complexity
Born of the Earth (Are we blind?)
We weren't given a choice (There's no way)
What about free will? (What we have)
Do we have a voice? (Is shattered faith)
See them run in place (Here and now)
In the human rat race (No reward)
So much dead weight (No debate) to our disgrace (Shattered faith)
Life begins when you accept your fate
Paralysis from forces raging out of control until
My confidence and will are at an all-time low
Just directionless wandering
Eternal life, eternal truth, eternal secrets
Isolated hopes and hypotheses just
Leave me feeling so hungry
Born of the Earth (Are we blind?)
We weren't given a choice (There's no way)
What about free will? (What we have)
Do we have a voice? (Is shattered faith)
See them run in place (Here and now)
In the human rat race (No reward)
So much dead weight (No debate) to our disgrace (Shattered faith)
Life begins when you accept your fate
Right or wrong
The main criterion is what you do and not what you say
The roads you take, the friends you make and those you throw away
The method is a simple synthesis of the past and present state
You never lose if the path you choose is one you can easily navigate
I had a dream, light and carefree
But now there's doubt and gravity
But I won't run in place (Are we blind?)
In the human rat race (There's no way)
I can set the pace (What we have)
And accept my fate (Is shattered faith)
Shattered faith (Here and now)
Shattered faith (No reward)
The part of me (No debate) I can't erase (Shattered faith)
