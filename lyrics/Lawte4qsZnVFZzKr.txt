I'm a realist and an optimist
But I swear to you, I'm not getting over this

Walking tall in a small town
Full of yourself when you're feeling down
And that's all that matters to you
Can't pretend anymore
Talk is cheap, I said that before
But you can still taste it
And that's one more reason why you're never gonna make it

I've had enough of all the talk on how you're saving me
Talk like you're self assured but all you are is history
Speak slow, I want you to know that
I'm a realist and an optimist
But I swear to you, I'm not getting over this

No, no, I'm not getting over this

You've got the right be all that you wanna be
And that's extraordinary
Is it worth the risk? (Can you handle it?)
I can't pretend anymore
You don't wanna leave, you said that before
Oh, but you can still taste it
And that's one more reason why you're never gonna make it

I've had enough of all the talk on how you're saving me
Talk like you're self assured but all you are is history
Speak slow, I want you to know that
I'm a realist and an optimist
But I swear to you, I'm not getting over this

Fall back in line, it's too much to expose
It's your design and that's the way it goes
I think I know my limits, and how to make good decisions
It hits home, so just go

I've had enough of all the talk on how you're saving me
Talk like you're self assured but all you are is history
Speak slow, I want you to know that
I'm a realist and an optimist
And that's one more reason why you're not getting over this
I'm a realist and an optimist
But I swear to you, I'm not getting over this

No, no, I'm not getting over this
No, no, I'm not getting over this
