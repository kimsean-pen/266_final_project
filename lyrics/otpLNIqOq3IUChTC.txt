I beat my machine
It's a part of me
It's inside of me
I'm stuck in this dream
It's changing me
I am becoming
The me that you know, he had some second thoughts
He's covered with scabs
He is broken and sore
The me that you know
He doesn't come around much
That part of me...
Isn't here anymore

All pain disappears
It's the nature of...
Of my circuitry
Drowns out all I hear
No escape from this
My new consciousness
The me that you know
He used to have feelings
But the blood has stopped pumping and he is left to decay
The me that you know is now made up of wires
And even when i'm right with you i'm so far away

I can try to get away
But I've strapped myself in
I can try to scratch away
The sound in my ears
I can see it killing away
All of my bad parts
I don't want to listen
But it's all too clear

Hiding
Backwards inside of me
I feel... so unafraid
Annie, hold a little tighter
I might just slip away

It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
