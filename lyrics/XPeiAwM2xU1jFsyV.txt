It was the best that you could be for me
I think we were lucky just to stay alive
Even when you had only fire to breathe
I know you were only trying to make it right

Change everything I've ever known
Try once again to let you go

If you could go back now would you say it differently
If there was no one there would you open up for me
If this was the last time that we would ever speak
Could we forgive somehow could we let it rest in peace

Stories are lost somewhere behind your eyes
You are a dying breed you stand alone
I couldn't get through no matter how I tried
You tore me apart but still I love you so

Change everything I've ever known
Try once again to let you go

If you could go back now would you say it differently
If there was no one there would you open up for me
If this was the last time that we would ever speak
Could we forgive somehow could we let it rest in peace

If you could go back now would you say it differently
If there was no one there would you open up for me
If this was the last time that we would ever speak
Could we forgive somehow could we let it rest in peace

If you could go back now would you say it differently
If there was no one there would you open up for me
If this was the last time that we would ever speak
Could we forgive somehow could we let it rest in peace
