So the story begins
City dweller, successful fella
Thought to himself "Oops, I've got a lot of money
Caught in a rat race, terminally
I'm a professional cynic but my heart's not in it
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit
Caught up in the century's anxiety"
Yes, it preys on him
He's getting thin
Try the simple life
He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
Watching afternoon repeats and the food he eats, in the country
He takes all manner of pills and piles up analyst bills, in the country
Oh, it's like an animal farm
Lots of rural charm in the country

He's got morning glory and life's a different story
Everything's going Jackanory
Touched with his own mortality
He's reading Balzac and knocking back Prozac
It's a helping hand that makes you feel wonderfully bland
Close your eyes, child
Oh, it's the century's remedy
For the faint at heart
A new start
Try the simple life
He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
He's got a fog in his chest so he needs a lot of rest, in the country
He doesn't drink, smoke, laugh, takes herbal baths, in the country
But you'll come to no harm on the animal farm, in the country
In the country
In the country
In the country

Blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why
Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why
Oh, he lives in a house, a very big house in the country
Watching afternoon repeats and the food he eats, in the country
He takes all manner of pills and piles up analyst bills, in the country
Oh, it's like an animal farm
Lots of rural charm in the country
He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
He's got a fog in his chest so he needs a lot of rest, in the country
He doesn't drink, smoke, laugh, takes herbal baths, in the country
But you'll come to no harm on the animal farm, in the country
I wanna be
I wanna be
