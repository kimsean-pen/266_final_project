Stagger Lee met Billy
And they got down to gambling
Stagger Lee throwed seven
Billy said that he throwed eight

So Billy said, "Hey Stagger
I'm gonna make my big attack
I'm gonna have to leave my knife
In your back"

Why do you try to cheat, and trample people under your feet?
Don't you know it is wrong to cheat a trying man?
Don't you know it is wrong to cheat the trying man?
So you better stop, it is the wrong 'em boyo

You lie, steal, cheat and deceit in such a small, small game
Don't you know it is wrong to cheat a trying man?
Don't you know it is wrong to cheat a trying man?
You better stop, it is the wrong 'em boyo

Billy boy has been shot and Stagger Lee's come out on top
Don't you know it is wrong to cheat a trying man?
Don't you know it is wrong to cheat Stagger, man?
You better stop, it is the wrong 'em boyo

So you must start all over again, all over again
Don't you know it is wrong, play it Billy, play
Don't you know it is wrong, play it Billy, play
And you will find it is the right 'em boyo

But if you must lie and deceit and trample people under your feet
Don't you know it is wrong to cheat a trying man?
Don't you know it is wrong to cheat a trying man?
You better stop, it is the wrong 'em boyo

It is the wrong 'em boyo
