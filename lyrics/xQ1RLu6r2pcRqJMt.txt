Don't hold your breath

You can't touch me now, there's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
I was under your spell for such a long time
Couldn't break the chains
You played with my heart

Tore me apart with all your lies and games
It took all the strength I had
But I crawled up on my feet again
Now you're trying to lure me back
But no, those days are gone, my friend
I loved you so much

That I thought someday that you could change
But all you brought me was a heart full of pain
You can't touch me now, there's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
Don't hold your breath
I was worried about you

But you never cared about me none
You took my money and I know that you,
You could kill someone
I gave you everything but nothing was ever enough

You are always jealous over such crazy stuff
You can't touch me now, there's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
Don't hold your breath
Move on, don't look back
I jumped off a train, running off the tracks

Your day's gone, face the facts
A bad movie ends and the screen fades to black
What you did to me
Boy, I cannot forget

If you think I'm coming back
You can't touch me now

You can't touch me now, there's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
You can't touch me now, there's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
