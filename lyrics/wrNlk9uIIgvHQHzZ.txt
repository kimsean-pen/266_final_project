Sometimes the river flows but nothing breathes
A train arrives but never leaves, it's a shame
Oh, life like love that's walked out of the door
Of being rich or being poor, such a shame

But it's then, then that faith arrives
To make your feelings alive
And that's why, you should keep on aiming high
Just seek yourself and you will shine

You've got to search for the hero inside yourself
Search for the secrets you hide
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life

In this life, long and hard though it may seem
Live it as you'd live a dream, aim so high
Just keep the flame of truth burning bright
The missing treasure you must find

Because you and only you alone
Can build a bridge across the stream
Weave your spell in life's rich tapestry
Your passport to a feeling supreme

You've got to search for the hero inside yourself
Search for the secrets you hide
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life

You've got to search, inside yourself
Deep, deep down inside yourself, yeah
You've got to search, inside yourself

You've got to search for the hero inside yourself
Search for the secrets you hide
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life

Search for the hero inside yourself
Search for the secrets you hide
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life

You've got to search inside yourself
You've got to search
