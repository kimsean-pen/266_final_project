I heard a word from 'on high'
Glare like a light in the sky
It said
"Quit blowing each other up"
A voicing so crystalline clear so
Something's unclean in your ear
When only blood fills your cup

Hello
I'm trying to focus
But my eyes deceive me
Focus
I'm witnessing history
Repeating

It fell like a tear from my eye
Flying machine so up high
Well, There goes the neighborhood
A scene set to singe innocence
Upheave, unhinge and pit against
Like every made for TV movie should

Hello
I'm trying to focus
But my eyes deceive me
Focus
I'm witnessing history
Repeating

Focus, focus, focus
Focus (I can see now)
Focus (I can see now)
Focus (I can see now)

We are, we know, we see, we think for you
The who, the what, the when, the where, the why
We build your hill, we build you too, we see you

Hello
I'm trying to focus
But my eyes deceive me
Focus
I'm witnessing history
Repeating
