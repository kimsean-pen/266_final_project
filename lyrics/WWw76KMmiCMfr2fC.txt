Well, it sure feels good to come in here
And just pull up a seat
A frosty mug of a cool one
Helps to beat the heat
These old dog days of summer
Lord, I'll be glad when they're gone
It's too hot to fish and too hot for golf
And too cold at home

Well, that baseball game on TV
Takes me back to when I was a kid
We proudly wore those uniforms
Just like the Dodgers did
Yeah, we won a few and and we lost a few
And for me it still goes on
It's too hot to fish and too hot for golf
And too cold at home

Well, I only planned on one or two
I might stay for three
If that good-lookin' thing in the corner
Keeps smilin' back at me
It's so easy not to care
'Bout what's right or what's wrong
It's too hot to fish and too hot for golf
And too cold at home

Well, I only planned on one or two
I might stay for three
If that good-lookin' thing in the corner
Keeps smilin' back at me
It's so easy not to care
'Bout what's right or what's wrong
It's too hot to fish and too hot for golf
And too cold at home

It's too hot to fish and too hot for golf
And too cold at home
