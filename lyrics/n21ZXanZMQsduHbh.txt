Don't stop to worry, there's nothing worse
When you're falling off the surface of the earth
I start to wonder, how much you care
When you're slowly disappearing up the stairs

Just turn around
I can't believe that you would go without a sound
Am I just waiting, waiting for the girl
Who was there when I was drifting through the world
Just to get some, get some love

Every day, every day, every day
I want you in my life
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait,
I'll never give up, never give up hope

Every day, every day, every day
I want to feel alive
And I know, and I know, and I know
I'll never give up, never give up hope

I keep on dreaming, but I'm wide awake
Just counting down the hours to the day

You can't explain it, you don't read the signs, but
Your life's already tangled up in mine

Just turn around
I can't believe that you would go without a sound
Am I just waiting, waiting for the girl
Who was there when I was drifting through the world
Just to get some, get some love

I don't run this way, I don't play this game, I don't fall apart, when I
Feel the spark
