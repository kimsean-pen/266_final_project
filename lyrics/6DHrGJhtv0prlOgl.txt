Could you hear it?
All the birds singing while we talked there?
And my heart being all Fred Astaire
In an eternal musical?

Or was I crazy?
Did I imagine we were perfect?
Did I start alone the first act
Of our romantic two-men show?

Can you save me?
Do I deserve perhaps a maybe
To the "will you ever call me baby"
Eternal question in my mind?

I sure hope so
Don't feel compeled to anything, though
Just because think watchinhg you go
Is the saddest thing that I can find

I'll survive it
Being an extra in your story
I'm fine with it, so don't be sorry
I can be Lady 22

If that's it, then
Just give my part and keep me silent
Give me a tiny little line and
I will change it to "I love you"
