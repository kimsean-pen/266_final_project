I got a secret, I'm telling everyone
Don't wanna keep it, I wanna play it dumb
I made a promise I think I'm ready to break
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

It's just a question, there's nothing wrong or right
But your intentions could keep you up all night

You play with fire, you need a way to escape
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

And when the lights go out, go out
We're just beginning

And all around, our eyes are looking down
You spin the bottle round
And round and round and round
na na na na na

Truth!
Last kiss on the tip of your lips
Really his, talk talk

Where's your heart beat, beating?
Dare!
Time's up, are you ready or not?

Tick tick tock, so don't stop
When you get that feeling now-ow-ow
Talk talk, 'cause your heart'd be beating
Now-ow it's just a game

I feel uneasy, I feel a little scared
I see the danger in being unprepared

I try to hide it before I make a mistake
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

So when the truth is out, is out

We're just beginning
And not a sound, our eyes are staring down
We spin the bottle round
And round and round and round
na na na na na
Truth!

Last kiss on the tip of your lips
Really his, talk takk
Where's your heart beat, beating?
Dare!

Time's up, are you ready or not?
Tick tick tock, so don't stop
When you get that feeling now-ow-ow

Talk talk, 'cause your heart'd be beating
Now-ow it's just a game
I'm ready, so ready
So take me on (So take me on)
Keep steady, don't drag this on
And on and on and on
Truth!
Last kiss on the tip of your lips
Really his, talk takk
Where's your heart beat, beating?
Dare!
Time's up, are you ready or not?
Tick tick tock, So don't stop
When you get that feeling
Truth!
Last kiss on the tip of your lips
Really his, talk talk
Where's your heart beat, beating?
Dare!
Time's up, are you ready or not?
Tick tick tock, so don't stop
When you get that feeling now-ow
Talk talk, 'cause your heart'd be beat beating
Now-ow it's just a game
