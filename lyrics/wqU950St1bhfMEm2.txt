Every time I call you on the phone
You're with your new girl
What's the deal with that?
What about me and what I want?
Can't take it, I need your affection

You don't show me no love anymore
I've had enough dancing on my own
You don't show me no love anymore, love anymore

Rude love
Rude love

Reminiscing of the days but the memories fade
You're a stranger, can hardly recognize your face
So track everything we had just didn't mean a thing
Didn't mean a thing, didn't mean a thing

'Cause you don't show me no love anymore
I've really had enough dancing on my own
You don't show me no love anymore, love anymore

Rude love
Rude love
Love
Rude love
(You don't show me)
(You don't show me)
Rude love
(You don't show me)
(You don't show me)

Tell me how I'm supposed to know
When you keep blowing hot and cold
I just don't get enough
It's just to rude this love
And I feel that it's gonna grow

(This rude love)
You don't show me no love anymore
You know, all you'd show me is rude love, rude love
(You don't show me)
You don't show me no love anymore
You know, all you'd show me is rude love, rude love
(You don't show me)
You don't show me no love anymore
You know, all you'd show me is rude love, rude love
(You don't show me)
You don't show me no love anymore
You know, all you'd show me is rude love

You don't show me
You don't show me
You don't show me
Rude love
You don't show me
You don't show me
You don't show me
Rude love
You don't show me
Rude love
You don't show me
Rude love
You don't show me
Rude love
You don't show me
Rude love
