I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
But I know that it's too soon
I could run away, but I wanna stay
So I've gotta play it cool
If only I had been the one to be your first
But knowing I was second only makes me hurt
And every time you say her name it makes it worse
So maybe we should start
We can't help it, If we want this
I'll be selfish, I'll be self-destructive
We can't help it, If we want this
I'll be selfish, I'll be self-destructive
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
But I know that it's too soon
I could run away, but I wanna stay
So I'm gonna play it cool
If we never try, If we never try
Then I guess we'll never know
Lying to ourselves, promise not to tell
It's out of our control
If only I had been the one to be your first
But knowing I was second only makes me hurt
And every time you say her name it makes it worse
So maybe we should start
We can't help it, if we want this
I'll be selfish, I'll be self-destructive
We can't help it, if we want this
I'll be selfish, I'll be self-destructive
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
But I know that it's too soon
I could run away, but I wanna stay
So I've gotta play it cool
If only I had been the one to be your first
But knowing I was second only makes me hurt
And every time you say her name it makes it worse
So maybe we should start
We can't help it, if we want this
I'll be selfish, I'll be self-destructive
We can't help it, if we want this
I'll be selfish, I'll be self-destructive
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
But I know that it's too soon
I could run away, but I wanna stay
So I've gotta play it cool
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
But I know that it's too soon
I could run away, but I wanna stay
So I've gotta play it cool
