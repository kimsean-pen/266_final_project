East london's not a bomb site
It is a treasure chest
We use our penguin costumes
more than our evening dress
She said I should come over
though the musics not my type
Don't you know i'd chop a limb off
Just to have a good time

shut up and move with me move with me or, or get out of my face
I didn't queue for a hour to leave straight away
shut up and stay with me, stay with me or let go of my hand
the lasers fill our minds with empty plans
I never knew I was a techno fan

This is not a weird weekend, its an angry worm hole
I'm talking like a city boy, drinking with a northern soul
She said I should come over
Though there's carnage at times
It still seems I'd chop a limb off
Before I put up a fight
So shut up and move with me move with me or, or get out of my face
I didn't queue for a hour to leave straight away

Shut up and stay with me, stay with me or let go of my hand
The lasers fill our minds with empty plans
I never knew i was a techno
We are the 1980's, we are the Detroit Lights and i never wanna, i never wanna see
this stop

I'm in debt to you
But don't feed me plant food
Just shut up and move with me move with me or, or get out of my face
I didn't spend 20 sheets to not cut a shape
Shut up and stay with me, stay with me or let go of my hand
The lasers fill our minds with empty plans
I never knew I was a techno fan.
