My life is so boring
It's really got me snoring
and I'm wearing out the flooring in a cheap motel
But I don't have to work
And I might be sinning
But I never gonna have to hear the rings of school bells

Well, don't you remember
You told me in december
That a boy is not a man until he makes a stand
Well, I'm not a genius
But maybe you'll remember this
I never said I ever wanted to be a man

I get nervous when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around

I get nervous when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around

I get nervous when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around

I get nervous when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around

Hey

My mom is so caring
She really got me staring
At all the crazy little things she does for sure
And I can't seem to think of
Another kind of love that a boy could ever get from anyone but her

I get nervous when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around

I get nervous when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around

I get nervous when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around

I get nervous when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around
Oh, when she comes around
