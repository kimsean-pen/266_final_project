I refuse to think your abandonment
Has become the common place
You needed to be set free
You needed to be rid of me
Running around in circles
I am just trying to place the blame
I thought we said forever
I thought you felt the same

Stuck in a frame, you remain my conscience
We were broken
Before we bent

I can feel it now you're there but you're not
I'm picking up what we've lost
Lay me in the ground
Just throw it away
There's nothing more you can say

I'd like to think that the love that we had
Was different than the rest
Cause I never felt that way
I never would have second guessed
But things are different now
Being selfless let me down
Never again will I let you in

I'm not as strong as you think
I'm tired, I'm weak
Like an anchor tied to my feet
You left me to sink

Stuck in a frame, you remain my conscience
We were broken
Before we bent

I can feel it now you're there but you're not
I'm picking up what we've lost
Lay me in the ground
Just throw it away
There's nothing more you can say
I can feel it now
(No turning back this time, I'll leave it all behind)
Lay me in the ground (I can feel it now)

I did everything I could to rise above
I gave you all I had
But it was never enough
It was never enough
Set free
