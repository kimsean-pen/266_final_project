Little black angel as years roll by
I want you to fly with your wings held high
I want you to live by the justice code
I want you to burn down freedom's road
My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel

Oh lie away, oh lie away sleeping
Lie away safe in my arms
Your father, you future protects you
And locks you safe from all harm

Little black angel as years roll by
I want you to fly with your wings held high
I want you to live by the justice code
I want you to burn down freedom's road

My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel
