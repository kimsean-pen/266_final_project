It was a time when we walked by the docks
I told you, "I need you all of my life"
And watching the tugs rolling by together
Do you remember?
Do you remember the lights on the shore?
How they reflected the rain on the road?
I believe that you love me alone
It was real
Do you remember?
Now and then I see your face
I've been wanting a lovin' embrace
I've been looking for love, but it gets me nowhere
Oh, yeah, yeah

Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love)
Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love)
I can't get enough of
Of you
It was a time we were all full of hope
Saw the future burning bright
As we watched the moon rollin' out to sea
Do you remember?
But those days are erased from my mind
Yeah, I've left all those old days behind
But still I remember your face forever, forever

Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love)
Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love)
I can't get enough of
Of you

Ooo-oo-ooh
All of your love, all of your love
All of your love, all of your love
Get enough, get enough, get enough, girl
Get enough, get enough, get enough, girl
I can't get enough
Enough of you
