In the morning by the sea
As the fog clears from the sand
I have no money in my hand
I have no home, I have no land

But it doesn't trouble me
As I lay beside the fire
I am easy to inspire
There is little I require

I wasn't yours and you weren't mine
Though I've wished from time to time
We had found a common ground
Your voice was such a welcome sound

How the emptiness would fill
With the waves and with your song
People find where they belong
Or keep on

Through the never-ending maze
Where the way is seldom clear
There is no map or compass near
I drive a ship I cannot steer

Through the bleak and early morn
Where a stronger will is sworn
Where the moments move so slow
And seem to never let you go

When my hands are old and ache
And my memory flickers dim
And my bones don't hold my skin
There's no place I haven't been

I recall the days were few
That is all that I can do
Feel the carvings in the tree
That gives shade for you and me
