No one dared to
Speak of the terrible danger
The hideous ancient warnings
Forged in the void of night

He has risen up
Out of the blackness
Chaos
The last of the prophets
Sinister
A sickening monstrous sight

Through the stifling heat
Underneath the pale green moon

I burned with a thirst
To seek things not yet seen

Climbing endless stairs
Leading to the choking room

Eager to explore
His most shocking mysteries

Drifting beyond all time
Out of a churning sky
Drawn to the beckoning light
Of the dark eternal night

Black forces
Rage in the vortex
Fighting
Waves of destruction
Swallowing
The echo of the universe

I am the last
Born of the blood of the pharaohs
The ultimate god of a rotting creation
Sent to unleash this curse

Restless crowds draw near
Nameless hooded forms appear

Amidst fallen ruins
Grotesque creatures battle

Shadowed on a screen
Yellow evil faces leer

Vacant monuments
Corpses of dead worlds left behind

Drifting beyond all time
Out of a churning sky
Drawn to the beckoning light
Of the dark eternal night
Trapped in a hellish dream
Spinning past worlds unseen
And frightfully vanishing
Into the dark eternal night
Drifting beyond all time
Out of a churning sky
Drawn to the beckoning light
Of the dark eternal night
Trapped in a hellish dream
Spinning past worlds unseen
And frightfully vanishing
Into the dark eternal night
