You used to talk to me like I was the only one around
You used to lean on me
The only other choice was falling down
You used to walk with me like
We had no where we needed to go nice and slow
To no place in particular

We used to have this figured out
We used to breathe without a doubt
When nights were clear, you were the first star that I'd see
We used to have this under control
We never thought we used to know
At least, there's you, and at least, there's me
Can we get this back?
Can we get this back?
To how it used to be

I used to reach for you, and I got lost along the way
I used to listen
You always have the just right thing to say
I used to follow you
Never really cared where we would go fast or slow
To anywhere at all

We used to have this figured out
We used to breathe without a doubt
When nights were clear, you were the first star that I'd see
We used to have this under control
We never thought we used to know
At least, there's you, and at least, there's me
Can we get this back?
Can we get this back?
To how it used to be

I look around me
And I want you to be there
'Cause I miss the things that we shared
But look around you
It's empty and you're sad
'Cause you miss the love that we had.

You used to talk to me like I was the only one around
The only one around

We used to have this figured out
We used to breathe without a doubt
When nights were clear, you were the first star that I'd see
We used to have this under control
We never thought we used to know
At least, there's you, and at least, there's me
Can we get this back?
Can we get this back?
To how it used to be
To how it used to be
To how it used to be
To how it used to be
