Everything's fine but you look weird
Lucy I trust you to be kind
Everything's fine but I feel weird
You can't always change the way that you're good
Don't be so nice
Don't be so nice
Don't be so nice
Don't be so

Don't play with me
Our girl can't be seen the way that we see
I'm fine, are you okay?
You promised to tell me how you were
Don't be so nice
Don't be so nice
Don't be so nice
Don't be so
