I was dreaming of the past
And my heart was beating fast
I began to loose control
I began to loose control
I didn't mean to hurt you
And I'm sorry I made you cry
I didnt want to hurt you
No I didnt
I'm just a jealous guy

I was feeling insecure
You might not want me anymore
I was shivering inside
I was shivering inside
I didn't mean to hurt you
And I'm sorry I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you
No I didn't
I'm just a jealous guy
I didn't mean to hurt you
And I'm sorry I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
I'm just a jealous guy
I'm just a jealous guy
Yes I am
I'm just a jealous guy
