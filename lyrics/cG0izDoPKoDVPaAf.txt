In a crazy world
Anything can happen if you will it to
I'm just a hazy girl
Blurring all the edges, only seeing blue

It's a wild hope
A wild hope
A wild hope
Everything will be alright

Lost inside
A painting of a city on a hotel wall
Days goes by
Wasting golden hours in the fall

It's a wild hope
A wild hope
A wild hope
Everything will be alright

I catch a glimpse of our reflection
Besides you, I see myself
We are the season's new collection
We look like everybody else

Walk alone
Through the crowded streets into the fading gray
Here and gone
Like a decoration for the holiday

It's a wild hope
A wild hope
A wild hope
Everything will be alright

Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
