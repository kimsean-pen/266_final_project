I was a highwayman
along the coach roads I did ride
sword and pistol by my side
many a young maid lost her baubbles to my trade
many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade
the bastards hung me in the spring of '25
but I am still alive

I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
the way of the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner 'round the horn of mexico
I went aloft to furl the mainsail so little blow
and when the yards broke off they said that i got killed
but I am living still

I was a dam builder
across the river deep and wide
where steel and water did collide
a place called boulder on the wild colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
they buried me in that grey tomb that knows no sound
but I am still around
I'll always be around and around and around and around and around and around...

I fly a star ship
across the universe divide
and when i reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
I may become a highwayman again
or i may simply be a single drop of rain
but I will remain
and I'll be back again and again and again...
