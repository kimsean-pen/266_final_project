1, 2, 3, 4
Every time I'm in the room, I can feel you
It gets so hard to fight the feelings inside
I don't want to be the one that took you
But we're running out of time to make things right

Let's forget we got another, feel each other
It could be like
'Cause you know what I like
Let's make it happen, taste the passion
That we hold back every time
'Cause you know what I like

Breathe, let go
Straight into the night
Breathe slow, let go
Bring me back to life

I can't watch you love her
So please make up your mind
To blow my mind
Acting like we're nothing when they come into sight
But you know it ain't right

Let's forget we got another, feel each other
It could be like
'Cause you know what I like
Let's make it happen, taste the passion
That we hold back every time
'Cause you know what I like

Breathe, let go
Straight into the night
Breathe slow, let go
Bring me back to life

Breathe slow, never let go, oh
Let's make love tonight
Bring me back to life
Breathe slow, never let go, oh
Let's make love tonight
Bring me back to life

Breathe, let go
Straight into the night
Breathe slow, let go
Bring me back to life

Breathe slow, never let go, oh
Let's make love tonight
Bring me back to life
Breathe slow, never let go, oh
Let's make love tonight
Bring me back to life

Breathe
