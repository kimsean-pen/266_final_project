I used to be a rolling stone you know
If the cause was right
I'd leave
To find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beatin' for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say, the more my work gets done

'Cause I live and breathe
This Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born
I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee high to a man
Yeah
Gave me peace of mind my Daddy never had

Oh Philadelphia freedom
Shine on me
I love you
Shine a light
Through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light won't you shine a light?
Philadelphia freedom
I love you

Yes I do!

If you choose to you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city
(Some people choose the city)
Some others
Choose the good old family home
(Some others choose the good old family home)
I like living easy without family ties
('Cause it's easy)
'Til the whippoorwill of freedom
Zapped me
Right between the eyes

'Cause I live and breathe
This Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born
I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee high to a man
Mmmm, mmmm
Gave me peace of mind my Daddy never had

Oh, Philadelphia freedom
Shine on me
I love you
Shine a light
Through the eyes of the ones left behind

Shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light won't you shine a light?
Philadelphia freedom
I love you

Yes I do!

Oh Philadelphia freedom
Shine on me
I love you
Shine a light
Through the eyes of the ones left behind
Mmm, mmm
Shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light won't you shine a light?
Philadelphia freedom
I love you
You know I love you
Yeah!
You know I love you
Yes I do!
(Philadelphia Freedom)
I love you
(Yes I do)
(Philadelphia freedom)
You know that I love you

(Philadelphia freedom)
Oh
Don't you know that I love you?

(Philadelphia freedom)

(Philadelphia freedom)
Don't you know that I love you?
