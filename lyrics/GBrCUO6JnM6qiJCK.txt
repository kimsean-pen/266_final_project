What the fuck is going on?
We've waited far too long
It's time to see our self-built misery
A chance grabbed by the veil
Self-produced prophecy
A chance for all
Time to avert the fall

If you feel so terrorized
You should not bow for them
Do you realize?

Whats left for me?
You are a witness
Drowning in the sickness
If there are sparks in these eyes
By night, in darkness
We arise!

What the heck have we become?
Thin shells through martyrdom
It's you and me - in full blown agony
For now we bite the nail
Ready to rise and fall
Reflect the storm
From ashes we are born

Children of fire
Your time has yet begun
You shall fly higher
You waited far too long
