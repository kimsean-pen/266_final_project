I can't cut you down
Your heart is as cold as the ground
Stood there like a tombstone
Here lies someone you used to, you used to love
You could rely on
Now you can't even lie on
And every time you do, panic will swallow you
And you'll fail, in a fiery crash
Black smoke and volcanic ash

I don't wanna live in the shadow of the mountain no more
I'm sick of being hidden in the darkness
That all these vampires adore
I feel like I'm breaking under the heaviest weight
I don't belong here but here is where I wait

And you'll fail, in a fiery crash
Black smoke and volcanic ash
That he keeps on spitting, sets fire to the living
And he burns off your skin and your soul
And you love him but you want him to know

I don't wanna live in the shadow of the mountain no more
I'm sick of being hidden in the darkness
That all these vampires adore
I feel like I'm breaking under the heaviest weight
I don't belong here but here is where I wait

Ooh...

I don't wanna live in the shadow of the mountain no more
I'm sick of being hidden in the darkness
That all these vampires adore
I feel like I'm breaking under the heaviest weight
I don't belong here but here is where I wait
