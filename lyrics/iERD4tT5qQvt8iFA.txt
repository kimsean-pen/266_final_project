Can I do this service level shit?
You know I kiss deeper
Deeper than your favorite, mmm
Yeah, don't be out here screaming: gang, gang, gang
If you ain't gang, gang
Looking silly out here baby
Why you twisting up your fingers, mmm
You want to solidify your Spot now
'Cause I'm hot now
You don't get the picture
Can't tell that it's cropped now
Got that shit on lockdown
I'm as sick as they come, wasn't the one
Now I'm at front, roll up the blunt
Listening to drum, ain't no telling what I'm finna be on
Beyond any kickstand I don't want to lead on

It's been a while since I've last seen you
Might want you but I find peace knowing I don't need ya
It's been a while since I've last seen you
Might want you but I find peace knowing I don't need ya

You know he don't write like this
Ain't nice like this, can't type like this
Girl you know I kiss deeper, mmm
You know I could see the shine in you're yes
I remember you was blind with your eyes
Funny how your vision finally got cleaned up, mmm
So you want to solidify a spot now, not now
Silly, silly, silly, you look at me as a prop now
Ever since Never Know she wanna know if I really got the drop now
Did you talk this much back in the day?
Well maybe you changed, maybe these gains
Ain't really gains, maybe you serious
Maybe I'm tripping, am I delirious?
'Cause it's been a while since I've last seen you, you know
A lot is different, I'm finally living

It's been a while since I've last seen you
Might want you but I find peace knowing I don't need ya
It's been a while since I've last seen you
Might want you but I find peace knowing I don't need ya
