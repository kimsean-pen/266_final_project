Degeneration tears your blackened eyes
The final descent for the last in life
No joy in our tired lives - the torment builds inside
The sun sets forever on a world of lies

Non-divine
World of lies
Non-divine
Release me

Demonic vultures feed on your mind
Disarmed of all your pride you die
No life in our alien eyes - the blind lead the blind
The sun sets forever on the non-divine

World of lies
World of lies
Non-divine
Release me

Final psychotic eclipse
Painted in the colours of war
Final psychotic eclipse
A world drenched in blood

Degeneration tears your blackened eyes
The final descent for the last in life
No joy in our tired lives - the torment builds inside
The sun sets forever on a world of lies

World of lies
World of lies
Non-divine
Release me

"And it's his illusions about what
constitutes the real world which are
inhibiting him...
His reality, his reason, his society
...these are what must be destroyed"
-Luke Rhinehart, "The Dice Man"

Final psychotic eclipse
Painted in the colours of war
Final psychotic eclipse
A world drenched in the blood of the innocent
