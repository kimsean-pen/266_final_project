At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream that a could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
She smiled, she smiled
Oh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine
At last
