I can't feel my toes or my fingertips
My chest is pounding so fast I can't keep up with it
I'm losing it, fuck, and I just want to quit
And I'm clenching my face and and I'm touching my dick

I need a fix ana fix ana I'm sIck of this
Showing people my tricks and my tics
Ana judging me
Judging my fucking sex ANA x ANA x
And I'm faking just to stay in my body
I get nervous, I can't fucking stand it

Well if thats what they're giving me
The pills are my necessity now
You won't fix my attitude
'Cause ana does it better than you
(Ana does it better)

Ana you save my soul
Can you let me have my heart fall in it

Yea-hah
(I need you)

Ok I'm sick
Not the kind of sick that lands you in the doctor
Not the kind that makes you weak and then heals you stronger
It's the kind of sick that turns your legs into spaghetti
It's the kind of sick that makes your blood burn and your bones heavy
The kind of sick that makes an atheist pray for Jesus
The kind of sickness that turns your power into weakness

I'm sick of being sick for this whole fucking place to witness
And I'm living a sick life that most people call privilege
And they're kinda right but I'm still sicker than I can cope with

Ana you save my soul
Can you let me have my heart fall in it
I suffer for a living
There has to be a limit
You know i love you so
But that's what I've been given

Ana (want you save my soul)
Ana (want you to make me slow down)
Ana (want you save my soul)
Ana (want you to make me slow down)

Showtime
Got a lump in my throat
I forgot how to breathe
Only know how to choke

And all these people are waiting
To see the kid with the rage
But I'm afraid he might collapse before he gets to the stage
I need x ANA x
Help me bury my thoughts
And all the pressure I've suffered
To be someone that I'm not

I'm shaking a lot
(Hey don't fuck up tonight it's your only shot)

Ready or ready or ready or not
It's a party

You know I love you so
Ana you saved my soul
Ana (let's pump it up, let's go)
Ana (don't make me lose control)
You know I love you so
Ana you save my soul
Ana (let's pump it up, let's go)
Ana (don't make me lose control)

(Ana) okay the song is over now
(Ana) but I'm not ready to go
(ana) this is the shit that happens when I stay awake for days at home (Ana)

Hey! Wanna see what happens when I mix Xanax,
Blow and a MacBook pro

Don't make me lose control
Ana (white pills coming up let's go)
Ana (too late to save my soul)
Ana (chew it up chew it up let's go)
Ana (coming up coming up let's go)

Ana you save my soul (my soul)
Suffer for a living, has to be a limit
You know i love you so (you so)
My anxiety traps me like a prison

Thats what they're giving me
The drugs are a necessity
(I can't live without you)
You won't fix my attitude
Ana does it better

Ana you make me slow down

Joey's gonna hate this

Ana does it better
Ana does it better
Ana does it better

Don't make me lose control
Ana
