Drain Gang
It's actually quite fun, come to think about it
Toxic, can't feel my lungs, I can't think about it
It's only real for you, that's the thing about it
(It's only real for you, for you, for you)
It's only love for you and I'll die about it
I know you know we are on, don't be shy about it
I choose my way of life, I can't cry about it
I chose to be this way
Ahh, ahh, D-9, don't play with me
Ahh, ahh, I'm fine, got the knife on me
Ahh, ahh, I'm failed, got the cape on me
I chose to be this way
Ahh, ahh, the night, don't go dark on me
I swim too far, got the sharks on me
I'm gonna spill my blood on a star, homie
Crystals on me, ok
