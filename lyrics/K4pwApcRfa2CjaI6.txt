Oo-wah, oo-wah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Oo-wah, oo-wah, ah

My old desk
Does an arabesque
In the mornin' when I first arrive
It's a pleasure to see
It's waitin' there for me
To keep my hopes alive
Such a comfort to know
It's got no place to go
It's always there
It's the one thing I've got
A huge success
My good old desk

My old desk
Never needs a rest
And I've never once heard it cry
I've never seen it tease
It's always there to please me
From nine to five
Such a comfort to know
It's dependable and slow
But it's always there
It's the one friend I've got
A giant of all times
My good old desk

Oo-wah, oo-wah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Oo-wah, oo-wah, ah

My old desk
Isn't picturesque
But it's happy as a desk could be
We never say a word
But it's perfectly alright with me
For when my hearts on the floor
I just open the drawer
Of my favorite guest
And what do I see?
But a picture of me
Workin' at my good old desk

Oo-wah, oo-wah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Oo-wah, oo-wah, ah
