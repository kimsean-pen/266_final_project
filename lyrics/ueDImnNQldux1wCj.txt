I, I was born a loser
I, I was born a loser

I remember the times when we used to
Sit in the park holding hands together
I never should have gone away and left you like I did
I thought you'd take me back, but I was just a little
Bit late

I, I was born a loser
I, I was born a loser

My lonely days and my lonely nights, girl
On the outside looking in, dreaming of holding you
Tight
Well I guess I've had my day, you let me go my way

It's me who has to pay, "the loser" they call me

I, I was born a loser
I, I was born a loser

I, I was born a loser
I, I was born a loser

My lonely days and my lonely nights, girl
On the outside looking in, dreaming of holding you
Tight
Well I guess I've had my day, you let me go my way
It's me who has to pay, "the loser" they call me

I, I was born a loser
I, I was born a loser
