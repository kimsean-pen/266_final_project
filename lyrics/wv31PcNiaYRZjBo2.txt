closed doors brings open minds
(and i don't want to see you)

see you smile, inside
(and i don't want to know you)

faces, and i've fallen
(and i don't want to hear you)

wonder why i'm here now
in asylum, don't you see?
in asylum don't you see

doors close and feelings flow
(and i don't want to know you)

through my mind i feel his...
(and i don't want to hear you)

pictures and i've fallen
(and i don't wanna know you)

wonder why im here now
(i promise to be near you)

curse your soul, i don't wanna know you
and i, curse your soul i don't wanna know you...
