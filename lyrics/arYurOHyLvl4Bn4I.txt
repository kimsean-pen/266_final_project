Boom, boom, boom, Sminoshima
Sminova Scotia, beam on 'em
Aw they hate it when you smile nah
They lactose tolerant, I cheese on 'em
Smino compadre, speak up
Me no speak no english
Country country my lingo
Smell the smoke, that shit linger
Smino di grigio these hoes dutty wine
Bumper cars in the Beamer
Bunk beds, ain't no space
Fuck you thought? I don't team up
Stick with my familia
We go back like Girbauds and wife beaters
Back in the space when they tried to delete us
We blew G's and stay G'd up

And I'm just sitting here
Thinkin' 'bout
All of the
Money that
I could be
Getting right now
Wasting my time
What you doin'
I told you I
Only got
Time for these
Benjis I count
I only come through for that guarantee
That right on time, that exactly what I need
I need that guarantee

Smi D Pablo keep a freak-a-leek
Greedy hoes they want a piece of me
Mama told me about these phony frolickers
My apologies I can't let y'all drain me
Smi-know better than to trust gimmicks
Smino, more like Smi-Yeah
Young Denzel train all day
Run shit here, ya'll just live here
Smino-ly Bible I live by
Cross my heart, hope to die nigga if I'm lying
Only bands make me march
I beat the odds like a drum line
And I ain't never in a rush
I ain't no Russian, I'm a blkswn
Being timeless how I pass time
Scheming, plotting 'til it's attack time

And I'm just sitting here
Thinkin' 'bout
All of the
Money that
I could be
Getting right now
Wasting my time
What you doin'
I told you I
Only got
Time for these
Benjis I count
I only come through for that guarantee
That right on time, that exactly what I need
I need that guarantee
Sitting here
Thinkin' 'bout
All of the
Money that
I could be
Getting right now
Wasting my time
What you doin'
I told you I
Only got
Time for these
Benjis I count
I only come through for that guarantee
That right on time, that exactly what I need
I need that guarantee

Sweanita!
I need that guarantee
Guarantee, guarantee
Yeah, yeah that guarantee
I need that guarantee
Guarantee, guarantee
That shit be turnin' me, oh
I need that guarantee
Guarantee, guarantee
Yeah, yeah that guarantee
I need that guarantee
