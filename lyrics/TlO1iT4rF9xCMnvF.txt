is there anyway i can dive into your heart?
ain't there anyplace, i can dive into your heart?
on a pebble beach, or maybe a moon of mars
don't push me away, i can dive into your heart

tell me i can stay, here in your heartdon't go away
know that i am coming, coming into your heartdon't dance away
tell me i can stay, here in your hearti hope i'm not too late
tell you, i am coming, coming into your heartplease don't go away

inside out, come home looking like your head fell off
downtown, seeing what your eyes know now
one more left to go on
just one chance now, you come home looking like a lover girl
downtown, free of all your highs oh now
one more left to go on

tell me i can stay, here in your heart
know that i am coming, coming into your heart
tell me i can stay, here in your heart
tell you i am coming, coming into your heart
