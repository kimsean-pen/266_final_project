Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the greatest of them all?
My man Muhammad, Boy Jesus too
Whose Messiah be good for you?

'Cause I came I saw
I conquered all
All ya'll, all ya'll, all ya'll

People look towards Mecca's way
Sistine Chapel, people pray
It don't matter what you do
Holy World War will come for you
