It's in your head, they're telling you it's in your head,
It's a figment of your imagination.
It isn't there, they're telling you it isn't there,
You're a victim of your infatuation.
What do I think that it is I see? I keep asking myself.
Nothing like this has ever happened to me ...

There's a perfect lover running through my head.
There's a perfect lover; I can see her in my head.
Perfect lover. Lover.

They keep telling you -- they keep telling you, it's just a fascination.
Why don't they listen -- no one listens to what I am sayin'!
And everyone tells you she just isn't there, that it just couldn't be.
If only they knew how real she is to me ...

There's a perfect lover running through my head.
There's a perfect lover; I can see her in my head.
There's a perfect lover running through my head.

There's a perfect lover; I can see her in my head.

Sometimes I hear the cry, (I hear it crying out)
Your voice from deep inside. (inside, inside, inside ...)
They're stealing you from me ...
Ever be ...

I'm not looking through the eyes of a desperate stranger.
What I envision is so real, I don't want to change her.
And sometimes I feel like she's standing right there,
Like I could reach out and touch her.
Only I know how real she is to me ...

There's a perfect lover running through my head.
There's a perfect lover; I can see you in my head.
There's a perfect lover running through my head.
Perfect lover. Lover.
