The sun goes down the night rolls in
You can feel it starting all over again
The moon comes up and the music calls
You're getting tired of staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room and down on the street
You can feel the crowds in the midnight heat
The traffic roars the sirens scream
Look at the faces it's just like a dream
Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been
'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night

Living in a river of darkness beneath the neon light
You were born in the city

Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves it's in your blood
You're a man of the street
When you said goodbye you were on the run
Tryin' to get away from the things you'd done
Now you're back again and you're feeling strange
So much has happened but nothing has changed

Still don't know where you're going
Your still just a face in the crowd
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness beneath the neon light
You were born in the city

Concrete under your feet
It's in your blood it's in your moves

For a man of the streets

You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it
You can hear it hey...
You're getting near it hey...
You're wanna make it
Oh-oh

'Cause you can take it
Oh-oh-oh
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong...
You belong...
Oh... oh
