I never thought
I'd change my opinion again
But you moved me in a way

That I've never known
But you moved me in a way

That I've never known

But straight away
You just moved into position again

You abused me in a way
That I've never known

You abused me in a way
That I've never known
So break me, shake me

Hate me, take me over
When the madness stops
Then you will be alone

Just break me, shake me

Hate me, take me over
When the madness stops

Then you will be alone no no

No no no
Wow ohh
Ohh
Wow wo

So you're the kind
Who deals with the games in the mind
Well you confuse me in a way
That I've never known
You confuse me in a way
That I've never known
So break me, shake me
Hate me, take me over
When the madness stops
Then you will be alone
So won't you break me, shake me
Hate me, take me over
When the madness stops
Then you will be alone no no
No no
She said, "I can help you
But what do you say?"
Because it's not free baby
You'll have to pay
You just keep me contemplatin'
That your soul is slowly fading
Yea no no no no no
God, don't you know
Well I live with a ton of regret
'Cause I used to move you in a way
That you've never known
But then I accused you in a way
That you've never known
But you've hurt me in a way
That I've never known
Break me, shake me
Hate me, take me over
When the madness stops
Then you will be alone
So won't you break me, shake me
Hate me, take me over
When the madness stops
Then you will be alone
(Listen, baby)
Break me, shake me
Hate me, take me over
When the madness stops
(You will be, you will be alone)
Then you will be alone
Break me, shake me, hate me
Take me, make me
Fake me, break me, shake me
Hate me, take me
Break me
