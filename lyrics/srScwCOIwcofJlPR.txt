The devil, he's at my door
And I know what he came here for
The kind of fun that I adore
I let him enter to make some more

Fire, it burned my skin
But I still want to play with it
Like a shark fin in the swim
I cut myself and jump on in

Baby boy, baby brother
We're losing you to the gutter

A woman, she's at my door
And too bad it's my best friend's girl
She's a cooking up, a civil war
I'm dumb enough to storm the shores, yeah

There's a red light up ahead
I drive my car into it
I'm a little kid, big death wish
I bite the lips, the lips that kiss

Baby boy, baby brother
We're losing you to the gutter
Baby boy, baby brother
We're losing you, is it forever?

Baby boy, baby brother
We're losing you to the gutter
Baby boy, baby brother
We're losing you, is it forever?

The devil, he's at my door
And I know what he came here for
The kind of fun that I adore
I let him enter to make some more
