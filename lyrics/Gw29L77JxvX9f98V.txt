Sometimes it feels like nothing's right (Constant dead-ends)
Sometimes it feels like waling blind (In a damn maze)
I can't think straight (I can't stop screaming)
I can't turn back (I've come too far in)
When all you see is all you get don't look away

Deep inside us all a scar that's never healing
Deep inside us all the answer is always hidden
But will we ever know?
Why we're always searching for a reason
Just to run away, run away

They say there's nothing time can't heal (Can we wait long?)
I'll say there's nothing time can't take (We die everyday)
Just live today (Don't stop to think straight)
This is the day (We overcome the pain)
When all you see is all you get, don't look away

Deep inside us all a scar that's never healing
Deep inside us all the answer is always hidden
But will we ever know?
Why we're always searching for a reason
Just to run away, run away

All the things I found in this deadly maze
All the things I lost in the same old days

All the things I found in this deadly maze
All the things I lost in the same old days
Should I try to make some revolution?
Or beg someone to give us absolution?

Deep inside us all a scar that's never healing
Deep inside us all the answer is always hidden
But will we ever know?
Why we're always searching for a reason
Just to run away
Run

Deep inside us all a scar that's never healing
Deep inside us all the answer is always hidden
But will we ever know?
Why we're always searching for a reason
Just to run away, run away, run away

When all you see is all you get, don't look away
