You've got an appetite for wanting love
Oh, when death comes you should be
Heaven's obsession, heaven's obsession
I'm stood still, I can barely breathe
You're such a mess but you're always beautiful to me
Run your fingers across my mouth
I'm not prepared to stay here without you

You'll always be my favourite obsession
I'm so sorry for confessing
And I don't wanna wait 'cause you know I feel the same
My obsession

And I swear that I'll never stop loving you
And I'll die by your side if you want me to
Your eyes, so frail, burdened with sadness
Such a pure heart lost in the madness
I'll stay awake to make sure that you never break

You'll always be my favourite obsession
I'm so sorry for confessing
And I don't wanna wait 'cause you know I feel the same
My obsession

You'll always be my favourite obsession
I'm so sorry for confessing
And I don't wanna wait 'cause you know I feel the same
My obsession
My obsession
My obsession
I feel the same
I feel the same
And I swear that I'll never stop loving you
And I'll die by your side if you want me to
