Doing everything by halves
Got a real flare with excuses
Meeting someone at the bar
Where loose ends still have uses

It's complicated
(This time I think it could be)
Triangulated
(It could be just what we need)
So what d'you say we give it up and walk away
We're overrated anyway

We're kissing without kissing
Got it down to a fine art
Love's supposed to keep you young and frisky
But we grew up and wide apart
Not now, not ever, no, it's never a good time
How will the good times ever roll on
Comparing photos that are now not there
Just wondering (wondering)
Where it all went wrong

It's complicated
(This time I think it could be)
Triangulated
(It could be just what we need)
So what d'you say we give it up and walk away
Nothing to salvage anyway

Want to, oh, Need to, oh, Try to, oh
None of the above
Want to, oh, Need to, oh, Try to, oh
None of the above
Want to, oh, Need to, oh, Try to, oh
None of the above
Want to, oh, Need to, oh

It's complicated

It's complicated
