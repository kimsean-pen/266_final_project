It doesn't matter that you think you can win
It doesn't matter that you've hopes and you've dreams
Invincibility don't strike like before
You burned your bridges yet you come back for more

Why, oh why is this killing me?
Could it be that this thing isn't over?
Why, oh why does this never cease to be?
Could it be that this love isn't over?

It doesn't matter that you think I will lose
It doesn't matter that you think I'm your fool
Invisibility won't rupture my soul
A little quality will swallow you whole

What a scene, what a score, what a show
Look at you on the floor fallen over
What a scene, what a score, what a show
This could it be the end, this could be the mother of them all
