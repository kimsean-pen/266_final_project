I could not breath against the wall
The clash of light against the floor
They held me up against the wall
Too young to be ignored

Standing by a building
Leaks out information
Passive death of freedom gets me
Where's my security
Behind my back it goes
Early morning's coming
The risk that I am taking
Recall a song that I heard as a child
No more false immunity
Inside the blistering cold

My youth unknown to me
I'm walking by a wire
What's left from me to breathe
Cold smell of fire
One day I will be free
I was born to be no one
My youth unknown to me
I walked behind the sun

I could not breath against the wall
The clash of light against the floor
They held me up against the wall
Too young to be ignored

Standing by a building
Leaks out information
Passive death of freedom gets me
Where's my security
Behind my back it goes
Emptiness within me
Exit signs within me
The one you're looking for is not here
Had no security
He will not come back

My youth unknown to me
I'm walking by a wire
What's left from me to breathe
Cold smell of fire
One day I will be free
I was born to be no one
My youth unknown to me
I walked behind the sun
