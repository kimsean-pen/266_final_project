At least it's all about you
I think the blondes are done with fun
At least it's all about you
I think the blondes are done, we're all too cool for fun

I go blonde when I'm sad
Blew motivation I had
To make my still-beating something
Not hurt that bad
Haven't been home in some months
I haven't loved myself
Just watching friends online
Look like they need some help

I never wanted to be thinking this loud
I never asked about the when, why or how
I wanted privacy, routine and everything between
While they're just finding me out
I never wanted to be thinking this loud

At least it's all about you
I think the blondes are done with fun
At least it's all about you
I think the blondes are done
We're all too cool for fun
No plastic or paper can take her or make her
Shake from the fact she's my world devastator
You...
I think the blondes are done
We're all too cool for fun

I go blue when I've had
A break at home to breathe
I used to crave a getaway
Now I don't wanna leave
I was stuck at home for some months
I didn't love myself
Before we sold out shows
Before I needed help

I never wanted to be thinking this loud
I never asked about the when, why or how
I wanted privacy, routine and everything between
While they're just finding me out
I never wanted to be thinking this loud

At least it's all about you
I think the blondes are done with fun
At least it's all about you
I think the blondes are done
We're all too cool for fun
No plastic or paper can take her or make her
Shake from the fact she's my world devastator
You...
I think the blondes are done
We're all too cool for fun

I'm falling from my couch across these states for you
I feel trapped in contracts, I'm depressed, tied in gift wrap
I'm seconds from bottles when these seconds feel awful
But now I don't for you (you)

At least it's all about you
I think the blondes are done
(We're all too cool for fun)
At least it's all about you
I think the blondes are done with fun
At least it's all about you
I think the blondes are done
We're all too cool for fun
No plastic or paper can take her or make her
Shake from the fact she's my world devastator
You...
I think the blondes are done
We're all too cool for fun
