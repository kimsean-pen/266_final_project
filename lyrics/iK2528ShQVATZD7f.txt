What good is sitting alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a Cabaret, old chum
Come to the Cabaret

Put down the knitting
The book and the broom
It's time for a holiday
Life is a Cabaret, old chum
Come to the Cabaret

Come taste the wine
Come hear the band
Come blow a horn
Start celebrating
Right this way
Your table's waiting

What good's permitting
Some prophet of doom
To wipe every smile away
Life is a Cabaret, old chum
Come to the Cabaret!

I used to have a girlfriend
Known as Elsie
With whom I shared
Four sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you'd call
A blushing flower...
As a matter of fact
She rented by the hour

The day she died the neighbors
Came to snicker
"Well, that's what comes
From too much pills and liquor"
But when I saw her laid out like a Queen
She was the happiest... Corpse...
I'd ever seen

I think of Elsie to this very day
I remember how she'd turn to me and say
"What good is sitting all alone in you room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a Cabaret, old chum
Come to the Cabaret"

And as for me
I made my mind up back in Chelsea
When I go, I'm going like Elsie
Start by admitting
From cradle to tomb
It isn't that long a stay
Life is a Cabaret, old chum
Only a Cabaret, old chum
And I love a Cabaret
