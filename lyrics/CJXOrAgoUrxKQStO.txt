I see a lair, I see a lair, I see a lair
Whoa-oh-oh
I fight for air, I fight for air, I fight for air
Whoa-oh-oh
I see a lair, I see a lair, I see a lair
Whoa-oh-oh
You keep me there, you keep me there, you keep me there
Oh

It's getting late now, my head goes ka-boom
Escape from this room and I'll wait for a wave
To come wash away, keep me out of this place
I fight for air, don't keep me there
Don't keep me there, I fight for air

I see a maze, I see a maze, I see a maze
Whoa-oh-oh
I break the cage, I break the cage, I break the cage
Whoa-oh-oh
I'm in a maze, I'm in a maze, I'm in a maze
Whoa-oh-oh
I break the cage, I break the cage, I break the cage
Oh

I see a lair, I see a lair, I see a lair
Whoa-oh-oh
I fight for air, I fight for air, I fight for air
Whoa-oh-oh
I see a lair, I see a lair, I see a lair
Whoa-oh-oh
I see you there, I see you there, I see you there
Oh
