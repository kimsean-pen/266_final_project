All my lazy teenage boasts are now high precision ghosts
And they're coming 'round the track to haunt me
When she looks at me and laughs I remind her of the facts
I'm the king of rock 'n' roll completely

Up from suede shoes to my baby blues

Hot dog, jumping frog, Albuquerque
Hot dog, jumping frog, Albuquerque

Dream helps you forget you ain't never danced a step
You were never fleet of foot, hippy
All the pathos you can keep for the children in the street
For the vision I have had is sweeping

New broom, this room, sweep it clean

Hot dog, jumping frog, Albuquerque
Hot dog, jumping frog, Albuquerque

High kickin' dandy
Fine figure fine cut a fine figure fine, oh, yeah
Long legged candy
Fine figure fine cut a fine figure fine, oh, yeah

Now my rhythm ain't so hot, but it's the only friend I've got
I'm the king of rock 'n' roll completely
All the pretty birds have flown, now I'm dancing on my own
I'm the king of rock 'n' roll completely

Up from, suede shoes to my baby blues

Hot dog, jumping frog, Albuquerque
Hot dog, jumping frog, Albuquerque

High kickin' dandy
Fine figure fine cut a fine figure fine, oh, yeah
Long legged candy
Fine figure fine cut a fine figure fine, oh, yeah, yeah

Hot dog, jumping frog, Albuquerque
Hot dog, jumping frog, Albuquerque
Hot dog, jumping frog, Albuquerque
Hot dog, jumping frog, Albuquerque

Hot dog, jumping frog, Albuquerque
Hot dog, jumping frog, Albuquerque
