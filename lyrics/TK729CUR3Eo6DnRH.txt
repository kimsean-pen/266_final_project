Three times three
First cut first
Pierce the skin
It binds us
Spit cum blood
Liquid wax
No one loves you
As much as us

By all in me that's holy
By all in me that's blessed
I made to you a promise
That this is forever and ever
Amen

Three times three
Lose all fear
Let the flames
Dry those tears
It takes hurt
To be pure
Now you're one of
You're one of us

No means no
No means no
No means no
No means no
No means no

No
Yes...
No
Yes...
No
Yes...
