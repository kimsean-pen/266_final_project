New girl in the city, Post up lookin' real pretty
Came with a crew, but I would do anything to get her with me
She was 5"5, with brown eyes (brown eyes), long hair down to her spine

I'm not the jealous type but I might be tonight
I can treat you right baby
You got me thinkin' though we can take it slow
Girl you need to know

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind, up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool, up in here, up in here

Shakin' like you was a video mixer

I'm not the jealous type but I might be tonight
I can treat you right baby
You got me thinkin' though we can take it slow
