Here comes another fall from grace
I'm always falling on my face.
This attitude that I embrace
With a love I'm trying to replace.
Try to kill this song
'Cause the melody's all wrong.
And there's a feaver, comin' on.

It's hard to reconcile
What I've become.
With the wounded ch-i-ld
Hiding deep ins-i-yide.

Breathe underwater
I'm comin' up for air!
I wanna see another dawn
(Comin' up for air!)
Sick of the slaughter
(I'm comin' up for air!)
'Cause I've floating here too long.

Take my ego for a ride
'Cause there's nobody by my side.
It's getting hard to justify.
And it won't be long 'til I collide.
My weakness laid bare
As people stop and stare.
But It's the last time, I swear.

It's hard to reconcile
What I've become.
With the wounded ch-i-ld
Hiding deep ins-i-yide.

Breathe underwater
(I'm comin' up for air!)
I wanna see another dawn
(Comin' up for air!)
Sick of the slaughter
(I'm comin' up for air!)
'Cause I've floating here too long.

Start breathing...
Start breathing...
Start breathing...
Start breath-ing!

Breathe underwater
(I'm comin' up for air!)
I wanna see another dawn
(Comin' up for air!)
Sick of the slaughter
(I'm comin' up for air!)
'Cause I've floating here too long.
I'm coming, I'm coming...
I'm coming, ' coming...
Comin' up for air...
Comin' up for air!
