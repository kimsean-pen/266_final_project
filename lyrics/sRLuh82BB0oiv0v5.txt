They say you had a character flaw
Every time I say you, you cutting me out
Put a flame at the end of my name
So I know it's real, you see how I feel

I bent a whole lotta cards
Seen a whole lotta of broads, as they walk my way
Stay reaching for the stars
Been in a whole lotta cars with a broken ashtray

But don't you blow your smoke at me
No, don't you blow your smoke at me

Growing is not a contest
But I'm loving all the attention
Forgot all their affection
That I felt for you

But there's always someone to frequent
To feel right for any reason
Don't make it out to be greater
Than two people trying to fuck

Always remember things change
When you move to new lanes
Never know if you stay
We always meet with our friends
Never been for new ends
People fall where they may

But don't you blow your smoke at me
No, don't you blow your smoke at me

(Don't cut me out)
I'm losing the meeting
So fuck how you feeling
I'm reaching the ceiling
It's all so reviling

I bent a whole lotta cards
Seen a whole lotta broads, as they walk by me
Stay reaching for the stars
And a whole lotta cars with some broken ashtrays

But don't you blow your smoke at me
No, don't you blow your smoke at me
