As you can see she hasn't met him yet
She already fell in love, I bet
Her keyboard gets slammed by her fingers
But he replies with "Ok" everytime
Everytime

She doesn't know who he is
No, she doesn't know what he's up to
Ohh
She doesn't know who he is

Yeah

He doesn't see her
He sees right through her
Ohh

She doesn't know who he is
No, she doesn't know what he's up to
Ohh
Her heart gets broken everytime
Everytime
She doesn't know who he is
No she doesn't know what he's up to
Ohh
She doesn't know who he is
She doesn't know who she is
