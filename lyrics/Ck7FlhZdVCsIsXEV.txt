Wild apple trees blooming all around
Sunshine coming through, a rainbow-covered sky
Paints pretty pictures in my mind
Oh what a good day to go fishing
and catch the sunset in the hills
and dream of my yesterdays and tomorrows
and hope that you'd be with me still
Saw a butterfly and named it after you
Your name has such a pleasant sound
Love is all around, and all I see is you
Oh what a good day to go fishing
and catch the sunset in the hills
and dream of my yesterdays and tomorrows
and hope that you'd be with me still
I saw a butterfly and I named it after you
Your name has such a pleasant sound
Love is all around, and all I see is you
