Hu-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na

Seems like yesterday we were sixteen
We were the rebels of the rebel scene
We wore Doc Martens in the sun
Drinking vintage cider, having fun
We were drinking vintage cider having fun

It wasn't often that we'd fight at a-a-all
It wasn't ofte-en he-e-e-e
It wasn't often that we'd fight at a-a-all
It wasn't ofte-en he-e-e-e

Tu-tu-tu-tu, tu-tu, tu-tu
Tu-tu-tu-tu, tu-tu, tu-tu
Tu-tu-tu-tu, tu-tu, tu-tu
Tu-tu-tu-tu

La (na-na-na-na-na-na), la-la-la-la
La (na-na-na-na-na-na), la

We wore Doc Martens in the snow (we will never grow)
Paint our toenails black and let our hair grow (we will never grow)
What I am now is what I was then (we will never know)
I am not more acceptable than then
I am not more acceptable than then

It wasn't often that we'd fight at a-a-all
It wasn't ofte-en he-e-e-e
It wasn't often that we'd fight at a-a-all

It wasn't often, it wasn't often
It wasn't often, it wasn't often
It wasn't often, it wasn't often
It wasn't often, it wasn't ofte-en ha-a
La-a-i la-a-i la-a-u l-a-a-u la-a-u la-a-u la-a la-a la-a la-a-a-a-a-a a-a
