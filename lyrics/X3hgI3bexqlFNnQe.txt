The harrowing adventures of
you and I when we were captains of
Submarines made of steel
Discovering the seven seas
Fending off the giants of the deep
Pendants from hanging teeth

Your ghost did you wrong
When he wiped your spit on the table cloth
I am here to fight
And let your blood in the dim moon light
Two wrongs making right

The harrowing adventures of
You and I before our eyes light up
Shadows cast in the night
Led me to your old home
Set at the tables for two alone
Pass the salt, pour the wine
Because I'm alright if you're alright
