A company
Always on the run
A destiny
Oh, it's the risin' sun
I was born
A shotgun in my hands
Behind the gun
I'll make my final stand, yeah

And that's why they call me
Bad company, I can't deny
Bad, bad company, 'til the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

Rebel souls
Deserters we've been called
Chose a gun
And threw away the sun, oh
Now these towns
Well they all know our name
The death punch sound
Is our claim to fame

That's why they call me
Bad company, I can't deny
Bad, bad company, 'til the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

Eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth
Blood for blood
We've all gotta die
We've all gotta die

And that's why they call me
Bad company, I won't deny
Bad, bad company, 'til the day I die
Bad company, I won't deny
Bad, bad company, 'til the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
