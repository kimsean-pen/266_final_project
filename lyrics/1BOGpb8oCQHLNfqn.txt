We can keep in touch if that's what you want,
you can call me too if that's what friends do.
It's not more than one, if that's what you thought.
You'd say I don't have the time for you,
But I do.

I could stay inside if that's what you want
I won't say a word for a day or two.
When I'm in my room I know what to do about you.

I can sleep, (x3)
soon.

When I get home I am kept from everyone in the house
I'll walk down the hall where you have gone
to feel the way it felt again.

I am what you need when you can't find it somewhere else.
I am what you want when you don't have anything else.
