Everytime I closed my eyes, I saw my astral body in space
For nights on end I watched myself
I knew our pain was the same
Loss
Self doubt
Isolation
Neither constructed or taken away
We have always known our options
It was the relativity of time and space in our shared conscious which brought us together
Now we are one
Two forces entwined to make a decision
