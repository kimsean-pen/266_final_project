If you want your freedom
There is nothing planned
If you really need him
I will understand

Please believe in love
I believe there is a God above
For love
And He's coming, yes He's coming

If you want to fly
Then fly away
All the cloudy skies
Belong to yesterday

Please believe in love
I believe there is a God above
For love
And He's coming, yes He's coming

In the shadows the swallow dies
No one knows the hobo hides
There is no need to apologize
This is the story of a downtown sundown

If you climb the mountain
You will see
There is no great distance
Between the Lord and me

Please believe in love
I believe there is a God above
For love
And He's coming, yes He's coming

In the shadows a swallow dies
No one knows the hobo hides
There is no need to apologize
This is the story of a downtown sundown
