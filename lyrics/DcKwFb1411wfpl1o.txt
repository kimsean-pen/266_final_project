You don't know any of my friends
We're better off without them
I'm trying to keep up with the latest trends
You pulled me up so quick that I got the bends

This must be love
You're the only one that I'm thinking of
People say that we don't need to rush
I don't care, you're my first crush

We spend too much time together
I wanna be with you forever
But we need space
You should stay at your place

Hey look honey, yeah there's the moon
This is gonna be over soon
So many of the things you do
Annoy me like they never used to

Your touch used to be loving
Now it just feels smothering
Something changed, no one's to blame
I try to talk it out but I don't think you want to
So many things inside
So many dark secrets you don't want me to find
It doesn't help that

We spend too much time together
I wanna be with you forever
But we need space
You should stay at your place

We spend too much time alone
When we're not together we talk on the phone
Yeah, we need space
You should stay at your place

I wrote you a letter
I don't know why but it makes me feel better
I haven't seen you for a year
And I just wanna make one thing clear

We spend too much time together
I wanna be with you forever
But we need space
You should stay at your place

We spend too much time alone
When we're not together we talk on the phone
Yeah, we need space
You should stay at your place
