I believe in love, I needed love
I believe in love, it makes you feel like nothings wrong
And I can see that you're in need of some
So I ain't leavin' 'til I make you feel like nothing's wrong

Girl I need for you to hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Girl I need for you to hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand

I ain't throwin' pennies in no fountain
Pullin' petals off of a rose
I ain't gotta think about it
I would already know, if there was something wrong
Ain't no way I could explain it
Either happens or it don't
Ain't no room for second guessing
It's so different from before
Because there's nothin' wrong
Ooo-woah-woah
'Cause there's nothin' wrong

Girl I need for you to hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Girl I need for you to hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand

Only hard to hold you in my arms babe
Safest place you'll go, let me know
If there's somethin' wrong, I got you baby
