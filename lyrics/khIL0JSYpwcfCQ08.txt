You know that niggas is full of lies, oh, oh
You know that niggas is full of tries, oh, oh
You know that niggas is full of lies, oh, oh
You know that niggas is full of tries, oh, oh

Tool, tool I keep the tool, tool
I keep the tool, tool
These tools are for you to use
These tools are for you to use me
Oooh, use me, what you want me for, use me
Oooh, use me, what you want me for, use me
Yeah, oh, use me, ooh-ooh
Use me what you want me for

Guess to the type that you like, they are see-through
Guess you'll rock those when I don't see you
Who piss you off, baby? Tell me what he do
I'll call your ex if you really want me to
I'll grab your whip and take it back to Chi-Town
When I'm in Chi-Town, I treat it like it's my town
I'll scoop your son up from your baby daddy
Brung this boy home, you don't have to deal with nothing

You know that niggas is full of lies, oh, oh
You know that niggas is full of tries, oh, oh
You know that niggas is full of lies, oh, oh
You know that niggas is full of tries, oh, oh
Just so you know, I need you to know how to use me
Any way you can

Karats all in my hand, 'bout to get Xan'd out
I can always lean on these bands when niggas is not around
I got an AK on my shoulder, my trigger finger out
I feel like Pink Floyd with the lean out
I feel like Pretty Boy, Money Team out
Kissin' all the water with my chains out
My life is more effective than a cocaine drop
'Cause I was trappin' at grandma's house when I came out
I said, "Fuck the streets" and made my own lane out
When you get high enough you can dodge raindrops
And tell your mama and your daddy you in a gang now

You know that niggas is full of lies, oh, oh
You know that niggas is full of tries, oh, oh
You know that niggas is full of lies, oh, oh
You know that niggas is full of tries, oh, oh
Just so you know, I need you to know how to use me
Tell me what you're usin' me for

Use me to make me better
Oh, yeah you can use me
Use me, then use me
Then you better, then you
Use me
Use me...
Use me...
