I won't wait for you
If all you want is my money
Gotta get away from you
If all you want is my money
If all you...
Sit back and ride a wave
A tidal wave
Relax don't fight the wave
Light the way

Oh you want a piece of it all?
Look, fuck em I gotta get the money too
I got three to protect I need a money tree
Like what you need the money for?
If you got a reason you need a couple more 'cause...

I can't wait around for you no more

I won't wait for you
If all you want is my money
Gotta get away from you
If all you want is my money
If all you...

No...
Now I can't wait for you no
Woah...
