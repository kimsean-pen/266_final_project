They say all roads lead back to home
That ain't where I wanna go
Or where I wanna be
All these places that I been
All these faces that I seen
Now they're all in front of me

How long 'til I get where I'm goin'?
How far will I go? Ooh
Run until the street signs are foreign
Keep runnin' in the right direction
Fade out but the lights are still glowin'
Tell me where to go, ooh
How long will I run without knowin'
If I'm runnin' in the right direction?

(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Runnin' in the right, runnin' in the right
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

Hotel rooms where I used to stay
All feel so far away
Am I closer than I think?
(Runnin' in the right, runnin' in the right)
They ask me what's my deep desire
I throw up my hands, say:
"I don't mind as long as I don't fall behind"

How long 'til I get where I'm goin'?
How far will I go? Ooh
Run until the street signs are foreign
Keep runnin' in the right direction
Fade out, but the lights are still glowin'
Tell me where to go, ooh
How long will I run without knowin'
If I'm runnin' in the right direction?

Runnin' in the right, runnin' in the right
Runnin' in the right, runnin' in the right direction

I wanna feel that high
Not just a lifetime waiting
Gotta keep on asking why
(Runnin' in the right direction)

How long 'til I get where I'm goin'?
Run until the street signs are foreign
Fade out but the lights are still glowin'
Tell me where to go, ooh
How long will I run without knowin'
If I'm runnin' in the right direction?

Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Running in the right)
Ooh
