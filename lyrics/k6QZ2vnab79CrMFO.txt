I'm alive
I'm alive
Final words of a god left drowning
Burned alive
Burned alive
Scorch the angels out from the skies

Building up the walls to surround us in

From a world built on sin
Building up the strength for the release
From a world corrupted
To be unseen
With the eyes
For it's the ground that we lie on
Open wide
Open mind

Nail your mouths shut it's this world

Building up the walls to surround us in

From a world built on sin
Building up the strength for the release
From a world corrupted
Wasting lives away
Consume to filling
Only waking
For the feeding
Give me spark to light the world
Up in flames reignite
A changing to better
End this now
Pillars
Serpents
Make it over
Give me spark to light the world
Up in flames reignite
A changing to better
End this now
So no more are these dreams of angels
Washed away with the tears
So no more are these dreams of angels
Washed away with the tears
Pillars
Serpents
Make it over
