Today is the first day of the rest
Of our lives
Tomorrow is too late to pretend
Everything's alright now
I'm not gettin' any younger as long
As you don't get any older
I'm not going to see that yesterday never was

Bloodshot deadbeat and a lack of sleep
Making your mascara bleed
Tears down your face
Leaving traces of my mistakes
When I say
If I promise to go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you
And this compromise

I hereby solemnly swear to tell
The whole truth
And nothing but the truth is what
I'll ever hear from you now
Trust is a dirty word that comes
From such a liar
But respect is something I will earn
If you have faith
Bloodshot deadbeat and a lack of sleep
Making your mascara bleed
Tears down your face
Leaving traces of my mistakes
When I say
If I promise to go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you
And this compromise

If I promise to go to church on Sunday,
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you
And this compromise

Let's go!
Hey, hey!

If I promise to go to church on Sunday,
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you
And this compromise

If I promise to go to church on Sunday,
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you
And this compromise
And this compromise
Let's have compromise!
