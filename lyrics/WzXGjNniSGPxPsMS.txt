Run

Breaking my back until I can't even stand
I'm working my hands until my callouses bled again
I'm breaking my back for it again
I'm living like this is the end, last chance to start dance

Run for your life
Passing the enemy
Run for your life
And it's apart of me
Run for your life
Color humanity
Programmed inside of me
Freedom denied
Run for your life

Looking at time and wonder where it was spent
Looking at lives until we can't recognize ourselves
I'm breaking my back for it again
I'm living like this is the end, last chance to start to dance

Run for your life
Passing the enemy
Run for your life
And it's apart of me
Run for your life
Color humanity
Programmed inside of me
Freedom denied
Run for your life

Run for your life

Consequences of living in a lie
Pain of time
Consequences they will provide, yeah

Run for your life
Passing the enemy
Run for your life
And it's apart of me
Run for your life
Color humanity
Programmed inside of me
Freedom denied
Run for your life

I want you to take control right now
Don't care how
Because they all lay down
(Run for your life)
We'll take control right now
Don't care how
Because they all lay down
(Run for your life)
Just run

Run for your life
