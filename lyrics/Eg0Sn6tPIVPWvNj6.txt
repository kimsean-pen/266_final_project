One or the other
One or the other
One or the other
If it's gonna be her, you gotta set me free

If you think you're gonna have the time
To make up your mind, you shouldn't even try
I'm tired of hearing all of your lines
Just tell me that you're mine

You know I'm better than she'll ever be
It's very clear to me, no more
I'll let you mess with me
But baby can't you see

You can only have one or the other
Is it gonna be her or is it gonna be me?
You can only have one or the other
If it's gonna be her, you gotta set me free

You can only have one or the other
Is it gonna be her or is it gonna be me?
You can only have one or the other
If it's gonna be her, you gotta set me free

Let me tell you that it hurts so bad
When you're the last to know, my friends told me so
My heart was always just for you
But now you want her too

You see her, you try her, you're always on fire
But boy I've got news for you
You've taken advantage but baby you can't have
Your cake and eat it too

You can only have one or the other
Is it gonna be her or is it gonna be me?
You can only have one or the other
If it's gonna be her, you gotta set me free

One or the other, you can't get it right
You say I'm your lover but someone else is waiting
One or the other, I'm not gonna fight
This won't last forever so stop your hesitating

One or the other, you can't get it right
You're so undercover you always think I'm playing
One or the other, you want me tonight
I'm not gonna play it boy, I'm not with it

You're gonna mess around

So you think you can have it all
One or the other
'Cause if you can play, so can I
One or the other, play
One or the other

You can only have one or the other
Is it gonna be her or is it gonna be me?
You can only have one or the other
If it's gonna be her, you gotta set me free

One or the other
You got to get it right
Said ya can't have
Your cake and eat it too

One or the other
You got to get it right
Said ya can't have
Your cake and eat it too

One or the other
One or the other
You got to get it right
Said ya can't have
Your cake and eat it too

One or the other
You got to get it right
Said ya can't have
Your cake and eat it too

One or the other
One or the other
One or the other
One or the other
