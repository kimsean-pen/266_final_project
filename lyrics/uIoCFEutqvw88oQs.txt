When the going gets tough
The tough become an addict
Buried down hard on a horrible line
Demonic by dawn, lead me to the attic
I don't wanna be dead
But I'm barely alive

So sattle up mother, join the schizophrenic
It's a goddamn shame what you're doing to me
Giving up ghosts, taking all the credit
Another fine job, just abandon the dream

I can't decide whichever one is better
Undefined, you've gotta spell it out
Why am I continuing to wither
I'm into it
I'm into it

I don't need
Information
I don't need
Irritation

Underneath the fog is just another killer
Reliable amalgam with a comical phase
Where do I stop, God I sound bitter
Forget about the innocent, go to your cage

Here we go again, a simple motherfucker
Who is out of this world and into the kink
Keep it in your pants, can I get an amen?
Don't even bother
'Cause they tell you what to think

Decide whichever one is better
Undefined, you've gotta spell it out
Why am I continuing to wither
I'm into it
I'm into it

I don't need information
I don't need irritation

Just once I'd like to know
Where the pain, the shame and the spirit will go
Looks like I'm here to stay
Another bloody mess who's ready to be saved

I can't decide whichever one is better
Undefined, you've gotta spell it out
Why am I continuing to wither
I'm into it
I'm into it

I don't need information
I don't need irritation

Just once I'd like to know
Where the pain, the shame and the spirit will go
Looks like I'm here to stay
Another bloody mess who's willing to be saved

Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna save me? Oh
Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna save me?
