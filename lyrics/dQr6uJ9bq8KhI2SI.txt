When flowers bloom
even in the spring time
we came for two
sail on the sea
some people
they want you
lifting all your lift(?)
we keep your eyesight
on the boat
oh, ohhh, ohhhh, oohhhhh
oh, ohhh, ohhhh, oohhhhh

when reached the wall
even in awhile you sit
in a windy ocean
far from me
some people they want you
dripping on your feet
we keep your eyesight
?
oh, ohhh, ohhhh, oohhhhh
oh, ohhh, ohhhh, oohhhhh
