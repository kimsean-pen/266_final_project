Hey!

Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Somethin' to fill in the holes
We think a lot but don't talk much about it
'Til things get out of control

Oh!
(How do I know when it's love?)
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
(How does it feel when it's love?)
It's just something you feel together
When it's love

You look at every face in a crowd
Some shine and some keep you guessin'
Waitin' for someone to come into focus
Teach you your final love lesson

Oh!
(How do I know when it's love?)
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
O-oh!
(How does it feel when it's love?)
It's just something you feel together

(O-o-o-oh)
Oh, when it's love
(O-o-o-oh)
You can feel it, yeah!
(O-o-o-oh)
Nothing's missing, yeah!

(O-o-o-oh)
Yeah, you can feel it
(O-o-o-oh)
Oh, when it's love
(O-o-o-oh)
Nothing's missing
Aw!

(How do I know when it's love?)
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
U-uh!
(How does it feel when it's love?)
It's just something you feel together
Hey!

(How do I know when it's love?)
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
When it's love

Hu-u!
When it's love
Hey!
It lasts forever
When it's love

(Na na na na na, na)
When it's love
(Na na na na na, na)
(Na na na na na, na)
(Na na na na na, na)
You and I
We're gonna feel this thing together
(Na na na na na, na)
When it's love
(Na na na na na, na)
Oh, when it's love, baby
(Na na na na na, na)
(Na na na na na, na)
You can feel it, yeah!
(Na na na na na, na)
(Na na na na na, na)
We'll make it last forever
(Na na na na na, na)
(Na na na na na, na)
Oh, it's love
