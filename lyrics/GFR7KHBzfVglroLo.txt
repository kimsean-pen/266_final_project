Got that bottom of the ocean
Pressure, pressure
Pushing down on me alone
Whoo hoo hoo hooo

Got that I'm in outer space kind
Pressure, pressure
Thinkin' my body might explode

Shackle me up in locket
I can live in your pocket
When you gonna kidnap me
When you gonna kidnap me

Take me away from here
I can see it so clearly
You gotta kidnap me
You gotta kidnap me

So call the cops and tell 'em I've gone
Missin', missin'
They throw the case into the file
Whoo hoo hoo hooo

I call my mom and tell her don't you
Worry, worry
I'll see you in a little while

Shackle me up in locket
I can live in your pocket
When you gonna kidnap me
When you gonna kidnap me

Take me away from here
I can see it so clearly
You gotta kidnap me
You gotta kidnap me

Oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh
Oh oh oh
You're never gonna catch us
Oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh
Oh oh oh
You're never gonna catch us
Oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh
Oh oh oh
You're never gonna catch us

And anyway I need to
Anyway I need you

Shackle me up in locket
I can live in your pocket
When you gonna kidnap me
When you gonna kidnap me
Whoo hoo hoo hooo

Take me away from here
I can see it so clearly
You gotta kidnap me
You gotta kidnap me
Whoo hoo hoo hooo

Tell me you'll do it, dear
I can live in your air
When you gonna kidnap me
When you gonna kidnap me
Whoo hoo hoo hooo

Take me away from here
I can see it so clearly
You gotta kidnap me
You gotta kidnap me
Whoo hoo hoo hooo
