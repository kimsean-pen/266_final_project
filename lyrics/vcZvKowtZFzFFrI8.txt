An ordinary sunset
An ordinary day
An ordinary sunset
I'll let you down again
An ordinary sunset
An ordinary day
An ordinary sunset
I'll let you down again

On your own I'd let you fall down
In a garden full of bees
On your own, picking through lilacs
Covered in gold and kicking through the bellyache

Covering miles in a broken car
Covering miles in a broken car
Covered in gold and kicking through the bellyache
Covering miles in a broken car
Covering miles in a broken car
Covered in gold and kicking through the bellyache

On your own I'd take the beating
Then again I thought I'd say
Will it hit you when the feelings right?

On your own I'd let you fall down
In a garden full of bees
On your own, picking through lilacs
Covered in gold and kicking through the bellyache

Covering miles in a broken car
Covering miles in a broken car
Covered in gold and kicking through the bellyache
Covering miles in a broken car
Covering miles in a broken car
Covered in gold and kicking through the bellyache

An ordinary sunset
An ordinary day
An ordinary sunset
I'll let you down again
An ordinary sunset
An ordinary day
An ordinary sunset
I'll let you down again
An ordinary sunset
An ordinary day
An ordinary sunset
I'll let you down again
An ordinary sunset
An ordinary day
Covered in gold and
Covered in gold and kicking through the bellyache

(An ordinary sunset, an ordinary day)
Covered in gold and
Covered in gold and kicking through the bellyache (An ordinary sunset, I'll let you down again)
An ordinary sunset
An ordinary day
Covered in gold and
Covered in gold and kicking through the bellyache
