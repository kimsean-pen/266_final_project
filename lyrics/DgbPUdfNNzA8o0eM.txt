I love the dead before they're cold
They're bluing flesh for me to hold
Cadaver eyes upon me see.Nothing
I love the dead before they rise
No farwells, No goodbyes
I never even knew your now rotting face
While friends and lovers morn your silly grave
I have other uses for you, Darling

I love the dead

I love the dead

I love the dead

I love the dead

I love the dead

I love the dead

I love the dead before they're cold
They're bluing flesh for me to hold
Cadaver eyes upon me see... Nothing
