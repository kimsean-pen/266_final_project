Dropping off the grid
Gonna occupy the sidelines
Rolling out the city
Now were finished with the high light
Same line everytime
From the book
You give me the same line everytime
Seeing that much river as it flows into the deep blue
Jumping off together cause it's only really us two
Sinking ever deeper
Cause I never really tried to break through
To you

Swimming at night
Fall under water
We'll be living with life forms underwater
Swimming at night
Fall under water
We'll be living with life forms

Swimming at night
Fall under water
We'll be living with life forms underwater
swimming at night
Fall under water
We'll be living with life forms

Heaven's all around
But were living out the same light
Call another number
Cause the conversation's couldn't run dry
Same line everytime
From the book
You give me the same line everytime

Current getting stronger
Stormy water look again now
Hold our breath together
And we'll try to make it somehow
Sinking ever deeper
Cause I never really try to stay true
To you

Swimming at night
Fall under water
We'll be living with life forms underwater
Swimming at night
Fall under water
We'll be living with life forms

Swimming at night
Fall under water
We'll be living with life forms underwater
Swimming at night
Fall under water
We'll be living with life forms
