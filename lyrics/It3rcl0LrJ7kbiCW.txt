I've been patient too long
My memory's dead
All fears and all wrongs
To the heavens have fled

With a fierce buzzing rise
While all my pain's burst
Oh come the filthy flies
And their sickly thirst
Oh may it come
The time of love
Oh the time we would be
Enamored of

I've waited for too long
Lord and I've done nothing wrong
Please don't feel bad
But be free

So many days I've spent
Many times I've tried
To give a name to the thing that ails you though
I know I haven't the right
All the reasons I've built up
All advice that I gave
Drifted on like so many floats
It's a senseless parade

Oh may it come
The time of love
Oh the time we would be
Enamored of
I've waited for too long
Lord and I've done nothing wrong
Please don't feel bad
Be free

All this misplaced affection
Is like a charm or a spell
Well you know it makes you feel so fine
While it lays waste to your health

Everyone I see
Everywhere that I go
Well you know it's just how you feel
It's not what you know

Oh may it come
The time of love
Oh the time we would be
Enamored of
I've waited for too long
Lord and I've done nothing wrong
Please don't feel bad
Be free

All the feeling that has gone
All the sense that has left
Taken leave and gone abroad
Other worlds as you slept

It wouldn't be much different
It would be quite the same
All the evil you can possibly dream and
No one to blame

Oh may it come
The time of love
Oh the time we would be
Enamored of
I've waited for too long
Lord and I've done nothing wrong
Please don't feel bad
But be free
