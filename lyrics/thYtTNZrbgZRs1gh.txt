Loving you is easy
I can do it in my sleep
I dream of you so often
It's like you never leave
But you're gone below the border
With a nightmare in between
I'm sending the coyote
To bring you back to me

Where there's a fancy hotel waiting
In south San Gabriel
Where the movie madams sunbathe
The playboys para-sail
And I know you think I'm crazy
But most people they can't tell
So I'll meet you there tomorrow
If I can have you to myself

Inside the time I tried to occupy or waste
Since you've been away
It's hard our plans are stalled on calling cards
I can't see your poker face
While your voice is sounding so brave

Our Lady Guadalupe
In plaster on the wall
Joseph Smith saw Jesus in America
Well I don't know much about it
It doesn't matter much at all
Just keep your head down lady
As you travel through the dark

And if I should seem distracted
By the color of the sky
As a copper wire sunset plays a lullaby
It's just to know they've stolen
Another day from you and I
It gets me feeling low down
When the moon is fulling high

They bait the route
To take the place that's safe
That you might wait a day

A lonesome broken dawn
That finally comes
Just as I was losing faith
You keep every promise you make

Loving you is easy
I can do it in my sleep
I dream of you so often
It's like you never leave
But you're gone below the border
With a nightmare in between
So I'm sending the coyote
To bring you back to me
Yes I'm sending the coyote
To bring you back to me
