The scent of momentum fills the city air
Hear the heart beat, it's alive and draws you in
Things will never be the same
Thought I'd been here, but never here times before
Then the roller coaster dipped and sped along no more
But I'm not in the same space.
Cuz I'm hardly the woman that I once was

Now I search for the ground underneath my feet
As the city burns, as the city burns

Ooh As the city burns
Ooh as the city burns
Ooh as the city burns
Burn away
Burn away

Now it's fancy ladies, pricey wiles, and argyle
From homemade beats, selling tee's, Running wild
Just hope I don't lose my head
Now I'm thinking on a dream that my sister had
Back then I was too young to see it wasn't bad
So thanks chick, by the way
Cuz I'm hardly the woman that I once was

Now I search for the ground underneath my feet
As the city burns, as the city burns
Ooh As the city burns
Ooh as the city burns
Ooh as the city burns
Burn away
Burn away

We're at a run right now
Before we were at a steady jog
I'm trying to hang on to whatever I can find
'Cause what do you do when it's spinning so fast
How do you stand with the world on your back
I'm hardly the woman I once was
Search for the ground underneath my feet
As the city burns, as the city burns

Ooh As the city burns
Ooh as the city burns
Ooh
Burn away
Burn away
