Pick it up
This'll get you out of your head

China's hangin' out by the railings
Of the motorshed
She goes with a real hit biker
He's a metalhead
She looks me up and down
Talkin' dirty eyes
Sweet sayin' boy baby
I could lick ya any time

Keep it up
That's right... Here we go again

Bit later I'm gonna run
Into her round the back
While other guys break heads
In the Sugar Shack
Don't give me drink I don't wanna
Get too stoned
Then we're gonna see who's gonna
Take who home

The violence of summer
A love's taking over
It starts with desire
Ends up under cover

Those lips will make me rise
You may look down but don't think twice
Slow death is on the way
So what man I still want to play...

One, two
This'll get you out of your mind
This'll get you up... Let's go

Maybe take a ride goin' south
Where her mother writes
Before bad news catches up
We still got a little time
We'll leave it all so far away
One thing is sure we shouldn't stay
I take it all little Chine gonna
Get the runaround a run... A runaround

The violence of summer
A love's taking over
It starts with desire
Ends up under cover

China... Na china... Nanana
China... Na china... Nanana
China... Na china... Nanana
China... Na china... Nana

The violence of summer
A love's taking over
It starts with desire
Ends up under cover... Mmm... Love's takin' over
Yes love's takin' over
Love's takin over...
