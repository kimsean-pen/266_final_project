Gimme just a little break
Ain't no more that I can take
I am asking for the planets to align

Calling on the universe
Maybe once, just put me first
Gimme what I need or give a little sign

Nothing plays out like it should
And nothing does me any good
'Cause I'm missing you, it's making me cry

Ooh, I know it's turning
Inside I'm burning...

I'm so tired of the way the world works
I'm so tired of the way the world works
They conspire trying to keep this apart

Nothing ventured, nothing gained
I don't mind a little pain
But enough's enough

But does the heart grow fonder?
Will I wait here on ya?
Baby, how much longer?

Ooh, I know it's turning
All I am learning is...

I'm so tired of the way the world works
I'm so tired of the way the world works
They conspire trying to keep this apart

There's so much in life that's undecided
There's so much to avoid, let's not invite it
And only so much you can control

What are the voices that try and tease us
I wish the voices would just release us
I haven't seen you in forever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, baby

(Hey, hey, gimme just a little break, hey, hey, ain't no more that I can take, hey, hey)

They're trying to keep us apart

I'm so tired of the way the world works
I'm so tired of the way the world works
They conspire trying to keep this apart

I'm so tired of the way the world works
I'm so tired of the way the world works
They conspire trying to keep this apart
