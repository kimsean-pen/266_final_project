Tonight is the first night
Tonight is the last night
Don t care what has come before
Tomorrow s an open door
So box to the ropes
Jump in the crowd
Throw up your hands and sing it out loud
Oh tonight

Well it might the shame
It might be the sorrow
To be back on the rocks
This time around
I ve seen the sunshine
Yea I ve seen the rain
When you walk the line brilliance
Can sound insane but

Tonight is the first night
Tonight is the last night
Don t care what has come before
Tomorrow s an open door
So box to the ropes
Jump in the crowd
Throw up your hands sing it out loud

And say what you mean
And mean what you say
And tonight
Chase down the dream and
Don t give up without a fight
And don t wait for tomorrow s day light
Cause it just might be tonight

Too tired to walk and I m too scared to run
And your heavy wing is buckling under itself
Blue sky visions turn into a storm
I ve got suspicions you won t make it one more
When there s no silver lining and There s nothing to lose
Don t wait for tomorrow, don t wait for tomorrow

Cause Tonight is the first night
Tonight is the last night
Don t care what has come before
Tomorrow s an open door
So box to the ropes
Jump in the crowd
Throw up your hands sing it out loud
Oh Tonight

Say what you mean
And mean what you say
And tonight
Chase down the dream and don t give up without a fight
And don t wait for tomorrow s daylight
Cause it just might be tonight

I say oh, oh, oh

Don t wait for tomorrow
Don t wait cause it just might be
Don t wait for tomorrow
Don t wait cause it just might be
Don t wait for tomorrow
Don t wait cause it just might be
Don t wait for tomorrow
Don t wait cause it just might be
Don t wait for tomorrow
Don t wait cause it just might be
Don t wait for tomorrow
Don t wait cause it just might be
Don t wait for tomorrow
Don t wait cause it just might be
Don t wait for tomorrow
Don t wait cause it just might be
Don t wait for tomorrow
Don t wait cause it just might be
Don t wait for tomorrow
Don t wait cause it just might be
Don t wait for tomorrow
Don t wait cause it just might be
