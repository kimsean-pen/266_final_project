Just wait and see, just sit and breathe
Your life's unimportant, your ego's distorted, just let what is be
Delusions of control, how's the wool feel?
Pre-decision doesn't mean that this is not real
Why throw away what you've been given to spite it?
What will be will be

Children of the world, dream in peace
The fourth will watch over you; sleep, and you'll know the truth
Children of the world, dream in peace
Here, rebuild in solitude, Under Denver calling you

You're not alone, your truth is wrong
It's best to accept it, no sense in resisting, just let what is be
Listen, follow orders, buy, consume, sell
Stay on the surface, it's okay to trust the system
Tried and tested, they know best, they know the outcome
What will be will be

Children of the world, dream in peace
The fourth will watch over you; sleep, and you'll know the truth
Children of the world, dream in peace
Here, rebuild in solitude, Under Denver calling you

They're more than we
They hold the keys
They live in the silence
Just offer compliance, and what will be will be

Children of the world, dream in peace
The fourth will watch over you; sleep, and you'll know the truth
Children of the world, dream in peace
Here, rebuild in solitude, Under Denver calling you
