I breed deep in my a beautiful thing
And I need energy for my beautiful thing
But pain for days has stayed with me
Expect to see some change in me
From happy to frown

I'm on my way down
I'm on my way down
I'm on my way down
I'm on my way down

I know noisy noisy please this fool
So hear my plan and understand why I feel so cruel
Take this huge expanse of sound
And wrap it in these rags I found
And in true style

I'm on my way down

Oh this is worth the cost she said
This is worth every penny she said
And I think I can see through everything
This is how I feel This is how I feel This is how I feel

I'm on my way down
I'm on my way down
