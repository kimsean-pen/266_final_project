Toma
Toma
Toma
Toma
Toma away
Stole my patience, stole my bribe
Snatched the rhythm from my stride
Kicked my certainty up the middle
Knocked the wind out of my romantic side

Hopes and wishes set aflame
What's your purpose here, whatcha hope to gain?
Took my dignity, took my dignity
Burned a lover so earned an enemy
Time to make it right, how it's s'posed to be.
Watched you beg and drool right in front of me
Time to beg of you, time to set you straight
Take what you dish out, Toma away.

Lost a lover and earned an enemy
Time to make it right, how it's gonna to be.
Watched you beg and drool right in front of me
Time to beg of you, time to set you straight
Take what you dish out, Toma away.

Time to make it right, it's how it's gonna to be.
Watched you beg and drool right in front of me
Time to pay your dues, time to set you straight
Take what you dish out, Toma away.

Time to make it right, it's how it's gonna to be.
