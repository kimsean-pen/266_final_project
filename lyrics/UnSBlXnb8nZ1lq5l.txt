Please don't you ever ask me things I wouldn't like to talk about
It's time to get in touch with things, we always used to dream about
I'll take a train in technicolor
Come along be nice to me my girl
Through the window, the nice thing on earth will pass by
Moving slowly
Though the wide screen I'm gonna see me kissing you babe
In tecnicolor
Oh! What a nice film we would be, if only you could come with me
It's time to get in touch with things we only used to care about
I'll take a train in technicolor
Come along be nice to me my girl
Through the window, the nice thing on earth will pass by
Moving slowly
Though the wide screen I'm gonna see me kissing you babe
In tecnicolor
In tecnicolor
