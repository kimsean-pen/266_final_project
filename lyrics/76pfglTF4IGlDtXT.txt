I want to kill, I don't want to be killed, I'm a simple man
I want to love,
I don't want to be loved, now you fucked up all my plans
Don't want to die or take a seat at the table
I'm not willing, not ready, not able
Everybody come close or I'll explode

Don't calm me down when all I want is a reason to stay awake
I nailed myself to the cross of an empty bed with a sick mistake
I said I'm sorry but I say it so much,
goddamn I get the feeling that I'm losing my touch
Don't look at me like that, I know, I know

We are stars colliding
We are cells dividing
We have all the time in the world but never the timing

We are stars colliding
We are cells dividing
We have all the time in the world but never the timing

I'm in a hurry, let's get this wrong, I'm a busy man
Made my confession in the back of a car on a broken promised land
I know the devil, I have god as my witness
Come raise the dead, 'cause I'm not willing to miss this
No, you stay right here, I'll go, I'll go

We are stars colliding
We are cells dividing
We have all the time in the world but never the timing

We are stars colliding
We are cells dividing
We have all the time in the world but never the timing
