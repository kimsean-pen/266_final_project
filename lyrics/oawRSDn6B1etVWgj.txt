It's impossible to see
All the things we used to be
And it's impossible to say
Why I always feel this way

It's impossible to find
The feeling that we left behind
And it's impossible to stay
When you make me feel this way

It's impossible to see
All the things we used to be
And it's impossible to say
Why I always feel this way

It's impossible to find
The feeling that we left behind
And it's impossible to stay
When you make me feel this way
