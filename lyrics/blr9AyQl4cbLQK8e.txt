I'm down to one last cigarette
And perhaps two steps left
Please God don't make me feel anymore, anymore

What did you save for me
What did you pay for

I can't understand this mess
I am more than this
I am more than worthless
I want more
I need more
I am worth more
More than worthless

Can't feel the empty glass in my hand
Or taste the bitter wine upon my lips
Please God don't make me love anymore

I want you to know
I need you to know
That I'll be right here right here
I want you to feel
That everything is real
What I feel is still real
