In the dark
You have nothing left
I will take it
I will take it

In the dark
You have nothing left
Let me take it

Come closer
Come closer
Come closer

You have got
A dirty little secret
Can I keep it?

Come closer
Come closer
Come closer

Sometimes I find I need another
Another trouble
Another trouble

Sometimes I find I need
Another
One more trouble

Come closer
Come closer
Come closer

What do you got?
Where you gonna find me?
You won't find me

You won't find me

What have you got?
Where you gonna find me?
You won't find me

Come closer
Come closer
Come closer
Come closer

What, what, what

What have you got -
It's what I want
What have you got -
It's what I want

Come closer

Come closer
Come closer
Come closer
