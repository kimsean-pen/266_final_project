Dead cold reverie
The spell of winter

Under her pitch-black wings
Relentless never-ending
Kaamos prevails

The end, the final descent of the sun
The time of perpetual darkness

When the light has died
Shadows will rise
From strength of the moon

Dead white scenery
A parallel dimension

Above the frozen fields
Eternal everlasting darkness remains

The woods echoes
The howling from afar
The cry of the final hunter

Now the light has died
And the shadows will rise
From the strength of the moon
