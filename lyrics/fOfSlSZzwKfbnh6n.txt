Another day goes without any change
The feeling we live with still remains
We're stuck in a hole, and we're searching for anything
To hold on to
There has to be somewhere that we can be safe
From the lives we live each day
There has to be somewhere that we can be far away

We have to escape, and I will go anywhere
If you just lead the way
Escape to a place where we'll be together
Together every day
We have to escape

We could be living how we wanted to, (we wanted to)
Instead of doing things we're forced to do
With no one to tell us that we should be going through
What they went through
There has to be some place that nobody knows, (nobody knows)
Somewhere we can only go
There has to be some place that we can be all alone

We have to escape, and I will go anywhere
If you just lead the way
Escape to a place where we'll be together
Together every day
We have to escape, and I will go anywhere
If you just lead the way.
Escape to a place where we'll be together
Together every day
Oh, together everyday
Oh, yeah

We have to escape... (escape)
We have to escape... (escape)
We have to escape, and I will go anywhere
If you just lead the way
Escape to a place where we'll be together
Together every day

We have to escape, (escape) and I will go anywhere
If you just lead the way
Escape to a place (escape) where we'll be together
Together every day
We have to escape...
