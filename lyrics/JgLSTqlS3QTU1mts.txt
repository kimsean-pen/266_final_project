Nothing is perfect
Treat myself like an insect
Wrap my life in a web just waiting for the end
Got me feelin' all crashed out
I'm your hooker all smacked out
In your head you're the landlord, I'm the one paying rent

Either you're all in, or all out
So get the fuck in babe, or get the fuck out

My heart needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
(Sometimes when I'm high I get so low)
My heart needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
(Sometimes when I'm high I get so low)

You're a hit and a miss
But I signed up for this
She's got the poisonous kiss designed to drag me down
We're hopeless in hell
I'm caught in a meltdown
And you have him a junkie for your desperate love
Treat me like your voodoo doll
You've got me screaming, oh oh
Sexy girl do what you're told
Let loose before I let go

Either you're all in, or all out
So get the fuck in babe, or get the fuck out

My heart needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
(Sometimes when I'm high I get so low)
My heart needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
(Sometimes when I'm high I get so low)

Yeah
Hey, hey
Yeah
Get the fuck in babe, or get the fuck out
Either you're all in, or all out
Get the fuck in babe, or get the fuck out
Either you're all in, or all out
Get the fuck in babe, or get the fuck out
Either you're all in, or all out
Get the fuck in babe, or get the fuck out

My heart needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
Sometimes when I'm high I get so low
My heart needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
Sometimes when I'm high I get so low
My heart needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
Sometimes when I'm high I get so low
My heart needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
Needs to breathe
Sometimes when I'm high I get so low
(My heart needs to breathe)
(Needs to breathe)
(Needs to breathe)
(My heart needs to breathe)
(Needs to breathe)
(Needs to breathe)
