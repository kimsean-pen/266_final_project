All the time

Some people just want lie on the beaches in the Caribbean
Some people want to do crazy things to green amphibians
Some people want some people to do as they please
We just want to have a good time

All the time
All the time
All the time
All the time

Some people go ooh quoi quoi they go qui
Some people have nothing and want nothing and are free
Some people want to burn the world with their greed
We just want to have a good time

Just want good time We just want good time
Just want good time We just want good time
I Just want good time We just want good time
I Just want good time

All the time

We just want to have a good time tonight
We just want to have a good time all the time
We just want to have a good time tonight
We just want to have a good time all the time

Some people want pussy pussy pussy marijuana
Some people want nothing only staying home with mama
Some people want nothing and need nothing and are free
We just want to have a good time

I just want good time We just want good time
Just want good time We just want good time
Just want good time Just want good time

All the time
