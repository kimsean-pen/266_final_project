Between me and you
I've been thinking about the future and
Between me and you
I think I'm losing it now

Between me and you
I've been worried about the future and
Between me and you
I think I'm losing it now

And all my life
I've been told
Follow your dreams
But the trail went cold
And the heart don't lie
And that's a good luck charm
But I'm watching it tear out, up my arms

There's a power in letting go
I guess I didn't want to let you know
These hours I'm working ain't nearly enough
Sometimes it's like a bullet came and blasted me right out of the blue
But I'm doing my best
Not to let it get
Between me and you

Between me and you
I've been struggling just to carry the weight
Between me and you
I think I'm losing it now

The first time that
I saw your face
Time stood still
I found my place
Now I'm watching it tear out, up my arms

There's a power in letting go
I guess I didn't want to let you know
These hours I'm working ain't nearly enough
Chasing every dollar
Girl is this what I was born to do?
But I'm doing my best
Not to let it get
Between me and you

I remember you and why
In the garden
It's been trial after trial
Through the ringer in the back
Out the window off the sack
I was just to proud to know

There's a power in letting go
Never I thought it would be so hard
These hours I'm working ain't nearly enough
Sometimes it's like a bullet came and blasted me right out of the blue
And I feel like I've got nothing to show
But this life and I've been wondering
What am I supposed to do?

But I'm doing my best
Not to let it get
And I'm doing my best
Not to let it get
And I'm doing my best
Not to let it get
Between me and you
