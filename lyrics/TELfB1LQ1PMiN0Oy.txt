Why did you do that?
We're not talking anymore
Why did you do that?
I know something you don't know

You take good care of yourself
You take good care of your friends
As you drag them by the hair
It's a secret you won't share with me

Do what you're told
You didn't see it, cover up and go
Do what you're told

I caught you kissing on the back stairs
No it's not fair
I caught you kissing on the back stairs
Are you not scared?
I saw you kill him on the back stairs

So keep your hands by your side
Is it too much to be kind
You don't drink to his health
Through your arms he fell

You take good care of friends
You take good care of yourself
As you drag them by the hair
Still the secret you don't share with me

Do what you're told
You didn't see it, cover up and go
Do what you're told

I saw you kill him on the back stairs
No it's not fair
I caught you kissing on the back stairs
Are you not scared?
I saw you kill him on the back stairs

You're kicking him
You're killing him
You're kicking him

I caught you kissing on the back stairs
I saw you kicking
I saw you kicking him, kicking him
I saw you kill him
I caught you kissing on the back stairs
You're kicking him
You're killing him
You're kicking him
