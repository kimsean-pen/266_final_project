Sometimes I don't feel like myself
Sometimes I feel like someone else
Sometimes I don't feel like myself
Sometimes I feel the need to be someone else

All this time to understand
The conditions of strangers
And now I'm one of them
One of them

I'm a stranger in this land
Like a beetle on your hand
I am a thief
Of scope

And the hopeless roots of rose
Sink down what time had chosen to decay
For you

All this time to understand
The conditions of strangers
And now I'm one of them

All this time invested in
To see if we share equal sins
And I know it now

Stranger in this land
I'm fool that's dancing strangely on your hand
A dirty thief
Of hope

A hopeless man of rose
A thing that time had chosen
For decay
And you

All this time to understand
The conditions of strangers and
Now I'm one of them

All this time invested in
To see if we share equal sins
And I'm running through this pastel grove
I'm the stranger
