Baby take off your coat

Real slow
Take off your shoes
I'll take off your shoes
Baby, take off your dress

Yes, yes, yes
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on

You can leave your hat on
Go over there, turn on the lights
All the lights
Come back here, stand on that chair
Get up woman, that's right
Raise your arms up in the air

And now shake 'em
You give me a reason to live
You give me a reason to live
You give me a reason to live

You give me a reason to live
Sweet darling
(You can leave your hat on)
Just leave your hat on, girl
A little wild man
(You can leave your hat on)
Leave your hat on
(You can leave your hat on)

(You can leave your hat on)
Suspicious minds are talkin'
They're tryin' to tear us apart
They don't believe in this love of mine

They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is

I know what love is
And baby, put it my way
(You can leave your hat on)
And just leave your hat on now
They don't wanna
(You can leave your hat on)
Won't you do that for me, babe?
(You can leave your hat on)
And just leave your hat on, girl
(You can leave your hat on)
