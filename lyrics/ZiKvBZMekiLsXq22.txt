When the moonlight crawls along the street
Chasing away the summer heat
Footsteps outside somewhere below
The world revolves I've let it go

We build our church above the street
We practice love between these sheets
The candy sweetness scent of you
It bathes my skin I'm stained of you

And all I have to do is hold you
There's a racing within my heart
And I am barely touching you... Oh, oh, oh.

Turn the lights down low
Take it off

Let me show
My love for you
Insatiable

Turn me on

Never stop
Wanna taste every drop

My love for you
Insatiable
Oh, oh, oh... oh, yeah.
The moonlight plays upon your skin

A kiss that lingers takes me in
I fall asleep inside of you
There are no words

There's only truth
Breathe in Breathe out

There is no sound
We move together up and down
We levitate our bodies soar

Our feet don't even touch the floor
But nobody knows you like I do
'Cause the world may not understand
That I grow stronger in your hands, oh, oh, oh...

Turn the lights down low

Take it off
Let me show
My love for you
Insatiable
Turn me on

Never stop
Wanna taste every drop
My love for you
Insatiable
Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show
My love for you
Insatiable
Turn me on
Never stop
Wanna taste every drop
My love for you
Insatiable baby, oh, yeah
We never sleep we're always holdin' hands
Kissin' for hours talkin' makin' plans
I feel like a better man
Just being in the same room
We never sleep there's just so much to do
So much to say
Can't close my eyes when I'm with you
Insatiable the way I'm loving you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, baby
Yeah, oh, oh
Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show
My love for you
Insatiable
Turn me on
Never stop
Wanna taste every drop
My love for you
Insatiable
Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show
My love for you
Insatiable
Turn me on
Never stop
Wanna taste every drop
My love for you
is Insatiable baby.
oh, oh, baby
oh, oh
When I look in your eyes
Insatiable
The way I'm loving you
Oh, what can I do
Insatiable
Insatiable
For you
Insatiable
My love for you
Insatiable
My love for you
Insatiable
My love for you
Insatiable
My love for you
Insatiable
My love for you
