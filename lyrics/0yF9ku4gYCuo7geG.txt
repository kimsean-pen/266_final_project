Walking down the Mercer St
Been a long hot summer
Rain like daggers coming
Down on me
Get a feeling it's too late
But alone, together, could
Be we might start it up
Allover again

Dream, real
You're not too late
Sweet road to somewhere else

Listen to the radio
Are you calling?

3'o clock I'm on my way
On the road to somewhere
Little clouds like wounds
That blow away

Listening to the radio like a
Friend that guides me
Playing out every song
We used to know

Dream, real
You're not too late
Sweet road to somewhere else

Listen to the radio
Are you calling?

Bring it on, come along
On the road to somewhere
Take our time, see the signs
On the road to somewhere

Bring it on, come along
On the road to somewhere
Listen to the radio
Are you calling?

Take our time, see the signs
On the road to somewhere
Listen to the radio
Are you calling?
