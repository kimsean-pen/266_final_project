(Back to me)

Lovers walk off on each other
Brothers go their separate ways
You wake up somewhere in the middle
Wondering why nobody stays
You are a child of wild desires
When your innocence leaves, yeah
Why you want to play with fire
Here I am
Here I am

Je m'appelle la Flamme
(Ça c'est mon nom)
Oh
Set off your alarm
(Oooh, ce soir)
Let me take you home
Bet you I'll take care of everything
Tonight

(What what what
What you gonna do for me)

You thought her love was too good
But she's the reason for your pain
But hey, I'm gonna make you happy
I'll never let you hurt again
Almost killed you with her honesty
Back when you innocently stayed
Why you want to play with fire
Here I am
Here I am

Je m'appelle la Flamme
(Ça c'est mon nom)
Oh
Set off your alarm
(Oooh, ce soir)
Let me take you home
Bet you I'll take care of everything
Tonight
(La Flamme)
Je m'appelle la Flamme
(Ça c'est mon nom)
Oh
Set off your alarm
(Oooh, ce soir)
Let me take you home
Bet you I'll take care of everything
Tonight

(Tonight)
Make the magic for real
Make your fantasies happen completely
Come stay with me
Stay with me

Je m'appelle la Flamme
(Ça c'est mon nom)
Oh
Set off your alarm
(Oooh, ce soir)
Let me take you home
Bet you I'll take care of everything
Bet you I'll take care of everything
(Tonight)
Je m'appelle la Flamme
(Ça c'est mon nom)
Oh
Set off your alarm
Let me take you home
Bet you I'll take care of everything
(Tonight)
Je m'appelle la Flamme
Mon nom est Chaka Khan
(Ça c'est mon nom)
Let me take you home
Bet you I'll
I'll take care of everything.
