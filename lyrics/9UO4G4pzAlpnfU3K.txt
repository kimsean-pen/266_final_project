Mr. what-ya-call-em what you doin tonight
Hope you're in the mood because i'm feeling just right
How's about a corner with a table for two
Where the music's mellow in some gay rendezvous
There's no chance romancin' with a blue attitude
You got to do some dancin' to get in the mood
Sister what-ya-call-em that's a kindly idea
Something swing-a-dilla would be good to my ear
Ev'rybody must agree the dancin' has charm
When you have the certain one you love in your arms
Steppin' out with you will be a sweet interlude
A builder-up with that will put me in the mood
In the mood - that's it i got it
In the mood - your ear will spot it
In the mood - oh what a hot hit
Be alive and get the jive
You've got to learn how
Hep, hep, hep - hep like a hepper
Pep, pep, pep - hot as a pepper
Step, step, step - step like a stepper
We're muggin' and huggin'
We're in the mood now
Mr. what-ya-call-em all you needed was fun
You can see the wonders that this evenin' has done
Your feet were so heavy 'til they hardly could move
Now they're light as feathers and you're right in the groove
You were only hungry for some musical food
You're positively, absolutely in the mood
Sister what-ya-call-em i'm indebted to you
It all goes to show what food and fluids can do
Never felt so happy and so fully alive
Seems that jammin' jumpin' is a powerful jive
Swingeroo is giving me a new attitude
My heart is full of rhythm and i'm in the mood
In the mood that's it 'cause i got it and i'm
In the mood your ear will spot it when you're
In the mood bobbity bop a diddly-bop-a-bop-a
Be alive and get the jive
You've got to learn how
Hep, hep, hep, you're hep like a hepper full of
Pep, pep, pep, you're hot as a pepper and you
Step, step, step, step step like a stepper
We're muggin' and now we're huggin'
'cause we're in the mood
