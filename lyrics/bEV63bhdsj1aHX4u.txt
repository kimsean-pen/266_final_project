Back in bendings
I'm easily amused
Back stop calling
We're running out of room

Mouth in sharp pen
Little grooves on display
But I'm still waiting
For something nice to say

Mean spirits are high
Mean spirits high

Please go on and on
This beauty and your venom
I love to play and sing along
I love to play and sing along

Too late to decide
My lips are open wide
I love to play and sing along
I love to play and sing along

You stare at my shoulders
Are you surprised to see?
One more tempo
The angel you should be

Mean spirits are high
Mean spirits high

Please go on and on
This beauty and your venom
I love to play and sing along
I love to play and sing along

Too late to decide
My lips are open wide
I love to play and sing along
I love to play and sing along

High, high...

Please keep going on
Oh my sweet venom
I love to play and sing along
I love to play and sing along

Too late to decide
My lips are open wide
I love to play and sing along
I love to play and sing along
