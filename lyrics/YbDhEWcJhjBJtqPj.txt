Don't you be wastin' all your money
On syrup and honey because I'm sweet enough
Don't you be usin' every minute on makin' a livin'
Because we got our love

Listen to me 1, 2, 3
Baby, baby, baby
Spend your time on me

Don't you be out all night long leavin' me all alone
Because I, I need your love
Don't you be spendin' every day workin' away
Because I'm waitin' for you

Listen to me 1, 2, 3
Baby, baby, baby
Spend your time on me

Spend it, spend it, spend it
Your time on me
Please baby, please baby
