There comes a time
A time in everyones life
Where nothing seems to go your way
Where nothing seems to turn out right

There may come a time
You just can't seem to find your place
For every door you open
Seems like you get two slammed in your face

Thats when you need someone
Someone that you you can call when all your faith is gone
It feels like you can't go on
Let it be me
Let it be me
If it's a friend that you need
Let it be me
Let it be me
Feels like your always coming up last

Pockets full of nothin aint got no cash
No matter where you turn, you aint got no place to stand
you Reach out for something and they slap your hand
I remember all too well

Just how it feels to be all alone
You feel like youd give anything
For just a little place you can call your own
Thats when you need someone

Someone that you you can call
When all your faith is gone
Feels like you can't go on
Let it be me
Let it be me
If it's a friend you need
Let it be me
Let it be me
Let it be me
Let it be me
If it's a friend you need
Let it be me
Let it be me
Let it be me
