I've been let loose and now I'm crawling up the walls
Word is I got away and now I must be caught
Don't leave
Take it from me
I'll be more than a king

(I can't take that, I can't take that)
I'm going crazy and I've been awake for days
My mirrors are stained with painted portraits of your face
Don't leave
Take it from me
You're my dirty disease

(I can't take that, I can't take that)
My flat line inhibition
Is my ammunition
I'm just fighting to get by
Just spit me some direction
I'll be your infection
How could you leave me behind?

I'm a mess and you're worse
Just give me time to give you a waste of time
One of those nights
When you leave me for no reason
I'll give you a reason

If seconds heal all wounds
I'll put these tips on you

I brought apologies wrapped tight in a bouquet
Just to find out that my face had been replaced
Deceived
It was a breeze
I was tossed to the streets

(I can't take that, I can't take that)
My flat line inhibition
Is my ammunition
I'm just fighting to get by
Just spit me some direction
I'll be your infection
How could you leave me behind?

I'm a mess and you're worse
Just give me time to give you a waste of time
One of those nights
When you leave me for no reason
I'll give you a reason

I'm a mess and you're worse
Just give me time to give you a waste of time
One of those nights
When you leave me for no reason
I'll give you a reason

If seconds heal all wounds
I'll put these tips on you
When faith is left to prove
It's all you have to lose

I'm a mess and you're worse
Just give me time to give you a waste of time
One of those nights
When you leave me for no reason
I'll give you a reason

I'm a mess and you're worse
Just give me time to give you a waste of time
One of those nights
When you leave me for no reason
I'll give you a reason
