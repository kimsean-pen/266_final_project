Stick like toffee, sip like coffee
Wake up, change your mind and drop me
Love to hate me
Crazy, shady
Spit me out like hot wasabi
Lick me up
I'm sweet and salty
Mix it up and down my body
Love to hate me
Praise me, shame me
Either way you talk about me

Oh-oh, I love the way you talk about me
Oh-oh, look at how far it got me
Oh-oh, the shit the papers write about me
Oh-oh, I fold it up like origami
Oh-oh, like she ain't wearing no clothes
Oh-oh, when she goin' solo
Oh-oh, I bet they gonna break up
Oh-oh, but what the hell do you know?

Ooh, baby, ooh, yes you
I can feel you hatin' on me
Ooh, baby, ooh, yeah you
I'm glad to be your inspiration
Who, baby, who's, guess who?
The topic of your conversation, I am (I am)
All the ugly things you say
Come and say 'em to my face

Stick like toffee, sip like coffee
Wake up, change your mind and drop me
Love to hate me
Crazy, shady
Spit me out like hot wasabi
Lick me up
I'm sweet and salty
Mix it up and down my body
Love to hate me
Praise me, shame me
Either way you talk about me

Oh-oh, watching me
Oh-oh, I ain't watching you (watching you)
Oh-oh, what you see
Oh-oh, I hope you like the view
Oh-oh, best believe
Oh-oh, you'll never get into me,
all these words run through me (oh-oh, oh-oh)

Ooh, baby, ooh, yes you
I can feel you hatin' on me
Ooh, baby, ooh, yeah you
I'm glad to be your inspiration
Who, baby, who's, guess who?
The topic of your conversation, I am (I am)
All the ugly things you say
Come and say 'em to my face

Stick like toffee, sip like coffee
Wake up, change your mind and drop me
Love to hate me
Crazy, shady
Spit me out like hot wasabi
Lick me up
I'm sweet and salty
Mix it up and down my body
Love to hate me
Praise me, shame me
Either way you talk about me

You know I love the way you talk about me
Look at how far it got me
You wake up shit to write about me
I fold it up like origami
Like she ain't wearing no clothes
When she goin' solo
I bet they gonna break up
But what the hell do you know?
