Blood marks the trail
Red paints the horizon
Hunters moon embraced with howling forlorn

Daybreak revealed the marks
Traces of a wounded leader
Rules the lands from these woods and beyond

Race through the woods
Hasten over the waters
Run upon the frozen lakes

Reach a higher ground
That reveals the realm
Under your might
White kingdom of frost and ice

Ruler of the frozen lands from these woods and beyond
Embrace the hunters moon with howling forlorn
