Reach out and touch faith

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers, someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers, someone who's there

Feeling unknown and you're all alone
Flesh and bone by the telephone
Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer

Take second best, put me to the test
Things on your chest, we need to confess
I will deliver, you know I'm a forgiver

Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers, someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers, someone who's there

Reach out and touch faith

Feeling unknown and you're all alone
Flesh and bone by the telephone
Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer
I will deliver, you know I'm a forgiver
