Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

What a cheek
Undertaking anyone at 70
What a laugh
Splashing through the gravel as you barrel past
Saints above
Popping on the poppers of your driving glove, glove
Jelly Bean
Air freshener swinging in your window screen

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Speaker phone
Speaking very, very loudly on your speaker phone
What a day
Everything is lovely on the motorway
But I, I was hoping for a change of heart
I, I was looking for a little direction

Sunlight splashes of the bonnet
On the M5
No one else is on it
It's an open wide motorway
Sunlight splashes of the bonnet
On the M5
No one else is on it
It's an open wide motorway

Cruise control
Spend the extra money on your cruise control
What a treat
Stretching in your butter leather bucket seat
I, I was hoping for a change of heart
I, I was looking for a little direction

Sunlight splashes of the bonnet
On the M5
No one else is on it
It's an open wide motorway
Sunlight splashes of the bonnet
On the M5
No one else is on it
It's an open wide motorway

He's on for a personal best when someone outside of Aldershot,
he fails to notice a mini roundabout. Then his steering goes light,
and as he soars beyond the central reservation going up and up and
up, he sees his shoelaces are
undone. It's funny the things you notice

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Sunlight splashes of the bonnet
On the M5
No one else is on it
It's an open wide motorway
