Find me out walkin'
Time the whistle start a-callin'
Maybe stoppin' early
Knockin' at your door
Take so long to answer
Lord knows, it ain't the milkman
Could be stoppin' early
Sellin' door to door

Here's my latest sample
I can show you how to use it
First, you pull the curtain
While I spread some here
Wipe the surface gently
Try to use a circle motion
Safe for all your problems
And my price is fair

This stuff'll get the stain out
If you use it loosely wadded
This here'll take the pain out
And won't mess your hair
Place your order early
'Cause you know I'm in a hurry
Your neighbor's in her doorway
Won't you sign right here?

Place your order early
'Cause you know I'm in a hurry
Your neighbor's in her doorway
Won't you sign right here?

The man is on the last train
All that work and no play
Could be stoppin' early
Knockin' at your door
Time for me to head on
Pack my kit and "So long"
Catch you bright and early
Sellin' door to door

This stuff'll get the stain out
If you use it loosely wadded
This here'll take the pain out
And won't mess your hair
Place your order early
'Cause you know I'm in a hurry
Your neighbor's in her doorway
Won't you sign right here?

Place your order early
'Cause you know I'm in a hurry
Your neighbor's in her doorway
Won't you sign right here?

Place your order early
You know I'm in a hurry
Your neighbor's in her doorway
Won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you?

Place your order early
'Cause you know I'm in a hurry
Your neighbor's in her doorway
Won't you? C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
