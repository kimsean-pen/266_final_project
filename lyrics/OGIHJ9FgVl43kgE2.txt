There's a shop down the street
where they sell plastic rings
for a quarter a piece, I swear it.
Yeah, I know that it's cheap
not like gold in your dreams
but I hope that you'll still wear it.
Yeah, the ink may stain my skin
and my jeans may all be ripped.
I'm not perfect, but I swear
I'm perfect for you.
And there's no guarantee
that this will be easy.
It's not a miracle you need, believe me.
Yeah, I'm no angel, I'm just me
but I will love you endlessly.
Wings aren't what you need, you need me.
There's a house on the hill
with a view of the town
and I know how you adore it.
So I'll work everyday
through the sun, and the rain
until I can afford it.
Yeah, your friends may think I'm crazy
cause they can only see
I'm not perfect, but I swear, I'm perfect for you.
And there's no guarantee
that this will be easy.
It's not a miracle you need, believe me.
Yeah, I'm no angel, I'm just me
but I will love you endlessly.
Wings aren't what you need, you need me.
(You need me, I know you need me
you need me, I know you need me)
Ink may stain my skin
and my jeans may all be ripped.
I'm not perfect, but I swear
I'm perfect for you.
And there's no guarantee
that this will be easy. (This will be easy)
It's not a miracle you need, believe me. (Won't you believe me?)
Yeah, I'm no angel, I'm just me
but I will love you endlessly.
Wings aren't what you need, you need me. (You know you need me)
(I know you need me)
You need me
(I know you need me)
You need me
(I know you need me)
