It's easy to feel like
Your all alone
To feel like nobody knows
The great that you are
The good that's inside you
Is trying so hard to break through
Maybe it's your time to lift off and fly
You wont know if you never try
I will be there with you all of the way
You'll be fine

Don't let anyone tell you that you're not strong enough
Don't give up there's nothing wrong with just beign yourelf
That's more than enough
So come on and raise your voice
Speakin bout it make some noise
And sing Hey Hey Make Some noise
Hey hey yeah

You want to be known
You want to be heard
And no you are beautiful
You have so much to give
Some change you wanna live
So shout it out and let it show
You have a diamond inside of your heart
A light that shines bright as the stars
Don't be afraid to be all that you are
You'll Be fine

Don't let anyone tell you that you're not strong enough
Don't give up there's nothing wrong with just beign yourelf
That's more than enough
So come on and raise your voice
Speakin bout it make some noise
And sing Hey Hey Make Some noise
Hey hey yeah

You can't just sit back and watch the world change
Matters What you got to say
There's no one else who can stand in your place
So come on it's never too late

Maybe it's your time to lift off and fly
You wont know if you never try (try, try)

Don't let anyone tell you that you're not strong enough
Don't give up there's nothing wrong with just beign yourelf
That's more than enough
So come on and raise your voice
Speakin bout it make some noise
And sing Hey Hey Make Some noise
Hey hey yeah
Hey Hey Make Some Noise
Speakin bout it make some noise (Hey, Hey)
And sing Hey Yeah Hey Yeah Hey Yeah
Make Some Noise
Hey Yeah Hey yeah Hey Yeah (Make Some Noise) Make Some Noise
Hey Yeah Hey yeah Hey Yeah (Make Some Noise) Make Some Noise
Hey Yeah Hey yeah Hey Yeah (Make Some Noise) Make Some Noise
