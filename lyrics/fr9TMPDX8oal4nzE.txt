its alright i know
there's no place to go
put gas on the fire
cause i like it that way

things all seem the same
nothing seems to change
turn on my friends
until none remain

ramble on, on and on
back to the where shadow's gone
oh yeah oh yeah
ramble on, on and on
back to when my life ain't wrong
oh yeah oh yeah

we're all lost at sea
and'll soon cease to be
i love the way
that you shut me out

you just seems so tired
why not rest awhile?
just shut your eyes
and i'll gouge them out

ramble on, on and on
back to the where shadow's gone
oh yeah oh yeah
ramble on, on and on
back to when my life ain't wrong
oh yeah oh yeah
