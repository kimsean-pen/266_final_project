Well I've been thinking
That I've been running in circles again
And I've been hiding indoors
God damn
My skin it don't take too well to them
Keep me from coming down
Fooled enough to feel anything different now
Fooled enough to feel, to feel, to feel
Cause I've been frozen down to my teeth
Come on and warm this dead misery
And I've been listening to every word spoken inside and underneath
Behind the breath that you can see
Keep me from coming down
Fooled enough to feel anything different now
Fooled enough to feel, to feel, to feel
Keep me from coming down
Fooled enough to feel anything different now
Fooled enough to feel, to feel, to feel
