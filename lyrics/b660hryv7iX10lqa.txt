You know your mama and your daddy sayin' I'm no good for you

They call me dirty from the alley 'til I don't know what to do.
I get so tired of sneakin' around just to get to your back door

I crawled past the garbage and your mama jumped out screamin':
Don't come back no more
I can't take it!

My guitar wants to kill your mama

My guitar wants to kill your mama

My guitar wants to burn your dad

I get real mean when it makes me mad.

Later I tried to call you
your mama told me you weren't there.
She told me don't bother to call again unless I cut off all my hair.
I get so tired of sneakin' around just to get to your back door

I crawled past the garbage and your mam jumped out screamin':
Don't come back no more
I can't take it!

Later I tried to call you
