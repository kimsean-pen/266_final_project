I sent my song too soon
You didn't free me at all
And I barely made it here
You're driving through the towns
And you start to missing me
Through Tennessee

I had it all wrong
I was about to believe
That I could fall for you
And you had eyes for me
You've got it all wrong
I was about to believe
That you had desire for me
That you had desire for me

You've got no lights on your face
Mine are mapping out
The sparks where we laid
Not coming to see you in a??
As you cross LA

I had it all wrong
Was about to believe
That I could fall for you
You had eyes for me
You've got it all wrong
I was about to believe
That you had strong eyes for me
That you had desire for me

I had it all wrong
Was about to believe
That you had desire for me
