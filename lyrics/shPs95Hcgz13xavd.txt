I took off from paradise
I landed in the jungle
I've spent the whole time lost in the clouds

I've lost my body in the summer storm
Somewhere over the ocean
I think my mind may also be gone

Something more than a steady hand
Is what I need to apparel
Just to level it out and make a new plan

Seems to me just to fall apart
To trembling cold
So I pray my eyes and ears will be last
"My flow's to"

See nobody go anymore

I'm gonna start to bleed on the floor

"My flow's to"
"My flow's to"

"MY flow's to"
"Flow's to"
I took off in the paradise

I landed in the jungle
I spent the whole time watching my back
I see you coming in the monsoon
Somewhere over the ocean

And I swear it means more now that I'm done
"Flow's to"

See nobody go anymore
I'm gonna start to bleed on the floor

So flow's to be strong gone girl
I see my body go
Flow's on
Flow's to
Flow's to
Flow's to
Flow's to
Flow's to
Flow's to
