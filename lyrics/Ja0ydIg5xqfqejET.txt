I know exactly how you feel
You can hear what they think
Like a shadow in the dark
Are you even real

They will bring you down
But weakness makes them win
You have to realize
You're stronger than you think

Cause once that you've seen
What's on the other side
You have to believe
You can win this fight

If you think we're human
Take a look once again
If you think we're human
Where's the heart when we just look away
If you think we're human
You should think once again
If you think we're human
Look at us, it's time to make a change
And the question remains

About the world and why we're here
What's the purpose of this pain
You might feel powerless at times
Go on and make it disappear

'Cause every time you feel weak
Say you're stronger than fear
But you have to believe
We're gonna make it there

If you think we're human
Take a look once again
If you think we're human
Where's the heart when we just look away
If you think we're human
You should think once again
If you think we're human
Look at us, it's time to make a change
And the question remains
Are we human
Are we human
Who are human
Who are human
Are we human
Are we human

Look at us, it's time to make a change
Look at us, it's time to make a change

If you think we're human
Take a look once again
If you think we're human
Where's the heart when we just look away
If you think we're human
You should think once again
If you think we're human
Look at us, it's time to make a change
And the question remains

Are we human
Are we human
Who are human
Who are human
Are we human
Are we human

Look at us, it's time to make a change
