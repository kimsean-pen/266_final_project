Is there anybody out there looking for a party?
Shake your money maker, baby, smoke it if you got it
We just wanna have some fun, if you don't wanna kiss this
Everybody raise your hands, come on, I need a witness

We got it going on
We'll be banging and singing just like the Rolling Stones
We're gonna shake up your souls, we've come to rattle your bones
'Cause we got it going on
Hey, yeah

You got a ticket to kick it, I wanna hear you scream now
Because tonight, you got the right to let your hair down
Well, everybody's getting down, we're getting down to business
Can't say freak train, you don't wanna miss this

We got it going on
We'll be banging and singing just like the Rolling Stones
We're gonna shake up your souls, we've come to rattle your bones
'Cause we got it going on
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah

And now, a public service announcement for my country cousin
Big Kenny, talk to the people
Brothers and sisters, we're here to come together as one
And love everybody
Can I get a 'Amen' now?

We got it going on, we got it going on, we got it going on
We'll be banging and singing just like the Rolling Stones
We're gonna shake up your souls, we've come to rattle your bones
We got it going on

Getting down with Big and Rich and Richie and Jon
Just banging and singing, why don't you hop on along?
'Cause we got it going on
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
We got it, we got it, we got it going on
We got it, we got it, we got it going on
