My motivation is gone too soon
Good vibrations all over you
Act like you mean it
You mean it
You gotta story you never tell
Down in the Delta, I'm ringing bells
I've never seen it
Seen it
Back of my mind, I'm on my way

I see through smiles on every face
I don't believe it, believe it

'Cause I'm the supersoaker, red white and blew 'em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away
The flags are flying across the Plains
I got a secret picking in my brain
I wanna see you
See you
the exit sign is on my face

don't know my home
I don't know my place

I just wanna be there, be there
'Cause I'm the supersoaker, red white and blew 'em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say
I don't mind sentimental girls at times

Miss don't walk away, walk away
I don't mind sentimental girls at times

Miss don't walk away, whoa oh oh
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
I just lay it on the line
On the line
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, oh oh oh oh
