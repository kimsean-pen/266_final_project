You were borrowed, I was blue
I was old and you were new
I mistook my death for bliss
And if that ain't love then it don't exist
Then it don't exist
Then it don't exist

Five AM, I'm still awake
Harping on that faithful day
That I kissed your lips and knew I'd die
And If that ain't love then love's a lie
Then love's a lie
Then love's a lie

The sky's not gonna fall
Well, maybe it will
And even though you never call, I hear you still
And, even if the papers say to stay inside all day
I'll take my chances with the rain
With the rain

You said "bye, " I said "okay
I'll wait around while you're away"
And I always knew it'd come to this
And if that ain't love then nothing is
Then nothing is
Then nothing is

The sky's not gonna fall
Well, maybe it will
And even though you never call, I hear you still
And even if the papers say to stay inside all day
I'll take my chances with the rain
With the rain

The sky's not gonna fall
Well, maybe it will
And even though you never call, I hear you still
Even if the papers say to stay inside all day
I'll take my chances with the rain
Oh, with the rain
Oh, with the rain
