Hateful I'm slashing, the head is removed
Removing the head of the corpse
The throat down the hard chest the trunk is torn
Tearing the trunk of the corpse

Disintegrating the stiff limb by limb
Performing deviant(?) butchery
I chop up the limbs into small handy chunks
In my own way of sick butchery

I rip out the entrails, cut into flesh
Into the torso I grasp - deep - to tear out the rest
I divide into that which I like and which not
Nutritious organs stored, the rest left to rot

Wrathful I'm hacking the organs are minced
Mincing the flesh of the stiff
Imagine the bodyparts served on a plate
Prepared by sick culinary

(?) ...culinary hypervisty
