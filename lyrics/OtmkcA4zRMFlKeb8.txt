Disappointment condition
A perfunctory prescription
Of an indigent mindset
A belligerent silence
We got all we need
Turning out of a tin can
Thinking about the remend
Of the social hurt
Listen to the noise
On the battery tape deck
A Judas trainwreck
Anonymous suspect
Hovering in carbon monoxide cremations
Loners waste away inside
Of vacant locations
Think tanks empty
International dream bank
Plug in my reactor
To the fallout zone
The enemies' story is a lot like mine
And if you get to the point
Then you are better than I

Dark star
Vacant eyelids closing
Cities grew themselves
From a sky lit terrain

Autopilot drivers
Riding out on the ice age
Infidels swallowed
In a vanishing point
Ammunition souls shooting
Holes in the ozone
Widows tears
Washing a soldier's bones
Sterilized egos
Delirium sequels
Punctured by the arrows
Of American eagle Robot teach you about the rules that belead you
Backspace my brain
My equilibrium goes

Dark star
Just an eye that's closing
Cities grew themselves
From a sky lit terrain

One, two
One, two
