(You blew me away)
Rough night, was it?
Oh, sorry I'm late
(You took your time)
(Oh, patience is a lovely game)

Last night, oh-oh-oh, you blew me away
But you took your time
Oh, patience is a lovely game
I found out that you loved it when I lay
Told you what to do and you listened to me when I say
I blew you away the second that I cried
Told you I adored

Last night, ooh yeah, you totally blew me away
But you took your time, oh-oh-oh
I love the way you play
Tell me what to do
Baby, are you true?
I pray I am not pulling all the weight down
Told you I adore...

Last night, oh-oh-oh, you blew me away
You took your time, oh-oh-oh
You blew me to pieces
