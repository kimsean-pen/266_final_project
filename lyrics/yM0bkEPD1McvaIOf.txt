I plot
Your rubric scarab
I steal
Your satellite
I want
Your wife to be my
Baby tonight, baby tonight

I choose to steal what you chose to show
And you know
I will not apologize
You're mine for the taking

I'm making a career of evil
I'm making a career of evil
I'm making a career of evil
I'm making a career of evil

Pay me
I'll be your surgeon
I'd like
To pick your brain
Capture
You inject you
Leave you kneeling in the rain
Kneeling in the rain

I choose to steal what you chose to show
And you know
I will not apologize
You're mine for the taking

I'm making a career of evil
I'm making a career of evil
I'm making a career of evil
I'm making a career of evil
(Ee-ee-ee-ee-)

I'd like your blue eyed horseshoe
I'd like your emerald horny toad
I'd like to do it to your daughter on a dirt road

And then I'd spend
Your ransom money
But still
I'd keep your sheep
I'd peel
The mask you're wearing
And then rob you of your sleep
Rob you of your sleep

I choose to steal what you chose to show
And you know
I will not apologize
You're mine for the taking

I'm making a career of evil
I'm making a career of evil
I'm making a career of evil
I'm making a career of evil

(I'm making a career of evil)
(I'm making a career of evil)
(I'm making a career of evil)
(I'm making a career of evil)
