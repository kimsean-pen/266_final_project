Making love in the rain,
i can't believe the joy it brings me.
Making love all alone,
i hear the rain on my window.
It's just a little thing,
but it means so much to me.
Our bodies together,
while the rain plays a melody.
Every raindrop makes think of you.
(wishing you were close to me)
There is nothing that i'd rather do than...
making love in the rain,
i can't believe the joy it brings me.
When we're done - all alone,
i hear the rain on my window.
When it's stormy outside,
it's warm in my heart,
with you in my arms.
And when your away from me,
i wish it would rain,
'cause its always the same
Every raindrop makes think of you.
(wishing you were close to me)
There is nothing that i'd rather do than...
making love in the rain,
i can't believe the joy it brings me.
(i can't believe)
When i'm here all alone,
i hear the rain on my window.
(on my window)
Making love in the rain,
i can't believe the joy it brings me.
Making love all alone,
i hear the rain on my window.
(on my window, i hear the raindrops fall)
Every raindrop makes think of you.
(wishing you were close to me)
There is nothing that i'd rather do than...
(nothing that i'd rather do than)
making love in the rain,
i can't believe the joy it brings me.
(making love. oohh making love)

when we're here all alone,
i hear the rain on my window.
(on my window, i hear it rain)
Making love in the rain,
i can't believe the joy it brings me
(ooohhhh, yeah)
All alone i hear the rain.
(i hear the rain)
My love here comes the rain.
My love here comes the rain.
My love here comes the rain.
My love here comes the rain.
