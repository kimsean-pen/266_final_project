Descending the cold steps of the institution for the politically insane
Never to be seen again
Saying farewell to daylight
From henceforth I shall rot in stinking bed of wet straw

Right from the ashes of life...
I learned to behave
What to believe
What not to say
From cradle to grave

Ah...
Like a good little slave!
Sucking my milk
From the venomous tit of the state!
Clearly designed to suppress every thought of escape

Ah...
I surrunder to fate!
No pity... No pity!
Don't want no pity for me in this filthy cell
I'll see you in hell... see you in hell!

Frozen in time, I'm a specimen pinned to my throne
With an army of butterflies pilloried placid and prone

Ah...
We were never alone!
No pity! No pity! Don't want no pity for me in this filthy cell
I'll see you in hell...

After centuries of living with nothing but my convictions
Broken fingers clawing through the walls of my incarceration
Escaping the clutches of eternal damnation
I was justified...
