We all know there's something wrong and we've known it all along
Sincerity
You may think there's no one else 'til they put you on a shelf
Society
Pay your taxes stand in line help them plan for your demise
Society
Crush the weak to get your share 'cause nobody's playing fair

How long you pray makes no difference today
When your Society devises how you'll pay
When finding the truth makes no difference to you
Anyway you look at it you're gone get screwed
You lose
(That's right!)
Society
No one here can get along cause our history's too long
Sincerity
Think you're going with the flow but you never really know
Society

How long you pray makes no difference today
When your Society devises how you'll pay
When finding the truth makes no difference to you
Anyway you look at it you're gone get screwed
You lose

Yeah!
Society
We all know there's something wrong and we've known it all along
Sincerity

Society
Think you're going with the flow but you never really know
Society
Data patterns are supplied proof tap back up all the lies
