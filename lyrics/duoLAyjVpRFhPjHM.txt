you turn me down
inside my ryde
Turnpike road
Is the most Exciting

You give me rise
To a bad mood
According to this
Invisible contract

You ridin' with supernova
A perfect place is lowa
Mixin it Up in a Chroma

Go right ahead
Throw the brickbat
To what she said
What's the row about that

You ridin' with supernova
A perfect place is lowa
Mixin it up in a Chroma
