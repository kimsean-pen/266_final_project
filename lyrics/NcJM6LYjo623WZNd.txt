No compromise as I fight to break the cycle
And bring an end to this suffering
I'm a shadow, a black out, a storm in the background
One man's whisper is another's scream

Searching between all the lines

Forsaken, I walk the night alone
No sanctuary
No place for me to call my home
But it's time to break the cycle
Go

Nothing in mind can replace where I have come from
Can someone tell me who the fuck I am?
Now I'm on my knees, try to drain this disease
Repair this machine with unsteady hands

Searching for truth in the knife

Forsaken, I walk the night alone
No sanctuary
No place for me to call my home
But it's time to break the cycle

I've been the prey of my own mind
With records later, still confined

Now I've become my own device
Of malice and of contemplation
To go back to expired time
I'll break through the silence and leave it behind

And I'm lost on the stage I've spent
Isolating from nameless faces
Reliving the same dead end
Break through the cycle I swore to condemn

Forsaken, I walk the night alone
No sanctuary
No place for me to call my home
But it's time to break the cycle

The past is haunting me
Let go and set me free
Open the door to the unknown
