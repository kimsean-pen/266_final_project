I have a knife in my heart I could never explain
Cloned from a killer, I crawled out the drain
Done from the start, there's a short in my brain
To some it may hurt but to me it's just pain

Ooh, regret it? Ooh, never
Ooh, forget it, this ain't a game
Ooh, ain't gonna talk it, ooh, I ain't ashamed
Ooh, I'm gonna walk it, I'll never be tamed

Open windows, closing doors
God can't help us anymore
Souls forever come and go
Burn all the bridges there's fire in the hole

Ugly I can be, what you know about me
I'm a pirate and a thief and you'll never fuckin' see
There comes a point in time, put it all out on the line
I'm gonna get mine, I've come to take mine

Ooh, regret it? Ooh, never
Ooh, forget it, this ain't a game
Ooh, ain't gonna talk it, ooh, I ain't ashamed
Ooh, I'm gonna walk it, I'll never be tamed

Open windows, closing doors
God can't help us anymore
Souls forever come and go
Burn all the bridges there's fire in the hole
Burn all the bridges there's fire in the hole

You live, die - that's life
You live, die - that's life

Open windows, closing doors
God can't help us anymore
Souls forever come and go
Open windows, closing doors
God can't help us anymore
Souls forever come and go
Burn all the bridges there's fire in the hole
Burn all the bridges there's fire in the hole
