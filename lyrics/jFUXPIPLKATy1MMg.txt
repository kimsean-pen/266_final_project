Yeah, yeah, uh

Just used my last one percent to text you, that shit wasn't worth it
LAX to JFK, I probably miss on purpose
Funny how when I don't care, these feelings all resurface
2016 was catastrophic, I deserved it
Just thankful that it's over
Just grateful that it's through

She got a runny nose
I don't think that it's the flu
I got a table at the Nice Guy
Got a bottle of The Spades
You and your girls drank all my liquor
And y'all ain't even say thanks, hoe

I would wish you the best, but you already had it
You already had it, baby
I wish you the best, but you already
Uh, you already had it, babe
(Ohh, ohh)

Uh, lately I been feelin' so dead in my own skin
And it's a problem, I admit it
When I look into the mirror, that ain't me, that's someone different
Reminiscin', had a vision
Gettin' married, havin' kids
And let's be honest
Only thing I'm raisin' is these fuckin' digits, so

And all these rumors that you bitches start
Are probably true, I did it
Feedin' lines of blow to models, off a mirror in the kitchen
It's ironic and specific
Can't say they never saw themselves
Startin' up problems with addiction, oh

I would wish you the best, but you already had it
You already had it, baby
I wish you the best, but you already
Uh, you already had it, babe
Uh, you already had it, babe
Uh, you already had it, babe
