How can I make money when I don't care about money?
How can I say something if I'm thinking about something else?
How can I change something if it just amounts to nothing?
How did I make something out of nothing at all?

Feels like the first time, feels like the first time
I'm holding on to a thread, or a blurred line
Watching the birds fly, swallow my words
I'm gone, show you my worst side

I care about it, I care about it
I saw you smiling, I care about it
A curse of violence, my world is silent
I keep it silent, I keep the title
I creep in silence, I feel divided
I grieve in silence, I feel divided
I saw you smiling, I care about it
I care about it, I care about it
