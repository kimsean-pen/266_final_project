I'm going down
Into a wild wild territory
(Wild wild territory)
Where all the trees are centenary
(Trees are centenary)
I went too far to give up now
(To give up to give up now)
I am a few steps away from paradise
(Ouuuuh)
I'm going down
Into a green green sanctuary
(Green green sanctuary)
I hear holly voices calling me
(Ouuuuh)
I went too far to slow down
(To slow down)
I am a few steps away from paradise
(Ouuuuh)

Trippin'
I'm trippin'
I'm trippin'
I'm trippin'
I'm trippin'
All of a sudden
Who pushed the button?
Trippin'
I'm trippin'
I'm trippin'
I'm trippin'
I'm trippin'
All of a sudden
Who pushed the button?

Once again...

I'm going down
Into a wild wild territory
(Wild wild territory)
I hear a distant symphony

I went too far to turn my back
(To turn to turn my back)
I'm a few steps away from paradise
I went too far to slow down
(To slow down)
I am a few steps away from paradise
(Ouuuuh)

I'm trippin'
Trippin'
I'm trippin'
I'm trippin'
All of a sudden
Who pushed the button?
Trippin'
I'm trippin'
I'm trippin'
I'm trippin'
Let's go higher
I'm trippin'
All of a sudden
Who pushed the button?

Let's go higher...
