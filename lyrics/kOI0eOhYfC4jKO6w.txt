I've got a confession
I've got a secret
On the tip of my tongue and it's bleeding out
You know I've got my reasons
This suffocating feeling
And the voice in my head is bleeding out

And I don't think that I'll ever really change
This is not how I'm made

'Cause I think I've lost half my mind
Fighting my addiction
I've been killing, wasting time
I'm not alright
And I can do it if I want to
I can do it if I want to
I don't care if it hurts me
I care if I hurt you
I care if I hurt you

Blinded by these white lines
Feeling like I'm divine
Never reaching cloud nine
And I feel like giving up
Enough's never enough
I divorced all my love
Why won't you give up?
Why won't you give up?

'Cause I don't think that I'll ever really change
This is not how I'm made

'Cause I think I've lost half my mind
Fighting my addiction
I've been killing, wasting time
I'm not alright
And I can do it if I want to
I can do it if I want to
I don't care if it hurts me
I care if I hurt you

I need help
I've gotten myself lost again
I can't do it on my own
I don't know what to do
Please don't go
Just help me
I can't do this on my own

Stay
Stay with me
Stay
Stay with me

I think I've lost half my mind
Fighting my addictions
I've been chasing the white light
I'm not, I'm not alright.
And I can do it if I want to
You know I'll do it if I want to
'Cause I don't care if it hurts me
I care if I hurt you
With my white lines
And my white lies
My white lines
My white lies
