Dengue woman
Stay away from me
Dengue woman
Stay away from me
You got your fever and you rush
Over me

That's why
Everyday you bring me misery
Everyday you give me misery
I think about jumpin'
Jumpin' in the deep blue see

You got me all crazy
I can't get outta bed
Bones are achin'
(?) in my head
Dengue woman
Stay away from me
I've got your aches and things
Over me
