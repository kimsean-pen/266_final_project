And look real close,
Across the lines and the roads,
It is there to decode...
Where you thought was a ghost,
Are sparked to explode
It's the start of the show
It's the part you love most
When your heart will implode within

Do you believe in hallucinations?
Silly dreams or Imagination?
Don't go away 'cause I feel you this time
Don't go away 'cause I need you here this time

As a man floats home,
Carry us, back to shore,
And let the mountainous coast,
Where the sun starts to glow,
From our head to our toes,
To the stars, that we know,
And with you as my host,
It will keep us afloat, we can

Do you believe in hallucinations?
Silly dreams or Imagination?
Don't go away 'cause I feel you this time
Don't go away 'cause I need you here this time.

Do you believe in hallucinations,
Any dream or it's revelation?
Don't go away 'cause I need you here this time,
Don't go away cause I'll leave you here all night

The signs, are taxing,
I'm waiting, for something,
There's images of love and war
And everything's here to explore,
It's all unlike, the usual,
A different place but beautiful,
And it is not quite as it seems,
I hear the children's laughs and screams,

Ohhhh, It's beautiful!

Ohhhh, So beautiful!

Ohhhh, It's beautiful!

Ohhhhh!

Do you believe in hallucinations?
Silly dreams or Imagination?
Don't go away 'cause I feel you this time
Don't go away 'cause I need you here this time

Do you believe in hallucinations,
Any dream or it's revelation?
Don't go away 'cause I need you here this time,
Don't go away cause I'll leave you here all night
I'm making you, all mine,
I'm making you, all mine
