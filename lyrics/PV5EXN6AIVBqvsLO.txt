In the dark I live
Without any freedom in life
Those darkened shadows do not deceive
They are all I see and know
This cave is all I breathe
In chains 'til the day that you die
This crimson fire burns at my back
Like waves of nothing it flows
One can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark
But one cannot forgive a man who is afraid of the light
Gods. Blind. Death. Chains. Dark. Bravery.
War versus peace
Ignorance versus strength
Freedom versus slavery
The dreamer must awake

لا إله إلا الله
There is no god except Allah
La illaha illallah
Within a dream, I cannot forsake
All hope has flown away
This dark shall be your friend
Your wish is not my command
Free thought will lead you astray
The brother looks from above
I cannot forsake the brother I love
One can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark
The real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
The stage is set for me
Your life is a play that we wrote
The curtain has to rise now you shall see
This tragedy is the ending we sought
The shadows are dancing upon the wall
The man who has the gift of sight is one with truth in heart
He sees beyond the veil of life, our cave he will depart
Like Icarus he will fly too high and for that he must die
Those unsung prophets and dead messiahs will fall
We choose to live in this darkened cave, far, far away from the light
