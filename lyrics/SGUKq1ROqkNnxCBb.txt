Sunday, wake up, give me a cigarette
Last night's love affair is looking vulnerable in my bed
Silk sheet, blue dawn
Colgate, tongue warm

Won't you quit your crying?
I can't sleep
One minute I'm a little sweetheart
And next minute you are an absolute creep

We've got obsessions
I want to wipe out all the sad ideas that come to me when I am holding you
We've got obsessions
All you ever think about are sick ideas involving me, involving you

Supermarket, oh, what packet of crackers to pick?
They're all the same, one brand, one name-
But really they're not
Look, look, just choose something quick
People are staring, time to go quick and
Skin is on fire, just choose something, something, something!
Pressure overwhelming
Next minute, I am turning out of the door
Facing one week without food
A day, a day, when things, things are pretty bad
But don't let it make you feel sad
The crackers were probably bad luck anyway

Can't let your cold heart be free
When you act like you've got an OCD

We've got obsessions
I want to erase every nasty thought that bugs me every day of every week
We've got obsessions
You never told me what it was that made you strong and what it was that made you weak

We've got obsessions
I want to erase every nasty thought that bugs me every day of every week
We've got obsessions
You never told me what it was that made you strong and what it was that made you weak

(We've got obsessions)
That made you weak, made you weak
Made you weak
(We've got obsessions)
Made you weak, made you weak, made you...

Sunday, wake up, give me a cigarette
Last night's love affair is looking vulnerable again
