When you hear somebody say somebody hits like a girl
How does that hit you?
Is that such a bad thing?
When you hear a song that they play sayin' you run the world
Do you believe it?
Will you live to see it?

When somebody laughs and implies that she asked for it
Just cause she was wearin' a skirt
Ah, is that how that works?
When somebody talks about how it was Adam first
Does that make you second best?
Or did he save the best for last?
