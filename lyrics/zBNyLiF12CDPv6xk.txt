Haunting the cloudless black sky
Braver at night
Hidden as the lips of her c*nt
She is keeping out of sight

Dark as her closed eyelids
Her secret
She comes to you with a serpent's kiss
She has the power to foresee

She don't fear the flames
She smile at the fire
Whisper the words of spell
Without fear without fright

BORN FOR BURNING...
BORN FOR BURNING...
BORN FOR BURNING...
BORN...

She can't feel the pain
She gaze at the sky
In the greedy flames
She will burn tonight

The beauty burning
Like the moon at harvest
Her seared flesh falling apart
And feed the hungry flames

Where the flame still bite her thigh
She is not afraid to die
She will burn again tonight
(she will always burn)
But her spirit shall survive...
