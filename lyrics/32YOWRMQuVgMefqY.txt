Battalions of dethronement
Confront the invincible realm
Purge the imposing reign
Fear no overlord nor spell

A discharge of steel and distress
Tear down the gates of the fortress
Ride the battering ram clash
Spear and sword piercing flesh

Flaming arrows and molten wax
Swing the giant battle ax
Immortals dying at dawn
As the walls of the empire fall

Sword of immortal punishment
Behead thy highness
In a day of royal judgment
Scourge of the enthroned
Scourge of the enthroned

Despise the glory of the throne
The crown of filthiness begone
Decades of hollow supremacy
We bow to no majesty

Depose the inquisitor
Hang the overlord
Pillage the kingdom defiled
The empire overthrown

Sword of immortal punishment
Behead thy highness
In a day of royal judgment
Scourge of the enthroned
Scourge of the enthroned

Fires of a conquering incursion
Burn the mighty throne to the ground
Enslave their women, usurp the crown
Hang the kingdom's servants at the dawn

Thorns piercing the hands and the face of the nailed savior
The hope to be reborn through resurrection is a failure
A snake in the tree on a garden, free of greed and sins
The whore of God spreads the demon seed

The fate of a broken empire
Torched by flames of the purest fire

The end of a majestic age
The sorrowful queen kisses the savage blade

A storm of steel into a clash of shields
Kneel before beheading execution
The tormentor's hammer, kill after kill
Smashing heads on the anvil
Rebellious front, march to dethrone
Bring the opponent's defeat

Battalions of dethronement
Confront the invincible realm
Purge the imposing reign
Fear no overlord nor spell

A discharge of steel and distress
Tear down the gates of the fortress
Ride the battering ram clash
Spear and sword piercing flesh
