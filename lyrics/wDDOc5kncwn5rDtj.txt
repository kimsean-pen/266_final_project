Your name is a triangle
Your heart is a square
I'd love to see you
Way over there
Once I was happy
You found it intriguing
Then you got to me
left me bleeding
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you
I thought we could eat bread
I thought we could talk
On darker days
With our boots kicked off
You look to me
And I look away
Though I had been
Looking
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you...
