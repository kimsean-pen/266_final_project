Cursed!

Just call me misery
Call me bad news
I'll bring you nothing but pain
Dragging this ball and chain
I was blessed with a curse
The devil knows me by name

You can run, hide
If it gives you peace of mind
Don't slip up
The worst is yet to come
Blame it on the bad luck baby
Stay away from me
(Stay away from me)
Got me feeling like a black cat lately
I'll bring you to your knees
Cursed!

I'm starting to break from bending
A losing streak that's never ending
Weed out the weak
I was washed in the pain
Redeemed by suffering

Everything around me falls apart
Is this punishment or just a test of heart
Or did Lady Luck just give up
And turn her back on me

You can run, hide
If it gives you peace of mind
Don't slip up
The worst is yet to come
Blame it on the bad luck baby
Stay away from me
(Stay away from me)
Got me feeling like a black cat lately
I'll bring you to your knees
(So just) Blame it on the bad luck baby
Stay away from me
(Stay away from me)
Got me feeling like a black cat lately
I'll bring you to your knees
