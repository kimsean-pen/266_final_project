Are all the sparks within our lives
Flickering in a constant doubt?
We're a time bomb in disguise
Well prepared to explode

Do you feel warmer? Don't you lie
You raise the temperature, aren't you now?
Cause we're heating up inside
Our calescent hearts are might be the whys and wherefores

We burn the candle and let it engulfed in flames
We melt the wax and the fire slowly fades away
As we stare blankly through the darkness, will you stay?

The fluorescent light shines brighter
in the night when it follows you home
The incandescent lamp glows dimly
every time you decide that you'll roam
You'll wander through the stars that'll
guide you safe and sound to wherever you'll go
I'll wait with my desire for your return
and wish that I'm still a part of your home

When we converse this by and by
If we combust, will we survive? Will our angers reignite?
Set ablaze to our own mind, while we settle the score
All of the sparks within our lives are flickering in a constant doub
