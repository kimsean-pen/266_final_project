I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through a world of woe
Ain't no sickness, toil, nor danger
In that bright land to which I go

I'm goin' there to see my father
Said he'd meet me when I come
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin' over home

I know dark clouds gonna gather 'round me
I know my way'll be rough and steep
Yet beautiful fields lie just before me
Where God's redeemed their vigils keep

I'm goin' there to see my loved ones
Gone before me one by one
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin' over home

I'll soon be free from earthly trials
This body rest in the ol' churchyard
I'll drop this cross of self-denial
And go singing home to God

I'm goin' there to see my savior
To dwell with him no more to roam
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin' over home
I'm only goin' over home
