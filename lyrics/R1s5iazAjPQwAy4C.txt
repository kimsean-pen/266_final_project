Oh God, I don't wanna feel like this
Oh God, nothing that these days won't fix
Oh Lord, I don't wanna be like this
My thoughts, spill up on my mind, no drip

Oh God, I don't wanna feel like this
Oh God, nothing that these days won't fix
Oh Lord, I don't wanna be like this
My thoughts, spill up on my mind, no drip, no drip

I don't wanna settle with the drama
Rip it from my face, you couldn't kill it with the karma
Seven days away but I know seven's a disaster
Seven, seven, you should know by now
Asking for a rollie or a paper
Rock up to your door
I make you rip it through a gater
I been with this shit since I was 14 with retainer
Billabong shirt and my kicks lookin' Kmart
(Oi) You should know I'm gonna flick it like a rhino
Seven days away but I was seven sippin' Milo
Now I'm 24 I burn the place up like a pyro
I could spit a friend since I was sittin' playin' Spyro (True)
I can feel the recall, got a head of tin foil
Swear it on my jeans that I could hold my own
For a bit of Pete's sake, I should hold a switchblade
But I never dreamed that it could be my fault

Oh God, I don't wanna feel like this
Oh God, nothing that these days won't fix
Oh Lord, I don't wanna be like this
My thoughts, spill up on my mind, no drip
Oh God, I don't wanna feel like this
Oh God, nothing that these days won't fix
Oh Lord, I don't wanna be like this
My thoughts, spill up on my mind, no drip, no drip

Oh, no drip no drip
I feel my bones like butter

Ayy-yay
Young pup still back with the
Savagery if they want the drama
Still keep on padding this
Broken heart with designer armour
I'm on that guap that I'm spending
Spending them so exotically
Head still spinning like pottery
Swerve right, just won the lottery
I shiver and shed a tear
Thinking 'bout what could've been
So bitter sweet, baby back it up
Like a jelly bean
She graduated, so gorgeous
I had to take the stand
Head relieve pressure 'cause
Shawty she do it on demand
Get up, I dreamt a lot inside
These silk pyjamas
Sit up, I'm red but rode in on a slick banana
My liver murderous
Happiness never heard of us
Demons I cannot rid 'em
Bubble boy in the kitchen, oh

I can feel the recall, got a head of tin foil
Swear it on my jeans that I could hold my own
For a bit of Pete's sake, I should hold a switchblade
But I never dreamed that it could be my fault

Oh God, I don't wanna feel like this
Oh God, nothing that these days won't fix
Oh Lord, I don't wanna be like this
My thoughts, spill up on my mind, no drip
Oh God, I don't wanna feel like this
Oh God, nothing that these days won't fix
Oh Lord, I don't wanna be like this
My thoughts, spill up on my mind, no drip, no drip

No
