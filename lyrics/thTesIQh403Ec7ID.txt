"Through the marvels of scientific advance
My voice is coming to you from a satellite circling
In outer space.
Through this unique means,
I convey to you
And to all mankind
America's wish
For peace
On Earth."

I held my head, as it left the ground
The belts grew tight, as the blast grew loud
The loving wish, whispered in my ear
Please leave with grace, all the best my dear, yeah.
Its like... I held your hand as I pulled you in
Your lips sealed tight, ready to begin
I kissed you first then you kissed my ear
If I ask you once, will you ask me every year.

Do you feel alive?
(Imagine, Imagine.)
Do you feel alive?
(Imagine, Imagine.)

The sun, it set in the night time sky
The stars they cast a glow upon my eyes
The Earth itself a burning ball of light, yeah.
Its like... and our first love was ignited, late that night.

Do you feel alive?
(Imagine, Imagine.)
Do you feel alive?
(Imagine, Imagine.)

The stars in your eyes, light up the sky
With all its light, and fire, and sound
The stars in your eyes, light up the sky
With all its light, and fire, and sound

The stars in your eyes, light up the sky (Do you feel alive?)
With all its light, and fire, and sound (Imagine, Imagine.)
The stars in your eyes, light up the sky (Do you feel alive?)
With all its light, and fire, and sound (Imagine, Imagine.)
The stars in your eyes, light up the sky (Do you feel alive?)
With all its light, and fire, and sound (Imagine, Imagine.)
The stars in your eyes, light up the sky (Do you feel alive?)
With all its light, and fire, and sound (Imagine, Imagine.)
