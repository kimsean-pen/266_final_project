In these eyes
More than words
More than anything that I've spoken
As the skies
Turn to gray
My heart's just about to crack open
So the story goes
But there's something you should know
Before I walk away and I blow the ending

I never wanna be without you
Oh no
Here I go
Now you know
What I feel about you
There's no running
I must have been wrong to doubt you
Oh no
There I go
No control
And I've fallen so
Now you know

Feel so light
Cravin' oxygen
All these truths left me empty
Will you run?
Can you handle it?
'Cause I need you to tell me
Maybe this is bold
But I'm hoping you'll stay for the happy ending

I never wanna be without you
Oh no
Here I go
Now you know
What I feel about you
There's no running
I must have been wrong to doubt you
Oh no
There I go
No control
And I've fallen so
Now you know

No I won't look back when I tell you what I think about you
Yeah yeah yeah
No I won't look back when I tell you what I think about you
Yeah yeah

So the story goes
Yea, you already know
So don't be a fool and go spoil the ending

I never wanna be without you
Oh no
Here I go
Now you know
What I feel about you
There's no running
I must have been wrong to doubt you
Oh no
There I go
No control
And I've fallen so
Now
I never wanna be without you
Oh no
Here I go
Now you know
What I feel about you
There's no running
I must have been wrong to doubt you
Oh no
There I go
No control
And I've fallen so
Now you know
