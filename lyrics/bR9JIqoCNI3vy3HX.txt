I will always be hoping, hoping
You will always be holding
Holding my heart in your hand
I will understand

I will understand someday, one day
You will understand always
Always from now until then

When it will be right? I don't know
What it will be like? I don't know

We live in hope of deliverance
From the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
From the darkness that surrounds us
(From the darkness that surrounds us)

And I wouldn't mind knowing, knowing
That you wouldn't mind going
Going along with my plan

When it will be right? I don't know
What it will be like? I don't know

We live in hope of deliverance
From the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
From the darkness that surrounds us
(From the darkness that surrounds us)

Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
From the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
From the darkness that surrounds us
(From the darkness that surrounds us)
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
(I will understand)
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
(I will understand)
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance.
