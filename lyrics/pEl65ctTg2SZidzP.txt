Holding back the year
Thinking of the fear I've had so long
When somebody hears
Listen to the fear that's gone
Strangled by the wishes of pater
Hoping for the arms of mater
Get to neither sooner or later
Oh-oh-oh
Holding back the years
Chance for me escape from all I know
Holding back the tears
Cause nothing here has grown
I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all those years
Nothing had the chance to be good
Nothing ever could y-e-a-h
Oh-oh-oh
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
So tired
Alright oh now
Well I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all those years
And nothing had the chance to be good
Cause nothing ever could
Oh yeah oh
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
Holding holding holding
A-a-a-h... va-la-la-la-la-la-la-la la
I said ooh yeah
That's all I have today
It's all I have to say
That's all I have today
It's all I have to say
