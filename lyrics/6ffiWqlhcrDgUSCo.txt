How long?
Always been here
It almost seems like yesterday
How to picture
It's the little things that slip away
Build away the blisters
But they'll find a way to take a little bit
They won't find us
If you believe in it

How long?
How long?
Can we keep holding on?
How long
How long
Can we keep holding on?

A house on fire
Burning all the passed away
And what defines us
When
It's the little things that slip away
In differ you're honest
What do you think what happened?
We stood for something
If you believe in it
If you believe in it

How long
(Burn this all away)
How long
(Burn this all away)
Can we keep holding on?

How long
(We keep holding on and on)
How long
(Can we keep, can we keep)
Can we keep holding on?
How long?
