Flow backwards
That's all your life's about
And it's not right
Oh sometimes
I wish I could pull your eyes out, yeah
I flow backwards
Home's where I'm resting at
Day and night
Oh sometimes
I feel I could knock your brains out
Come on, yeah
Hit by a car, come on
Drown in a river, yeah
Locked in a jar
Caught by the winter, yeah
The sand will smother, come on
The sand will smother, yeah
Come on, yeah
I flow backwards
Home's where I'm resting at
Day and night
Oh sometimes
I wish I could pull your eyes out, yeah
