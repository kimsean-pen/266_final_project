I can't afford to seize
I never stay for too long
And when the whistle blows
Every light goes out in order

Waking up inside
A profane dream
And someone innocent
Pull the storage cell is empty

Your straining stare, cut from every other home
In the sequence of our unidentified
Impersonator, 'cause you know just what to say
And by any other name is still a lie

The amethyst will beat into your skull, come pouring out
Hoping to see why you don't show
Any emotion you fear that's
Breaking you open to feel our wild force

Whatever comes of this, I want to fill the big frame, beside your prison bed
Every eye sealed shut with resentment
I can't afford to speak in this nauseous daze
Once the ice is broke, every hand you held will pull you down

Are we made like this? By a raging fool
We were wrong and we resisted our own charge
Are we trained like this? Bite the giving hand
We were lost and there was no place we could go

Your straining stare, cut from every other home
In the sequence of our unidentified
Impersonator, 'cause you know just what to say
And by any other name is still a lie

The amethyst will beat into your skull, come pouring out
Hoping to see why you don't show
Any emotion you fear that's
Breaking you open to feel our wild force

Crawl out my shell
Change when will I get a chance
Don't lose your nerve
Again, when will I get a chance

Crawl out my shell (Out in the dark I can hear someone singing along with us)
Change when will I get a chance (I never thought that could be on my own again)
Don't lose your nerve (Now all this time I spent waiting for something to change is gone)
Again, when will I get a chance (Never escaping the echoing sound of your locked engage)

I might as well be dead
When will I get to it?
