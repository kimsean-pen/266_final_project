I remember when I saw you
You know I couldn't look away
You're the spark that stars a fire
Tell me, do you feel the same
So give me one more shot tonight
I will tell you if my heart stops beating right
Let me show you that the only thing I know
No matter where we go
I feel just like we did when we connected
Feeling electric
...
Feeling electric
...
You can tell me all your secrets
I will never tell a soul
I'll make a promise and I'll keep it
I will never let you go
So give me one more shot tonight
...
I will tell you if my heart stops beating right
...
Let me show you that the only thing I know
No matter where we go
I feel just like we did when we connected
Feeling electric
...
Feeling electric
So give me one more shot tonight
...
I will tell you if my heart stops beating right
...
Let me show you that the only thing I know
No matter where we go
I feel just like we did when we connected
Feeling electric
Feeling electric
...
