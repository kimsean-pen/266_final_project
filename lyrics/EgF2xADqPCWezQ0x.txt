i see them gathered see
them on the shore
i turned to look once more
and he who knows me not takes me to the belly
of darkness

the tears run swift and hard and when they fall
even the comfort of a stone would be a gain
there was a time
when i thought
i would have to give up
but i'm thankful that i'm
strong as i am and i'll try to do
the best i can

tears will run swift and tears will come that fall like rain
i pray that it's swift though tears will fall as cold as pain

i pray to the almighty
let me not to him do
as he has unto me
teach my beloved children
who have been enslaved
to reach for the light continually

so many times i prayed
so many times i've prayed
for you
prayed for you
the tears run swift and hard and cold as pain
even the comfort of a stone would be a gain
had i not the strength and wisdom of a warrior
i would have to give up
but i'm thankful that i'm
strong as i am
and i'll try to do the best i can

tears will run swift and tears will come that fall like rain
i pray that it's swift though tears will fall as cold as pain

i pray to the almighty
let us not do as he has unto us
teach my beloved children
i've been a slave
but reach for the
light continually

wisdom is the flame
wisdom is the brave warrior who will carry us into the sun
i pray that it's swift though tears will come that fall like rain

so many times so many times
