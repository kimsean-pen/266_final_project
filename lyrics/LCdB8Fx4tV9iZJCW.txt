I would never look on your post or your messages
'Cause I ain't really fuckin' with them niggas that you with
Pull up on his ass with a hundred round stick
Pull up on his ass with the Glock, with the dick
This is not a Glock 45, this a 26
Niggas talk a lot, they only get the best from me
Fuck nigga stop playin' 'fore we stretch somethin'
Fuck nigga stop playin' 'fore we wet somethin'
