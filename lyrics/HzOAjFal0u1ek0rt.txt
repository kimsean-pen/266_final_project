It burns deep down inside of me
We have ourselves to blame
Not questioning, accepted as the truth

Debate this fight it's just cause
The facts do not support theirs
To liberate a people
And rid them of tyrant rule

Is it time to make a change
Are we closer than before
Can we help them break away
Are we profiting from war
It's time to make a change

Intrigued
Got your attention
Deceived
Since the inception

Our brave
Fight for what reason
Compelled
Can we clean up this mess
The loss of loved ones
A perverse request
They continue the same rhetoric

These derelicts that profit
Win or lose
Is it time to make a change
Are we closer than before
Can we help them break away

Are we profiting from war
It's time to make a change
Time
For
Change
Fight
The
Fear

Find
The
Truth
Time
For
Change
The only thing
That I believe
Will help us see this through is faith
Pray they will forgive
Forgive our arrogance

So we can make it right
Right what they have wronged
See you sweat
Unexpected, controversial
Get used to it
Things are gonna get personal
Your sympathy
A pitiful display you stutter
Your empathy
Means nothing if there is no honor
Responsible
Of this you are incapable
We implicate
Incriminate
Exacerbate
Too much at stake
Our Fathers, Mothers
Sisters, Brothers
Sons and Daughters

Forced
Perpetuating their ideals
A mindless act
To stay the course

Is it time to make a change
Are we closer than before
Can we help them break away
Are we profiting from war
Is it time to make a change
Are we closer than before
Can we help them break away
Are we profiting from war
Is it time to make a change
A change from what it's been
Can we help them break away
Is our patience wearing thin
It's time to make a change
Time
For
Change
Fight
The
Fear
Find
The
Truth
Time
For
Change
