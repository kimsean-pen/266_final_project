Broken frizz bitter on my tongue
I took a breath, I cleared my lungs
Excuses gather spin
It's not that I deceived you but I'm bound to
Like waking in a dream
A world away with different outcomes
Taking what you need
You'll make your way without...

It's not impossible
It's not impossible
It's not impossible
For you to be coming down, down
It's not impossible
It's not impossible
It's not impossible
For me to go on, and on, and

It seems my trials, my despair
I wish I wasn't so aware
A solitary fall
Where everything will hold [?] get through
Once ordinary dream
A place you go you can't return from
Simple as it seems
A one-way track to nowhere

It's not impossible
It's not impossible
It's not impossible
For you to be coming down, down
It's not impossible
It's not impossible
It's not impossible
For me to go on, and on, on
