If you can't sleep tonight
And if a fever grips you tight
Theres a place we can explore
Open wide the door...

(chorus)
We may be the haunted men
But we will hold our heads up high
When we're walking down the street of dreams

The dead beats and the dispossesed
The seekers of unlikeliness
The beauty walk on and on
With the beast tomight

(chorus)

Down the street of dreams
We walk down the street of dreams

A thousand doorways open there
A thousand voices sweet and clear
Emotions felt with a passion
Never felt before

(chorus)

When you walk down the street of dreams
You gotta hold your head up high
