Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of a stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip, drip, drip of a raindrop
When the morning shower's through
So a voice within me keeps repeating
You, you, you
Night and day
You are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter darling where you are
I think of you
Night and day
Day and night
Why is it so?
That this feeling follows me
Where-ever I go
From the roaring traffic's boom
To the silence of my loney room
I think of you
Night and day
Day and night
Under the hide of me
Is an oh such a yearning
Burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life
Making love with you
Night and day
Night and day
You are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
This torment won't be through
'Till you let me spend my life
Making love with you
Night and day
Night and day
Night and day
