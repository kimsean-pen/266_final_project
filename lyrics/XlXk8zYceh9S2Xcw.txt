My heart is a blue ridge moutain
And my head an overflowing fountain
My heart is a blue ridge moutain
But I never never knew, I never knew, never knew.
Never never knew, never knew
Well, I woke up this morning
And I saw a new day dawning
Oh I woke up this morning
But I never never knew, I never knew, never knew.
Never never knew, never knew
My hand are like John Henry's
Sing a song for wistful memory
It's a soul, a man, it can be
But I never never knew, I never knew, never knew.
Never never knew, never knew
Well I woke up this morning
And I saw a new day dawning
Oh I woke up this morning
But I never never knew, I never knew, never knew.
Never never knew, never knew
My heart is a blue ridge moutain
And my head an overflowing fountain
My heart is a blue ridge moutain
But I never never knew, I never knew, never knew.
Never never knew, never knew
And I never never knew, I never knew, never knew.
Never never knew, never knew
Oh I never never knew, I never knew, never knew.
Never never knew, never knew
