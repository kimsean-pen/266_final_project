Ooh you're so electric
Ooh I can't forget ya
Got all the goods, etcetera
Let you go no I ain't gonna let ya
You got me saying

Hold up
Hold up
Wait a minute I wanna talk to ya
Hold up
Hold up
Wait a minute let me get inside ya

I know what I want
I know what I want
I know what I want and it's what you got
I know what I want
I know what I want
I know what I want and I'm feeling it a lot
And I know what I want and it's what you got
And you know what I want and it's what you got
You're outta sight
No one can see you baby

Ooh I think it's simple
Ooh forget the label
Don't want to be a ball around your ankle
But maybe I can be your safe zone
You've got me saying

Hold up
Hold up
Wait a minute I wanna talk to ya
Hold up
Hold up
Wait a minute let me get inside ya

Let's get connected
Feel your essence
Don't say too much or you're gonna wreck it

And I know what I want and it's what you got
And you know what I want and it's what you got
You're outta sight
No one can see you baby

Hold up
Hold up
Wait a minute I wanna talk to ya
Hold up
Hold up
Wait a minute let me get inside ya

Hold up
Hold up
Wait a minute I wanna talk to ya
Hold up
Hold up
Wait a minute let me get inside ya

Hold up
Hold up
Wait a minute I wanna talk to ya
Hold up
Hold up
Wait a minute let me get inside ya
