Today's the day, we're out to play
And lost our way, it's always the same, oh baby now
Climbed the trees, swam the seven seas
We've grazed our knees and no-one's to blame

Come and sit beside us, we'll give you such a thrill
We're not nice we're cool as ice, we'll give you quite a chill
Let your imagination take over on this ride
Out of sight, all right, hold on tight

Come on, come on, get it on
Riding in our rollercoaster
Come on, come along, get it on
Riding in our rollercoaster of love

So don't be shy, you'll soon be high, we'll touch the sky
You'll never believe oh baby now
Go round and round, but don't look down, we won't be found
You'd better believe it

Come and sit beside us, we'll give you such a thrill
We're not nice we're cool as ice, we'll give you quite a chill
Let your imagination take over on this ride
Out of sight, all right, hold on tight

Come on, come on, get it on
Riding in our rollercoaster
Come on, come along, get it on
Riding in our rollercoaster of love

Come on, come on, get it on
Riding in our rollercoaster
Come on, come along, get it on
Riding in our rollercoaster of love

Come on, come on
Riding in our rollercoaster of love
Come love
Come love
Come love
