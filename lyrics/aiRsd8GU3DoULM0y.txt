I used to know you better, better than anyone
Now I don't know you at all
You used to keep my secrets, shallow has turned to deepness
Now I got someone else to call

Just 'cause I don't make a thing about it
Don't mean that I never think about it, 'cause I do
Just 'cause I learned how to live without you
Don't mean that I ever really wanted to, oh

I miss you, yeah, yeah
After all that we've been through
I never told you that I do
But I miss you, ooh
Even after all this time
I got your body on my mind

This might seem out of nowhere, I get it if you don't care
Guess I just don't know what to say
Don't know if you remember that night in late September
For me, it feels like yesterday
