Can't stop the hurt, can't stop the bleeding
I am invisible
Can't stop the thought, nor the feeling
I don't exist at all

But when you call my name
Do you feel the same way?
That we're trapped in time
We're both living a lie

I live in a tower of my own creation
I'm indivisible
From the thoughts that make up all my memories
Transcendental

But when you call my name
Do you feel the same way?
That we're trapped in time
We're both living a lie

Many days have come and gone
Since the day I was born
And the autumn of life has finally come
With the promise of winter thaw
