It's tough to stay attractive baby
With your tongue upsailing down my neck
It's a bullet-proof offer and I can't accept
It's tough to maintain focus baby
Now all my elephants are in the room
We crave the fiction when we need the truth
You need to find a different boy's heart to chew
And all these emoticons and words
Try to make it better but they only make it worse
It's tough to feign indifference baby
Now I'm spending all the money I have
Trying to impress you is kinda driving me mad
And I don't blame the pressure or the vultures in the sky
I blame what happened everytime we're under neon lights
We crave the tension in a room with a view
You need to find a different boy's heart to chew
And all these emoticons and words
Try to make it better but they only make it worse
And all these emoticons and words
Fail to make it better their attempts just make it worse
It's everything I want and nothing I can keep
And behind these metaphors
I want you literally
We crave the fiction when we need the truth
You need to find a different boy's heart to chew
And all these emoticons and words
Try to make it better but they only make it worse
But I like it here so much I might stay
The edge of nowhere is such a beautiful place
The edge of nowhere is such a beautiful place
