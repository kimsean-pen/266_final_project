I, I got sick, I'll do that
Yeah, sick of the bug I'm fearing
I've gone bad and won't go back
Love so deep, my love runs so deep
That I can't stop watching you, can't stop watching you
On my screen, won't you update me
No I'm always watching you, always watching you
I, I got sick, I'll do that
Yeah, sick of the bug I'm fearing
I've gone bad and won't go back
If you buy some new shoes, when you buy some new clothes
Got to know, I've got to know
When you're watching TV or your favourite movie
Got to know, to know
My heart beats for you, my heart beats
For the thrill of watching you, thrill of watching you
Where you've been, what you had to eat
Say I'm always watching you, always watching you
I, I got sick, I'll do that
Yeah, sick of the bug I'm fearing
I've gone bad and won't go back

I, I got sick, I'll do that
Yeah, sick of the bug I'm fearing
I've gone bad and won't go and won't go
I, I got sick, I'll do that
Yeah, sick of the bug I'm fearing
I've gone bad, yeah, I've gone bad and won't go back
