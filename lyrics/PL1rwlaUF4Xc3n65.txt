I'm up on a hill top where I
Keep you in sight, my little toys
I buried you because the sun
Will melt them

Got you up my sleeve
Got you up my sleeve
Got you up my sleeve
Got you up my sleeve
Got you up my sleeve

Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down

Taking over

Taking over your life
I'm taking over your scene
Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya
I would hope see the face I would hope you see her face

Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down (taking over)

There's no survivors
There's no survivors

Don't even snow (we're not that disturbed)
Don't even snow

Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down (taking over)

There's no survivors
There's no survivors

Taking over your life
Taking over your life
I'm taking over the scene
I'm taking everything
All I wanted it all
My little trick
I wouldn't mind just a milligram up my sleeve
I've got you up my sleeve
I've Got you up my sleeve
I've got you up my sleeve

Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
There's no survivors

Taking over your life
Taking over your life
I'm taking over the scene
I'm taking everything
I'm taking everything

I've got to melt it X 10
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down there's no survivors
There is no survivors
