The hour has begun
Your eyes have now opened

To a world where madness craves
To a world where hope's enslaved
Oh, I'll tremble for my love always

Your window's opened wide
Your innocence takes flight

To a world where madness craves
To a world where hope's enslaved
Oh, I'll tremble for my love always

It's a world where madness craves
It's a world where hope's enslaved
Oh, I'll tremble for my love always

It's a world where madness craves
It's a world where hope's enslaved
Yeah, I'll tremble for you, love, always
