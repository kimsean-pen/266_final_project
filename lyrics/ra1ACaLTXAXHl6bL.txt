Many years before I kept track of the years I felt I would

Look back otherwise why did I write down everything that entered my mind

Check out these lines like I'm staring and I'm soon ticking when it is closed

In twenty holes how could I say what point I will gain perspective later on

No, I had to survive it by the soundtrack made of our short lives

Making sense of hologram ecology
I'll be up crying, nursing into grace and
Hiding in the pages adding up to me

Eternity
'Til I live

It's like a topography that is made of cartography of me
All those feelings everyday the bus stop pulls to size up the entire world
And while I broke your tubes and carving at me all the times I had done you wrong
I hope I'm sorry, certain times in our lives come to take up more space than others

And time's gonna take it

Time that Kenny said I broke in over the summer
It was the evening when he climbed that Jeep
I was afraid what he was doing inside so I
Followed him to stop a robbery

All along we're gonna feel some numbness
Oxymoron of our lives
Getting fed up by the hunger
Supersize we found inside
He will know what's real or numbness
Catching up and climbing life
Speaking like a hug of thunder
Lit up by the lights of dusk outside

All along we're gonna feel some numbness
Oxymoron of our lives
Getting fed up by the hunger
Supersize we found inside
They won't know us by our numbers
Catching up and climbing life
Speaking like a hug of thunder
Lit up by the lights of dusk outside

It was a military base across the street
We watch them training while we all eat

It was a military base across the street
We watch them training while we all eat
We watch them training while we all eat
