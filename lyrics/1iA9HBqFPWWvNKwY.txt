When the curtains open finally revealing horror
Hiding scenary smells like death
Everyone who's not breathing anymore wake up
Fingers of despots turn on the lights
From the dark clouds sounds trumpets
Everyone knows the last cycle is over

Blood and tears rain like an inexorable sentence
Skies are crossed by spider webs
Neon Canahan is take off to it's profane owners
General dispair has the metropolis
The great Babylon falls one more time
The great Babylon falls one more time

This is the end of everything
There's no escape even in the shadows
Shadowrun has just begun

Love is cooled down in each human heart
Desperated, everybody fornicates while cry
In a last try to reach a sparkle of pleasure
And prostate with their mouths on dry land
But from breasts of the nature doesn't
Burgeon anything else but sorrow

And they don't understand in this act
Hold in esteen the enthroned dark angel
Who was also humiliated under divine superb
This is the end of everything
There's no escape even in the shadows
Shadowrun has just begun

Shadowrun
Shadowrun
Shadowrun

And they don't understand in this act
Hold in esteen the enthroned dark angel
Who was also humiliated under divine superb
This is the end of everything
There's no escape even in the shadows
Shadowrun has just begun, begun, begun
