She raises up her voice
She raises up her voice
To the public, she will speak
She makes her way to stardom

May the warning on your head
Be a chain unto your neck
Don't give in, don't give in
"Come along with us", they say

Let's lie in wait for someone
Let's waylay on their soul
Lets swallow them alive
To the bottomless pit they wait

They take everything they can bleed dry
And they fill up their house with waste
So don't stay and make believe that they are home
So don't stay and make believe that they are home

Don't go along, don't beg for blood
Don't set your feet, don't beg to bleed
Don't go along, don't beg for blood
Don't set your feet, don't beg to bleed

These men lay and wait for their own blood to rise up
Don't set the trap for everyone to see it
These men waylay on themselves
Beast, I never sang along to the beast

They shake inside their blood
We pass the storm, don't go, refrain
For, for I never knew your name
From a whisper she raises her voice to me

Unsung
