I don't wanna go to sleep
Just don't feel like coming down
I wish you could be with me
Oh, baby, I could show you how

We're supposed to be...
Driving too fast
Throw our money around
Watch the sun go down together
Wasting our time
Be like Bonnie and Clyde
Are you ready or not?

We're supposed to be...
Getting fucked up in the weekend
Everybody is free to join me
Fuck you
Getting fucked up by the weekend
You and I and friends can join me
Fuck you

Getting fucked up in the weekend
Everybody is free to join me
Fuck you
Getting fucked up by the weekend
You and I and friends can join me
Fuck you

Here we go
Once again
Let us bounce the pain away
You and I
We pretend
But we'll never be the same

We're supposed to be...
Driving too fast
Throw our money around
Watch the sun go down together
Wasting our time
Be like Bonnie and Clyde
Are you ready or not?

We're supposed to be...
Getting fucked up in the weekend
Everybody is free to join me
Fuck you
Getting fucked up by the weekend
You and I and friends can join me
Fuck you

Getting fucked up in the weekend
Everybody is free to join me
Fuck you
Getting fucked up by the weekend
You and I and friends can join me
Fuck you

We're supposed to be...
Getting fucked up in the weekend
Getting fucked up by the weekend

We're supposed to be...
Getting fucked up in the weekend
Everybody is free to join me
Fuck you
Getting fucked up by the weekend
You and I and friends can join me
Fuck you

Getting fucked up in the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend
Fuck you
Getting fucked up by the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend
Fuck you
