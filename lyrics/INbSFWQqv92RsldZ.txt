When time scrambles and it's gone away
Can you stop to start again?
No time.

No one will laugh will laugh when it strikes-
This diabolic plan to break up all order
And who holds the key to stop
The countdown of the global secret combination?

These heroes changing
Recognize we've been so undermined
Danger walking blind
But those hands on the clock
Give no room, no thought
No words
No mind
No age
Sequence erased
NO TIME!

Prolong the wait with hopeless information
Time and space erased, no indication
Knife in the back I stagger to the phone
Who can I call I'm now complete, alone!

These heroes changing
Recognize we've been so undermined
Danger walking blind
But those hands on the clock
Give no room, no thought
No words
No mind
No age
Sequence erased
NO TIME!
