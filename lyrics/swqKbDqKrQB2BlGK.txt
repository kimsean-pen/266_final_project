We bide our time, though the time is fine
Oh, to be there, I could be there, say you'll be there

You know the way, I, can't resist you, I, said to myself I'd try
Why do we waste time, hiding it inside?
I want you to be mine

Now it's been and gone, you say what you would have done
You would've been there, I wished you'd been there, I needed you there
And if we try once more, would you give me it all?
I won't believe it, til I can feel it, can you feel it?

You know the way, I, can't resist you, I, said to myself I'd try
