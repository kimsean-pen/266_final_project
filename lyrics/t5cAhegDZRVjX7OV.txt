I'll kiss ur lips
Leave it on ur tongue
Take U back to ur glory days
I'll pick U up in my boyfriends car
Take U fast
Steal ur breath away

PRE-We'll be turnt up on a funday
Crying on a Tuesday
Weekends always hurt so much

We'll be higher than a blue flame
Floatin' like an airplane
Speeding through the head rush

CHROUS
When I'm in my sacred space
I can feel u move through me
And when the DJ sets us free
We will be ecstasy

When I don't even know my name
When my wreck less cant be tamed
And when the DJ sets us free
Will be ecstasy

I'm out of it but I'm into you
Where do I stop and you begin
We hit the top, and we're coming down
But I know we'll be back again

PRE-We'll be turnt up on a funday
Crying on a Tuesday
Weekends always hurt so much

We'll be higher than a blue flame
Floatin' like an airplane
Speeding through the head rush

When I'm in my sacred space
I can feel u move through me
And when the DJ sets us free
We will be ecstasy

When I don't even know my name
When my wreck less cant be tamed
And when the DJ sets us free
Will be ecstasy
BRIDGE
And we bow down
To the DJ at the alter
This is my religion
And we bow down
Yeah my bodies feeling altered
Now I can find the rhythm
