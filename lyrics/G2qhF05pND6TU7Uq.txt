Bury me standing under your window
With this cinderblock in hand
Yeah, 'cause no one will ever feel like this again
And if I could move I'm sure it would only be to crawl
Back to you
I must have dragged my guts a block
They were gone by the time we (talked)

Woah I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
Know that I could crush you with my voice
Woah I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
Know that I could crush you with my voice

Stood on my roof and tried to see you
Forgetting about me
Hide the details, I dont want to know a thing

I hate the way you say my name, like its something secret
My pen is the barrel of the gun
Remind me which side you should be

Woah I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
Know that I could crush you with my voice
Woah I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
Know that I could crush you with my voice

Stood on my roof and tried to see you
Forgetting about me
Hide the details, I dont want to know a thing

Wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel
Wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel

(Woah I want to hate you half as much as I hate my)
(Woah I want to hate you half as much as I hate my)

Woah I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
Know that I could crush you with my voice
Woah I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
Know that I could crush you with my voice
