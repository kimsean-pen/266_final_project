She's madness but her name is magic
Her kisses turn your heart to ashes
Take my test I hope you pass it
Paint it 1940's classic (Woah)
I fill up your plate, the whole thing
Over time your day, it's all me
30 minutes late, it's my fault
My fault
I don't care if you love me not
Take it slow-motion astronaut
We can do what we do, And we can stay cool
Don't need to label what we got
We can play connect the dots
We can do what we do, And we can stay cool!
(Woah!)
Yeah we can stay cool!
She's busy but you own her heart beat
She's got you on your rhythm but your still on repeat
I fill up your plate, the whole thing
Over time your day, it's all me
30 minutes late, it's my fault
My fault
I don't care if you love me not
Take it slow-motion astronaut
We can do what we do, And we can stay cool
Don't need to label what we got
We can play connect the dots
We can do what we do, And we can stay cool!
(Woah!)
Yeah we can stay cool!
I'm sitting on the moon, coz I can
Ask the boy who lives here for a little dance
The man on the moon
Come down soon
I don't care if you love me not
Take it slow-motion astronaut
We can do what we do, And we can stay cool
Don't need to label what we got
We can play connect the dots
We can do what we do, And we can stay cool!
(Woah!)
Yeah we can stay cool!
(Woah!)
Yeah we can stay cool!
