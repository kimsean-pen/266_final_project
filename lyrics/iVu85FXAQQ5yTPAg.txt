I've learned to slam on the brake
Before I even turn the key
Before I make the mistake
Before I lead with the worst of me

Give them no reason to stare
No slippin' up if you slip away
So I got nothing to share
No, I got nothing to say

Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned, yeah
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap-tap-tapping on the glass
Waving through a window

I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch-watch-watching people pass
I'm waving through a window, oh

Can anybody see?
Is anybody waving back at me?

We start with stars in our eyes (stars in our eyes)
We start believing that we belong (we belong)
But every sun doesn't rise (sun doesn't rise)
And no one tells you where you went wrong

Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned, yeah
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap-tap-tapping on the glass
Waving through a window

Try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for the answer to appear
While I'm watch-watch-watching people pass
I'm waving through a window, oh-oh

Can anybody see?
Is anybody waving?

When you're falling in a forest, there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in a forest, there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?

When you're falling in a forest, there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?

Did I even make a sound?
Did I even make a sound?
It's like I never made a sound
Will I ever make a sound?

On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap-tap-tapping on the glass
Waving through a window, oh

I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch-watch-watching people pass
Waving through a window, oh-oh

Can anybody see?
Is anybody waving back at me?

Is anybody waving? (Is anybody waving?)
Waving, waving (Is anybody waving?)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
