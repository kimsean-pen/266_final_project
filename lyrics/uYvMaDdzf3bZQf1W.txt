In South Carolina
There're many tall pines
I remember the oak tree
That we used to climb
But now, when I'm lonesome
I always pretend
That I'm gettin' the feel
Of hickory wind

I'd started out younger
Had most everything
All the riches and pleasures
What else can life bring?
But it makes me feel better
Each time it begin
Callin' me home
Hickory wind

It's a hard way to find out
That trouble is real
In a faraway city
With a faraway feel
But it makes me feel better
Each time it begin
Callin' me home
Hickory wind

Keeps callin' me home
Hickory wind
