You came to my show, and I saw you in the crowd
I didn't know your name,

I didn't know your name
I asked all my friends who you were and your story
They told me the same,

they told me the same

I've left my heart to you, but it's not fair
Coz you're taking me for granted baby
I made a start with you, but it's not fair
Coz you're over the Atlantic baby

One journey for you but it's worth it
One life here with me and it's magic
One journey for you, but it's worth it
One life here with me and it's magic

You stayed in my head where I saw you all the time
I didn't think you care, I didn't think you care
I found you one day with a mouth full of attitude
And you stole me away, you stole me away

I've left my heart to you, but it's not fair
Coz you're taking me for granted baby
I made a start with you, but it's not fair
Coz you're over the Atlantic baby

One journey for you but it's worth it
One life here with me and it's magic
One journey for you, but it's worth it
One life here with me

One journey for you
one life here with me
One journey for you
one life here with me

One journey for you, but it's worth it
One life here with me and it's magic
One journey for you, but it's worth it
One life here with me and it's magic
One journey for you, but it's worth it
One life here with me and it's magic
One journey for you, but it's worth it
One life here with me and it's magic
One journey for you, but it's worth it
One life here with me and it's magic
One journey for you, but it's worth it
One life here with me and it's magic
