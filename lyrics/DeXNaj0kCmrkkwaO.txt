Feel to get a suit for tonight
You know I got a pretty young thing by my side
She's gonna call me when she's finished with her hair
And when she's found something sexy to wear

And if she wants to
We can hold each other's hands just that slow
Oh, she can hit it to the ground and drop it low
I've been waiting all week to get to know
Oh, just how to make a move, I

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

Tell me, is it easier to see
That I don't want nobody else for you and me?
Minutes later and I'm racing to your door
I never wanted someone's touch like this before

And if she wants to
We can hold each other's hands just that slow
Oh, she can hit it to the ground and drop it low
I've been waiting all week to get to know
Oh, just how to make a move, I

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I feel your skin connect to mine
It's at the top of anything that I could want
I let it take all my time
Nothing else I want, nothing on my mind

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side

I just wanna feel your touch
I never wanna give it up
You can never give me way too much
While I'm by your side
