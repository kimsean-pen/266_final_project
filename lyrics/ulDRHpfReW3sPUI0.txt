If you wanna leave
if you wanna go

baby don't leave
why don't we go
somewhere somewhere somewhere somewhere

why don't we go
somewhere somewhere somewhere somewhere

Would you like to go to paradise
Cos I'm not tryna go alone
Runaway with me to paradise
If you wanna leave, then we can go
Cos the real world told me lies
The realest lies ever told
so let's run away and find paradise
paradise
and soon paradise will be home

If you wanna leave
if you wanna go
baby don't leave yet

take my hand, shut your eyes and imagine
wouldn't it be nice
just to have, an escape, a distraction
far away from this life
I tried to be cool but this world's too cruel
for me, to sit around, & simply drown in fear
so I'm asking you, what would you do
if we could get out of here

Would you like to go to paradise
Cos Im not tryna go alone
Runaway with me to paradise
If you wanna leave, then we can go
Cos the real world told me lies
The realest lies ever told
so let's run away and find paradise
paradise
and soon paradise will be home

If you wanna leave
if you wanna go
baby don't leave yet

your love's like a fantasy
nothing like what I saw on the news yesterday
another man down, blood on the ground
makes me wanna just runaway
where we run is a mystery
ignorance is bliss to me
cos whenever I turn on my tv it's just misery

I tried to be cool but this world's too cruel
for me, to sit around, & simply drown in fear
so I'm asking you, what would you do
if we could get out of here

Would you like to go to paradise
Cos I don't wanna go alone
Runaway with me to paradise
If you wanna leave, then we can go
Cos the real world told me lies
The realest lies ever told
so let's run away and find paradise
paradise
and soon paradise will be home

(Paradise is an escape)
Hooooome
(If you wanna leave if you wanna go)
Hoooome
(If you wanna leave if you wanna go)
Paradise is in the mind baby
Paradise is in the mind baby
it won't take too long to find baby
Paradise is in the mind baby
In Paradise we're free
to do what we want to do
we're free
baby
