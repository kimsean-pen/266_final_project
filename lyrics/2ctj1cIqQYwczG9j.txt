I watched you walk out from the world before
And nothing asked you to be much more
Than just a handful of dust
Oh lonesome valley, lonesome valley
Oh lonesome valley, lonesome valley

Out here the ghost wears the feathered crown of blues
And the sickle moon to watch over all the lost horizon
All through the lonesome valley, the lonesome valley
All through the lonesome valley, the lonesome valley

Now i'm not worried about heading back
I will be punished by a civil death
If i've done enough but not my best

I turn my pain into a simple plan
Harmony onward friend
Dragging myself out again
Oh through the lonesome valley, the lonesome valley
Oh through the lonesome valley, the lonesome valley

Now let the wolf judge me as i stand
Harmony onward friend
Until i see that old star again
High over the lonesome valley
High over the lonesome valley
