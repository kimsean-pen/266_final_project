I stayed inside all morning
Watching waves of rain pass over
Cold and dry by the window
I didn't turn a light on
The fire place dead since last night
Emptyness inside, cold morning
low grey sky immence living belly of a silver fur thing
in waves of weather the house lies
piled up wood with me inside
i'm piled up dust
a life dreaming or walking whirlpool of water
Awake and indifferent
Looking at cars go by and then get forgotten
Only a sound of the waterfall breathing out
And one long exhale
Rings in my ears for a moment

A sperate way of seeing
A seperate way of breathing it in
A lost world seperate from the usual barely meaningful waking and dreaming
Lost in an unfolding
Thinking about what to do with the day
And Sitting while the light dies
And Finally its over
In blue dusk I finally step outside
breathing in the cloud that has settled
