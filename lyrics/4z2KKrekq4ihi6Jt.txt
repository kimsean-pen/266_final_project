Moving without you
Moving without you
Loving without you
Loving without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Better without you
Better without you
Better without you

Everything is cool
I'm doing things my way
I packed up all my things
I'm headed down the highway
Every step I took
I took it on good ground
Every move I make
I always make it some how
I've been thru the storm
Been thru the rain
Suffered the hurt
Dealt with the pain
I used to say that I didn't' know what I would do without you
If I can make it without you
But I'm doing better without you

Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Baby I'm...
Loving without you
Loving without you
Loving without you
Loving without you
Loving without you
Loving without you
Happy
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Oh Better I'm...
Better without you
Better without you
Better without you
Better without you
Better without you
Better without you
I'm...

Pursuing all my goals
(And knowing what's best for me)
Living out my dreams

(Saw what's important to me)
My focus is on point
(And I can see clear now)
And everyday is a brighter day
(The darkness has died down)
I had some doubts
I cried some tears
Felt all alone
Faith crushed all my fears

I used to say that I didn't' know what I would do without you
If I can make it without you
But I'm doing better without you

Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
I'm...
Loving without you
Loving without you
Loving without you
Loving without you
Loving without you
Loving without you
I'm...
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
I'm...
Better without you
I'm...

I'm not reminiscing I am living
In this moment
I am moving
Forward cause the worse is far behind me
I am leaving the resentment
I'm releasing all the tension
Cause it's finally about me

Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Baby I'm...
Loving without you
Loving without you
Loving without you
Loving without you
Loving without you
Loving without you
Happy
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Oh Better I'm...
Better without you
Better without you
Better without you
Better without you
Better without you
Better without you
I'm...
