When your guy has got his hat
And made himself hard to find
It doesn't mean you should go crazy
It could be that way sometime

Find yourself another love
Who will treat you good and kind
Return that love he gives to you
It also be's that way sometime

Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does
Baby

When you think you've found a love
And you have peace of mind
Somebody else steals his heart
Yes, it also be's that way sometime

Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does, now
Baby, yes it does
Baby

Don't let the problems of this world
Drive you slowly out of your mind
Just smile, look at the problem
And say it be's that way, be's that way sometime

Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does, now
Baby, yes it does
Baby

I will be, also be that way sometime
Can also be that way, it also be's that way
Be's that way sometime
