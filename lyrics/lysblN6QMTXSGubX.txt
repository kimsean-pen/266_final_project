Set on fire like a paper plane
Falling down again, back to the start
I built you up just like a pack of cards
Walking separate paths into the dark

In time to voices
In time to voices

Twisting, turning like a Catherine Wheel
It burns through everything
Pulls you apart

A bleeding candle on a mantlepiece
The flicker reminds me
Beat of a heart

In time to voices
In time to voices

Closer, closer
Feeding the hunger
Closer, closer
Taking me over
How long, how long
Til I feel stronger
How long, how long
Slipping back under

In time to voices
In time to voices

Closer, closer
Feeding the hunger
Closer, closer
Taking me over
How long, how long
Til I feel stronger
How long, how long
Slipping back under

In time to voices
In time to voices
