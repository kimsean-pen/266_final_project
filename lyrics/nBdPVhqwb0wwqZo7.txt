Choose your disease, and get sick
it works every time, that's how to die
mercy you pulled us down
Look what you've done you
Left us here

mercy, mercy, show your tongue

----instrumental part-----

show your tongue, show your tongue
sever its head, sever its head

show the city dead, this mutilation
show the city in truth with us in the waters
