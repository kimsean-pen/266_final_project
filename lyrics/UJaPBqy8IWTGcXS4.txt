Follow the voice of your madness
And stay away from me
What do you think you are doing?
What you are trying to be?
Looking for nothing but trouble
I can already see
You going down to the ground
Begging on your knees!
I told you once, you had your chance
Now you're knocking at my door
You tried to take me for a fool
I won't be fooled no more
Running, and running in circles
It's all you seem to do
Hiding and fighting the memories
To live as you choose to
You lost everything you had
You can't believe it's true
I'll be laughing as you cry
Your payback is coming soon.
