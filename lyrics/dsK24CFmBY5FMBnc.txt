Burn like a cigarette
All inside my head
Reminding me not to forget
Words, words I'd never say
Things along the way
They're telling me that I'm the best
'Cause your face it doesn't look like it did
You give away everything now that you've hid

You, you wanna be only
To never get lonely
So you opened up your arms and took me in

And this our last goodbye
And this is a perfect lie
Told by someone that I used to know back then

Help, help is on the way
That's what they all say
But the thing that they don't know
Is I, I know everything
And maybe it's just a ring
But that won't make me let it go

Look at your face it doesn't look like it did
You give away everything now that your here

You, you wanna be only
To never get lonely
So you opened up your arms and let me in

And this our last goodbye
And this is a perfect lie
Told by someone that I used to know back then

Look at your face, it doesn't look like it did
You hide the love that you're not willing now to give
Willing now to give

You, you want to be only
To never get lonely
So you opened up your arms and let me in

And this is our last goodbye
And this is a perfect lie
Told by someone that I used to know back then

And this is our last goodbye
And this is a perfect lie
That I'll never have to hear that voice again
