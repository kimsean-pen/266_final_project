Well I got me a distant story
So I wrote me a distant tune
Of how they used to bask in the glory
And how I wished that I could too
Little man, be here tomorrow
They said they could change my ways
But instead they tried to stone me
And I been sleeping right here for a hundred days

Lying, giving in
Trying to get my day on through
Low town, going down
Ain't got nobody to save me

Now you know it's hard to stop
Getting down from burning up
Now you know it's hard to stop
Quit trying, baby
Just get somebody to save you

So I ran from here to El Paso
And arrived about half past June
Just in time for them to burn me
I think I woke up a little too soon
Little man, if you're a preacher
Oh then why you been looking so sad?
He struck a match and then he burned me
Another honest man gone bad

Lying, giving in
Trying to get my day on through
Low town, going down
Ain't got nobody to save me

Now you know it's hard to stop
Getting down from burning up
Now you know it's hard to stop
Quit trying, baby
Just get somebody to

Now you know it's hard to stop
Getting down from burning up
Now you know it's hard to stop
Quit trying, baby
Just get somebody to
