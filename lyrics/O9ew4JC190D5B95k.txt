Sexy hair, gorgeous smile
He's the most perfect guy I've come across in a while
Sensitive, real sweet
He even watches Desperate Housewives with me

My heart's beating like a mini drum
I told my best friends he's the one
I said I think that I'm in love this time
They told me something that could change my mind

He likes boys
Finally now it's all making sense
He likes boys
I like this guy, but he's on the fence
He likes boys
I can't believe this happened again
He likes boys
Oh-oh-oh, boys, oh-oh-oh

Manicured fingertips
He dresses like an American Apparel mannequin
Guess it is kind of odd
That he's such a big fan of Lady Gaga, ah

My heart's beating like a mini drum
I don't believe he would lead me o-on
But now I'm starting to see all the signs
Is it true? Have I lost my mind?

He likes boys
Finally now it's all making sense
He likes boys
I like this guy, but he's on the fence
He likes boys
I can't believe this happened again
He likes boys
Oh-oh-oh, boys, oh-oh-oh

He likes boys
Finally now it's all making sense
He likes boys
I like this guy, but he's on the fence
He likes boys
I can't believe this happened again
He likes boys
Oh-oh-oh, boys, oh-oh-oh

I don't think I could take this kind of rejection
I guess it's time to take it in
My gaydar needs some inspection
I felt him and me were the perfect we
I guess I'll move on to plan B
We both like vintage shopping
And we both like...

Boys
Finally now it's all making sense
We like boys
It's a love story, with a twist
We like boys
I found my new gay best friend
He likes boys
Oh-oh-oh, boys, oh-oh-oh

Boys

Oh-oh-oh, boys, oh-oh-oh
