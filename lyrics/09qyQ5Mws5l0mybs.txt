La-la-la-la-la-la-la

Impatient, waiting by the phone
When we going to start to do this?
('Cause tonight)
I don't want to be alone
Baby, I can't hold it in

Yeah

You don't have to be a superstar
Boy, I like you right where you are
I know this ain't no fly by night
I promise, if you were mine...

If I was your lover
I could blow your mind
I'm sick of waiting
So, come on, jump in my ride

If I was your lover
This could be sublime
Take you high and satisfy
If you were mine

If you come, I'll have to take the wheel
No more time to hurt today (I'm saying)
Just let me show you how I feel
Sit there, let's make a way

You don't have to be a superstar
Boy, I like you right where you are
I know this ain't no fly by night
I promise, if you were mine...

If I was your lover
I could blow your mind
I'm sick of waiting
So, come on, jump in my ride

If I was your lover
This could be sublime
Take you high and satisfy
If you were mine

What you waiting for?
Guess I'll have to get ready

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

And if you were mine!
If I was your lover
I could blow your mind
I'm sick of waiting
So, come on, jump in my ride

If I was your lover
This could be sublime
Take you high and satisfy
If you were mine

If I was your lover
I could blow your mind
I'm sick of waiting
So, come on, jump in my ride

If I was your lover
This could be sublime
Take you high and satisfy
If you were mine

If you were mine
If you were mine
Mmmm
I know you like me
