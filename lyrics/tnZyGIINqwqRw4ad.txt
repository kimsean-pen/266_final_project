If i could play the piano
I will write you a song
I'm a nice fellow
We could all get along
And impress all your friends
And your family
I'll impress all your friends
And your family
But It turns out
I don't know.
That much about anything...
At all...
That much about anything.
At all...
If i could play the piano
I will write you a song
And i could teach you
We can play along
We could be in a band
And travel the country
We could live in a van
Maybe just you and me
But It turns out
I don't know.
That much about anything...
At all...
That much about anything.
At all...
That much about anything.
At all...
That much about anything.
At all...
