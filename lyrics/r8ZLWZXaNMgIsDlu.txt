No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye

Knowing me, knowing you, ahaa
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, ahaa
We just have to face it, this time (this time,
This time we're through) we're through
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy
I know but I have to go (this time I have to go)
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do

Memories (memories), good days (good days), bad days (bad days)
They'll be (they'll be) with me (with me) always (always)
In these old familiar rooms children would play
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say

Knowing me, knowing you, ahaa
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, ahaa
We just have to face it, this time (this time)
(This time we're through) we're through
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy
I know but I have to go (this time I have to go)
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do

Knowing me, knowing you, ahaa
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, ahaa
We just have to face it, this time (this time)
(This time we're through) we're through
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy
I know but I have to go (this time I have to go)
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do
