This is a birthday pony
This is a strange kind of rest
Because i feel like a guest when I'm right here at home
I'm not right here at home
I opened up these accounts
All these separate accounts
Because I can't comprehend the single ride to the end
I needed something to do and so I split into two
But now the pattern takes hold
I find I'm losing control
Laugh boy
I don't want to be free
This is a birthday pony
