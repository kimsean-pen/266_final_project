No thoughts
No prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silenced
Are damned
The body count is on your hands

Smile for the camera
Another politician bought
I swear I heard another shot
Cash another payment
Red all on the canvas
There's murder on the campus
Another press conference
Nothing gets accomplished
The shooter's an accomplice
Money is the motive
The war is in the street
Watch history repeat

No thoughts
And no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent
Are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts
No prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent
Are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts
No prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent
Are damned
The body count is on your hands

Bow before the violence
It's a governmental shakedown
Welcome to my breakdown
Bulletproof backpacks
They wanna arm the teachers
I think I saw the reaper
Fear is good for profit
Deregulate the casket
They're lying to the masses
How much will it take?
Before you get buried in the coffin that you make, heaven's sake

No thoughts
And no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent
Are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts
No prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent
Are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts
No prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent
Are damned
The body count is on your hands

Turn off all the lights
Nobody make a sound
Ashes to ashes
We all fall down

Are we out of time when we turn this song around?
Are we out of time when we all fall
(When we all fall down)

On your hands
On, on your hands
On your hands
On your hands
The body count is on your hands

On your hands
On, on your hands
On your hands
On your hands
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts

The body count is on your hands
