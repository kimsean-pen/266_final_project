Look who's come back home again
Loser looking for his lucky break
This time he says he just needs a friend
Ain't on the run, he ain't on the take
Can you unlock this door, babe?

Will you just undo the chain?
Will you take your time before you
Mix up love, his love and pain?
Loneliness lays down his head

Wants to get you high, better take it now
A man like that's like an unmade bed
Stained eyes searching for another way out
Do you really even want this?

Maybe you just don't care
All I know, it takes just one kiss, babe
And for you, he's never there
Hey, I know it's kinda hard

And maybe this time it will never end
Hit and run lover back in your heart
Other's answered prayers you should never have sent
'Cuz now that you're in his arms babe
Know that you're just in his way
Suckered by his fatal charm, oh girl
It's time we get away
