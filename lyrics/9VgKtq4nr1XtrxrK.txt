Why are you thinking again little brother
When you know there's a story for every wrong
But I won't be around in the morning
Can only pray there's no harm in me moving on
To the trials in your unknown

Now there's a legion of walls in the forest
And while might have been lost, it is there, I know
And the crazy old names loving owners
I feel useless when I have to face alone
All your trials in my unknown

And if you could just walk home by
With signs just flying around
And if this storm was just a motion
Of your kid just trying out
If we could only lose these minds

Now there's a teribble light on the shade
Where you threw you insanity son I walk
I can see where the dark hits the summer
I said I believe you forever but you sit down
It's a child for all that grows

And if you could just walk home by
With sings just flying around
And if this storm was just a motion
Of your kid just trying out
If we could only lose these minds

Why are you drinking again little brother
When your haven's the hard part of loving you
You say the creeks and the falls want to drown you
But there are deeper wells where we going to
There's no drown in this unknown

And if you could just walk home by
With sings just flying around
And if this storm was just a motion
Of your kid just trying out
If we could only lose these minds

And when your memory is lost on the hillside
And the wind takes you further and forward now
Your world is a kite in the weather
Gently tight in the end that is pointed out
There's a sky in this unknown

And if you could just walk home by
With signs just flying around
And if this storm was just a motion
Of your kid just trying out
If we could only lose these minds
