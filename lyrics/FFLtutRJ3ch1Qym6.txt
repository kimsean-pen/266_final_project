Come loosen up, so hung up
Come count them ways to forever
Remember the winter gets cold in ways you always forget

Oh, you know... The rhythm and soul
Get your hands out your back pockets, boy let it go

Take another picture and you spring in the trap... Oh no, no
You miss home

You can't back this at your ride
Change of tide
And you're wise, you're wise

Short legs and square shoulders,
Pot holders, aching soldiers,
Your tank rollers, your all-overs

And you know, oh the rhythm and soul
Get your fingers moving their sockets

You're just the man
The one I saw in Kazan
Wonder what this book will throw... Oh no
The rhythm and...
