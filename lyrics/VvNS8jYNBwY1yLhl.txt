Can't you see
I gotta be me
Ain't nobody
Just like this
I gotta be me
Baby hit or miss

Sitting here
All by myself
Trying to be
Everybody else

Can't you see I gotta be me
Ain't nobody just like this
I gotta be me
Baby hit or miss

Look at you sitting there
All by yourself
Listening to everybody
Everybody saying be everybody else

Can't you see
You gotta be thee
Aint nobody
Just like you
You gotta be you
Baby hit or miss

Oh you see
I gotta be me
Ain't nobody
Just like this
I gotta be me
Baby hit or miss

Sitting here
I'm all by myself
I'm trying to be
Everybody else
But now I see
I gotta be me
Ain't nobody
Just like this
I gotta be me
Baby hit or miss
