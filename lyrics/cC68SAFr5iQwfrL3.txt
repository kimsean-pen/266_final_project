I'll open up my head awhile
It's been dead for years
I must have been a victim of my peers
One is for my happiness
The other for my health
The last is something bigger than myself

I ain't the only one...
I ain't the only one...
I ain't the only one to say

I'm talking to myself again
I'll just start a fight
Nobody can prove me wrong, I'm right
Anti-hero idol with a suicide excuse
A thousand other suckers will try and fill your shoes

I ain't the only one...
I ain't the only one...
I ain't the only one to say

I ain't the only one...
I ain't the only one...
I ain't the only one to say

Little pictures in my head are turning inside out again
'Cause fuckin' up takes practice
I feel I'm well rehearsed
Because the past is a bully and the futures even worse
You tell me what you fear
'Cause I can feel it like a curse

Well, you used to be a folk singer
Now you're just a joke singer
Ain't no smoking dope singer
Swinging from a rope singer

I ain't the only one...
I ain't the only one...
I ain't the only one to say
