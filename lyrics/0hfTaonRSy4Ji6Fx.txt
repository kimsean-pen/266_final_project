I knew a sick boy soldier
Who grinned at life
Slept soundly
Through the darkness
And whistled to the night
He comes from a town of normal
Which he is ashamed
People will remember him kindly
But no one remembers his name

It gets cold in the winter sometimes
It gets lost when the feeling ain't right
And mother can't sleep at night
She gets lost in the feeling
But her feeling ain't right

I knew a sick boy soldier
Who laughed at life
Slept soundly
Through the darkness
And whistled to the night
He comes from a town of normal
Which he is ashamed
People will remember him kindly
But no one remembers his name

It gets cold in the winter sometimes
It gets lost when the feeling ain't right
And mother can't sleep at night
She gets lost in the feeling
But her feeling ain't right
It gets cold in the winter sometimes(No no no)
It gets lost when the feeling ain't right(No no no)

And mother can't sleep at night
She gets lost in the feeling
Oh carry on
The ships and sails are gone
This place is falling down
Lord it's crumbling
It's crumbling to the ground
Oh carry on
The pirates and sailors have gone
This ship is sinking now

Lord it's crumbling
It's crumbling to the ground

It gets cold in the winter sometimes
It gets lost when the feeling ain't right
And mother can't sleep at night
She gets lost in the feeling
But her feeling ain't right

It gets cold in the winter sometimes(No no no)
It gets lost when the feeling ain't right(No no no)
And mother can't sleep at night
She gets lost in the feeling

It gets cold in the winter sometimes
It gets lost when the feeling ain't
And mother can't sleep at night
She gets lost in the feeling
But the feeling ain't right
