Georgia
You know that you've been on my mind
Georgia
We've both learned to compromise
I'll be there for you
When everybody's coming unglued
I'll be there for you
I won't say you have to choose

Yeah, 'cause I don't want to let you go
And I don't want to lose you slowly
And I just want to let you know
That it's only just a little back and forth lately

A little back and forth

Georgia
I'll be chasing you the rest of my life
Georgia, yeah
Welcome to the roller coaster ride
When I come to you
I know that you'll help me get through
I'll be there for you
We both know we could never choose

'Cause I don't want to let you go
And I don't want to lose you slowly
I just want to let you know
That it's only just a little back and forth
Yeah, it's only just a little back and forth lately

Yeah, you carry it like a heavyweight champ
It's hard to say I can't
But I know I can't be right there standing

Standing

Oh, 'cause I don't want to let you go
And I don't want to lose you slowly
'Cause I just want to let you know
That it's only just a little back and forth lately

Well, I could never let go
After all that you've been to me
I just want to let you know
That's it's only just a little back and forth
Yeah, it's only just a little back and forth lately

Lately
A little back and forth lately
A little back and forth
