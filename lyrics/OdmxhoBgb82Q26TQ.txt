Head below the surface of a frozen lake
Head in the black water, let it seep into my brain
God around your neck, though he never did too much for you
I wish I knew him better
Though I don't think there's much he'd wanna do

I'm not yours
Know when I mean it
I'm not wasted anymore

Tomorrow night's impatience and an endless perfect world
The morning bleeds into the golden dream just like before
Tomorrow I'll feel differently but my mind will be made up
Times that I could buy your love
Though I don't think that I'd have enough

I'm not yours
Know when I mean it
I'm not wasted anymore

Stupid, stupid me, me, me, me
