Lemon yellow afternoon
Gold azaleas in the front yard
But who, who have I lived for?
Yeah who, who have I lived for?

Pale blue mirror in the pool
You're courageous but you're not sure
And who, who have I lived for?
Yeah who, who have I lived for?

Growing darker every hour
Conversation going sour
Who, who have I lived for?
Yeah who, who have I lived for?

Now they're knocking at my front door
Ask you what, what have I lived for?
Yeah what, what have I lived for?

You wait for it to happen
Like it will fall into your lap
An unbreakable habit
A tidal wave but you're waving back
Maybe it's make-believe
You only see what you wanna see
It's whatever you make it
This is my wave to anchor
This is my wave to anchor
This is my wave to anchor

You wait for it to happen
Like it will fall into your lap
An unbreakable habit
A tidal wave but you're waving back
Oh maybe it's make-believe
You only see what you wanna see
You're thinking, are you thinking
This is my wave to anchor
