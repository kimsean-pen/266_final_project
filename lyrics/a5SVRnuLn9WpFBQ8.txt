I didn't mean to hurt you
So why did I let you walk out the door?
You say that you don't know me
You don't know who I am anymore
But if you knew the truth, then
Then you wouldn't feel insecure
'Cause if I didn't have you
I wouldn't have nothing at all

I wish you could see yourself through my eyes
I always forget that you can't read my mind
As long as I got you and me
We'll win through this world as a two-man team
I'll always have everything I need
You don't even realize what you mean
No one could fall for you quite like me
No one could get me so perfectly
You don't even realize
You're all that I need 'cause

I want you and me, you and me

I know one day we'll look back
Stories on the tip of our tongues
A library full of pages
Remembering when we fell in love
All of the broken hearts and the stupid mistakes
Have got us to where we are

It was worth all the pain
Yeah, we'll look back, we'll look back and laugh

As long as I got you and me
Move in through this world as a two-man team
I'll always have everything I need
You don't even realize what you mean
No one could fall for you quite like me
No one could get me so perfectly
You don't even realize
You're all that I need
'Cause I want you, you, you with
Me, me, me, together
Oh, I want you, you, you with
Me, me, me, forever
You and me, you and me

You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me

As long as I got you and me
Move in through this world as a two-man team
I'll always have everything I need
You don't even realize what you mean
No one could fall for you quite like me
No one could get me so perfectly
You don't even realize
You're all that I need
'Cause I want you, you, you with
Me, me, me, together (You and me, you and me)
Oh, I want you, you, you with
Me, me, me, forever (You and me, you and me)
