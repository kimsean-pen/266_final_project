Follow your common sense
You cannot hide yourself
Behind a fairytale forever and ever

Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose
The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever
Forever and ever

Indoctrinated minds so very often
Contain sick thoughts
And commit most of the evil they preach against

Don't try to convince me with messages from God
You accuse us of sins committed by yourselves
It's easy to condemn without looking in the mirror
Behind the scenes opens reality

Eternal silence cries out for justice
Forgiveness is not for sale
Nor is the will to forget

Follow your common sense
You cannot hide yourself
Behind a fairytale forever and ever

Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose
The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever
Virginity has been stolen at very young ages

And the extinguisher loses it's immunity
Morbid abuse of power in the Garden of Eden
Where the apple gets a youthful face, a youthful face
Eternal silence cries out for justice

Forgiveness is not for sale
Nor is the will to forget
Follow your common sense

You cannot hide yourself
Behind a fairytale forever and ever
Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose
The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever
Forever and ever
Eternal silence cries out for justice
Forgiveness is not for sale
Nor is the will to forget
You can't go on hiding yourself
Behind old fashioned fairy tales
And keep washing your hands in innocence
