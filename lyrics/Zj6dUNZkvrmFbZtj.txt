My men can not get out of being pulled in to the earth
I've been done here, only time keeps me from the demiurge
My self can not get out of being pulled in to the earth
Well we do next to next to nothing, we have always been in this cage

Come kill me, I see, so alone
Come kill me, I see, so alone
Come kill me, I see, so alone

My men can not get out of being pulled in to the earth
I've been done here, only time keeps me from the demiurge
My self can not get out of being pulled in to the earth
Well we do next to next to nothing, we have always been in this cage

Come kill me, I see, so alone
Come kill me, I see, so alone
Come kill me, I see, so alone
Come kill me, I see, so alone
