Down from my ceiling
Drips great noise.
It drips on my head through a hole in the roof

Behind these two hills here
There's a pool

And when I'm swimming
In through a tunnel
I shut my eyes

Inside their cabin
I make sounds
In through the tubes I send this noise.

Behind these two hills here
Fall asleep
And when i float in
Green grass of tunnel
It flows back

Down from my ceiling
Drips great noise
It drips on my head through a hole in the roof

Behind these two hills here
There's a pool

And when i'm swimming
In through a tunnel
I shut my eyes
