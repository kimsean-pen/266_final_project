I'm a steady rollin' man
I roll both night and day
I'm a steady rollin' man
I roll both night and day
But I haven't got no sweet woman
Boys, to be rollin' this-a way

I'm the man that rolls
When icicles is hangin' on the tree
I'm the man that rolls
When icicles is hangin' on the tree
And now you hear me howlin', baby
Down on my bended knee

I'm a hard workin' man
Have been for many years, I know
I'm a hard workin' man
Have been for many long years, I know
And some cream puff's usin' my money, ooh well, babe
But that'll never be no more

You can't give your sweet woman
Everything she wants in one time
You can't give your sweet woman
Everything she wants in one time
Well, boys, she get ramblin' in her brain
Some monkey man on her mind

I'm a steady rollin' man
I roll both night and day
I'm a steady rollin' man
And I roll both night and day
Well I don't have no sweet woman
Boys, to be rollin' this-a way
