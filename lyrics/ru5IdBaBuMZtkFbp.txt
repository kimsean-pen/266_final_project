I've changed the presets in my truck
So those old songs don't sneak up
But they still find me and remind me
Yeah, you come back that easy

Try restaurants I've never been to
Order new things off the menu
That I never tried, cause you didn't like
Two drinks in, you were by my side

I've talked to friends
Talked to myself
I've talked to God
I prayed liked hell
But I still miss you

I've tried sober, I've tried drinkin'
I've been strong, and I've been weak
And I still miss you

I've done everything
Move on like I'm supposed to
I'd give anything for one more minute with you
I still miss you
I still miss you, baby

I never knew 'til you were gone
How many pages you were on
It never ends
I keep turnin' and
Line after line you're there again

Well, I don't know how to let you go
You're so deep down in my soul
I feel helpless, so hopeless
It's a door that never closes
No, I don't know how to do this

I've talked to friends
Talked to myself
I've talked to God
I prayed liked hell
But I still miss you

I've tried sober, I've tried drinkin'
I've been strong, and I've been weak
And I still miss you

I've done everything
To move on like I'm supposed to
But I'd give anything for one more minute with you
I still miss you, yeah

I've talked to friends
Talked to myself
Talked to God
I prayed liked hell
But I still miss you

I've tried sober, I've tried drinkin'
I've been strong, and I've been weak
And I still miss you

I've done everything
To move on like I'm supposed to
But I'd give anything for one more minute with you
I still miss you
I still miss you
I still miss you, yeah
