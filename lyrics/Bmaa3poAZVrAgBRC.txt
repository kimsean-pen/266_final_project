Oh, she's an eight ball
She's a'rollin faster than a whitewall
She's got an avalanche packed in a snowball
She's losin' all the leeches like a stone wall
She's loaded up

She's the underdog
Gonna take a mighty swipe
At the high hog
While a'sippin on her tricks
In a thick fog
Makin' eyes at the girls like bullfrogs
I'm telling you, sir

She's comin' up from
Comin' up from, comin' up
Comin' up from behind

Yeah
She's comin' up from
Comin' up from, comin' up
Comin' up from behind

You'd like her hanging
Like a sneaker on a live wire, dangling
While your Wall Street pockets are jangling
With the hollow jackpot of your rich kid games

It's a long shot
She's got the truths and a tongue for a slingshot
But she's takin' steady aim
At the big shot
It's hard to miss the rolling bullets
On the blacktop
You better watch your turf

She's comin' up from
Comin' up from, comin' up
Comin' up from behind

Yeah
She's comin' up from
Comin' up from, comin' up
Comin' up from behind

You had her hanging
Like a sneaker on a live wire, dangling
While your golden-lined pockets were jangling
With the hollow jackpot of your wicked games

She caught your sick lie
It was creepin' in the shadow of your white smile
Lurkin' underneath the cover of your bedroom eyes
Well, you're greasin' up plans for your small-fry

You wanna talk it up, do you?
Well you're floatin like a royal balloon, oh
Your ego's swollen to the size of the moon, well
I think you found somebody to cut you down to size
Well, well

Yeah
She's comin' up from
Comin' up from, comin' up
Comin' up from behind

Yeah
She's comin' up from
Comin' up from, comin' up
Comin' up from behind

She's comin' up from
Comin' up from, comin' up
Comin' up from behind

Yeah
She's comin' up from
Comin' up from, comin' up
Comin' up from behind
