I like to learn things slow
I like learning alot
I like to get it on again and in the end
you know you get what you got
I like to mean what i say
But it don't always come through
'cause if i say it all again and again and again
It doesn't make it the truth

And the words are like the silence
And i'm like a secret
And i saw you lingering still, still
I saw you lingering still

It's all just news to me
Don't really care if it hurt
'cause if i knock it i'll know it
then i know that it will only get worse
He was different at first
But then he won't understand
Because he's never gonna know me
if he doesn't want to just shake my hand

And the words are like the silence
And i'm like a secret
And i saw you lingering still, still
I saw you lingering still

And the words are like the silence
And i'm like a secret
And i saw you lingering still, still
I saw you lingering still

And the words are like the silence
And i'm like a secret
And i saw you lingering still
I saw you lingering still
