Who doesn't know what I'm talking about
Who's never left home, who's never struck out
To find a dream and a life of their own
A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone

Many precede and many will follow
A young girl's dreams no longer hollow
It takes the shape of a place out west
But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed

She needs wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new faces
She knows the highest stakes

She traveled this road as a child
Wide-eyed and grinning, she never tired
But now she won't be coming back with the rest
If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test

She needs wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new faces
She knows the highest stakes
She knows the highest stakes

As her folks drive away, her dad yells, "check the oil"
Mom stares out the window and says, "I'm leaving my girl"
She said it didn't seem like a-that long ago
When she stood there and let her own folks know

She needed wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new faces
She knows the highest stakes
She knows the highest stakes
She knows the highest stakes
(Wide open spaces)
She knows the highest stakes
She knows the highest stakes
(Wide open spaces)
