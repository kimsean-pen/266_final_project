I read the news today oh boy
Terrorism
I'll never fly to israel
My doctor's telling me
Gotta stop partying
I'll never get out of bed

I need a quick lunch, ah
Pink litmus paper shirt
Saw fit
I need a chipmunk, ah
Pink litmus paper shirt

How's all my friends back home, who cares?
They know i'm not well
I'll never understand this world
There's no new girl, it's all a rumor
Not true not true
I'll never share romance again

I need a quick lunch, ah
Pink litmus paper shirt
Saw fit saw
I need a chipmunk, ah
Think if she'd pay for dirt
Is my watch fast?
