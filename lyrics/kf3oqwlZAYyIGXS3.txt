Comments and memories attached
And when there's no one there,
But the last moment
And I'll pray

So why can't you come around,
And why can't you watch the ground

And your green eyes turn to blue,
Your always, your always,
Begging for the truth

So why can't you come around
And --like a cheating dream--
And when the door slams open

My --?--
I'm holding the other now
And don't let the lights come down

And your green eyes turn to blue,
Your always, your always,
Begging for the truth

And your green eyes turn to blue,
Your always, your always,
Begging for the truth,
And you're begging for the truth

So why don't you come around
And you're always, you're always
So why can't you come around
And why can't you watch the ground

I'm holding the other now
You're always, you're always
And green eyes turn to blue
And green eyes turn to blue
And you're always, you're always
And you're always, you're always
Your green eyes turn to blue
Your green eyes turn to blue

And you're always, you're always
Your green eyes turn to blue
Your green eyes turn to blue

And you're always, you're always
And you're always, you're always
Your green eyes turn to blue
Your green eyes turn to blue
