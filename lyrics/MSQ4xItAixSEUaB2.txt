Turn me off, turn me on, like the vibrate on your phone
Call me up, wanna talk when you freeze me

It's the same when you're gone
Keep me guessing what you want
But my heart says it's you who can please me
I get pushed to extremes and I should know what it means
But I can't bare the game to be over
When your moods never change only got myself to blame
Cause I fall for it over and over

You're like my first bad habit
I can't live without it
I can't give you up give you up
And even though you're trouble I come back for double
I can't say enough is enough
I'm a part of you, You're a part of me
And I know it's wrong but I can't get free
You're like my first bad habit, how am I gonna give you up?

You're the worst, you're the best
Something diffrent from the rest
It's a fact seeing you is never easy

Love my style, hate my friends
No the conflict never ends
How much worse can it get when you tease me

And I know and I know and I know and I know the way we go around
Can't put my first bad habit down
And I know and I know and I know and I know the way we go around
I just can't give you up

You're like my first bad habit
I can't live without it
I can't give you up give you up
And even though you're trouble I come back for double
I can't say enough is enough
I'm a part of you, You're a part of me
And I know it's wrong but I can't get free
You're like my first bad habit, How am I gonna give you up?
