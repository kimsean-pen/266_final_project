Standing all alone in a deserted place, I wondered where the clouds were
As wind became stronger, I closed my eyes to what was coming there
Pushed and Tossed by an invisible force
Pitch black all around us
Something was falling from the sky
[Solo: Kevin/ Simon]
Crystal eyed flakes were floundering around
I don't know what they want, but I fear what they might find. In this world of misery
Crystal eyed flakes were floundering around
It is time to act in another direction, In this world of misery
[Solo: Simon]
Are we the chosen ones?
If so, did we respect life itself?
Are we the chosen ones?
We'll be deported to another world, where creatures like us are toys for them.
Standing in a humid place, where sorrows will surround us
My mates are crying their souls, cursing their brains.
Pushed and Tossed by visible corpses
A bright light is all around us.
