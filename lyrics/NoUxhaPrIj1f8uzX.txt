You hide you always hide
So deep inside the amethyst mine
The color bleeds and fades to white
What used to be a violent mind
Afraid the things they say
They reach and stranger get their way

Still you choose to take the edge of the room
Oooh time, it pulls out your eyes
It makes you choose between two lifes
So what, you've got that too
You're nobody's stupid girl
Mmmmm
