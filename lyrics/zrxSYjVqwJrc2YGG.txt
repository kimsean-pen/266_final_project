Is this a dream
I feel the earth beneath my feet
The Hunter is my name
Yes, I am the hunter
Push the button
Push the button
Push the button
Push the button
We force it down
Put on a play to hide our shame
No wonder we're in chains
Time to feed the hunger
Push the button
Push the button
Push it
Push the button
Push the button
Push the button
Push the button
Push the button
Push the button
Push the button
Push the button
