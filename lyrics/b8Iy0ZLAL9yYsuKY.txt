I'm not ashamed by the things I say
I'm doing fine when you're walking away
I'm getting tired of the games you play
And I'm doing fine when you're walking away

I'm doing fine, you're not on my mind
I'm doing fine, you're not on my mind
I'm doing fine, when you're not on my mind
I'm doing fine, when you're not on my mind

I'm out of time and my body can't stay
Since you've been gone its been happier days
Since you've left I'm not missing your face
And I'm doing fine when you're walking away

I'm doing fine, you're not on my mind
I'm doing fine, you're not on my mind
I'm doing fine, when you're not on my mind
I'm doing fine, when you're not on my mind

I'm doing fine, you're not on my mind
I'm doing fine, you're not on my mind
I'm doing fine, when you're not on my mind
I'm doing fine, when you're not on my mind

I'm doing fine, you're not on my mind
I'm doing fine, you're not on my mind
I'm doing fine, when you're not on my mind
Yeah, I'm doing fine, you're not on my mind
