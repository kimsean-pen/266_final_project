I fell deeper and deeper as light now was gone
I could feel the dark embrace my soul
Agony was no more, and so was pain
At this point of solitude I knew I was there...
There where I belong

Thus far a long journey through my soul's infinity
It has been a journey far beyond mortality
I have found what I wanted, tranquillity
I'll thrive on evil, eternally

I flew over crystal ground
My existence numb
Over orchards of grievance,
sorrow and tears
This beautiful silence...
calls me now
Black fog devours me but I can see it all
The monument of my past,
the land of seven horizons' before my eyes
I reach the land of spiritual rest

It's the dawn of descending
- I am the Somberlain
down to evil divine domain

Lord of infernal, gather my strength
Carry me through the gates

It's the dawn of descending
- I am the Somberlain
down to evil divine domain

For I'm eternal night
- I'm the Somberlain
Precede my evil divine domain
