Down at the arsenal they keep the nerve gasses
Guarded day and night by caged white rabbits
Been sitting there for years, I'm gonna have at it
I cut through the fence, run right in and grab it
Go crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy

Now I got my own mustard gas in my pocket
Climb on a tree on a branch and drop it
On a country club full of Saturday golfers
So I can watch them die chokin' shakin' in convulsions

Go crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy

Chemical warfare, chemical warfare
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare
Chemical warfare, chemical warfare
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare

Panic in the air, see the headless chickens runnin'
Golf carts head-on crashin' crackin' heads wide open
Scratch the grass, mister, you can't breathe
And roll and writhe in a sandtrap, starting to heave
Claw those clubs, lemme see you seethe

Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy

Chemical warfare, chemical warfare
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare
Chemical warfare, chemical warfare
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare

Yellow air
Yellow clouds
Blowin' down down down the fairway, sensitive to the touch
Mowin' down, down the putting green
Heading straight for the big clubhouse where

The stuffed country club
Effervescent ladies, so carefree
Relax, pose by the pool
Limber limp with a dry martini
Until...

Oh shit, what is going on in here?!

Chemical warfare, chemical warfare
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare
Chemical warfare, chemical warfare
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare
