Live from the funk
It's hotter than Texas
Right from the jump
You got my attention
You give me that stuff
And it's such a blessing
You and I in the light
Alone in this heaven

Aww baby, aww, aww baby
Say you will, say you might
If this is wrong then nothing's right
Aww baby, aww, aww baby
See yourself like I do
Oh tonight looks good on you

Hey, mysterious
We don't have to act so seriously
Like nobody's watching, only us
Baby if it feels good, then it must be
Bad how much I want you
Baby if it feels good, then it must be
Bad how much I want you

More than I choose to I'm falling in love
And love I ain't used to
You give me that stuff
No I can't refuse you
You and I in the light, it's alright

Aww baby, aww, aww baby
Say you will, say you might
If this is wrong then nothing's right
Aww baby, aww, aww baby
See yourself like I do
Oh tonight looks good on you

Hey, mysterious
We don't have to act so seriously
Like nobody's watching, only us
Baby if it feels good, then it must be
Bad how much I want you
Baby if it feels good, then it must be

Want you bad
More than bad
Want you bad
Want you bad
More than bad
So rock with me, girl

Oh, rock with me, girl

Hey, mysterious
We don't have to act so seriously
Like nobody's watching, only us
Baby if it feels good, then it must be
Bad how much I want you
Baby if it feels good, then it must be
Bad how much I want you
Baby if it feels good, then it must be, yeah
