Thought I was lying
I wasn't worth the time
But I learned more about you
just from the look in your eyes
And I was blind to
How you destroyed me
You have a talent
But you know that

Traitors are out now
Everything's darker
Your problems look so big from the ground
Raise them up for all to see
Shout them out from top of twin peaks

We're just nervous kids
We're just

Thought I was lying
I wasn't worth the time
We're just nervous kids
We're just over it
We're just nervous kids
We're just over it
