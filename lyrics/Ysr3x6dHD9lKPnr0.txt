It was right before my eyes
There were a thousand other guys
In synthicide

I've been caught on a one way street
In the big electronic beat
In synthicide

Give me a break, it's a tricky situation
Don't give it all away
I gotta have my digital fix today

I'm out of phase
Help me, I'm falling, losing my place
Is that you calling crimson and ice
Feeling no pain
Synthicide!

It's on program eighty-eight
Duel mode arpeggiate
Synthicide

It's like clockwork out of sync
A memory to help you think
Synthicide

Give me a break, it's a tricky situation
Don't give it all away
I gotta have my digital fix today

I'm out of phase
Help me, I'm falling, losing my place
Is that you calling crimson and ice
Feeling no pain
Synthicide!

It was right before my eyes
There were a thousand other guys
In synthicide

It's like clockwork out of sync
And the memory makes you drink
Synthicide

Synthicide
Synthicide
Synthicide
In synthicide
Synthicide

Synthicide...
Synthicide...
Synthicide...
