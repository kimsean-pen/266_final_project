Stepped out up on the water
My heart couldn't be any further from you
You slept it but I was a gonner
With your voice you make everything calmer anew
Eh ah
So why do the fishes come in towards you, you
Eh ah
Maybe in the furnish I know that it's worth it
I want you, you

One love is this
One, one, one, one love
It's something else
One, one, one, one love
Don't it make sense
One, one, one, one love
It's something else
One, one, one, one love
