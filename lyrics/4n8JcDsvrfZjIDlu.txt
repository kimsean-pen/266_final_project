Remember when we all got drunk
I ended up with two broke thumbs
Oh my God I felt so dumb, lucky me
I wrote a song and no one knows
I played a show and no one showed
Oh my God I felt so alone, lucky me

When all is going wrong and you're scared as hell
What you gonna do, who you gonna tell?

Maybe a...
100 bad days made a 100 good stories
A 100 good stories make me interesting at parties

A 100 bad days made a 100 good stories
A 100 good stories make me interesting at parties
Yeah, no I ain't scared of you
No I ain't scared of you no more (la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
No I ain't scared of you
No I ain't scared of you no more

Remember when she broke my heart
Waitin' for the waiter to return my card
Right as I let down my guard
Lucky me
We had to work a bit more hard
Only just to get a little bit less far
We could laugh about it all tomorrow, couldn't we

When all is going wrong and you're scared as hell
What you gonna do, who you gonna tell?

Maybe a...
100 bad days made a 100 good stories
A 100 good stories make me interesting at parties

A 100 bad days made a 100 good stories

No I ain't scared of you no more

No I ain't scared of you
No I ain't scared of you no more

(Do your thing it goes like this)

No I ain't scared of you
No I ain't scared of you
A 100 bad days made a 100 good stories
