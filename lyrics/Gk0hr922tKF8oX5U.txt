I, can fly
You had me caged up like a burning red summer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, I'm fire awaiting to fly
I, can fly

I had pride, wishes in the summer, I was bathing in sunlight,
Painting in the garden, like a ghost in meteor light,
Running fast from something with my eyes wide, like so suspended in the sun

I had a dream that I was fine,
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

I, can fly,
You had me caged up like a burning red summer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, I'm fire awaiting to fly
I, can fly

Your lies were hard, kisses in the summer
I was dreaming of a lake, dreaming of the water where I'd rise like a phoenix
Sore and iron from the fire, I've got things to tell you, like, I know that you're a liar

I had a dream that I was fine,
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

I, can fly,
You had me caged up like a burning red summer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, I'm fire awaiting to fly
I, can fly

Your words cut like a knife in butter
I was fighting for my art, fighting with my lover
Thinking there's no water
Yeah, right
Yeah, right

I, can fly,
You had me caged up like a burning red summer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, I'm fire awaiting to fly
I, can fly
