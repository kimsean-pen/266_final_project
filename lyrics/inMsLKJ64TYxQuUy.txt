Smoking by the hunna tree
Talking how we used to be
What we were told was just a dream
By all of them
But I'm sure they see what I can see cause I can see that

You (ooh) and me (eee)
We are wild and we are free
You (ooh) and me (eee)
We were meant to be

Underneath the fallen leaves
Not just a band, a family
That they can't take away from me
That they can't take away

You (ooh) and me (eee)
We are wild and we are free
You (ooh) and me (eee)
We were meant to be

You (ooh) and me (eee)
Smoking by the hunna tree
You (ooh) and me (eee)
We were meant to be

They people sing, they're listening
And they'll believe what we could be
And I'm sure they see what I can see cause I can see that
And I'm sure they see what I can see cause I can see that

You (ooh) and me (eee)
We are wild and we are free
You (ooh) and me (eee)
We were meant to be

You (ooh) and me (eee)
Smoking by the hunna tree
You (ooh) and me (eee)
We were meant to be

You (oooh)
And me (eee)
Smo (ooh) king

You (oooh)
And me (eee)
We (eee) were meant to be
