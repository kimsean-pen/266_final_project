Touch the ceilin', act like how ya feelin'
Gonna rock it ‘till the wheels comes off
And keep it reelin'
No mistakin', people shakin'
And soon we're gonna break it
‘Till the last one stands because they can't take it

Touch the ceilin', act like how ya feelin'
Gonna rock it ‘till the wheels comes off
And keep it reelin'
No mistakin', people shakin'
And soon we're gonna break it
‘Till the last one stands because they can't take it

The rush is like nothing
It gets your blood pumpin'
When you flip the switch, it comes on
It'll trail you, derail you
Hammer and nail you
To the point where you need to explode

Let's put the pedal to the floor
Here it comes, lets go
Wind it up and let it go
We're gonna watch it blow

If you want it, then we got it
We won't let up, ‘till we get enough
Adrenaline overload
If you need it, then we bleed it
Make some room, here comes the boom!
Adrenaline overload

And we won't let it off
There's nothin' that can stop it
Until we're in the coffin
If you want it, we got it
So let's get it started
Adrenaline overload

Touch the ceilin', act like how ya feelin'

No mistakin', people shakin'
And soon we're gonna break it
‘Till the last one stands because they can't take it

It will stop at nothin'
To make you feel somethin'
‘Till you feel like that's what you need
But proceed with caution
‘Cause you can get lost
And not everything is what it seems

Let's put the pedal to the floor
Here it comes, lets go
Wind it up and let it go
We're gonna watch it blow

If you want it, then we got it
