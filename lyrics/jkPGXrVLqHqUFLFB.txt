Walk in with a dead bitch and a Swisher lit
Drug kit
Got a half hit worth of acid
Can't quit I'm an addict
So traumatic And I'm manic
Feeling panicked I need a Xanax
Pass it as I OD real slowly
Lonely looking ghostly surrounded by
smoky mirror images of a fictionist sober me
Don't give a fuck about harming me
I'm drugging till I R.I.P

Take a hit of acid been a while since I tripped
Now I'm seeing all this shit
Brain glowing
Everything is bending in the same motion
Roll the blunt I'll take a hit
Start staring at the smoke as it twists and disappears
Peer pressure don't affect me bitch I take drugs on my own
Pop a Perc and snort some coke
It feel like my heart is broke
because I get fucked up when I feel alone
I'm choking on this 40 of OE
I'm hoping that I don't breath
Bitch I'm dope act like you know me
Shoot me up so I can OD
