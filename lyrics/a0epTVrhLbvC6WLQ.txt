There we were thick as thieves
Frightened by shadows and the autumn leaves
We wore stolen hats, fitted soles
Aided by lies amongst the media foes

And hey oh, where did it go?
When did we lose our sight?
And it's a nice show, the ones we perform
Performing it day and night, night

See the lights upon my face
Walking in circles with the human race
And all the little people they want to be free
But I can't get there 'cause I've got you holding me back

And hey oh, where did it go?
When did we lose our sight?
And it's a nice show, the ones we perform
Performing it day and night, night
Let me be free

Gave you all the high skies but you gave me night
I gave you all the high skies but you gave me night
I gave you all the high skies but you gave me night
I gave you all the high skies but you gave me night
Let the lights sing again
There we were thick as thieves
Frightened by shadows and the autumn leaves
Goodbye my sweet, goodbye, goodbye
