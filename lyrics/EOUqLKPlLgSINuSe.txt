I had to escape
The city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first
But I was dying to get to you
I was dreaming while I drove
The long straight road ahead, uh uh yeah

Could taste your sweet kisses
Your arms open wide
This fever for you
Is just burning me up inside

I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright?
I drove all night, crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright? I drove all night

What in this world
Keeps us from falling apart?
No matter where I go, I hear
The beating of our one heart
I think about you
When the night is cold and dark, uh uh yeah

No one can move me
The way that you do
Nothing erases this feeling
Between me and you

I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright?
I drove all night, crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright? I drove all night

I taste your sweet kisses
Your arms open wide
This fever for you
Is just burning me up inside

I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright?
I drove all night, crept in your room
Is that alright? I drove all night
