There is nothing in my heart, that is how i love you
There is nothing in my heart, that is how i hate you
There is nothing in my heart, that is why i hold you
There is nothing in my mind, that is what i think of you

This is a song for hate and devotion
For all of you, who mean nothing to me

There is nothing in my heart, that is how i love you
There is nothing in my heart, that is how i hate you
There is nothing in my hand, that is what i give you
There is nothing in my mouth, that is what i speak of you

This is a song for hate and devotion
For all of you, who mean nothing to me

There is nothing in my heart, that is how i love you
There is nothing in my heart, that is how i hate you
There is nothing in my eyes, that is how i see you
There is nothing in my soul, that is what i feel for you

This is a song for hate and devotion
For all of you, who mean nothing to me
