They'll never find a happy hope for you,
But know that's not the only only chance you'll get, yeah you'll see

Still the celebration haunts
Today I heard it on the radio
You've gone and found a way to get me out from this place
Soldiers on the waterfront
They wanna ship me far away
I'll find my way out tonight so I can find my way to you
