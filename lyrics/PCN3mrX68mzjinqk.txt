With this I'm scraping by
At least it's cute that I try
I wrote some songs that I sung
And have you heard I am so young
So young
I heard about being young
But I'm not sure how it's done
Thought I heard a mumble
Something about fun
Fun
Fun
Easy for you to say I say
I say this to you every day
Easy for you to say
The sky is a special warring streak
Between balloons to moons
A leak of light in a blue town like this
The clouds are (?) sky a kiss
That never shows or comes-so what
Away sits in the parking lot
I just wanna be alive that's it
Alive
Alive
