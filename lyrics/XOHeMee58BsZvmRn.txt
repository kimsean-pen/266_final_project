She said live young and leave a wake of beauty
It's all I ever could have asked
Should have asked from you

And I won't forget to write you when I get there soon
'Cause you'll be lying dead
From stab wounds to the neck and chest again

(They found you covered up in blood)
(Covered head to toe in blood)
Face first in a tale of awkward love
(They found you covered up in blood)
She's bleeding, she's bleeding

Gone with the stitching in her heart
Left out a silhouette that just won't heal
And dying in your arms tonight

This dream, we die
(Locked away)
This blood, this knife
This dream, we die
(Locked away)
This blood and this knife
I know it's all just a bad dream, now

So now midnight's here, you're all alone
They use this fear, it's all just a bad dream
And I can't seem to wake up from this

Midnight's here, you're all alone
They use this fear, it's all just a bad dream
And I can't seem to wake up from this

In my dreams, we die
This blood, this knife
In my dreams, we die
This blood, this knife

And I know it's all just a bad dream, now
(It's all just a bad dream, now)
It's all just a bad dream, now
(It's all just a bad dream, now)
It's all just a bad dream, now
(It's all just a bad dream, now)

I say, this is the last time
That I'll ever get to see your face alive
(They found you covered up in blood)
(Covered head to toe in blood)

And I know that every day's a new day
And my dreams will never die
(They found you covered up in blood)
(Covered head to toe in blood)

She said live young and leave a wake of beauty
It's all I ever could have asked
Should have asked from you

And I won't forget to write you when I get there soon
'Cause you'll be lying dead from dreaming
(Nightmares)

So now midnight's here, you're all alone
They use this fear, it's all just a bad dream
And I can't seem to wake up from this

Midnight's here, you're all alone
They use this fear, it's all just a bad dream
And I can't seem to wake up from this

Midnight's here, you're all alone
They use this fear, it's all just a bad dream
And I can't seem to wake up from this nightmare
