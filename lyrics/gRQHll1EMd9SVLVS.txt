They say they want the old me, but im on new shit
Same old jeans, thousand dollar jacket
I don't want my heart, you can have it
I fell in love with a bad bitch
Kissin' on my tattoos, in a jaguar
Love hurts and i know you have a few scars
Let my love heal you, i just wanna feel you, i wanna know the real you
I don't pop xans, i don't drink lean, you're my drug
Countin' up bands, in a foreign car, im finna pull up (yeah)
Does she love me, or does she love me not?
She told me that im pretty, i ain't get that a lot
Doin' donuts in a parking lot
You're mines, whether you like it or not
