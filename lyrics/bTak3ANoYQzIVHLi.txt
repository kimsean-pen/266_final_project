They've got good hearts
With a burning desire
To work hard
They don't even get tired
Never try to get a taste of the spotlight
No, they only wanna make Santa shine bright
Uh (uh)

In the workshop
Making cookies and candy
With Mrs Claus
While Santa's sippin' brandy
And they don't even mind that it's so cold
'Cause they love living life in the North Pole
Uh (uh uh uh)

Let's give a cheer for the elves
They do like nobody else
Working all day and all night
To make your wish come alive
Making dolls, making trains, making model airplanes
Helping Santa with a smile on their face
Let's give a cheer for the elves (hey)
A cheer for the elves

In the mailroom
They read every letter
That was sent through
And no matter the weather
They always make sure Santa gets out
And he gets every single last gift out
Uh (uh uh uh)

Let's give a cheer for the elves
They do like nobody else
Working all day and all night
To make your wish come alive
Making dolls, making trains, making model airplanes
Helping Santa with a smile on their face
Let's give a cheer for the elves (hey)
A cheer for the elves

Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la

Making dolls, making trains, making model airplanes
Helping Santa with a smile on their face
Let's give a cheer for the elves (hey)
A cheer for the elves

Let's give a cheer for the elves
