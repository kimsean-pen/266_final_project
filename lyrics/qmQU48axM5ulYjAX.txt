I'll always think of you
Inside of my private thoughts
I can imagine you
Touching my private parts
And just the thought of you
I can't help but touch myself
That's why I want you so bad

Just one night of
Moonlight, with you there beside me
All night, doin' it again and again
You know, I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Ohh, I get so high
When I'm around you, baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise
Baby, you're makin' me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Can't get my mind off you
I think I might be obsessed
The very thought of you
Makes me want to get undressed
I wanna be with you
Inspite of what my heart says
I guess I want you too bad

All I want is
Moonlights, with you there inside me
All night, doin' it again and again
You know, I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Ohh, I get so high
When I'm around you, baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise
Boy, you're makin' me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby

I want to feel your heart and soul inside of me
Let's make a deal you roll, I lick
And we can go flying into ecstasy
Oh, darlin' you and me
Light my fire, blow my flame
Take me, take me, take me away
Yeah, yeah

Well all I only want is
Moonlights, with you there inside me
All night, doin' it again and again
Baby, I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I get so high
When I'm around you, baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise
You're makin' me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I get so high
