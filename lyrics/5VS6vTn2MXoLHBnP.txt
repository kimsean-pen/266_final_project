Someone always gets their heart stomped to the ground
This is what I see, everytime I look around.
I never thought that this would happen to me.
I never thought I'd end up this way.
And now that you're through with me,
Don't know what to do with me
I guess I'm on my own again
Like I'm some kind of enemy
Never a friend to me
Remember when you used to say
Things will always be this way

Why don't you break my heart?
Watch me fall apart
You see, I'm falling apart
Look what you're doing to me

Now I try to get my heart up off the ground
My confidence is gone, happiness cannot be found
So look what you did to me
You got the best of me
And now I'm stuck with all the rest
It will never be the same

Why don't you break my heart?
Watch me fall apart
You see, I'm falling apart
Look what you're doing to me

Break my heart
Watch me fall apart
You see, I'm falling apart
Look what you're doing to me

All I ever wanted
Has left me standing here alone
It started with you and ended with me
All I ever needed
I had it with you in my arms
It started with you and ended with me

Break my heart
Watch me fall apart
You see, I'm falling apart
Look what you're doing to me

Why don't you break my heart?
Watch me fall apart
You see, I'm falling apart
Look what you're doing to me
Why don't you break my heart?
Watch me fall apart
You see, I'm falling apart
Look what you're doing to me
Why don't you break my heart,
Break my heart,
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
