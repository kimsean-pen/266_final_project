Ah-ahahahah (ahah ahah)
Ahahahah
Ah-ahahahah (ahah ahah)
Ahahahah

Now it's too late, I can see that we should not be together
Now it's too late, we've gone too far and we should not be together
Destructive, disruptive not conductive
Can't you see where we went wrong?
Now it's too late, I can see that we should not be together

Ah-ahahahah ahah ahah

Take back my life, take back my heart
I know I can hold it together
Give back my life, give back my heart
I know we can hold us together

Enlightening, enlightening
When we're not fighting, we're not fighting
Can't you see we should get along
It's not too late, I can see I know we can hold it together

When we get along, we're really strong, we're really strong
When we get along, we're really strong, we're really strong
Conduct yourself, conduct yourself
Conduct yourself, conduct yourself
Conduct yourself (when we get along), conduct yourself
Conduct yourself (we're really strong, we're really strong), conduct yourself
