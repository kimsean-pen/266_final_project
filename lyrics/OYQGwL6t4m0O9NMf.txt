You said I wouldn't survive without your controlling, controlling
I can't stop reliving your lies cause I took them all in, all in

How can you say that you care?
Leave me in pain with nothing left falling, I'm falling
Yeah it came out of nowhere, most nights alone in my head bawling
I was bawling

Now it's me in control, it's you on your own
How dare I, you can't deny I'm proving you wrong
It won't go unnoticed, it won't go unknown
How dare I, you can't deny I'm proving you wrong

You said I wouldn't survive and I'd just fade slowly, slowly
But I've never felt more alive now you don't own me, own me

Left me in chains, both hands tied
How do you even sleep at night, knowing, just knowing

Now it's me in control, it's you on your own
How dare I, you can't deny I'm proving you wrong
It won't go unnoticed, it won't go unknown
How dare I, you can't deny I'm proving you wrong

There's no point in lying now
Cause everyone knows
There's no place to hide it out

Now it's me in control, it's you on your own
How dare I, you can't deny I'm proving you wrong
It won't go unnoticed, it won't go unknown
How dare I, you can't deny I'm proving you wrong

It's me in control, it's you on your own
How dare I, you can't deny I'm proving you wrong
Now it's me in control
How dare I, you can't deny I'm proving you wrong
