Tonight I'm free, so free
For the first time
I've seen a new life, new life
Start to breathe

And you came to me
In some way
And my life

Will never be the same
(And one day you'll feel me
A whisper upon the breeze)
And that night
As I dreamed
And I slipped away

To another place
Where you spoke to me

Of this day
Of this day
And you came to me

In some way
And my life
Will never be the same
And you came to me
In some way
And my life
Is like a hurricane
And you came to me
In some way
And my life
Will never be the same
For you're mine
And I'm yours
For life
For you're mine
And I'm yours
For life
For life
The fear is just a illusion
The fear is just a illusion
The fear is just a illusion
The fear is just a illusion
