It's far beyond your reach
It holds a place in time
Somewhere ahead is the back of the line
I can't relate to your mistakes
Awkwardly speaking with nothing to say

Caught up in your life, excuses are so lame
You may be different, but I'm still the same
The reasons that you thought, the attention that you caught
You say things are simple we both know they're not
You can't let it go

Wwhhooooaaaaa
You can't but i know
Wwhhooooaaaaa
Wwhhooooaaaaa
You don't even know

It's not in what you do, more in what you say
It's not in what you do, more in what you say
It's not in what you do, more in what you say
It's not in what you do, what you do

A million questions asked, the remnants of the past
You've always been denied, but I was by your side
I've always tried to, to understand you
The world's not learning from you

Wwhhooooaaaaa
Wwhhooooaaaaa

It's not in what you do, more in what you say
It's not in what you do, more in what you say
It's not in what you do, more in what you say
It's not in what you do, what you doooo
