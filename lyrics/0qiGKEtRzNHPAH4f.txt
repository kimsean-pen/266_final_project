Eyes closed
Breathe in slowly
Meet you on the river floor
Undertow carries us sweetly
Repose so permanent

Dizzy in this love
Buried by the flood
Our names on the same stone
Blue-eyed beacon, guide me home

Revel in the afterglow
Love like ivy grows
You found me tangled deep
Now we're drifting in this reverie
Reeling slowly

Dizzy in this love
Buried by the flood
Our names on the same stone
Blue-eyed beacon, guide me home

Dizzy in this love
Buried by the flood
Our names on the same stone
Blue-eyed beacon, guide me home
