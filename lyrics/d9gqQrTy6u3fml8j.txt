Wait for waves, sounds of other days, waiting, hoping, is all I want to say.
Dreamed of far, bright-lit stars, standing here never felt like it did that day.

Slept for days, thought of all the ways to warm the cold soften the blows anything to stay.
But it takes so much time it's like waiting for the sun to shine, holding you close never felt the way it did today.

Think I'm losing hold. The world that I loved has gone
You're lost tonight, lost in the darkened sky.
