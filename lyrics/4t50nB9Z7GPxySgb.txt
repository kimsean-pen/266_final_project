The first steps I took when I was younger
They fell to the ground
I waited so long, I finally went
But half of me is half of you
I runaway so you would know
And half of me is half of you
I wanna know where to go
You're everything I left behind
You're everything that I can't find
It's a mountain in the hole, mountain in our hearts
It's a mountain in the hole, mountain in our hearts
Feel so cold and you saw rushing
It's the battle you fell when you saw me blowing
But half of me is half of you
I runaway so you would know
And half of me is half of you
I wonder why I let you go
You're everything I left behind
You're everything that I can't find
It's a mountain in the hole, mountain in our hearts
It's a mountain in the hole, mountain in our hearts
Half of me is half of you
I wanna know
If half of me is half of you
You're everything I left behind
You're everything that I can't find
It's a mountain in the hole, mountain in our hearts
It's a mountain in the hole, mountain in our hearts
