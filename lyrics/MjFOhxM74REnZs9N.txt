My heart beats in patters to the broken sound
You're the only one that can calm me down
My head spins in circles so I'm dizzy now
All of this time I should've figured it out

I'm a free animal, free animal

I'm a free animal, free animal

Free animal, free animal
My heart beats in patters to the broken sound
Free animal, free animal
You're the only one that can calm me down

You get what you came for, what you stayed for
I only know how to satisfy your craving
This is what you crave
Know what you're made of, what you're made of
Flesh and bones won't lie
They won't lie

Free animal, free animal
My heart beats in patters to the broken sound
Free animal, free animal
You're the only one that can calm me down

Free animal, free animal
My heart beats in patters to the broken sound
Free animal, free animal
You're the only one that can calm me down

You're the only one that can calm me down

You're the only one that can calm me down

Free animal, free animal
My heart beats in patters to the broken sound
Free animal, free animal
You're the only one that can calm me down
Free animal, free animal
My heart beats in patters to the broken sound
Free animal, free animal
You're the only one that can calm me down
