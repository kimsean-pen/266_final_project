Don't you think it's time for you and me to make some history
Tell me now what you say cause we can take anything
Just because we're growing up, it doesn't mean we've had enough
When times are hard we'll smile and say we're not afraid of anything
(cause we feel young and wild)
I believe that I can make you scream
For me

Help me see everything we used to be
We won't forget
The lives we lived, the loves we chased
We lost the things we can't replace
(when we were young and wild)
I believe that I can make you scream
For me
