I've had my eyes on you for awhile and though
it seems the time isn't right I know
you want the love that I've got to give

we laughed and kissed til the sun took us by surprise
telling the whole truth about our lives
I'm so in love with that you've got to give

I can show you that love is the cure for heartache
let me show you baby, don't be afraid of a good thing
I can show you that love is the cure for heartache

you think your heart needs to hurt for awhile longer
live all alone til it makes you stronger
learn who you are without her love

I know, I've been there before but I won't wait
for a love like yours I can't hesitate
stay awhile and let me change your mind

I can show you that love is the cure for heartache
let me show you baby, don't be afraid of a good thing
I can show you that love is the cure for heartache
