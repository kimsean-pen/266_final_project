It happened in December
In the days when things get sad for no reason
Strangers share a drink called loneliness
And this city turns into the coldest place
Then I keep you in mind from time to time
I resist to scream your name out loud
I'm sorry I gave you everything I had
Without making sure you ever desired it...

People get tired of being sad, being pushed aside
And then they leave, even though they promised they would not
And it's not as if I did not try,
but somewhere between being who you needed
And being who I should become, I became a stranger to us both

Teach your heart how to cherish the
people around you before they depart
You know they surely will, if not by a choice, death steals them away
And you'll have the remains of your life to dwell in regrets
Cause the gallows won't disappear, and for sure the graves won't fill
...and for sure the graves won't fill...

This is the death of our youths
The requiem to our dreams
Almost thirty summers passed
And dropped down on me like fallen leaves
No, we didin't even ask for happiness... just a little less pain
Now we sing and drink besides the graves we've dug

Perhaps one day we will meet again
Two stars colliding for another time
Recognizing the pieces of ourselves
We left behind in each other's heart
So search for me in the pitch black night
When the stars hide behind the clouds
And my heart longs for you
Whatever you do... search for me

Steal my heart in autumn, where I fall in love by time
We roam the fields together, counting stars and fighting sleep
No, I'm not feeling better yet, it seems I just got used to the words
Cause the gallows won't disappear,
and for sure the graves won't ever fill

This was the death of our youths
This was the requiem to our dreams
Almost thirty summers passed
And dropped down on me like fallen leaves
No, we didn't even ask for happiness, no, just a little less pain
This is where we sing and drink besides the graves we've dug...
...besides the graves we've dug...
