I knitted you a hat all blue and gold
To keep your ears warm from the Binghamton cold
It was my first one and it was too small
It didn't fit you at all but you wore it just the same

I remember the first time we danced
I remember tunneling through the snow like ants
What I don't recall is why I said
I simply can't sleep in this tiny bed with you anymore

I should tell you
That you were my first love

So it's Christmas time, it's been three years
And someone else is knitting things for your ears
As I have come to know I'll only see you
Interrupting my dreams at night

And that's alright and that's alright
And that's alright and that's alright

I should tell you
That you were my first love

And it's alright and it's alright and it's alright
And it's alright, we were seventeen again together
And it's alright, we were seventeen again together
And it's alright, we were seventeen again together

I should tell you
That you were my first love
I should tell you
That you were my first love

We were seventeen again
We were seventeen again
We were seventeen again
