The killer song, the song
Of underground

I Love
The killer song, the song
Of underground
I Love
The killer song, the song
Of underground

The king of the night
He feels me with delight
He's sexy and crazy
His song stop and he's mine
He's a deejay in my dreams
He's a king and I'm a queen
We love each other in the dark and push
Play or stop
La la lalala
La la lalala
Lalalala lalala lalalala lalala
