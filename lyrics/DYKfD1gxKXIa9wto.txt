Early in the mornin' and I can't do right
Had a little fight with my baby last night
And it's early in the mornin'
Don't you know it's early in the mornin'?
Early in the mornin'
I ain't got nothin', no nothin' but the blues

I went to your girlfriend's house but she was out
I knocked on your daddy's door but he began to shout
And he said "It's early in the mornin'
Don't you know it's early in the mornin'?"
Early in the mornin'
I ain't got nothin', no nothin' but the blues

I went to Dooby Chase to get somethin' to eat
Waitress looked at me said, "Harry, you sure look beat"
I said "It's early in the mornin'
Don't you know it's early in the mornin'?"

Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'

I ain't got nothin' but the
Ain't got nothin' but
Ain't got nothin' but the
Ain't got nothin' but the
Ain't got nothin' but the
Ain't got nothin' but the blues

Early in the mornin' and I can't do right
Had a little fight with my baby last night
And it's early in the mornin'
Don't you know it's early in the mornin'?
