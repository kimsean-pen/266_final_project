In the cool of the evenin' when evErything is gettin' kind of groovy
I call you up and ask you if you'd like to go with me and see a movie
First you say "No", you've got some plans for the night
And then you stop, and say, "All right"
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you.
You always keep me guessin',
I never seem to know what you are thinkin'
And if some fellow looks at you,
it's for sure your little eye will be a-winkin'
I get confused, 'cause I don't know where I stand
And then you smile, and hold my hand
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you
Spooky! Spooky! Yeah - yeah
If you decide someday to stop this little game that you are playin'
I'm gonna tell you all that my heart's been a-dyin' to be sayin'
Just like a ghost, you've been a-hauntin' my dreams
So I'll propose... on Halloween.
Baby, love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you
Ah, Spooky!
