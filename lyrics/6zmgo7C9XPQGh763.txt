Oh, comfort me brother
Something's heavy on my mind
Now I sit and wonder
What it is it that I can't find,
Can't find peace all on my own
Can't seem to get there on and on
So come, hear me brother, I won't lie!

Now I have been broken
No longer am I blind
My lesser has spoken and
Most of me is left behind
Won't find freedom here on my own
Can't seem to get there all alone
So come, hear me brother, I won't lie!

You never leave me
You'll always be part of the person I'll become
And I'll never leave you
You give me memories that I know could never leave
Oh, yeah!

You never leave me
You'll always be part of the person I'll become
And I'll never leave you
You give me memories that I know could never leave.
On my knees, all on my own
Can't seem to get there oll alone
So come, hear me brother, I won't lie!
