Late at night
Walking home
Too drunk
Been dancing at a club
Out of town
Beam me up take me down
Did you pick me
'Cause there's nobody around

Up
Another round
Come on and pick me
Because you wanna drag me down
Beam me up
Take me down
I'm a victim
'Cause there's nobody around

Well, we're home
Wanna sit on my couch?
Ouch!
What
What happened after this
He made me do these things
My mind was drifting off, drifting off

If you don't stop,
Hey turn around
Did you pick me
'Cause there's no one else around
Hold up,
Another round
I'm a victim
'Cause you wanna drag me down

Stop,
Turn around
Do I realize theses happening
Right now?
Hold up
Another round
I'm a victim
'Cause there's no one else around

Two days later I couldn't speak
I couldn't sleep
Couldn't find out how to be me
And I want to the doctor who said
Come here tell us everything
A pill atest and a blood pressure
Plastic cup to piss in
And you have to take your clothes off
I had to show my body again

I'm not at home

If you don't stop,
Hey turn around
Did you pick me
'Cause there's no one else around
Hold up,
Another round
I'm a victim
'Cause you wanna drag me down

Stop,
Turn around
Do I realize theses happening
Right now?
Hold up
Another round
I'm a victim
'Cause there's no one else around

If you don't stop,
Hey turn around
Did you pick me
'Cause there's no one else around
Hold up,
Another round
I'm a victim
'Cause you wanna drag me down

Too drunk
Late at night
