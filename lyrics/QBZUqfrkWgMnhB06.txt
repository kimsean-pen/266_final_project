In between moons
I was the sea, I was the sea
In between stars
I was the salt, I was the salt
Wild and vulgar were the ones that you could see
The ugly idols not cherished by me

In between moons
I was the spring, I was the spring
In between stars
I was the iron, I was the iron
Washed and scrubbed from morning till night
The sky is heavy on my shoulders but alright

It happened so very long ago
We don't know when or how
Nobody knows what we're doing here even now

In between moons
I was the sea, I was the sea
In between stars
I was the salt, I was the salt
You put your hope at the bottom of the jar
Sent out a swarm of bees to sting from afar

Or turn the axe around in my hands
Throw me in the fire
Warm yourself, kid yourself a little while

In between moons
I was the spring, I was the spring
In between stars
I was the iron, I was the iron
At first you couldn't
No, you didn't love enough
And afterwards, you loved far too much

I don't know how I've come to see the world
Exclusively through your eyes
Everything I buy and eat and do with you in mind
