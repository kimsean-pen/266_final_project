Off the ground headin for another take
I remember all the sounds you used to make
But I keep my down despite the animals on your face
How many times have I said
I've got a feeling we will never get closer than this
I can't imagine there's a way to get closer than this
Catch up with the other kids
Even falling far behind
Starlight in the middle of the Ocean
Opens up my heart tonight

I've got a feeling we will never get closer than this
I can't imagine there's a way to get closer than this
I've got a feeling we will never get closer than this
I can't imagine there's a way to get closer than this

And I keep on pushin
Keep on pushin
Keep on pushin on
Oh we keep on pushin
Keep on pushin
Keep on pushin on

I've got a feeling we will never get closer than this
I can't imagine there's a way to get closer than this
I've got a feeling we will never get closer than this
I can't imagine there's a way to get closer than this

And we keep on pushin
Keep on pushin
Keep on pushin on
And we keep on pushin
Keep on pushin
Keep on pushin on
