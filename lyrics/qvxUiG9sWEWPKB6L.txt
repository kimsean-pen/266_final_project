Nowhere left to go
I wanna swim to you, baby
But I'm taking the slow way
I brace myself
I feel the warm summer waves
I'm waving goodbye to the places that we had
I rise from the shore
Naked again as I crawl across the sand
I feel helpless and lost in irrational poison
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can you take me as I am? (Take me to somewhere new)
I lost everything I had (Show me the promised land)
I can't speak a word to you (Talking my way into)
It's a poison you can't understand
You ripped up my world
You left me in ribbons, so unsure
And I tried and I tried and I failed
To get to you, to you
I swear these sins weren't mine
But the jury wastes no time
Passing sentence on me
Frightened as hell
I've polluted myself with irrational poison
Watch me collapse
The sins of the past have brought me to my knees
As I look back at the sad aftermath of my last several choices
Straight from the tap, irrational poison (Yeah, yeah)
I can feel the undertow surround me
It's irrational poison to me
And how it takes down everyone around me
It's irrational poison to me
