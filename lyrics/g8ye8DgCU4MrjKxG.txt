Love, I have wounds
Only you can mend
You can mend.
Oh...
I guess that's love
I can't pretend

I can't pretend.
Oh...
Feel, my skin is rough
But it can be cleansed
It can be cleansed.
My arms are tough

But they can be bent
They can be bent.
And I wanna fight
But I can't contend.
I guess that's love

I can't pretend
I can't pretend.
Oh...
Oh feel our bodies grow
And our souls they blend.
Yeah love I hope you know
How much my heart depends.

But I guess that's love I can't pretend
I can't pretend.
Oh...
I guess that's love I can't pretend.
I can't pretend
Oh...
Oh feel our bodies grow
and our souls they blend.
Yeah love I hope you know
how much my heart depends.
I guess that's love I can't pretend
I can't pretend, oh oh oh
I guess that's love I can't pretend
I can't pretend.
Oh...
