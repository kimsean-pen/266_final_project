See, I've got this woman here
She loves me all the time
No need for excuses
No pressures in my mind

And she said love it all, love it all, love it all
And she said love it all, love it all, love it all

My heart was living down
And I've been pushed over the line
But on your hand, it'd be broken
And I'll be all over this time

And she said love it all, love it all, love it all
And she said love it all, love it all, love it all
And she said love it all, love it all, love it all
And she said love it all, love it all, love it all

And she said love it all, love it all, love it all
And she said love it all, love it all, love it all
And she said love it all, love it all, love it all
And she said love it all, love it all, love it all

Love it all, love it all, love it all
And she said love it all, love it all, love it all
