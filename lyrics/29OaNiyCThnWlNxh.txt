Were A your telephone
What would I hear?
And what good are words
If they never reach your ear?

Were A your nuclear bomb
What would I dream?
And would A care at all
Would I squint into the gleam?

Pleased to meet you
The world is at your command
Want real life
Want real life
Want real life

Were A oxygen
How would I breathe?
And if A lost it all on red
Tell me, what would I grieve?

What can A say is real
Numbers or words?
And were A the wind
Is I for the birds?

A is nowhere
I, a puzzle, a game
Want real life
Want real life
Want real life
