Chaos, entropy
Enlighting visions from the stars.
Doom, corruption
Trauma of this feeble globe.

Shifting parallel dimensions,
Minds drift afar...
Sinister whispers
Breath from beyond.

Called throughout worlds
By wisdom so old
Entangled in fear
Of what lurks
Behind the veils.

Chaos, entropy
Enlighting visions from the stars.
Doom, corruption
Trauma of this feeble globe.

Boundless force on black cosmic throne
Blind, bereft of mind.
Blasphemy abominate!

Idiot divinity,
Death and creation incarnate!
Monotonous whining
Of accursed flutes...

Thou shalt not speak his name,
Daemon sultan!
He, who gnaws hungrily
In lightless chambers...
Seething palace
Beyond time and space.
Thou shalt not speak his name,
Daemon sultan!

Calculating the structures
Of space and time.
What rises into being
Shell be unmade.
Spheres shatter...
Myriads of worlds undone...
As his flute falls
To silence eternally...

It is he, who holdeth the Sceptre of Obliteration.
It is he, who wieldeth the Scythe of Cosmic Chaos!
