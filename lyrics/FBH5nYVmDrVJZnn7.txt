Who are you, girl?
Who are you, boy?
Bet I know what you're up to

Can I come along?
Your home number on the wall
I just had to call

Had to
I'm not the only one
Who will run with a knife

Open up your eyes
Open up your room
Open up your arms

One six two,
Seven eight
Two six three,
Seven eight nine

Where's your daddy now?
I heard he ran away
Who are you, girl?

'Cause I'm so bored with myself anyway
Any time and any place
I'll just hang around

Open up your eyes
Open up your room
Open up your arms

One six two,
Seven eight
Two six three,
Seven eight nine

Open up your eyes
Open up your room
Open up your arms
Open up your door

Open up your eyes
Open up your room
Open up your arms.
