There's a difference between
The things that we say and we mean
So take a deep breath
Breathe in through your chest
And you're lying face first on your mothers floor
Saying "oh dear God what'd you do that for?"
Now you're lying face first on your fathers floor
Saying "oh dear God what'd you do that for?"
You're trying to be brave
And you've been brave before
I'll help you clean out your basement
And fall asleep on your floor
And I know you really wanna make it out alive
And I know you really wanna make it out alive
And I know you really wanna make it out
There'll be a clash between you and the you that's staring back
But kid you'll be okay
you get better with age
and kid you'll be okay
you get better with age
remember that you are a snail
in every pinch
your shell may get heavy
but you'll push through every inch
and i know you really wanna make it out alive
and i know you really wanna make it out alive
and i know you really wanna make it out
and i know you're really gonna make it out
