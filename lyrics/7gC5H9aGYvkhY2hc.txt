Free from it all
I'm not gonna change till I want to
And I'm free from it all
I'm not gonna change till I want to

By the way she looked, I should've calmed down
I went too far
Oh, that's all I've got to say
By the way she looked, I should've calmed down
I went too far
Oh, that's all I've got to say

Free from it all
I'm not gonna change till I want to
And I'm free from the world
Where I've built too many walls

By the way she looked, I should've calmed down
I went too far
Oh, that's all I've got to say
By the way she looked, I should've calmed down
I went too far
Oh, I went too far
