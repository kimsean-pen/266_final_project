We gonna burn it up like rockstars
Go nirvana in here
We gonna set it out, tick-tock
Life is a video game
And we could be in love or not lie
See I really don't care
I just wanna be right here
I just wanna be right here, ah
We can rule the oceans
We can rule the world
We'd be the commotion, baby
So we never regret that life's gonna be what we be
So we turn the music up tonight
Let the beat set you free
Give it everything you got
And dance all your worries away
Forget yesterday
This life is a game
And love is the name
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Oh, and love is the name
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
I love the way your skin feels on mine
Yeah, I'm digging your style
The way you let me in on secrets that are already mine
And we could be in love or not now
See, I really don't care
I just wanna be right here
I just wanna be right here, ah
We could rule the oceans
We could rule the world
We'd be the commotion, baby
So we never regret that life's gonna be what we be
So we turn the music up tonight
Let the beat set you free
Give it everything you got
And dance all your worries away
Forget yesterday
This life is a game
And love is the name
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Oh, and love is the name
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
This life is a game
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
And love is the name
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
So we never regret that life's gonna be what we be
Oh, so we turn the music up tonight
Let the beat set you free
Give it everything you got
And dance all your worries away, oh
Forget yesterday
This life is a game
And love is the name
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Oh, and love is the name
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
And life is a game
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
And love is the name
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
And love is the name
