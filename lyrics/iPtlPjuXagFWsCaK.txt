Turncoat, killer, liar, thief
Turncoat, killer, liar, thief
Criminal with protection of the law, go

State lies dressed up as evening news
We're tired of lies we want the truth
Broadcast by corpses courting you
We're tired of lies we want the truth

Most people they will never know
We're tired of lies we want the truth
With you or against you?
Then I am against you because you're a

Turncoat, killer, liar, thief
Criminal with protection of the law
I can't hear you
Turncoat, killer, liar, thief
Criminal with protection of the law

In your corner, makes me wanna, oh
Douse myself in gasoline
Civil servants fall in line for you
Too brainwashed to see the truth
You use anyone you can

Woah, oh, woah, oh, woah, oh

Turncoat, killer, liar, thief
Criminal with protection of the law
Turncoat, killer, liar, thief
Criminal with protection of the law, go

Liar, go
A turncoat and a thief
Criminal with protection of the law, the law
Criminal with protection of the law
Thank you
