Ooh baby
There's somethin' I gotta tell ya
Think that you should know
What's on my mind
Ooh baby
I'm feelin' our situation
It's gettin' stronger
We on it
I gotta take my time

See there's so much about you
That I want to explore
Physical attraction
We just can't ignore it, no
But before we go too far
Across the line
Gotta really make sure
That I'm sure
Umm

Slow down babe
Let's take our time
Slow down babe
(Slow down babe)
If you don't mind
(Baby slow down)
Slow down babe
Before we make this move
Slow down babe
(Before we make this move)
Baby slow down
(I think it's really too soon)

Ooh baby
It's like I known you forever
My medulla oblongata
Is electrified
Ooh baby
Whenever we're alone together
I'm 'bout to explode
And it feels so right
But I gotta take my time

There's so much about you
That I want to explore
Physical attraction, we just
Can't ignore it, no
But before we go too far
Across the line
Gotta really make sure
That I'm sure
Oh

Slow down babe
Let's take our time
(Slow down baby)
Slow down babe
(Slow down baby)
If you don't mind
(Baby slow down)
Slow down babe

Slow down babe
(Before we make this move)
Baby slow down
(Baby it's really too soon)
Soon yeah

See I know what is best
(Oh)
'Cause I been here before
Gave myself to someone
(Oh)
For all the wrong reasons
But this time around
(Oh)
I don't wanna do that again
I just wanna make this the way
(Oh)
That I've dreamed of
So baby you got to

Slow down babe
(I'm feelin')
Let's take our time
(I'm feelin' you too)
Slow down babe
(Before we make this move)
If you don't mind
(No it's really too soon)
Slow down babe
(Slow down babe)
Before we make this move

Slow down babe

Baby slow down

Slow down
You got to slow down

Baby slow down
You got to slow down
You got to slow down
You've got to slow down
