When the wind is blowing in your face
Sometimes in life you don't see straight
Wait for him
He will show

When your head is in a certain place
Nobody around to make you say
Stand strong and you will go

Wait till you see my smile
Wait till they see your smile

Don't they love to see you down
Kick you while you are on the ground
Don't let emotions show

People always make you late
Don't let them get in your way
See they say things they don't know

Wait till you see my smile
Wait till they see your smile

Hey
So you doing better now
Everybody comes around
Cause you don't really need much
You are stronger and your better and you are ready for whatever
Saying
Wait till you see my smile
Wait till they see your smile
Wait till you see my smile
Wait till they see your smile
