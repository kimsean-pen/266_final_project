She says she barely sleeps
And if she does it's fitfully
Hears footsteps in the leaves
And if she dreams she dreams of
The sounds you'll never speak
The words left out between the beat
Of clashing teeth and tongues
The roar of background hum
That blooms inside her listening ears
To be the noise she wants to hear
She only wants to do you proud
Only wants to make you proud now
And in a stranger's bed
Head next to stranger's head
She chokes on words that won't come out
The TV's turned up far too loud, too loud

So here we go again
Head on the block again
The guillotine has just quickened pace
Teeth sink in to leave their taste, of blood
And her head hits the floor
Lips still moving, mouthing to implore
"You're all I want, you're all I want, you're all I want
And all I want to..."

She says she barely sleeps
And if she does it's fitfully
Hears footsteps in the leaves
And if she dreams she dreams of
The sounds you'll never speak
The words you leave between the beat
Of clashing teeth and tongues
The roar of background hum
That blooms inside her listening ears
To be the song she wants to hear
She only wants to do you proud
Only wants to do you proud now
And in a foreign bed
Head next to foreign head
The sad song in a minor key
The sad song in a minor key, please
