All my life, I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to

This will not do
'Cause I was raised up (ah)
To be admired (ah) to be noticed (ah)
But when you're withdrawn (ah)

It's the closest thing (ah)
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do (Ohh)
(Oooh...) Ooh...
Oooh (Oh, oh)...

I'm faking glory
Lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand new

But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back
It's a moon eclipse, oh
And I can tell you that

When the lights come on
I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that

Happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scaled
Without thinking of size

I was frightened of every little thing
That I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me, but
I learned not to want the quiet of a room

With no one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval
The things that make me go, oh
(Oh...) Oh... (Ah...)

It's a switch flipped

It's a moon eclipse, oh

Happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scaled
Without thinking of size

To trip me up and laugh at me, but

With no one around to find me out

Oh, oh (ah)...
