Yeah we love and not another
One blood for all one face of the earth
One time while I be in life
These are the feet in genealogy
God is majesty
Open your ears and open your heart and
listen to these words from the universe message
God is a respecter of no one Is giver of all my lord

The treasures of righteousness is love
