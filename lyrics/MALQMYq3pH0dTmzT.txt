Live your life, have your say
Read your stars, day by day
If I could have anything in the world for free
I wouldn't share it with anyone else but me
Oh, live your life, go your way
And I said oh no

Live your life, stake your claim
Wash your clothes, change your name
Ooh, and I said oh, no, no
If I could have anything in the world for free
I wouldn't share it with anyone else but me

You're too twisted by half...
Oh, it's fair enough

So live your life, build a home
And fill it full of flowers and a bottle of old cologne
Yeah, if I could have anything in the world for free
I wouldn't share it with anyone else but me
Except perhaps a certain someone
Except perhaps a certain someone

Except perhaps a certain someone
Just to be sure I know the way out

You're too twisted by half...
Oh, it's fair enough

Oh, I'd be careful living in a block of flats
And I never take the lift to the top
No, I never take the lift to the top

Ah, you're too twisted by half...
Ah, and it's fair enough

Take a swim round, take a look down
I'll never believe what we've found
We figured it out, we figured it out
We lived in a house, in a cold room
