Always, Always and Forever
Always, Always and Forever

I'm sitting here
I'm thinking back to a time when I was young
My memory is clear as day
I'm listening to the dishes clink
You were downstairs
you would sing
songs of praise
And all the times we laughed with you
And all the times that you stayed true to us
Now we'll say

I said I thank you
I'll always thank you
More than you would know
Than I could ever show
And I love you
I'll always love you
There's nothing I won't do
to say these words to you
That you're beautiful forever

Always, Always and forever

you were my mom, you were my dad
The only thing I ever had was you, it's true
And even when the times got hard you were there
To let us know that we'd get through
you showed me how to be a man
You taught me how to understand
the things people do
You showed me how to love my God
You taught me that not everyone
knows the truth

And I thank you
I'll always thank you
More than you would know
Than I could ever show
And I love you
I'll always love you
There's nothing I won't do
to say these words to you
That you will live forever

Forever and ever
Forever and ever

I said I thank you
I'll always thank you
More than you would know
Than I could ever show
And I love you
I'll always love you
There's nothing I won't do
to say these words to you

That I thank you
Will always thank you
More than you would know
Than I could ever show
And I love you
I'll always love you
There's nothing I won't do
to say these words to you

That you will live forever
