Doesn't make any sense to you
When I do everything you tell me not to do
When you turn the corner you built for me
You can bet it's way too good to be true
So you say, you can see through the cracks of my pain
There's a satellite image like a map of my brain, my brain

Too many voices drown the ones that need to be heard the most
turn it down, turn it down
Turn it down, turn it down
Everyone's gonna get their turn
So there's no need to feel lost
in the crowd, turn me up, turn me up
Turn me up, turn me up.

You best be believing, best be believing
Best be believing, best be believing
Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah
You best be believing, best be believing
Best be believing, best be believing
Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah

...
If that's all you really wanted to be
Better brace yourself for the hurricane we deliver
Best prepare for the winter
We can wake up at bed beat the fury in our heads
We'll be running downstream while you're swimming up river

It'll make you shiver
too many voices drown the ones that need to be heard the most
turn it down, turn it down
Turn it down, turn it down
Everyone's gonna get their turn
So there's no need to feel lost
in the crowd, turn me off, turn me off

Turn me up, turn me up
You best be believing, best be believing
Best be believing, best be believing
Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah
You best be believing, best be believing
Best be believing, best be believing

Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah
You pray I'll stay in the sun
But that's not what I'm made of
That's not what I'm made of
Now you say, I'm not sweet enough to talk
But I still got sugar, I still got sugar
I still got sugar, I still got sugar
You best be believing, best be believing
Best be believing, best be believing
Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Best be, best be believing
