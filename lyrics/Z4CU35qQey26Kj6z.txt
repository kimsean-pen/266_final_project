Yeah, ayy
Menoh!
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Wrists, dancing
Sink your ship, Titanic
My clique full of bandits
Grab for that lettuce sandwich
The coupe, is tinted
She thought it was rented
I want it, I'mma spend it
Live my life with no limits

I'ma do the damage, I'ma do the damage
I'ma do the damage, bitch I'ma do the damage
Know I'ma do the damage
Just know I'm taking credit
I said it then I meant it
Man, 'cause I'm so relentless

You want to hang with a rockstar, live a fast life and get high
We 'gon come through, shut the block down
Make 'em lay low like drive-byes
I don't fuck with them, they don't fuck with me
It gets to their heads but not mines
I'm my own man, I don't need no hands,
Who go switch with me and change sides
Ooh, its lit
Milk the game like a tit
I put my bitch in Rick
Now she 'gon ride this dick
My gang, official
No you don't want this issue
Blast off hard like a missle
Real diamonds these aren't crystals
Lil' shawty, go crazy
Pull up in black Mercedes
Thank god my momma made me
Boy you's a momma's baby
The throne was set for taking
I press reset on patience
The purse makes her amazing
Soak it up like a raisin

Wrists, dancing
Sink your ship, Titanic
My clique full of bandits
Grab for that lettuce sandwich
The coupe, is tinted
She thought it was rented
I want it, I'ma spend it
Live my life with no limits

I'ma do the damage, I'ma do the damage
I'ma do the damage, bitch I'ma do the damage
Know I'ma do the damage
Just know I'm taking credit
I said it then I meant it
Man, 'cause I'm so relentless

Senorita, she a eater
My bitch a queen like Latifah
Roll ten woods of that reefer
Smoke KK Wiz Khalifa
Got music blastin' through my speakers
In the game you was on the bleachers
I don't text her back, I don't need her
You really thought she was a keeper
Woah, not sorry, flexed up with my posse
Tattoos all on my body
Diamonds is playing hockey
Cold, brr
Let me go up her skirt
Louis V on her purse
Sunday she go to church
She fragile, but worth it
I know nobody perfect
Not lying in my verses
Take credit like immersion
Yeah, Immortal, bandit
Bitch I'm not from this planet
I need that lettuce sandwich
Don't think they understand it

Wrists, dancing
Sink your ship, Titanic
My clique full of bandits
Grab for that lettuce sandwich
The coupe, is tinted
She thought it was rented
I want it, I'mma spend it
Live my life with no limits

I'ma do the damage, I'ma do the damage
I'ma do the damage, bitch I'ma do the damage
Know I'ma do the damage
Just know I'm taking credit
I said it then I meant it
Man, 'cause I'm so relentless
