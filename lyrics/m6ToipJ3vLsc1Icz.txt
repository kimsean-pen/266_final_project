Your heart is a fire,
But the cold is comforting
My mouth is a liar,
With my silver tongue in cheek

The silence is deafening
My words cut deep
The darkness is blinding
Consuming me

All I am is what I say
So turn your back and walk away
My words cut deep,
But the silence is deafening

I am starving
(For something that's real)
So I bite the hand that feeds
(They all stole from me)
The pieces I'm missing
(Exactly what I need)
Will be exactly what I need

The silence is deafening
My words cut deep
The darkness is blinding
Consuming me

All I am is what I say
So turn your back and walk away
My words cut deep,
But the silence is deafening

I question every part of who I am
I question every part of who I am
It's hard to tell which side of me is in the right
With these two different people inside of me
Fighting for my life,
Fighting for my life
I question every part of who I am

The silence is deafening
My words cut deep
The darkness is blinding,
Consuming me
All I am is what I say
So turn your back and walk away
My words cut deep,
But the silence is deafening
