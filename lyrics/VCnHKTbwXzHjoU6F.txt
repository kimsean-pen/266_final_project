No never, never will the sun go down on us
No never, never will I lose your tender touch
'Cause always, you will be the twinkle in my eye
And always, I will be your smile

Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always

No never, never will I walk away from this
No never, will leave this place
'Cause always, I just walk around here with our love
And always, only you will be in love

Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always

(Synth Solo)

No never, never will the sun go down on us
No never, never will I lose your tender touch
'Cause always, you will be the twinkle in my eye
And always, I will be your smile

Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always...
