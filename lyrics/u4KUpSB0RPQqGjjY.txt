As little moments fade
They come forth at night
Demanding all I think about
Maybe its time we go

Well I cant get better, I'm stoned
I wont be letting her out
And I cant keep drowning this down

Oh, your eyes they glow
So pretty they've lost their worth,
They keep me below
And I know I'm dead inside
I'm reminded every night
So close, just know it wont be me

One goal is: destroying this moment
Open, and tell me everything that I can't help but see
Contagious lies they never leave

The goal in your and my eyes
The goal you cant even see
Yah the goal I'm waking, waking up

Oh, your eyes they glow
So pretty they've lost their worth,
They keep me below
And I know I'm dead inside
I'm reminded every night
So close, just know it wont be me

Did you know so close?
its never been enough to notice,
enough to notice how I am right
I'm close but not getting up,
Your close but not getting up,
I'm close but not getting up,
Getting off
I'm not getting off

Oh, your eyes they glow
So pretty they've lost their worth,
They keep me below
And I know I'm dead inside
I'm reminded every night
So close, just know it wont be me
