Road Racin'.
Movin' on down the line.
Shiftin' gears, racin' through space and time.
Move so fast I can't explain.
Hands on the wheel I'm on the road again.
Baby only time to my lovin' machine.
Radio's blastin'.
Rockin' all night.
Rolling down the highway through the dead of night.
Road Racin'.

Woooo!

Road Racin'.
Feel the earth move under my wheels.
It's road racin', the chills you get from the turns and squeels.
On my way drivin' up to you.
Don't stop me now, what you gunna do?
Running down the highway with a push in our feet.
World's flashing by, passing the smoke and the heat.
We're road racin'.

Woo! Road Racin.

Awe kick it out now.

Aweee Oh!

(Shreddd!)

(Break)

Road Racin'.
Keep on movin' on down the line.
Shiftin' gears, racin' through space and time.
Move so fast I can't explain.
Hands on the wheel I'm on the road again.
Baby only time to my lovin' machine.
Radio's blastin'.
Rockin' all night.
Rolling down the highway through the dead of night.
Road racin'.

(Shred Strikes Again!)
Woo!

We're road racin', yeah.
Alright.

Road Racin'...
