It gets dark,
and a shiver moves across my skin,
There are stars,
But the cloudy skies won't let them in,
I'm gonna write a few words,
And I hope the carry all this way,
Back to the start of this girl,
When she still had something good to say

Seventeen,
And you know exactly what you need,
Twenty-two,
And they still see something great in you,
But no one tells you a word,
About the lonely echo in your heart,
When it's been filled up with hurt,
And your whole world starts to come apart

The rest in peace, won't ever comeback,
All the stories I was told,
I had a dream, it's fading to black,
Just like me it's growing old,
So rest in peace, there is no comeback,
I will never have or hold,
Now hear me screaming from the pitch-black,
That this world is not a home

Say goodbye,
That's the only word you'll ever need,
When you try,
It gets so much harder to succeed,
If I had nothing to lose,
I would surely lose it in the end
And you know if I could choose,
I would never do it all again

The rest in peace, won't ever comeback,
All the stories I was told,
I had a dream, it's fading to black,
Just like me it's growing old,
So rest in peace, there is no comeback,
I will never have or hold,
Now hear me screaming from the pitch-black,
That this world is not a home

It's pumping through my system,
Get the poison out of me,
What good is a believer,
When there's nothing to believe,
So put me in a shuttle,
Let me spin around the world,
Show me the stars

Ooooooh

The rest in peace, won't ever comeback,
All the stories I was told,
I had a dream, it's fading to black,
Just like me it's growing old,
So rest in peace, there is no comeback,
I will never have or hold,
Now hear me screaming from the pitch-black,
That this world is not a home
