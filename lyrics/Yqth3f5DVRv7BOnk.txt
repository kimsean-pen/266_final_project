Rockin up the lights
You get enough of the city
When your friends are not around
You are coming up with the vibe
And you're always dancing in the dark
And I know you don't like to be alone...

They call your name but you're never there
Cause you don't belong and you never sleep
Boy you're always dancing in the dark
And you wanna show what's inside your mind

They call your name but you're never there
Cause you don't belong and you never sleep
Boy you're always dancing in the dark
And you wanna show what's inside your mind

You don't wanna go you don't wanna go
Oh you don't wanna go you don't wanna go
Always running never stoping
But now you got to watch the world start

You don't wanna go you don't wanna go
Oh you don't wanna go you don't wanna go
Always running never stoping
But now you got to watch the world start

They call your name but you're never there
Cause you don't belong and you never sleep
Boy you're always dancing in the dark
And you wanna show what's inside your mind

They call your name but you're never there
Cause you don't belong and you never sleep
Boy you're always dancing in the dark
And you wanna show what's inside your mind
