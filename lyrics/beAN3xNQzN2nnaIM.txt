Oh, oh, yeah

I know some lovers would be satisfied
With sweet "I love you's" and some pretty lines
But that won't get you in this heart of mine
No you'll never steal my heart away
With just words sweet words that you say
It's all in the things that you do
I'm telling you

If you want me to believe that I'm the only one you need
I need lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof
Baby hold me in your arms and show me something from the heart
Give me lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof
From you, baby

And if the love you got is strong and true
And if you love me like you say you do
Your tender touch will tell the honest truth
And your kiss could never tell a lie
'Coz I'd see it in your eyes
There's one way to ease any doubt
I tell you now

If you want me to believe that I'm the only one you need
I need lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof
Baby I won't be impressed unless I get some tenderness
Give me lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof, yeah
From you, (From you)

(I need lovin' proof), If the love is right
(I need lovin' proof), Prove it to me all night
(I need lovin' proof), From you

'Coz you'll never steal my heart away
With just words, sweet words that you say
It's all in the things that you do
I'm telling you, telling you baby

If you want me to believe that I'm the only one you need
I need lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof
Baby hold me in your arms and show me something from the heart
Give me lovin' proof, give me lovin' proof
From you, (From you)
Give me lovin' proof, baby

If the love is right
If you want me to believe, baby
Ah, love baby
Gimme, gimme, gimme lovin' proof

I need lovin' proof, yeah
If you want me to believe, baby
Give me lovin' proof
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme love...

Love, give me
If you want me to believe, baby
Give me lovin' proof
I need, I need, I need lovin' proof
Baby, you need, love done, baby
