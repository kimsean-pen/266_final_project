You where you were coming up
Did you think everyone knew
Something unclear

And when you thrown in a crowd
Could you believe yourself
Did you repeat yourself
Cause no one will hear
Just say it again
Cause they never got you and you never got them
Uh-huh

Don't let it break
Don't let it start
Don't let 'em in
Don't go too far

Cover your tracks
Cover the path to the heart
Don't let those footholds start
And don't let no one in
Cause they never got you and you never got them
Uh-huh

You when you were breaking up
Oh now they... they was just waking up
Just waking up
And back in that place where you could fall
Did it pay to play along
That's where I'm coming from
I'd rather roll it myself
Just let it be
Cause I never got them and they never got me
No I never got them and they never got me
