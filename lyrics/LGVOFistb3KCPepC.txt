I can take the nine millimeter on the side
Swing it by if you like
we can drive to McDonald's
Hang out with the toddlers
Sneak out the back
or even do a runner
Gonna go slow,
into the K-hole
Lick the whole bowl
like a kid with Cheerios
I don't waste my time,
only here for the field goal
Make my clit rise
like a flag on a flag pole

Cause
you know me, I know you
You know me just like I know you do
No identity necessity
It's what you chose to do
So
give me resurrection
Or do you believe in the natural selection
Don't
need you to do an exception
Let's keep it clean like a gel disinfection

Cause
you know me
I know you
You know me
I know you
You know, you know
You know me
I know you
You know me
I know you
I know, I know

Ten centimeter, open wide
I can see what you mean when I go through the tunnel
Open full frontal
Caught me flash back up, cause I like it double
Gonna go slow, or be a no show
Save the whole world
with a hero syndrome
I'm the new paradigm
put it down on the payroll
Play it, quick time,
like a car you could download

Cause
you know me, I know you
You know me just like I know you do
No identity necessity
It's what you chose to do
So
give me resurrection
Or do you believe in the natural selection
Don't
need you to do an exception
Let's keep it clean like a gel disinfection

Cause you know me
I know you
You know me
I know you
You know, you know
You know me
I know you
You know me
I know you
I know, I know
