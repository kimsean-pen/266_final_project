Just woke up, it's day ten
It still hurts like back then
Tears like rain flood my bed
Can't erase what I did

This is what I get for
Telling you I don't need
You around, what a lie
And this is what I get for
Thinking there was ever
Someone better in my life

And it's all kinds of wrong
Without you
I can't breathe when you're gone
Don't know what to do
Now, the best of me
Is lost in a memory
And it's all kinds of wrong
Without you

If I had one more try
No more games, no more lies
Missing you is a lonely ride
Feel more dead than alive

This is what I get for
Telling you to pack your
Things and just get out
And this is what I get for

Pushing you away, now
No one's gonna bail me out

And it's all kinds of wrong
Without you,
I can't breathe when you're gone
Don't know what to do
Now, the best of me
Is lost in a memory
And it's all kinds of wrong
Without you

Want you back by my side
I want back what was right
I know I should be strong
Time for me to move on
But this all feels so wrong

And it's all kinds of wrong
Without you,
I can't breathe when you're gone
Don't know what to do
Now, the best of me
Is lost in a memory
And it's all kinds of wrong
Without you

Now, the best of me
Is lost in a memory
And it's all kinds of wrong
Without you
