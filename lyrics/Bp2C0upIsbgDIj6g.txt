Things like this can always take a little time
I always thought we'd be together down the line
We start to fight and can't get over, over what was said
'Cause you see black and white and I see red

And I wonder who let in the rain
You know without you I'm not the same, no
Oh when love gets strong people get weak
Sometimes they lose control and wind up in too deep
They fall like rain, who let in the rain?

Make the bed and cover where you used to sleep
I'm smoothing over promises made in these sheets
Envy lovers passing by out on the street, oh
'Cause what they have I couldn't keep

And I wonder who let in the rain
You know without you I'm not the same, no
Oh when love gets strong people get weak
Sometimes they lose control and wind up in too deep
They fall like rain, who let in the rain? Who let in the rain?

And I wonder who let in the rain
You know without you I'm not the same, no
Oh when love gets strong people get weak
Sometimes they lose control and wind up in too deep
They fall like rain, who let in the rain? Who let in the rain?
Who let in this rain? Who let in the rain?

Let in, who let in the rain?
Who let in this rain? Who let in the rain?
Who let in the, who let in the, who let in the
Who let in, who let in, who let in the rain?
Who let in the rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain?
