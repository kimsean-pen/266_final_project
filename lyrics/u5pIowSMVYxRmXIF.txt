UNTIL WE DIE!

Darkness it floods the sky, like the end of days
A small piece of sanity is all that remains
It's on my brain

On the break of madness
I remember all I love
Take away the fear from this
I'm not givin' up
Not givin' up

We are not alone
We are searching for the truth And we'll always fight this battle till we die

We are not alone
We are searching for the truth and we'll always fight this battle till we die

Just like an animal
Locked inside a cage
I'm pushing back and forth
Waiting with pace
Till I can escape

We are the undead
Raising from the grave
I will fight until nothing remains
Nothing remains

We are not alone
We are searching for the truth And we'll always fight this battle till we die

We are not alone
We are searching for the truth
And we'll always fight this battle till we
Battle till we die

Don't tell me I won't succeed
It lights the fire under me

Don't tell me I won't succeed
It lights the fire
The fire under me

We are not alone
We are searching for the truth
And we'll always fight this battle till we die

We are not alone
We are searching for the truth And we'll always fight this battle till we
Battle till we die!

BATTLE TILL WE DIE!
