Call your girlfriend
It's time you had the talk
Give your reasons
Say it's not her fault
But you just met somebody new
Tell her not to get upset
Second guessing everything
You've said and done

And when she get upset
Tell her that you never meant
To hurt no one
You just tell her that the only
Way her heart will mend
Is when she learns to love again
But it won't make sense right now
But you're still her friend
And then you let her down easy

Call your girlfriend
It's time you had the talk
Give your reasons
Say it's not her fault
But you just met somebody new
Don't you tell her that I give you
Something that you never
Even knew you missed

Don't you even try to explain
How it's so different when we kiss
Yeah, you just tell her that the
Only way her heart will mend
Is when she learns to love again
But it won't make sense right now
But you're still her friend
And then you let her down easy

Call your girlfriend
It's time you had the talk
Give your reasons
Say it's not her fault
But you just met somebody new
And now it's gonna be me and you
