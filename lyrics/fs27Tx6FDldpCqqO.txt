Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oooooooooh
Give it a rest, my love
Let's take this slow
We both need some room to breathe
And if you know what's best for you and me you should leave, baby
So weak when you're around me
So weak when you're around me, yeah, oh
Just because we're two little people in this big ol' world
I could make a livin', baby, you could be my girl
I won't sell drugs no more, I'll move you out the city
Taking you with me, I'm taking you with me
'Cause if I don't got you then I got nobody at all
A cigarette between her lips
She knows just how to work a man like me
And she knows she gets exactly what she needs, I'm so weak baby
So weak when you're around me
So weak when you're around me
Your parents say we're two little people in this big ol' world
But I could make a living, baby, you could be my girl
I won't sell that coke no more, I'll move you out the city
I'm taking you with me, I'm taking you with me
'Cause if I don't got you then I got nobody, I got nobody, I got nobody at all
Yeah
So weak, so weak, oh, yeah
