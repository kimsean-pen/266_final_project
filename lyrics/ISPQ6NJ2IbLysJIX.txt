Go! A storm is coming
The cold is mind numbing
Darkness is descending
Die, there's no escaping
We're all anticipating
Smashing your brains tonight

Firing the cannons and raising the flag
This is the piratical way
We under the sign of the Storm of Ale
Soon with your lives you will pay

Go! We're losing our minds
Into the barrel, and drink what we find

Rum, beer, quests and mead
These are the things that a pirate needs
Raise the flag and let's set sail
Under the sign of the Storm of Ale

Rum, the finest potion
It gives me quite the notion
To vomit over your face
Beer, so cold as ice
Its taste it will suffice
Drinking through night and through day

Quest! This is the meaning of life
A voyage into the unknown
A tankard of mead, is all that I need
To enter the partying zone

Go! We're out of control
Escape from your brain to the depths of your soul

Rum, beer, quests and mead
These are the things that a pirate needs
Raise the flag and let's set sail
Under the sign of the Storm of Ale

Go! We're losing our minds
Into the barrel, and drink what we find
Go! There's no turning back
Ready for battle, it's time to attack

Rum, beer, quests and mead
These are the things that a pirate needs
Raise the flag and let's set sail
Under the sign of the Storm of Ale
