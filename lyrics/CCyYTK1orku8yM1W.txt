She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do

Don't go around breaking young girls hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover

She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For 40 days and for 40 nights

I was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round

So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo a baby crying eyes were like mine (oh, no!)

So we danced on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls hearts
But she came and stood right by me

Smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover

She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
A beauty queen
From a movie screen
She caused a scene
Her eyes that dream
Of being the one
She said I am the one, (the kid's not my son)
She said I am the one, ooh woah
