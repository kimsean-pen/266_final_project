Woke up Sunday morning feeling out of tune
Wrapped my eyes around you, love came in the room
Baby, gonna let my feelings show
Everyday, gonna learn to love you more

Laughing into midnight, lover being my guide
We approach the morning feeling good inside
Baby, gonna let my feelings show
Everyday, gonna learn to love you more

Paying dues and changes, living day to day
Love is necessary to help you find the way
Baby, gonna let my feelings show
Everyday

Try not to hide
What you feel deep inside
If you care, you must dare
To be free as the air

Fairy tales and stories that we fail to see
We will tell the story of reality
Baby, gonna let my feelings show
Everyday, gonna learn to love you more

Tingle in our heartbeat, rapture on the cloud
When softer words are spoken, action speaks out loud
Baby, gonna let my feelings show
Everyday

Try not to hide
What you feel deep inside
If you care, you must dare
To be free as the air

Hey hey hey, yea yea yea
Hey hey hey hey, yea yea yea yea
Hey hey hey, yea yea yea
Hey hey hey hey, yea yea yea

Everyday you gotta let your feelings show

Everyday you gotta let your feelings show

Everyday you gotta let your feelings show
Let your feelings show
Everyday you gotta let your feelings show
