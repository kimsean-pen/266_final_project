The Monolith of Phobos, it stares Buzz in the eye
It bids him question why we live and do or die
The Monolith of Phobos, it stares Buzz in the eye
On a tater-shaped moon that's falling from the sky

The Monolith of Phobos, it makes Buzz ponder how
Like the brownest of the cows, what will we all do now
The Monolith of Phobos, it makes Buzz ponder how
And in his troubled worry, sweat beads upon his brow

The Monolith of Phobos, enters into Buzz's dreams
Riddles bursting from the seams raise passion in the eye that gleams
The Monolith of Phobos, enters into Buzz's dreams
And questions more than answers rise like cream
