I have nothing to say, except I hope you burn in hell.
I never wanna hear your name, or see your face again
You disgust me,
And I'm sure your better off without me.
I let my guard down, but then I met...

Melody, and she needs someone to just be, just be there for her.

It's been a year and now you're
here, and everything is back to normal.
We're in my room and it's your move,
I'm finding home in all of your words.

But the next day when you leave and go back to London,
Its like nothing ever fucking happened.
You left me in the gutter. Then I met...

Melody, and she needs someone to just be, just be there for her.
The first time that we met,
Hello, goodbye was all she said,
And I could tell by her smile and the look that she
Gave me that she wanted to stay and that she wanted to date me.

Melody, I needed you just be, just be there for me.

The first time that we met,
Hello, goodbye was all she said,
And I could tell by her smile and the look that she
Gave me that she wanted to stay and that she wanted to date me.

Make up your mind, stop fucking with mine.
