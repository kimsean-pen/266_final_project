Saturday night, living the dream
Ordering drinks with your brother's ID
Pretending we like someone's girlfriends band
Put on our boots, carry our heels
Stumbling home over the field
Gin from a bottle stolen from her dad

You smoke to choke the feeling
'Til the walls don't need a ceiling
All we talk about is leaving

All that I know is
No matter how far away
This is the place we were made
I know every streetlight
And maybe the colors will fade
This is the place we were made
By the late nights and fires on the beach
Made by the small town secrets we'd keep
All that I know is
No matter how far away
This is the place we were made

Painting our face, straighten my hair
Wait for the bus, take us somewhere
Anywhere, as far away from home
We're playing poker down in a shed
Talking about boys, now we call ex
Freezing cold and we don't even know

You smoke to choke the feeling
'Til the walls don't need a ceiling
All we talk about is leaving

All that I know is
No matter how far away
This is the place we were made
I know every streetlight
And maybe the colors will fade
This is the place we were made
By the late nights and fires on the beach
Made by the small town secrets we'd keep
All that I know is
No matter how far away
This is the place we were made

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

All that I know is
No matter how far away
This is the place we were made
I know every streetlight
Maybe the colors will fade
This is the place we were made
By the late nights and fires on the beach
Made by the small town secrets we'd keep
All that I know is
No matter how far away
This is the place we were made
