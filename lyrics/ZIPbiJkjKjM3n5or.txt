Can you find a way
To love yourself
A way to let yourself go
Maybe if you tried it
You would even like it
Maybe if you try yourself

Can you find a way
To hug yourself
A way to let yourself off
The book that's in your mouth
Is going to keep you down
And drown you until you die

Can you find a way
To let yourself go
Just look up just let go
Can you find a way
That maybe looks away from
All the things you've ever known

Can you find a way
To be yourself
A way to put yourself down
Hanging up so high
High in the sky
Away from all the people that lie

Why don't you just be here now
Why don't you just be here now
Why are you so proud

Can you find a way
To live your life
That doesn't break you up inside
Maybe if you tried it
You would even like it
Maybe you can let yourself go

Maybe if you tried it
You would even like it
Maybe you can let yourself go
