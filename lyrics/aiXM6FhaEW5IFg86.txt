He was a friend of mine
He was a friend of mine
His killing had no purpose, no reason or rhyme
He was a friend of mine

He was in Dallas town
He was in Dallas town
Form a sixth floor window a gunner shot him down
He died in Dallas town

He never knew my name
He never knew my name
Though I never met him, I knew him just the same
Oh, he was a friend of mine

Leader of a nation for such a precious time
He was a friend of mine
