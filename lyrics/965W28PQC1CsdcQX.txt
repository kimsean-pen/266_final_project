Well, you lost a foe
And you found a friend
Lie down here and be my girl
I'm back now, baby, that man
He won't be coming round here again
Lie down here and be my girl

I'm trying to tread careful, baby
You're as brittle as a wishbone of a bird
Lie down here and be my girl
We've been scribbled in the margins
Of a story that is patently absurd
Lie down here and be my girl

Let it all come down
Yeah, tonight
Shine
Let it all come down

It's a matter of some urgency
O darling can't you see, I can't hold back the tide
Lie down here and be my girl
And stop your frantic little fingers trying to collect
The years that pour from the hole in my side
Lie down here and be my girl

Don't worry, baby, this old snake
Banging at your door
Lie down here and be my girl (has got a few skins left to shed)
You look so good
You look so good
Lie down here and be my girl (and the rest is better left unsaid)

Let it all come down
Yeah, tonight
Shine
Let it all come down

One day I'll buy a factory
I'll assemble you on a production line
Lie down here and be my girl
I'll build a million of you, baby
And every single one of them will be mine
Lie down here and be my girl

I will fill the house with you
Stack you up in every room
Lie down here and be my girl (we'll have a real good time)
But right now I'm sitting here
On my own, going out of my mind
Lie down here and be my girl

Let it all come down
Yeah, tonight
Shine
Tonight

You look so good (tonight)
