The wood burns dark and cloaks the rain
See what we have wrought again
Shadows scrape across the bones
Speak only of stones and home
We seek the sun in endless night
And burn in its forbidden light

From the crown it came down
The beasts gather and turn to form
Another witch in our path
Bringing the crystal view

Come on, down to the sea
Where our fathers see all
See them all unto the road
Laead os then on the site
Of war outside the mind
To the world and to our own
I lower down to become this land

I'll bring a pale shroud
Let's drag it in the blood
We'll make them see him
And take him away forever

Waters wash what we have burned
The winter's ash, the sky has turned
Mounds of earth we build on high
In barrows our remains shall lie
Trouble sleeps where dead men stare
Across the void, we have fallen prey to all

Now I shield the fragile ones
I have offered my own skin
Time must now see this through
I'll do what must be done

The fear in our eyes is clean
Spiders have burrowed deep
And the eggs are all dying
Leaving us within our own fetus

I will awake
Crawl down to you
Reach out my hands
It all falls away
