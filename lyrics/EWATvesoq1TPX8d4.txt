I don't want to be your girl
I want to be your gun
Blow the jaw right off
That handsome face
A .44 magnum

I've been cruising
'Round these parts
Been looking for some fun
I was born way back in '58
Don't belong to anyone

Lean in close and whisper to you
"Let's go for a ride, big guy, let's cruise"
Look you in the eye and know
What I'm gonna do

Baby, I am beautiful and bad
And I'll destroy everything you have

I don't want to be your girl
I want to be your bike
Riding down the highway's
Endless spine
Hot wired with a knife

I don't give a fuck about love
Never did, never will
Wanna take you out
On a date with death
Kiss you with a power drill

'Cuz beauty don't mean shit to me
Only when it's a weapon and deadly
Think you're big and bad
You got nothing on me

And the next time you hit, I hit back
Do you hear me, motherfucker?
Can you dig that?

Baby, I am beautiful and bad
And I destroy everything
Baby, I am beautiful and bad
And I destroy everything you have

Baby, baby
