Tell me what you're thinking of
Oh I guess I know the answer
Each time I walk you start to run
Been prayin' to things I'm dreaming of
They kind of lost their meaning
Still no one else can beat this song

Surely as the even goes
My love for you has grown
So softly...
So softly...
The blooded stitches on your soul
I watch them with a paper scroll
So softly...
So softly...

Tell me what you're thinking of
Oh I guess I'm too demanding
Each time I walk you start to run
Been prayin to things I'm dreaming of
They kind of lost their meaning
Still no one else can beat this song

Surely as the even goes
My love for you has grown
So softly...
So softly...
The blooded stitches on your soul
I wash them off, we'll watch them fall
So softly...
So softly...

So softly...
So softly...

So softly...
So softly...
