Don't wanna hear the news
What's going on
What's coming through
I don't wanna know
don't wanna know
Just wanna hide away
make my my escape
I want the world
to leave me alone
Feels like I feel too much
I've seen too much
For a little while
I want to forget

I wanna be numb
I don't wanna feel this pain no more
Wanna lose touch
I just wanna go and lock the door
I don't wanna think
I don't wanna feel nothing
I wanna be numb
I just wanna be

wanna be numb

Can't find no space to breathe
World's closing in
right on me now
Well that's how it feels
that's how it feels
Too much light
There's too much sound
Wanna turn it off
Wanna shut it out
I need some relief
Think that I think too much
I've seen too much

There is just too much
thought in my head

I wanna be numb
I don't wanna feel this pain no more
Wanna lose touch
I just wanna go and lock the door
I don't wanna think
I don't wanna feel nothing
I wanna be numb
I just wanna be
wanna be
taken away from all the madness
Need to escape
escape from the pain
I'm out on the edge
about to lose my mind

For a little while
For a little while
I wanna be numb

I don't wanna think
I don't wanna feel nothing
I wanna be numb
I don't wanna feel this pain no more
Wanna lose touch
I just wanna go and lock the door
I don't wanna think
I don't wanna feel nothing
I wanna be numb

I just wanna be
wanna be numb
I just wanna be
wanna be numb
All the madness
I wanna be numb
