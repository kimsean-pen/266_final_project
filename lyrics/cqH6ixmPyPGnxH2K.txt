your face is down
alone on your desk
at the end of the city
you were squashed into
there is no one you love

the quivering heart of Gigantor
the quivering heart of Cory

your hair has gone white
the truck you drive could easily crash into
another and bigger truck
it will be so long before i know

your harmonium plays a chord
i can hear it and i can feel it
across all time and across all pain
