(c. currie/k. fowley/steven t.)

Out here in the smokey places
Looking into those empty faces
Short wave says we made the dial
I'm wired for ten million miles

Making midnight music
Singing rock and roll songs
Living midnight music
Just to get along

Back here in this cold hotel
I'm bored but you can tell
Your smile said we did ok
I'm glad we had a chance to play

Making midnight music
Singing rock and roll songs
Living midnight music
Just to get along

From the plane I see the back roads
Your twilight cities your super towns
From the stage I see the drifters
Lost souls who ain't been found

Out there in the five buck seats
We live inside your own heartbeats
We share the falls you take
Everything feels like it's just bout to break

Making midnight music
Singing rock and roll songs
Living midnight music
Just to get along
