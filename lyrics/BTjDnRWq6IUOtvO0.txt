Ive seen the Golden Gate at San Francisco Bay
Ive seen the Empire State and walked down old Broadway
Ive seen those Northern Lights in some Alaskan town
Since I saw you with her I move, I Move Around.

Ive seen a movie star at Hollywood and Vine
Ive seen the Zanzibar and heard the Big Ben chime
Ive seen the Eiffel and Ive been in new Cape Town
Since I saw you with her I move, yeah, I Move Around.

(Bridge)

Ive seen a matador in Barcelona cry
Ive seen old Singapore, the bridge on River Kwai
Ive seen the Mardi Gras and been in one-horse towns
Since I saw you with her I move, Baby I Move Around

I keep movin around
I keep on movin around
