Why is it every move I make turn out to be a bad one
Where's my guardian angel
need one, wish I had one
(I'm right here shorty and I'ma hold you down
and tryin' to - all these - I'ma show you how)
But who?
(My name D like you but my friends call me Damien
and I'ma put you into somethin' about this game we in
You and me could take it there
and you'll be the hottest - ever livin')

That's a givin'
(You'll see)
Hmmm thats what I've been wantin' all my life
Thinkin' 'bout my little man so I call my wife
Well your dada is about to make it happen.

I'm about to make it - rappin'
Today I met this cat
He said his name was Damien
He thinks that we're alot alike and wants to be my friend.

HaHa yeah just like Chuckie

The Snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gon' see them if you livin in the fog
The Snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gon' see them if you livin in the fog
The Snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gon' see them if you livin in the fog
The Snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gon' see them if you livin in the fog

(Hey yo D)

(You a smooth -, I seen you
but nobody knew who pulled the trigger)
Yeah, you know it's always over doe
(You sure, I could've sworn it was over a hoe)
Na, na that ain't my style
(May you stay frontin' but you still my man
and I ain't goin' say nothin', got yo weed go 'head smoke it,
go 'head drink it, go 'head 'n - shorty
you know I can keep a secret
I'm about to have you drivin'
probably a Benz, but we gotta stay friends
Blood out, blood in).

Sounds good to me, fuck it, what I got to lose
Hmm nothin' I can think of, any - would choose
Got me pushin' the whips, takin' trips across seas
Pockets stay laced, - I floss G's
For that - I would bleed, give him my right hand
Now that I think about it yo, that's my man.

The Snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gon' see them if you livin in the fog
The Snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gon' see them if you livin in the fog
The Snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gon' see them if you livin in the fog
The Snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gon' see them if you livin in the fog.

(You like how everything is goin'
You like what I did
You know if you was goin' down
I'd be the one to save it
But yo I need a favor, these cat's across town hate me
Plus they behavior, hasn't been to good lately)
What!?! anything for you dog
Where them - at
(38th and Broadway)
Let me get the Gat
Run up on 'em strapped
Bust off caps on four -
Laid low for 'bout a month and killed two more -
Now I'm ready to chill but you still want me to kill
(Look at what I did for you dog, come on, keep it real)
Aight, - it, I'ma do it, who is it this time
(Hey yo remember that kid Sean you used to be with in 89)
Naw, that's my man
(I thought I was your man)
But yo, that's my -
(Hey who's your biggest fan, either do it or give me your right hand
That's what you said)
I see now, ain't nothin' but trouble ahead.
