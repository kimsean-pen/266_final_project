What in the world can cause you to question that?
How did I come home?
We need you to help
Can I help you alone?
Sun on the roof
Curtains too soon
The day is coming closer
The dreams they've been dreaming
fade inching slowly from the songbird

And I'm not here alone
Whatever you want
Wherever you are
(Wherever you are)
Wherever you are
Wherever you are

Oh, let me tell you
That not every moment matters
Cross walking just leave now
Look you're growing faster and faster
Hope that I'll help you all
Times may not could be at home

And I'm not here alone
So whatever you want
Whatever you want
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are

Home

Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are

Times may not could've been enough
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
