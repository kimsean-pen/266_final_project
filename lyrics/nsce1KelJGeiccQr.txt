Following the shadows of the skies
Or are they only figments of my eyes?
And I'm feeling close to when the race is run
Waiting in our boats to set sail
Sea of joy

Once the door swings open into space
And I'm already waiting in disguise
Is it just a thorn between my eyes?
Waiting in our boats to set sail
Sea of joy

Having trouble coming through
Through this concrete blocks my view
And it's all because of you

Oh, is it just a thorn between my eyes?
Waiting in our boats to set sail
Sea of joy

Sea of joy
Sea of joy
Sailing free
Sea of joy
