One night with you
Makes me feel high
One night with you
So satisfied So satisfied
The higher you fly
The harder you fall
The blue hour comes
Not satisfied not satisfied
Spirits outside I forget myself
Can you give me something can you give me some help?
I tried everything I tried it all
Does it make it better with your dust in my heart
A friend of mine said to protect myself
Can you give me something can you give me some help?
Spirits outside I forget myself
Can you give me something that can turn me around?
We shot the moon
Whose shooting who
The blue hour comes
Not satisfied not satisfied
The blue hour stays
Tell me the truth tell me the truth
Spirits outside I forget myself
Can you give me something can you give me some help?
I tried everything I tried the world
Does it make it better with your dust in my heart?
A friend of mine said to protect myself
Can you give me something can you give me some help?
Spirits outside I forget myself
Can you give me something that can turn me around?
One night
