You remind me
Of places, I have never been.
You take me to places
I wish that I had seen with my own eyes.
But you know that I'm happy here
Staring into yours.
Light another cigarette now honey
Mix another snake bite and black.

We've only a short while here
To be, ourselves
We're only a short while here
So just be yourself now Kirrilee.

I caught my mouth upon
The stud, on your lower lip.
I tossed you the paperclip to unlock the door
Unlock the door but you
Stepped right inside of me.
We're only a short time here so just be
Yourself now Kirrilee.

We've only a short while here
To be ourselves.
We've only a short while here
To be ourselves.
We've only a short while here
To be ourselves.
We're only a short while here so just be
Yourself now Kirrilee.
