I'm a little unlike
You before things had changed
In a compass, I ride
All this feels rearranged

Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone
Shifting to the after
An imposter, I'm not the one you know

I look the same outside
Nearly me even though
I carry something I hide
Underneath the one you know

Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone
Shifting to the after
An imposter, so disowned

Are you surprised black water flows
From wells run dry
I'm not the one you know

Lay me out with our guilt
Watch the explosions fall, rain
Cannot live within this tilt
Carryin' over
I'm not the one you know
Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone
Shifting to the after
An imposter, so disowned

Are you surprised black water flows
From wells run dry
I'm not the one you know
I'm not the one you know
