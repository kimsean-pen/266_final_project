I gave passes to boarder
Gave my bags straight to the porter
Used my Zippo as a guiding light
I see smoke upon the water
Said the sailor to the daughter
"Well, I think I need a rubbing tonight"

And with everybody watching
From the top of the sky
A neon bolt of lightning hit me
Where I found my stride

I found a whole new way to love you
I've got a big surprise
I can't see your eyes
But I think you'll like it too

I found a whole new way to love you
My sneak up from behind
Is gonna blow your mind
But if not this time, we're through

It gets lonesome in the darkness
Even when I dance with partners
With the DJ playing Leather and Lace
I take anything you give me
'Cause I know that God forgives me
It's no accident, expanse of taste

So when everyone got home
I got your tail between my legs
We can talk about relationships
But there's better things to fill your head with

I found a whole new way to love you
I've got a big surprise
I can't see your eyes
But I think you'll like it too

I found a whole new way to love you
My sneak up from behind
Is gonna blow your mind
But if not this time, we're through

Love and leave it, you take it when you need it
You gotta give and take, ignores the breaks
And baby, they're knocking down ways
You gotta gimme some, get some

I found a whole new way to love you
I found a whole new way to love you

I found a whole new way to love you
I've got a big surprise
I can't see your eyes
But I think you'll like it too

I found a whole new way to love you
My sneak up from behind
Is gonna blow your mind
But if not this time, we're through
