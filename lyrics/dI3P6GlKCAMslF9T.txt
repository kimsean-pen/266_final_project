What I would do to get into your head
Crawl out my body into yours instead
Swim through your veins all day and every fiber
Raid your brain and all your desires

Over and over and over and over again

If you only knew
I would do anything
For a taste of you
I would do anything
Just to see inside
And no one else will do
All that I want is to be you

What I would do to get under your skin
Behind your secrets and all of your sins
Play all your games my way, I'll be the master
Parade your frame for all the cameras

Over and over and over and over again

If you only knew
I would do anything
For a taste of you
I would do anything
Just to see inside
And no one else will do
All that I want is to be you

I hear the sound of your name
Circle a loop in my brain
I won't eat, won't sleep 'til I get my way

Just a taste of you
Just a taste of you
(I would do anything)
Just a taste of you
(I would do anything)
Just a taste of you
