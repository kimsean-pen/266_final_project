Familiar music, familiar sound
Does mute your thoughts for the underground
Lonely sight for any turning light
Future prophesy for the [Incomprehensible]

There'll be equal stay and equal play
The underground where none can betray

The underground
The underground
The underground

There'll be no light, so there can be no sight
And you'll judge your fellow men on the stand
By what is right
They'll all turn black so who's to know
As a matter of fact: color, creed and breed must go

The underground
The underground

Familiar music, familiar sound
Does mute your thoughts for the underground
Lonely sight for any turning light
Future prophecy for the [Incomprehensible]

The underground
The underground
The underground
