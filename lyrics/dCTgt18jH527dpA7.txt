It's horrid to see you again
Now, that you're back from the dead
It's horrid to see you again
So bored of being you

It's horrid to see you again
Now, that you're back from the dead
It's horrid to see you again
So bored of being alive, alive, alive

It's horrid to see you again
Acting like you're on some kind of cross
It's horrid to see you again
An emotional retard

It's horrid to see you again
Unaware that I may not be lost
It's horrid to see you again
So bored of being alive, alive
Alive, alive, alive, alive, alive

It's horrid to see you again
Walking around with that egg on your face
It's horrid to see you again
So full of apathy

It's hard to see you again
Caught in a trap that you cannot escape
It's hard to see you again
So bored of being alive, alive
Alive, alive, alive, alive, alive
