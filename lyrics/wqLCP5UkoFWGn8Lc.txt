Follow your bliss, it reads on my chest.
I know I got it tattooed for a reason.
Why can't I just hold it true?
'Cause I'm still crashing all the funerals
Of these people that I never knew.
Yeah!

I'm stuck in a coma, stuck in a never-ending sleep.
And some day I will wake up and realize I made up everything.

I shut the door and turn all the lights out.
And listen to all the songs that the night shouts.
They go something just like this...
So go fill up a glass with tonic rocks and gin
and drink yourself to happiness.

I'm stuck in a coma, stuck in a never-ending sleep.
And some day I will wake up and realize I made up everything.

We can all hang ourselves from gold chandeliers.
And drink goodbye to all, all the pain and fears.
Loose lips have sunk this ship, to a shallow grave.
Washed up upon the rocks. I won't be saved. I won't be saved.

I'm stuck in a coma, stuck in a never-ending sleep.
And some day I will wake up and realize I gave up everything.

(I won't...) So follow your bliss, it reads on my chest. (...be saved.)
(I won't...) I know I got it tattooed for a reason. (...be saved.)
(I won't...) I shut the door and, turn all the lights out. (...be saved.)
(I won't...) And listen to all the songs that the night shouts. (...be saved.)
