I used to be the one that you always ran too
No one could hold you down the way that you knew I would
Now you lay with me pretending that you're even near me
I choose my words with caution cause I know that you don't hear me

I should've known when I saw the signs, but I only looked away
Maybe I held on a little too tight, maybe I held on a little too tight

I don't know who you run to but I won't get in your way
Somehow I guess I loved you too much too soon, too little too late

Don't twist the knife so slowly, just make it painless
Don't talk like you don't know me
and don't act like you're so shameless
Enjoy it while it lasts cause when you least expect it
This might all come back around just to haunt you if you let it

I should've known when I saw the signs, but I only looked away
Maybe I held on a little too tight, maybe I held on a little too tight

I don't know who you run to but I won't get in your way
Somehow I guess I loved you too much too soon, too little too late
