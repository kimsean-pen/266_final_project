When the sun comes up everything's so clear,
I can feel the love in the atmosphere.

Positivity - always comes for free.
I can see your smile shining back at me.

Everything will be ok,
like a light you guide the way
only living for today.

We got the love inside of us
and we just gotta let it show
you got a heart that I can trust
and I will never let it go.
I was running round in circles
'til it came and hit me right between the eyes, oh - you got me hypnotised.

We got the love inside of us
and we just gotta let it show
you got a heart that I can trust
and I will never let it go.
I was running round in circles
'til it came and hit me right between the eyes, oh - your love got me hypnotised.

Never worry 'bout what I did before
with you by my side I don't stress no more.

Everything I know is all thanks to you.
Wanna tell the world, they should hear it too.

Everything will be ok,
like a light you guide the way
Only living for today.

We got the love inside of us
and we just gotta let it show
you got a heart that I can trust
and I will never let it go.
I was running round in circles
'til it came and hit me right between the eyes, oh - you got me hypnotised.

Hey

Hypnotised

So come baby...
Don't stop baby, stop now...
Let's go baby
Don't stop baby, stop now...

Spread the love and spread the joy.
To every girl and every boy.

We'll spread the love and spread the joy
to everyone...

We got the love inside of us
And we just gotta let it show
You got a heart that I can trust
And I will never let it go.

I was running round in circles
'til it came and hit me right between the eyes, oh - you got me hypnotised.
