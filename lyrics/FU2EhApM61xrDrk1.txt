It all seems so strange
The mutes the bums
The dogs with mange, the poor,
Doesn't anybody help themselves anymore
I guess not
Barefoot pregnant women
Little kids whith snot on their face
A land of plenty, a dynasty of disgrace!
I'll manifest for you

Careening on the outer limits of reality
My mission to create a better galaxy
I must not fail them now,
I look inside to see that it's clear
Living life is just not enough
You must persevere
Please grab hold
Not to thing that are bought
But to things that cannot be sold,
Then you'll see
You're released by trial and error
The world's prophecy is to learn
A candle lit from the bottom
Will soon start to burn

Don't dignify, a false spy in the sky
Re-route your path
With the blink of an eye

Walking around with a mind of your own
With a glance to the past
You can see we have grown
How much we have grown

It's been my dream
To re-enter the stream
To let the carnates know
What life really means
If one understands
That's all I can ask
Life to you
Is such a wretched task!
