I ain't gonna push
Ain't gonna push no more

I ain't gonna chase you down
'Cause every time I do, you get further away
I'm just gonna do my thing
Sit back and let all the cards fall where they may

There is no formula
to make you wanna come around
(When you gonna come around)
Everyone thinks they know
but no one's ever showed me how

I ain't gonna push
Ain't gonna push no more
(Then you'll) pull me back
(Then you'll) pull me back
Back into you

Ain't gonna push
Ain't gonna push no more
(Then you'll) pull me back
(Then you'll) pull me back
Back into you

I ain't getting on my knees
'Cause every time I do, you kick dirt in my face
I'm just gonna be myself (myself)
Relax and watch the pieces fall into place

Maybe it's time for me
to do what just feels right
(do what just feels right)
That's when you'll come to me
But I'm not even trying

I ain't gonna push
Ain't gonna push no more
(Then you'll) pull me back
(Then you'll) pull me back
Back into you

Ain't gonna push
Ain't gonna push no more
(Then you'll) pull me back
(Then you'll) pull me back
Back into you

Time for me to stop
analyzing what went wrong
Instead of celebrating what's right

I ain't gonna chase you down
Every time I do you get further away

I ain't gonna push
Ain't gonna push no more
(Then you'll) pull me back
(Then you'll) pull me back
Back into you

Ain't gonna push
Ain't gonna push no more
(Then you'll) pull me back
(Then you'll) pull me back
Back into you

Push, push no more
Push, push no more
