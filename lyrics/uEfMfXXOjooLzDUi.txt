Memories fade into the silence
Haunting me tonight
With hopes last breath
I take this moment in
It will be the last
When morning breaks and sunlight takes the pain away

Ever after never came, and I'm still waiting
For a life that never was
And all the dreams that I laid to rest
Are ghosts that keep me
After all that I've become
I am only one
I am only one

I close my eyes
And bleed this empty heart
Of all that longs to die
When faces lie and love will falter
I'm left with only time
And time will break the dreams that take the pain away

Ever after never came, and I'm still waiting
For a love I'll never have
And all the dreams that I laid to rest
Are ghosts that keep me
After all that I've become
I am only one
I am only one

I'm on my own here and
No one's left to be the hero
This fairy tale got wrong
As night will fall
My heart will die alone

Ever after never came, and I'm still waiting
For my heart to beat again
And all the dreams I've laid to rest
Are ghosts that keep me
After all that I've become
I am only one
I am only one
I am only one
