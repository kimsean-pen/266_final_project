If I should lose your love, boy, shame on me
I was just too stubborn, too blind to see
That I would lose your love, boy
Just tell me how to get you back
'Cause I could never lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love

I remember the moment I first looked in your eyes
And seen nothing looking back at me, it was then I realized
That even though you were there, your heart was long gone
And I knew right then how lost I'd be before you move on

If I should lose your love, boy, shame on me
I was just too stubborn, too blind to see
That I would lose your love, boy
Just tell me how to get you back
'Cause I could never lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love

Before it's final, before you close the door
I am asking you, please, can we try this once more?
Just hold me tight, don't ever let go
And if never comes around I want you to know

I want you, I need you
Can't lose you tonight, no, no
I won't do nothing to lose you
I won't lose this fight
I'm gonna make it right, right

If I should lose your love, boy, shame on me
I was just too stubborn, too blind to see
That I would lose your love, boy
Just tell me how to get you back
'Cause I could never lose your love

Lose your love, shame on me
I was just too stubborn, too blind to see
That I would lose your love, boy
Just tell me how to get you back
'Cause I could never lose your love
Don't wanna lose your love
Don't wanna lose your love
