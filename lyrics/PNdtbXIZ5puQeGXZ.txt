See my love is asleep on the floor,
In a pose that's familiar.
See my son will just send you to war,
If the battle don't kill you.
I've a change in mind,
Calling all the time.

But I dont want to live at your side
Though the rose is vermillion,
'Cause I find it so hard to survive,
Without when within you,
My sweet Lavinia.

All my children asleep on the floor,
In a fire in the winter.
I don't know if I've been there before,
But the colour's familiar.
I've an age in mind
Calling all the time,
For my sweet Lavinia.

My sweet Lavinia.
For my sweet Lavinia.
My sweet...

My sweet Lavinia.
My sweet Lavinia.
My sweet Lavinia.
My sweet Lavinia.

Ohh. Ohh.

(Alternate Verse (live version):
All the years buried under the floor and the wounds in the parlours
Would have come up to greet us before if it werent for my heart cause
Give her name in mind its calling all the time)
