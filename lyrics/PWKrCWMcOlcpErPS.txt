thirsty and miserable
you drop to the floor
you drink 'til you can't
even see any more

thirsty and miserable
always wanting more
thirsty and miserable
always wanting more

my brother wants a ride
to the liquor store
you pity him
for what he wants it for

thirsty and miserable
always wanting more
thirsty and miserable
always wanting more

it's 1: 30
and we're all getting nervous
the store closes at two
there's not enough to last us

thirsty and miserable
always wanting more
thirsty and miserable
always wanting more
