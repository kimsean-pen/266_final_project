Ballerina palm reader sitting on the stairs
Telling you the future you shouldn't be aware of
Ballerina palm reader sitting on the stairs
Telling you the future you shouldn't be aware of

The seven seas I hear
As blue eyes disappear
You'll cross the hemispheres
And now is always near

In time
In time

Ballerina palm reader sitting on the stairs
Telling you the future you shouldn't be aware of
Ballerina palm reader sitting on the stairs
Telling you the future you shouldn't be aware of

You'll walk the longest pier
The Alpine skies will clear
Riddles never fear
And now is always near

In time
In time

Ballerina palm reader staring at your face
Pupils are dilating, will you find your way?
