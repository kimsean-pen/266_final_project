Everything is so complex
Everyday is like a test full of obstacles that seem almost impossible
And I'm thinking, just another breath
Not a minute left
How long have I been drifting

Pass the glass pipe, hit the flashlight, now I break it
People say I'm a star but I still think I'll never make it
And I'm thinking, just another prayer
Not a second left
I feel there's something missing

Sometimes I hate that chaos surrounds me
When all the answers that I seek are around me
Am I drowning?
Am I fading away?
Or am I livin' up to all your dreams that made me this way?
Am I drowning?
Am I drowning?
Am I drowning?
Am I drowning?

I've been to hell and back
Lookin' for the answers to life
Lookin' at myself trying to get things right
And I'm feelin', just another breath
Not a minute left
I feel the darkness lifting

There was a time that I questioned if I'll ever be all right
Running getting high, staying tracked by sleepless nights
And I'm thinking, just another breath
Not a minute left
I feel there's something missing
I'm running from myself and all the things I don't like
Livin' every night like it's the last night
And I'm thinking, just another prayer
Not a second left
I need to stop resisting

Sometimes I hate that chaos surrounds me
When all the answers that I seek are around me
Am I drowning?
Am I fading away?
Or am I livin' up to all your dreams that made me this way?
Am I drowning?
Am I drowning?
Am I drowning?
Am I drowning?

Drowning in the drama, lost in the light
Trapped by the currents of life, caught in the riptide
Drowning in the drama, lost in the light
Trapped by the currents of life, caught in the riptide
Drowning in the drama, lost in the light
Trapped by the currents of life, caught in the riptide
Drowning in the drama, lost in the light
Trapped by the currents of life

Am I drowning?
Am I drowning?
Am I drowning?
Am I drowning?

Sometimes I hate that chaos surrounds me
When all the answers that I seek are around me
Am I drowning?
Am I fading away?
Or am I livin' up to all your dreams that made me this way?
Drowning in the drama, lost in the light
Trapped by the currents of life, caught in the riptide
Drowning in the drama, lost in the light
Trapped by the currents of life, caught in the riptide
