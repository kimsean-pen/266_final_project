Why do your feet stick to the ground
But your head, instead floats like a balloon
We make no accidental sound
As your mind resigns, spit the truth

Space
Space

Look at these cats they run the town
Try to paint it red, still you get the blues
A dusty a star that's fading out
Take the stage, there's no time to lose

I'll pick you up on the way to space
I'll pick you up on the way to space
I'll pick you up, pick you up take your breath away

Big sky, lots of room
I'm right there with you
Room for me, room for you
We're on our way to space
On the way to space

Space
Space

I'll pick you up on the way to space
I'll pick you up on the way to space
I'll pick you up, pick you up take your breath away

Big sky, lots of room
I'm right there with you
Room for me, room for you
We're on our way to space
On the way to space
Big sky, lots of room
I'm right there with you
Room for me, room for you
We're on our way to space
On the way to space
