I would dare you, but I know I don't need to.
You're going to do just what you want to.
You're going to take the leading chair at the fairground
You're going to sing the praises of your fruit

Mine smell like honey, uhh
Mine smell like honey, uhh
Mine smell like huh huh huh huh
honey, uhh

Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper
Climb a mountain, climb it steeper, steeper
Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper
Track a trail of honey through it all

If the end comes faster than we had expected
And predictions lead us to the final fall
If the flowers crack the grain, and weave,
the pattern of the pavement
I can hear you shouting over it all

Mine smell like honey, uhh
Mine smell like honey, uhh
Mine smell like huh huh huh huh
honey, uhh

Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper
Climb a mountain, climb it steeper, steeper
Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper
Track a trail of honey through it all

Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper
Climb a mountain, climb it steeper, steeper
Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper
Track a trail of honey through it all

You track a trail of honey through it all
You track a trail of honey
