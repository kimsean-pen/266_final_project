With the money from her accident
She bought herself a mobile home
So at least she could get some enjoyment out of being alone
No one could say that she was left up on the shelf
"It's you and me against the world, kid", she mumbled to herself

When the world falls apart some things stay in place
Levi stubbs' tears run down his face

She ran away from home with her mother's best coat
She was married before she was even entitled to vote
And her husband was one of those blokes
The sort that only laughs at his own jokes
The sort that war takes away
And when there wasn't a war he left her anyway

When the world falls apart some things stay in place
Levi stubbs' tears run down his face

Norman Whitfield and Barratt Strong
Are here to make right everything that's wrong
Holland and Holland and Lamont Dozier too
Are here to make it all okay with you

And one dark night he came home from the sea
And put a hole in her body where no hole should be
It hurt her more to see him walking out the door
And though they stitched her back together
They left her heart in pieces on the floor

When the world falls apart some things stay in place
She takes off the Four Tops tape and puts it back in its case

And when the world falls apart some things stay in place
Levi stubbs' tears
