The black sun sets in the horizon
Where the sane of my being lies upon
Ancient rituals inflicting evil power
Speaking native barbarian tongue
Awake the creature sleeping inside of me
Devour my soul grant me immortality

Damned to a relentless evocation
The rebirth of a baneful beast I behold
Decipher the wolf's bloody oath
Darkned secrets of the lycanthropist code

Herald of the venomous spell of my father's demonic fate
The harvest moon surround me like a cold embrace
I feel the freezing winds deforming and slashing my face
I feel the scent of death of 1000 graves

Bleeding moon, bleeding eyes, demonized
Leather-like skin animalized
The rupture of my skeleton and flesh impaling so painfully
Sharp-like razor claws, jawbreaker, night stalking carnivore

Incite the animal within
Caught myself dreaming I was howling
Shepherd of death
Eviscerate the lambs of the fields devouring
Lock up your daughters tight
There's a hunger wolf at the door

The black sun sets in the horizon
Where the sane of my being lies upon
Ancient rituals inflicting evil power
Speaking native barbarian tongue
Awake the creature sleeping inside of me
Devour my soul grant me immortality

Damned to a relentless evocation
The rebirth of a baneful beast I behold
Decipher the wolf's bloody oath
Darkned secrets of the lycanthropist code

Herald of the venomous spell of my father's demonic fate
The harvest moon surround me like a cold embrace
I feel the freezing winds deforming and slashing my face
I feel the scent of death of 1000 graves
