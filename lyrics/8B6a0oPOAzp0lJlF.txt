I was up this mornin', blues walkin' like a man
I was up this mornin', blues walkin' like a man
Worried blues, give me your right hand

Ah, blues fell mama's child, tore me all upside down
Blues fell mama's child, tore me all upside down
Travel on ol' Jeffrey Lee, ya know
Can't seem to turn him around

So preach the blues
Preach the blues now

Blues is low down shaking chill
Blues is low down shaking chill
You ain't never had them
I don't believe you will

Blues is an achin' old heart disease
Blues is an achin' old heart disease
It's like consumption, baby
Killin' me by degrees

So preach the blues
Preach the blues now

I had religion, Lord, this day, very day
I had religion, Lord, this very day
But the womens and the whiskey
They would not let me pray

Gonna get me religion
Gonna join the Baptist church
Gonna get me religion
Gonna join the Baptist church
Gonna be a Baptist preacher
So I don't have to work

And preach the blues
And preach the blues now
