Yes, I stumbled into the night
We're touching, but I feel like you are still out of reach
The people here are buzzing like a bug on a light
I'm feeling like I always see them, but they can't see me

Sentimental feelings
Never get me anywhere
My heart continues beating
Is there anybody, anybody?

Hello, hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go, as everyone lets go of me
Oh-oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone
No, oh

Yeah, I'm combing through this desert of stone
These faces on these statues that I used to know
Wishing I was more than what my story has told
Or hoping that I'm dreaming in the day and this isn't happening
Gotta keep it all together
Longing for a hand to hold
Keep clear of the shadows
Is there anybody, anybody?

Hello, hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go, as everyone lets go of me
Oh-oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone
No, oh

Holding on to the memories of when I, I didn't know
Ignorance isn't wise, but it beats being alone
Yeah!
Ooh, yeah!

Hello
Is anybody listening? (hello)
Let go, as everyone lets go of me
Oh-oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone (won't somebody, won't somebody?)
No, oh

Hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go, as everyone lets go of me
Oh-oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone (show me that I'm not alone)
No, oh
