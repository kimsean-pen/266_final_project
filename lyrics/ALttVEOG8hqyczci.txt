I don't think it's safe,
I'm laying face down on the ground
It was an eye-opener to who they were
I don't think it's fair
I lay my brave heart on the ground
It was a public war, that's who they are

I think I'll stick with you
'Cause you save me everyday
On this playground
So I shout your name again
From the rooftops
From the rooftops

I don't think it's safe
They don't want to see us pulling through
I need a godsend cure and that's what you are
I don't think it's fair
I was the target everyday
It was a constant threat
But there you were

I think I'll stick with you
'Cause you save me everyday
On this playground
So I shout your name again
From the rooftops
