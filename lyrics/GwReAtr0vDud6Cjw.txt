Feel like an old railroad man
Ridin' out on the bluemont line
Hummin' along old dominion blues
Not much to see and not much left to lose
And i know i can walk along the tracks
It may take a little longer but i'll know
How to find my way back

I feel like an old railroad man
Who's really tried the best that he can
To make his life add up to something good
But this engine no longer burns on wood
And i guess i may never understand
The times that i live in
Are not made for a railroad man

I feel like an old railroad man
Getting on board at the end of an age
The station's empty and the whistle blows
Things are faster now
And this train is just too slow
And i know i can walk along the tracks
It may take a little longer but i'll know
How to find my way back
