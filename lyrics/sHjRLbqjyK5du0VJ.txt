Don't say it's like a fantasy
When you know this is how it should be
You kiss me, I'm falling
Can you hear me calling
You touch me, I want you
Feels like I've always known you

On a night like this
I want to stay forever (stay forever)
On a night like this
Just want to be together
On a night like this

Now I'm getting closer to you
Hold me, I just can't be without you
You kiss me, I'm falling
It's your name I'm calling
You touch me, I want you
Feels like I've always known you

On a night like this
I want to stay forever (stay forever)
On a night like this
Just want to be together
On a night like this

Seems I've known you a lifetime (lifetime)
Now it's time to make you mine
On a night like this
On a night like this (oh)

(You kiss me, I'm falling)
(You touch me)

On a night like this
Just want to be together

On a night like this
I want to stay forever (stay forever)
On a night like this
Just want to be together (oh)
On a night like this

(You kiss me, I'm falling)
(You touch me)
On a night like this

(You kiss me, I'm falling)
(You touch me)
On a night like this

(You kiss me, I'm falling)
(You touch me)
On a night like this
