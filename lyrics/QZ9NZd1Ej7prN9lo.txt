Something's bugging me, wanna stay out late, late at night
And this time of year, too much ooh, too much memories
Ooh ooh
My friends say, you gotta, oh, get over
It's just the darkness, don't make your feelings too complex
It's just a one man, you have the love light in you
It's just the beginning, it'll be comin' around again
Wintertime's not for the lonely
It always hits to the heart
And all the places he used to take me
And all the kissing in the dark
I go places, I go places I don't really wanna go
I see people, holding hands
I think I saw his face, is it him getting over there?
Is he close, is he close to me?
My friends say, it's just the love light in you (in you)

It's just a one man, it'll be comin' around again
Wintertime's not for the lonely (ooh)
It always hits to the heart (ooh)
And all the places he used to take me (used to take me, oh)
And all the kissing in the dark (and all the kiss)
Wintertime's not for the lonely (ooh)
It always hits to the heart (ooh)
And all the places he used to take me (used to take me, oh)
And all the kissing in the dark (and all the kiss)
Oh oh oh -
I'm feeling older this winter
And my eyes are growing dark
And everybody wants the singing
I left that song long ago
(I can't have him, I can't have him)
(I'm feeling older,...)
(I can't have him, I can't have him)
