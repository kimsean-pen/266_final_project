I come to your door
to see you again
but where you once stood
was an old man instead
I asked where you'd be
he said
"she's moved on you see
all I have is a number
you'd better ask her not me"
so I picked up the phone
and dialled your number
not sure to put it down or speak
then a voice I once knew answered
in a sweet voice
she said hello and then paused
before I began to speak
babe (babe) I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (babe)
where have you been (where have you been)
babe (babe) I'm back again
I tell you I'm back again (babe)
where have you been

you held your voice well
there were tears I could tell
but where were you now
was you gonna tell me in time
just give me a town
and I'll be straight down

I've got so much to tell you
about where I have been
as I walk down your road
I can't wait to be near you

(I) I can't keep (I) the feeling inside
(I can't keep it inside)
as I stand at your door
you answer in a sweet voice
you say hello then pause
before I begin to speak

babe (babe) I'm here again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm here again (babe)
where have you been (where have you been)
babe (babe) I'm back again
I tell you I'm back again (babe)
where have you been

as you looked away
I saw a face behind you
a little boy stood at your door
(boy stood at your door)
and when I looked again
I saw his face
was shining
he had my eyes (my eyes)
he had my smile (my smile)

babe (babe) I'm back again (I'm here again)
I tell you I'm back again (babe)
I'll be here for you
(where have you been)

babe (babe) please take me back (I'm back again)
take me back (babe)
back home again

babe (babe) please hold me close (I'm here again)
hold me close (babe)
like you used to do (where have you been)

babe (babe) just me and you (I'm back again)
you and me (babe)
