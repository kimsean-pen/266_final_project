Remember that night
White steps in the moonlight
They walked it too
Through empty playground, this ghost's town
Children again on rusting swings getting higher
Sharing a dream
On an island, it felt right

We lay side by side
Between the moon and the tide
Mapping the stars for a while

Let the night surround you
We're half way to the stars
Ebb and flow
Let it grow, feel the warmth beside you

Remember that night
The warmth and the laughter
Candles burn
Though the church was deserted
At dawn we went down through empty streets to the harbour
Dreamers may leave, but they're here everafter

Let the night surround you
We're half way to the stars
Ebb and flow
Let it go, feel the warmth beside you
