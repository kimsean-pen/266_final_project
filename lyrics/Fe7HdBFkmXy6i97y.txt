In the days when they were nights
I would burn just like a firefly
Out of touch, and out of sight
I was wrong, but I was doing it right

We would drink the blood of sleep
We would drink until we couldn't speak
And I could still hear 'em calling to me, baby

Come back to me
Come back with me
Back to when we were young
And making out in the mouth of the devil
Yeah, come back to me
Yeah, come back with me
Back to when we were numb
Just bleeding out in the mouth of the devil

In the days that turned to dust
I couldn't love so I would run for lust
I couldn't feel so I would touch
A sea of flesh but it was never enough

And we would steal each other's grief
We were thin but we were thick as thieves
And I could still hear 'em calling to me, baby

Come back to me
Come back with me
Back to when we were young
And making out in the mouth of the devil
Yeah, come back to me
Yeah, come back with me
Back to when we were numb
Just bleeding out in the mouth of the devil

You gotta hold me down
You gotta hold me back
Cause I might slip into
Slip into the black

You gotta hold me down
You gotta hold me back
Cause I might slip away
Slip into the past

Come back to me
Come back with me
Back to when we were young
And making out in the mouth of the devil
Yeah, come back to me
Yeah, come back with me
Back to when we were numb
Just bleeding out in the mouth of the devil

Yeah, come back, I know you wanna
Yeah, come back, I know you wanna
Get back to when we were young
And making out in the mouth of the devil
Yeah, come back, I know you wanna
Yeah, come back, I know you wanna
Get back to when we were numb
Just bleeding out in the mouth of the devil
