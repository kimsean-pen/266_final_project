His space crowds out your space, your space
His space crowds out hers
Coffee breath and headphone hiss
But no one says a word
Eyes upon the paper headline
Refuge in your phone
Bumping shoulders
Cough and sniff
But no one says hello
Excuse me while I run
I really gotta get out of here
Excuse me while I run
I really gotta get out of here
My heart beats like yours does, hers does
My heart keeps good time
And every day I mind the gap between you and me
Here comes someone else to share the air we breathe
Excuse me while I run
I really gotta get out of here
Reach out for anyone
And they will tell you get outta here
I'm asking everyone
You gotta help me get out of here
Excuse me while I run
I really gotta get out of here
Meanwhile
Under the gun
Hey everyone
Our work here is done
We out
You gonna come?
Hey everyone
Our work here is done
Excuse me while I run
I really gotta get out of here
Reach out for anyone
And they will tell you get out of here
I'm asking everyone
You gotta help me get out of here
Excuse me while I run
I really gotta get out of here
