Sentimental days in a misty clouded haze
Of a memory that now feels untrue
I used to feel disguised, now I leave the mask behind
Painting pictures that aren't so blue

The pages I've turned are the lessons I learned

Somebody bring up the lights, I want you to see
(Don't you feel sorry for me)
My life turned around, but I'm still living my dreams
(Yes, it's true that I've been)

Through it all
I've hit about a million walls
Welcome to my truth, I still love
Welcome to my truth, I still love

Tangled in a web with a pain hard to forget
That was a time that I've now put to rest

The pages I've turned are the lessons I learned

Somebody bring up the lights, I want you to see
(Don't you feel sorry for me)
My life turned around, but I'm still living my dreams
(Yes, it's true that I've been)

Through it all
I've hit about a million walls
Welcome to my truth, I still love
Welcome to my truth, I still love

I still love, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
And you know that I still love, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sentimental days in a misty clouded haze
Of a memory that now feels untrue

Somebody bring up the lights, I want you to see
(Don't you feel sorry for me)
My life turned around, but I'm still living my dreams
(Yes, it's true that I've been)

Through it all
I've hit about a million walls
Welcome to my truth, I still love

Oh, somebody bring up the lights, I want you to see
(Don't you feel sorry for me)
My life turned around, but I'm still living my dreams
(Yes, it's true that I've been)

I still, I still love
(Yes, it's true that I've been)
I still, I still love
