Sweet dreams
Let me lay here down
Hold your breath
Don't make a sound
Baby, oh, say, can you sleep?
I've been getting pretty good
At counting sheep

I am the very specimen
Of a sleepwalking gentleman
If I die before I wake
Save my dreams for another day

'Cause tonight
I've got nothing on my mind but you
Somewhere, somehow
You'll feel it too
Ooh, don't you take a bow at the
Last curtain call
Thinking you're nobody's
Nothing after all
(Nothing after all)

Sweet dreams
Let me lay here down
Hope your feet don't touch the ground
It's getting late why can't I sleep
I've been getting pretty good
At counting sheep

I am the very specimen
Of a sleepwalking gentleman
If I die before I wake
Save my dreams for another day

'Cause tonight
I've got nothing on my mind but you
Somewhere, somehow
You'll feel it too
Ooh, don't you take a bow at the
Last curtain call
Thinking you're nobody's
Nothing after all
(Nothing after all)
You're somebody's
Something after all
(Something after all)

Tonight!
I've got nothing on my mind but you
Somewhere, somehow
You'll feel it too
Ooh, don't you take a bow at the
Last curtain call
Thinking you're nobody's
Nothing after all
You're somebody's
Something after all
You're somebody's
Something after all
