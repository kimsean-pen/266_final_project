My life is a broken mirror, forever, forever picking up the pieces
My will is broken, I'd give anything to defeat this

A pill to make me smile, a pill to help me sleep
A drink to calm the nerves that keep me feeling weak
I'm meant to be a man, but I can't carry everything

On my own, counting on a wishbone
Oh, I sink so low, tell me, will I ever make it out of here?
On my own, counting on a wishbone, where did I go wrong?
And tell me, will I ever make it out of here? On my own

On my own, counting on a wishbone
On my own
My life is a broken record

Failure, failure, failure, failure on repeat
My mind is a crippled horse, running circles around me
My self-worth has faded, and I have become jaded
I look at the world with tired eyes, filled with hatred

A pill to make me smile, a pill to help me sleep
A drink to calm the nerves that keep me feeling weak
I'm meant to be a man, but I can't carry everything

On my own, counting on a wishbone
Oh, I sink so low, tell me, will I ever make it out of here?
On my own, counting on a wishbone, where did I go wrong?
And tell me will I ever make it out of here? On my own

Should I just set myself on fire? Burn
I won't make it out alive
I won't make it out alive
The world keeps on turning
My mind keeps on burning, burn
I won't make it out alive

I'm meant to be a man but I can't carry everything

On my own, counting on a wishbone
Oh, I sink so low, tell me, will I ever make it out of here?
On my own, counting on a wishbone, where did I go wrong?
And tell me will I ever make it out of here?
