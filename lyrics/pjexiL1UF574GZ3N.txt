Beautiful day, wonderful feeling,
I feel like singing, Psalms*
Meaning songs singing praises
All day long. Joy fills the weak,
Joy makes us strong. Filled 'till we
Burst, songs of praise to the God
Of the Universe.

Despite our selfish selves,
Despite all loss of hope,
Despite our lack of faith,
Despite our stony hearts,
Despite the waning moon,
Despite the ebbing tide of how we think this world should be.

Praise God from whom all blessings flow,
Praise Him all creatures here below,
Praise Him above ye heavenly host,
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

Gray rainy day,
Down in the mud for us.
Don't feel I can sing
Songs to the God in control of the Seasons.
What's good and†bad,
Flow from the hands,
Of the God with the perfect plan.
Filled with joy all of this will glorify.‡

Despite our selfish selves,

Praise God from whom all blessings flow,

Praise Him above ye heavenly host,
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
