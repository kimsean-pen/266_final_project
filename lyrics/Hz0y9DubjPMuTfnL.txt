Lookin' at the devil, grinnin' at his gun
fingers start shakin', i begin to run
Bullets start chasin', i begin to stop
we begin to wrestle i was on the top
Want to thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
i wanna thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Stiff all in the collar, fluffy in the face
chit chat chatter tryin', i begin to run
Want to thank you for the party, i could never stay
many thangs is on my mind, words in the way
Want to thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Dance to the music
all nite long
everyday people
sing a simple song
Mama's so happy
mama start to cry
papa still singin'
you can make it if you try
I want to thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Flamin' eyes of people fear, burnin' into you
many men are missin' much, hatin' what they do
Youth and truth are makin' love
dig it for a starter
dyin' young is hard to take
sellin' out is harder
I want to thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
