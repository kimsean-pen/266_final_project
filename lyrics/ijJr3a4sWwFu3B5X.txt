You give me the shakes
You give me the cold sweats
You're giving me reasons to turn my tear drops
Into death threats

You're going straight to machine
So I kiss my brothers
I never took off my chains
They never took my colors

Take 'em on in the morning love
I'm digging deep for my midas touch
We could be chasing the waves
I know it isn't much

Let it drop
Let it drop
Let it drop
People don't make it easy
Let it drop
Let it drop
People don't make it easy
Let it drop

Isn't it strange
The way you move me so
You love me with hot hammers
And then your blood runs cold

For my next trick
Gonna be like: where she go?
Make an exit
like adios amigo

It got too complicated
Cool it down and refridgerate it
We could be lassoing the stars
But people don't make it easy

Let it drop
Let it drop
Let it drop
Let it drop
People don't make it easy
Let it drop
Let it drop
Let it drop
People don't make it easy
Let it drop
Let it drop
Let it drop
Let it drop
People don't make it easy
