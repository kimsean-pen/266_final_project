Break the mould
Ignore the signs
Many roads we can take while running through this lifetime
We were told
The wrong and right
But we won't find the truth while walking down that straight line

So tell me why you're scared of trying this time, this time
I think you should dream in color tonight, tonight

You can reach up for the stars
Or wait here until they fall
We all know life is hard
But we try, we try, we try

We can build
And paint the way
Just in case you forget you know it's never too late, oh
Down the hatch
Enjoy the days
Both the sour and sweet, don't let anything go to waste

So tell me why you're scared of trying this time, this time
I think you should dream in color tonight, tonight

You can reach up for the stars
Or wait here until they fall
We all know life is hard
But we try, we try, we try
You can reach up for the stars
Or wait here until they fall
We all know life is hard
But we try, we try, we try

We can reach up for the stars
Because we all know life is hard

You can reach up for the stars
Or wait here until they fall
We all know life is hard
But we try, we try, we try
