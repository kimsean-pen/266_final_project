I don't know about you but I'm tired
Running after you
Putting out fires
You're waiting for something
That won't come for nothing
Maybe it's not me
Maybe it's not me
In the heat of the moment
When you're wide eyed and broken
Are you thinking of me?
Are you thinking of me?

So tell me a lie
Tell me you were high
Let me know why
Do anything it takes
Tell me it was a mistake
Tell me how your heart breaks
It meant nothing anyway
Say anything to make me stay
But you
Say nothing
But you
Say nothing

You look so confused
Don't you try
To twist the truth
And get inside my mind
Yourself
We're on our last strike
That thin line
You're so under the pressure
With nothing else left
Are you thinking of me?
Are you thinking of me?

So tell me a lie
Tell me you were high
Let me know why
Do anything it takes
Tell me it was a mistake
Tell me how your heart breaks
It meant nothing anyway
Say anything to make me
Stay
But you
Say nothing
But you
Say nothing

Tell me are you in there?
Give me a sign
Nothing's gonna make this right
This time
I know that you're in there
Where do you hide?
This time
I only came to say goodbye
But you
Said nothing

So tell me a lie
Tell me you were high
Let me know why
Tell me anything it takes
Tell me it was a mistake
Tell me how your heart breaks
It meant nothing anyway
Do anything to make me
Stay
But you
Say nothing
You say nothing
Do anything to make me stay
But you say
But you
Say nothing
Do anything to make me stay
But you say
