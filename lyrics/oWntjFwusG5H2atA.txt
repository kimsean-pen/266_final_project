Can I talk to you?
This might take a little while
We've been so confused
We need to work this out
I've been away from you and I know it's been some time
It's not fair to you, so I need to break it down

I could be stuck in LA
You might get a late call from New York
I try to send a kiss to where you are, but it just seems too far
I could be off to Tokyo, ATL, then Paris and back home
So I just can't be where you are and it's breakin' my heart

I don't wanna want you
Keep tellin' myself that I don't want you
But I can't have you
It's crazy
It's gettin' so hard to stay away from you
But I still miss you
I don't wanna want you
Keep tellin' myself that I don't want you
But I wanna call you
To say I'm sorry I can't be the one for you
'Cause I can't be with you

We may not survive
The stress gets a little hard
We lead two different lives
And spend most of it apart
Tell me what to do to make it up to you
Maybe we should stop
Before this goes too far

I could be stuck in LA

I don't wanna want you
Keep tellin' myself that I don't want you

To say I'm sorry I can't be the one for you
Cause I can't be with you

Maybe we'd be better off
Not lettin' this get serious
I can't give you want you want (No...)
Maybe we should break it off
I don't wanna fall in love
Help me figure out

I don't wanna want you
Keep tellin' myself that I don't want you (Yeah, yeah)
But I can't have you
It's crazy
It's gettin' so hard to stay away from you
But I still miss you
I don't wanna want you
Keep tellin' myself that I don't want you
But I wanna call you
To say I'm sorry I can't be the one for you
'Cause I can't be with you

(Yeah, oh, yeah)
I don't wanna want you
Keep tellin' myself that I don't want you
But I can't have you
It's crazy
It's gettin' so hard to stay away from you
But I still miss you
I don't wanna want you (Ooh)
Keep tellin' myself that I don't want you (Oh, woah, oh)
But I wanna call you
To say I'm sorry I can't be the one for you
'Cause I can't be with you

I can't be... Oh...
I don't wanna...
I can't be...

I don't wanna...
