I don't know the cunts you used to hang around with
I don't care for their names or what they did
I just see you floating like a deity in a dress
Are you looking for me? Are you looking for me?

'Cause you don't have to change
You are not a little fish
You don't have to swim upstream to find their praise

'Cause I love you exactly how you are
I love you exactly how you are
I love you exactly how you are
I love you exactly how you are

There's no romance in this shit facility
Tired arms reach out at swinging branches
I see phonies in their room for improvement
Are you looking for me? Are you looking for me?

'Cause you don't have to change
You are not a little fish
You don't have to swim upstream to find their praise

'Cause I love you exactly how you are
I love you exactly how you are
I love you exactly how you are
I love you exactly how you are

I love you exactly how you are
I love you exactly how you are
I love you exactly how you are
I love you exactly how you are
