From the day I was born
I took the bull by the horns
And gave you plenty to scorn, well right on!
Then you said in a song
That life was gettin' real tough
But hey I think that you're bluffing, what of it?
Introduce yourself right on!

Now two decades gone
By and I know that's a long time
Para tiempo means nada nunca
Cause I'm still the same asshole
And I still wet my pants
Every time that I see your face (who are you?)

Introduce yourself right on!

Hey Mr. Biggs
Hey Mr. Bestall
Hey Mr. Warner what's up?
Hey Mr. Enigma
Hey Mr. Bigtime
Hey Mr. Epic, What's going on?
Introduce yourself right on!
