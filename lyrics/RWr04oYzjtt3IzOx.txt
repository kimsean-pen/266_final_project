Can't stand the way you look
Can't stand the way you talk
Can't stand the way you act
Can't stand you

Do I think you're a dick? Yeah!
Do I think you're a fuck? Yeah!
Do I think we'll fight? Yeah!
Do I think you'll win? No!

Do I think you're stupid? Yeah!
Do I think you're lame? Yeah!
Am I stressing?
You're the one to blame

Can't stand the way you look
Can't stand the way you talk
Can't stand the way you act
Can't stand you

Do I think you're a shit? Yeah!
Do I think you're a fuck? Yeah!
Do I think we'll fight? Yeah!
Do I think you'll win? No!

Do I think you're stupid? Yeah!
Do I think you're lame? Yeah!
Am I stressing?
You're the one to blame

I open my mouth at the wrong time
Always ranking on somebody, I'm drunk all the time
Throwing beer bottles and spitting in your face
Checking through the purse of the slut in our place
She'll never notice if her money is gone
Piss in her jacket and just send her along

Can't stand the way you look
Can't stand the way you talk
Can't stand the way you act
Can't stand you

Do I think you're a shit? Yeah!
Do I think you're a fuck? Yeah!
Do I think we'll fight? Yeah!
Do I think you'll win? No!

Do I think you're stupid? Yeah!
Do I think you're lame? Yeah!
Am I stressing?
You're the one to blame
