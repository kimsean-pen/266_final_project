Stay with me, baby stay with me
Tonight don't leave me alone
Walk with me, come & walk with me
To the edge of all we've ever known

I can see you there with the city lights
Fourteenth floor, pale blue eyes
I can breathe you in

Two shadows standing by the bedroom door
No, I could not want you more than I did right then
As our heads leaned in

Well, I'm not sure what this is gonna be
But with my eyes closed all I see is the skyline, through the window
The moon above you & the streets below
Hold my breath as you're moving in
Taste your lips & feel your skin
When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly

Stay with me, baby stay with me
Tonight don't leave me alone
She shows me everything she used to know
Picture frames & country roads

When the days were long & the world was small
She stood by as it fell apart
Separate rooms & broken hearts
But I won't be the one to let you go

Oh, I'm not sure what this is gonna be
But with my eyes closed all I see is the skyline, through the window
The moon above you & the streets below
Hold my breath as you're moving in
Taste your lips & feel your skin
When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly

Don't run away...

And it's hard to love again
When the only way it's been
When the only love you know
Just walked away

If it's something that you want
Darling you don't have to run
You don't have to go
Just stay with me, baby stay with me

Well, I'm not sure what this is gonna be
But with my eyes closed all I see is the skyline, through the window
The moon above you & the streets below (Don't let go)
Hold my breath as you're moving in
Taste your lips & feel your skin
When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly

I'm not sure where this is gonna go
But in this moment all I know is the skyline, through the window
The moon above you & the streets below (Baby, don't let go)
Hold my breath as you're moving in
Taste your lips & feel your skin
When the time comes, baby don't run, just kiss me slowly
