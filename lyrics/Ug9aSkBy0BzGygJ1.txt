May Days, Throwaways - some things here have got to stay
A string of pearls, the strangest girl - happy with the Western world

Painless Chinese burns
Ties me down with daisy chains
Diamonds on her tongue
Pleasure cuts and teasing

M'aidez - this is no m'aidez
Open charms are lost on velvet
Maybe this is no m'aidez, m'aidez

Dead zones and half-way homes, still life lived on mobile phones
But the girl had wings and precious things, under sheets with tangled limbs

Wide awake at dawn
The sun will choose to shine on
Silence says it all
Reaching out and blessing

M'aidez - this is no m'aidez
Open charms are lost on velvet
Maybe this is no m'aidez, m'aidez

The higher we climb, the smaller we seem - mad with possibilities
No design, a zigzag girl - happy with the Western world

Painless Chinese burns
Ties me down with daisy chains
Diamonds on her tongue
Pleasure cuts and teasing

M'aidez - this is no m'aidez
Open charms are lost on velvet
Maybe this is no m'aidez, m'aidez
