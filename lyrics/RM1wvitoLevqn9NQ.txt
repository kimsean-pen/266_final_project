Oh yes, this is all I've ever known
I'm trouble, can't be on my own
Rock bottom, every day
Dreamed to drown, throw my life away
Grow into comatose
Serenity with no memories to own
And the games within my mind
You're at peace, but all alone, but all alone

Was there a sign I didn't read? Or was I lying to myself?
Holding fast to every skeleton I've got there on the shelf
I just tried to make them drown, drown every skeleton around
It's just another bottle down, it's just another bottle down, fuck
It's just another bottle down

I tried my hardest to be free
But I was trapped by my anxiety
Now back into the fold
Now back into the fight
Chasing demons from their hideouts
Cast the mountains to the light
Don't throw my body to the landfill
Don't throw my body to the sea
'Cause I'm not ready yet
I won't be just a fucking memory

Was there a sign I didn't read? Or was I lying to myself?
Holding fast to every skeleton I've got there on the shelf
I just tried to make them drown, drown every skeleton around
It's just another bottle down, it's just another bottle down

If I smash all of the bottles that built the shackles on my mind
Could I let go of all the pain eating me from the inside?

Death will never bring me down
When I die, I will die fighting
Death will never bring me down
When I die, I will die fighting
Death will never bring me down
When I die, I will die fighting
Death will never

Was there a sign I didn't read? Or was I lying to myself?
Holding fast to every skeleton I've got there on the shelf
I just tried to make them drown, drown every skeleton around
It's just another bottle down, it's just another bottle down
It's just another bottle down
