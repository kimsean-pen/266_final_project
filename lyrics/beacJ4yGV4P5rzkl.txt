If you could get the women into one,
you could get them involved in one
thing, you could see them in this other light
And then they started questioning other aspects of
their own, not just relating to themselves, or, at yourself
Politics was just something that wouldn't affect me,
but politics is life,
and everything to do with it affects you, directly or indirectly
A lot of women weren't as fortunate as me,
they weren't taught to wire a plug, they were taught to make a sponge
They weren't taught how to change a wheel on a car,
they were taught the proper way to iron a white shirt
You can't climb up this tree, you're a girl
You can't come with us 'cause you're a girl
And it made me damned determined to do it.
And I suppose it sort of stuck with me
So I didn't see any reason why I
shouldn't be out there doing what I was doing
Why I shouldn't work with them
Why I shouldn't found a support group
I think a lot of women found their feet
I've been in front, I have never give in
I have never sat back, and I have never refused anybody
And I am very proud of it
And I'll be proud to look back on it
