Here you come along
I take a breath and remind myself that I too can be strong
Thought I was cool
Turns out I'm a fool
Clearly you've proved me wrong
I didn't know what I was missing when I was alone

And now I'm fruitlessly waiting for someone not thinking
Before they start rushing to my door
Someone to run not walk
Someone to sing not talk
Oh, no hesitation at all
Sometimes I need you to be the one to call

Well, I'm lost in my thoughts
They tumbled ahead
Over and over again
Yeah, it's true
Just take a look at what's been done to me
I wasted time to ponder
Here I am, oh, Alice in wonder
Partly I do this to myself
But why can't you see
The gesture is small
But know that it means the world to me
Forgive me for wanting
I'm only learning life
Forgiven myself and now there's no returning
I want to be the one who knows the best way
To love you

But now I'm foolishly waiting for
Someone not thinking before they start rushing to my door
Someone to run not walk
Someone to sing not talk
Oh, no hesitation at all
Sometimes I need you to be the one to call
I need you to be the one
