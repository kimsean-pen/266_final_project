Come home
Its been so long
We're missing you at home
So hang up that phone
'Cause I'm coming back home
Back home

Come home
It's been so long
I can hide no more
So hang up that phone
'Cause I'm coming back home
Back home

Drive me home
Drive me home
Drive me home
Drive me, keep on driving me
Keep on driving me, keep on driving me
Keep on driving me, keep on driving me
Driving me, driving me home

Come home
It's been so long
Were missing you at home
So hang up that phone
'Cause I'm coming back home (I'm coming home)
Back home (I'm coming home)
I'm coming back home (I'm coming home)
I'm back home
