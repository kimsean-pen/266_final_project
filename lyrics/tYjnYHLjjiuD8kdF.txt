Don't be scared of anything at all
Everything we have is all we need
All the spotlights streaming into angry skies
Means there's no one watching as we leave

Say the first thing that comes into your head when you see me
If it looks like it works and it feels like it works then it works
With the sun on your face all these worries will soon disappear
Just follow me now, just follow me now

I find careful patterns in the snow
It seems you did come round but changed your mind
If you'd just take ten more steps to me
I won't ever ask you again

Just because I couldn't say doesn't make me a liar
I noticed a change in the tone of your voice it's so clear
My role in this mess is not something that I can be proud of
But it's all going to change, but it's all going to change

But it's all going to change, but it's all going to change
But it's all going to change, but it's all going to change

Say the first thing that comes into your head when you see me
If it looks like it works and it feels like it works then it works
With the sun on your face all these worries will soon disappear
Just follow me now, just follow me now
