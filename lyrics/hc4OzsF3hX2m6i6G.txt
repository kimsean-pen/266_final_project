I'll take a walk outside
and see you... know
I'll take a walk outside
It's warm outside you know

I can't see anything
It's warm outside today
I can't see anything
That could make me want to stay

You've taken another step
You've taken another step
You've taken another step away
Another step away

I see it's dark outside
It's dark outside today
I can't see anything
That could make me want to stay

But then I see you standing
Brighter than the day
And when I see you
I just walk away

You've taken another step
You've taken another step
You've taken another step away
Another step away

I'll take a picture
A picture of your smile
I'll take that picture
just to make it last a while

But there's no photograph
That can capture who you are
And when I see you I know
You're the shooting star

You've taken another step
You've taken another step
You've taken another step away
Another step away
Another step away

You've taken anotehr step x8
Away
