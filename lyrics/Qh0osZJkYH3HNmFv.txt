My Dad told me each love will be different.
My Dad told me each love will be good.
Buy my Dad's never had a broken heart,
because my Dad's got my Mum.

I'm too scared to fall in love again,
I'll just focus on my family, my art and my friends.
I'm too scared to fall in love again,
I'll just focus on anything else.

I want to be academic, confident and romantic,
but I just feel weird and overdramatic.
Daily reminders that I am pathetic.
When you're surrounded by it, it's hard to forget it.
I see your straight faces in the magazines,
the ones I used to read when I was thirteen.
Now I can't sleep for all these flashbacks.
Caravans and guys in bands and polystyrene hands.

Everything I had I seem to have lost.
Everyone who loved me seems to have forgot.
Everything I want seems to far away.
I'll just stay in bed for another day.

Hikikomori.
