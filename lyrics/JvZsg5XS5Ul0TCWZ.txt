For the longest time I though there existed a symmetry,
some unrequited love that plagued both you and me.
We were young and we were bright
And had diamonds in our eyes, when you met me on the summer's edge.
And oh, your Mother's words would always sting the worst
When they told you I was bad news.

Don't hold your breath waiting for me to be a safe bet.
Just call me out, so I can prove it to you again.

The kids we were back then,
We could never be again.
Oh, the kids we were back then,
We could never ever... never be again.

For the longest time I held on to our small-town scene,
our clothes, our cliques, the tapes we mixed,
the songs that built our friendships.
When we were young and we were bright and had diamonds in our eyes,
You kissed me on the summer's edge.
And oh, I know my words would always sting the worst
When I told you I was leaving.

Don't hold your breath waiting for me to be a safe bet.
Just call me out, so I can prove it to you again.

The kids we were back then,
We could never be again.
Oh, the kids we were back then,
We could never be again.
And all the boys and all the girls, on those days, were a miracle.
Oh, the kids we were back then,
We could never ever
Never be again.

Let the rain, let the rain fall down on me,
And let it wash, let it wash away our dreams.
Well, I can deal, I can deal with anything
As long as I have my friends with me.

The kids we were back then,
We could never be again.
The kids we were back then,
We could never ever
The kids we were back then,
We could never be again.
Oh the kids we were back then,
We could never be again.
And all the boys and all the girls, on those days, were a miracle.
Oh, the kids we were back then,
We could never ever
