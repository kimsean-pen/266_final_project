Though we've got to say good-bye for the summer
Darling, I promise you this
I'll send you all my love
Everyday in a letter
Sealed with a kiss

Yes it's gonna be a cold, lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my dreams
Everyday in a letter
Sealed with a kiss

I'll see you in the sunlight
I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run to tenderly hold you
But, Darlin' you won't be there

I don't wanna say good-bye for the summer
Knowing the love we'll miss
So let us make a pledge
To meet in September
And seal it with a kiss

Yes it's gonna be a cold, lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my love
Everyday in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a kiss
