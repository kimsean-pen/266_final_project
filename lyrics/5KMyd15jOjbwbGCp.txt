Floating through the darkness
Awaiting on transmission
Drifting on the mission alone
Why, oh poor my dear
When I could let my dear

Streaming through creation
Trying to catch a laughter
Blinded by the darkness
Alone and so it goes
My bitter heart can feel it
The distance in between
Six trillion miles away, dear
The evenings follow me

How can I explain
With no voice
With no chance
As I'm traveling upside down
Into a world of the unknown

Artificial henchmen
A sacrificial name
I'm on this one way mission lost
Exploding into stars
I am through, now I'm on the other side

I'm dying to say
I love you anyway
Even though you sent me off to die

I'm dying, I'm dying
I am yours
Warning from the other side

How can I explain
With no voice
With no chance
As I'm traveling upside down
Into a world of the unknown

How can I explain
With no hope
With no chance
As I'm traveling upside down
Into a world of the unknown

How can I explain
That I'm dying to get
I'm dying, I'm dying
I'm dying to say
I owe you, I'll see you on the other side
