You could always see yourself in me
A brand new way to live vicariously
I wanted to show you the world through my eyes
But you had to let me go, just let me go so I could live my life

We used to look at the stars, and dream of the days
We would find something more
Somewhere along the way, the smile left your face and life set in
It changed everything

We used to look at the stars, and dream of the days
We would find something more
Somewhere along the way
The smile left your face as your eyes fell
The light that once shined slowly dimmed

I wandered from the path that you chose for me
(I said I'd never let you go, but I had to)
I felt your hand slip away, as my eyes opened to see
(I didn't want to paralyze the thoughts in your head)
All the beauty in the pleasure
(Search for what you've wanted)
And all the things that I had missed
(Don't let it slip from your hands)
In a moment I was caught up in the world
(With everything that she offered me)

We used to look at the stars, and dream of the days
We would find something more
Somewhere along the way
The smile left your face as your eyes fell
It changed everything
You held me close in your arms, promised me you'd love me
No matter what I would become
It's your grace I feel everywhere
Pushing me into the unknown that I fear

You played it safe so the ones you loved could have everything
You gave yourself when there was nothing left
Even when the sky was falling down you covered me instead
You gave yourself when there was nothing left

You could always see yourself in me
