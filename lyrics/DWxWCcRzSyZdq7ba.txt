Once our lord has come again,
all black hearts will celebrate
the darksome fiend
in the kingdom of sorrow.

Nocturnal fiends,
the beings of the night and shadows
calling forth the pure spirit
of the night.

Our reign may come secretly.
Your Lord's castle is gone.
His glory is no more,
and nothing can stop the purifying.
They remember how you conjured
all those years of sorrow.

Blasting winds of darkness conquer.
Dark lords and their minions coming through.
Hate and sin to remain.
Empty hearts fearing thy name.

Darkness hammers through on the priests.
Darkness hammers forward on the cross.
Servants of God, we will desecrate your coward race
with darkness.

Darkness hammers through on the priests.

Once our lord has come again,
all black hearts will celebrate
the darksome fiend
in the kingdom of sorrow.

When he returns his spirits must choose purity.
When he conquers kingdoms of death
our dead shall all reign again.

Our reign may come secretly.
Your Lord's castle is gone.
His glory is no more,
and nothing can stop the purifying.
They remember how you conjured
all those years of sorrow.

Awakened from the shadows to create.
Riding with me and with all his chosen.
Our lord to be has come again.
Riding from the past.
Little you know your life fades.
