You promise us a bright golden future
you say you will save the world
that there will be no more hunger and pain
but we only see your golden hands
you say you take care of our survival
sending us missiles instead
but you just betray us, deny us and lie
and you always say you would

fight for freedom, fight for rights
i see treason in your eyes.
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand
judas - sittin' in the government
judas - i am not a jesus christ
judas - you will be the one who's crucified

your worship money and economy
there's nothing that you wouldn't do
if the payment is right you don't care about life
'cause economy is your truth
you are the one selling terror and pain
in all the parts of the world
you are preparing the final grand slam
but you keep on tellin' you'll
Fight for freedom, fight for rights
i see treason in your eyes.
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand
judas - sittin' in the government

judas, judas - are you still human?
judas, judas - i can't believe it
judas, judas - dealing with evil
judas, judas
you'll keep on telling you'll
Fight for freedom, fight for rights
i see treason in your eyes.
