Pissed!

Only when the fates commiserate
Do we get a little taste as unique?
The libertine,
Know what I mean?
Hiroshima on a Sunday

You had a gift, you were a gift
But there's always a goddamn catch
Blessing and a curse, you made it work
The universe seems so much smaller

Legend!
Bastard!
Best friend!
Why?
Why do the limits have to realign
Hero!
Martyr!
Mystery!
God - he was the best of us

The world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you

Never be the same, I want the blame
To be assigned to the guiltiest one
It can't be done, because the son
Was the victim they arrested
I'm so fucking pissed at all of this
You gotta know that you are sorely missed
Miracles are real
They help you heal
They make you feel
Like things will get better

Father, brother, scapegoat, why?
Why did we only skip this time?
Fighter, icon, Skeptic
God - stop taking the best of us

I won't let you disappear
I will keep your soul alive if I can't have you here
History may have its share of lunatics and stars
But the world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you
The world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you

Where am I supposed to begin?
I'm killing for the karma again
Feed the meter in the machine
Believing is the way to be seen

Gone - are we alone?
Gone - are we alone?
Gone - are we alone?
Gone - we're not alone

I can't let you disappear
I will keep your soul alive if I can't have you here
We were meant to be the kings
Rule the masses, run the risk
And keep our systems clean
History may have its share of lunatics and stars...
But the world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you
The world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you

The world will never see
(will never see)
Another crazy motherfucker like you
(like you)
Like you
(like you)
Like you
