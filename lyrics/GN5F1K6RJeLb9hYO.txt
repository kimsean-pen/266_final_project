I just can't get my self together
It's the love we make
Every breath we take
I'm a soul in motion

And the show just might go on whatever
It's the latest news
We could never lose
It's a celebration

And we couldn't change our destination
On this road of facination for love

I just can't get my self together
It's the love we make
Every breath we take
I'm a soul in motion

And the show just might go on whatever
It's the latest news
We could never lose
It's a celebration

And we couldn't change our destination
On this road of facination for love

And we couldn't change our destination
On this road of facination for love
