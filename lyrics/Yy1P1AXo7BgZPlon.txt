Uh, uh, 'cause I can't sleep without you
No I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you
Insomnia

I've been down for two days
Tylenol PM ain't working
Losing track of time baby
(Insomnia)
My mind is running too fast
The shadows on the wall keep lurking
I wish that you would come back
(Insomnia)

I keep on hoping to find you
Reaching in between the sheets
Baby, it's only been one night
Feel like it's been like a week
Tossing and turning, tossing and turning
Flipping the pillow, pulling the curtains
(I got, I got, I got)

Insomnia
'Cause I can't sleep without you
No I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you
Insomnia

Insomnia
'Cause I can't sleep without you
No I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you
Insomnia

I can hear your voice now
Keeping me awake 'til morning
Can see you with the lights out
(Insomnia)

I keep on hoping to find you
Reaching in between the sheets
Baby, it's only been one night
Feel like it's been like a week
Tossing and turning, tossing and turning
Flipping the pillow, pulling the curtains
(I got, I got, I got)

Insomnia
'Cause I can't sleep without you
No I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you
Insomnia

Insomnia
'Cause I can't sleep without you
No I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you
Insomnia

I keep on hoping to find you
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying to
You stayed on, you stayed on my mind, you
Oh I got, I got, I got
