Just a drop in the ocean trapped in one thought
Been through the motions, been here before
Picked up the pieces that fell apart
Rebuild and recreated every broken heart

It's easy to lose all that inner faith
When I see the cracks in the home I made
I start to lose my focus, I'm losing ground
I get so high up but always get so down

I've worked too hard
My head and my heart got me this far
I'll wear these scars on my sleeves
Real proud like my broken heart

Cause all I want is another chance
A new beginning
And I just want to make new waves
And find a new way out

Sometimes I am weightless
Just drifting through this life unconscious
A wanderer chasing a dream
Walking the edges of reality, is it just me?

I don't need another bug in my brain to feel transiently okay
I'm off all those prodigal old ways
I found a new start on new waves

I've worked too hard
My head and my heart got me this far
I'll wear these scars on my sleeves
Real proud like my broken heart

Cause all I want is another chance
A new beginning
And I just want to make new waves
And find a new way out

I don't need another bug in my brain
Just wanna feel myself again
I'm off all those prodigal old ways
I made a new start on new waves

Because I worked too hard
You know I've come too far
And I'll wear my scars real proud just like my

Cause all I want is another chance
Just a new beginning
And I just want to make new waves
And find a new way out

All I want is another chance
A new day, a new life, I wanna get out
And I just want to make new waves
And find a new way out
