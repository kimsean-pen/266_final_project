They keep playing sad songs on the radio
And I feel like I'm so alone
On this 15 hour drive
And all awhile I tell my self to just believe
Cause nobody can give so much
And never get anything
(never get anything)

Everyone I use to know
She said I know when ill be calm
But I'm still the same
I know what you say
I still know where I came from

I fell asleep with the lights on
I can see your the first one in a long time.
That had some faith in me
(have faith in me)
I tell my friends, it wont be long
Before it's time for me to come back home
It feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me.

In all the while I say to much of what I think
And I can't remember what it's like to find meaning in anything
For the life of me
Everyone I use to know
She said I know when I'll be calm
But I'm still the same
Not matter what you say
I still know where I came from

And all I ever wanted was so far from what I need
I'll write my songs so sing along I know time heals everything

I fell asleep with the lights on
I can see your the first one in a long time.
That had some faith in me
(have faith in me)
I tell my friends, it wont be long
Before it's time for me to come back home
It feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me.

This is all I have!
This is all I have!
Its my life
This is all I have!
This is all I have!

I fell asleep with the lights on
I can see your the first one in a long time.
That had some faith in me
(have faith in me)
I tell my friends, it wont be long
Before it's time for me to come back home
It feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me.
