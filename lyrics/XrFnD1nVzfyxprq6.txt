Roll off the dice take a spin of the wheel
Out of your hands now so how do you feel?
But you're not gonna win you'd better go back again
Do you feel lucky or do you feel scared?
Take what luck brings and be devil may care
But you're down on your luck what will the next day bring?
Adrift on the ocean, afloat in a day dream
Or lost in a maze or blind in the haze
So what does it matter, so why don't you answer?
So why did you send an angel to mend?
Best make decisions before it's too late
Take all your chances take hold of the reins
A roll of the dice ahead of the game again
Nothin' to lose but so much to gain
A little danger it goes without sayin'
But what do you care you're gonna go in the end
Gate open to heaven is ready and waitin'
Or straight down to hell can go there as well
I'll suffer my cravin' my soul's not worth savin'
So why don't you go? Just leave well alone

Mmm
There's like a hunger that knocks on your door
You've had a taste of it still you want more
You've made your mistakes won't play it the same again
You have been warned but still you plunge in
You play high stakes but there's nothin' to win
You've only one life and so many things to learn
The angel on one side the devil the other
Which path do you take? Decisions to make
Arrive at the crossroads you know where you're goin'
And what if you wait it may be too late
