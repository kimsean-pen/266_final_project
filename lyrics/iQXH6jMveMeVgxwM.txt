If there's a prize for rotten judgement
I guess I've already won that.
No man is worth the aggravation.
That's ancient history, been there, done that.

Who d'you think you're kidding? He's the earth and heaven to you

Try to keep it hidden,
Honey we can see right through you. (oh nooo)
Girl you can't conceal it
We know how you're feeling.
Who you thinking of
No chance no way I won't say it.
No no.

You swoon, you sigh.
Why deny it oh-oh
It's too clich√© I won't say I'm in love.
I thought my heart had learned its lesson.
It feels so good when you start out.

My head is screaming "Get a grip girl!

Unless you're dying to cry your heart out."
Girl you can't deny it
Who you are is how you're feeling
Baby we're not buying
Hon we saw you hit the ceiling.
Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up that you got got got it bad

No chance no way I won't say it.
No no.
Give up, give in.
Check the grin your in love
This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love.
You're way off base I won't say it
(She won't say in love)
Get off my case I won't say it
(Girl don't be proud. It's okay, you're in love)
At least out loud I won't say I'm in love
