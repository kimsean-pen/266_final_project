Started out as a pause, first leather bound and wrapped around the rhythm of my temperature
Rorschach way is back and raw to the marrow, fierce as don't toll me back missy mister official document
My, my, my dot dot dot
My, my, my dot dot ocelot
My, my, my ocelot tongue is sharp and it'll eat you up
Leave you looming wild eyed far cry and wondering in the dark
Best you try to spot dot,
Best you try to spot dot dot,
Best you try to spot dot dot dot,
Best you try to spot dot dot dot dot ocelot.
