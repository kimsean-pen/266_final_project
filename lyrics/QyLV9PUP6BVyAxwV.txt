The face and the lips
Tremble as it rips
Your breath quickening
As heat rushes on

Pull harder strings martyr
Stop you cry, that's a lie
Flush gasping white reddening
You smile and destroy it
It's time that we end this

It's our curse
That makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings

Clawing the skin
Each kill your weakness
Annihilation your masturbation
Tyrant, I'll burn you down

Pull harder strings martyr
Stop you cry, that's a lie
Flush gasping white reddening
You smile and destroy it
It's time that we end this

It's our curse
That makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings
It's our curse
That makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings

My hands grip your throat, I need your end
Burned, staked, ripped apart, I avenge
For every life you've taken
I am here to repay
You ask me "Oh god why?"
'Cause I'm god, that's fucking why
For every life you've taken
I am here to repay

Pull harder strings martyr
Stop you cry, that's a lie
Flush gasping white reddening
You smile and destroy it
It's time that we end this

It's our curse
That makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings
It's our curse
That makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings
