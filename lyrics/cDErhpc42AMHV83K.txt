Got no reason
For coming to me and the rain running down
There's no reason
And the same voice

Coming to me like it's all slowing down
And believe me
I was the one who let you know

I was your sorry-ever-after
74-75
It's not easy
Nothing to say 'cause it's already said

It's never easy
When I look on your eyes
Then I find that I'll do fine

When I look on your eyes
Then I'll do better
I was the one who let you know

I was your sorry-ever-after

74-75
Giving me more and I'll defy
'Cause you're really only after
74-75

Got no reason
For coming to me and the rain running down
There's no reason

When I look on your eyes
Then I find that I'll do fine
When I look on your eyes

Then I'll do better
I was the one who let you know
I was your sorry-ever-after

74-75
Giving me more and I'll defy
'Cause you're really only after
74-75
I was the one who let you know
I was your sorry-ever-after
74-75
Giving me more and I'll defy
'Cause you're really only after
74-75
74-75
