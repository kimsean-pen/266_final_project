A minute,
a second,
a half-life,
a minus,
a segment,
a blinder,
elective detention.
It's secession time,
paid for by cutting backwards.
It's election time,
letting every insult become presidential injury.

(Chorus)
(I'm begging you just hold my head up)
This last disgrace,
breathe in my face,
bleed in distaste,
bless this amen.
final lesson.

A minute,
a second,
a half-life,
a minus,
a second
reminder,
selective attention.
It's secession time,
paid for by cutting backwards.
It's insurrection time,
letting every insult be accepted into history.

(I'm begging you just hold my head up)
This last disgrace,
breathe in my face,
bleed in distaste,
bless this amen.
final lesson.
(Na-Na-Now)

This last disgrace,
bless this amen.

Final lesson.
(Na-Na-Now)

Final lesson.
(Na-Na-Now)

Final lesson.
(Na-Na-Now)

Final lesson.
(Na-Na-Now)

Final lesson.
