Love is all around
Love is all around

Love is all around

Love is all around
Everywhere you look
Love is all around
See it in the eyes of a mother
And her child
See it in the eyes of a friend
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
My heart starts boom
My arms feel weak
My head is exploding
Everyday of the week
I can't eat i can't sleep
'cause your body's so sweet
Put your hand to my heart
Then you feel the beat
Your the wonderful girl
With that sexual healing
When i hold your hand
I get this feeling
You're the only one
Feel so proud
Sweet, sweet girl
Your love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Everywhere you look
Love is all around
See it in the eyes of a mother
And her child
See it in the eyes of a friend
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
I'm dancing, and i feel like flying
Then i see this girl, she is crying
I take her in my arms
It's like a dream
The most beautiful girl in the world i've seen
Look up to me
I see it in your eyes
The moment of truth
No more lies
It's love, love at the first sight
Like heaven on earth, it's shining bright
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Everywhere you look
Love is all around
See it in the eyes of a mother
And her child
See it in the eyes of a friend
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
My heart starts boom
My arms feel weak
My head is exploding
Everyday of the week
I can't eat i can't sleep
'cause your body's so sweet
Put your hand to my heart
Then you feel the beat
Your the wonderful girl
With that sexual healing
When i hold your hand
I get this feeling
You're the only one
Feel so proud
Sweet, sweet girl
Your love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
Everywhere you look
Love is all around
See it in the eyes of a mother
And her child
See it in the eyes of a friend
Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around
