Time revealed what's underneath your skin
You only cared when the floor caved in
You know that I, I'd look for a reason
But it just starts arguments

I'm the candle when your lights burn out
(Ah ah ah ah)
Your assurance in the face of doubt

You pull me like a ripcord, ignored
You're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong and carry on

With what I said I tore into your skin
Mend your wounds while I stitch my lips
It only hurts when the words sink in
It only hurts when the words sink in
Here we are again
Two corners, different ends
Hope it's a season, but it's likely permanent

I'm the candle when your lights burn out
(Ah ah ah ah)
I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down

You pull me like a ripcord, ignored
You're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground right now
The consequences still roll out
Where all our trust is gone
Seem strong and carry on

(I'm the candle when your lights burn out)
(I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down)
(I'm the candle when your lights burn out)
(I'm the shelter when your sky is falling down)

You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't out out
Can't put it out
You wear a mask when I'm around
You lit a fire that my night sweats can't out out
(Can't put it out)
I can't put it out

Now all our trust is gone

You pulled me like a ripcord, secured
You're selfish 'til you need me more
Now all our trust is gone
So if we fall to the ground right now
I'm okay with how things will turn out
You're gone
Seem strong and carry on
