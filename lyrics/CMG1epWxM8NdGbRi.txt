No escape
I navigate
Through my case
Beneath the skin
They keep us in
Night ending

Parasite
Leech upon the guilt from all my wrongs
Leave me on the pathway to the
Paralyse
Staring through the shadows on the wall
Unable to solve this puzzle box

The journey's long
The shadows dance around
The answer lies beyond the fourth wall
My future days
Are etched into my skull
Hanging ever by a tethered
Body, mind and soul

Parasite
Leech upon the guilt from all my wrongs
Leave me on the pathway to the
Paralyse
Staring through the shadows on the wall
Unable to solve this puzzle box

Fruitful deception
Lose your perception
Inside

A fleeting sense of self-worth (self-worth)
That breaks into nothingness (nothingness)
A tepid grip on myself (myself)
Melts away into oblivion (oblivion)

Cells upon the walls can't be unbound
Reflections in the amber to be found
A thought beyond the scream is soon unwound
Truth will now begin to be unbound
Left beyond the mountain left to give
The answer is the line it used to be
But I'll be back to navigate the shores
To lift the veil on what the future holds
Don't lock the sail let it grow
Now I'm waiting for the ebb and flow
Peace to guide the awakening
The lasting consequences of suffering
Cells upon the walls can't be unbound
Reflections in the amber to be found
A thought beyond the scream is soon unwound
Truth will now begin to be unbound

Bouncing off the walls
Latent memories
Pulling at the cord
Earth beneath my feet
Lightning crash the sky
Weakening the beast
Moments in his eyes
Wreak existential fear

Bouncing off the walls

How can truth set us free when lies are all we have
How can time heal us when our days are running out
How can truth set us free when lies are all we have
How can time heal us when our days are running out
