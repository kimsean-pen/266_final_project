I lay myself upon the floor
We're not all dying babe
Well maybe I don't need this after all
It was a place for me

And all the books upon your shelf
Tell stories of who you are
But there's more to the picture son
He says you'll play it on your broken guitar
He says
You play it on your broken guitar

Don't take my word for it
Don't take my word for it
Don't take my word for it
I do
I do
I do

I wake up in the morning so I
Can watch you dress for work
But there's more to the picture here
Than what we seen or what we've heard
What we've seen or what we learn

Don't take my word for it
Don't take my word for it
Don't take my word for it
I do
I do
I do

Don't take my word for it
Don't take my word for it
Don't take my word for it
I do
I do
Don't take my word for it
I do
Don't take my word for it
I do
Don't take my word for it
I do
