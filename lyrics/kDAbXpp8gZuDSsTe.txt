I miss the feeling of the landslide
Shaking the dust off of my skin
What chokes the breath that makes my heart sigh
And now I feel at home again

This God is good enough for me

I'm having trouble with the down time
Can't pick myself off of the floor
Getting so caught up in the meantime
I am so high can't ever come back down

This God is good enough for me

Go on and get up
Go on and get up
Go on and get up
Go on and get up

Oceans of dark now from your blue sky
I found the water is too deep
There is no comfort in the black tide
There is no secret that I can not keep

This God is good enough for me
