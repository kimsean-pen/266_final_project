I'll get lost in the confinement of this vehicle
Ask me the same six people
Speak to the same six people
History follows me and threatens to repeat
And all I crave is regulation
I meet you and fall into the sun
Immediately I want you to tell me everything you're thinking
I feel the earth stop moving
I see this world improving
As I gently detach from my existence, free for you
And If I dive bomb through the thin ice
Thoughts of you will illuminate the afterlife
It's as if my life were split in two
It is before and after I met you
The past was neatly over us like oil
Along with everything I thought I knew
An abstract idea and a universal truth
'Cause you and me, we breathe underwater
Driving away from you
The wind blows us back and forth
I've always hated the bay but
I never had a reason before
History follows me and threatens to repeat
But all I see is my prophecy and need you back from
It's as if my life were split in two
It is before and after I met you
The past was neatly over us like oil
Along with everything I thought I knew
An abstract idea and a universal truth
'Cause you and me, we breathe underwater
