Can we sing Hallelujah?
Oh if I let you down
Were just two hearts
That one day will go their own way
Oh as I see it now
Were like two stones trying to float on water
Can we sing Hallelujah one more time?
One more time
Can we sing Hallelujah one more time?
I only need what I need ooo
It only takes me from me ooo
So wont you let me fall
Why wont you let this
Take me down
Let it take another bow now
You know that I cant stay sober yet
Oh if I let you down
Were just two hearts
That one day will go their own way
Oh as I see it now
Were like two stones trying to float on water
In your mind, in your mind its over
Cause you know that I cant stay sober yet
In your mind, in your mind its over
This is about as happy as I get
Can we sing Hallelujah one more time?
One more time
Can we sing Hallelujah one more time?
I only need what I need ooo
It only takes me from me ooo
So wont you let me fall
Why wont you let this
Take me down
Let it take another bow now
You know that I cant stay sober yet
One more, one more, one more, one more time
One more, one more, one more, one more time
One more, one more, one more, one more time
Can we sing Hallelujah one more time?
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
It only takes me from me
So wont you let me fall
Why wont you let this
Take me down
Let it take another bow now
You know that I cant stay sober yet
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
