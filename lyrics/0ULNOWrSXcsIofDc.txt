There is a girl in her world she is found
Yeah she will say she's okay, but she's down
Her hair is a mess its the best in sunshine
Her eyes are so bright, but at night they are mine

And baby much too great, to appreciate
And baby much too great, to appreciate

And I've been breaking all the rules
breaking all the rules
been breaking them for you
And I've been breaking all the rules
breaking all the rules
been breaking them for you

And now the girl starts to turn and I'm gone
All of the words that you've heard now sound down
I kill all the smiles the long while I'm alone
I'll pay the dues while I watch you set in stone

And babe is it a crime, do take all your time

And I've been breaking all the rules
breaking all the rules
been breaking them for you
And I've been breaking all the rules
breaking all the rules
been breaking them for you
