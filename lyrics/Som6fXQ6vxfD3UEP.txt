At nightime I go out and see the people
Air goes cool and hurrying on my way
And dressing so sweet, all the people to see
They're looking at me, all the people to see.

And when I set my eyes on you
You look like a kitty
And when you're in the moon
Oh you look so pretty

Caught a glance in your eyes
And fell through the skies
Glance in your eyes
And fell through the skies

I'm walking down the freezing street
Scarf goes out behind
You said, "Get them away"
Please don't say a word

"Get me out of here
Get me out of here
I hate it here
Get me out of here"

At nightime I go out and see the people
Air goes cool and hurrying on my way
Glanced in your eyes and fell through the skies
Dance in your eyes and fell through the skies
