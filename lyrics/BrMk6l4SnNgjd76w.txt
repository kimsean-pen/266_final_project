Ooh, ooh-ooh, what?
Ooh, ooh-ooh, that's dope
Ooh, ooh-ooh, what?
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Love you like I never loved anyone
Keep me burning hot like a red return
Want you like I never wanted anyone
You give it to me fast like free and fun

Everytime with you
Feels like I'm in summer
I don't know why
Maybe 'cause you're so cool
And keep it down on the real
Like sugar, sugar, fly

Oh, you're sweet, a sugar cane
Make me feel alive again

I'm going down, down
Take you down to paradise
(Rock you like a real bad baby)
La, love, lick you like vanilla ice
(Lick you up and make you crazy)

Shot, hot, give me what you got
You can buy my hot supersonic pop
Goin' down, down
Take you down to paradise

Want you like I never wanted anyone
Got a face like God and a bod' like Tron
Kiss you like I never kissed anyone
Cause you keep it really rough like, oh my God

Every time with you I can tell it's forever
I don't know how
And even if it's not, you know I couldn't stop
You make my heart go pow

Coming down like pouring rain
Make me feel alive again

I'm going down, down
Take you down to paradise
(Rock you like a real bad baby)
La, love, lick you like vanilla ice
(Lick you up and make you crazy)

Shot, hot, give me what you got
You can buy my hot supersonic pop
Down, down, take you down to paradise
(How do you like that, baby?)

Down down, take you down to paradise

Ooh, ooh, dope!
Ooh, ooh, that's sick!
Ooh, ooh, dope!
Ooh, ooh, that's sick!

I'm going down, down
Take you down to paradise
(Rock you like a real bad baby)
La, love, lick you like vanilla ice
(Lick you up and make you crazy)

Shot, hot, give me what you got
You can buy my hot supersonic pop
Goin' down, down
Take you down to paradise
