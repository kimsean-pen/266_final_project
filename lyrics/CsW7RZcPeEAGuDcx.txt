He taps at my window
Willing that I let him in
I don't think I will though
My heart's taken, I won't tell him again

Maybe I'll write him a story and
Maybe I'll fall asleep in his arms
Maybe I'll wake up lonely
And fall unawake again

And until you calm me down, race around this town
Trying to find, oh, an emotion you cannot deny
And I will not have him treat me this way

And mother, I blame you
Therein trying to be you again
For I have become you
And I know every part of the game

And father, I love you
But how can you watch as I push her away?
I cannot forgive you for bringing me up this way

Maybe I'll write them a story
And maybe I'll fall asleep in his arms
Maybe I'll wake up lonely
And fall unawake again

And until you calm me down, I race around this town
Until you calm me down, I race around this town
Trying to find, oh, an emotion you cannot deny
And I will not have them treat me this way

So tap at my window
Maybe I might let you in
I don't think I will though
My heart's taken, I won't tell you again
