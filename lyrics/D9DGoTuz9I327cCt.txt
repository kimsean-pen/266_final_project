I told you I had to leave
I had my reasons
I said that it hurt to stay, honey
The way that I'm feeling

It's not love
That left you standing
It's not love
That left you cold

It's not love
Misunderstanding
Only a mistake
There's nothing left to take

Why, baby, why did you make me let you go?
Leave you so lonely
Why, baby, why did you have to hold on?
You know it's not love anymore

I gave you your last chance
But you didn't believe me
You can't keep me satisfied
The way that you treat me

It's not love
That left you standing
It's not love
That left you cold

It's not love
Misunderstanding
Only a mistake
There's nothing left to take

Why, baby, why did you make me let you go?
Leave you so lonely
Why, baby, why? Stop playing with my heart
I told you

It's not love
Telling you to be this way
It's not love
Saying you can never change

It's not love
When I told you? Is he putting you down?
Down, down, down
It's not love
That left you standing
It's not love
That left you cold

It's not love
Misunderstanding
Only a mistake
There's nothing left to take

It's not love, why, baby, why?
It's not love, why, baby, why?
It's not love, why, baby, why?
It's not love, why, baby, why?
It's not love
