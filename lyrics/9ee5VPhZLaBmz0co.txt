I've got a cupboard with cans of food
filtered water and pictures of you
and i'm not coming out until this is all over
and i'm looking through the glass
where the light bends at the cracks
and i'm screaming at the top of my lungs
pretending the echoes belong to someone
someone i used to know
and we become
silhouettes when our bodies finally go
I wanted to walk through the empty streets
and feel something constant under my feet
but all the news reports
recommended I stay indoors
because the air outside will make
our cells divide at an alarming rate
until our shells simply can not hold
all our insides in and thats when we'll explode
and it won't be a pretty sight
and we'll become
silhouettes when our bodies finally go
and we'll become
(and we'll become)
(and we'll become)
silhouettes when our bodies finally go
and we'll become
(and we'll become)
(and we'll become)
silhouettes when our bodies finally go
and we'll become
(and we'll become)
(and we'll become)
silhouettes when our bodies finally gooo
(and we'll become)
(and we'll become)
(and we'll become)
