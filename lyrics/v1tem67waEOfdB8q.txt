I came home to the flashing lights
To find the whispers won you over again
You've spent weeks as a tourist inside of your head
It's so hard to be happy, so hard to pretend

If I called right now
Could we talk about the misery in you?
I should call right now
'Cause I promise
I'll dedicate the time now
To putting out the fire in your eyes
Commiserate and wind down
I can't erase all I've left behind
I'll dedicate

It's been days since I've seen your smile
You said the chemicals just fuck with your mind
I wish I could be the one to set you free
It's so hard to find balance, so hard to find peace

If I called right now
Could we talk about the misery in you?
I should call right now
'Cause I promise
I'll dedicate the time now
To putting out the fire in your eyes
Commiserate and wind down
I can't erase all I've left behind
I'll dedicate

Could we talk about the misery in you?
I'll promise I'll dedicate the time

I'll dedicate the time now
To putting out the fire in your eyes
Commiserate and wind down
I can't erase all I've left behind
I'll dedicate

I'll dedicate the time now
To putting out the fire in your eyes
