Ok, wake up in the morning to the clear blue sky
Turn up the music when I hop in the ride
The windows down let the whole world see
Can't nobody rock it like the little old me

I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
I got my chucks and my dickies and I put it on black
Banging Sinatra in the black cadillac

My old lady leaning out the whole window
Everybody lookin' when we walk in slow

I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up

woowo wooo
woowo woo (everybody singing now)
woowo wooo
woowo woo (everybody singing now)

woowo wooo (everybody singing now)
woowo woo (everybody singing now)

Ok, 1 for the money and a 2 for the show
But 3 to be a legend even if I'm poor

I ain't chasin' nothin' you gon' have to catch me
And if you wanna taste you gon' have to pay a fee

I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
Call my mama, in-laws and my little scarecrows?
When they hear my record well they all hit the floor

Babies rock a pose c'mon fill the front row
The homies in the back tip their hats real low

I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
woowo wooo
woowo woo (everybody singing now)

wowo wooo (everybody singing now)
woowo woo (everybody singing now)

Ok, come on everybody won't you clap your hands
White folks do it on time if you can
Sounds good, now here's the plan
Let's all sing together like we're in the same band

I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up

Now, we're gonna reach another whole new level
Grabbin' the light on the run from the devil (watch out)
Been downtown for too long
I feel the sun risin' all up in my bones

I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
