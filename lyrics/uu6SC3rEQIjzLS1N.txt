I won't see til you come back
I won't sing til you know that
And it won't be long
til you know my songs

Then I'll know, and you'll come back

I won't move til you love me
I won't dance til you hold me
And it won't be long
til you know my songs

Then you'll know, and you'll come back

And I won't see a light til you come back to me
And I won't feel a breeze til I hear your housekey
And I won't hear a sound til you fall to my knees,
sayin' "please, don't leave me"

I won't breathe til you're with me,
And my heart won't beat, Lord forbid me
And it won't be long
til you hear this song

And you'll turn to me

And I won't see a light til you come back to me
And I won't feel a breeze til I hear your housekey
And I won't hear a sound til you fall to my knees,
sayin' "please, don't leave me"
sayin' "please, don't leave me"

And I'll leave you, Marie
With your bags at your feet
And your frame dropped to your knees

I think we'll be even then, don't you agree?
I think we'll be even then, don't you agree?
Yeah, I think we'll be even then,
don't you agree?
