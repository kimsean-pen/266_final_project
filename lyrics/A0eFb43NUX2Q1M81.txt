Shine through me Satan
Yes, live now through this tool of yours
Live through me, O seditious star,
and like a thousand suns shall I spread thy light

Like a thousand plagues
A thousand wars

I bind for thee the hope of man
Bound on earth, bound in heaven

Burn in me, angel
Yes, burn the self to kill the human within
And fetter now these lustful limbs
Fetter the flesh, choke the sin

Laudamus te
Adoramus te

I condemn all in me that is not of thee
And now I am the light that is above all

Holy poison, holy doom
Reborn for injection in the veins of man
A mirror of fear to turn life against life
Now set me free in the plan of God

Original serpent, hear me... see me... Enslave and use me
I breathe only to take the form thou wish

Quoniam tu solus sanctus
Tu solus dominus

And like a child frightened to obedience shall I do thy holy will until eternity ends and thereafter... Amen

Shine through me Satan
Yes, breathe now through this tool of yours
Dwell through me, O seditious star,
and like a thousand suns shall I spread thy light

Like a thousand plagues
A thousand wars
A thousand hells and a thousand storms

Glorificamus te
Oremus

Let us give praise
Extol and worship

Gratias agimus tibi propter magnam gloriam tuam

Holy poison, holy doom
Reborn for infection in the womb of wombs
A spiral of Chaos, God against God
Now set me free in the plan of life
The plan of God, holy doom
A legion of spasms in the limbs of the bearer
God against life against God against all
Holy poison, holy doom...
