Could you be the angel left in the dark?
It's mostly silence echoing
Through the halls
Kill the hunt instead of lying to myself
For long I've seen the signs
Written on these walls
Written on these walls

I will search, search through
The wreckage of my soul
Believe in what I have 'cause that's
That's all I am
That's all I am

I swear I could hear
Voices from the edge of the earth
Reminding myself to breathe slow
Wandering alone in this wasteland
We used to call home

Could you be the devil left in my heart?
All these feelings I wish I could turn them off
Kill the hunt instead of lying to myself
For long I've seen the signs
Written on these walls
Written on these walls

I swear I could hear
Voices from the edge of the earth
Reminding myself to breathe slow
Wandering alone in this wasteland
We used to call home

I will search, search through
The wreckage of my soul
Believe in what I have 'cause that's
That's all I am

I swear I could hear
Voices from the edge of the earth
Reminding myself to breathe slow
Wandering alone in this wasteland
We used to call home
We used to call home
I swear I could hear
Voices from the edge of the earth
