Ever loved a woman
Who made you feel tall?
Ever loved a man
Who made you feel small?

If you were a sailor
I'd raise the anchor
To sail the sea
In search of you and me

And god conjures currents
To break our fragile boats
And both the innocent and the damned
Are swallowed up in his wake

If you were a huntress
I'd be your bow
For your silver arrows
To seek out his heart

Ever loved a woman
Who made you feel tall?
Ever loved a man
Who made you feel small?

Who are you to complain
For lack of understanding?
We are all created equal
In just one thing alone

Alone in your thoughts
That consume you through your life
They'll take you outwards
To the dark edge of time

And there's nothing more dangerous
Than a man with nothing to lose
Nothing to live for
And nothing to prove
