Stay away from me
Build a fortress and shield your beliefs
Touch the divine
As we fall

In line
Can I believe
When I don't trust?
All your theories turn to dust
I choose to hide
From the all seeing eye

Destroy this
City of delusion
Break
These

Walls
Down
I will avenge!
And justify my reasons
With your blood
You will not rest

Settle for less
Until you guzzle and squander what's left
Do not deny
That you live

And let die
Destroy this
City of delusion
Break
These
Walls
Down
I will avenge!
And justify my reasons
With your blood
Destroy this
City of delusion
Break
These
Walls
Down
I will avenge!
And justify my reasons
With your blood
