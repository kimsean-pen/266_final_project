You only saw
The dark side of me
Bring me back

To my reality
I have lost my belief
Without you I fail
In every way

Picture a world for me
Where I can stay
Without you I break

In every way
Imagine a place for us
Where you and I stay
I have lost

The will to fly
With broken wings
I can't even try
I have lost my belief

Without you I fail
In every way
Picture a world for me
Where I can stay
Without you I break
In every way
Imagine a place for us
Where you and I stay
Picture a world for us
A promise to set me free
Imagine a place for us
A promise will set me free
(Picture a world for us
A promise to set me free)
(A promise)
Without you I fail
In every way
Picture a world for me
Where I can stay
Without you I break
In every way
Imagine a place for us
Where you and I stay
