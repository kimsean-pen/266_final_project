the moves are questionable
stay, it does distill in the pouth
you keep on askin' for help
but nobody knows how
you got your socks pulled up high
but your pants are down low
with your eye far apart
i've struck down the nose
the tiger tied to your back
keeps on kissin' your nose
and keeps feedin' you wine
saying "never let go..."

and still i want you to,
sway how you wanna sway
make it what you want
i'll be on decay
it's so manageable
oh we're so manageable

stuck on some musty cruise
tryin' to stay high, i'll be up on fumes
it's so manageable
we're capt. ethereal

the rooster's singin' his song
as the clocks turn to 12
and did the child get home?
and did he finally go spare?
i'm feelin' more like a fool
than maybe ever before
and i don't feel dice
trying to tell the score

and still i want you to,
sway how you wanna sway
make it what you want
i'll be on decay
it's so manageable
oh we're so manageable

stuck on some musty cruise
tryin' to stay high, i'll be up on fumes
it's so manageable
we're capt. ethereal

and there's no reason to
hold your hands up, sigh and move away
it's a happy go now
it's a happy load now
still beyond this, motion silence has a kid
it's alive, oh now
the intangible

< instrumental >

and still i want you to,
sway how you wanna sway
make it what you want
i'll be on decay
it's so manageable
oh we're so manageable

stuck on some musty cruise
tryin' to stay high, i'll be up on fumes
it's so manageable
we're capt. ethereal
aaah... aoo...
