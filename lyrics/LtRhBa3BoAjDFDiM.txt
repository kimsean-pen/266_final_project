In between the ring notes where the stars are hiding
In the way, till another moon wakes
There is something there

And the money games from
Every word in silence
In crushed glass by the train line
There is something there

Something is there

In between the islands where we used to swim
To a place, I am on my way
I am on my way

I swim to addition
I can circle my thoughts
Fake feelings

I swim
I swim
