I know a man who was afraid to love
To lay his heart on the bathroom rug
Drank his coffee in the same old mug
He sat in silence 'till the world felt numb

Until the day when a girl came by
She had eyes like the rising tide
Filled the sharpness deep inside
The kind of thing that can't be satisfied

We hate the rain when it fills up our shoes
But how we love when it washes our cars

We love to love when it fills up the room
But when it leaves we're cursing the stars

So he turned to the radio
And he went to a picture show
He tried to find someone else who knows
All the hurt that a heart can hold

She smelled like cinnamon and winter clove
And sparked like fire would inside a stove
He went to ask her just to sit and stay
Instead he watched as she walked away

We hate the rain when it fills up our shoes
But how we love when it washes our cars

We love to love when it fills up the room
But when it leaves we're cursing the stars

We hate the rain when it fills up our shoes
But how we love when it washes our cars

We love to love when it fills up the room
But when it leaves we're cursing the stars
