I don't know where to start
Say I'm tired or throw a party
These cucumber eyes
Are lying the more that I smile
Oh about it
And all of my clothes
Feel like somebody's old throwaways
I don't like it

It really does suit you
Just like everything
I'm happy you're in love
'Cause every colour
Goes where you do

I'm adoring you, it's all good
You're so beautiful
I'm black and blue all over
You're breaking my flow
How could you know what I'm saying?
Oh, about it
When all of my clothes
Feel like somebody's old throwaways
I don't like it

It really does suit you
Just like everything
I'm happy you're in love
'Cause every colour
Goes where you do

I feel so powerless
I've, I've got to stop it somehow
Oh come on, what can I do?
Whys it happening? (Oh)
How's it happening without me?
Whys it happening? (Oh)
How's it happening that he feels it without me?

It really does suit you
Just like everything
I'm happy you're in love
'Cause every colour
Goes where you do

'Cause every colour
Goes where you do
Goes where you do
I'm happy you're in love (hey)
Happy you're in love (hey)
I'm happy you're in love, oooh (hey)
I'm happy you're in love
(hey, hey, hey)
