Warden's calling for a lockdown, baby
He'll call on interim inequities
This is the last night in my body;
Assist in the escape
Warden's calling on a jailbreak, baby
He'll fly like only a jailbird could
He'll fly like only a jailbird could

Like a felon, he fell into scandals,
Scams, and master plans
To circumvent all circumstances
He thought to his throat,
"We can swallow this key and leave when we please"
Let's hope this stomach, stomach
Let's hope this stomach disagrees

Warden's calling for a lockdown, baby
He'll call on interim inequities
This is the last night in my body;
Assist in the escape
Warden's calling on a jailbreak, baby
He'll fly like only a jailbird could
He'll fly like only a jailbird could

"Make a clean getaway," he said,
With his hands outstretched
To nurse her neck
She lured him in with a masochistic kiss
And he wished he could be anywhere, be anywhere but here

Warden's calling for a lockdown, baby
He'll call on interim inequities
This is the last night in my body;
Assist in the escape
Warden's calling on a jailbreak, baby
He'll fly like only a jailbird could
He'll fly like only a jailbird could

Arm (he could be anywhere)
in arm we walk (but here, but here)
outside (he could be anywhere)
so that all we've done was not in vain. (but here, but here)

Warden's calling for a lockdown, baby
He'll call on interim inequities
This is the last night in my body;
So assist in the escape
Warden's calling on a jailbreak, baby
He'll fly like only a jailbird could
He'll fly like only a jailbird could

Warden's calling for a lockdown, baby (Somehow,)
He'll call on interim inequities (for now,)
This is the last night in my body; (this skin will have to do.)
So assist in the escape
Warden's calling on a jailbreak, baby (Somehow,)
He'll fly like only a jailbird could (for now,)
He'll fly like only a jailbird could (this skin will have to do.)

This is the last night in my body, yeah.
