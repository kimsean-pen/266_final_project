Lay your head on my pillow
Here you can be yourself
No one has to know what you are feeling
No one but me and you

I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

I feel such a connection
Even when you're far away
Oooo baby if there's anything that you fear
Call 4894608 and I'll be here

I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

And only we know what we talked about baby boy
Don't know how you can be drivin' me so crazy, boy
Baby, when you're in town why don't you come around, boy?
I'll be the loyalty you need you can trust me boy
(ohh)

I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary
