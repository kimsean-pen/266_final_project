I couldn't say it to your face
But I won't be around any more
I couldn't say it to your face
But I won't be around any more
I needed a place
So I walked in the door
I couldn't say it to your face
But I won't be around any more

It's my world
It's my song
Didn't ask you to sing along
In my arms
You girl, you won't be here to say I'm wrong

I couldn't say it to your face
But I won't be around any more
I couldn't say it to your face
But I won't be around any more
I needed some space
So I walked out the door
I couldn't say it to your face
But I won't be around any more

I heard
Them say maybe some day I'd have to pay
I don't say
One word to let you know I'm going away

I couldn't say it to your face
But I won't be around any more
I couldn't say it to your face
But I won't be around any more
I needed a place, so
I walked in the door
I couldn't say it to your face
But I won't be around any more
