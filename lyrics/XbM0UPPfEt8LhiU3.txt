Without light
The dark encloses all
Our works would be but ash
No knowledge of the time that crushes love to dust
Or the life that's frozen deep within our veins

Without dark
The light burns out our eyes
And turns each of us to ash
Our hearts, too hard to ever learn to feel
And mouths, laid open, deep in silent song

Trapped within
That which all collapses
For fear of what may lay beyond
When peace eludes
And devastation happens
A subtle glimpse of where we each belong

Darkened heart
Enlightened mind
Whole world apart
Remain entwined

I'm reaching out
Across frayed tapestry of lives
Eroding worlds
Cut through unravelled cords of time
Within this rift
Where lays our heart of hearts defined
My darkness and your light, still yet remain entwined
