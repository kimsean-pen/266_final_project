I wish I could eat the salt
Off of your lost faded lips
We can cap the old times
Make playing only logical harm
We can cap the old lines
Make playing that nothing else will change

But she can read, she can read, she can read
She can read she's bad
She can read, she can read
She can read she's bad
Oh, she's bad

But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never see this face again
You go stabbing yourself in the neck

And we could find new ways of living
Make playing only logical harm
And we could top the old times
Clay-making that nothing else will change

But she can read, she can read, she can read
She can read she's bad
She can read, she can read
She can read she's bad
Oh, she's bad

It's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never see this place again
You go stabbing yourself in the neck
But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never see this place again
And you'll go stabbing yourself in the neck

It's in the way that she poses
It's in the things that she puts in my hair
Her stories are boring and stuff
She's always calling my bluff
She puts it, she puts the weights into my little heart
And she gets in my room and she takes it apart
She puts the weights into my little heart
I said she puts the weights into my little heart
She packs it away
It's in the way that she walks
Her heaven is never enough
She puts the weights in my heart
She puts it, she puts the weights into my little heart
