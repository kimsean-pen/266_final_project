Old cold stars
In prison bars
Learner, burners
Daylight returners

They won't play
No love inside
Dynamite girls
Switch on the radar

Eight ones for the machine
That's what she needs
That's what she feeds

Good fortune if you can
Hey hey the rally boys

Good fortune and luck
You won't catch the rally boys

Good fortune if you can
Hey hey the rally boys

Good fortune and luck
You won't catch the rally boys
The cyclone alley boys
The Rand McNally boys
