And I stood upon the sand of the sea
And saw a beast rise up out of the sea
Having seven heads and ten horns
And upon his horns ten crowns
And upon his heads the name of blasphemy

Trumpets cry warnings from Heaven
The Virgin dressed with the Sun
With the Moon on her feet
On her head, a garland of twelve stars
Being with child, she cries
For the birth of a king

War horns, the sign of the times
Break through the silent cries

Petrified, I'm facing the rapture
Choking on tears, the prophecy fulfills
The angels arise announcing the gathering
The wages of sin are for all who live to see

War horns, the sign of the times
Break through the silent cries
Visions from prophets unveiled
All burns in the lake of fire

Fire will be raining from the sky
The Sun will be darkened
The Moon will not give its light
The stars will fall
And the powers of Heaven are shaken
That's when the Son of Man
Will arise in the clouds
Go!

War horns, the sign of the times
Break through our silent cries
Visions of prophets unveiled
All burns in the lake of fire
