Hallelujah
The iron king sings a song for the lover
The leaver, the lonely, and like
Young love waits
If I can then I'll meet you at the gate of St. Peter
When the fever takes my mind
My god she came singing my name
Sounded like rain on the mountain
While I burned alive
Young flame burns soft as a candle
Lit between our two hearts
Just beats apart in the dark

Spent my summer out and high (high)
On the whiplash
Head back blowin' through the leaves
Growin' up a preacher was all you ever dreamed

I got the holy rope
I got the holy rope
I felt the fever grip
When I needed it closer
I'm at the fever pitch
Not quite but nearin' it
Can't feed the fever yet
I'm savin' up my daily measurement

I'm at the grocery store
I'm buying eggs and toast
Lookin' at you and not where I walk
I broke my nose just facin' god
Don't let the fever get you
Got god already
Lost my soul in the seventh heaven
Makin' out on aisle eleven

Spent my summer out and high (high)
On the whiplash
Head back blowin' through the leaves
Growing up a preacher was always just a dream
All you ever needed were lines you could believe
Sang them to me sweetly
Only just a dream

Well I know you can't walk
With them heels in the dark
Kick 'em off
Let's talk
Let me get to know you
Well I don't know nothin'
But I'm quick pickin' up and
I think I could get you in a minute or two
Yeah if I could get a minute
Four, five at the limit
I think I might make you
Smile after dinner
Kick me under the table
I think that's my in
And I think I came for that
What comes with it?

Let it simmer
Let it simmer
Simmer down please

I got the holy rope
I got the holy rope
I felt the fever grip me
When I needed it most (thank the lord)
I'm at the fever pitch now
I'm at the fever pitch
Not quite but nearly there
I mean it man
