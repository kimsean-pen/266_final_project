Scream

A chill runs up your spine
Crawling to your brain,
The freezing touch of fear
It's driving me insane
Although you try to fight
Dragged from the silence where you hide

Till you scream
Till you scream

A chill runs up your spine
Crawling to your brain,
The freezing touch of fear
It's driving me insane
Although you try to fight
Dragged from the silence where you hide

Till you scream
Till you scream

Scream
I can't wait to wait to hear you scream
It's driving me insane
Although you try to fight

Dragged up silence where you hide.

Till you scream

Scream
I can't wait to hear you
I can't wait to hear you
Scream
I can't wait to hear you
I can't wait to hear you
Scream
Scream
Scream
