Smoke across the night sky
Tears the black open
Glows toward the earthbound
Breaks the light down

This moon, this night
This sign that symbolizes
To me, what must be done

Shadows that mirror
And nurture the spirit

My world - crumbled
Your world - a star
Our world - it rumbles tonight

No mask, pure will
One hand, one blade
Shadows sink

Summon the unwanted
And gather for a (final) journey

My world - crumbled
Your world - a star
Our world - it rumbles tonight
