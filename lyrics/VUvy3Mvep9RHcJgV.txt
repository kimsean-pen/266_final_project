You're wasting your time
She says only the lonely
Born in my life
Saw me lost in the moment

And down on my knees
As I beg and I plea
For some time in your sheets
So I get what I need, oh yeah

Straight struck by her figure plot
Worsen shower curtain
As she pulls bernards trigger
And I hope and I pray
That it's going to fit her
But with Marlboro lips
How the fuck am I gonna quit her? Oh yeah

But late in the night
I'm wondering like
Who are you, are you, baby?
The thorn in my side, or just my type?

I know it's wrong
But I still want this bad love too much
Your touch, my lonely heart can't get enough, no

She, she sit there making fun of my tendency
To fumble buttons
Frequency of quickly coming
To make me feel like I'm yours, oh

And me, I push my friends against the fence
She on the hunt for finger prints
Or circumstantial evidence
The things I'll do just to score

Late in the night
I'm wondering like
Who are you, are you, baby?
The thorn in my side, or just my type?
Oh, hoo

I know it's wrong
But I still want this bad love too much
Your touch, my lonely heart can't get enough
Speaking sweet sins, wet wick
Calling my bluffs like text and sex
I feel the same homicidal thoughts and growing pains
