I been all on my own, so I ain't gone out much
I been smokin' a lot, I ain't been eatin' enough
I been off of my game, feel like I'm losin' my touch
I been runnin' out of people I trust
I be by myself, thats how im commin' now
Never asked for help, so why you buggin' now
I will never fail, but I been stressin' out
Cause I ain't found myself, but I been lookin' for him
Walk with me through the valley below
It's a cold world you should cover up for the snow
And there's snakes in the grass so you cut that shit low
And the cops try to kill you so just stay on your toes
I'm a sick piece of shit, that much I admit
My momma say she love me but they call me a prick
And your girlfriend she don't love you cause she all on my dick
She came here with you, she goin' home with my clique
I be by myself, thats how im commin' now
Never asked for help, so why you buggin' now
I will never fail, but I been stressin' out
Cause I ain't found myself, but I been lookin' for him
Walk with me through the valley below
It's a cold world you should cover up for the snow
And there's snakes in the grass so you cut that shit low
And the cops try to kill you so just stay on your toes
I'm a sick piece of shit, that much I admit
My momma say she love me but they call me a prick
And your girlfriend she don't love you cause she all on my dick
She came here with you, she goin' home with my clique
