My baby's on the level
I try to read her mind
She's on the straight and narrow
I'm guessing all the time

But I can't see the road if I'm looking at the signs
I'm carrying a load and stepping out of line

My baby's on the level
I try to read her mind
She's on the straight and narrow
I'm guessing all the time
Oh, well, how can I see the road if I'm looking at the signs
I'm carrying a load, and stepping out of line
