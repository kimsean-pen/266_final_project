Help, It's gone black, the sky is black
Earth is frozen and black
The moon is black, snow is black
Her eyes, when open, are black
Light is black, leads are black
The wires that run from them are black
Stars are black, time is black
But the thought of death is soft and clean and beautiful and white
It's the purest of the drugs
'Cause it's everything at once

What if meaning never comes?
And I was just someone to fuck?
All of life, beginners luck?
What becomes of all creation if the smallest prayer is firmly answered, "No"?
The greatest of the floods
There's a vacuum where the brightest future was

I'd better warm up my gun
In case love is not enough
I'd better warm up my gun
In case love is not enough

What haven't I done? What have I done?
What haven't I done? What have I done?
What haven't I done to deserve a cold war on all sides?
It's so bleak all the time
"Stay with me, you're alone in the center of hell, just be"
The longest winter I have ever seen
From hospital to hospital, repeat

First I need to save the life of God
So that God can come and save me from myself
If I have to walk alone I'm giving up
I can't stay here knowing love is not enough
If I have to walk alone I'm giving up
I can't stay here knowing love is not enough

Untimely, ripped into this world
I was born again as a girl
Untimely, ripped into this world
I was born again as a girl
Untimely, ripped into this world
I was born again as a girl
Untimely, ripped into this world
I was born again as a girl
