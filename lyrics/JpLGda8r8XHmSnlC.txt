I've been defeated and brought down
(Oh-oh-oh)
Dropped to my knees when hope ran out
(Oh-oh-oh!)
The time has come to change my ways

On this day I see clearly, everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind
(Ye-eah)

I'll never long for what might have been
(No-o-o)
Regret won't waste my life again
(Oh-oh-oh!)
I won't look back
I'll fight to remain

On this day I see clearly, everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all behind
On this day it's so real to me
Everything has come to life
Another chance to chase a dream
Another chance to feel
Chance to feel alive
(Ooooh)

Fear will kill me, all I could be
Lift these sorrows
Let me breathe
Could you set me free?
Could you set me free?

On this day I see clearly, everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all behind
On this day it's so real to me
Everything has come to life
Another chance to chase a dream
Another chance to feel
Chance to feel alive!
