She's up against them all
But the writings on the wall
There's more than meets the eye with her

There's nothing I can do
I'm left without a clue
She sees it all in black and white or blue

She's got a rebel heart
One day she's gonna fall
She's got a rebel heart
She's up against them all

No she never will admit
That what she wants she'll never get
She never knew just when to quit

A star lit up the sky
Her heart is where her fire lies
Could see it in her painted eyes

She's got a rebel heart
One day she's gonna fall
She's got a rebel heart
She's up against them all

She don't seem to understand
What she wants to do
Light a fire, hit and run
Like good rebels do

She's got a rebel heart
One day she's gonna fall
She's got a rebel heart
She's up against them all

She's gonna overthrow our love
Maybe too much ain't enough
And we won't make it out alive

She's got a rebel heart
She's had it from the start
She's out there on the run again

She's got a rebel heart
One day she's gonna fall
She's got a rebel heart
She's up against them all
