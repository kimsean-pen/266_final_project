Jump
I don't wanna wake up today
Cause everyday's the same
And I've been waiting so long
For things to change
I'm sick of this town
Sick of my job
Sick of my friends
Cause everyone's jaded
Sick of this place
I wanna break free
I'm so frustrated

I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Don't wanna think about tomorrow (Jump!)
I just don't care tonight
I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Don't wanna think about my sorrow
Let's go, whoa
Forget your problems
I just wanna jump

I don't wanna wake up one day
And find out it's too late
To do all the things I wanna do
So I'm gonna pack up my bags
I'm never coming back
Cause the years are passing by
And I've wasted all my t-t-time

I'm sick of this house
Sick of being broke
Sick of this town thats bringing me down
I'm sick of this place
I wanna break free
I'm so frustrated

I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Don't wanna think about tomorrow (Jump!)
I just don't care tonight
I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Dont wanna think my sorrow
Let's go, whoa
Forget your problems I just wanna jump
I just wanna jump

I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore

Forget tomorrow
I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Don't wanna think about tomorrow (Jump!)
I just don't care tonight
I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Don't wanna think my sorrow
Let's go, whoa
Forget your problems
Time to let them go
Whoa
Forget tomorrow
I just wanna jump (Jump!)
I just wanna jump (Jump!)
Yeah!
I just wanna jump (Jump!)
I just wanna jump
