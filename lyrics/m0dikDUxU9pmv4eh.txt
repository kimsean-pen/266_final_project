Pretty if the sun won't shine
I'll be coming out to meet you
I'll be there to make you mine

You're pretty if the rain will pour
I'll be knocking at your window
I'll be begging you for more

It is as if you've come along too soon
and I'm trying to fit you in
but I can't seem to follow

You're a cutie if it all falls through
We can piece it back together
I can learn to trust you too

You're just too good to lose
and I can't refuse
so don't make me choose
between the two
I'm fed up in here
in my atmosphere
Don't you know who you are
You're my shooting star

Your pretty teach me wrong from right
'cause in love there are no answers
and in life there is no lie
You're pretty if the sun won't shine
Now you've come this far to meet me
and I know, I know you're mine

You're just too good to lose
and I can't refuse
so don't make me choose
between the two
I'm fed up in here
in my atmosphere
Don't you know who you are
You're my shooting star

Don't you know who you are
You're my shooting star
