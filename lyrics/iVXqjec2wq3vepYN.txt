Answers come in dreams
That I pray and pray
I let my being rest
In hope to know each day

Will my answers come in dreams
In weary and punctured times?
If I listen to my body, to my mind
Will I hear those knowing chimes?

In my waking life, in the waking life
In the painful now, in the painful now
I wish for such a visit in the light of day
The light of the truth
I wish for such a visit, I need to know
In the light of day, I need to know

Answers came in dreams
Answers came in dreams
For blessed men of great deed
Like children needing guidance
Their mothers lost in revery

In the waking life, in the waking life
I must try to know, I must try to know
If the answers won't come at night
I will go where they will go, where they will go

In my waking life
In the painful now
I wish for such a visit
In the light of day, the light of truth
I wish for such a visit, I need to know
I need to know

In my waking life
In the painful now
I wish for such a visit
I need to know

In the light of day
The light of truth
I wish for such a visit
I, I need to know

I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
