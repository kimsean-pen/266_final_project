I am sick of this place of death
With a pace that's set
And you know the pessimistic bend
Just to watch you break
Practice what you preach

Separate skin from the bone
Digging at my flesh
Like a schizophrenic with a blade
Fingers tracing scars
Mapping out reminders
Of just how much I can take

Pressure in my brain
My shoulders take the weight
Back's about to break

Pain
Every day that I awake
In my blood and through my veins
Now there's nothing left that you can take away from me

Pain
Because I've seen it before
I've lived it before
I've been there before
Incarnate

So don't you ever underestimate me
Daily death
Crooning in my ear
Things I wanna hear
Turn my head and bite my tongue
Spitting blood on my pre-determined grave
This is all a game

Pressure in my brain
My shoulders take the weight
Back's about to break
This is all a game

Pain
Every day that I awake
In my blood and through my veins
Now there's nothing left that you can take away from me

Pain
Every day that I awake
In my blood and through my veins

Now there's nothing left
Nothing left that you can take from me
Pain, pain, pain, pain

Footprints in the sand
That can't be washed away
It breeds while we're asleep
It feeds when we awake
Burdens of the flesh
Our bodies are so weak
We seek the spirit's truth
To turn the other cheek

Turning the other cheek to see a world broken, lost and vain
How can you ever look at someone else the same way?
We all bleed
Pain, pain, pain, pain
The human race
Have some empathy
We are all in pain

If we commiserate
Then we can share the weight
We are all the same
We are all in

Pain
Every day that I awake
In my blood and through my veins
Now there's nothing left that you can take away from me

Pain
Every day that I awake
In my blood and through my veins
Now there's nothing left
Nothing left that you can take from me
