Teardrops feel like showers
There's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours
Time stands still around me
Teardrops feel like showers
I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours
With just your broken flowers

Teardrops feel like showers
There's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours
Time stands still around me
Teardrops feel like showers
I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours
With just your broken flowers

Teardrops feel like showers
Teardrops feel like showers
Lying awake for hours
Time stands still around me
Time stands still around me
Time stands still around me
Lying awake for hours
With just your broken flowers

Teardrops feel like showers
Teardrops feel like showers
Lying awake for hours
Time stands still around me
Time stands still around me
Time stands still around me
Lying awake for hours
With just your broken flowers

Teardrops feel like showers
Teardrops feel like showers
Lying awake for hours
Time stands still around me
Time stands still around me
Time stands still around me
Lying awake for hours
With just your broken flowers
