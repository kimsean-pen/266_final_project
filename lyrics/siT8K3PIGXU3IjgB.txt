Sleep my darling
I don't wanna wake you
I'll see you again
Sleep my dear
I hope you treat me sweetly
But I'll be gone before you wake up
I won't talk much,
Won't try to make the bed out
I think I did it now,
I won't leave my trail, you'll never find me
You belong behind me
Sleep my dear,
Hope you treat me sweetly
But I'll be gone before you wake up,
Before you wake up
