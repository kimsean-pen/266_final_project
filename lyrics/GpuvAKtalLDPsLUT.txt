There are parts of me that have been lost at sea
I feel like I'm sinking into eternity
Walk with my head hung low into calamity
With arms outstretched, for someone, someone to save me

I am a sinking ship, I am the anchors deep
Set to the ocean floor in an eternal sleep
My heart is heavy stone, my body brittle bones
My mind an endless storm out in the cold unknown

'Cause I've got to find my light again
My heart is beating fast, when will this ever end?
Can I find my way back home again?
This road I travel on, it never seems to end

I ain't a hollow shell no more
I've left the ocean floor, I've left the ocean floor
My heart's a heavy hitter now, oh
My lungs, they're screaming out
My heart's a heavy hitter now

I am a sinking ship, I am the anchors deep
Set to the ocean floor in an eternal sleep
My heart is heavy stone, my body brittle bones
My mind an endless storm out in the cold unknown

'Cause I've got to find my light again
My heart is beating fast, when will this ever end?
Can I find my way back home again?
This road I travel on, it never seems to end

And once again you came back, and you rescued me
And I promise you that, I promise you that I'm out
I promise you that I'm out
My heart's a heavy hitter now, oh
My fists are firmly clenched again
And this is thanks to you, my friend

'Cause I've got to find my light again
My heart is beating fast, when will this ever end?
Can I find my way back home again?
This road I travel on, it never seems to end
'Cause I've got to find my light again
My heart is beating fast, when will this ever end?
Can I find my way back home again?
This road I travel on, it never seems to end
