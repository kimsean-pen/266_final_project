I woke the same as any other day
Except a voice was in my head
It said, "Seize the day, pull the trigger
Drop the blade and watch the rolling heads"
The day I tried to live

I stole a thousand beggar's change
And gave it to the rich, yeah
The day I tried to win

I dangled from the power lines
And let the martyrs stretch, yeah
Singing one more time around
(Might do it)

One more time around
(Might make it)
One more time around
(Might do it)
One more time around
(might make it)
The day I tried to live
Words you say, never seem
To live up to the ones inside your head

The lives we make never seem
To ever get us anywhere but dead
The day I tried to live
I wallowed in the blood and mud
With all the other pigs, hey
Singing one more time around

(Might do it)
One more time around
(Might make it)

One more time around
(Might do it)
One more time around
(Might make it)
The day I tried to live, yeah, I tried
I woke the same as any other day you know
I should have stayed in bed
The day I tried to win I wallowed
In the blood and mud with all the other pigs

And I learned that I was a liar
(One more time around)

I learned that I was a liar
(One more time around)
I learned that I was a liar

(One more time around)
I learned that I was a liar
(One more time around)
Singing one more time around

(Might do it)
One more time around
(Might make it)
One more time around
(Might do it)
One more time around
The day I tried to live
Just like you
Just like you
One more time around
One more time around
