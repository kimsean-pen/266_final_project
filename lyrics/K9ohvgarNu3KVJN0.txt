Of all the things you might
Still want to satellite
You took the star that you know won't shine as bright
We're falling from the sky

And the look in your eye
Is telling me that you won't be home tonight
No you won't be home tonight

Hands on the water, I find
That I could run away before you realize
And where the border, divides
I see the darkness that is haloed in your eyes

Of all the things you hide
I hear in each reply
You'll never stand up against the rising tide
The blue and red collide

And the look in your eyes
Is telling me that the dawn won't end the night
No the dawn won't end the night

Oh lord,

Do you hear us calling out?
Hands on the water, I find
That it's impossible to make you change your mind
And where the border, divides
I see the darkness that is haloed in your eyes

Oh lord,

Do you see us breaking down?

Oh lord,

Do you hear us calling out?
Hands on the water, I find
That it's impossible to make you change your mind
And where the border divides
I see the darkness that is haloed in your eyes.
