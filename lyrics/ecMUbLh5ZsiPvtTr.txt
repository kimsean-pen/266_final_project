Broken light's the only light I know
How to make it through this world alone
Love has become strange and then estranged
Ended there, but there it starts again

Obsession, position
Ecstatic, deception
Trick and defiance
Bounds of desire
It's your sin, peace begins within
(I'm never gonna try again)
It's your sin, peace begins within
(The world is a place where the light gets in)

Said you'll let emotion burn away
Stare into the darkness of the day
Images are not like memories
Lovers take the plunder, then they leave

Obsession, position
Temptation, transgression
We're second, we're active
The script is pre-destined
The show of sin
It's your sin, peace begins within
(I'm never gonna try again)
It's your sin, peace begins within
(The world is a place where the light gets in)
It's your sin, peace begins within
(I'm never gonna try again)
It's your sin, peace begins within
(The world is a place where the light gets in)

It's your sin, peace begins within
(I'm never gonna try again)
It's your sin, peace begins within
(The world is a place where the light gets in)

The world is a place where the light gets in
