He-e-ey
He-e-ey
Ooooh

I'm the kinda girl who doesn't say a word
Who sits at the curb and waits for the world
But I'm about to break out, about to break out
I'm like a crook tonight
I caught you staring at me and I was thinking clearly
Now I'm like a bee and I'm huntin' for the honey
And I'm kinda shy but, you're super fly, yeah
I could be your kryptonite

Like ohhh
Light my heart up, baby, like a matchstick
Ohhh
And hit the gas quick

Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young
In the crowd the music's loud but I will find you

Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it, fa la la la la la la and I'll find you

Ready or not
Ready or not

Hello my name is (Bridgit)
Nice to meet you
I think you're famous, where have I seen you?
You'll be my William, I'll be your Kate
Livin' like a fairytale

We could have a palace right next to Oprah
37 cars and a yacht down in Boca
Take me away, wherever you say
Yeah, we could be setting sail

Like ohhh
Light my heart up, baby, like a matchstick
Ohhh
And hit the gas quick

Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young
In the crowd the music's loud but I will find you

Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it, fa la la la la la la and I'll find you

Ready or not
Ready or not, not

Ready or not, here I come, here I come
You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs
You and me dance from the night to the dawn
Ready or not, here I come, boy, it's on

Ready or not, here I come, here I come
You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs
You and me dance from the night to the dawn
Ready or not, here I come, boy, it's on

Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young
Yeah, in the crowd the music's loud but I will find you

Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it, fa la la la la la la and I'll find you

Ready or not
You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs
Ready or not (here I come)
Woahh, ohhh
Ready or not, ready or not
Ready or not
Ready or not, ready or not
Boombada, oombada, oombada
Ready or not
