I don't really know what you're thinking
But I know what we're drinking
Let me put your night in drive

Cat walking on the runway,
Tripping long on the highway,
Going home is only right, yeah

Can't see nothing but blur lines,
Acting like it's your first time, hey-hey, hey
Girl, I'm done with these games,
And you need to get in my lane
Pushing it to the red line
Hey, hey hey

Girl, you know that you want it,
And you know where we're going,
Girl, you know where we're going,
And you know that you want it.
Girl, get in my ride. Girl, get in my ride. Girl, get in my...
Turn the lights out, put the top down,
Are you ready for the fast life?
Turn the lights out, put the top down,
Are you ready for the fast life?

When I'm in the streets, I'm speedin'
In the sheets, no reason
Lookin' in your eyes I see the signs
Put the start up, louder than a siren
Then we focus on silence
Then go on another ride

Can't see nothing but blur lines, hey-hey-hey
Acting like it's your first time, hey-hey-hey
Girl, I'm done with these games,
And you need to get in my lane,
Pushing it into the red line
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Girl, you know that you want it,
And you know where we're going,
Girl, you know where we're going,
And you know that you want it
Girl, get in my ride. Girl, get in my ride. Girl, get in my...
Turn the lights out, put the top down,
Are you ready for the fast life?
Turn the lights out, put the top down,
Are you ready for the fast life?

Look,

Are you ready for the fast life?
