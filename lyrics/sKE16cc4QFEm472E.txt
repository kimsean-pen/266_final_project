Tell me was it all worth it
to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low
BLEGH
Sunk this low
So who's left to count the cost?
Beneath the ruin lies a story of the lives lost
now we're gone, left without a trace,
but we took something they cannot replace
A match made in heaven
paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
Cold blooded retribution
So fuck your revolution
You chew up peace and spit it out as war
You've been feeding the wolf that's waiting at the door
You are rotten to the core
We found your fingerprints all over the trigger
If you're looking for tyrants,
take a look in the mirror
BLEGH
You knew all along,
that the cancer would spread,
So don't be surprised to find a price on your head
Sorry son, but we destroyed your home,
we murdered your family,
now you're on your own
Collateral damage, face down in the sand
Watch the dominoes fall,
it's all just part of the plan
A match made in heaven
paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
Cold blooded retribution
So fuck your revolution
A match made in heaven
paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
And every execution, the price of your collusion
You knew all along,
that the cancer would spread,
So don't be surprised to find a price on your head
Tell me was it all worth it
to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low
Sunk this low
You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core
