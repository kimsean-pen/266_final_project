How many times have I tried to turn this love around?
I don't wanna give up but, baby
It's time I had two feet on the ground (ground, ground, ground)
Can you release me?
Can you release me?

Now that you're gone I can't help myself from wondering
Oh if you'd have come down
From your high, would we've been all right?
Release me!
Can you release me?

Come on, baby
Come on, baby, you knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Come on, darlin', hear me, darlin'!
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That, baby, you've just got to release me

Release me!
Release me!

I'm not going back to you anymore
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow
So stop coming around my door! (door) (door)
'Cause you're not gonna find
What you're looking for
Whoa-oh, oh yeah

Come on, baby
Come on, baby, you knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Oh oh oh, baby
Come on, darlin', now hear me, darlin'!
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That, baby, you've just got to release me

(Now tell me)
What is this power you've got on me? (What is this power)
What is this power (What is it, what is it)

Come on, baby
Come on, baby, you knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Oh oh oh oh, baby
Come on, darlin', now hear me, darlin'!
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That, baby, you've just got to release me
