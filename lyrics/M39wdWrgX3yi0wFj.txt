Diamonds shine like stars beneath the ground,
Little rivers run in rings around the town,
And everyone's a soldier just marching towards the ocean.
Then we know we've packed up all we had to move from '93.

Everyone is golden, everyone is golden,
And nobody will love them, and nobody will love them.
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden,
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden.

And we took a train into the town,
And stuck another needle in the ground,
If we never get another sound
Then we know we've packed up all we had to move from '93.

Everyone is golden, everyone is golden,
Nobody will love them, nobody will love them.
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden,
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden.

And they can't lift you up.
We gathered around the school
To hear just what they found,
But they told us they had tried,
Still the little boy had died.

We gathered around to hear just what they'd done,
Yeah, they shine like stars under the ground,
And everyone's a soldier just marching towards the ocean.
Then we know we've packed up all we had to move from '93.

Everyone is golden, everyone is golden,
Nobody will love them, nobody will love them.
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden,
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden.

Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.

Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.
