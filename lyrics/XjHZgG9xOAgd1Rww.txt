Got a big plan, this mindset
Maybe its right
At the right place, and right time
Maybe tonight
And the whisper or handshake
Sending a sign
Wanna make out and kiss hard
Wait nevermind

Late night in passing
Mention it flip to her
Best friend, it's no thing
Maybe it slipped
But the slip turns to terror
And a crush to light
Then she walked in he froze up
Believe it's the fright

It's cute in a way
Till you cannot speak
And you leave to have a cigarette
Knees get weak
Escape was just a nod
And a casual wave
Obsessed about it
Heavy for the next two days

It's only just a crush
It'll go away
It's just like all the others
It'll go away
Or maybe this is danger
And you just don't know
You pray it all away
But it continues to grow

I want to hold you close
Skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, and close your eyes girl
So lovely, it feels so right

I want to hold you close
Soft breath, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear
I want to fucking tear you apart

Then he walked up and told her
Thinking maybe it'd pass
And they talked and looked away a lot
Doing the dance
Her hand brushed up against his
She left it there
Told him how she felt
And then they locked in a stare

They took a step back, thought about it
What should they do?
Cause there's always repercussions
When you're dating in school
But their lips met
And reservations started to pass
Whether this was just an evening
Or a thing that would last

Either way he wanted her
And this was bad
Wanted to do things to her
It was making him crazy
Now a little crush
Turned into a like
And now he wants to grab her
By the hair and tell her

I want to hold you close
Skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, and close your eyes girl
So lovely, it feels so right

I want to hold you close
Soft breast, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear
I want to fucking tear you apart

I want to hold you close
Skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, and close your eyes girl

So lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close
Soft breast, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear
I want to fucking tear you apart
I want to hold you close
Skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, and close your eyes girl
So lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close
Soft breast, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear
I want to fucking tear you apart
