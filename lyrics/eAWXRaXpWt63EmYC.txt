Outside there's a man who can't make up his mind
Looking for something he may never
And he's got a girl with blisters
Who tries to understand
She's in love with a complicated man

But I never found it so hard
No, I never was so confused
Cause I never found
Anyone so absolutely right
As I found it you

It might seem simple, but I'm sure
I just want to be yours
(I just want to be yours)
It won't be easy, but I know
I simply want to be yours
(I just want to be yours)

I know we live in complicated times
And it's so difficult to decide
Who should be our king
And how low we should bow
To lick the boots of a sacred cow

It might seem simple, but I'm sure
I just want to be yours
(I just want to be yours)
It won't be easy, but I know
I simply want to be yours
(I just want to be yours)

I just want to be yours
I simply want to be yours, yours
Oh, I just want to be yours
Oh, I simply want to be yours
