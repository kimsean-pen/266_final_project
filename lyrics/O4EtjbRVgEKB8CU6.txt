There is no other time
No other place
No other day
There is no other time
No other place
No other day
(Cause we're already there)
There is no other time!

I close my eyes,
I feel the flow
Everything is moving forwards, let's let it go
I see it clear it's telling me
Tomorrow is just another story
It's all around, I feel it now
I know that in a moment I can turn around
I see it clear, it's telling me
Tomorrow is standing right in front of me!

Uuuh uuuh uh uh uh
Uuuh uuuh uh uh uh
There is no other time
No other place
No other day
There is no other time
No other place
No other day
(Cause we're already there)
There is no other time

It's in your eyes - within the flow
Everything is moving forwards, let's let it go
I see it clear, no fantasies
Tomorrow is standing right in front of me
You're all around - I feel you now
I know that in a moment we can turn around
I see it clear, no fantasies
Tomorrow is just another story!!

In this moments we're moving forwards
At this moments moving forwards
In this moments moving forwards
At this moments moving forwards

There is no other time
No other place
No other day
There is no other time
No other place
No other day
(Cause we're already there)
There is no other time
There is no other time
No other place
No other day
There is no other time
No other place
No other day
(Cause we're already there)
There is no other time
