The sidewalk's trading love
As subway lights grow brighter
We're just another hype
But the pressure's getting harder

Get on up, get on up
Take it much higher

Get on up, get on up
Take it much higher

A lovers' etiquette
Make love on first impression
And adolescent sex with juvenile intentions

Get on up, get on up
Take it much higher

Get on up, get on up
Take it much higher

Whatever gets you through the night
Just keep on dancing
Whatever gets you through the night
Just keep on dancing
Whatever gets you through the night
Just keep on dancing
Whatever gets you through the night

Get on up, get on up
Take it much higher
Get on up, get on up
Take it much higher
Get on up, get on up, get on up
Take it much higher
Get on up, get on up, get on up
Take it much higher
Get on up, get on up, get on up
Take it much higher

Well, the lady buys a thrill
Excitement in succession
But a heartache won't partake
In articulate obsession

Get on up, get on up, get on up
Take it much higher
Oh yeah!
Get on up, get on up, get on up
Take it much higher

Oh, well, pretty things at rest
No courtesy surprising
For love is heaven blessed
All catastrophies denying

Get on up, get on up, get on up
Take it much higher
Get on up, get on up, get on up
Take it much higher

Just keep on dancing
Whatever gets you through the night
Just keep on dancing
Whatever gets you through the night
Just keep on dancing
Whatever gets you through the night

Aw, when you're out on the street
With your lovers infections
Counting possibilities by elimination
And your body's still damp
From your one-room apartment
And your heartache remains, when
Love's not the antidote
You'll submerge again
Emerge again
Just get off the street!

Whatever gets you through the night
Just keep on dancing
Whatever gets you through the night
Just keep on dancing
Whatever gets you through the night
Just keep on dancing
Whatever gets you through the night

Get on up, get on up, get on up
Take it much higher
Get on up, get on up, get on up
Take it much higher
Get on up, get on up, get on up
Take it much higher
Get on up, get on up, get on up
Take it much higher
Get on up, get on up, get on up
Take it much higher...
