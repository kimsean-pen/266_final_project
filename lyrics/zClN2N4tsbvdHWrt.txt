(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

You've got these little things that you've been running from
You either love them or I guess you don't
You're such a pretty thing to be running from anyone
A vision with nowhere to go

So tell me right now, you think you're ready for it?
I wanna know why you got me going
So let's go, we'll take it out of here
I think I'm ready to leap, I'm ready to live

I'm ready to go
(Get me out of my mind)
(Get me out of my mind)
I'm ready to go
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

You've got these little things, you wanted something for them
You either get it or I guess you won't
What does it really mean to get nothing from anyone?
There's a million ways it could go

So tell me right now, you think you're ready for it?
I wanna know why you got me going
So let's go, we'll take it out of here
I think I'm ready to leap, I'm ready to live

I'm ready to go
(Get me out of my mind)
(Get me out of my mind)
I'm ready to go
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

I think I'm ready, I think
I know I'm ready, I know
I think I'm ready, I think
I know I'm ready, I know
I think I'm ready, I think
I know I'm ready, I know
I think I'm ready, I think
I know

I'm ready to go
(Get me out of my mind)
(Get me out of my mind)
I'm ready to go
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm ready to go
(Get me out of my mind)
(Get me out of my mind)
I'm ready to go
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm ready to go
(Get me out of my mind)
(Get me out of my mind)
I'm ready to go
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
