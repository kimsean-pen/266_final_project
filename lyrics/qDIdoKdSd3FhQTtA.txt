Skies are alit
A jittery grid
That leans in pale grey
Onto towering pillars
Trying to build
A cover for wilt
So dreams neverberate
Between the windows held ajar by
Arduous arms
The peccable ones
They are crowbars in the sleet
They are levers of defeat

Noisy with light
So goes the night
They are crowbars in the sleet
They are crowbars in the sleet

The prayers that flee
Up vertically
They are levers of defeat
They are levers of defeat
