We were stars and stripes

Now we're black and blue
We were high as kites every afternoon
We were speeding fines smoking morning dew
Smoking morning dew, smoking morning dew We were walking art
We were damaged goods
We were holding on though we never should
We were heads and tails crashing every move
Crashing every move, crashing every move Dancing but we keep on falling down
Ohh ohh hey
Touching only when you want it now
Hey Love me like you did like when you were high
Need me like you do like you're drunk blind
Love me like you did like when you were high
Like when you were high We were energy Now we're power out
We were empathy but we're sour now
We were melody, now we're deep house
Now we're deep house, now we're deep house
We were lights on We were clothes off
We were no rules We would play it rough
Weren't making love, love was making us
Love was making us, making us
Dancing but we keep on falling down
Ohh ohh hey
Touching only when you want it now
Hey Love me like you did like when you were high
Need me like you do like you're drunk blind
Love me like you did like when you were high
Like when you were high If this is what you call real love
Then why am I always hurting?
How come when you hold me close I can feel my body burning?
You say you can't with out me
Then why you gotta leave me hanging
Then why you gotta leave me hanging
Ohh Love me like you did like when you were high
Need me like you do like you're drunk blind
Love me like you did like when you were high Like when you were high
