The word is out now
And nobody cares
They're on the dance floor
And the roof is caving in
Run out and find some help
Light a fire up on the hill

Don't you dare turn your back again
There's no cure for the things you found with your eyes
I'll be you and you can still be me
For there's no rule, so cut the world in two halves for us

There's a little bit left inside your
There's a little bit left inside your heart

I lost track how my love forgets
Burn and score, let the future cut it's neck
Before we go hit the lights and close the door
You will see I can be so naive
You will see I can be so naive
