This is our burden
The pain we endure

We must carry it together
It will soon become a memory
It's staring us in the face
But we just turn the other way
Take the easy route
While millions of people's homes fall to the ground
Merciless and unforgiving as it sets us back
The truth could bury us all in the end

You and I walk carefully as we lighten our step
And hope our tracks just disappear
We don't want to leave an imprint
This can't be what we're known for

I'll leave the world as it was given to me
Flowing full of life and filled with diversity
I'll leave the world as it was given to me
Flowing full of life and filled with diversity

I can look with pride in my child's eyes
And he will know I helped preserve what may have died
He will know what I've done
What I've done

We will look ahead
The trail I've left won't lead the history books
Right back to me
Right back to me
This generation won't let it all just slip away
Slip away, slip away
Don't let it slip away

I'll walk forward and sense the ground beneath me
The choice is mine
I need to make the right one
The earth may remember what we have done
The choice is mine
I need to make the right one
