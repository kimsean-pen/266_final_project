the parasites will love you when you're dead
la la la, la la
hiding all the rattles in the bed
la la la, la la
come crawling in
with bulging eyes
now I can see
there's a bad moon on the rise

raking all the gravels from the tracks
la la la, la la
forget about the daggers in the backs
la la la, la la
scream cross the lawn
with fire in her hair
millionaires come tumbling
down the stairs

a big wind spitting female
rain and teeth
la la la, la la
the dark wolves fell upon me
wools and fleece
la la la, la la
come crawling in
with bulging eyes
now I can see
there's a bad moon on the rise
