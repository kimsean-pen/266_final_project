The car crunches gravel
And the wind licks at you
This dark spell you're under
Has you dumbstruck by the gate

And it hurts every muscle
Just to walk back to the house
Now this home that you both made
It looks haunted from the yard

You can hear those distant bells
And you know they'll never leave
It's like your church is crying out
Like the wolf calls to her young

And the dark never enters
But it also never leaves
And this spark that he gave you
Is just an ember all but out

If he'd one eye on the exit
Oh you never would have known
Until he drove off in the darkness
Like some slowly fading song

You can hear those distant bells
And you know they'll never leave
It's like your church is crying out
Like the wolf calls to her young

You can hear those distant bells
And you know they'll never leave
It's like your church is crying out
Like the wolf calls to her young
