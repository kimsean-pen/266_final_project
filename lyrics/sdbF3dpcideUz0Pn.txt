Climb the wall and leave it all behind
Climb the wall and leave it all behind

You've got so much on your table
And I now that you are able
But you're hiding in your cradle
Trying to rock it all away

You're sailing where the driftwood goes
You're falling from the sky like stone

You're the lifeline not the dead zone
The foundation, not the headstone
Many things you need to let go
Many things you need to start

And I know that your dependents
May be pleased with your attention
But I know it's worth a mention
That it's tearing them apart

And sometimes it's a hard road

Maybe it's elusive (so hard to find your way)
But you know just what the truth is (you feel it every day)
And maybe it's intrusive (won't seem to go away)
But you know you've got to do it (let go of yesterday)
Until it's done

Showed you wisdom showed you wonders
That you cannot pull asunder
And there's no curse that you're under
Cause it's over, gone away
Now you have all you need

All the stores are full, your wings are strong
Now it's time to compete
You can run the race and carry on
