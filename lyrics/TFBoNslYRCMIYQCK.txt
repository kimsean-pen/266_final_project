Where you been?
Where you been all my life?
Baby this is it, the way you
look in the light.
It's obvious that I want somthing
from you.
You know what, what I wanna do,
do, do.
Every touch, it would
bring me to life.
I can only imagine,
only imangine, what it'lll
be like.
Oh every time,
it would bring me to life.
I can only imangine, only imangine,
what it would be like.
What it would be like,
What it would be like, like, like
What it would be like, like, like
I saw you from afar
Thoght I would say "Wassup"
You can tell me your name, when were
breaking up
Call me Tuechi, I'm good, I'm Gucci
Now you can kiss your old dude goodbye: smooches
You're a beast, yo-you're a beauty
Man, I think somebody did gave Cupid an Uzi -- shoot me
You're a firework, brighter in the darkSo let's turn off the lights and give me that spark

If we touched it would bring me to life
I could only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time
It would bring me to life
I could only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
What it'd be like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, likeI want to let her touch me
One touch will feel free (it would bring me to life)

So I can finally see (yeah! kiss me now)
So I can finally see (kiss me now)
