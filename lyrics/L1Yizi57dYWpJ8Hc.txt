You sure you want to be with me, I've nothing to give
Won't lie and say this lovin's best
Leave us in emotional peace, take a walk, taste the rest
Now take a rest

I see you digging a hole in your neighbourhood
You're crazy, but you're lazy
No need to live in a lean to
Your troubles must be seen to
See through money like it's paper
With faces I remember
I drink on a daily basis
Though it's seldom, cools my temper
It never cools my temper

Walking through the suburbs, though not exactly lovers
You're a couple, especially when your body's doubled
Duplicate, and then you wait for the next Kuwait

You sure you want to be with me, I've nothing to give
Now take a walk, take a rest, taste the rest
Take a walk, take a rest, taste the rest

Don't wanna be on top of your list
Monopoly and properly kissed
We overcome in sixty seconds with the strength we have to together
But for now, emotional ties, they stay severed
When there's trust there'll be treats
And when we funk, we'll hear beats

Deflowering my baby, are you my baby mate?
I must be crazy, see I'm swazy
You're digging a hole in your neighborhood
You're crazy but you're lazy, must be lazy

Don't wanna be on top of your list
Monopoly and properly kissed

Deflowering my baby, are you my baby mate, my baby

Delowering my baby, are you my baby mate?

I must be crazy, you must be lazy

Karmacoma, what?
