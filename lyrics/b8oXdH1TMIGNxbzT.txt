Drop the charges!
(Ukrainian)
The fire and the power, yuh?!

(Ukrainian)

(In the old time it was not a crime, drop the charges,
Don't you realise the sun rises?)

(Drop the charges, man! Drop the charges!)

(Right you are! And this time, let the people know...)

In the old time, in the old time,
In the old time it was not a crime!
(What are you talking about?)
In the old time, in the old time,
In the old time it was not a crime!

Not a crime!
(It's all nonsensical!)
Not a crime!

In the old time, in the old time,
In the old time it was not a crime!
In the old time, in the old time,
In the old time it was not a crime!

(*coughs*)
Not a crime!
Drop the charges!
Not a crime!
Not a crime!
Not a crime!

Reality!

(Ukrainian)

Spices, creation, realisation, naturalisation,
What are you talking about? It's all about time 'cos today you go to nature.

Not a crime!
In the old time, in the old time,
In the old time it was not a crime!
In the old time, in the old time,
In the old time it was not a crime!

(Not a crime, not a crime!)
Not a crime!
Not a crime!
Not a crime!
Drop the charges, man!
Not a crime!
Drop the charges!

(Ukrainian)
Not a crime!
(Ukrainian)
Not a crime!
(It's not a crime, it's legal - perfectly natural).
