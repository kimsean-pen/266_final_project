They preach to the choir
Always in the permanent daylight
They toss paper tigers
From their perfect porcelain skylines

(Listen for the sound)
For the sound, for the sound
(As it all comes crashing down)
As it all comes crashing down

(Listen for the sound)
For the sound, for the sound
(As it all comes crashing down)
As it all comes crashing

They preach to the choir
Always in the permanent daylight
They toss paper tigers
From their shatterproof spires

Light the world on fire
Just to watch it burn
It'll be their funeral pyre
But they never seem to learn

Light the world on fire
Just to watch it burn
It'll be their funeral pyre
But they never seem to learn

(Listen for the sound)
For the sound, for the sound
(As it all comes crashing down)
As it all comes crashing down

(Listen for the sound)
For the sound, for the sound
(As it all comes crashing down)
As it all comes crashing down

We paid the price
We paid for their crimes
With our blood...
