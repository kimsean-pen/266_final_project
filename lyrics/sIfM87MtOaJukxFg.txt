They say: Don't ever meet your heroe
Reverence is temporary
Until the truth comes out
Do yourself a favor die young
Ignorance is celebrated
Don't let dark sides come out

Keep your eyes closed
If you're ever gonna stand for something
Keep your head down, closed
If you want to keep your mouth don't run it
Shut that shit down

If you need some company
You should meet these obligations
What's responsibility
It ain't permanent vacations
(Down, down down)
Yeah you think you give a great hug
(Down, down down)
No, Yeah you think you give a great hug
(Shut that shit down, down, down)
No, yeah you squish your little face smug
(Down, down, down,)
Oh, Oh, Oh
(Shut that shit down, down, down)

Fear it

Lately, I've been feeling like all my friends I used to love
Have turned out to be sociopaths
Do they even know what it's like in the real world?
Too busy getting high
Now their vacancies are a reminder of
All the ways I used to sell myself
Lack of compassion down for the cause
Feeding the fever whatever the cost

Wanna deify opinion
Evidence is secondary
East-west equals North-south
Do yourself a favor die young
Ignorance is advocated
Don't let gospel burn out

Keep your eyes closed
If you're ever gonna stand for something
Keep your head down, closed
If you want to keep your mouth don't run it
Shut that shit down

If you need some company
You should meet these obligations
What's responsibility
It ain't permanent vacation
(Down, down down)
Yeah you think you give a great hug
(Down, down down)
No, Yeah you think you give a great hug
(Shut that shit down, down, down)
No, yeah you squish your little face smug
(Down, down, down,)
Oh, Oh, Oh
(Shut that shit down, down, down)
Oh, Yeah you got your validation huh?
(Shut that shit down, down, down)
Yeah be your own patient
(Down, down, down)
Oh, Yeah you got your validation huh?
(Down, down, down)
Yeah you squish your little face smug
(Down, down, down)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
(Shut that shit down, down, down)
