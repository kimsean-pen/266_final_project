Saw right through me,
Staying started to unglue me
And I knew that I couldn't win
I Wanna steal your love, stop holdin' the dove
Just to pull my good luck in

On a rope, on a rope, got me hanging on a rope
On a rope, on a rope, got me hanging on a rope
On a rope, on a rope, got me hanging on a rope
On a rope, on a rope, got me hanging on a rope
On a rope, on a rope, got me hanging on a rope
On a rope, on a rope, got me hanging on a rope
On a rope, on a rope, got me hanging on a rope

Same old story, yeah it's getting kind of gory
Throw my all time low away
Spit turns into a treasure, taste the blind side of life
Choke words that I can't say
No gun, no bomb, no way I'll run
Too bad, I'm not in shape
Too little, too late, that deal's so chaste
Do burning hands seem to care?

All right, I'm ready--the wild sound's gonna take me away
That beat's so steady
Make me fall to my knees, just start crying
No, no, no no no no no no no please no
