Whoa, it's morning
and we slept the night away
it happened
now we can't turn back the hands of time, no, no
yes we've stolen this moment
we forgot to face one simple fact
we both belong to someone else
as we slept the night away
it's morning
sunlight shines across your sleeping face, oh
a new day
brings reality and we both go our separate ways
what a lovely night we had yeah, yeah
as we shared each other's love
we forgot about all the pain we caused
as we slept the night away
as we lay
we forgot about tomorrow
as we lay
ooh hey, hey
as we lay
didn't think about
the price we'd have to pay
no, no, no
it's morning
and now it's time for us to say goodbye
goodbye baby
you're leaving me
i know you've got to hurry home to face your wife, wife
i would never want to hurt her, no, no, no
she would never understand
you belong to me for just one night
as we slept the night away
ooh oh, whoa
i would never, never want to hurt her, no, no, no
she would never understand
you belong to me for just one night
as we slept the night away
as we lay
we forgot about tomorrow
as we lay
ooh hey, hey
as we lay
didn't think about
the price we'd have to pay
no, no, no
we should have counted up the cost
but instead we got lost
in the second, in the minute
in the hour, hey, hey, hey
as we lay
we forgot about tomorrow
as we lay
oh no, oh no, no
my love why can't you see
how loving you is killing me
i can't think of no one else
baby, baby i can't take it no more
you see i can't be in your life
you gotta go home to you wife
oh it's morning
