Oh no
Don't go changin'
That's what you told me from the start
Thought you were somethin' different
That's when it all just fell apart
Like your so perfect
And I can't measure up
Well I'm not perfect
Just all messed up

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
And I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
'Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
'Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

It's not like i need somebody
Telling me where I should go at night
Don't worry you'll find somebody
Someone to tell how to live their life
'Cause your so perfect
And no one measures up
Yeah all by yourself
Your all messed up

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
'Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
'Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

Now wait a minute
Because of you
I never knew all of the things that I had
Hey don't you get it
I'm not going anywhere with you tonight
'Cause this is my life

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see (now I see yeah)
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me (end of you and me)
Cause the girl that you want
(That you want)
She was tearing us apart
'Cause she's everything

Everything i'm not
But now i see
(I don't wanna) I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
'Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
'Cause she's everything
Everything.
I'm not.
