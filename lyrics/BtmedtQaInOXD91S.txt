In a world of haunting mirrors,
your eyes should of been closed.
Instead you lost your shadow,
to become, like them, a ghost.

Immersed within a mist of death,
you withered in the light
and left your disillusioned soul
to tremble in the night.

Look beyond the fear and take it back.
The contours of your spirit
make them black.
You just have to

(Give in) to the hunger.
(Give in) to the solitude.
(Give in) to the rapture of life.
Give in to darkness.
Mass Darkness.

You just have to give in.

Complete the shadow's circle
to become all that you are.
Surrender to the darkness
to shine just like a star.

You just have to
(Give in) to the hunger.
(Give in) to the solitude.
(Give in) to the sanctity of your heart.
Give in to darkness.
Mass Darkness.
(Give in) to the fire.
(Give in) to the cold.
(Give in) to the rapture of life.
Give in to darkness.
Mass Darkness
