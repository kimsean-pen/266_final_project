help does not just walk up to you i could have told you that
i'm not an idiot
i could have told you that
in every serpent's eye watch you go where you go
every serpents double tongue takes a turn with your soul
if you let them ring your bell (x2)
they're ringing the bell (x2)
why wouldn't i be trying to figure it out
everyone tells you that
everyone tells you not to quit
i can't even see it to fight it
if it looks like i'm not trying i don't care what it looks like
cause i stood at the alter and everything turned white
all I heard was the sound... of the world coming down around me (x2)
why wouldn't i be trying
why wouldn't i try (x2)
cause those double tongues are singing hear the wail of the choir through the fog
the sound of that choir through the fog
they're always close they're always so close always close always so close
if there's a way out it will be step by step through the black (x2)
why wouldn't i be trying to figure it out it don't mean i'm not trying if i don't make it back
i know serpents will cross universes to circle around our necks
i know hounds will cross universes to circle around our feet
i know they're close
step by step one's beside me to kill me or to guide me
why wouldn't i be trying to figure which one out (x2)
