I want to kiss him
I want to kiss her
I want to run my fingers through your hair
and hear you say you've never done this before with someone like me
I want to run my fingers through your hair
and tell you that I've never done this before
with someone like you

I wanna tell you
I wanna hear you

So he wasn't born that long ago
and the disciples weren't organised
but if your god is valid why isn't mine?
And if you close your eyes
we'll still be dancing till the end of time

Tell me that you've never felt like this before
