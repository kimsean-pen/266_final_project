Come on in, sweetie-pie
Have an apple, have some lye...
Leave your friends, righteous and pathetic, standing at the door
On the books, all your bets, favor head-bands and cassettes
Cigarettes, suffragettes, and bores

What to do?
Sweetheart, you'll find
Mediocre people do exceptional things all the time
Oh, the ruin will do in your talented mind...
Could've been a genius if you'd had an axe to grind

When we moved to the city
It seemed the competition got so much less pretty
But the mirror's never failed you like this before
So your revenge on the world
Will be pencils through your curls
And if wanting ever taught you anything, it's wanting more
And more and more and more

What to do?
Sweetheart, you'll find
Mediocre people do exceptional things all the time
Oh, the ruin will do in your talented mind...
Could've been a genius if you'd had an axe to grind
What to do?
What to do?

When that day finally nears
You'll at least have made it clear
That compassion's just a nicer way of looking down your nose
It seems that all the people want to do
Is crowd the streets of
Amsterdam (Pamplona, too)
But the bulls have already come and gone and bellowed all their lows
Now nobody knows

What to do?
Sweetheart, you'll find
Mediocre people do exceptional things all the time
Oh, the ruin will do in your talented mind...
Could've been a genius if you'd had an axe to grind
What to do?
What to do?
Oh, what to do? Oh, what to do? What to do?
