It's so relieving to show my ray
Beam of belief in identity
It's not deceiving to be this way
I came to show you my sack

The things that you do with your attitude
I'm awkward, I'm chipper, I'm random, dude
The picture, I like it, so don't be rude
We all came here just to fap

I'm in love with the feeling that I'm loved
(Not alone, so alone)
Take my money, take all that I've got
(All that I've got)

And I'm day-, day-, daydreaming of a taste I can't hold back

Only I share with the lesson, I'm mocking it
Letting the pear flip its shape
Top of the tumor, it's rumored I'm neutered
A fabulous rape in the taint

I'm in love with the feeling that I'm loved
(Not alone, so alone)
Stroke my ego, turn me into God
I am God

Expecting the people to live in your head
If you knew what to do, then you'd do what you said
Proxy the awesome and seek the
deletion of reaper repeating submission face
Opt for the option to stop this
exhaustion and breathe through the tube of civility
The end is, the end is, the end is, the end of days

And we can get it in the open
Tell me all your secrets
Show me how to make you mine
Cuz you got me feeling nervous
Know I don't deserve it
But you're giving me the signs

I bet you never saw me coming
But I've had my eye on you for miles
Just had to get it in the open
Take off all your clothes and
Baby let me blow your mind (Whoooaa)
Baby let me blow your mind (Whoooaa)
Cuz I need it the most, so baby let me blow your mind

And I'll keep hiding in this cul de sac
Day-, day-, daydreaming of a taste I can't hold back

I have something important to-
I'm in love with the feeling that I'm loved
(Not alone, so alone)
Stroke my ego, turn me into God
Is there a god?
