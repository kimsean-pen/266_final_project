I was just that old
That August dark, dark day
Swear that you never saw her face
Swear that you never heard her say

No spoken word
No small command
What was it she wanted
They say she had everything

No spoken word
No small command
What was it she wanted
They say she had everything

What shall I do
What shall I say
Should I say
Who all the things
That I'd like to say to you

No spoken word
No small command
What was it she wanted
They say she had everyting
Let's make a deal here

Ooh, for one night
Well baby, you fill the night with the
Wind and the rain and the water

Oh, for one night
Well, just for one night
You know that well that
Disasterous sound
Now it will make me wiser
He says, and it will make you look
She says, look out
I don't know how to learn
From the pages of a book

Well I either say too much, or I
I don't say enough
Well I play too hard
Still I'm not tough enough
What was it she wanted
They say she had everything

No spoken word
No small command
What was it she wanted
They said she had everything

Ooh come around tonight indecent
Well
Ah, ha come around
Tonight, indecent baby well,
You fill the room
With the rain and the wind and the water

If you tell me,
One more time
Oh baby, take it easy
Well, you won't see me ever again

Some people walk down that darkened street
With the faith of a child
And so go the faithless
But after awhile, she says

No spoken word
Let's make a deal here
No small command
What was it she wanted
They said she had everything
Ooh, I don't want to know about it
