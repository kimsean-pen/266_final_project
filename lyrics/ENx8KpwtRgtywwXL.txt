I
silently confound
what inheres in
me but is not mine.
Cause I believe in something other
than what's written on the walls.
How we are murdered for the pieces
that are rendering it all.
Now your bringing in the kindle lights,
something to believe in.
Now I'm breathing in the water
that you have parted in the past.
You are walking like your father
and you see it through his eyes.
I've been reading all your markings
you have always tried to hide.
Set aside your feelings,
like you've seen them locked inside.
Unconditionally so steadfast,
how a mother's always right.
And I can feel it in our weakness
we have gained since we were born.
Another tower of strength to leave you
as all the reasons left recede.
And I know, I know
we are walking like were falling,
still there is something you can't see.
Silence comes your way.
Silence come,
silence come.
While we can sense the missing order,
what you created leads you on.
The machine we helped you forging
tells you to wait until it's gone.
You're making all the right decisions
while you are not awake.
Growing from a whisper
the voice inside is still restrained.
And I can see it grow our weakness
into the undefinable.
How we are searching through the debris
now from the fear of being deceived.
And I know, I know.
We are walking like we're falling,
still there is something we can't see.
And I know, I know that
you face a reverence to break through.
To have the freedom of your will.
Those walls once raised by greed
stand tall while we stand still.
Pay no heed,
seized by war.
Hand away our lives and thus
we can spiral on.
