He's a late bloomer he
Knows just what he could be
But he's taking his time
He's a late bloomer he lives in the in-between
But he's getting it right

Like the slowest growing flower
He's essential to your hour
And he's taking his time
Late bloomers still rise

She's a late bloomer she knows just what she could be
But she's taking her time
First she started a seed
She proceed to cut the weeds
But she's facing the sky

Like the slowest growing flower
She's essential to your hour
And she's taking her time
Late bloomers still rise
Like the slowest growing flower
She's essential to your hour
And she's taking her time
Late bloomers still rise
'Cause late bloomers still rise
