Is there somewhere else to be?
Is there another way to feel
The lost pieces all over
Getting closer

Hold up your hands and begin again
Hold up your hands when you reach the end
We live and we work and we die for it
We know our path and we fight for it
Hold up your hands and begin again
Hold up your hands when you reach the end
We live and we work and we die for it
We know our path and collide for it

And begin again
When you reach the end
And begin again
When you reach the end

And begin again
When you reach the end
And begin again
When you reach the end
