Bring out your dead
The smell of decay
Bring out your dead
Living hell everyday

As the rats and the fleas
Keep on breeding
The black death becomes plague
On the sick and the dead
They keep feeding
As the world is dismayed

Bring out your dead
Children singing their rhymes
Bring out your dead
Posies left for the dying

As the rats and the fleas
Keep on breeding
The black death becomes plague
On the sick and the dead
They keep feeding
As the world is dismayed

Bring out your dead
Churches fail to inspire
Bring out your dead
Let us cure with a fire

As the rats and the fleas
Keep on breeding
They atone for their sins
On the sick and the dead
They keep feeding
Satan's blame now begins
