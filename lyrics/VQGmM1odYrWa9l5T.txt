Chosen
Things are chosen for you
Setting
Stones are thrown at you
Questions
Everything is outside
Settings
Sunset station petting shadows

Nomad never home
No matter where you go
Cut down like they cut you
No matter what you do

Messes
Wander through the ages
Faces
Hidden from the day
Shiny
Levels under touch you
Dreams are like water to the fires of nightmare lives

Nomad never home
No matter where you go
Push them like they push you
No matter what you do

Nomad never home
No matter where you go
