You called me after midnight
Must have been three years since we last spoke
I slowly tried to bring back
The image of your face from the memories so old
I tried so hard to follow
But didn't catch a half of what had gone wrong
Said, "I don't know what I can save you from"

I don't know what I can save you from
I asked you to come over
And within half an hour you were at my door
I'd never really known you
But I realized that the one you were before
Had changed into somebody
For whom I wouldn't mind to put the kettle on
Still I don't know what I can save you from
I don't know what I can save you from
