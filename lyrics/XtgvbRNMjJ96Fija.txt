You can't do everything at once but you can do anything you want
Your autonomy can't be brought into question by anything
'Til you've turned around and say that every year is like a day
And you have given it away
You give it all away, you give it

And now everything at once becomes the only thing that you want
You're a defeated man and your plans will not be executed
And the life that you believed you'd lead is starting to recede
And you have given it away
Give it all away, you give it away

When enough is enough and it's all too much for anyone
When you're out on your own, everybody's alone
When you push and you shove and you gotta keep the pressure on
All you need is some love and a way to get home

You can't do everything at once but when you try to ...
When all the others come running until you're busy doing nothing
And another day is dawning as another setting sun
And you have given it away
Give it all away, you give it away

When enough is enough and it's all too much for anyone
When you're out on your own, everybody's alone
When you push and you shove and you gotta keep the pressure on
All you need is some love and a way to get home

And I want to be us, I don't want to be them
And I want to be now, I don't want to be then
And I want to be real, I don't want to pretend
And I want to begin, I don't want it to end
And I want it to start, I don't want it to break
And I want it to mend, I don't wanna be fake
And I wanted to give, want to give it away
Want to give it away, want to give it away

Everything at once but you can't do anything you want
Your autonomy can't be brought into question by anything
'Til you've turned around and say that every year is like a day
And you have given it away
Give it all away, you give it away

When enough is enough and it's all too much for anyone
When you're out on your own, everybody's alone
When you push and you shove and you gotta keep the pressure on
All you need is some love and a way to get home
