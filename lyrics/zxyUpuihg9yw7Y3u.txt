I wash away
In your river of gold
I'm losing this
On these dead-end roads

And I'm lost in the waters
Your light is my shore
I'm searching for answers
Because all I know is I'm losing hope

I'm bathing in sunshine, lost in space
Waiting for your sign to set me straight
Where do I go from here?
When will this road seem clear?
I'm bathing in sunshine, lost in space
Waiting for your sign to set me straight
Where do I go from here?
When will this road seem clear?
I'm bathing in sunshine
I'm bathing in sunshine

I stay afloat
In these jeans of stones
This heavy road
It don't take me home

And I'm lost in the waters
Your light is my shore
I'm searching for answers
Because all I know is I'm losing hope

I'm bathing in sunshine, lost in space
Waiting for your sign to set me straight
Where do I go from here?
When will this road seem clear?
I'm bathing in sunshine, lost in space
Waiting for your sign to set me straight
Where do I go from here?
When will this road seem clear?
I'm bathing in sunshine
