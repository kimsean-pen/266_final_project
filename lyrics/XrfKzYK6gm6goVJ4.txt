From Cape Cod Light to the Mississip, to San Francisco Bay,
They're talking about this famous place, down Greenwich Village way

And so I got my banjo out, just sittin', catchin' dust,
And painted right across the face "Greenwich Village or Bust."

And so I got my banjo out, just sittin' and catchin' dust,
And painted right across the face "Greenwich Village or Bust."

And so I got my banjo out, just sittin' and catchin' dust,
And painted right across the face "Greenwich Village or Bust."

And so I got my banjo out, just sittin' and catchin' dust,
And painted right across the face "Greenwich Village or Bust."

And so I got my banjo out, just sittin' and catchin' dust,
And painted right across the face "Greenwich Village or Bust."

My folks were sad to see me go, but I got no meanin' there.
I said "Goodbye, Kansas, Mo, and hello, Washington Square!"
