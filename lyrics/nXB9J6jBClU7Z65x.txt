Loving me right
You fill my dreams with sweetness all through the night
Until the sky turns red
I'm stuck, I'm sugar craving
A honey pool I bathe in

()
Rolling around
Out love is shining like a jewel on a crown
I'll place it on your head
Fit for a ceremony
Say I'm your one and only

(Pre-)
It's so natural, magical, wonderful
Scrambling for what you give, I want it all
And every day a little more, I feel the fall
I feel the fall

()
I'm tumbling down
This wall that I built falls down before me
Crumbling down
Say it's the beginning of a beautiful story
I'm tumbling, crumbling,
Right down to love, to love

()
Down on my knees
You got my temperature 100 degrees
My t-shirt's soaking wet
You bring the heat, the fever
My girl said you'd hurt me but I won't believe her

()
Nothing before
Could ever come between this love I adore
There's nothing she could say
To shock me or surprise me
I'll keep your secrets, be the lock on your diary

(Pre-)
It's so natural, magical, wonderful
Scrambling for what you give, I want it all
And every day a little more, I feel the fall
I feel the fall

I'm tumbling down
This wall that I built falls down before me
Tumbling down
Say it's the beginning of a beautiful story
I'm tumbling, crumbling,
Right down to love, to love

(Bridge)
In your arms, a heaven tailored just for me
A state so calm, yet so full of energy
Brick by brick, you take my pry, give it away
Caught me quick when said I was here to stay

I'm tumbling down ()
I'm tumbling down
This wall that I built falls down before me
Crumbling down
Say it's the beginning of a beautiful story
I'm tumbling, crumbling,
Right down to love, to love
