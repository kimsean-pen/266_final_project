I got electricity running through my veins
I got everything, who am I to blame?
Stuck like the flowers in the rain
Smoking this dope, I think I'm going insane
Moving through the city
With my keys in the snow
Time running through my hands
I have to let it go, have to let it go
In the shadows of the city, in my mind
Nothing matters anymore, it's just a matter of time
Till we fall back and meet again, feed my needs again
Posted with my friends, I resurrect to rise again

They call me crazy, at least they talking straight
Shock first, so they listen, now that's my faith
Cop a real estate, out in Winterland, made it out
Bless my fate, just be you, it's never too late
All I do is great
Sprinkle the hash, let me live fast
Show up last with the biggest bands
Least love for the biggest fans
I'm a weirdo, so to the weirdos I give back
Roses in my bathtub
Leave your, leave your blood in a black mug
Used to be a hobby, now it's all I think about
That's what rap does
Too many lames tryna do what I've done
Silk print loafers, I don't work for no one
Moving through the city and I just begun
Too many lames tryna do what I've done
Silk print loafers, I don't work for no one
Moving through the city!
Yung Lean, SBE, just begun

I got electricity running through my veins
I got everything, who am I to blame?
Stuck like the flowers in the rain
Smoking this dope, I think I'm going insane
Moving through the city
With my keys in the snow
Time running through my hands
I have to let it go, have to let it go
In the shadows of the city, in my mind
Nothing matters anymore, it's just a matter of time
Till we fall back and meet again, feed my needs again
Posted with my friends, I resurrect to rise again

I got electricity running through my veins

Smoking this dope, I think I'm going insane

I have to let it go, have to let it go
