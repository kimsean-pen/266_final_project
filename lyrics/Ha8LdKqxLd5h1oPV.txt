Standing over the basin
Ive been washing my face in
Jet black mascara racing
Down my cheeks till I taste it
Staring at my reflection
Every slight imperfection
Staring back at me
Naked as a girl can be

And who would have thought
that I'd be so content in my own skin

Right now the whole world could call me ugly
So what, to you I'm not
You don't love me cause I'm beautiful
Oh no
I'm beautiful cause you love me

I cant tell you the deepest and darkest of my secrets
Knowing that you will keep it
And it wont change our feeling
Every mark on my body
You know every inch of me
All the parts that I used to hate to glorified
Theres a new meaning to freedom when I'm with you

Right now the whole world could call me ugly
So what, to you I'm not
You don't love me cause I'm beautiful
Oh no
I'm beautiful cause you love me

Beautiful cause you love me

Theres a new meaning to freedom when I'm with you

Right now the whole world could call me ugly
So what, to you I'm not
You don't love me cause I'm beautiful
Oh no
I'm beautiful cause you love me

Beautiful cause you love me
