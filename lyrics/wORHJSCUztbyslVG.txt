You can stop your crying
I'm never coming back
You can stop your crying
Just walk down the tracks again

I just can't take the pressure
It's all too much for me
I just can't take the pressure
So please just let me be
See, I've been breaking hearts for far too long
Loving you for far too long

Making plans now, for far too long
Yes, I've been breaking hearts for far too long
Loving you for far too long
It's time I left

It's time I'm moving on
I'm gonna find a city
Call the streets my home
I'm gonna find a city
Drink until it's gone
The girls there look so pretty

Treat me, oh, so well
And girls there look so pretty
They're all just empty shells to me
See, I've been breaking hearts for far too long

Loving you for far too long
Making plans now for far too long
Yes, I've been breaking hearts for far too long
Loving you for far too long
It's time I left, it's time I'm moving on
When I need the shelter I'll know just who to call
When I need the shelter be knocking on your door
And when it comes to dying, I'll do it on my own
I've never been too clever, I've always just hung on
See, I've been breaking hearts for far too long
Loving you for far too long
Making plans now for far too long
Yes, I've been breaking hearts for far too long
Loving you for far too long
It's time I left, it's time I'm moving on
