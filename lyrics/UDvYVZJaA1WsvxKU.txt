A hunger unleashed
Annihilating black
Born of crippling doom
In oppressive silence masked

Their truth carves a void
A night that never ends
Starving for the dawn
Ravenous, from nightmares born

In monolithic forms
Dressed in the colours of the beast
Stone flood
Into the sinister dawn
Cloaked in dust
The columns wavering

Words like guillotines
Clawing at your solid walls
On your darkness they feed
Phrases cut like sharpened teeth

Phrases cut like sharpened teeth
Phrases cut like sharpened teeth

Born of crippling doom
In oppressive silence masked

In monolithic forms
Dressed in the colours of the beast
Stone flood
Into the sinister dawn
Cloaked in dust
The columns wavering blind

Dressed in the colours of the beast
