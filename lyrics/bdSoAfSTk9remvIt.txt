They swept across the land
They did not leave a thing
They did not leave a person
A stone or a tree
They did not leave anything
They did not leave anything
All it's left is sand
All it's left is sand

I remember, father
I remember him
Every minute I remember
Every moment
Now I hate everyone
Now I hate everyone
Before, I used to love
Before, I used to love
One day, thorns shall grow
One day, thorns shall grow
From their graves
When they return
Throns will grow
Over their graves
I will be waiting
And when they return
I will be waiting
I will not leave a person
Standing
I will not leave anything
I will not leave anything
All I'll leave is sand
All I'll leave is sand
And then thorns shall grow
And then thorns shall grow
From their graves
When they return
Throns shall grow
Over their graves
I will be waiting

When they return
Throns shall grow
Over their graves
I will be waiting
