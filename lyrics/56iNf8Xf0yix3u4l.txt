I can't expect you to see
me when i'm not around
and my voice is destroyed
by confinement of sound
i'm a human machine
laced with hidden disease
if the future looks bleak
then you're connected to me

flesh into gear
myself appears dissected and pretentious
a simple sound a heavy sigh
you'll win the whole world over
you'll live in fear of being someone that you didn't want to
i realize your insecurities will get the best of you

a traitor's embrace
how foolish how wrong
contained in one place
anxiety spawns
unopened reowned
what's needed upscaled
digested inhaled
unwilling unwound

flesh into gear
myself appears dissected and pretentious
a simple sound a heavy sigh
you'll win the whole world over
you'll live in fear of being someone that you didn't want to
i realize your insecurities will get the best of you

flesh into gear

a simple sound a heavy sigh
you'll win the whole world over
