There's a city on the ocean
It's where I'll go to die
Cause there's no room to be content
Not within this restless heart
I'll sleep better when I'm dead and bled it all out

There's my bride in the moonlight
The one I've yet to know
Those future vows that I intend
To keep when they are meant
When I am not a mess like this oh
I'm too young to fall in love I want it all now

Cause though it's perfect I couldn't stay here all year
In another life we could stay here right here
In another life
Or we could leave
In another I wouldn't leave
