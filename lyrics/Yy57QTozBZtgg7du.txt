Your name isn't proud demented man
Hold tight to the lie you sold to them
Take God and the case below
It falls on the day with much to learn

But you didn't get it
No you didn't get it
But you didn't get it
No you didn't

They're like cannibals full of grass stealing lives
And I swear I won't be found
See a door like advice, like a light
I'm getting out alive
I'm getting out alive

Could you tell I've been back too long
Fingers in the face
Kid you not,
Feel it go limp like a rag doll
Crushed
Never jealous
But the rage keeps a chance for the edge
This saint's about to roll

But you didn't get it
No you didn't get it
But you didn't get it
No you didn't

They're like cannibals full of grass stealing lives
And I swear I won't be found
See a door like advice, like a light
I'm getting out alive
I'm getting out alive

Getting out
Getting out
Getting out

They're like cannibals full of grass stealing lives
And I swear I've just been found
See a door like advice, like a light
Might not be getting out alive

They're like cannibals full of grass stealing lives
And I swear I've just been found
See a door like advice, like a light
Might not be getting out alive

Getting out
