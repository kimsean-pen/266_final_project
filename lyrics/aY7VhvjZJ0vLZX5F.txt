Well I wish that it would rain
Heavy rain down from the sky
Maybe then you wouldn't see the teardrops in my eyes
Well I wish that it would rain
It would be a great disguise
Maybe then you wouldn't see the teardrops in my eyes
And all of the raindrops that fall down on my face
Erase all the memories of you and your embrace
I'll long for the moment that I lose this bitter taste
And I don't want you to see me this way

Well I wish that it would rain
Heavy rain down from the sky
Oooh maybe then I wouldn't see you walking right on by
Well I wish that it would rain
Let it storm just for awhile
Oohh yeah maybe then you wouldn't see this sadness in my smile
Ooh noo and all of the raindrops that fall down on my face
Erase all the memories of you and your embrace
I'll long for the moment that I lose this bitter taste
And I don't want you to see me this way

Rain down rain down
Rain down rain down
Rain down rain down on me
Rain down rain down
Rain down rain down
Rain down rain down on me
