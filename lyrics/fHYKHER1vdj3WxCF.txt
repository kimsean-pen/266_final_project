I'm not awake yet, I haven't opened my eyes.
But I haven't been late yet, I'm gonna to be on time.
For today's the day that you are coming back.
And I can't wait to see you materialize.

How much can I take now before I break inside?
How long will it take now before I realize,
That I can't live without you by my side,
And nothing else will keep me satisfied?

I've looked at my heart now and I trusted my eyes.

I made that mistake now ain't gonna make it twice.
But time can put the man on the other side.
And I can't wait to see what's left behind.

I'm not awake yet, I haven't opened my eyes.
I haven't been late yet.
Gonna be on time, gonna be on time,
gonna be on, gonna be on time.
But today's the day that you are coming back,
And I can't wait to see you materialize.
