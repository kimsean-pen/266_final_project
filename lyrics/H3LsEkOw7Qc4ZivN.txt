If there's one thing that I can't explain
Is why the world has to have so much pain
With all the ways of communicating
We can't get in touch with who we're hating

Who we're hating

No, We can't get in touch with who we're hating
So turn on, turn on, turn on the news,
turn on, turn on, turn on the news
I hear it every day on the radio
Somebody shoots a guy he don't even know
Airplanes falling out of the sky
A baby is born and another one dies
Highways fill with refugees now

Doctors finding out about disease
With all this uptight pushing and shoving
That keeps us away from who we're loving
who we're loving
keeps us away from who we should be loving
So turn on, turn on, turn on the news
turn on, turn on, turn on the news
turn on, turn on, turn on the news

So turn on, turn on, turn on the news
turn on, turn on, turn on the news
turn on, turn on, turn on the news
you got to turn it on
you got to turn it on
turn it on
turn it on
turn it on
turn it on
turn it on
