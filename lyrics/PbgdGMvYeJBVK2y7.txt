Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo

I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high I touched the clouds
Whoa-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh
Whoa-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh

I stretched my hands out to the sky
We dance with monsters through the night
Whoa-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh
Whoa-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh

I'm never gonna look back, whoa
I never gonna give it up, no
Please don't wake me now (1, 2, 3, 4)

Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo
This is gonna be the best day of my life (Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo)
My li-i-i-i-i-ii-fe

Wooh-woo-hu-hu-wo
This is gonna be the best day of my life (Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo)
My li-i-i-i-i-ii-fe

Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo
Wooh
Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo

I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Whoa-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh
Whoa-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh

But all the possibilities
No limits, just epiphanies
Whoa-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh
Whoa-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh

I'm never gonna look back, whoa
I never gonna give it up, no
Just don't wake me now

Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo
This is gonna be the best day of my life (Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo)
My li-i-i-i-i-ii-fe

Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo
This is gonna be the best day of my life (Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo)
My li-i-i-i-i-ii-fe

Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo
Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo

I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul (Soul)
The stars were burning so bright, the sun was out 'till midnight
I say we lose control (Control)

Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo

Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo
This is gonna be the best day of my life (Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo)
My li-i-i-i-i-ii-fe

Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo
This is gonna be the best day of my life (Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo)
My li-i-i-i-i-ii-fe

This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gotta be
The best day of my life
Everything is looking up, everybody up now

Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo
This is gonna be the best day of my life (Wooh-woo-hu-hu-uh-wo)
My li-i-i-i-i-ii-fe
