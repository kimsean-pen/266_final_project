Thinking what should I do
Now I don't have you
Facing my demotion
I'm just a fish in your ocean
Has been, that's what I am
With my backstage wristband
Freaking seconds of you
That's not what I'm used to

Feed, feed 'em all to me
Careful with my stuff
What's your policy
First one's free

I save 'em up, I put 'em in my pocket
I save 'em up, put 'em in a jar
I save 'em up, I'm gonna need 'em for later
I save 'em up, then they'll go real far

Hand me downs, the takedowns
I take the leftovers
Cold ones and the old ones
Better than no ones

Feed, feed 'em all to me
Careful with my stuff
What's your policy
First one's free

I save 'em up, I put 'em in my pocket
I save 'em up, put 'em in a jar
I save 'em up, I need 'em for later
I save 'em up, then they'll go real far

I time it out, gotta be real careful
I time it out, get 'em right on time
I time it out, I get 'em when I need 'em
Time is up, what's left is over

It's over
I can never have enough
Oh, I can never have enough
I sure am greedy
Hand 'em over to me

Nothing's free

I save 'em up, I put 'em in my pocket
I save 'em up, put 'em in a jar
I save 'em up, gonna need 'em for later
I save 'em up, then they'll go real far

I time it out, I'll be real careful
I time it out, get 'em right on time
I time it out, I get 'em when I need 'em
Time is up, what's left is over

Oh, I need 'em,
Yeah, I need 'em
Because I need 'em
Time is up, what's left is over
I time it out, I time it out
Because I need 'em, I really need 'em

What should I do, now I don't have you?
I really need 'em, I really need 'em
Hand me downs, the takedowns
I take the leftovers
