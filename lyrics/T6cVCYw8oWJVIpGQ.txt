Thoughts fall company and dreams as friends
I'm only half here
And other half pretends
That I'm just
I'm just a bad haircut
Some fashion from last week
No one really knows me at all
But sometimes I like
Living in my own world
Disconnected and so naive

Perfectly out of key

I'm not allowed to be anyone else
But me
So I try to take apart my head from time to time
And I'm not resolute so when I
Need help well I would ask you
And I would try to be polite
And sometimes I like living in my own world
Disconnected and so naive

I'm perfectly out of key

And sometimes I like living in my own world
Disconnected and so naive
But the truth is I
I hate the truth

And I would rather live and die in fantasy
