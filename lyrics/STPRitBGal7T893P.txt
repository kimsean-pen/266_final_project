I guess I'm a loony, I guess I'm on one
Guess I'm just a star of my movie
They say I'm the chosen and so it goes
I'm supposed to live and grow old and die alone
Talking to myself in the mirror
Take one to know one
Can we talk? Just loony to loony?
How strange the notion
You don't really know no one
And what if I told you
You no longer know me
You better keep going keep on rolling now
Ain't no thing you don't really need me
The pressure is growing
Hard times they mold ya
In summer we colder
Let the world see how you win
No matter how you seem to them
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em

And people think I'm mad or on one
Won't you tell them I'm mad solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
And people think I'm mad or on one
Won't you tell them I'm mad solar
M.A.D S.O.L.A.R

And people think I'm mad or on one
Won't you tell them I'm mad solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
And people think I'm mad or on one
Won't you tell them I'm mad solar
M.A.D S.O.L.A.R

I guess I'm looney, I guess I'm on one
Guess I gotta finish my movie
See my heart has been swollen, it's healin' slow
Hope I dont live to grow old no one at home
Starin at myself in the mirror they want to know one
Wanna find out about the real me
Soon moments reveal you
Especially friends who were never good friends
But wanna act like they know me
You better keep going keep strollin'
Its so crazy how you think you can play me
Show them pussies you're growin'
Hard times they mold ya
Tell the haters 'I told ya'
Let the world see how you win
No matter how you seem to them
Fuck 'em

And people think I'm mad or on one
Won't you tell them I'm mad solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
And people think I'm mad or on one
Won't you tell them I'm mad solar
M.A.D S.O.L.A.R

And people think I'm mad or on one
