I'll drop and speak a charm,
take the weather from your heart,
and the weight from on your toes,
And theres nothing to your side,
for you to recognise,
it tarnished long ago,

The lake will overflow,
flood all i've ever known,
break walls and sever bones,
Now i'l hold it in my heart,
just for you to fall apart,
Stunt all we'd ever grown,

Burn the bed and the dreams i've never met,
those wishes were never for granted,
So burn the bed i'l face wind and fill my head,
those wishes were never for granted

you'l drop for a new charm,
put the thunder in my arms,
hope for them to close,
leave nothing to my side,
take all I recognise
and varnish your old blows.

Burn the bed and the dreams i've never met,
those wishes were never for granted,
So burn the bed i'l face wind and fill my head,
those wishes were never for granted
