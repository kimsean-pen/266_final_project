Someone to watch over me
I couldn't ask you for more
Why do I long to be free,
But cry when you walk out the door?

You got me goin' round like a record now
I wanna show my love but I don't know how
I know that I'm a mess but I pray you'll stick around

Take me to your downtown rivers
And your dried-out cities
I could compromise my rhythm
So we both go slow

Take me to your tree tops, growing up,
In your dried-out cities
If you get my heart it will never stop
But we'll both go slow

Lovers get lost in the sky
Gone in a blink of an eye
Let's make our own legacy
Chiseled in stone we will be

You got me goin' round like a record playin'
It's comin' over me like a sudden wave
I know that I'm a mess but I hope that you will stay

Take me to your downtown rivers
And your dried-out cities
I could compromise my rhythm
So we both go slow

Take me to your tree tops, growing up,
In your dried-out cities
If you get my heart it will never stop
But we'll both go slow

Take me to your downtown rivers
Turn me to a sea of shivers
Everything I see is clearer when the lights are low

Take me to your dried-out cities
Everything you see is pretty
I could see it all through your eyes
Like they're my own

Take me to your downtown rivers
And your dried-out cities
I could compromise my rhythm
So we both go slow

Take me to your tree tops, growing up,
In your dried-out cities
If you get my heart it will never stop
But we'll both go slow
