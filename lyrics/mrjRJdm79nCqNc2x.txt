Supersonic from the Earth to the sun now
Flash from your atomic gun wow
Hang a right at the next Zodiac sign
Your kiss mine

Our love is radiating
Chill out, it's worth the waiting
You've got me spinning like a satellite

I'm in orbit, we're in heaven
Countdown is a quarter to seven
Faster than the stars shooting by

Bridge:
Venus collides with Mars
Romance written in the stars

Chorus:
Supersonic from the Earth to the sun now
Flash from your atomic gun now
Hang a right at the next Zodiac sign
Your kiss is mine
Kiss so divine
My supersonic baby
Your kiss is mine
Kiss so divine
My supersonic lover, baby

Supersonic, I'm at the controls now
The course I take is gonna be bold

I've got you covered, covered like lotion
We move together, perpetual motion

All the planets are in alignment
Venus rising, that's the assignment
The love phase is emerging
Signs show harmonic converging

Bridge

Chorus

Zoom baby your signal is clearer
Flashing lights are getting nearer
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

Supersonic from the edge of the sun now
Flash - from your atomic gun now
And arrive at the next Zodiac sing
And arrive at the next Zodiac sing
Supersonic from the edge of the sun
My supersonic baby
Flash - from your atomic gun
My supersonic baby
Your kiss is mine
Kiss so divine
My supersonic baby
Your kiss is mine
Kiss so divine
My supersonic lover baby
