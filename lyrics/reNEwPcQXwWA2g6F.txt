You turn on the light
Then you turn it back off
'Cause sleepin' alone, yeah it ain't what you thought
It's the drip of the sink
It's the click of the clock
And you're wonderin' if I'm sleepin'

You heard from your friends
That I'm doin' okay
And you're thinkin', maybe you made a mistake
And you want me to know
But I don't wanna know
How you're feelin'

Keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk
And it's late
And you're missin' me like hell
Keep it to yourself

If you see me out and I'm standin' alone
Well it don't mean that I'm gonna need a ride home
If you walk up to me like it ain't what it is
I know that it ain't gonna end with a kiss

Keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're lookin' for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk
And it's late
And you're missin' me like hell
Keep it to yourself
Yea keep it to yourself

Yea, when you're drunk
And it's late
And you're sad
And you hate goin' home alone
'Cause you're missin' me like hell
Keep it to yourself
Mmm yea keep it to yourself

Mmm
