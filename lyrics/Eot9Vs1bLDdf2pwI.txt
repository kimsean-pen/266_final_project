I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you

I didn't mean all the shit I say
But it's better than what's going on in my head
How dare you bring another chick in my bed
You lucky I'm doing my yoga or you might be dead
I ain't doing nothing that would take away my zen
If you are not enchanting then you park it up and then
Life's a bunch of texts and we're doin' our best

Searching for something outside ourselves to bring us happiness, yes

I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you

It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you

You and I dont know

What goes on for us
If we lead the stars
We both know what's the life for us

I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
Too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you
But I forget you
