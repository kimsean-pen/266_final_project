This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak

God help me, I've fallen away
The leaves are dancing on my grave
Streets are sounding low, we are ready now
that our world has turned too slowly

As sad as it sounds, will I miss them when I'm underground?
Hey son, it's okay, I'm on my way to a better place

The walls are shaking
The Earth is breaking
Breaking apart while you're grieving
This distance between us it always defeats us
(It always defeats us, it always defeats us!)

Our hearts start to bleed as our eyes they become wells
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
Our tears become rivers swimming in our own private hell
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak

It's happened again
Wave goodbye to all my friends
I can't believe that my past always comes back to haunt me

It always haunts me
It always haunts me

How can you blame me? They just watch as my box is buried!

The walls are shaking
The Earth is breaking
Breaking apart while you're grieving
This distance between us, it always defeats us
(It always defeats us, it always defeats us!)

Our hearts start to bleed as our eyes they become wells
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
Our tears become rivers swimming in our own private hell
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak

Our hearts start to bleed as our eyes they become wells
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
Our tears become rivers swimming in our own private hell
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak

All the hearts that are breaking
All the memories fading
All the drugs they are taking
All the drinks to erase me

All the hearts that are breaking
All the memories fading
All the drugs they are taking
All the drinks to erase me

This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak

Our hearts start to bleed as our eyes they become wells
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
Our tears become rivers swimming in our own private hell
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak

Our hearts start to bleed as our eyes they become wells
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
Our tears become rivers swimming in our own private hell
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
