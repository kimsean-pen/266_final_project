Waves are breaking in a storm
Tornado sweep me off the floor
See only darker skies in sight
You wanna know what's that like
Like a thousand needles in my heart
Whenever time sets us apart
And now my world is crashing down
Now that I can't have you around
Oh why you wanna break away
I'm bleeding
I can see you now in shades of grey
A memory fading
Oh why you wanna break away
I'm bleeding
I can see you now in shades of grey
A memory fading
Running fast in hell in rain
The summer tell me I'm insane
Throw a reason out the door
Won't make a difference no more
A thousand needles in my heart
Show me the painful from the start
You're wasted, not packing our day
The day before you walked away
Oh why you wanna break away
I'm bleeding
I can see you now in shades of grey
A memory fading
Oh why you wanna break away
I'm bleeding
I can see you now in shades of grey
A memory fading
(A thousand needles in my heart)
(A thousand needles in my heart)
(A thousand needles in my heart)
Oh why you wanna break away
I'm bleeding
I can see you now in shades of grey
A memory fading
I can see you wanna break away
I'm bleeding
I can see you now in shades of grey
A memory fading
