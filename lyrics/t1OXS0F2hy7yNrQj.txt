Rachel
You don't know what you're doing to me
This little madness
Creeping up at the back of my neck
If you could feel
How your every little move goes right through me
I still got the traces of seeing that way he touched your face

If love's not all you want, that's alright
Just give me those moments when you look aside
A few drinks
But don't think
I can't see it straight
Through the cheap wine and champagne

Come home with me Rachel
You got so much more than he thinks about
Come home with me Rachel
I got no one else that I care about

Angel
I know there is things that you'll never say
We both got our histories
There's nothing you need to tell me
But if I'm wrong
About the guy who wouldn't look me straight in the eye
Let's just walk out now
Get ourselves on some safer ground

If love's not all you want, that's alright
Just give me those moments when you look aside
A few drinks
But don't think
I can't see it straight
It's just cheap wine and champagne

Come home with me Rachel
You got so much more than he thinks about
Come home with me Rachel
I got no one else that I care about

Spend all night
Hanging around
But you know these people are spinning me out

Come home with me Rachel
You got so much more than he thinks about
Come home with me Rachel
I got no one else that I care about
