When you're trapped in your doubt and anger
And you're wailing along
Like you relish the fail

When your life turns to be deception
And you're scratching the walls on your cell
Each step requires mad devotion

Mindfall Remedy
No one else will catch you
Only you possess the key
Mindfall remedy

All those rules were dissembling a future
And you feel like you burn in emotional hell

With the absence of love and compassion
Every stone is a mountain high
Each step requires mad devotion

Mindfall Remedy
No one else will catch you
Only you possess the key
Mindfall remedy

I feel my tower crumbling
With my resistance low
I'm living in a vacuum
I'm falling to the core

In the core of resistance
To face my inner self
Lies the key to my existence
To help myself

Mindfall Remedy
No one else will catch you
Only you possess the key
Mindfall remedy

Mindfall Remedy
No one else will catch you
Only you possess the key
Mindfall remedy
