With the truth
Only suffering can change me

One last breath
From the bottom
Who will be in line to save me?

Face to face
With the truth
On this night I will break free

One last breath
From the bottom
Who's extending their hand?
Who is reaching for me?

Face to face
With the truth
Only suffering can change me

One last breath
From the bottom
Who will be in line to save me?

Don't say a word just wait for the white light
You have to give them what they want
A pound of flesh
That was never lent

Everyone take your seat
The show is about to begin

Stare down with death
A broken back and a voice in my head
Barking commands
Forcing my hand
They got me grinding my teeth until they fall out
At my feet

Welcome the world to who I am
Cursed from birth with my heart in my hands

(One man freak show)
(Come one come all)
Pull the curtain back
Let them see what they paid for
A man that is done for
Eyes afire while licking their teeth
Tonight I am the feast

I was born with a heart too big
And a soul that is not for sale
In this putrid world
Something so rare

One man freak show
Come one come all

Face to face
With the truth
Only suffering can change me

One last breath
From the bottom
Who will be in line to save me?

Pound of flesh
