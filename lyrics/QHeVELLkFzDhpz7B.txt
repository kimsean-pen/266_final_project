All along I had to talk about it
But like a two edged sword, It cuts you and it stabs me
All along, I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask and you control your world

You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth, but that's your hiding place
You say you love me, but it's hard to see
'cause when he's in your arms you're throwing rocks at me

Who do you love?
Is it me, with you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want ya
if you can't answer
but you know me

(There is nothing in your eyes)
There is nothing in your eyes
(But that's the way you cry)
But that's the way you cry girl
(Cry girl)
(All is grand, all is bright)
All is grand, all is bright
(You're just studying my mind)

I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
When I come to you, you're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask, so I can se your face

Who do you love?
Is it me, with you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want ya
if you can't answer
I know you

(Heaven must be wary)
Heaven must be wary
(Your smile is scary)
You got me spinnin', girl
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, yours are good
(Where's your soul? Where'd it go?)
You got me scared, girl
(Heaven must be wary)
Heaven must be wary
(Your smile is scary)
You know where you've been
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, na na na
(Where's your soul? Where did it go?)

I walk around suffering in my doom
When I come to you, you're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask so I can see your face

Who do you love?
Is it me, with You?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want ya
if you can't answer
I know you

Who do you love?
Is it me, with You?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want ya
if you can't answer
I know

I don't wanna talk about it
(Let's talk about it)
I don't wanna talk about it
(Let's talk about it)
I don't wanna talk about it
(Let's talk about it)
