Discemus gubernaculum esse movendum
Quod verum Putaveram esse particulam
Pro viribus agendum est
Vim totam adhibebimus
Ad haec nos paremus

Our brave soul is crying
Our soul is lost
Our brave soul is dying
Our soul is lost
We challenge illusions
Created by us all

Cube the Sphere
Wipe all the dust from your eyes
Burn your lies
Dare to trash your own paradise
Doubt your eyes

We challenge illusions
Created by us all

Learn to trust your senses deep within
And see with all the beauty of your soul
Shine down all your precious light on me
I'll wake you in reality again

Be free of fear
Open your heart, make a whole new start
Free from the past
Your future is convertible
Now embrace the holographic principle

Only you is what you'll be
All you are is what you see
On the other side it's me
If you turn around
You'll see I am here
Only you is what you'll be
Now break out and we'll be free
Leave dubiety behind and dive into eternal light

Merge with all the energy around
Immerse yourself in seas of utile wishes
Do not try to judge your universe
Let purity reverse your sacred curse

Be free of fear
Open your heart, make a whole new start
Free from the past
Your demons seem invincible
Now embrace the holographic principle

Only you is what you'll be
All you are is what you see
On the other side it's me
If you turn around
You'll see I am here
Only you is what you'll be
Now break out and we'll be free
Leave dubiety behind and dive into eternal light

You become what you focus on
Don't shift the blame to the world
It will raise vexation
It can cause your defeat and our defeat

Run from illusions
Reality is a choice
Be sure to choose well
Run from delusions
Go to the root, find out who you are

You become what you're aiming at
Don't shift the blame to the world
It will raise resentment
Check your ego, lose your hologram

Your illusions
Feed your eyes
This deception
Writes your life
Your truth's a lie

Watch for illusions
Rapacity, an empty shell
That suits no one well
Watch for delusions
Let life just rain all it's sparks on you

Venemun invasit sanguinem et venas
Iniectum damnosis cogitates tuis
Non morbum transferunt in te res humanae
Sed pavor internus te infirmat prorsus

Your illusion
Lies in ruins
This deception
Won't survive
Take back control

Discemus guber
Naculum esse movendum
Ad haec nos paremus tota vi
Discemus gubernaculum esse movendum
Quod verum putaveram esse particulam
Pro vibirus agendum est
Vim totam adhibebimus
