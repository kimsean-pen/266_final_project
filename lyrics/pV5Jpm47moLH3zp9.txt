They took you on they thought they made you feel safe
I watched it all I'll never be the same again
All this all we seem the same
They left you falling and no one remembers your name
And now they're gone and the flies they record you die
All this all we seem the same

I dig you in I tried to pull you away
I can't forget that these arms they tried in vain

I'll take you with me as I'm falling inside
I'll take you with me as I'm falling inside
I fall apart but it ever beckons
I'll take you with me as I'm falling inside
I'll take you with me as I'm falling inside
I fall apart but it ever beckons

I'll take to throwing all the pennies I stole
I'll throw them well and get a wish now it's time for all
For pinching thumbs to help revive me
These pinching thumbs will lift you from the enemy
And when the dust settles and we raise once more

I'll take you with me as I'm falling inside
I'll take you with me as I'm falling inside
I fall apart but it ever beckons
I'll take you with me as I'm falling inside
I'll take you with me as I'm falling inside
I fall apart but it ever beckons

That lets the drips in your eyes turn to walls and the

(It will spill while you die)?
(It will spill when you can lie down)?
(It's fallen apart baby)?
It will spill while you die)?
(It will spill when you can lie down)?
(The sun is... down)?

I dig you in I tried to pull you away
Another one and the flies they record you die
