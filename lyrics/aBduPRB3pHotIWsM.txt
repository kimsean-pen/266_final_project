You've got to believe (believe)
You've got to believe (believe)
We've tried it all, tried everything but giving in
I refuse to throw all that we have away
I still recall, I still remember better days
The endless search comes on alive for I've regained

We can make a different here!
Just close your eyes and take this hand my dear
Just hold your breath and let me dry your tears
All you've got to do is believe

All you've got to do is believe, believe (believe)
All you've got to do is believe

The life you can't understand you just have to reach out and grab it, reach out and grab it
How could you send us somewhere waiting to come home? (to come home)

We can make a different here!
Just close your eyes and this hand my dear
Just hold your breath and let me dry your tears
All you've got to do is believe

You don't have to cry another tear for me
I'll bleed until we take rejoice, hand in hand
Will you believe in me? Will you believe in me? Will you believe.?

We can make a different here!
Just close your eyes and take this hand my dear
Just hold your breath and let me dry your tears
All you've got to do is believe

We can make a different here!
Just close your eyes and take this hand my dear
Just hold your breath and let me dry your tears
All you've got to do is believe
You've got to believe
You've got to believe
You've got to believe
You've got to believe
You've got to believe
