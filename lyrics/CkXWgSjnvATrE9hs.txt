Obsession

I could wait night and day, sigh your name when I pray
In my heart night and day till you come my way
I could wait night and day be the sky blue or gray
In my heart night and day for your love to stay

Obsession

You got that magic in your eyes shining wherever you go
To a lover's paradise, trust every sign when I'm so
Close to where my heart belongs like in heaven

I could wait night and day, sigh your name when I pray
In my heart night and day till you come my way
I could wait night and day be the sky blue or grey
In my heart night and day for your love to stay

Obsession

I can't help falling into a trance, losing my senses I know
You're my hero in advance, trust every sign when I'm so
Close to where my heart belongs like in heaven

I could wait night and day, sigh your name when I pray
In my heart night and day till you come my way
I could wait night and day be the sky blue or grey
In my heart night and day for your love to stay

Obsession
Obsession
Obsession

There ain't no promises, ain't no commitments
But how cruel can love be, how cruel to a broken heart like mine
There ain't no right, there ain't no wrong
But as long as hope survives, I'll stay alive

I could wait night and day, sigh your name when I pray
In my heart night and day till you come my way
I could wait night and day be the sky blue or grey
In my heart night and day for your love to stay
