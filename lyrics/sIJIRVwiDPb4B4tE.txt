Luster so sheen it pulls you in frets on the harpoons
it moves it moves around you
Sickle the cells of our pains grow in deeper the stains of our youth
our youth imbued
Grass comes in through the tongues of the sorry words we sprung on you
on you it fuels

And it surrounds everything
And it surrounds all your dreams
and it will take you to fears you never knew

Running sycophants all our limbs attaches us on
as if we have no use no use to let it refuse
Pick up the wires of our sins filter them into our begnin truths it fools it fumbles in tune

And it surrounds everything
And it surrounds all your dreams
and it will take you to
fears you never knew

And it settles in, settles in
till you forget everything
and it white wash
into your skin
And you won't remember none
