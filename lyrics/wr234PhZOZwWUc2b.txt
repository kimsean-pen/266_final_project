I wish air clouds could hold me up
Like I thought as a child, growing up
I wish I could sound
Soothing as the rainfall
But I am only, a drop from the storm

Feel like a tourist out in the country
Once this whole world was all countryside
Feel like a tourist in the big city
Soon I will simply evaporate

The streams up north
The drums down south
They take across afganistan
A long time ago
You're shuffling your feet into the next dimension
Soon skyscrapers, will be everywhere

I feel like a tourist lost in the suburbs
Soon our whole world will be up in sprawl
Feel like a lover along the ocean
Feel like a teardrop streaming off your chin

Some will bet against you
Try even to prevent you
But not many can stop you man
If you got a perfect plan

Can they possibly try
Demand to know why
They would bow to you
In this sad thousand generations

Feel like a tourist out in the desert
Somehow it feels like the devil's breath
Feel like a tourist out in this swampland
This world is just of water and land

Everywhere I go are the tourists
But if you stay with me I'll always be around
