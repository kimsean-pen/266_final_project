Feel like I've been walking forever
Waiting just to fall down a hole
I've been getting so jealous of Alice
And all the places that she got to go
Is it enough to pretend anymore?
Alice, did you see it was coming?
Did you feel it somewhere inside your bones?
Oh, the pull of the earth when you're runnin'
Like a mother that's calling you home
Is it enough to pretend anymore?

But if I should go there now
I don't think I'll come back again
Oh, if I should go there now
Don't know how I'll get back again
I fall away like dust
I fall away like dust

Feel like I've been sleeping forever
Slipping in and out 'til I'm gone
I've been wishing I was lost with Lucy
I've been trying to find the place I'm from
It isn't enough to pretend anymore
It isn't enough to pretend anymore

But if I should go there now
I don't think I'll come back again
Oh, if I should go there now
Don't know how I'll get back again
I fall away like dust
I fall away like dust
Ooh...
Ooh...

But if I should go there now
I don't think I'll come back again
Oh, if I should go there now
Don't know how I'll get back again
I fall away like dust
I fall away like dust

I fall
I fall away like dust
