They're moving earth outside
The ground is shaking like a beat (no beat)?
a dense terrible sound
at once both teeming and asleep
It seems to me to be a sign
I don't believe in such a myth
It seems to me to keep one eye on the situation's best.

It's good to see you,
it's good to see you go.

It's good to see you,
it's good to see you go.

It's really not that kind
To terrorize one in one's sleep
And if you really tried, you'd probably cut the cheese to deep.
It seems to me that that's a fine way to keep you off your feet.
there seems to be no other side for the two ideas to meet.

It's good to see you,
it's good to see you go.
It's good to see you, Got to keep your mind on somewhere else.
It's good to see you go. Got to keep on thinking of your health

It's good to see you, Strange when your mind burns...

It's good to see you go. Strange when your mind burns...

Oh no, I hit rock bottom.
Oh no, I hit rock bottom.

It's good to see you,
It's good to see you, Got to keep your mind on somewhere else.
It's good to see you. Got to keep on thinking of your health

It's good to see you, Strange when your mind burns...
It's good to see you, Strange when your mind burns...
It's good to see you, Strange when your mind burns...
