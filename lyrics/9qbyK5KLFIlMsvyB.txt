Face them
The time will erase them
Stop trying to chase them
I've taken my place
And it's not worth the tears

I waited so long for this love
As another was slipping away
I waited so long for this moment
As the others were wasted
Cast a shade to save your eyes
Take this time to turn and say goodbye

Frozen
The words go unspoken
New victims are chosen
My heart may be broken
But so will my fear

I waited so long for this love
As another was slipping away
I waited so long for this moment
As the others were wasted
Cast a shade to save your eyes
Take this time to turn and say goodbye
