Don't be sad
I just wannna see you get through
All I have
It's yours if you think it helps you

Good or bad
There's no one can really judge you
You just have
To come to your own conclusion

There is only one
Who means more than all to me
And through the lady
In a dream I've learned to live with everyone

Mother, father
All my friends have seen me havin' my day
But now I find that
There's no need in trying to run though it's been fun

Don't be sad
I just wanna see you get through
All I have
It's yours if you think it helps you

Good or bad
There's no one can really judge you
You just have
To come to your own conclusion
