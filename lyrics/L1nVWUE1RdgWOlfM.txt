There's a twisting in your senses
There's a river in your blood
And the crows land on the fences
There's a daughter in the flood

Can you see, do you know?
Can you see, do you know?

Even with ease on the darkest breeze
Tonight's the night
And come to me sweet and slow my dear
Tonight's the night

And the moon is just a sliver
Hear the rushing make its sound
And you wish to be delivered
Oh to be no longer bound

Can you see, do you know?
Can you see, do you know?

Even with ease on the darkest breeze
Tonight's the night
Come to me sweet and slow my dear
Tonight's the night

It's all in your head least
That's what you said
Tonight's the night
Sing to me sweet and slow
Tonight, tonight, tonight
