Oh, Pamela, what did you do?
You touched the ground and
I fell in love with you
Oh, Pamela, what did they say?
I reached for your hand but
You turned and walked away

And can you lend your ears
To hear about my mate Pamela
So naughty but she loves her fella
One wink and a glint in the other one
At night she only wears Yves Saint Laurent
Watches black and white movies to get thin
She curls her hair just like Marilyn
Oh, what an enigmatic woman
My gosh do some mothers have 'em

Oh, Pamela, what did you do?
You touched the ground and
I fell in love with you
Oh, Pamela, what did they say?
I reached for your hand but
You turned and walked away

And can you lend your ears
For a man in trouble?
She tripped me up and now I see double
I asked her what her life was missing
And if she'd like to go trout mask kissing
She said, "Go get high with the other ones"
I looked around, lights on but no one home
Oh, what an enigmatic woman
My gosh do some mothers have 'em

Oh, Pamela, what did you do?
You touched the ground and
I fell in love with you
Oh, Pamela, what did they say?
I reached for your hand but you
Turned and walked away
Oh, Pamela, what did you do?
You touched the ground and
I fell in love with you
Oh, Pamela, what did they say?
I reached for your hand but you
Turned and walked away
Walk away

Na, na, na na, na
Na, na, na na na na
Na, na, na na, na
Na, na, na na na na
Take it away

Earl grey and lemons in the morning
By noon her nurse comes calling
Limousine with a stretcher in the back
They strap her down when
She has a panic attack
God followed her down to the hospital
No visitors allowed on a bicycle
So I threw rocks up to the window
I cut the glass so she
Could feel the wind blow

Oh, Pamela, what did you do?
You touched the ground and
I fell in love with you
Oh, Pamela, what did they say?
I reached for your hand but
You turned and walked away

Oh, Pamela, what did you do?
You touched the ground and
I fell in love with you
Oh, Pamela, what did they say?
I reached for your hand but you
Turned and walked away
You walk away

Oh, Pamela
