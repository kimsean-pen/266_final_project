Something is wrong
With the sum of us
That I can't seem to erase
How can I be
The only one
Without a smile on my face

Well now, you're laughing out loud
At just the thought of being alive
And I was wondering
Could I just be you tonight

You show your pain
Like it really hurts
And I can't even
Start to feel mine

I'm standing in place
With my head first
And I shake, I shake
And I see your progress stretched out for miles
And miles

You're laughing out loud
At just the thought of being alive
And I was wondering
Could I just be you tonight

This is the sound that I make
These are the words I chose
Somehow the right thing to say
Just won't come out
Just won't come out

And you're laughing out loud
at the thought of being alive
And I was wondering
Could I just be you tonight

Yeah I was wondering
Could I just be you tonight

Na na na na...

I was wondering
And I was wondering...
Baby I ...I was wondering... I was wondering
Yeah
