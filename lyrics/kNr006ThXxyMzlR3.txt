There are reasons that I can't stay
Counted them all myself
But I will always keep awake, searching for how it felt
Cause all I want is to find myself in anyone
And I wonder if it'll ever come
It's easy as (?) given up
If this could stop, I don't think I'd want it to
I've built my life around watching everything you do
It still feels like you can hear me when I talk to you
You just don't respond
And all I want is to find myself in anyone
And I wonder if you're having fun
I wonder if you're having fun
And all I want is to find myself in anyone
And I wonder if you're having fun
In that empty space where we used to talk
