A world in cosmic solitude,
Farthest from what is called sun.
Beyond astrology and myth!
From star-crusted black voids,
Devouring throat of chaos.

Within constellations
Yet unknown,
Beyond the starlit
Rings of Saturnus!

Veneration of the lunar orb
Perpetual cycles of
Adoration
Veneration of the lunar orb
An ancient law not to perturb.

Across Cyclopean bridges...
Mesmerizing rivers of pitch.
Through endless caverns
Seamed with glowing lichen.

Veneration of the lunar orb
Perpetual cycles of
Adoration
Veneration of the lunar orb
An ancient law not to perturb.

Armed remnants
Of battles passed,
In thrall of a pale red moon
That orbits this
Gloomy world...
Solely lit by its eerie glow.

Swift slayers dwell in Yuggothian caves...
In sacrificial awe to their moon.
Total subjugation
Of the soul and the flesh
Draw the bladeâ€”
Kill for the Moon
