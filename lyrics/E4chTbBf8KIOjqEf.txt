headbands, and thick eyeliner, teenage romance with a vampire
funny girl is never the bride
feelings make me anxious so i keep them inside
it's a short line to normalcy kid
never did have braces guess i got nothing to fix
so i walk home and listen to music
too dumb to notice that i couldn't choose it

everything was lame when i was 17
so i'm trying to be that person that i could have been
no i can't complain with all the things i've seen
do you think that nothing lasts forever?

perfect curls and summer dresses
waking up at 7 making sure i'd impress him
passing tests with flying colors
spending time at home while friends were under the covers

everything was lame when i was 17
so i'm trying to be that person that i could have been
no i can't complain with all the things i've seen
do you think that nothing lasts forever?
you'd think that it will last forever

now i'm 23, still feel like a teen
