If they point at you
If you live in fear
If you hide the gloom
If you'fr upside down

If it eats you up
If it tears you down
If it's not enough
If they let you down

If you fear the dark
If it wears you down
If you run away
If they hunt you down

Let go of me
Take your light wave
From the dark sky
Over me
It's not important
Let go of me
We're completely
Out of order
Can't you see
It's not important

And if you breathe
And if you walk
Walk on
And don't look back
