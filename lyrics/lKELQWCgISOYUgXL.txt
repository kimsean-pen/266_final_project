I'm on my way, it's you I turn to
How many days have I to love you?
I got to say this is inside me
I've got to have someone to guide me
Hate it when you leave, hate it when you leave
Hate it when you're leaving me

You're everywhere I go
Even though you're miles away
But I see, see you face everyday
Ooh, and I love, I love it
It's a hard game you play
Hate it when you leave, hate it when you leave
Hate it when you're leaving me

It's killing me
No arms around me
Living this way, so underhanded
I gotta make you stay, I gonna habit
Hate it when you leave, hate it when you leave
Hate it when you're leaving me
