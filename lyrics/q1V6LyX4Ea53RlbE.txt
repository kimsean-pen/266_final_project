Come on come on
Um yeah
Oh... w-o-o... come on come on

I feel like I've been locked up tight for a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're licking your lips and blowing kisses my way but that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby baby baby

Oh... w-h-o-a...
My body's saying let's go (go)
Oh... w-h-o-a...
But my heart is saying no (no)

If you wanna be with me baby there's a price to pay

I'm a genie in a bottle

If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression

Gotta like what you do

Come come come on in let me out
Music's playing and the lights' down low It's one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racing at the speed of light but that don't mean it's gotta be tonight (yeah)
