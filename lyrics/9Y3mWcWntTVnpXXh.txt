Levitating round you go
Where you stop, I don't know
Floating away
Bending and breaking, you're floating away
The left one wants what the right one's got
And all my shit is piling up
Floating away
Bending and breaking, you're so far away and.

I'm alright
Someone said to keep the window cracked, just a bit
Let the world keep spinning on a string
And I'm on fire
Someone said to keep the shades all drawn
With an open heart
Let the world keep spinning on a string

Wading in your riverbed, dying in my selfishness
Sinking away
Bending and breaking you're sinking away
The left one wants what the right one's got
And all my shit is piling up
Sinking away
Bending and breaking, you're so far away

And I replied "I made mistakes. I want to die."
She asks why said "I don't know, it won't untie."

I'm alright
Someone said to keep the window cracked, just a bit
Let the world keep spinning on a string
And I'm on fire
Someone said to keep the shades all drawn
With an open heart
Let the world keep spinning on a string
