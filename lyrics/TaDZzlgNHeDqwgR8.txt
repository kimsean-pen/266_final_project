I'm broken, broken hearted
Since it started, it's been that way
And I always knew
I'd be the one to fall
Cause you were taking me higher
And I knew I could go, go

Yea, you stole my heart
Away
Oh, you took the love I gave and left me
Hollow as an empty shell
And I keep dancing
By myself
To make the hurt go away, the hurt go away
Oh, go away

Strangers wanna know my name
Move away
I'm an volcano and I'm about to blow you away
I wanna spin
I wanna cross-step
I wanna ride this party, it's a wild horse
I wanna go, go

Yea, you stole my heart
Away
Oh, you took the love I gave and left me
Hollow as an empty shell
And I keep dancing by myself
To make the hurt go away, the hurt go away
Ooooooh

And people ask me
How I'm doing
But I just pretend I cannot hear them
They're just strangers to me
So I keep dancing by myself
To make the hurt go away
The hurt go away
Ooooooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, you broke this love in two
You took our love

Well, you stole my heart
Away
Oh, you took the love I gave and left me
Hollow as an empty shell
And I keep dancing by myself
To make the hurt go away
The hurt go away
Ooooooh

Come back
Come back
Come back, baby
Come back
My love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love
You took my love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love
Come back, baby
Come back
