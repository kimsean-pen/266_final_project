Fool, your word means shit
My eyes, they wander

(Not alotta shit left to break inside the mind of acid whore)
(Swallowing your sister's nightstand might cover up the clogging pores)
(The sound of master blaster's tank weapon gun addon I believe)
(Every single little child can benefit from smoking weed)

You're filling your pockets with my bones
Filling your pockets.

(Slow plans, stuck in my bladder, turn yourself sideways)
(Slow plans, stuck in my bladder, turn yourself sideways)
(I don't know much about computers, but I know that you look like a child abuser)
(Slow plans, stuck in my bladder, turn yourself sideways)
(Slow plans, stuck in my bladder, turn yourself sideways)
(Sideways, sideways)

Move in, take what's not yours, take what I worked for
Slow down, stop me now, you're tearing apart my soul

(And lately we should be making me)
(The best type of record for wasting please)
(Amazing bark is getting dark)
(You know that I know can ride the arc)
(And lately we should be making me)
(The present elect is a burning tree)
(And you know that I know that I cant be me,)
(So I can be you and well you can be me.)

I'm aT.O.Y F.O.R you, on pleasure principle
We keep it on the down low 'cause public eyes are sensible
There ain't no outcome without illusion that I left you in the first place
Girl you know what we're doin', this is dirty sex
Back seats, over the tables, under the sheets
At the workplace, on the beach
In the hammock where I sleep
I know it's your birthday, but call me up at 3: 30
Damn, okay, where do you want to meet?

'Cause I know the lonely road it took to get there
Yeah I believed, I believed it at your lonely word
Well I knew the lonely road it took to get there
Yeah I believed, I believed it in your lost words
Well I know the only road it takes to get there
And I only feel it now because I've been there.
And I know the lonely road it takes to get there
And I only feel it now because I've been there

Stop me now, you're tearing apart my soul
Move in, take what's not yours, take what I worked for

(Lame, as well, as boring)
(Lame, as well, as boring)

(A thinly veiled guise elected for another new sound)
(Capitalize when you dumb it down)
(You defect and I'll be raging on top of my car)
(You defect and I'll be passed out, covered in tar)
(A thinly veiled guise elected for another new sound)
(Capitalize when you dumb it down)
(A thinly veiled guise elected for another new sound)
