This is it!

Breaking up or breaking through
Breaking something's all we can do
Shoot straight, travel far
Stone crazy's all we ever are

But I don't care for lies
And I won't tell you twice
Because when all else fails
Dead men tell no tales

Shooting up away and back
A bit of guts is all that you lack
Far behind the stable door
I know you've met that horse before

But I don't care for skag
And this sure ain't no blag
At the end of all tracks and trails
Dead men tell no tales, come on

You used to be my friend
But that friendship's coming to an end
My meaning must be clear
You know pity is all that you hear

'Cause if you're doing smack
You won't be coming back
I ain't the one to make you bail
Dead men tell no tales

Tell no tale
Tell no tales
Tell no tale
Tell no tales
