A mirage before the rain
Silence in the air
Your silhouette with the wreath in your hair

A strong love that keeps us near
No shackles on our feet
A feeling that is pure and simple and serene

Your whisper in my ear
My childhood is here
I've never been this happy before

I'm lying numb and quiet
looking at the door and curtains in our room
are colored by the dawn

A simple feeling with infinite pain
