Wanna love ya
Wanna bug ya
Wanna squeeze ya
Stupid girl

Wanna touch ya
Wanna take ya
Wanna shut ya
Stupid girl.

I can't take this
Born to break this.

She's going away
(She's going away)
What's wrong with my life today?
She's going away

(She's going away)
What's wrong with my life today?

Stupid girl, Stupid girl
I'm a loner
I'm a loser
I'm a winner
In my mind.
I'm a bad one

I'm a good one
I'm a sick one

With a smile.
I can't take this
Born to break this.
She's going away
(She's going away)
What's wrong with my life today?

She's going away
(She's going away)
What's wrong with my life today?
(What's wrong with my life today?)

She's going away
(She's going away)
What's wrong with my life today?
(acoustic break)
Stupid girl, Stupid girl
Stupid girl, Stupid girl

(whoa)
She's going away
(She's going away)
What's wrong with my life today?
She's going away
(She's going away)
What's wrong with my life today?
(What's wrong with my life today?)
She's going away
(She's going away)
What's wrong with my life today?
Stupid girl, Stupid girl
Stupid girl, Stupid girl
