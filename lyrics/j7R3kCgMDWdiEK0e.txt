It's safe to say I'm lonely now
A place called home
Is just a memory away
I know I've done this all before
A thousand silent voices
Begging me to stay

Apologies all left unsaid
Secrets better left unspoken
Dreams are slowly put to bed
Rumors stirred and reawoken

If I try to get away
How long until I'm free?
And if I don't come back here
Will you remember me?

It's safe to say there's nothing now
It's all so quiet but I

Can't forget the sound
A thousand voices call my name
A thousand hands that

Pull me back down to the ground
I turn away from what you are
Denying all that you have given
I find a place that's safe and far
In time all will be forgiven

If I try to get away
How long until I'm free?
And if I don't come back here
Will you remember me?
