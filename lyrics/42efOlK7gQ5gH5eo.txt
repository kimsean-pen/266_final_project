Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Don't tell me you don't know what love is
When you're old enough to know better
When you find strange hands in your sweater
When your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote
I'm a man with a mission in two or three editions

And I'm giving you a longing look
Every day, every day, every day, every day I write the book

Chapter One, we didn't really get along
Chapter Two, I think I fell in love with you
You said you'd stand by me in the middle of Chapter Three
But you were up to your old tricks in Chapters Four, Five and Six

And I'm giving you a longing look
Every day, every day, every day, every day I write the book

The way you walk
The way you talk and try to kiss me and laugh
In four or five paragraphs
All your compliments and your cutting remarks
Are captured here in my quotation marks

And I'm giving you a longing look
Every day, every day, every day, every day I write the book
Ooh-hoo
Every day I write the book

Don't tell me you don't know the difference
Between a lover and a fighter
With my pen and my electric typewriter
Even in a perfect world where everyone was equal
I'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel

And I'm giving you a longing look
Every day, every day, every day, every day I write the book
Every day, every day, every day I write the book
Every day, every day, every day I write the book
Ooh-hoo, yeah

Every day, every day, every day, every day I write the book
I'm giving you a longing look
And every day, every day I write the book
Every day I write the book

I'm giving you a longing look
Every day I write the book

I'm giving you a longing look
And every day, every day, every day I write the book

I'm giving you a longing look
Every day I write the book

I'm giving you a longing look
And every day, every day, every day I write the book

I'm giving you a longing look
Every day I write the book

I'm giving you a longing look
And every day, every day, every day I write the book
Every day, every day, every day I write the book
I'm giving you a longing look
And every day, every day, every day I write the book
