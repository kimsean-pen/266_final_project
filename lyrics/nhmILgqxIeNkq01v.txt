Who can tell me if we have Heaven?
Who can say the way it should be?
Moonlight Holly
The Sappho Comet
Angel's tears below a tree
You talk of the break of morning
As you view the new aurora
Cloud in crimson
The key of heaven
One love carved in Acajou
One told me of China Roses
One a thousand nights and one night
Earth's last picture
The end of evening
Hue of indigo and blue
A new Moon leads me to
Woods of dreams
And I follow
A new world waits for me
My dream, my way
I know that if I have heaven
There is nothing to desire
Rain and river
A world of wonder
May be Paradise to me
