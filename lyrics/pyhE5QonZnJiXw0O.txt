Please speak to me and don't stare
And tell me where, where I should go
Still don't know what to expect
But I know that with you
You're just holding me back
Oh this winter is cold and numbing sick
Here's the times when I can't breathe correct
Condensation blowing far from this
Palpitations in my heart command
Please speak to me and don't stare
And tell me where, where I should go
Still don't know what to expect
But I know that with you
You're just holding me back
You're just holding me back
You're just holding me
Please speak to me and don't stare
And tell me where, where I should go
Still don't know what to expect
But I know that with you
You're just holding me back
