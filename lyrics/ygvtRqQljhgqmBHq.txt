You seem too good
Too good to be true

You're
Holding me stronger
Stronger
Than I'm used to

Don't go out
With the boys tonight

I won't sleep a wink
Wondering
What you're doing
Don't go out

With the girls tonight
I will turn to drink
Wondering
Who you're screwing

You seem too good
Too good to be true
I'm loving you longer
Longer

That I'm used to
Don't go out
With the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink

Wondering
What you're doing
Don't go out
With the girls tonight

I will turn to drink
Wondering
Who you're screwing
Tug of war

Sweet as sin
I let go
I fell in
Feel the pull
Call your name
I'm alone
Once again
Tug of war
Sweet as sin
I let go
I fell in
Feel the pull
Call your name
I'm alone

Once again

Don't go out
With the boys tonight

I won't sleep a wink
Wondering
What you're doing
Don't go out
With the girls tonight
I will turn to drink
Wondering
Who you're screwing
Tug of war
Sweet as sin
I let go
I fell in
Feel the pull
Call your name
I'm alone
Once again
Tug of war (Don't go out with the boys tonight)
Sweet as sin (You seem too good)
I let go (Too good to be true)
I fell in
Feel the pull (Don't go out with the girls tonight) (I'm loving you longer)
Call your name (I will turn to drink)
I'm alone
Once again (Longer than I'm used to)

Tug of war (Don't go out with the boys tonight)
Sweet as sin (You seem too good)
I let go (Too good to be true)
I fell in
Feel the pull (Don't go out with the girls tonight) (You seem too good)
Call your name (I will turn to drink)
I'm alone
Once again (Too good to be true)

(Tug of war)
(Feel the pull) (Don't go out with the boys tonight)
(Tug of war)
(Feel the pull)
