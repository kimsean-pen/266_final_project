I never can say goodbye
(No, no, no, no, I)
I never can say goodbye, no

Even though the pain and heartaches
Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seems to show

Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why, is it so

I never can say goodbye, no
(No, no, no, no, I)
I never can say goodbye

Everytime I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right to the core
It says, "Turn around, you fool
You know you love her more and more"
Tell me why, is it so

I don't wanna you let go
I can't say goodbye
Oh I, I never say goodbye
(Never could say goodbye)
(No matter how hard I try)

I never can say goodbye, no
(No, no, no, no, I)
I never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are gonna all work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
That makes that anguish, twist that doubt
It's what that same old dizzy hangup
Can do with you all the time
Tell me why, is it so

I don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye
Oh I, I never say goodbye
(Never gonna say goodbye)
(No matter how hard I try)

They gonna let you go
(Never gonna say goodbye)
I can't say goodbye
I need you so, oh yeah

(Never gonna say goodbye)
(No matter how hard I try)
You're my one and only lover
(Never gonna say goodbye)
I can't say goodbye
Don't want another...
