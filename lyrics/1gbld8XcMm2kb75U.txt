Will I rise, from the ashes we create?
Will I fall, into oblivion?
When I look up to this tower with a soul that's ripped apart
I see my death before me and the path is cold and dark

I feel the flames surrounding my heart
Watching my soul being torn apart
Twenty-six years I've been digging my grave
Climbing the Tower of Pain
Fear shouldn't be deciding my fate
My agony shouldn't be holding this weight
When my heart no longer beats what will I say?

Will I rise, from the ashes we create?
Will I fall, into oblivion?
When I look up to this tower with a soul that's ripped apart
I see my death before me and the path is cold and dark

I hear the whisper of death in my ear
Hell is safe for those who don't fear
Twenty-six years being told I'm a slave
Trading desire away

Fear shouldn't be deciding my fate
My agony shouldn't be holding this weight
When my heart no longer beats what will I say?

Will I rise, from the ashes we create?
Will I fall, into oblivion?
When I look up to this tower with a soul that's ripped apart
I see my death before me and the path is cold and dark

Hell shouldn't draw me closer to heaven
Death shouldn't pull me closer to faith
Hell shouldn't draw me closer to heaven
Death shouldn't pull me closer to faith
I will climb the Tower of Pain
Blegh
Tower of Pain
