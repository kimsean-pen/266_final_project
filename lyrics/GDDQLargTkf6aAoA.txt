We'll make a scratch
On fingernails
Until it's all gone
Pulling at
Every thread
Stuck in a back room
So who's hiding up
Who's hiding up
You lose and you laugh (?)
Who's hiding up
We'll make this last
(?) now
Burning your hands
What's it worth waiting for?
Swimming to you
Crawling in your touch
Burning your hands
What's it worth waiting for?
Swimming to you
Crawling in your touch
Break the bones you call your own
Lost a place to call your home
Break the bones you call your own
Lost a place to call your home
Burning your hands
What's it worth waiting for?
Swimming to you
Crawling in your touch
Burning your hands
What's it worth waiting for?
Swimming to you
Crawling in your touch
Break the bones you call your own
Lost a place to call your home
Break the bones you call your own
Lost a place to call your home
