Their cries are blown away with the wind
How passive can we be before humanity is lost?
Turning our backs on those who need love.
We must not rest while healing is needed.

Tear down the veil that bars your heart from feeling this.
Dedicate yourself.
Give your soul to compassion.
With open arms embrace this heart.
With open eyes behold the truth.
Embrace this life.

So little time is left.

We must be relentless in our pursuit of those in torment.
Tear down the veil that bars your heart from feeling this.
Dedicate yourself.
Become the voice of compassion.
With open arms embrace this heart.
With open eyes behold the truth.
Embrace this life.

Can you reject yourself?
Can you feel their agony?
In a world that feeds on disregard.
Heal the broken hearted.
