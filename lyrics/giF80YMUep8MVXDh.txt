He was my lover, he was working undercover
The fellow knew all of the moves
He really had me romping, bare footing stomping
He just kept igniting my fuse

He was blinded by the blackness of my long silk stocking
He would rock me with an optical illusion
And this ain? t how I thought it'd be
He just kept on keeping me in a state of total confusion

He took me for a ride and rattled me down to my shoes
But I found out he was an undercover agent for the blues, yeah

He never really needed love from any direction, no
I was just an innocent bystander
He just kept getting kinkier, hook, line and sinker
Ju-ju-just too hot to handle

He took me by storm, it must have been a season for the fools
So bad, he was an undercover agent for the blues

He took me for a ride and rattled me down to my shoes
But I found out he was an undercover agent for the blues

He never really needed love from any direction, no
I was just an innocent bystander
He just kept getting kinkier, hook, line and sinker
Yeah yeah, he just, just too hot to handle

He was blinded by the blackness of my long silk stocking
I was rocking with an optical illusion
And this ain? t how I thought it'd be
He just kept on keeping me in a state of total confusion

He took me for a ride and rattled me down to my shoes
I found out he was an undercover agent for the blues
So bad, an undercover agent for the blues
I found out he was an undercover agent for the blues

Hmm, for the blues
For the blues
Undercover agent
Undercover for the blues
For the blues
Undercover agent
