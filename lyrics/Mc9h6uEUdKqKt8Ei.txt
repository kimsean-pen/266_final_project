Making the choice of being here or there,
Is the hardest thing I've had to do.

It's not as clear and concise as one would think.
I'm following my hopes and dreams,
And doing what's right for me.

A line was drawn, my choice was made

Given the chance, I'll make you proud of me
Give me a chance, I promise to succeed

It's not as clear and concise as one would think.
I'm following my hopes and dreams,
And doing what's right for me.

A line was drawn and then my choice was made.

A line was drawn. My choice was made
