Why can't you say sorrow
Why can't you say think I believe
Thou must not steal borrow
Why must you steal things I receive?

Why can't you say sorrow
Why can't you say think I believe
Why must you steal borrow
Always conceal cling to belief

Damaged this way hollowed
Living the lie that you can't take
Damaged maintained solemn
Living for rules you only break

How can you say?

The enemy is thrown into the sadness,
For the enemy there's only pain and sadness then death...
