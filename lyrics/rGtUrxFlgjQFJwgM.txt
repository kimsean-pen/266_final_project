Glitter on the west streets
Silver over everything
The river's all wet
You're all chrome
Dripping with alchemy
Shiver stop shivering

The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome
The men cry out the girls cry out
The men cry out the girls cry out

The men cry out, oh no
The men cry out the girls cry out
The men cry out the girls cry out
The men cry out, oh no

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Off off with your head
Dance dance 'til you're dead dead

Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll

On the floor

Off off with your head
Dance dance 'til you're dead
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
On the floor

Look in my eyes
Take the past
Shut your eyes
Realize
Look in my eyes
Take the past
Shut your eyes
Realize
