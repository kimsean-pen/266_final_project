Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today to celebrate an electric life
Under violet sky
I pray you hear our cry
Please help us protect what's right (Amen)

Gather your thoughts, gather around
Painted arrangements mixed from a pallet of sound
A casket froze in indigo, royal and profound
Many stems like hymns once blossomed from ground
But while the reaper is king, we carry the crown
We weigh it out, dreaming, screaming or close to even
In this sense nobody's perfect, nobody is worthless
The system's imperfect, maybe we should measure in purpose
What is yours? What is mine? When do we serve it?
Being hood ain't the absence of good
Being square don't make you equal or fair, it's not an equal affair
Weak voices can't speak for a share
Speak choices with no when or a where, are you aware? I don't think so
Unless your cup runneth over and you still sip slow
Or guzzle til' nothing, complaining when you don't get mo'
See another's glass empty and you don't think poor/pour

The upper room is calling
What are we supposed to do?
There ain't nothing in this world that can take your place
The upper room is calling
It appears it's just for you
There ain't nothing in this world that can take your place

Faith, we treat it like a four letter word
While fear, we shout it through the ghettos and burbs
Hear me my Lord, come settle my nerves
I pray these words bring honor as the heavens observe
And to the sky where the birds will testify
Freedom's a state of mind be free any day or time
Reality will make you doubt your actuality
The truest fallacy is man can't change how he sees
So it's death to reason, it's left the legions
Wondering where to pledge allegiance
This is my letter to Ephesians, the rest, we need them
Through death, the best are leavin'

The upper room is calling
What are we suppose to do?
The upper room is calling
It appears it's just for you

Some people play the victim, some people play the fool
Some people pay the dealer while others pay the dues
I don't know what's realer, the struggle and the strain
Or the guilt that can be built within when making gains
Ain't no cheatin' death, you can't lie to life
Plus everything about you's hiding in these satellites
Outside of the one day that Adam had it right
Humans are parasites, insatiable appetites
"So where do we go from there?" You ask
I think we all trying to figure that out?
One nation under a God kickin' us out
'Cause America took and takes the infamous route
As we state from state to state let's be great again
Let's forget the salient struggle of each alien
Parade after you honor the graves
Of natives, slaves, women, gays
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera
