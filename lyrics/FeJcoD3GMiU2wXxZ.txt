Time, oh time
Got sucked into a culture, living like you do
Spending by the hour, living like you do
Can't make ends meet, living like you do
This life will turn you sober, living like I do.

And the tension builds x5
Up in you, oh, up in you, oh, up in you

Living without worries, need the space to move
Move in such a hurry, so such time to lose
Staring at my window, we're so married to
Reflecting from the faint glow staring back at you

And the best has passed, and the best has
And the best has passed, and the best has passed
Passed for you, yeah passed for you, yeah passed for you, yeah passed for you
Now the tension, now the tension builds, now the tension builds,
Now the tension builds, now the tension builds,
Up in you, yeah, up in you, yeah, up in you, oh up in you

I need another in my life, oho x9

Got sucked into a culture living like I do
Can't make ends meet living like I do
x3

Living like I do x3
Living like, living like I do
Living like... living like I do
