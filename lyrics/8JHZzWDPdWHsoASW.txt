We come for war
King of the north and norse
With drums beating, screams repeating and the hammer force of Thor
Surrender not enough
The Christian seed will sing amongst the soil of trees

From the sea is the destroyer
From the sea is an eagle drenched in blood
Blood eagle
Blood eagle is the destroyer
Blood eagle will set the wicked free

Rip the body from the bone now
Spread the heavens wings
Show Valhalla glory and memory
Let 'em
Let 'em
Let the Christians sing

Rip the body from the bone now
Spread the heavens wings
Show Valhalla glory and memory
Let 'em
Let 'em
Let 'em sing

Let out the roar
Barbaric to the core
A storm brewing, all our doing for Odin's at the door
The spoils are not enough
We'll let 'em bleed
The moon takes everyone tonight

The Christians sing
How they sing amongst the broken wings
From the sea is the eagle drenched in blood
The Christians sing
How they sing amongst the broken wings

A soul descending swiftly
The burning stench of afterlife
No rays from heaven
Only high sun

A soul descending swiftly
The burning stench of afterlife
No grace from heaven
And no son

Pleading to the sky once more
Weeping for the self
For the abandoned children of Christ
Have been laid to waste on the shelf
Pour out the tide of Valkyries
The land is ours to claim
No man or woman escaped the fire

Pour out the tide of Valkyries
The land is ours to claim
No man or woman escaped the fire

Now let 'em sing
Now sing
(The tide of Valkyries)
(The tide of Valkyries)
Now sing

We come for war
King of the north and norse
With drums beating, screams repeating and the hammer force of Thor
Surrender not enough
We'll let 'em bleed
The moon takes everyone tonight

We come for war
We come for war
We come for war
