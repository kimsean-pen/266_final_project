I can't control the way I'm movin my hips
Bet you never ever seen me like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
No no it's automatic
It's automatic

It's automatic I'm a run away train
And it's likely that I tear up this place
When I go I go hard
I'mma show you bizarre tonight, tonight (ni-i-ight)
It's automatic my condition's unknown
There's no remedy and no antidote
It's just the way that I am
Nicki Nicki so bad tonight, tonight (ni-i-ight)

I can't control the way I'm movin' my hips
Bet you never ever seen me like this
I'm a monster on the floor I can't quit
No no it's automatic, it's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic

It's automatic some might call it insane
I assure you I'll be stuck in your brain
You'll be falling for me boy, yeah
Just like a domino tonight, tonight (ni-i-ight)
It's automatic when I'm rockin' the beat
Systematically I'm droppin' your heat
It's just the way that I am
Nicki Nicki so bad tonight, tonight (night)

I can't control the way I'm movin' my hips
Bet you never ever seen me like this
I'm monster on the floor I can't quit
No no it's automatic, it's automatic
It's automatic

Press rewind, p-p-press rewind
I-I'm Einstein, I'm lookin' for that Einstein
Wales, London, Ireland
Scotland I can idle in
South Africa and Brazil
Shut the club down, bring the bill

Ri-ri-ri-ri-ring the bill
Br-bri-bri-bri-bring the bill
Bri-bri-bring the bill
Shut the club down, bring the bill

I can't control the way I'm movin' my hips
Bet you never ever seen me like this
I'm a monster on the floor I can't quit
No no it's automatic, it's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
