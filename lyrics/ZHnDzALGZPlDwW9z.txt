I want it, I want it
I want it
I want it, I want it
I want it

JAGUAR trap

JAGUAR trap

I want it, I want it, i want it
I need you walking with me, too
i want, it i want, it i want it
never

JAGUAR trap, I don't know where I go

And never make my soul at ease
And then never again
Never
JAGUAR trap
Never into me
