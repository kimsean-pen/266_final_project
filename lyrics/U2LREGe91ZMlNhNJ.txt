There's a little child
Running around this house
And he never leaves
He will never leave

And the fog comes up
From the sewers
And glows
In the dark
Baby alligators in the sewers
Grow up fast, grow up fast
Anything you want, it can be done
How did you go bad?

Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Somethings will never wash away
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
