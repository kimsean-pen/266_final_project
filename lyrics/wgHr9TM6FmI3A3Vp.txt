Fire was my faith
Earth you were my truth
Air you gave me life
As four we gave birth to the world
Now they choke me
Disrupt me
As I wither and dry up they're growing stronger

The flames are searing through the night
The ground beneath me is parting
Tortured by the wind
Brisk the storm embraces my wrath
Sealing my waves
Fire, wind and earth

Flames I could drown
Earth, you I held down
Air, I made you cry
Now I'm alone, they turned on me
Now they haunt me
They taunt me
I'm old and weak so soon I'll be no more

The flames are searing through the night
The ground beneath me is parting
Tortured by the wind
Brisk the storm embraces my wrath
Sealing my waves
Fire, wind and earth

Now it's winter, I'm dying, I'm dying
Now it's colder, I'm freezing, I'm freezing

The flames are searing through the night
The ground beneath me is parting
Tortured by the wind
Brisk the storm embraces my wrath
Sealing my waves
Fire, wind and earth
