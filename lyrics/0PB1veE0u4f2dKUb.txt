Flame! Universal flame!
Can't stand the shame!
Universal flame!
The universe unfolds for you tonight

Through all the ways you've tried to rid your lives of crying I know,
The world is full of all the sickness and the dying heroes

So far away - you know who you are
You are so far away - Only wanted to be with you

Flame! Universal flame!
The universe unfolds for you tonight.

Through all the winds of change and all the people lying for you,
You are of golden mind the passion overflowing from you

So far away - you know who you are
You are so far away - Look for hope and it will find you!

Flame! (you know who you are)
Universal flame! (look for hope its searching for you)
Flame! (you know who you are)
Universal flame!
The universe unfolds for you tonight.

I won't hold back anything
And I won't care if you won't hear
Cause all I want is to be true
And say to all that I love you tonight

So far away, you are so far away...

Can't stand the shame!
Universal flame!
Can't stand the shame!
Universal flame!
The universe unfolds for you tonight.

Though you feel you're far gone
Never to love again
Remember to have faith now
The sun will rise again!
