Do you remember my friend
When I was frozen and dead inside
A piece of nothing in this world
Till I heard she said

Three nights of hell
Immortality spell (spell)
Light up the sky
Make it through the darkness

Can you believe this my friend
I was empty and broken inside
She came to save me from the storm
When I heard she said

Three nights of hell
Immortality spell (spell)
Light up the sky
Make it through the darkness

Three nights of hell
Immortality spell (spell)
Light up the sky
Make it through the darkness

Blood
Tears
Dust
Take my blood
Tears
Dust

Praying belongs to you an I
There's nowhere else I wished
I could be
Now this fine dark river flows
The wind will blow a fire will burn (Rise)
Will burn
Will burn (Spell)
Will burn
A Fire will burn (Darkness)

Three nights of hell
Immortality spell (spell)
Light up the sky
Make it through the darkness
