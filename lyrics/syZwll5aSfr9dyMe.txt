We are here
We can love
We share something
I'm sure that you mean the world to me

Your name was the one
That was always chosen
Your words and their kindness
Have set me free

Shame has a hold
That's kept us frozen
You opened my eyes to a world
That I could believe

Words can leave you
Broken inside
You'll have to decide
I'm hanging on to my pride

We are here
We can love
We share something
I'm sure that you mean the world to me
When you get what you need
There's no way of knowing
What you'll have
Is another hole to feed

The games that were played
Have left us hoping
The gift that we have - the life
That we breathe

This world can leave you
Broken inside
With nowhere to hide
I'm hanging on to my pride

We are here
We've been chosen
We've been blessed with a place
We need to find and then open

We are here
We can love
We share something
I'm sure that you mean the world to me
When you get what you need
There's no way of knowing
What you'll have
Is another hole to feed
