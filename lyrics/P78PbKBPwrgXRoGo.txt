I need a cha cha beat boy

They tried to tell me you can always have it your way
They tried to keep me out of class in the hallways
They tried to tell me your looks will fade some day
Maybe you, not me bitch

Ima be sexy forever
Yeah yeah
Ima be sexy forever
Yeah yeah
Ima be sexy forever
Yeah yeah
Ima be sexy forever
Yeah yeah

Young Asian man pulling your girl
Twisting off like a soda
Stretch it out like it's yoga
I'm on the hunt like a vulture
Them pretty things kill like mocha
Let the pretty things kill like coca
Up and down, rollercoaster
Bouncin', bouncin', bouncin' (ya)

Living life, gotta hustle no more (ya)
Way up loving my view (ay)
Bless me ya, I choose so that they see that I'm wavy
No fuckin' or riot, I be reppin' the town
All of the family they fuckin' proud
Takin' it H1GHR but it's going down
Takin' it H1GHR but it's going down

They tried to tell me you can always have it your way
They tried to keep me out of class in the hallways
They tried to tell me your looks will fade some day
Maybe you, not me bitch

Ima be sexy forever
Yeah yeah
Ima be sexy forever
Yeah yeah
Ima be sexy forever
Yeah yeah
Ima be sexy forever
Yeah yeah

Boy look me up when I'm like 80
Fuck around take your litty
Loius V button up chest ironed
Everyday a fucking fiesta
Champagne and souffle
Silk sheets where I lay
Stick me in a cake
A had a bitch lit all day
I'm a motherfucking sex symbol
Be up in a hospital
'Cause I look so good, that it hurts like a hot pimple
Don't really care about no fashion trends
Rock whatever make the bitch look good
They hating on how I'm moving next
Motherfuckers only wish they could

Ima be sexy forever
Ima be sexy forever
Look at me rocking whatever
Look at me rocking whatever
Ima be making this cheddar
Ima be making this cheddar
I know that you're doing you
But Ima be sexy forever

Ima be sexy forever
Yeah yeah
Ima be sexy forever
Yeah yeah
Ima be sexy forever
Yeah yeah
Ima be sexy forever
Yeah yeah
