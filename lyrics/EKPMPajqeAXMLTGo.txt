Those long afternoons
When nobody was home but me
Sun is shining but I dwell in shadow
Maraschino-red dress, $8.99 at Goodwill
I was looking over my shoulder
At the register trying not to be seen
Looking over my shoulder at all

I had appointments today, errands to run
I watch the hours drain away
I watch the hours drain away

Mid-grade bourbon sitting in the cabinet
This day's shot anyway
And a couple of beers left from two nights ago
I am hideous and no-one can ever know
When the sun gets low-down, bloody and red
I tie a little knot at the centre of my head
I don't think I'll be showing up
At synagogue at quarter past seven

Sometimes you go through hell and you
Never get to heaven
Sometimes you go through hell and you
Never get to heaven

But I thank God
Who gives strength to the weary
I thank God
Who gives strength to the weary
