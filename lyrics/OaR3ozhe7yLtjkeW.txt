Drove by your old apartment
Looking for a way to start it over again
Cuz you've been stuck in my head
Tried to open up about it
Called a friend to clear my conscience
They said there's nothing, nothing

I miss you like hell
I miss you like hell
I miss you like hell
I miss you like hell and I don't know what to do about it

Climbed to the roof and looked out
Stood on the edge and looked down
Holding my breath so I get to feel something now
Found a girl that looks just like you
She doesn't do the things that you do
I get upset at nothing, nothing

I miss you like hell
I miss you like hell
I miss you like hell
I miss you like hell and I don't know what to do about it

Parked at the fields where we met
Tell me where the hell has time been
Every day I feel like I'm just stuck on repeat
Do you ever think about it
Cold sweats, three in the morning
Do you ever feel it, feel it

I miss you like
I miss you like hell
I miss you like hell
I miss you like hell and I don't know what to do about it

(I miss you) No, I don't know
(I miss you) I miss you like hell
I miss you like hell (I miss you)
I don't know what to do about it
(I miss you) No, no (I miss you)
I don't know what to do about it
