Rose coloured glasses
they couldn't shield anything
Golden flames that burn
they couldn't heal me from within
Disperse the heat, let the cold sweep in, oho
Bursting languid light, as my head and body spin
When your skin doesn't feel like home
And I don't wanna break down and feel alone
This body only knows, oho
How to hold back more than it shows, oh, oh, oh
Superstition that found itself in the way
Of a freed premonition that could have helped me escape
It's a wrong kind of victory
Disguised as a breakthrough
It's hard when nothing feels like it used to
When your skin doesn't feel like home, oho
And I don't wanna break down and feel alone, oh, oh, oh
This body only knows, oho
How to hold back more than it shows, oh, oh, oh
Hairs on my head, stand on end
The spine of this truth, repel and suspend
Act like bars but should help me transcend
Hairs on my head, stand on end
The spine of this truth like cracks in the wind
Act like bars but should help me transcend
When your skin doesn't feel like home
And I don't wanna break down and feel alone, oh, oh, oh
This body only knows, oho
How to hold back more than it shows, oh
