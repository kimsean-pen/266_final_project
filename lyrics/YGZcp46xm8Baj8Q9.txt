No more Mr. Nice Guy
I'm wishing you believe in
Thinking everybody wants you
Your nose is itching and you're so slow
To tell me everything about you
Yeah, but I already know you

Don't believe in things that don't believe in you
Believe in you
All the things that you do will come back on you
See them true

You want to spend some time together
Suspended like a feather
But you're acting like a Nico
Playing with your ego
Always trying with the right crowd
Never alone turn it up loud

Don't believe in things that don't believe in you
Believe in you
All the things that you do will come back on you
so silently

No more Mr. Nce Guy

Don't believe in things that don't believe in you
Be leavin' you
All the things that you do will come back on you
So see them true
No more Mr. Nice Guy
