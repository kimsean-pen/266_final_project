Mother
I reach for the dark

Holding on and I can't decide
And I can't decide on him
Holding on and I can't seem to
Can't seem to, oh, begin

Holding on (I won't)
And I got my mind (I can't)
And I got my car (I know)
And I'm in a fire
Holding on (I won't)
And I can't decide (I can't)
On him (I know)

I won't, I can't
I know, I let you go!
I won't, I can't
I know, I let you go!

I let you go!

I know and I know
And I wait for you
Hold on and go on
'Cos I'll wait for you
Faster, faster, the leaves will fall
The sky will grey
And my skin will dull
Hold on and go on
'Cos I'll wait for you

Holding on and I can't decide
And I can't decide on him
Holding on and I can't seem to
Can't seem to, oh, begin

Holding on (I won't)
And I can't decide (I can't)
I can't decide on him (I know, I let you go!)
Holding on (I won't)
And I can't (I can't)
Seem to, can't seem to, oh, begin
(I know, I let you go!)

Can't seem to begin
Can't seem to begin
(I let you go!)
