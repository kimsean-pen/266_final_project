I'm the street lights that guide you home
I'll be the G.P.S when you've lost your phone
I'll be the song that's rockin' in your headphones
I'll show you the signs
To let you know
You'll never be alone

Hey
Let me start it off by sayin' this
You mean everything to me nothin' I wouldn't risk
Every single second and moment that passes by
I'm thinkin' about you and I really want you to know that

There's something more out there
Somethin' that will hold you very tight when you're scared
'Cause I know when times get tough and it starts to feel rough
It can feel like everythings crashin' down on ya

So when it seems like every road you're on has hit a dead end
There is hope
Let me show

I'm the street lights that guide you home
I'll be the G.P.S when you've lost your phone
I'll be the song that's rockin' in your headphones
I'll show you the signs
To let you know
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

Man
Crazy how you got this far
I'd be sittin' just wonderin' where to start
Last week you were sayin' that somethin' just ain't right
Layin' in your bed stayin' up all night

'Cause
This life is harder than it seems
But one thing I've learned is never stop chasin' your dreams
And if it, if it ever get's to hectic for you
Stop for a second and remember one thing.

So when it seems like every road you're on has hit a dead end
There is hope
Let me show

I'm the street lights that guide you home
I'll be the G.P.S when you've lost your phone
I'll be the song that's rockin' in your headphones
I'll show you the signs
To let you know
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

Sometimes life is an ocean
We're just trying to flow
We get caught in slow motion
From the undertow

Sometimes the path to choose
Is right in front of you
You just gotta let go

I'm the street lights that guide you home
I'll be the G.P.S when you've lost your phone
I'll be the song that's rockin' in your headphones
I'll show you the signs
To let you know

(You'll never be alone)

I'm the street lights that guide you home
I'll be the G.P.S when you've lost your phone
I'll be the song that's rockin' in your headphones
I'll show you the signs
To let you know
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
