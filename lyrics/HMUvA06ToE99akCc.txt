I know you're thinking I'd be tripping,
Thinking I'd be playing, you'll be saying I'm into you.
Just take a second, and listen
Cause I ain't into lying, don't trust anybody,
Maybe I ain't trying to kill my body so soon.
Let me know you're worth it
Do you deserve a chance to.?
To touch, to feel my love

Cause ain't nobody perfect
I don't need a surface
Can you show me your love?

And when it's time
I won't even have to tell you so
You'll see the stars are shinin the same
So take your time
Cause love ain't got nowhere to go
It will be waiting there if we wait
Cause there's no such thing as too late
When you really love somebody you can wait
Cause there's no such thing as too late

Can tell me, I'd be afraid
You're beyond saying, you ain't nothing like the other dudes
And judging from my intuition yea yea yea yea
You seem like somebody I could probly give myself to
Not so soon

Cause I want you to love me whenever you get that chance to
To touch, feel my love

Cause ain't nobody perfect
I don't need a surface
Can you show me your love?

And when it's time
I won't even have to tell you so
You'll see the stars are shinin the same
So take your time
Cause love ain't got nowhere to go
It will be waiting there if we wait
Cause there's no such thing as too late
When you really love somebody you can wait
Cause there's no such thing as too late

Listen to my heart and I'll listen to yours
And if they say the same thing then I'll know it then
But until then we should be patient
Let's not start
But when we start I promise you gon love me baby

And when it's time
I won't even have to tell you so
You'll see the stars are shinin the same
So take your time
Cause love ain't got nowhere to go
It will be waiting there if we wait
Cause there's no such thing as too late
When you really love somebody you can wait
(Don't You Think?)
Cause there's no such thing as too late
