Any minute you will feel
The chemistry
Vibrations in the brain
Can't ever be explained

Slip away and out of sigh
Feel the magnet of a night
The circus lights you see
Is where you have to be

If I've seen it all before
Why's this bus taking me back again
If I don't need anymore
Why's this bus taking me back again

Feel the weight of letting go
Feel more lightness than you've ever known
You can't see when light's so strong
You can't see when light is gone

If I've seen it all before
Why's this bus taking me back again
If I don't need anymore
Why's this bus taking me back again
