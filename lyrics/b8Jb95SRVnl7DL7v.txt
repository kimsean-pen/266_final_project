put that gun to my temple
put that gun to my heart
make me walk off the plank chi cha
all always in to the dark

A I D S H I V
i cannot wait to die
can't you tell
can't you tell
can't you tell

never finish my degree cha chi
never play with the Pogues
throw my head out the window and
cement my feet into the dark
