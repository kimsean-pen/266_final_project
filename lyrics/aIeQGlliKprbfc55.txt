Oh Maggie
Oh Maggie
Oh Maggie
Oh Maggie

Wake up Maggie I think I've got something to say to you
It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to stop you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

The morning sun when it's in your face it really shows your age
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to stop you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's a pain I could do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
You turned into a lover and mother what a lover you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed and in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to stop you from being alone
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you even if I tried

Oh Maggie
Oh Maggie
Oh Maggie

I suppose I could collect all my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand
Oh Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face

You made a first class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway

Oh Maggie
Oh Maggie
Oh Maggie

I think I've got something to say to you
Oh Maggie, oh Maggie
I think I've got something to say to you

Oh Maggie
Oh Maggie
Oh Maggie

I think I've got something to say to you
Oh Maggie
Come wake up, come on and wake up
Oh Maggie, oh Maggie

I think I've got something to say to you
I think I've got something to say to you
Oh Maggie, oh Maggie
I think I've got something to say to you

All I needed was a guiding hand
And in the morning you'd kick me in the head
And get me out of your bed
