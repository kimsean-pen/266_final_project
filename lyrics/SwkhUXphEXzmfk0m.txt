No I'll never let you down, you down
No I'll never let you down again

Headphones - Headphones
Stereo in my ear
Rainbows - Rainbows
Above my head I see you
Hello - Hello
Like I was never here
Ain't got nobody
Ain't got nothing I can feel

Blackout, - Blackout
I'm on my way downtown
They shout - They shout
Accelerating sounds
Sold out - Sold out
I cut across the crowd
The club is fading and I'm starin' at the dancefloor

Now I see your face again
This time it's love
We're more than friends

No I'll never let you down, you down
No I'll never let you down again
Baby I will never, never, never again
Baby I will never, never
Let you down again

Don't stop - Don't stop
Let's finish what we started
So hot - So hot
So close to brokenhearted
I got - You got
The tickets to the stars and
I promise everything to you I cannot keep right now

Now I see you dance again
This time for real
We're more than friends

I wanna fly with you above the end
I'll promise you I'll be a better man again

No I – Never let
No I – Never let
No I'll never let you down again
Baby I will never, never, never again
Baby I will never, never
Let you down again

I'll never let you down
Never let you down
