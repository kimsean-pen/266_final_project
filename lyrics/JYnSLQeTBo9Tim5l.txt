Sleeping through the evening
singing dreams inside my head
I'm heading out
I've got some "ins"
who say they care and they just might
I run away with you if things don't go as planned
Planning big could be a gamble
I've already rolled the dice
I spit & stutter
stuff and clutter
worries in my worried corner
Maladjusted, just, untrusted, rusted,
Sometimes brilliant busted thoughts
Think I'll stay for a while
I'm intrigued and I'm
Red as a newborn white as a corpse

I promise not to try not to fuck with your mind
I promise not to mind if you go your way and I go mine
I promise not to lie if I'm looking you straight in the eye
I promise not to try not to let you down

I am elated I am
all smiles and dated
In my "man-bites-dog" town
with a Spanish name
I am all bone
I am two toned
red as a newborn white as a corpse

I promise not to try not to fuck with your mind
I promise not to mind if you go your way and I go mine
I promise not to lie if I'm looking you straight in the eye
I promise not to try not to let you down
(so let me down... slow)

Why you gotta keep the fan on high when it's cold outside?
Just want to let you know that I'm still a fan... get it?
Everybody wants charm and a smile and a promise
Well I promise not to try

I promise not to try not to fuck with your mind
I promise not to mind if you go your way and I go mine
I promise not to lie if I'm looking you straight in the eye
I promise not to try not to not to not to leave

(Promise not to try)
Not to leave
(Promise not to try)
Not to not to leave
(Promise not to try)
I won't leave
I won't leave
