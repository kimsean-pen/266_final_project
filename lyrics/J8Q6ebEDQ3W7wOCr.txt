Child will you come on down
Come on in with me
Morning says to idle on
Stay clear of the street.
On the wing
And on the land
Can you sing
With anything

Do you wanna dance
Do ya
Do ya, do ya, do ya wanna dance
Stroke it Noel

They say we're lazy men
Drinkin' our white wine
We could go right insane
'Cause we can buy the time
Oh, keep an eye
On the sky
Will they come
Oh the bombs

Do you wanna dance
Easy now, easy now
Do ya, do ya, do ya wanna dance
Do ya wanna, do ya, wanna dance
