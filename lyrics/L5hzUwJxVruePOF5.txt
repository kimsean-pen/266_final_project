you wore a hand-me-down dress that never fit quite right.
your mother's frame did not favor you.

the summer she passed you were born, and you father lost his job.
he could not handle it (or you).

you wore the saddest smile that never fit quite right.
your mother's smile felt that way too.

the summer she gave her life for you, and your father blamed you,
was the summer you began to blame yourself too.
