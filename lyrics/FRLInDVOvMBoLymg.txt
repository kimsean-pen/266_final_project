I know I've hurt you
I've gone and made a mess tonight
With retaliation on my mind
I'm already through
It's a losing game
When we keep trading pain for pain
Oh I'm tired and I don't want to make the enemy out of you
When we wage war
And then peg the future to what came before

But when we talk about forgiveness
It's the way that we can love each other
Let it die so that death can bring life again

You know that I am hurt too
But I'm here to make amends tonight
Reconciliation on my mind
It's all I can do
It's a losing game
When we keep on trading blame for blame
Keeping count of all the wrongs we've made
Oh honey I'm through
Can we make peace?
So the anger and the pride release

And then we'll talk about forgiveness
It's the way that we can love each other
Let it die so that death can bring life again
Keep searching til we see it
And along the way we'll trust each other
Let it lie what is left is a light again

I want to see you
Again in time
With brand new eyes
I need you to see me
Invite the light
And darkness dies

And we make love the surrender
Then rise above

Then we can walk into forgiveness
It's the way we truly love each other
Let it die so that death can bring life again
Hold it high what is left is a light again
And when we talk about forgiveness
It's the way that we can love each other
Let it die so that death can bring life again
And keep on moving to forgiveness
(Hold it high what is left is a light again)
Then keep on moving to forgiveness
(Hold it high what is left is a light again)
