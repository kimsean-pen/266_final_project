This ain't something I'm used to
Don't normally catch feelings for somebody like you
Already know love games so I stay on the move
And I'm not for the loose situations

No time for beating around, round, round, round
Are you patient?
'Cause I know love takes some patience
And I don't like playing around, round, round, round

If I needed you the most
Would you be dependable
Tell me are you down, down, down
Tell me are you down to stay
Tell me are you down for me

(Tell me, tell me)
Are you down for me
(Tell me are you down)
Tell me are you down for me
(Tell me, tell me)
Are you down for me
(Tell me are you down)

You [?] for longest
I finally give you a chance
Show me you're a grown man, yeah
If you're wanting the key to my heart, oh
Well show me that you're worth it

No time for beating around, round, round, round
Are you patient?
'Cause I know love takes some patience
And I don't like playing around, round, round, round

If I needed you the most
Would you be dependable
Tell me are you down, down, down
Tell me are you down to stay
Tell me are you down for me

(Tell me, tell me)
Are you down for me
(Tell me are you down)
Tell me are you down for me
(Tell me, tell me)
Are you down for me
(Tell me are you down, ooh)
