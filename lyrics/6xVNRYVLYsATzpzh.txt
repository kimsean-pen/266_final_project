Monday (Monday)
Late again today
He'd be in trouble, though he'd say he was sorry
He'd have to hurry out - to the bus

Tuesday (Tuesday)
Horace was so sad
He'd never had a girl that he could care for
And if he was late once more
He'd be out - uh-oh!

Don't be afraid, just knock on the door
While he just stood there mumblin' a-fumblin'
Then a voice from above
Said, "Horace Wimp, this is your life
Go out and find yourself a wife
(Come on, Horace)
Make a stand and be a man
And you will have a great life planned!"
(You can do it)
(Come on, Horace)

Wednesday (Wednesday)
Horace met the girl
She was small and she was very pretty
He thought he was in love he was afraid - uh oh!

Thursday (Thursday)
Asked her for a date
The caf√© down the street, tomorrow evening
His head was reeling
When she said, "Yes, okay!"

Don't be afraid, just knock on the door
While he just stood there mumblin' a-fumblin'
Then a voice from above
Said, "Horace Wimp, this is your life
Go out and find yourself a wife
(Come on, Horace)
Make a stand and be a man
And you will have a great life planned!"
(You can do it. Come on, Horace.)

Friday (Friday)
Horace, this is it!
He asks the girl if maybe they could marry
When she says "Gladly!"
Horace cries - boo hoo!

Sunday (Sunday)
Everybody's at the church
When Horace rushes in
And says, "Now here comes my wife
For the rest of my life"
And she did

Don't be afraid, just knock on the door
While he just stood there mumblin' a-fumblin'
Then a voice from above
Said, "Horace Wimp, this is your life
Go out and find yourself a wife
(You can do it)
Make a stand and be a man
And you will have a great life planned!"
