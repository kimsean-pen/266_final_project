Well a bless my soul, what's wrong with me
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm mmmmm, yay yay, yeah

Well my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm, mmmm, yay, yay, yeah

Well please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I feel fine
When I'm near the girl that I love best
My heart beats so, it scares me to death

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my
Buttercup
I'm in love I'm all shook up

Mm mm, mmmmm, yay, yay, yeah
My tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shakin' like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine

That's to have that girl that I love so fine
She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my

Buttercup
Im in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm, mmmmm, yay, yay, yeah
Mm mm, mmmmm, yay, yay, yeah
I'm all shook up
