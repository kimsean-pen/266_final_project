Right now!

Here I am... understand
With this comes... frustration

A better way to follow through
I'm far from done
The truth is right there in front of you
A better way to follow through
I'm far from done
The truth is right there in front of me

Realize... through my eyes
I can't speak... so damn weak

A better way to follow through
I'm far from done
The truth is right there in front of you
A better way to follow through
I'm far from done
The truth is right there in front of me

The face before me shows
What my life will be
Everybody knows
Everyone but me!

A better way to follow through
I'm far from done
The truth is right there in front of you
A better way to follow through
I'm far from done
The truth is right there in front of me

Better follow
The truth is right there in front of you
Better follow
The truth is right there in front of me
