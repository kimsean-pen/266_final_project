Like a montage in a movie
Right before the hero dies
Like the first time that you listen
To your favorite singer live
Like an echo in a canyon
Like tears but you're not sad
Like a sunrise on a mountain
I wanna move you like that

(Ooh, ooh ooh)
Oh, I wanna move you like that
(Ooh, ooh ooh)

Like a symphony at sundown
In the middle of July
When a lyric really gets you
And it breaks you down inside
Like the home that you were raised in
Like faded photographs
Like the thrill of Christmas morning
Yeah, I wanna move you like that

(Ooh, ooh ooh)
Oh, I wanna move you like that
(Ooh, ooh ooh)

Like a solemn Hallelujah
Like a choir shouts Amen
Like your first time falling in love
Or a stairway up to heaven
Like a soldier who is falling
As he holds his country's flag
And he fights for freedom's calling
I wanna move you like that

(Ooh, ooh ooh)
Oh, I wanna move you like that
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
Oh oh oh oh, I wanna move you like that
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
Oh, like that, oh
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
I wanna move you like that
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
Like that
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
I wanna move you like that

Like an endless fire burning
Like a hope that fuels the light
Like the hands that simply hold you
When words can't make it right
Like the first time that I met you
I fell so hard, so fast
Like the montage in a movie
Hm, the way you move me
I wanna move you like that
