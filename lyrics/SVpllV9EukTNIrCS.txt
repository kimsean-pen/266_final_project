This has grown inside
Waiting to be bounded off for a millionth time
Tossing and shifting
Those primal energies have been fulfilling your mind

Slowly breaking the habits
You've been drawn in for so long
Time has come to expand your thoughts
And drift all visions to reality

Due to the ideological fear of our society
Predicted path have been leading your way
All starting from the same point, ending nowhere

Slowly breaking the habits
You've been drawn in for so long
Time has come to expand your thoughts
And drift all visions to reality
