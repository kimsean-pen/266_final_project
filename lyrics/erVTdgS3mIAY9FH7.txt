Picked up umbrella
Put on my bowler
Looked in mirror
Ready for the tango
I phoned a taxi
For me and Maxi
She looked fantasti
We did the tango
whoaho we danced the tango x2
dont go, we danced the tango
We drank champagne
We danced again
We had laughter
And then after
whoaho we danced the tango x2
dont go, we danced the tango
Face to face we danced
the tango
Cheek to cheek we danced
the tango
dont go, we danced the tango x4
