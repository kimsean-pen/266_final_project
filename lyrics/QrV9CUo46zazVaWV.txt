He's reading sport on the news
White man white teeth in a suit
He's got that style
And then alone in his house
He wants to take baby out
Give us a smile
Boy if you touch her again
I'll tell your wife and your kids
About that time
Cos this is not ninety-three
You lost your spot on the team
You're out of line

I've worked too hard for this chance to not be biting the hand
That feeds the hate
So have a chat to your friends 'cause it's our words that will keep
Our daughters safe
Your personality traits don't count if you put your dick
In someone's face
And no it's never too late, we sat there silently while
You kept your job and your place and your six-figure wage

Oh, are you scared of me, old man?
Or are you scared of what I'll do?
You grabbed me with an open hand
The world is grabbing back at you

Oh, are you scared of me, old man?
Or are you scared of what I'll do?
You grabbed me with an open hand
The world is grabbing back at you

Oh, are you scared of me, old man?
Or are you scared of what I'll do?
You grabbed me with an open hand
The world is grabbing back at you
