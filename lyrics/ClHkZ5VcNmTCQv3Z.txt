And what if I never kiss your lips again
Or feel the touch of your sweet embrace
How would I ever go on
Without you there's no place to belong

Well, someday love is gonna lead you back to me
But 'till it does I'll have an empty heart
So I'll just have to believe

Somewhere out there you're thinking of me

Until the day I let you go
Until we say our next hello
It's not good-bye
'Til I see you again
I'll be right here rememberin' when
And if time is on our side
There will be no tears to cry
On down the road
There is one thing I can't deny
It's not good-bye

You'd think I'd be strong enough to make it through
And rise above when the rain falls down
But it's so hard to be strong
When you've been missin' somebody so long

It's just a matter of time I'm sure
But time takes time and I can't hold on
So won't you try as hard as you can
To put my broken heart together again

Until the day I let you go
Until we say our next hello
It's not good-bye
'Til I see you again
I'll be right here rememberin' when
And if time is on our side
There will be no tears to cry
On down the road
There is one thing I can't deny
It's not good-bye

Yeah!
It's not good-bye

Until the day I let you go
Until we say our next hello
It's not good-bye
'Til I see you again
I'll be right here rememberin' when
And if time is on our side
There will be no tears to cry
On down the road

And I can't deny it's not good-bye
'Til the day I let you go
'Til we say our next hello
It's not good-bye
'Til I see you...
I'll be right here rememberin' when
And if time is on our side
There will be no tears to cry
On down the road
And I can't deny (It's not good-bye)
It's not good-bye
Good-bye
No more tears to cry...
