I feel it slip
Slip away
From my hands
All the away
My heart pounds like none
I feel it slip
Slip away

Why am i?
Why am i here?
So distant from
My old life
My heart feels so sad
What am i doing here?

Doing here

You see i'm riding endlessly
What will become of me?
This higher power knows

You see i'm waiting patiently
And what this means to me?
Nobody ever knows
No...
You see in all the warmth i feel
Is this the end of me?
Only i should know
Mine
