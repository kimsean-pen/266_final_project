I woke up and I feel like shit
I don't remember last night I'm getting sick of this
I hit the bottle when I got off stage
And got piss drunk stupid and I went in a rage
I think I might have got in a fight
Because my knuckles were bloody and I don't feel all right

I hit the bottle and I don't even care
They say I'm going to hell but I am already there

Sick and tired of being sick and tired

I wanna be free from this ball and chain
Be free from this life of pain
Be free from this ball and chain
I wanna be free from you

Now I'm full of guilt and shame
I can't point a finger cause there's no one to blame
So I say I'll never do it again
But when the sun goes down
You are my only friend
I think that I am starting to see
I have become everything I never wanted to be
I'm really getting sick of myself
Cause when I look into the mirror I see somebody else

Sick and tired of being sick and tired

I wanna be free from this ball and chain
Be free from this life of pain
Be free from this ball and chain
I wanna be free from you
I wanna be free from this ball and chain
Be free from this life of pain
Be free from this ball and chain
I wanna be free from you
Sick and tired of being sick and tired
So sick and tired of being sick and tired
So sick and tired of being sick and tired
So sick and tired of being sick and tired
I wanna be free from this ball and chain
Be free from this life of pain
Be free from this ball and chain
I wanna be free from you
I wanna be free from this ball and chain
Be free from this life of pain
Be free from this ball and chain
I wanna be free from you
I wanna be free from you
