Sometimes, just drifting
In this simple world
Like a country stream,
Asleep to discussion
(the numbness of content)
I see you smile drifting.
Like a country stream,
My little girl,
Precious and pure
As I fall back,
Into softness and sleep
You Caresse me with simple love
You possess me with
Simple love.

A Caresse is just a touch,
And you touched my heart, and now that we're together
You and I will never part.

You Caresse me with simple love,
You possess me with simple love,
Place becomes time
Space becomes mine
And all ways,
Like this robe,
Green like a country dream
You surround me, and cover me
Protect me and Caresse me
With that special simple love,

Sometimes, just drifting,
Like a country stream
Precious and pure,
I see you smile
Asleep to discussion
Of this simple word,
The numbness of content
Drifting
Like a country scene
As I fall back
Into softness and sleep
You possess me with
Simple love.
You Caresse me with simple love,
You possess me with simple love,
Space becomes time,
Place becomes mind
And all ways
Like this rose
Seen like a country stream
You surround me
And comfort me,
Protect me
And Caresse me
With that special simple love.
