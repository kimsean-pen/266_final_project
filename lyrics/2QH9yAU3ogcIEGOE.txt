Seen it all
But I've seen nothing yet
'Cause i forget do i know?
Or do I think I know
It's so real
It's so clear
She takes my time
But I don't mind
She makes me feel like

Like I can see for miles
She changes the weather in my words
Seems like it's never getting cold
It's ok, it's not obvious

'cause what you say will make my day
Rid of consequence
It's so weird
But it's so clear
She takes my time

But I don't mind
She makes me feel like
Like I can see for miles
She changes the weather in my words

Seems like it's never getting old
She takes my time
But I don't mind
She makes me feel like
Like I can see for miles
She changes the weather in my world
Seems like its never getting cold.
