Sometimes I don't know where we going
Sometimes I feel you should be crawling back to me
Time is ticking by without us knowing
Before you know it it will be too late to see

You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
You try to fake it but you're breaking every rule
Right from the start you always made me feel a fool
Don't get your hiding come between us after all

You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all

Sense at all, sense at all, sense at all, sense at all
Sense at all, sense at all, sense at all, sense at all
Sense at all

Sometimes I don't know where we going
Sometimes I feel you should be crawling back to me
Time is ticking by without us knowing
Before you know it, it will be too late to see

You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
You try to fake it but you're breaking every rule
Right from the start you always made me feel a fool
Why can't your hiding come between us after all?

Sometimes I don't know where we going
Time is ticking by without us knowing

You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
You try to fake it but you're breaking every rule
Right from the start you've always made me feel a fool
Don't get your hiding come between us after all

You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
Sense at all
Sense at all
Sense at all
Sense at all
Sense at all
Sense at all
Sense at all
Sense at all
