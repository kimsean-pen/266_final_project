How long have you known about it?
Did you know it from the start?
Did you know when I told you that I loved you, baby? Ooh
And what did you tell him?
I know it ain't the truth
So I said

Every note
Of every chord
Of every song
Reminds me
Every note
Of every chord
Of every song
Reminds me that you gave up
You sold me out

So long since I've wrote about it
I should have known it from the start
I should have known when you told me that you loved me, baby
But what did you tell me
I'ma hope it ain't the truth
So I said

Every note
Of every chord
Of every song
Reminds me
Every note
Of every chord
Of every song
Reminds me that you gave up
You sold me out

So I said

Every note
Of every chord
Of every song
Reminds me
Every note
Of every chord
Of every song
Reminds me that you gave up
You sold me out

Every note
Of every chord
Of every song
Reminds me
Every note
Of every chord
Of every song
Reminds me that you gave up
You sold me out
