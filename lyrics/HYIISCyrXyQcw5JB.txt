Mistah
Sitting in the corner sipping on his gin
(Mistah)
Must be my good karma, it brought me next to him
(Mistah)
He said he like the color when he look in my eye
(Mistah)
His lips are like nirvana, his kisses paradise

He like to role play and talk dirty, keep me up 'til four thirty
Play Marco Polo, feeling 'round with his eyes closed
Call me Cleopatra, make me watch in the mirror
Don't wanna say, "told you so"

But, ah ah ah, ah ah ah
As long as you love me, this could get ugly
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Yeah, baby, trust me, this could get ugly, but that means
It's fucking good, real fucking good
It's fucking good, loving me like you should
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Yeah, baby, trust me, this could get ugly

(Mistah)
Honeymoon is over, roses on the floor
(Mistah)
Screaming out accusing, calling me a whore
(Mistah)
Your words are shaking me, giving me whiplash
(Mistah)
We're on a trampoline and soon we're gonna crash

But, ah ah ah, ah ah ah
As long as you love me, this could get ugly
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Yeah, baby, trust me, this could get ugly, but that means
It's fucking good, real fucking good
It's fucking good, loving me like you should
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Yeah, baby, trust me, this could get ugly...

But, ah ah ah, ah ah ah
As long as you love me, this could get ugly
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Yeah, baby, trust me, this could get ugly, but that means
It's fucking good, real fucking good
It's fucking good, loving me like you should
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Yeah, baby, trust me, this could get ugly
