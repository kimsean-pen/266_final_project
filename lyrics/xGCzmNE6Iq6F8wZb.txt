Inside my mind there is a man
He's always bragging about his plans
He says he's never gonna leave
(I'm never gonna leave you alone)

Despite your efforts to be free
Your mind and always you will be
At the end of the rope always singing
(Woe is me)

And I know I have to but I don't know how
(Go! Go! Go! Go!)
And I know that he knows I can do without
(Go! Go! Go! Go!)
And he knows that I need it so bad
Then I realize it's clear that he knows that
That in the end, he'll never know what hides inside my head

I don't want to seem ungrateful
I don't want to seem like I don't need anyone's help
To get me through the rainy days
To push through the haze
So I can get on my feet
And I can stand up and do what it takes

You heard his story now hear mine
(I live inside a coward's mind)
Where every dream I dream gets shot down
(All of the time)

If I don't jump into the fray
(He bums around and wastes our days)
He's like an anchor being tied to me
(Tied around my waist)

And you know you have to but you don't know how
(Go! Go! Go! Go!)
And you know that I know you can do without
(Go! Go! Go! Go!)
And I know that you need it so bad
Then I realize it's clear that you know that
In the end, I'll never know what hides inside your head

I don't want to seem ungrateful
I don't want to seem like I don't need anyone's help
To get me through the rainy days
To push through the haze
So I can get on my feet
And I can stand up and do what it takes

Hey, I don't want to seem ungrateful
I don't want to seem like I don't need anyone's help
To get me through the rainy days
To push through the haze
So I can get on my feet
And I can stand up and do what it takes [x2]
