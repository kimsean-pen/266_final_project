pick me up in an hour or so
I don't really recommend it, no
they'll probably just put you down
I believe you
I wanna be you
I believe you
I wanna be you
I know you're not through with it yet
it's a big decision
you can't kick when you're down
got a feeling kind of like a cough
ain't nothing gonna shake it off
ain't nothing gonna shake it off
until you talk out loud
I believe you
I wanna be you
I believe you
I wanna be you
I know you're not through with it yet
it's a big decision
you can't kick when you're down
the chromium car reflects who you are taking you home
I'm under you're spell can't you tell? don't you know?
God, people wonder if you're sick
spilled out on the city slick
puffed up like a macho jerk
don't even try it it'll never work
why you wonder? what you wonder for me?
why you wonder? what you wonder for me?
why you want what i can not be you know I won't stay sober
I believe you
I wanna be you
I believe you
I wanna be you
I know you're not through with it yet
it's a big decision
I know you're not through with it yet
it's a big decision
I know you're not through with it yet
it's a big decision
you can't kick when you're down
