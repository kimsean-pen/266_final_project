I've got a word of thanks
Thanks that I'd like to say
For the rage that I feel
For the rage that I feel today

Gotta stack, gotta stack
Stack of chips on my shoulder
In everything I do, 'cause I made, I made, I made
The mistake the mistake of trusting you

People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel

Yeah my layers are thick
And I got a bad attitude
Yeah that knife in my back
Has fingerprints that belong to you

Gotta grudge gotta grudge gotta grudge
That I'm holding for as long as I live
'Cause you lied, you lied, you lied
And that's something that I can't forgive

People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel my fire
Oh, people like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel

Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar

People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel my fire
Oh, people like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel

Liar, liar, you liar, you liar, liar

People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel
