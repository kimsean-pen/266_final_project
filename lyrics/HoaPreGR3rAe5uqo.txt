I know, I know
When you're sleeping
'Cause I scroll and don't see new anything
Silent, silent
Are you breathing?
How do I know if you're alive
If I can't see you seething?

But if we stretch our mind
Maybe then we won't ask why

We can freak out
We can freak out
Can I sleep on your couch?
And we can freak out

See through, see though
I seep into you
When you bite and your tongue gives more blood
And your mouth you will taste
Now you're cracking my knuckles
And your scratching my elbow
And it's with my voice you shout
Do colours look different now?

We can freak out
We can freak out
Can I sleep on your couch?
And we can freak out
We can freak out
We can freak out

Close your eyes, you don't need to see me
Focus on the heat and the weight of the gravity
Your hips, lips sliding front and back
And the tickle of the spiders crawling up your back

Close your eyes, you don't need to see me
Focus on the heat and the weight of the gravity
Your hips, lips sliding front and back
Spiders crawling up your back

We can freak out
We can freak out
Can I sleep on your couch?
And we can freak out
We can freak out, out
