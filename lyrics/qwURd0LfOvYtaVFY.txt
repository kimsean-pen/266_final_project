You say I only hear what I want to
You say I talk so all the time, so

And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong
'cause I missed you
Yeah, yeah, I missed you

And you say I only hear what I want to
I don't listen hard
Don't pay attention to the distance that you're running
To anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative, no, no, no

So I, I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up
And this woman was singing my song
Lover's in love and the other's run away
Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay

Some of us hover when we weep for the
other who was dying since the day they were born
Well, well, this is not that
I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown

And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
But that won't take me anyhow or anywhere with you

You said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong
I thought, "Hey, I can leave, I can leave"
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong
'cause I missed you
Yeah, I miss you

You said you caught you 'cause you
want me and one day you'll let me go
You'll try to give away a keeper or keep me
'cause you know you're just so scared to lose
And you say, "Stay"
And you say I only hear what I want to
