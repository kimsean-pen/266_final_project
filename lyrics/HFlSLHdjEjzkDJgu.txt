There you are alone,
With no hope of ever having.
Something to be proud of,
Something earned without begging.
Yes, I know you're a person,

A person close to me.
Who do think you are?
And what do you want from me?

Ball tongue!
You got the dykes off I think they'll mind me!
Ball tongue!
The rag I'm on, we are justified!

Ball tongue!
Congrats you just fucked up my make-up and shit!
Ball tongue!
What have you done for me?

Why are you at home,
Buried in your self pity?
Why do you insist on,
Living the life clean out of me?
Yes, I know you're the person,
The person that took time with me.
Does it give you the right to expect,
Your life revolves around me?

Ball tongue!
You have come to take from your buddy!
Ball tongue!
You have never been so funky!
Ball tongue!
The higgle got sick of me!

Ball tongue!
Ahh, the dick is fine for the day!
Ball tongue!
Your brother took it from me!

Ball tongue!
Unidentified enemy!
Ball tongue!
Come fucking back to save us,

And give up,
They've come to deliver me!

You were my brother.
Where does our friendship end?
You were my brother.
Where does our friendship end?
You were my brother.

Where does our friendship end?
You were my...
I'm not gonna give in.
You were my brother.
Where does our friendship end?
You were my brother.
Where does our friendship end?
You were my brother.
Where does our friendship end?
You were my...
I'm not gonna give in.
How can you fucking doubt me?
But not again.
How can you fucking doubt me?
But not again.
How can you fucking doubt me?

But not again.
How can you fucking doubt me?
But not again.
How can you fucking doubt me?
But not again.
How can you fucking doubt me?
But not again.
How can you fucking doubt me?

But not again.
How can you fucking doubt me?
But not again.

Ball tongue!
They've driven right by my friends!
Ball tongue!
They've taken the take above me!
Ball tongue!
And you're a psycho monkey!
Ball tongue!
They've come to enslave me!
Ball tongue!
They've jacked themselves onto me!
Ball tongue!
Your fucking gangster signs!
Ball tongue!
They've come not to same them but to take!
Ball tongue!
Fucking death to fucking me!
Ball tongue!
Jerome died at the technodrome!
Ball tongue!
You're right, he's dead, teargas dropped but who was it?
Ball tongue!
It doesn't take the rhythm of the damn monger!
Ball tongue!
Can I die, can I die?
Ball tongue!
And then, the men kept kicking me!
Ball tongue!
He gets them on, and they're cool!
Ball tongue!
He wasn't dead, and then they knocked him on top of the head!
Ball tongue!
No more, he's rid of you and you're a dyke!
