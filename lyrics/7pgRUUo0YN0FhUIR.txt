Never thought there were people like me,
Just a little bit dark we like it harder
Don't mind if the sky is grey,
You know we even kind of like it that way
Never knew it could feel like this
My thoughts are twisted, wrong and wicked...
Always knew that I wasn't the only one
I've found you - lets have some fun...
Calling me strange gives me confidence, cuz I take it as a compliment

Maybe I'll change my evil ways
Stop taking shots one of these days
I'll settle down, I'll rearrange
Maybe I'll learn from my mistakes
Stop breaking hearts, forgetting names
I'll settle down, and act my age
One of these days... but not today!

There came a point when everything clicked
And something snapped and that was that, yeah
My life was just beginning
Don't have to go on pretending
Always knew that I wasn't alone
I feel like I'm finally home...
Calling me strange gives me confidence, cuz I take it as a compliment

Maybe I'll change my evil ways
Stop taking shots one of these days
I'll settle down, I'll rearrange
Maybe I'll learn from my mistakes
Stop breaking hearts, forgetting names
I'll settle down, and act my age
One of these days... but not today!

I'll never change my evil ways, I kinda like my evil ways, I'll never change my evil ways, I'll never change!

I'll never change my evil ways,
Stop taking shots one of these days
I'll settle down, I'll rearrange
Maybe I'll learn from my mistakes
Stop breaking hearts, forgetting names
I'll settle down, and act my age
One of these days... but not today!

But not today!
