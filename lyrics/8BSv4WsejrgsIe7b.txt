Holocaust
behind the eyes of the heretics shaded visage
genocide
no longer repressed
pray to purge us of all our restraint
to bring about the end of days, the end of pain not so far away
[it's only foreplay]
wish upon the fallen star to wash away this new set of scars
[digging with the needle 'til we bloody the wrist]

forever gliding the light, guiding blind to sight and the sick to lust
forever gliding the light, guiding blind to sight and the sick to lust again

vexing this carcass needle the filth
the maggots eat away at our pain
stigmata nails bleeding the blackness
gilded, so silver thy serpent tongue
