They say there's no future for me
Locked in the tower I'll be
Until the day the hangman calls my name
The gallows pole stands straight and call

My thoughts turn to blackness I swear
This silence is too much to bear
Am I alone? Is someone calling me?
I must be strong, shed no more tears
Until it's time to die

I took the blame and sealed my fate
With words to the wise
How much longer must I wait
For death is my prize
Death is my prize

Subjected to torture and pain
I'll never see loved ones again
I no longer know what is and is not true
Agree to their lies is all that's left to do
Confession's extracted I'll bow my hand
Until it's time to die
Until it's time to die
Until it's time to die
