You've been around but you don't look too rough
And I still quite like some of your early stuff
It's bad in a good way if you know what I mean
The sound of those old machines

You've been around but you don't look too rough
And I still quite like some of your early stuff
You've been around but you don't look too rough
And I still quite like some of your early stuff

Suppose you're more or less retired now
I think I read somewhere how
You've written a book or a film score
Amazing that you lot come back for more

You've been around but you don't look too rough (Hey, what's your name?)
And I still quite like some of your early stuff
You've been around but you don't look too rough (Anyway, what's your name?)
And I still quite like some of your early stuff

Those old videos look pretty funny
What's in it for you now, need the money?
They say that management never used to pay
Honestly, you were ripped off back in the day

Hey, what's your name?
Anyway, what's your name?

You've been around but you don't look too rough (Hey, what's your name?)
And I still quite like some of your early stuff
You've been around but you don't look too rough (Anyway, what's your name?)
And I still quite like some of your early stuff

You've been around but you don't look too rough (Hey, what's your name?)
