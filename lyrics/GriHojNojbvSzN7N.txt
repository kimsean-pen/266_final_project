Well I wonderDo you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry

Well I wonder
Do you see me when we pass?
I half-die

Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind

Gasping but somehow still alive
This is the fierce last stand of all I am

Gasping, dying but somehow still alive
This is the final stand of all I am

Please keep me in mind
