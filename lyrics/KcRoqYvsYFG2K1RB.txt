Hope we can rely on you not to use shower...
You're not keeping tub caulked.
Caused both downstairs bath ceilings and walls to be soggy.
Tub has to properly caulked prior to any shower.
Walls are drenched -- I'll refer plumber here.
Had to pay for two service calls.
Water drips from all around.
Kathy's ceiling, my ceiling.
Don't use shower... don't use shower...
