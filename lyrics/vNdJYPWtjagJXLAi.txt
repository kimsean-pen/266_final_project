Dark, from the shadow
Come black forces so profane
Hidden current, the opposer
He who sits at the left
Source of power, lord of death
Carnal master, lord of life
Infernal blackest light
Will be burning throne of lies

Slaves of the southern cross
Exaltation of the lord below
Slaves of the southern cross
Adoration of the shrines of Sodom
Slaves of the southern cross
Chalice of the un-divine

Knights Templar, trampled crosses
Worship of Baphomet
At the stake they burned
They paid with their lives

Slaves of the southern cross
Exaltation of the lord below
Slaves of the southern cross
Adoration of the shrines of Sodom
Slaves of the southern cross
Chalice of the un-divine

Antinomian currents in the realms of the forbidden
Gnostic embrace of inner god and beast
Fearless, I do not shun the path of the perversion
Carnal transcendence in lustful apostasy

Black witches on the sabbath
They praise the unholy
Black goat enchantress
Dark mistress on fire
Whip cracks, dark goddess
Screams of pleasure, screams of pain
Lilith lives on
Our mistress of the beast

Slaves of the southern cross
Exaltation of the lord below
Slaves of the southern cross
Adoration of the shrines of Sodom
Slaves of the southern cross
Chalice of the un-divine

From Samael and Lilith to Hekate, to Pan
Dionysian ecstasies and the coming over man
The unholy union of Babylon and beast
The crooked path of carnal alchemy
From the dark, from the shadow
Comes black power so profane
Hidden current, the opposer
He who sits at the left
