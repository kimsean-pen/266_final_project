Meet me here
On November 11th, come alone
Bring your mouth
And selective irreverence
We'll both see stars, just

ONE!
MORE!
Tongue!
Kiss before the sky, it falls
Out
From
This cloud we're hovering on
Kiss to send us off

A kiss to send us off
A kiss to send us off
...

Kill your doubt
With the coldest of weapons
Confidence
No more words
Just the sound of resplendent
Tongues colliding

ONE!
MORE!
Tongue!
Kiss before the sky, it falls
Out
From
This cloud we're hovering on
A kiss to send us off

kiss to send us off
A kiss to send us off!
A kiss to send us off
A kiss to send us off
A kiss to send us off!

Here I am, there you are
Oh, a wire connecting our hearts
Theres a string, and it's tied, to a kite
Theres a storm, in the sky
Now the clouds become electric
There you are, here I am
Could I
Have!

A kiss to send us off
A kiss to send us off
A kiss to send us off!
A kiss to send us off
A kiss to send us off
A kiss to send us off!
A kiss to send us off
A kiss to send us off
A kiss to send us off!
A kiss to send us off
A kiss to send us off
A kiss to send us off!
