Feel the vibe, feel the terror, feel the pain
It's driving me insane
I can't fake, for God's sakes
Why am I driving in the wrong lane?

Trouble is my middle name
But in the end I'm not too bad
Can someone tell me if it's wrong to be so mad about you?
Mad about you
Mad

Are you the fishy wine that will give me a headache in the morning?
Or just a dark blue landmine that
will explode without a decent warning?
Give me all your true hate and I'll translate it in our bed
Into never seen passion, never seen passion
That's why I am so mad about you
Mad about you
Mad

Trouble is your middle name
But in the end you're not too bad
Can someone tell me if it's wrong to be so mad about you?
Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad

Give me all your true hate
And I'll translate it in your bed
Into never seen passion
That is why I am so mad about you
Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad about you
