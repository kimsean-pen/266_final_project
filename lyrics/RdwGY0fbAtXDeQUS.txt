Broken blades are buried deep.
They can't be reached with my teeth.
Following my sorrow I feast on bone and marrow.
Obsess over heartbreak.
Perfect pain is pleasure.
No such thing as peace of mind.

The joyful can't be free.

There is no blinding light.
There is no reward.
Happiness is fleeting.
No stopping the bleeding.
Feed me to the leeches.
A bloody shred of hope.
A sliver of sunlight shines through the gore.
Is this all I get?
I want more.
