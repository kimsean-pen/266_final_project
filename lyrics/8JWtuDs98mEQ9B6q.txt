I drank some dirty water
Shook evil hands
I've done some bad things
And they get easier to do

And then I wrote a nasty letter
And I sent it to the Lord
I said don't you dare come
And bother me no more

Oh, oh, oh, oh

I had a good friend
I could only destroy
And lovers I loved less
Than anybody could afford

Yes, but this old rocking horse
Just nods his head
And he's gonna rock back and forth
The way that he always did

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Baby don't you bother
Tasting the water
And baby don't you bother
Coming closer to me

Yes, you see my eyes
They're half the size
And I'm not able
To look at you, no, no

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
