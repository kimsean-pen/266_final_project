Cut away from the shell of a life
I had found myself wandering into
Behind glass I was frozen like time
In a memory you can't get away from

Killing time, we're all just killing time
Going out every night to feel fine
This chemical courage and positive lines
Against all of the things that we're trying to hide

I should have listened to you when you said
Nothing will make this easier
I should have listened to you when you said
Running won't get you away from this
It follows wherever I go
It follows wherever I go

Worried mind like a camera lens
With no clarity left for the picture
Filter out what I want to forget
Wipe away all the names and the faces

I should have listened to you when you said
Nothing will make this easier
I should have listened to you when you said
Running won't get you away from this
It follows wherever I go
It follows wherever I go

Breathing in slow
Breathing out and letting go
Breathing in slow
Breathing out and letting go
Breathing in slow
Breathing out and letting go
Breathing in slow
Breathing out and letting go
Breathing in slow
Breathing out and letting go
Breathing in slow
Breathing out and letting go
