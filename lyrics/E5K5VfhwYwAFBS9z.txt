I know it feel it flow
I see it grow, I see you low
Hello, too low...?
I know to feel it more
To feel it more, feel it more
Than more...
I feel it more to feel it more
It ain't about yourself get out of yourself
Push it on out of yourself right out of sight
You got a big surprise coming your way
Push it on all out, move it
Push it. Push it
It ain't about yourself get out of yourself
Go check it out
It's coming...
