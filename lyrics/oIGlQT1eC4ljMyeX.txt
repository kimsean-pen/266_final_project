There is no woman
There is no drug
There's no amount of money or fun
No conversation that I could have
No entertainment that could distract
Me from the voice that's always in my ear
That's always tellin' me it doesn't matter
Everywhere I go it's all I hear
And it can hurt my head, but it can sound so sweet
Wondering if I'm awake
Maybe I'm dreaming
Well how could I tell anyway?
Try and define what was here today
But then I know I can't believe my eyes
How can I tell you're in front of me?
And not a shadow made up in my mind
I think I need it
I know I don't
I wanna drink and
I wanna smoke
I wanna kiss and take off your dress
If it's not one thing, then it's the next
Think that I'm using to get through the day
That keeps me staring in the wrong direction
And if I only ever look one way
Then I can miss some things I might have liked to see
Wondering if I'm awake
Maybe I'm dreaming
Well how could I tell anyway?
Try and define what was here today
But then I know I can't believe my eyes
How can I tell you're in front of me?
And not a shadow made up in my mind
I built them up then they all fell down
One at a time 'til they laid on the floor
I know they'll be eventually run down
And when it's gone, I'll be looking for more
I built these walls up around myself
They're not as safe as I thought that they were
I built them up then they all fell down
It was the prettiest sound that I ever heard
