You went and put salt in my drink
Now I'm cross, you got nothing to say
You give me the gun and I think I'm a mess
And I need you to stay

Why must I be the angry one
I won't cry, fine line between our love
I can't speak but you ask
What have I done?

Sit outside from this ring system cover me in dust
Where magic lies with a fool's wisdom just below the cross
I faction you to lay your soul on mystic death wars
To bring the songs of cherubim
Into your empty head

And if our rapport is so sour
You're a big bank and I owe you
I'll take your silence as a sign
You're a big shot but who needs who?

Why must I be the angry one
I won't cry, fine line between our love
I can't speak but you ask
What have I done?

Sit outside from this ring system cover me in dust
Where magic lies with a fool's wisdom just below the cross
I faction you to lay your soul on mystic death wars
To bring the songs of cherubim
Into your empty head

Sit outside from this ring system cover me in dust
Where magic lies with a fool's wisdom just below the cross
I faction you to lay your soul on mystic death wars
To bring the songs of cherubim
Into your empty head
