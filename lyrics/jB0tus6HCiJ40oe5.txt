I like people who are wrong
could you then feel like I do
Collossus bestrides the haves and have nots
go softly this is being sung for you

wake up wake up
the wish you made is plucked
go out get up
you've done enough enough
wake up wake up
to take the time to cuss
go out get up
you've seen enough enough

do you think that you deserve it?

I am waiting here for you
looking out across the brooke
my hands resting on my chest
but still I stare into the night

wake up wake up
the wish you made is plucked
go out get up
you've done enough enough
wake up wake up
to take the time to cuss
go out get up
you've seen enough enough

when the fox hears the rabbit cry
he comes running but not to help
