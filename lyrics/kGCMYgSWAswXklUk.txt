Sweet life livin'
Pools and swimming
Drinks in bars and
Boys in cars and
Rooftop sitting
Skinny dipping
Shooting stars with you
Fat cigars and

That weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands

I was just tryna be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?

Mansion debut
Love it, do you?
Absent father
Pays his daughter
And her mama withdrew
From the life they once knew
She had a heart, but
She sold it off for

That weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands

I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?

But nothing is feeling right
I drink but I choke
I love but I don't, yeah
I was just tryna be cool
I was just tryna be like you

I was just tryna be cool
I was just tryna be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?

Well, I've got that cigarette smoke
And Saint Laurent coat
But nothing is feeling right
I drink but I choke
I love but I don't, yeah
I was just tryna be cool
I was just tryna be like you
