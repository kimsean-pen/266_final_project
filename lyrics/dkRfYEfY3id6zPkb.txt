Bury me in your clever words
Head down following the herd
Everybody's fool walking a straight line
Enemy so sly and serpentine
(Pre Coro)
And so on we go
Into the corners of your mind
Another lost in time
Caught beneath the Landslide
Landslide
(Verso)
Comfort me with your broken smile
Suffer me a life that's in denial
You've come to break the mold
Your story's all been told
But your heart lies
In the darkness of your soul
(Pre Coro)
And so on we go
Into the corners of your mind
A brother lost in time
Oh!
Caught beneath the Landslide
Landslide
How can we fight with our hands tied
Caught beneath the Landslide
(Verso)
Waiting for the sunrise to cross into the light
But tonight I'm taking what is mine
(Solo)
Landslide
Landslide
How can we fight with our hands tied
Beneath the Landslide
(Coro Final)
Caught beneath the Landslide
Cross into the light
Landslide
Read between the lines
Landslide
Cross into the light
How can we fight with our hands tied
Read between the lines
Landslide
Cross into the light
Read between the lines
