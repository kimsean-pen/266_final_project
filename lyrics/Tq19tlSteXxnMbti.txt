You say these nights
Got you feeling some way
You say
I should come around your way
You heard I'm a savage
Have a few things on the low
And I heard You're about it
Tell me when you really want to go
Ah Yeah
I'm on the way off the yack
Long Ts with the capes in the back
Back thing with her face and her ass
I sit back while she shaking her ass
Yeah Ah
I got the digi in the dash
Rolling down the road
Pressing on the gas
Only gonna ask for tonight
It's only gonna last for tonight
Came through like ayy ayy ayy
Bottle in my hand and a whole lot of bands
Okay ayy ayy
So up right now

Some say that we in here

Some say that we bout that life
Some say that we run these nights
Some say that we went too high
Some say some say
Some say that I fucked your bitch
Some say that we young and rich
Some say that my mind gets sick
Adderall pills on a vodka diet
some say I should watch my manners
I don't have time you can check my planner
Some say she a private dancer

And her favorite song Panda
These night got you feeling some way
