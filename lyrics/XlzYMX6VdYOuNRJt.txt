It's a really new way you hold your head
It's like insanity is hanging on a thread
The flesh feels cold underneath your nails
And the look you give me never fails, never fails

I love the way you hurt me
I love that you don't care
My love is dark and twisted
And I scream when you're not there

It's the interesting way you pierce my brain
It's within my urges but never the same
I love it when you help me, you crack a smile
The best is when you make it last a while, last it a while

I love the way you hurt me
I love that you don't care
My love is dark and twisted
And I scream when you're not there

Can't seem to get away, this ghost I'll never find
It haunts me till this day, I can't get back my mind

I love the way you hurt me
I love that you don't care
My love is dark and twisted
And I scream when you're not there
