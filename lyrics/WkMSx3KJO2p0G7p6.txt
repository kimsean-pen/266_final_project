What's it like our there?
Is it personal?
It is the machine if you'd like to put it that way,
that has created you.
(In the beginning) there was only darkness everywhere,
darkness and water.
There's no light without darkness.
In the beginning there was only the
great self, reflected in the form of a person.
Matter and spirit.
Reflecting it found nothing but itself.
Body and mind, and soul is what unifies
(This, the mind.)
Soul knows that I'm capable of evil.
