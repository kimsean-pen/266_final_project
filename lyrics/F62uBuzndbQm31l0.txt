you may not think so man
but that boy he's just like me.
he likes dogs and he likes bicycles
and like everyone else in this town
he chasing his dream.
when my front end fell out
it flashed out cross the b.q.e.
the only thing i could care about
were my cds and my weed.
so i ditched the plates
ran my a towards the l.i.e.
and i caught a pair of headlights:
my buddy messina flaggin down on me.

and I'm not the biggest scumbag you'll ever meet
and yeah man all my bridges are hangin from a string:
thin like a fishing line, like the type of string
that keeps this whole d city together.
and I'm a live wire
and i can't fight this feeling any longer

yeah someday i'll go back to school
and oneday i'll pay you your money back.

and oneday man
you gotta realize
that all these ideas
we bought em all.
and then calm down,
your just growin old.
so let's hold this close
and we'll fall back to whats ours
i've got enough pills
to last us both a couple of hours
and we'll count our stars it won't come to soon.

I'm on fire now i feel alright
like i've been wanting to write home
wanted to tell mom
"everybodies fine"
soul singers got me singin'
man this s gets to me
same way it got to you
and so on
