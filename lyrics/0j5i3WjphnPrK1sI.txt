Tired of living in the modern world
Another casual flag left unfurled by love
Tired of living inside my mind
Another casualty out of time for us

Faith Hope Love,
Be Enough

Tired of living in this modern land
Too many ideals to meet with its demands
Tired Of looking for sympathy
Got to learn to stand on my own two feet

Faith Hope Love,
(Too Much too soon, To see it through, look back at your life with some kind of pride)
Be Enough

If I ever let you down,
Would you ever feel the ground?

Faith Hope Love,
(Too Much too soon, To see it through, look back at your life with some kind of pride)
Be Enough
