Taxi ride
Going down town
Me and my girls
Going out
Counting down
To detonation
Ten to zero
Mushroom cloud

Little angel
I've been too good
Ditch the halo for a while
Dressed to kill
I'll be causing
Mass destruction
So shield your eyes
I'm all steamed up
And ready to blow
Pressure max
Meter red overload
To get release
I gotta explode
Explode

I'm a bomb
Can you hear me tick?
Beware if you turn me on
There is no safety switch
I'm a bomb
Use only steady hands
To mess with me
You must be a brave man
I'm a bomb
I'm a bomb

Bass so loud
I can't hear you
Can't defuse me
Now I'm wired
Do not disturb
While I'm dancing
Watch me set this
House on fire

I'm a bomb
Can you hear me tick?
Beware if you turn me on
There is no safety switch
I'm a bomb
Use only steady hands
To mess with me
You must be a brave man
I'm a bomb
Can you hear me tick?
Beware if you turn me on
There is no safety switch
I'm a bomb
Use only steady hands
To mess with me
You must be a brave man

Club crescendo
Getting loud
Run for cover
Underground
what are you doing
Showing me no fear
You must be crazy
Hanging 'round here

I'm all steamed up
And ready to blow
Pressure max
Meter red overload
To get release
I gotta explode
Explode

I'm a bomb
Can you hear me tick?
Beware if you turn me on
There is no safety switch
I'm a bomb
Use only steady hands
To mess with me
You must be a brave man
I'm a bomb
Can you hear me tick?
Beware if you turn me on
There is no safety switch
I'm a bomb
Use only steady hands
To mess with me
You must be a brave man
I'm a bomb
I'm a bomb
