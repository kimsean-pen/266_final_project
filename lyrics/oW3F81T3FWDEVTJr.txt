Loving and fighting
Accusing and denying
I can't imagine a world with you gone
The joy and the chaos
The demons we're made of
I'd be so lost if you left me alone
You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you and feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming please don't leave me?

Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make you right
I swear to love you're all my life
Hold on I still need you

Long in this highway
Silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying
The light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in and feel your heartbeat
Can you here me screaming: "Please don't leave me"?

Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make you right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on I still need you
I don't wanna let go
I know I'm not that strong
I just wanna hear you say baby let's go home
Let's go home
Yeah, I just wanna take you home
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
