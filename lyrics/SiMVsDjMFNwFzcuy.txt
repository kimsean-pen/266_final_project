I never wanted it to be this way, I thought I loved her
And it's hard for me to say, but I found another
And you're probably thinking this would last forever
If I could take back time and change my mind
It would end up differently

She's so bad for me, and I can't help it
It's so hard to see a way around it
Said she's gonna call, and nothing at all
Inch by inch, I got my back to the wall
'Cause she's so bad for me, and I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it

And I know it didn't take much time for me to move on
Endless fights and restless nights, but the days felt so long
And I might've thought that we could last forever
But I'm just fine and took my time, and things fit perfectly

She's so bad for me, and I can't help it
It's so hard to see a way around it
Said she's gonna call, and nothing at all
Inch by inch, I got my back to the wall
'Cause she's so bad for me, and I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it

Guess you probably never saw this coming
It's too late, I'm sorry, darling
I'm moving on to better things
You're a distant memory now, yeah
She's so bad for me, and I can't help it
It's so hard to see a way around it

She's so bad for me, and I can't help it
It's so hard to see a way around it
Said she's gonna call, and nothing at all
Inch by inch, I got my back to the wall
'Cause she's so bad for me, and I can't help it

I can't help it
I can't help it
