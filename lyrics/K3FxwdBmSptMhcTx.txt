Sleep comes to everyone
While we wait for the Sunday afternoons
Sleep comes to everyone
Everyone maybe yeah, but you

Sleep comes to everyone
While we wait, wide awake and blue
Sleep comes to everyone
Everyone maybe, yeah, but me and you

And so I give myself away
To everybody everyday
And so I give myself to you
And you need it more than I do

And so I give myself away
Unto everybody everyday
And so I give myself to you
And you need it more than I do

Sleep comes to everyone
While we wait for the Sunday afternoons
And sleep comes to everyone
Everyone maybe, yeah, but you

And I had this one figured out
That's why the suicide machine is built for two
A simple sick device devised to overload on love
To bring us colored dreams and sound tracked waves of fun

And so I give myself away
To everybody everyday
And so I give myself to you
And you need it more than I do

So I give myself away
To everybody everyday
And so I give myself to you
And you need it more than I do

Sleep comes to no one else like we have
Falling through the ground
Fulfilling promises of endless summer nights
I'm losing ground, you're losing sound

Somewhere through a thousand blues
A dragonfly descends with just a whisper, "I'm lonelier than God"
And all my wishes spin the fishes in the air and every one
A different shade of you

And to the left where up is down
Now stands a zebra made of shapes of me
And silver and the sun
So bring no guilt with you up above the flat-line
Let's just hit the sky exploding into one

I need you
I need you
I need you
