It's a coin toss
It's a game on
You were born lost
And dirt blonde

No curfew
With your drunk mum
No one to stop you now

And I'll give you my opinion, it's the only one I got
They'll turn you into something, whether you are it or not

But they'll never get you right
I've been watching you all night
And the people passing by
They should tremble at your sight

Oh these bad dreams, and back seats
High beams through the dark streets
Good angels, with bad wings
No one to help you out

And I'll give you my opinion, it's the only one I got
They'll turn you into something, whether you are it or not

Through a microscope lens, dissecting your whole life

But they'll never get you right
I've been watching you all night
And the people passing by
They should tremble at your sight

But they'll never get you right
I've been watching you all night
And the people passing by
They should tremble at your sight

But they'll never get you right

Everybody talks from their own side of the mask
Gliding through the universe, as the world goes rolling past
Don't give into the pressure, 'cause it isn't gonna stop
The world goes on around you, whether you like it or not

But they'll never get you right
I've been watching you all night
And the people passing by you
They should tremble at your sight
They'll never get you right
(Get you right)
And they're never gonna get you right
(Get you right)
And they're never gonna get you right
(Get you right)
And they're never gonna get you right
