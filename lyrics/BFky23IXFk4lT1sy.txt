It's too late, too late to be awake
It goes on and on with every breath I take
Grass will grow and hearts will break
It goes on and on with every breath I take

I'm running in circles, I'm losing it all
From something to nothing, do the right thing, let me fall
You're pushing me sideways but you won't let go
And I know you're sorry but do the right thing
Cut the rope and let me fall

It's too late, too late to make mistakes
All flowed with all of my games
Tired and slow to erase the pain
But it goes on and on with every breath I take

I'm running in circles, I'm losing it all
From something to nothing, do the right thing, let me fall
You're pushing me sideways but you won't let go
And I know you're sorry but do the right thing
Cut the rope and let me fall

Roses to the flame
My love always turns to blame
And it's never enough, no, no, no, no

I'm running in circles, I'm losing it all
From something to nothing, do the right thing, let me fall
You're pushing me sideways but you won't let go
And I know you're sorry but do the right thing
Cut the rope and let me fall

Cut the rope and let me fall
Cut the rope and let me fall
Cut the rope and let me fall
Cut the rope and let me fall
