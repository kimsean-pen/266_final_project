We all got secrets
We try to hide them
Leave them in the cellar
Gathering dust, hm hm
We covert he weak bits
Show only the good sites
But I don't want this
It's gotta feel right

So let's build a house
Starting with the ground
If we work together
We can work it out
In the loudest storm
We can be so proud
(Woh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh)

'Cause it won't break down
It won't break down
'Cause it won't break down

Let's pile up the bricks, take
The weight from our shoulders
A house can be shaken
But I want you to know love
I'll make a promise
I swear on our lifes
This roof will hold us
As long as we're alive

So let's build a house
Starting with the ground
If we work together
We can work it out
In the loudest storm
We can be so proud
(Woh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh)

'Cause it won't break down
It won't break down
(It won't break down)

And all the cracks and
All the scars
Make us stronger
And who we are
And when the winds
Come rolling in
They'll hear us sing

'Cause we won't break down
It won't break down

So let's build a house
Starting with the ground
If we work together
We can work it out
In the loudest storm
We can be so proud, so proud

'Cause it won't break down
