Ooh ooh ooh

What am I doing?
Still in this little room smokin'
I'm still a kid on the moon
Watching those lives and learning
Who am I really?
26 and still searching
Oh wait I know, oh wait I know
But this other me is again living
I'm blessed
But I'm not really aware of it
We're all blessed enough

But we don't really care about it

What's wrong, what's right?
And which side is my body standing?
Is your way mine?
And is mine and yours fitting?
Wanting more
But seeing myself disappearing
Playing those same two chords
Whatever that's what I would have done as a kid
I'm blessed
We're all blessed

I'm blessed
We're all blessed

Oooh

Oooh
Oooh
Oooh

I'm blessed
But I'm not really aware of it
We're all blessed enough
But we don't really care about it

I'm blessed
But I'm not really aware of it
We're all blessed enough
But we don't really care about it

Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
