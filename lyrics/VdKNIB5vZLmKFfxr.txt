I need to be
cleansed
It's time to make
amends

For all of the
fun
The damage is
done

I feel
diseased
I'm down on my
knees

I need
forgiveness
Someone
to bear witness

To the goodness
within
Beneath the
sin
Although I may
flirt
With all kinds of
dirt
To the point of
disease
Now
I want release
All this decay
Take it
away
Somewhere
There's someone who
cares
With a heart of gold
To have and to hold
