Cast open the window, rip down the blinds
I'm sick of hidin' from the sweet sunshine
'Cause it ain't, it ain't gettin' me nowhere
I've been locked up in this house for way too long
I'm sittin' around singin' sad, sad songs
And it ain't, it ain't gettin' me nowhere

It's been a long time comin'
I'm jumpin' off this reckless pitty train
Oh, I'm all cashed out on your lovin'
I've paid my dues honey, you can keep the change

Well, I know how to nurse a bad heartache
I can make it worse when I wanna feel the pain
But it ain't, it ain't gettin' me nowhere
I know how to cry a river, I know how to drown
Put that anchor 'round my ankles and let it take me down
But it ain't, it ain't gettin' me nowhere

It's been a long time comin'
I'm jumpin' off this reckless pity train
Oh, I'm all cashed out on your lovin'
Yeah, I've paid my dues honey, you can keep the change

Keep the change, keep the change
Keep the change, keep the change

Oh, it's been a long time comin'
I'm jumpin' off this reckless pitty train
Yeah, I'm all cashed out on your lovin'
Yeah, I've paid my dues honey, you can keep the change
Yeah, I've paid my dues honey, you can keep the change
