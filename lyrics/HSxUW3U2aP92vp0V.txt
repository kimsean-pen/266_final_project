So many feelings
Pent up in here
Left all alone, I'm with
The one I most fear.

I'm sick and I'm tired
Of reasoning;
Just want to break out,
Shake off this skin.

I, I can't
Escape myself.

All my problems
Loom larger than life
I can't swallow
Another slice.

Seems like my shadow
Mocks every stride.
I learn to live with
What's trapped inside?
