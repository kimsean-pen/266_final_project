Sometimes I feel like
I'm a bird with broken wings
At times I dread my now
And envy where I've been

But that's when
Quiet wisdom takes control
At least I've got a story
No one's told
I finally learned to say
Whatever will be will be
I've learned to take
The good, the bad and breathe

'Cause although we like
To know what life's got planned
No one knows if shooting stars will land
These days it feels naive

To put your faith in hope

To imitate a child
Falling backwards on the snow
'Cause that's when fears will
Usually lead you blind

But now I try to under-analyze
I finally learned to say
Whatever will be will be
I've learned to take
The good, the bad and breathe

'Cause although we like
To know what life's got planned
No one knows if shooting stars will land

Is the rope I walk wearing thin?
Is the life I love caving in?
Is the weight on your mind
A heavy black bird caged inside?
Say whatever will be will be
Take the good, the bad
Just breathe
'Cause although we like
To know what life's got planned
No one knows if shooting stars will land
I finally learned to say
Whatever will be will be
And I have learned to take
The good, the bad and breathe
'Cause although we like
To know what life's got planned
Things like that are never in your hands
No one knows if shooting stars will land
