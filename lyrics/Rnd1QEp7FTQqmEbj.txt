You've got secrets, oh yeah
And I've got a weakness for them
No this ain't the time or place to show your face
'Cause you know that I can't stand the need to get even.

Tonight, when everything you say won't come out right
So I'll try to save some face, and take my space
Till the times right
Cause we'll need it.

So I surrender, I can't forget her.
Will you remember the truth?
Cause they won't even want me to
Wish you would read this

Oh yeah and know that I meant it. I did
Yeah I could fill every page with all my ways
That I tried to understand
Wish things could be different.

Alright, well it ain't for lack of how I tried.
So let's go our separate ways
And count the days as we get by.
Cause we'll get by.

So I surrender, I can't forget her.
Will you remember the truth?
Cause they won't even want me to
So I surrender, I can't forget her

Will you remember the truth?
This'll drag on and on and on
Where I'm the only one who's wrong
It's always somethin', it's always somethin' with me and you.

This'll drag on and on and on
Where I'm the only one who's wrong
It's always somethin', it's always somethin' with me and you.
So I surrender, so I surrender.

So I surrender
I can't forget her
Will you remember the truth?

Cause they won't even want me to.
They won't even want me to, so I surrender.
So I surrender!
