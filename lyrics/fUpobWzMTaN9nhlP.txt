Well nighttime passes
but the dark remains
And I was feelin' like a little child
but I am loathe to place blame
On that lioness woman
who will go here unnamed
She was looking in me for a lion
when she found it so tame.
On that erstwhile may morning
I took the six downtown to Spring
and I was writing something elegiac
that I never learned to sing
But I think it was this song
just four years premature
and I remember crossing out the line
All is fair in love and war

Well if all is fair in love and war
then I don't know what we are fighting for
Cuz my baby she's a real peach
even when the night come crashin' down
Real peach
and the nighttime rolls away, alright
And we're comin' back to the demon-killing work of love
(my god)
Well nighttime passes
and the dark retreats
I hand it over to my upper angel
who visits me in sleep
we're in the field beyond the right and wrong
and the fallacy of form
Well you can call it what you wanna call it
I just say "All is fair in love and war"
Well if all is fair in love and war
then I don't know what we are fighting for
So if we don't care
to fight no more
let's go upstairs and let's shut the door

Cuz my baby she's a real peach
even when the night come crashing down
Real peach
and the nighttime rolls away, alright
Cuz my baby she's a real peach
even when the night come crashing down
Real peach
and the nighttime rolls away, alright
and we're comin' back to the demon killing work of love
(my god)
