This is a cry out
To the ones in the gutter
To the sorry unfaithful
We lonely few
We band with others
We stand apart
In a trial by fire
We'll make it through
There is hope for us yet
We can die like the heroes before us
Or live to be the wicked ones
The wicked ones we're running from
Nobody's gonna believe
When you say you're turning the page
Cause you never put up a real fight
So shut up and make it right
Shut up and make it right
Singing "oh, take cover, take cover"
Singing "oh, take cover, take cover"
Secrets don't make friends
We make love, and love falls apart
Singing "oh take cover"
From our future hearts
Here comes the fall out
The trouble and clutter
The madness of millions
If we only knew
Surely there would be
Some kind of redemption
A trial by fire
To pull us through
Nobody's gonna believe
When you say you're turning the page
Cause you never put up a real fight
So shut up and make it right
Shut up and make it right
Singing "oh, take cover, take cover"
Singing "oh, take cover, take cover"
Secrets don't make friends
We make love, and love falls apart
Singing "oh take cover"
From our future hearts
Secrets don't make friends
We make love, and love falls apart
Tell me when the party ends
And take cover from our future hearts
Singing "oh, take cover, take cover"
Singing "oh, take cover, take cover"
Secrets don't make friends
We make love, and love falls apart
Singing "oh take cover"
From our future hearts
Tell me when the party ends
And take cover from our future hearts
Singing "oh, take cover, take cover"
