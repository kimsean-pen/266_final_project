Supremacy b*tch!
Temitemishou
Densetsu no Supremacy
Yottsu no nokinamikunai kara

Kono ii desu nai kara
Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you

Public display of affection
Feel's like no one else in the room (but you)
We can get down like there's no one around
We'll keep on rockin' (We'll keep on rockin')

We'll keep on rockin' (Keep on rockin')

Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watchin' (They keep watchin')
Keep watchin
Feels like the crowd is saying
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme

Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme

Center of attention (Can you feel that?)
Even when we're up against the wall
You got me in a crazy position (Yeah)
If you're on a mission (Uh-uh)
You got my permission (Oh)
We can get down like there's no one around
We'll keep on rockin' (Keep on rockin')
We'll keep on rockin', rockin' (Oh ah ha)
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watchin' (Wait)
Keep watchin
Feels like the crowd is saying
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme
