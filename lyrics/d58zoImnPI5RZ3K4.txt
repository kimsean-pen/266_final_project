I know I know I should be better, think I am to some degree
I can't explain why it gets harder the more people count on me
Maybe it's all in my head and nothin's changed
And I'm still in the basement with no tattoos and mortgage payments

Well I'm not so good with tenses, I'm tensin up thinkin about
What I'm supposed to call you now
Well it takes a lot to shake me and my body breaks to figure out
How to leave the past behind when it's around all of the time
And I don't know what I should call you now
I don't know what I should call you now

I don't believe that anyone runs from their past so easily
Unless they run towards someone else
and I've seen you lacin' up for years
I'd guess your future looks great well good for you
You're still my inspiration, we're less in tune and more abrasive

And I'm not so good with tenses
I'm tensin up thinkin about what I'm supposed to call you now
And it takes a lot to shake me, my body breaks to figure out
How to leave the past behind when it's around all of the time
And I don't know what I should call you now
I don't know what I should call you now

Ex sounds dirty I can't say it, sounds so final and I'm still prayin
For the worst for the better, we're nothing now we're just two letters
Hope you understand I'm not prepared to call you just a friend

I'm not so good with tenses
I'm tensin up thinkin' about what I'm supposed to call you now

I'm not so good with tenses
I'm tensin' up thinkin' about what I'm supposed to call you now

And I'm not so good with tenses
I'm tensin' up thinkin' about what I'm supposed to call you now
And it takes a lot to shake me and my body breaks to figure out
How to leave the past behind when it's around all of the time
And I don't know what I should call you
I don't know what I should call you
I don't know what I should call you now
