Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment
Make it last forever

Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ahhh

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk till we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Leather black and eyes of blue (Blue, blue, blue)
Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger

So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
Let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ahhh

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk till we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Ohhh, you're cold as ice, baby
But when you're nice, baby
You're so amazing in every way
Ohhh, you're cold as ice, baby
I don't wanna fight, baby
It's like I told you; If you stay, I'll stay (Yeah)

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk till we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Hmmm-hmmm-mmmm
