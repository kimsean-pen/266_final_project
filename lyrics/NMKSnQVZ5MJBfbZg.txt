i know this not remain forever
how ever it's beautiful
your eyes hands and your warm smile
they're my treasure
it's hard to forget
i wish there was solution
don't speand your time in cofusion
i will turn back and spread

my broken wings
still strong enough to cross the ocean with
my broken wings
how far shoul'd i've gone drifting in the wind
higher and higher in the skyes
my broken wings
still strong enough to cross the ocean with
my broken wings
how far shoul'd i've gone drifting in the wind
across the sky just keep on flying

sora kara achitekuru no wa are wa ame de wa hakute
do you ever change your time to my heart
because it's afraid of you
now i could't help then in longer
love it's no a toy let go of me now
the time spead it's perfection
my futur it's not real so leaving to the air

my broken wings
still strong enough to cross the ocean with
my broken wings
how far shoul'd i've gone drifting in the wind
higher and higher in the skyes
my broken wings
still strong enough to cross the ocean with
my broken wings
how far shoul'd i've gone drifting in the wind
across the sky just keep on flying
sora kara achitekuru no wa are wa ame de wa hakute
