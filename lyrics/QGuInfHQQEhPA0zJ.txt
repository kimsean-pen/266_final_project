If I go hard, let me tell you that it's worth it
Play the right cards, I ain't afraid to work it
Brush 'em right off when they say I don't deserve it
Hands on my heart, you, you keep my fire burning

Ooh it feels so crazy when you scream my name
Love it when you rock me over every day
When I think about it I could go insane
Here we are it's beautiful, I'm blown away

If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild

If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild

When it gets rough, then the rain starts pouring
I turn up the heat 'cause the drama ain't important
Let 'em all talk, talk I'mma just ignore it
Hands on my heart, you, you keep me moving forward
Ooh it feels so crazy when you scream my name

Never when you rock me everyday
When I think about it I, I goin' insane
Here we are, it's beatiful, I'm blown away

If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild

If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild
Wild, wild, wild (wild) woah
Wild, wild, wild (wild) woah oh oh

I'm so intrigued by the way you look
Wish I could stay underneath your touch
Forever you will be by my side
I'm not afraid, I've running wild

If this is a dream, won't open my eyes,
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild

If this is a dream, won't open my eyes,
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild
Wild, wild, wild (wild) woah
Wild, wild, wild (wild) (J,J,J-Jessie J) woah oh oh
Wild, wild, wild (wild) woah
Wild, wild, wild (wild) woah
