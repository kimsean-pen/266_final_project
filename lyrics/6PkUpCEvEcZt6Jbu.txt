Stealing Glances at the pavement
The weight it comes too soon
Supposed to keep on rolling
But the race is nothing new

As the train, it starts to go,
And it takes our bodies slow
And I know you wanted to for some time now

All this time you're gone
In your wake I stumble on
But the smoke is nothing that I haven't seen

So I walk into the sun
I thought you'd be there
But you could fool anyone
In the red water dust
Will I see you soon,
Or did we move on?

The crowd begins to break up
They're calling their goodbyes
My head's above the water
But I'm drowning in your eyes
So I walk into the sun

I thought you'd be there
But you could fool anyone
Got a head full of dust
Will I see you soon,
Or did we move on?
Well the race is long, you can't relax

And I don't belong so I'm headed back
It's getting hard, you feel the fear
I'm seeing red, wish you were here
And I walk into the sun
I thought you'd be there
But you could fool anyone
Got a head full of dust
Will I see you soon,
Or did we move?
Will I see you soon,
Or did we move on?
Will I see you soon,
Or do we move on?
