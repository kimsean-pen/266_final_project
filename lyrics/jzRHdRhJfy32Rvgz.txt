626 Bedford Avenue I think
I regret that night of kissing you
That night of kissing you
That night of kissing you

Baby lets have a conversation
And god forbid we have a connection
I'd like to know what you're thinking
'Cause I don't get near what I've been giving

626 Bedford Avenue I think
I regret that night of kissing you
I should have left when
You laughed at my shoes
(But I keep on coming back)
626 Stupid Avenue don't make
Me regret that night of kissing you
I fell in love, and you treat me like shit
(But I keep on coming back)

I don't think you're ready,
But I don't think you can forget me
Your insecurities are ruining
Everything that we could be
Get your head out of your ass
And take a good look at yourself

626 Bedford Avenue I think
I regret that night of kissing you
I should have left when
You laughed at my shoes
(But I keep on coming back)
626 Stupid Avenue don't make
Me regret that night of kissing you
I fell in love, and you treat me like shit

(But I keep on coming back)
(But I keep on coming back)
But I keep on coming back
But I keep on coming back
You might be a psychopath
You might wanna check that

626 Bedford Avenue I think
I regret that night of kissing you

You laughed at my shoes

626 Stupid Avenue don't make
Me regret that night of kissing you
I fell in love, and you treat me like shit
(But I keep on coming back)

But I keep on coming back
You might be a psychopath
You might wanna check that
