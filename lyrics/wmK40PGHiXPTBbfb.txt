It's like he doesn't hear a word I say
His mind is somewhere far away
And I don't know how to get there

It's like all he wants is to chill out (she's serious)
He makes me want to pull all my hair out
(She's always in a rush and interrupted)
Like he doesn't even care (like she doesn't even care)

You, me
We're face to face
But we don't see eye to eye

It's like fire and rain (it's like fire and rain)
You can drive me insane (you can drive me insane)
But I can't stay mad at you for anything

We're Venus and Mars (Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars (like different stars)
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a thing

She's always trying to save the day
Just want to hear my music play
She's all or nothing, but my feelings never change

Why, does he try to read my mind? (I try to read her mind)
It's like he tries to psychoanalyze
(She tries to pick up a fight, to get attention)
That's what all of my friends say

You, me
We're face to face
But we don't see eye to eye

It's like fire and rain (it's like fire and rain)
You can drive me insane (you can drive me insane)
But I can't stay mad at you for anything

We're Venus and Mars (Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars (like different stars)
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a thing

When I'm yes she's no
When I hold on he just let's go
We're perfectly imperfect
But I wouldn't change a thing, no

It's like fire and rain (it's like fire and rain)
You can drive me insane (you can drive me insane)
But I can't stay mad at you for anything

We're Venus and Mars (Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars (like different stars)
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a thing

But I can't stay mad at you for anything
We're Venus and Mars (Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars (like different stars)
But you're the harmony to every song I sing

And I wouldn't change a
Wouldn't change a thing
