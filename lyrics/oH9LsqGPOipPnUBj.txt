I know I'm not ready to leave
I've all my stuff, but I'm incomplete
Toss and turn in my sleep
Please let me keep my keys

Cause you know you're the
Only one...

I call baby. It's the way it's gonna be
Don't care what you do to me.
Don't care, don't care what you do to me.

And I, don't know why I was so mean to me.
Don't know why I was so angry.
Hurt so bad just to think
What we had will never be.

And I know I'm already beat.
But I don't wanna accept defeat.
I didn't know I was so mean.
(I didn't know I was so mean)

Cause you know you're the only one...

I call baby. It's the way it's gonna be
Don't care what you do to me
Don't care, don't care what you do to me...
