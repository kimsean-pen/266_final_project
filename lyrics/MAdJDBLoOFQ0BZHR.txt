All alone in a wall-less prison
Didn't forget and you're not forgiven
Live every day with the pain in the back of my mind
Torture doesn't begin to describe it

I won't forget. I won't forgive. I won't forget

Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure
There's a bullseye painted on our chests
In the crosshairs of the ignorant
But I am not your scapegoat anymore

All alone with my own decisions
I try to scream but you never will listen
It took a while but you're finally out of my life
And I swear there's no better feeling

I won't forget. I won't forgive. I won't forget.

Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure
There's a bullseye painted on our chests
In the crosshairs of the ignorant
But I am not your scapegoat anymore

Try to scream but you never will listen
Didn't forget and you're not forgiven

Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure
There's a bullseye painted on our chests
In the crosshairs of the ignorant
But I am not your scapegoat anymore
