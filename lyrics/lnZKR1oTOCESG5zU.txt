I don't even know you, get away, get away
It's sunk through, Oh the days, oh days when we
laughed on and stayed up late
I should have sensed what you wanted

Don't you, get away, get away
It's sunk through, Oh the days, oh days when we
Dressed up and followed heart
I should have sensed what you wanted

I would have left and never come back, but life goes on
And life goes on and on and on

I saw the trust you gave melt away
Truth be told, I'd always felt that way

There's nothing left when we grow old
There's nothing left when we grow old

It's like I don't even know you, get away, get away
It's sunk through, Oh the days, oh days when we
laughed on and stayed up late
I should have sensed what you wanted

I don't even know you, It's sunk through
laughed on and stayed up late
I should have sensed what you wanted
Don't you, It's sunk through
Dressed up and followed heart
I should have sensed what you wanted

I should have sensed what you wanted
I miss those days
Back then when we were old souls, You cared enough to smile

It's been so long
