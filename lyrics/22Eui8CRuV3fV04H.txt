Oh, oh, oh, oh
We're starting it over, we're making way for destiny
A time to turn over, a better life for you and me
A new recreation, to channel all this energy, hmmm
It's all the equation, I need to keep you close to me

So baby let your conscience go
There's no turning back when love takes hold

Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me, all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me, all night long

Oh, oh, oh, oh

The more that I see you
The more I know that love belongs
With you in my mind boy
I wouldn't know what's right from wrong

'Cos love will take over
And leave you out of sight and mind (Sight and mind)
You've got to go with the feeling
And trust fate to be kind

And baby let your conscience go
There's no turning back when love takes hold

Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me, all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me, all night long

Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me, all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me (Let's do it)

Oh, oh, oh, oh (Let's do it)

And baby let your conscience go
There's no turning back when love takes hold

Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me, all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me, all night long

Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me, all night long
