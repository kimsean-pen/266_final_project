What is that funny light and sound
Calling me, in my head, repeatedly?
What is that vision there in sight
Before my eyes?
So prominent
So mesmerising, turbulent

You've got a hold on me
Your ingenuity
Seems to be driving me down on my knees
The force you generate
You reinvigorate
Your body tells them 'No mistakes'

For I'm already drawn
Close to the divine
Intoxicating images are rushing through my mind
Embodiment of sin, has seen a way within
Sensation seems to multiply
They're building up inside

Carried through the night
Radiating light
I see you move the crowd
I know what you're about

The stories I have heard
To talk about excess
I know what people say
But surely you impress?

Caressed by a pill
You elevated soul
Vanity and pride
An addict to one
A universal force
A one and only kind
A thing I can't control
No matter how I try

What have you done to me?
This kind of chemistry
Emotions running over me
And when you arch your back
Just when you stay like that
When it's natural to interact

When others holding back
Ready to commence
Caught up in your bliss
You're so confusing and intense
Synergy of two
Energy go wild
See the stars aligned to spell
Our name out in the sky

Jealousy in sight
So fascinating ride
So much faith between
Floating up the steam
Calling out so loud
Beautiful and true
Mystery about
Everything you do

Caressed by a drug
You elevated soul
Vanity and pride
An addict to one
A universal force
A one and only kind
A thing I can't control
No matter how I try

...

This electricity
Injected into me
Emotions running over me
And when you're getting close
You touch my innermost
A feeling deep inside me knows

On a floaty light
Carried through the night
We have got it all
I get through without
Flowing in my veins
Ribbing through my soul
I'll never be the same
The secret can't be told

Charismatic pill
You elevated soul
Vanity and pride
An addict to one
A universal force
A one and only kind
A thing I can't control
No matter how I try
