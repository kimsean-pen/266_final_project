Pieces of me was scattered
blowing in the cold
in different directions
truth, truth, truth be told
Oh, then I looked into your eyes
everything felt like it could be alright
you went and put me back together
back together again
Going through heartache, aw
you know, I think I lost my mind for a time
and couldn't get better
couldn't get no better
no matter, no matter how hard I tried
Then I, I looked into your eyes
and everything felt like it could be alright
You went and put me back together
you went and put me back together
back together again
Somebody sing
Put me back together again
Somebody sing
Hey!
Put me back together again
Oh! Now I'm walking in the sunshine
and everything feels so right
You went and put me right back together
Whoo!
put me right back together
baby, look at what you did
Oh
You did it
back together again
back together again
back together again
And I feel like I'm walking on air, baby
Thank you.
