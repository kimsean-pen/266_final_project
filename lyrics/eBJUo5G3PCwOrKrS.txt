Bestow upon me magic
Wizard - all knowing all wise
I want to rule my kingdom
Make sweet the breeze that was defiled
Dethrone the evil prince's iron fists
In velvet gloves of sin
Parade the grey robed monks
Those vestal virgins, wheel the wyvern's in

Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage
Let me be the protege of five magics

Give me Alchemy
Give me Sorcery
Give me Wizardry
Thermatology
Electricity
Master all of these
Magic if you please
Bring him to his knees

I master five magics
I master five magics
I master five magics
I master five magics

Possessed with hellish torment
(Possessed with hellish torment)
I master magics "5"
(I master magics "5")
Hunting the abyss lord
(Hunting the abyss lord)
Only one will stay alive
(Only one will stay alive)

He who lives by sword
(He who lives by sword)
Will surely also die
(Will surely also die)
He who lives in sin
(He who lives in sin)
Will surely live the lie
