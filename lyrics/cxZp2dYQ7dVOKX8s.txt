Blame the almighty, crucify me, martyrdom, sex, and fame
Screaming "oh my god. oh, that's your god?"
Blindfold the firing squad
Pay the almighty with your body then you can carry me
Screaming "oh no, that's wrong. You don't belong"
Stand before the firing squad

I'm alone again
I'm alone again
I'm alone again
I was fine with those poster ghosts haunting my walls
but now I want it all

"Oh my god. oh, that's your god?"
Blindfold the firing squad
They, the almighty, keep inviting us to all come along
then they scream "oh my god" when they see that you're flawed
take shots at the firing squad

Seems that I'm alone again
but you said you would give me the world
I was fine with those poster ghosts haunting my walls
but now I want it all

Over and over again
Oh my god, is that you god?
I'm over it.

Soul made the devil his riches
because I couldn't have gotten here all by myself

All of us paper thin, pages ripped for money
all of us paper thin, pages ripped for money

Seems that I'm alone again
but you said you would give me the world
I was fine with those poster ghosts haunting my walls
but now I want it all

Seems that I'm alone again
but you said you would give me the world
I was fine with those poster ghosts haunting my walls
but now I want it all
