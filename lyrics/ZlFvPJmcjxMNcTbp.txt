Don't I know it?
Nobody has to say
I've been lucky
guess I was born that way
I thank my father
his absence has made me strong
And I love my mother
but she had troubles with God

No tears
for the life that you've led
You've had angels in your head
Did you hear them singing in the end
All the things that you've seen
All the things that could have been
Well I've been everything I want to be
So, no tears
no tears for me

Yeah, I've bathed in sunshine
but cherished the fading light
And I heard my heartbeat faulter
on a winter's night
I loved a woman
but she didn't hear my prayers
So Lord
oh Lord
I'm yours

No tears
for the life that you've led
You've had angels in your head
Did you hear them singing in the end
All the things that you've seen
All the things that could have been
Well I've been everything I want to be
So, no tears
no tears

Cause someone somewhere's going home tonight
Trying to understand the sacrifice
So save your tears for those left behind

For the life that you've led
You've had angels in your head
Did you hear them singing in the end
All the things that you've seen
All the things that could have been
Well I've been everything I want to be
So, no tears
no tears
no tears for me
