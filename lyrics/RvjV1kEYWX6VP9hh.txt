We're a skin covered in pocks
Celebrate
We have to stop
Film faded into age spots
If we're too rough
It falls apart
Its you and I
Falling

All I want is to be with you
A tan on your porcelain
I will wait for you
Til its over
And its over

If you and I
Mean nothing at all
Take back the time
When i was
Falling
