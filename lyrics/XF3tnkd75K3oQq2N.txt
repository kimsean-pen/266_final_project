Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Why you gotta hug me like that every time you see me?
Why you always making me laugh
Swear you're catching feelings
I loved you from the start

So it breaks my heart
When you say I'm just a friend to you

Cause friends don't do the things we do
Everybody knows you love me too
Tryna be careful with the words I use
I say it cause I'm dying to
I'm so much more than just a friend to you
Mmm, mmm, mmm

When there's other people around
You never wanna kiss me
You tell me it's too late to hang out
And you say you miss me
And I loved you from the start

So it breaks my heart
When you say I'm just a friend to you

Cause friends don't do the things we do
Everybody knows you love me too
Tryna be careful with the words I use
I say it cause I'm dying to
I'm so much more than just a friend to you
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You say I'm just a friend to you
Friends don't do the things we do
Everybody knows you love me too
I tried to be careful with the words I use
I say it cause I'm dying to
I'm so much more than just a friend to you
A friend to you
A friend to you
A friend to you
