I awoke Iapetus
Sing for a while
All the roads reach out to you
Stay for a while
Now I breathe on
Save the work for the afternoon
It's true,
I'll be there for the baby.
I am.

Now I have lost the appetite
Staying for a lie
All the roads that once were right
Stay the way,
they are.

Save the work till the afternoon
It's true...
I'll be there for the baby.
It's true...
It's you.
I'll aways side with you.

'Till I fall.

Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
I awoke Iapetus
Saying you're alive
All the roads lead after you
Saying you're alive
Now I breathe on.
Save the work till the afternoon
It's true...
I'll be there for the baby.

Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
