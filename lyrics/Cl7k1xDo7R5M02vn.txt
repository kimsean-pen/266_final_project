I'm waiting for the night to fall
I know that it will save us all
When everything's dark, keeps us from the stark
Reality

I'm waiting for the night to fall
When everything is bearable
And there in the still, all that you feel
Is tranquility

There is a star in the sky
Guiding my way with its light
And in the glow of the moon
Know my deliverance will come soon

I'm waiting for the night to fall
I know that it will save us all
When everything's dark, keeps us from the stark
Reality

I'm waiting for the night to fall
When everything is bearable
And there in the still, all that you feel
Is tranquility

There is a sound in the calm
Someone is coming to harm
I press my hands to my ears
It's easier here just to forget fear

And when I squinted, the world seemed rose-tinted
Angels appeared to descend
To my surprise, with half-closed eyes
Things looked even better than when they were opened

Been waiting for the night to fall (night to fall)
I knew that it would save us all (save us all)
Now everything's dark, keeps us from the stark
Reality

Been waiting for the night to fall (night to fall)
Now everything is bearable (bearable)
And here in the still, all that you feel
Is tranquility
