This life can make me so confused
But it's alright
Living day by day I feel so used
That ain't right

I just wanna run and hide
But I don't have the time to cry
And it's alright
It's alright, alright

Many thoughts are runnin' through my head
It's alright
Wishing to be somewhere else but here
And it's alright

I can't wait to see your face
I need a smile and your embrace
I'm alright
I'm alright, yeah

Life can bring us through many changes
It's alright
Just don't give up, know that it's gonna be alright

People come and they go
It's just the way that it goes
Everything is everything
It's alright

Sometime the rain, it makes me sad
And it's alright
Some things in the world they make me mad
And it's alright

In the mornin' when I see the sun
I know I'm not the only one
And it's alright
It's alright, yeah

Wish I had some money to pay my bills
I can't even buy that dress on sale
But it's alright

Having money don't mean a thing
Loving you is everything
And I'm alright
I'm alright, yeah

Life can bring us through many changes
It's alright
Just don't give up, know that it's gonna be alright

People come and they go
It's just the way that it goes
Everything is everything
It's alright

Everything is everything
It's gonna be alright
Everything is everything
It's gonna be alright

Life can bring us through many changes
It's alright
Just don't give up, know that it's gonna be alright

People come and they go
That's just the way that it goes
Everything is everything
It's alright

Life can bring us through many changes
It's alright
Just don't give up, know that it's gonna be alright

People come and they go
That's just the way that it goes
Everything is everything
It's alright

Life can bring us through many changes
It's alright
Just don't give up, know that it's gonna be alright

People come and they go
That's just the way that it goes
Everything is everything
It's alright

It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be, gonna be alright
Hold your head up high
Don't you give up, no
