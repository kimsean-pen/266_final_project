To take away our expression
Is to impoverish our existence

Oi!
Yeah, kick it!
Yeah!

It's insatiable; what we're waiting for

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to keep us from fading away
We'll write for a better day

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to keep us from fading away
We'll write

It will flourish
It will thrive
It will nourish
A spring cleaning of the mind

It will flourish
It will thrive
To take away our expression
Is to impoverish our existence

They silence and censor
Our right to create
In cells we choke
Without what is innate

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to stop us from fading away
We'll write for a better day
This vomiting of anguish
An eruption of the soul
To radiate energy
To comfort and console
To scatter our thoughts
To spatter our spirit
A blizzard of fire
With all we transmit

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to stop us from fading away
We'll write for a better day

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to stop us from fading away
We'll write for a better

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to keep us from fading away
We'll write for a better day

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to keep us from fading away
We'll write

It's insatiable; what we're waiting for
It's insatiable; what we're waiting for
It's insatiable; what we're waiting for
It's insatiable; what we're waiting for
It's insatiable; what we're waiting for

It will flourish
It will thrive
It will nourish
A spring cleaning of the mind

It will flourish
It will thrive
Yeah!

It's insatiable; what we're waiting for
It's insatiable; what we're waiting for

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to keep us from fading away
We'll write for a better day

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to stop us from fading away
We'll write for a better day
