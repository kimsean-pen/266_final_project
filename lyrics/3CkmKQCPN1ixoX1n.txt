Try to remember, the echoes and embers
Are heavy on my mind
The pictures are broken, the front door is open
The scars are left behind
Tables turn you once they burning
Leaving me undone
A vision shaking till I break I
Swear to god more words can you just hear me
Just really hear me

I've been drowning in the sea
Of tryna to pleasing you
It's all I ever been, it's all I ever know
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you

Prison is hurting, the drugs aren't working
The wall come crushing down
A never attraction, my insurrection
It's crawling back somehow
Tables turn these words they burn I
Never should have come
A vision shaking till I break I
Swear to god more words can you just hear me
Just really hear me
I've been drowning in the sea
Of tryna to pleasing you

It's all I ever been, it's all I ever know
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you
Turning into you
I'm not how I used to be,
I'm changing cause of you
Screaming just to breathe
It's all I can do
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you
Turning into you

Any more, find a way, hey, hey
Any more, find a way, hey, hey
It's all that I can see, it's all that I can do
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you

I've been drowning in the sea
Of tryna to pleasing you
It's all I ever been, it's all I ever know
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you
Turning into you
I'm not how I used to be,
I'm changing cause of you
Screaming just to breathe
It's all I can do
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you
Turning into you
