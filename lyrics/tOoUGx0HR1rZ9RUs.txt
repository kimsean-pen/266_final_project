I heard
The church bells from afar
But we found each other in the dark
& when

The smoke does finally pass
We will rise above
All the ash
'Cause we're gonna live

We're gonna live
We're gonna live
We're gonna live
We're gonna live

We're gonna live
We're gonna live
We're gonna live
We're gonna live

At last
So bright
The flames burned in our hearts
That we found each other in the dark
Black beast
Out in the wilderness
We are fighting to survive

& convalesce
But we're gonna live
We're gonna live
We're gonna live
We're gonna live
We're gonna live
We're gonna live
We're gonna live
We're gonna live
We're gonna live
Like the rest
Through the black, soulless water
& the cold, lonely air
On the rock, restless seas
The vessel in deep disrepair
& the swans, they started singing
But then oh, rejoice
I can still hear your voice
Then I heard
The church bells from afar
But we found each other in the dark
