Without a lover
Without a friend
Without a savior

Without a friend
Without a lover
Without a friend

Mayflower walked away
Away towards the air
And if you see her
Call out her name

And if you hear her
Out in the rain
Mayflower Maybelle
It was her name

Without a lover
Without a friend
Without a savior

Without a friend
Without a lover
Without a care

Mayflower walked away
Away towards the air
And if you see her
Call out her name

And if you hear her
Out in the rain
Mayflower Maybelle
It was her name
