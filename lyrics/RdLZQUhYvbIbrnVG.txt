sorry for asking you to love me more
sorry if i become a burden i was so fearful of before
never asking you to make me frozen mac n cheese
never asking to sleep in your bed unless your bed's made please
sorry for writing all those love songs for you
is that suffocating to you too?

so throw out all my valentines if that's the only thing to do
you'll fish out the ones you like but i bet my words will be misconstrued

sorry we couldn't work it out
and i couldn't help but want you
sorry you were cozy in a place of not wanting me too
what else am i to do
