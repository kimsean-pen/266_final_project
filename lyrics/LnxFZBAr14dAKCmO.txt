You walk alone
I know the shadows of the world has taken over your empire of light
You've seen the colours of the world burn out in the skyline
This will not be
Let the stars in the night light the path that you walk on
Let it guide you back
Put your faith in yourself, let the sun embrace you
You've been living your life in the dark with the words in your head
That you will never be enough, so instead
You chose to let the wings of faith spread the shadows around
Don't let the darkness get you

You walk alone where sun is still sleeping
And your light is barely flickering
In the wind of fragile hopes that tomorrow comes a new

Wake up
You can't bury down your face in the hands of your regrets
It reflects your past
It won't define who you are, where you're going from here on in
Ignite the world
If your eyes cannot see, I will set your heart free
Let your soul ablaze
If you turn to the light, your ghosts will fade away

You walk alone where the sun is still sleeping and your light is barely flickering
In the wind of fragile hopes that tomorrow comes a new
Let it shine on you, I have seen it in your eyes
That the sparkle of your life is running out

For the love of God, don't let the darkness get you
Fragile lights
Don't let the shadows of disencourage
Flicker your flame with its wings
Let your fire be wild and proud
Don't let the darkness get you

Let me lift you up from the ground
Let me wrap the warmth of my arms
All around your shivering body
Don't let the darkness get you
Let me lift you up from the ground
Let me wrap the warmth of my arms
All around your shivering body
Don't let the darkness get you
