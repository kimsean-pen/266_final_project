I spit raps like a heart attack
fast fatal hard impact
past painful scars infact
I blast tasteful bars in packs

I back up my actions fact
don't ask grab reactions jacked
attack with every word then act
with class as they hear me snap

I got nothing to lose
cuz I fought and felt the bruise
now I'm not the one confused
call the shots and they produce

I ain't lost I'm finally loose
pick a noose over excuse
I need the views to boost me to
a new abuse of being used

everybody wants a piece now
y'all can rest in piece now
your dead to me so peace out
remember your discrete doubt

get ready for defeat now
I'm gon make you bleed out
listen on repeat now
and weed out all the weak now

get up and make a change
don't remember yesterday
if you got something to say
speak your mind before your grave
cuz your life is yours to save
ain't nobody gonna change
everybody stays the same
so be different make a name huh?

and just like a soldier
keep on moving forward
always getting closer
march until it's over

it's ridiculous I'm spitting this
meticulous and limitless
while others out there spittin shit
got hits up on the charts that sit

I see why other artists quit
cuz people don't reward good shit
they love to hate but hate to live
society you swing and miss

and honestly I get it
promise me you won't regret it
wasting energy forget it
don't look back go on get it

bite the bullet just a bit
bite your tounge and don't say shit
make your actions hard to miss
be a legend not a myth

it's obnoxious
that I'm conscious
rappin honest
as promised
try to harness
as an artist
stay modest
it's a long quest
I will not quit
till ten thousand people going off when I drop this

I gotta make it now
swear to god I'm breaking out
swear to god I'll take a bow
center stage with a crowd
cuz I got it figured out
I'm just honest and I'm loud
staying modest but I'm proud
no I never had doubt yea

and just like a soldier
keep on moving forward
always getting closer
march until it's over.
