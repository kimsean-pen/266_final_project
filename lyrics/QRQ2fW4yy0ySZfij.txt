They come around when you are on your knees
Surrounding one by one, taking what you need
Your mouth is dry as you lay down
Begging for those vultures to set you free
Vultures pick your bones, pick them so clean
Bathing in your tears of misery for years
They take you for everything you have
Consuming you 'til there's nothing of you left

Only God knows what's wrong with me

They show up when you stink and rot
Taking everything that's precious to your heart
When you have been stripped down
Vultures fly away, thorns in your crown

Only God knows what's wrong
Only God knows what's wrong with me
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Vultures circle all around you
They come to take your soul across the river

They only come around when things are wrong
They only come around when you got what they want

Only God knows what's wrong
Only God knows what's wrong with me
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Vultures circle all around you
They come to take your soul across the river
Vultures circle all around you
They come to take your soul across the river
Vultures circle all around you
They come to take your soul across the river
