Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she make me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
From blue jeans and leather
Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather

C'mon now
Hooo

We'll be walkinG down the boardwalk
WatchinG them jaws drop
But ain't nobody looking at me
They're all too busy staring
At what she ain't wearing
Can you blame her? It's a hundred degrees

Yeah, all them girls are jealous
'Cause they know why the fellas
Are watching her put on a show
Hey, every time they see her
They all just wanna be her
Making country boys hearts explode

Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she make me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots, blue jeans and leather
Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather

Oh, my my
C'mon now

She get it from her mama
Back in Tullahoma
Small town Tennessee
She wasn't made for drama
But like Nascar and Daytona
Yeah, that girl was made for me

Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she make me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots and blue jeans and leather
Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather

Woooo

Play that thang

Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she make me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots, blue jeans and leather
Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather

Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she make me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots and blue jeans and leather
Yeah, my girl was made for short skirt weather
Yellow polka dots, blue jeans and leather
Oh, my baby's made for short skirt weather

Come on now
