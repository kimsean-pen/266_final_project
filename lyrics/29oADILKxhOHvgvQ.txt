Is that a hearse or a limousine?
It's like I've seen it on the TV screen.
She had the body of a beauty queen,
put on a pedestal for good hygiene.

I saw a girl that looked like you
and I wanted to tell everyone to run away from her.
Run away, run away!
It couldn't have been you but she had your eyes,
made for faking smiles and turning tides,
hands full of young men wrapped around her finger.

They made you a throne out of magazines.
They made you a crown out of peonies.
She grew up as the pretty young thing,
let them look up her skirt on the backyard swing.
Oh no...

Daddy told you to stay indoors
and I can understand how a girl gets bored-
too old to play and too young to mess around.
She was a victim of the same disease
that's roaming the streets and bites when it please
and makes us wanna live forever or die in infamy.

I wanna live in a world where I can keep my doors wide open,
but who knows what'd get in and what'd get out.
One of these nights, I'll sleep with the windows down,
but not until that creature's in the pound.

No child is born knowing there's an ugly or evil thing.
When did my folks stop covering my eyes?
Was it my brother who taught me about jealousy?
Was it my sister who taught me about vanity?
Was it that girl, that beautiful girl,
thirsty for love and eager for attention,
was it that girl who taught me about destruction?

I wanna live in a world where I can keep my doors wide open,
but who knows what'd get in and what'd get out?
