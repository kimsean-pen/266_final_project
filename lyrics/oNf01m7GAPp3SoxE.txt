If you close the door, the night could last forever
Leave the sun shine out and say, "Hello to never"
All the people are dancing and they're havin' such fun
I wish it could happen to me
But if you close the door, I'd never have to see the day again
If you close the door, the night could last forever
Leave the wineglass out and drink a toast to never

Oh, someday I know someone will look into my eyes
And say, "Hello, you're my very special one"
But if you close the door, I'd never have to see the day again
Dark cloudy bars, shiny Cadillac cars
And the people on subways and trains
Looking grey in the rain as they stand disarrayed
Oh the people will dwell in the dark

And if you close the door, the night could last forever
Leave the sun shine out and say, "Hello to never"
All the people are dancing and they're having such fun
I wish it could happen to me
'Cause if you close the door, I'd never have to see the day again
I'd never have to see the day again
Once more
I'd never have to see the day again
