I am, I am, I
I will return always
I am, I am, I I will return always

I am reminded now of all the years gone by
No use in crying now, it's time to say goodbye

Turn the page on all we are
Always searching
Turn the page on all we were
Always searching...
Always searching...

All now be as one!

Hey, my dear the way you must feel,
the weight of this life is twisting your mind
Cage my fear Elektra is here,
the truth of your mind and the words of the vine
'Cause I wish you would get it right too,
so we pray to the gods 'cause it's time you arrived

I am, I am, I
I will return always
I am, I am, I I will return always

'Follow emotions? Dumb.'

Slowly we grow the second wave, but the northern people like it cold.

So, raise your glasses to the underworld! (See ya!)

What are we doing tonight?

Watching universes collide!

Hey, my dear the way you must feel,
the weight of this life is twisting your mind
I hope you will show me right through the
prayer from the goddess of infinite light
And I won't wait or fear the mistakes we
learned in our youth now it's time to arrive

I must learn from this reality if I intend to awake
Though I travel to the infinite, I will return always!

I am, I am, I
I will return always
I am, I am, I will return always
