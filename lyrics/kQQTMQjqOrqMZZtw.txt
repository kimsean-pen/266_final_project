Are you really here
Or am I dreaming
I can't tell dreams from truth
For it's been so long
Since I have seen you
I can hardly remember your face anymore
When I get really lonely
And the distance calls its only silence
I think of you smiling
With pride in your eyes
A lover that sighs
If you want me
Satisfy me
If you want me
Satisfy me

Are you really sure
That you believe me
When others say I lie
I wonder if you could
Ever despise me
When you know I really try
To be a better one to satisfy you
For you're everything to me
And I do what you ask me
If you let me be free

If you want me
Satisfy me
If you want me
Satisfy me
If you want me
Satisfy me
If you want me
Satisfy me
If you want me, satisfy me
