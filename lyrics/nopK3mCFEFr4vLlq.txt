It"s a long way to reality from the mind"s extremities
Deep in the core of the subconscious realm lies
A shrouded being, cowering
Suspended entity in darkness
Encapsulated in a crystalline state
A soft glowing green in black
Amebic dark, invading
Scampering through a silent chasm
On the other side beams a ray of light
The beacon becomes obscured
As the walls structuralize
Cubiform crystallization
A daunted hero falls to its knees
A piece of eternity from within
Condemned to memory
One side is lost
While the other is gained
Will the two ever be one in the same?
Suspended entity in darkness
Encapsulated in a crystalline state
A soft glowing green in black
Amebic dark, invading
Retaliating echos puncturing my sanity
The essence of my being is only a memory
Crippling vices instilled confirm the soul to seclusion
Disonant existence
Feelings and thoughts without resolution
Life is liquid when we"re young
We paint with the colors of the sun
Time solidifies in our brains
And we paint with shades of grey
All I see are dark clouds over a sunny day
The colorful picture of life solidifies and strips away
Tetrastructural minds
What once was liquid is frozen in time
A cold cubic cell traps all hope deep inside
Amebic dark, invading
