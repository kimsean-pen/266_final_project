i remember you on the bed at 2 am
the lights were blu
that's when i knew
i needed to run away, get out of this place.

and now, now i know
all i want is you
but i'm all alone
and there's nothing i would rather do than unplug the phones
i don't feel like myself at all
i'm just a soul without a shell, now i'm gone
