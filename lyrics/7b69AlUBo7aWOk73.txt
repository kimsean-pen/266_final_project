Daniel read the paragraph he read until the words ran out
It's saying we're all in trouble now
Poison in the juice carafe we drank until our thirst ran out
Oh no! We're in some trouble now

Everyone wants to be a perpetual motion machine
We all try harder as the days run out
We all try harder as the days run out
We all try harder as the days run out

With your teeth to your lips and your head to the ground
Well, you hear the fish and they're making this sound
Saying, "We just want to go on walking around
And feel what it's like to fall down"

Patrick ran the race yeah, he ran until the time ran out
Oh no, I'm in some trouble now
Tried to kick it over, I tried until the juice ran out
Oh no, we want more trouble now

With your teeth to your lips and your head to the ground
Well, you hear the fish and they're making this sound
Saying, "We just want to go on walking around
And feel what it's like to fall down"
I SAW...

[Mumbling]

Everyone wants to be a perpetual motion machine
We all try harder as the days run out
We all try harder as the days run out
We all try harder as the days run out
