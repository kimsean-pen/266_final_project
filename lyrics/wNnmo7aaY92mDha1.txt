Time passes by, direction unknown
You've left us now, but we're not alone
Before you know it your cups overflown
You measured no one that I've ever known

And it's quite alright
And goodbye for now
Just look up to the stars
And believe who you are
'Cause it's quite alright
And so long, goodbye

We always knew that it'd come to this
It's times like these I forget what I miss
Matters of heart are hard to address
Especially when yours is full of emptiness

And it's quite alright
And goodbye for now
Just look up to the stars
And believe who you are
'Cause it's quite alright
And so long, goodbye

Well, Time passes by, direction unknown
You've left us now, but we're not alone
Before you know it your cups overflown
Well, You measured no one that I've ever known

And it's quite alright
And goodbye for now
Just look up to the stars
And believe who you are
'Cause it's quite alright
And so long, goodbye
