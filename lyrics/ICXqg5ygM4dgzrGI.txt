Into the void
Into the void
Into the void

Everyday starts with a war
Everyday starts with harmful words
You and me like fire and ice

In the shadows of my world
I hide from all this violence
but you...

you are the queen of temptation

Hey hey hey hey
When will you erase me?
When will you lead me into the void?
Hey hey hey hey
When will you kill me?
I wanna die for you tonight

I wanna break the spell
I wanna save my life
But then you look at me
And I'm lost in your eyes

In the shadows of my world
I hide from all this violence
but you...

you are the queen of temptation

you are the queen of temptation
Hey hey hey hey
When will you erase me?
When will you lead me into the void?
Hey hey hey hey
When will you kill me?
I wanna die for you tonight

Why dont you set me free?
Why dont you set me free?
You set me free
Why dont you set me free?
Why dont you set me free?
Why dont you set me free?
You set me free
Hey hey hey hey
When will you erase me?
When will you lead me into the void?
Hey hey hey hey
When will you kill me?
I wanna die for you tonight

Hey hey hey hey
When will you erase me?
When will you lead me into the void?
Hey hey hey hey
When will you kill me?
I wanna die for you tonight

Into the void
