A trail of tears beyond redemption
Just a word and nothing more, no more
I must reveal I am falling
To the dark
I now am born

So if you hear this cry

Show me a sign, give me meaning
Lead me to life, let me know
Why all the lies I'm believing
Have led me so far, far from home

Cutting anguish not forgotten
Eternal life will not be mine tonight
But if I wake to find perdition
This I know, the fault is mine
This I know, the fault is mine

So if you hear this cry

Show me a sign, give me meaning
Lead me to life, let me know
Why all the lies I'm believing
Have led me so far, far from home

And the fire inside is gone
And all that I once had is lost
To the darkness I am born

A trail of tears beyond redemption
Just a word and nothing more
I must reveal that I'm falling
To the dark I am born

Show me a sign, give me meaning
Lead me to life, let me know
Why all the lies I'm believing
Have led me so far, far from home
