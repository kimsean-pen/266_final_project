Songs we started
Left me broken hearted
I have been frozen in time, yeah
Roses on your mind
Will call you home
Prayers unspoken
Left no hearts unbroken
I've been turning on a dime, yeah
Roses on your mind
Will call you home

Said we're not in love
We just hang out high as kites
Said we're not in love
We're just halfway out of our mind
And we hang out high as kites
We're not in love we're just high
We're just high

Second verses
Are the worst of curses
How can we define the line yeah
Roses on your mind
Will call you home

Said we're not in love
We just hang out high as kites
Said we're not in love
We're just halfway out of our mind
And we hang out high as kites
Said we're not in love we're just high
We're just high
We're just high
We're just high

We're not in love
We're not in love
We're not in love
We're not in love
We just hang out high as kites
We're not in love
We're just halfway out of our mind
And we hang out high as kites
We're not in love we're just high
We're just high
