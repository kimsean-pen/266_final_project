I can still smell the smoke
In the halls of your home
Hidden in your dads cologne
I haven't talked to you in years
But I guess the truth is tough
You grow up and you lose touch

Well it's been a while
It's been a while
Since I saw your face

Or I said your name

I've been feeling low, put it all on paper
All black on, call me Zack Taylor
I'm lacking cash, writing raps
Trying to make it work
Faking smiles, been while since I haven't hurt
What do I do when I can't even feel
Anything now when I try? No deal
Rolling round in that subaru
Like I'm Ken Block when I'm coming through
Nah, how the fuck could I flex now
Got 8 bucks in my bank account
And it's been a while since you've been around
And it's been a minute see we used to kick it
I'm gone
Things change
I'm a fool for thinking they would be the same
Knowing that I'm growing and I'm losing friends
But it's okay

Man, it's alright
I'm just happy that I made through another fucking night

I can still smell the smoke
In the halls of your home
Hidden in your Dad's cologne
I haven't talked to you in years
But I guess the truth is tough
You grow up and you lose touch
