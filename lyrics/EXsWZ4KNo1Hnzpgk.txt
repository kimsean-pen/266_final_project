No I won't do it again
I don't want to pretend
If it can't be like before
I've got to let it end
I don't want what I was
I had a change of head
But maybe, someday
Yeah maybe, someday

I've got to let it go
And leave it gone
Just walk away
Stop it going on
Get, too scared to jump
If I wait too long
But maybe, someday

Yeah
I'll see you smile as you call my name
Start to feel and it feels the same
And I know that maybe someday's come
Maybe someday's come again

So tell me someday's come
Tell me someday, come again

No I won't do it some more
Doesn't take any sense
If we can't be like it was
I've got to let it rest
I don't want what I did
I had a change of tense
But maybe someday

Yeah
I'll see you smile as you call my name
Start to feel and it feels the same
And I know that maybe someday's come
Maybe someday's come

If I could do it again
Maybe just once more
Think I could make it work
Like I did it before
If I could try it out
If I could just be sure
That maybe someday is the last time
Yeah maybe someday, is the end
Or maybe someday, is when it all stops
Or maybe someday always comes again
