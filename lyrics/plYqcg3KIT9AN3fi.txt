I am a vision, I am justice
Never thought that I could love
Living in shadows, faded existence
It was never good enough
Within the darkness
You are the light
That shines away
You're trapped in violence

I can be the man
Who saves the day
I'm there for you
No matter what
I'm there for you

Never giving up

I'm there for you
For you
Someone has changed me
Something saved me
Now this is who I am
Although I was blinded

My heart let me find that
Truth makes a better man
I didn't notice
That you were right
In front of me
A mask of silence

We'll put away

So we can see
I'm there for you
No matter what
I'm there for you

Never giving up
I'm there for you
For you
For you

Within the darkness
You are the light
That shines away
In this blind justice
I can be the man
Who saves the day
I'm there for you
No matter what
I'm there for you
Never giving up
You know it's true
You were there for me
And I'm there for you
For you
For you
For you
