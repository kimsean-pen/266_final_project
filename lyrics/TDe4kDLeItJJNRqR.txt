When I was just a little girl
I asked my mother "What will I be?
Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?"
Here's what she said to me:

Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, que sera, que sera

When I grew up and fell in love
I asked my lover "What will I be?
Will I have rainbows day after day?"
Here's what my lover said:

Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, que sera, que sera

I was holding on to the illusions of my mind
I will worry about nothing
But now I know, I have to let go and embrace the moment
Open up your mind
and set yourself free
All you got to do is let it be
Que sera, que sera, que sera

Now I have children of my own
They ask their mother "What will I be?
Will I be handsome? Will I be rich?"
I tell them tenderly:

Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, que sera, que sera

I was holding on to the illusions of my mind
I will worry about nothing
But now I know, I have to let go and embrace the moment
Open up your mind
and set yourself free
All you got to do is let it be
Que sera, que sera, que sera
