Standing in the airport
I am waiting for a plane
Goin' east to London
Want to be back there again
It's the right time of year
All the trees are autumn brown
But I really only want to get to you

Sitting by the window
Watching ocean going by
Seems I should be with you
But how fast can this thing fly
Hey, how it seem like an eternity
All the time it took me trying to get to you

Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better

Standing in the airport
I am getting off the plane
Glad to be in London
Even though it's pouring rain
It's a bright sunny day
When I see you run my way
But it took me twenty years to get to you

It's a bright sunny day
When I see you run my way
But it took me twenty years to get to you

Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better

Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better

Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
