Hey, look over your shoulder Hey, it's me gettin' older Always thought I
should've told you It's alright, but it's sure gettin' colder I know you're
over my shoulder I know now you'll get to hold her You're gone But it can't be
wrong You're gone Can't be for long You walked over my shoulder You came cause
I told you You thought I knew it was over All you knew was to hold her You're
gone It can't be wrong You're gone Don't stay for long [Solo] You figure this,
you don't get to be I'm wrong, whatever it's still the same I know it's over
your shoulder I know now you'll get to hold her When I wake up And you are gone
When I wake up I knew all along When I wake up And you are gone When I wake up
I knew all along [Solo] You're gone But it can't be wrong You're gone Don't
stay too long You're gone But it can't be wrong You're gone Can't be for long
