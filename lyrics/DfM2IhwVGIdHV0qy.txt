Threw a rock
Up to your window
Poor use of night
Hanging feet
From the rafters
Late on rent! Is it me you're after?
Shot back
Hit my face
Finally heard some laughter

Sun chatter
At a mumble
Covered by the cause
Sweet demon
An empty stomach
Tab clears at the bar
Hopped up on
Telluride speed
Think I owe you from last time

Bulk jotter
Loose binding
Tried to read you in the wrong way
Venus burning
Not trying
Glossed over at the wrong pace
Dressed down
For revival
I lost it all in the right way
