I see it when you smile
You're feeling kinda flat
Not sure what you're doing
But we've all felt that

Are you looking for someone
Just to hold you close?
You could do better
You could do better then him, you know

It's easy to see
From the backseat of your life
I've told you once
I'll tell you again tonight

That boy
Ain't good to you
He's breaking your heart
And it's breaking mine too

You're feeling things
That you don't understand
I guess your heart didn't listen to the plan

I gotta let you know
What your friends don't say to you
I know the way he makes you feel
Girl, that boy, he's no good for you

It's easy to see
From the backseat of your life
I've told you once
I'll tell you again tonight

That boy
Ain't good to you
He's breaking your heart
And it's breaking mine too

That boy
Ain't good to you
He's breaking your heart
And it's breaking mine too

You keep going back
Time and time again
Maybe you're just addicted to pain

But I've been thinking
Thinking quite a lot
Maybe you and I
Maybe we should give it a shot

That boy
Ain't good to you
He's breaking your heart
And it's breaking mine too

That boy
Ain't good to you
He's breaking your heart
And it's breaking mine too

It's easy to see
From the backseat of your life
I've told you once
I'll tell you again tonight

That boy
Ain't good to you
He's breaking your heart
And it's breaking mine too

That boy
Ain't good to you
He's breaking your heart
And it's breaking mine too
