I met her at the Burger King
We fell in love by the soda machine
So we took the car downtown
The kids were hanging out all around

Then we went down to Coney Island
On the coaster and around again
And no one's gonna ever tear us apart
Cause she's my sweetheart
All right, oh yeah

Oh, Oh, I Love Her So

Oh, Oh, I Love Her So

Oh, Oh, I Love Her So

Oh, Oh, I Love Her So

Oh, Oh, I Love Her So

Oh, Oh, I Love Her So

Hanging out on a night like this
I'm gonna give her a great big kiss
I'm gonna make her mine
And everything's gonna be real fine
