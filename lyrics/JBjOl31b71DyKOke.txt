In our pain and sinning fall
Accept peace and whine
Going bad and taking all this
It's of each and tide
Calling bean and sinning call
Now I'm neat and tight
Gonna crap with naked Elvis
Sits there cheating high

Tonight, Jesus loves you
Tonight, Jesus loves you
Tonight, Jesus loves you
Tonight, Jesus loves you

We are dead and cynical
Gun of peace in my eye
See the back with naked Elvis
It's a cheating high

But she will back on mainframe
She got crack on cocain
She got crack on seeing
Cheater, cheater...

Tonight, Jesus loves you
Tonight, Jesus loves you
Tonight, Jesus loves you
Tonight, Jesus loves you
Tonight, Jesus loves you
Tonight, Jesus loves you
Tonight, Jesus loves you

Till our death and sinning call
Except she can hide
All those fat and sacred elders
Sister off and bad-eyed

She got back on mainframe
She got crack on cocain
She got crack on seeing
Cheater, cheater...

Tonight, Jesus loves you
Tonight, Jesus loves you
Tonight, Jesus loves you
Tonight, Jesus loves you
Tonight, Jesus loves you
Tonight, Jesus loves you
Tonight, Jesus loves you

Rise tonight
