If I make it
If I make it
If I make it
If I make it

Riding home
On this dark energy
First you take the light
And hold it
Remember who you are
And where you're gonna be
What's inside you
Is sacred

If I make it
If I make it
If I make it
If I make it

Riding home
On this dark energy
First you take the light
And hold it
Remember who you are
And where you're gonna be
What's inside you
Is sacred
