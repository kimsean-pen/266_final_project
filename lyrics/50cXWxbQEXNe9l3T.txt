Can't you see the silhouettes
Of a thousand people walking past
You reach your arm for help, but no one sees
I can't feel the breeze upon my face
I'm trapped in outer space
Without a place to rest and slowly breath
It's hard without a friend
My bones are wearing down
Don't have much left in me
Please don't count me out, before I bleed
I'm watching as the building burns
The voices scream, shoulders turn away
To hide the frightening site to see
Going through catastrophe, while all these humans laugh at me
It seems as they were born a different breed
We must lend a hand to those who feel they're at the end
An act of love can really go the distance

It's hard without a friend
My bones are wearing down
Don't have much left in me
Please don't count me out, before I bleed
Plea, p-p, please don't count me out
Out, out
Out, out

Can't you see the silhouettes
Of a thousand people walking past
You reach your arm for help, but no one sees
I can't feel the breeze upon my face
I'm trapped in outer space
Without a place to rest and slowly breath
It's hard without a friend
My bones are wearing down
Don't have much left in me
Please don't count me out, before I bleed
I'm watching as the building burns
The voices scream, shoulders turn away
To hide the frightening site to see
Going through catastrophe, while all these humans laugh at me
It seems as they were born a different breed
We must lend a hand to those who feel they're at the end
An act of love can really go the distance
