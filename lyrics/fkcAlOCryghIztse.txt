I'm like quiet from small town
He's like honest with a big mouth
Watch him try to figure me out
I can't even think straight

And I don't know how to analyze
What's going on in my mind
He's got me blurring all the lines
And I can't really concentrate

He's what's keeping me up
When I turn off my night light
But I know that he's going home to her tonight

You strike a match and I feel the rush
But baby this is dangerous
You fan the flames watch me suffocate
While you're doing just fine
And the alarms are going off
And the sprinklers are turning on
But if you asked me to stay
Baby I'd be up in smoke before I'd put out these

And I know I gotta get out
Cause I'm in way too deep now
You just say my name
And everything's okay again

You tell me bout your family
I tell you bout my exes
I can't stop staring at you putting on your headband
With you I'm never bored cause everything
you say is something I have never heard before

You're perfect I think you deserve the whole world
I hope you know that and I hope so does your girl

You strike a match and I feel the rush
But baby this is dangerous
You fan the flames watch me suffocate
While you're doing just fine
And the alarms are going off
And the sprinklers are turning on
But if you asked me to stay
Baby I'd be up in smoke before I'd put out these

And I'll cry in my car and pretend it's a movie
I've never experienced this thing you're doing to me
From the start I didn't stand a chance
It's just the way that you are it's the way that I am

There's nothing I can do now
But slowly turn to ashes on the ground

You strike a match and I feel the rush
But baby this is dangerous
You fan the flames watch me suffocate
While you're doing just fine
And the alarms are going off
And the sprinklers are turning on
But if you asked me to stay
Baby I'd be up in smoke before I'd put out these
