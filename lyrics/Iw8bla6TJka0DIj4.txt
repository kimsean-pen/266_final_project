As we're set to die
On our way to Rome
Under darkening skies
Loaded clouds of smoke
Oh the brilliant lies
We'll be fighting for
As we're set to die
On our way to Rome

Ride
The dark horse
Through the fire
Through the storm

As we're set to die
In the heart of the sun
In the burning skies
We had the greatest fun
It's the brightest light
And the loudest gun
As we're set to die
In the heart of the sun

Ride
The dark horse
Through the fire
Through the storm

As we're set to die
On our way to Rome
Under darkening skies
Loaded clouds of smoke
Oh the brilliant lies
We'll be fighting for
As we're set to die
On our way to Rome

Ride
The dark horse
Through the fire
Through the storm
