You got a lot to learn
I got a lot to lose
Guess I hold a candle
For singers of the blues

You're a hard case to refuse

Call down any witness
Lord, I stand accused
But I'll be back in business
If they cut me loose

You're a hard case to refuse

You're a hard
You're a hard case to choose
Living a lie and loving you
You're a hard case to refuse
Oh such a hard case to refuse

You got a lot to learn
I got a lot to lose
Guess I hold a candle
For singers of the blues

You're a hard case to refuse

Lord, I got it in me
What it comes down to
Climb that concertina
And come back when you're bruised

You're a hard case to refuse

You're a hard
You're a hard case to choose
Living a lie and loving you
You're a hard case to refuse - oh yea
Hard case to refuse
Hard case to refuse - I'm a witness)
Hard living the blues
Hard case to refuse - I ain't giving up on you
Hard case to refuse
