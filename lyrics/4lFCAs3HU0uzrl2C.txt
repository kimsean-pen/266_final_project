How've they dared to be
Such misguided creatures
How've they dared to be
Of such evil nature
Spiral up to doors all sealed
No turning back
Red door to Discordia

Steal the stars
Deceive the day
A sign of evil
They're gone with a final warning

Witness the twilight of the gods
Will they ever return
A storm will take us
And then wipe us out
There's no retreat

We're trapped in twilight
While the gods will drowse
Gods will drowse
They'll wait and sleep
Until a new dawn'll save us from the dark

The damage's done
The king is gone

There is war
Wherever I'll roam
Gods will come and
Gods will go
The spinning wheel keeps turning

Now get up
Lay down your ancient faith
We're the chosen ones
Come feel the change

A way
Let me show a new way
When you dare to walk with me
Bow down
And surrender
The old gods

Black or white
To me it's grey
A sign of evil
I hail all these non-believers

Witness the twilight of the gods
Will they ever return
A storm will take us
And then wipe us out
There's no retreat

We're trapped in twilight
While the gods will drowse
Gods will drowse
They'll wait and sleep
Until a new dawn'll save us from the dark

Deliver your gods
They shall be slain
I'm their fallen son
Don't be afraid

A way
Let me show a new way
When you're going to walk with me
As one
We're infernal

What's going up
It will come down
We're here to change
There's war in Discordia

Sure as death
We all must fade
A sign of evil
Now reach for a new horizon

Witness the twilight of the gods
Will they ever return
A storm will take us
And then wipe us out
There's no retreat

We're trapped in twilight
While the gods will drowse
Gods will drowse
They'll wait and sleep
Until a new dawn'll save us from the dark
