Phantom legs and blinking pigs haunting me
My long lost love and the memories of you
These nights are haunting me
I don't wanna run, I don't wanna leave
Now that you're standing closer
I don't wanna run, I don't wanna leave
Was distance moan and a smell of home haunting me
From the clouds above and the memory of you
Though these nights are haunting me
I don't wanna run, I don't wanna leave
Now that you're standing closer
I don't wanna run, I don't wanna leave
Though these nights are haunting me
I don't wanna run, I don't wanna leave
Now that you're standing closer
I don't wanna run, I don't wanna leave
