Face it,
I turn to you and I can face it
Us head first into the depths unseen
Lets me know that it's alright

Face it
I turn to you and I can face it
Us as one headed to the darkness now
Let's me know that I'm fine

I'd give up the country life
I'd fall for you anytime
I'd give up the country life
I'd give up city life
I'd fall for you anytime
Anytime

Face it
You turn to me and you can face it
Us head first into the depths unseen
Let's you know that its alright

Face it
You turn to me and you can face it
Us as one head into the darkness now
Lets me know that I'm fine

I'd give up the country life
I'd fall for you anytime
I'd give up the country life
I'd give up city life
I'd fall for you anytime
Anytime
