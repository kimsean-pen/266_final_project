I went down to the St. James Infirmary
saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long, white table.
So cool, so sweet, so sweet, so fare

Let it go, let it go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
she can search this whole wide world over
she won't never going to find another man like me

When I die, I bury me a straight lace shoes
a box back coat and a stetson hat
put 20 dollar gold piece on my watch chain
So the boys goin'to know that I died standing pat
