I'm getting lost in your curls
I'm drawing pictures on your skin, so soft it twirls
I like your looks when you get mean
I know I shouldn't say so but when you
Claw me like a cat, I'm beaming
I like the way you squeeze my hand
Pulling me into another dream
A lucid dream

I'm getting lost in your curls
I'm getting crushed out on the things
That only I should see
Not for boys, they're just for me
Hurry to talk, from far away

I can see you, you curl your fists and you pull your hair
When we're alone, I wanna say
Let's just stay in, no one's here in our apartment babe

Put on the dress that I like
It makes me so crazy, though I can't say why
Keep on your stockings for a while
Some kind of magic in the way you're lying there

I'm getting lost in your curls
I'm getting rushed back on a whim
Our breaths get wind
Back to the time when we were green
I know we have changed
But I still grin 'cause I can't wait to see you
Back to the time I touched your hair
When I was so scared to look that mean, I think it's weird

I'm getting lost in your curls
I'm getting crushed out on the things
that only I should see
They're not for boys, they're just for me
We're in the dark, from far away

It's so hard for me
Only to get the urge to kiss you there
When we're alone, I wanna say
Let's just stay in, no one's here in our apartment babe

Put on the dress that I like
It makes me so crazy, though I can't say why
Keep on your stockings for a while
Some kind of magic in the way you're lying there

Put on your dress that I like
It makes me so crazy, though I can't say why
Keep on your stockings for a while
Some kind of magic in the way you talk about your

Blue eyeshadow
It's not exactly blue no
If you're to call it
Anything but your blue.
