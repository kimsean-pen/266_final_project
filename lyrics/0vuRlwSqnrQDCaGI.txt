Sow into you
Into you
Into you

What the...
What the...
Did you do to me
Heavy cloud come down on
When all of heaven's bliss
Is in this perfect kiss

Rain down on me

Bring me a change in the weather
Break open the sky
Heat keeps building
It's hot in the city
And I'm not sleeping at night
Can I get relief

I am a lyrical soul
Bound to get carried away
But there's nothing left to say
'cept I I I I I
I am a lyrical soul
I I I I I love you

Sow into
Into you
I'll bring you
Into this earth
Has sorely missed the kiss of rain

Sow into
Into you
I'll bring you up into it
Is this how it feels to kiss the same

I chose you for your wave
Frequency
You take me up against the freak in me
Just tell me what you
X X X expect of me
Expect of me

I am a lyrical soul
Bound to get carried away
But I think it's fair to say
You Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Love me

Sow into
Into you
I'll bring you
Into this earth
Has sorely missed the kiss of rain

Sow into
Into you
i'll bring you up into it
Is this how it feels to kiss the same

Sow into
Into you
I'll bring you
Into this earth
Has sorely missed the kiss of rain

Sow into
Into you
i'll bring you up into it
Is this how it feels to kiss the same

Sow into
Into you
I'll bring you
Into this earth
Has sorely missed the kiss of rain

And I think it's here to stay
Sow into
Though I'm bound to get carried away
I'll bring you
But I think it's here to stay
Though I'm bound to get carried away
