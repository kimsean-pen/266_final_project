If you think it's over
Better think again
There'll be no compromise
Turning up the power
Feel adrenaline
Move into overdrive

Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution

If you think I'd back down
Or accept defeat
Brace for the aftershock
Driven to the limit
Take it to the streets
Give it everything you've got

Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution

Time to come together
Revolution
Living on forever
Revolution
Get ready for the evolution

Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution, yeah

Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution, ah

Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution

Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
