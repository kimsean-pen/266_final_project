Down in New Orleans where everything's fine
All them cats is drinkin' that wine
Drinkin' that mess is their delight when they get drunk
Start singin' all night

Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee drinkin' wine
Wine spo-dee-o-dee drinkin' wine
Wine spo-dee-o-dee drinkin' wine
Pass that bottle to me

Now I've got a nickel, have you got a dime?
Let's get together and get a little wine
Some buys a gallon some buys a quart
When you buy black beer, now you're doin' things smart

Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee
Down on Rempart Street in Willie's den
He would sell but a gill of gin
One cat wanted a bottle of wine
He hooked that cat for a dollar and a dime
Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee
