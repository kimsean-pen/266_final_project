Walking through this corridor, I need to
Somehow get back to my room
But I don't know where that may be
Oh look there is an elevator
All looks the same to me
Carpets don't seem to change!
Walk in a room, yea it's dark and cold now
Something is not right
Quick now, all the doors look just the same to me
Oh look there is an elevator
Press the button now it's open
Take me to the top floor

I close my eyes
Try to sleep through the night
The peace I crave soon drifts away
Why do you choose to follow me this way?
Why can't you just leave me alone?

Walking through the corridor again
I start to shiver now
I see a figure in the house
Now she is approaching me
What can I do for thee?
Can you find the bathroom?
Impossible mission
Where are we?
I thought you knew?
Who the fuck are you?
Oh no!
Just keep on walking now
Left, right, left, right
Oh look there is an elevator
Press the button now it's open
Take me away from here

I close my eyes
Try to sleep through the night
The peace I crave soon drifts away
Why do you chose to follow me this way?
Why can't you just leave me alone?

Night terror (let me be)
Night terror let me be
Night terror
Leave me alone

No I can't make it
Think I need to wake up
A hall of mirrors, monsters on the ceiling
Why am I frozen?
Emotional dysfunction?
Run towards the brightest light
Do you know or are you guessing?
Where you may go, they follow thee
I run towards the light
But now I'm starting to fall
High in the sky, I need to learn to fly now
I try to flap and flap my wings
Wake up again screaming

Wake in light of day
But nothing seems the same
In a world that grew estranged
Nothing seems the same
