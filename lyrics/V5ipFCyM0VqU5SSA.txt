Tell it face to face
You got you a race
Ain't got no time to taste
Low stars in fire (?)
If I went away
You could walk today
Time walks a world away
Screw me, you try

You're gonna kill some
You're gonna free some
You're gonna lose someone
You're gonna taste (fake?) some
You're gonna want some
You're gonna believe (need?) someone

What you're feedin me
Don't make a mark of me
I don't bruise so easily
No scars inside (?)

I tell it face to face
Got no time to taste
My memory's your fate
No scars inside (?)

You're gonna kill some
You're gonna free some
You're gonna lose someone
You're gonna taste some
You're gonna want some
You're gonna believe someone

Send me alone
I'm solemn and sorry

I'm gonna need some
I'm gonna need some
You're gonna need someone
Did you believe some
You're gonna breathe some
You're gonna free someone

Send me alone (?)
Aahhh...

Tell it face to face
You got you a race
Face to face
You got you a race
Tell it face to face
