Without a sound I took her down
And dressed in red and blue I squeezed
Imaginary wedding gown
That you can't wear in front of me

A kiss goodbye
Your twisted shell
As rice grains and roses fall at your feet
We'll say goodbye
The hundredth time
And then tomorrow we'll do it again
Tomorrow we'll do it again

I dragged her down
I put her out
And back there I left her where no one could see
And lifeless, cold
Into this well
I stared as this moment was held for me

A kiss goodbye
Your twisted shell
As rice grains and roses fall at your feet
Say goodbye
The hundredth time
And then tomorrow we'll do it again

I never thought it'd be this way
Just me and you we're here alone
And if you say
All I'm asking for is
A thousand bodies piled up
I never thought would be enough
To show you just what I've been thinking

And I'll keep on making more
Just to prove that I adore
Every inch of sanity
All I'm asking for is...
All I'm asking for is...

These hands, stained red
From the times that I've killed you and then
We can wash down this engagement ring
With poison and kerosene
We'll laugh, as we die
And we'll celebrate the end of things with cheap champagne

Without...
Without a sound
Without...
Without a sound
And I wish you away
Without a sound
And I wish you away
Without a sound, without a sound
And I wish you away
Without a sound, without a sound
And I wish you away
Without a sound, without a sound
And I wish you away
