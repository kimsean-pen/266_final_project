As she walks in the room
Scented and tall
Hesitating once more.
And as I take on myself
And the bitterness I felt
Realise that love flows...

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And my tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath

Will I follow?

Through the glory of life
I will scatter on the floor
Disappointed and sore.
And in my thoughts I have bled

For the riddles I've been fed
Another line is over-oh.
White horses
They will take me away
And my tenderness I feel

Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?
White horses
They will take me away
And my tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?
