The days assemble, what do I see?
A river running aside of me
Some have evaded men more will
We laid on the bank and had out feel

Stood my mind and it's how I feel
Warm me, when I need you touch me always

The years assemble, what do I see?
A cloud of memories out by me
A friend some lover, something enemies
Oh, I forgive them and I hope they forgive me

Still my heart is ill now I pray
Where she stormed by the ocean
Just left you away

The hard these years pass I'm letting go
The hard these years pass I'm letting go
The hard these years pass I'm letting go
The hard these years pass I'm letting go
