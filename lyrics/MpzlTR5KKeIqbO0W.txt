Maybe...
Maybe you saw your mother, maybe she's smiling
She hears your catching laughter
She's missed your charm
We never made it to Cooperstown
But I've still got that glove under my bed
Maybe I'll see you
We could shoot the shit, finally have a beer, finally have a catch
But for now its catch my tears, its catch my breath
I can just hear you say
Come on bud, get out of that funk
It's time to move on
It's funny how you still apply, you still know me
I'll try to take your tools and make something worth while
Try to make ya proud
I've learned nothing is spotless anymore
But I'll let you resonate
I'll let you resonate

Maybe your Heaven is that Norman Rockwell scene
Where you and your friends are singing that Gordon Lightfoot song
If you could only read my mind
If you could only read my mind

Read my mind

Well that ending, it was just too hard to take
Is it better than Clapton?
Did you see your fathers eyes?
I know it's wishful thinking
Hoping this won't always kill me
But if you saw yours
Then I'll see mine
You finally stretched your feet

Ghosted away from me
You had to leave

You had to fade away (you had to leave)
You had to fade away (you had to leave)
You had to fade away (you had to leave)
You had to fade away
You had to leave
I'm pleading for one more time with what I knew now
And I'm begging for the same flake to fall twice for the first time
I'm begging for what wasn't said
That night the snow shaped the land, and I walked home
I laughed the whole way 'cause I suppose
If it hurts it's worth it
But now that ghost is me
