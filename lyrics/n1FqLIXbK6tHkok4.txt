Black magic, black magic, black magic, black (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

You called enough (You called enough)
Her phone is ringing but it's me who's picking up (No, no)
You home-wrecker, this ain't no summer love
I made her block you, boy, you outta luck (Oh, oh)
You're outta luck

Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'ma hypnotize you, hit you with that voodoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Power of the full moon, won't say I forgive you
