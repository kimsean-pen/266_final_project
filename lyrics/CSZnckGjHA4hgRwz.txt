The fire, it cracks and the flakes snow on
November was white and December was gray
Well, someday soon when the spring brings the sun
I'll finally sleep, I'll finally

Feel better when the winter's gone
I'll feel better when the winter's gone
I'll feel better when the winter's gone, oh

These three months I've been inside the house
My pacing has worn all of the carpet out
Just give me a breeze, the rebirth of the life
I'll finally pine, I'll finally

I'll feel better when the winter's gone
I'll feel better when the winter's gone
I'll feel better when the winter's gone, oh

I'll feel better when the winter's gone
I'll feel better when the winter's gone
I'll feel better when the winter's gone, oh
