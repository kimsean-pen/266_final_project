Danny says we gotta go
gotta go to idaho,
but we can't go surfing
'cause its 20 below
Sound checks at 5 o' 2
record stores and interviews
oh but i can wait to be with you
tomorrow
Baby oh oh oh
we got nowhere to go--
and it may seem funny
but it's true uhu uhuu
Hanging out in 100 feet
watchin get smart on tv
thinkin about you and me and you and me
Hangin out in here
having nowhere to go o
i aint christmas if there aint no snow
listening to sheena on the radio
Danny says we gotta go
gotta go to idaho
but we cant go surfing
cause its 20 below
Baby oh oh oh
we got nowhere to go--
and it may seem funny
but it's true uhu uhuu
Hanging out in 100 feet
watchin get smart on tv
thinkin about you and me and you and me
Solo
Uh uh uh uh...
