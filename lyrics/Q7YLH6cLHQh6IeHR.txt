I wanna be, I wanna be wherever you are.
I was around, I was around from the start.
I've got you in my sights.
I want you there the rest of the night. And I'll say.

Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever? No.
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever? No.

I'll tie myself, I'll tie myself all into knots.
I get so lost, yeah I feel so lost in my own skin.
It might take time, it might take faith.
The things we build, they'll never break.
And there's some nights we're worlds apart.
Not this time, no goodbyes.

Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever? No.
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever? No.

We're the wild ones, we're the wild ones.
When you go, there's no one to lean on.
It's me, myself.
And we're the wild ones, we're the wild ones.
When you go, there's no one to lean on.
It's me, myself, and I.

You and I will go so far.
You and I will light the dark.
You're the better half of me.
You're the only half I need.

Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever? No.
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever? No.

We're the wild ones, we're the wild ones.
When you go, there's no one to lean on.
It's me, myself.
And we're the wild ones, we're the wild ones.
When you go, there's no one to lean on.
It's me, myself, and I.

Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
