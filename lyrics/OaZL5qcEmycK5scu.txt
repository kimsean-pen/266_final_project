System will slide it
Down upon
I can't tell you what
I think you're doing wrong

Stop your crying
Our daddy is gone
Do you remember when he
Used to sing us that little song?

I wasted my youth
On a poppy, du-du-du-du-du
Just for fun
I wasted my youth
On a poppy, du-du-du-du-du
Just because

Why you lyin'?
The Bourbon's gone
Mercury hasn't been in
Retrograde for that long
Oh no

Stop your hiding
And drop that bong
Do you remember when
I used to sing you this little song?

I wasted my youth
On a poppy, du-du-du-du-du
Just for fun
I wasted my youth
On a poppy, du-du-du-du-du
Just because

And everybody knows it's a tightrope
The cookie crumbles into dust
And everybody knows we're in trouble
Du-du-du-du-du, candy crush

Just 'cause you're young
Don't mean nothing
Don't mean nothing
We are here and we're gone
Do something while your heart is thumping

I wasted my youth
On a poppy, du-du-du-du-du
Just for because
I wasted my youth
On a poppy, du-du-du-du-du
Just for fun

And everybody knows it's a tightrope
The cookie crumbles into dust
And everybody knows we're in trouble
Du-du-du-du-du, candy crush

Wasted my youth
Wasted youth
Du-du-du-du-du
Wasted youth
Du-du-du-du-du
Wasted youth
Du-du-du-du-du
