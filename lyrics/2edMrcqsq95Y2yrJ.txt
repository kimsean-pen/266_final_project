Out of the tree of life, I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
The best is yet to come and babe won't it be fine
You think you've seen the sun but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up is underway, wait till our lips have met
Wait till you see that sunshine day, you ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe won't it be fine
The best is yet to come, come the day your mine
Come the day your mine, I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine, we're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before but you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace, wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place, there ain't nothin' like it here
The best is yet to come and babe won't it be fine
The best is yet to come, come the day your mine
Come the day your mine, I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine, we're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before but you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace, wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place, there ain't nothin' like it here
The best is yet to come and babe won't it be fine
The best is yet to come, come the day your mine
Come the day your mine, come the day your mine
The best is yet to come
