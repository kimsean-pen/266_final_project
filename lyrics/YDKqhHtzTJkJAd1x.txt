It's the higher love, higher love
The one I have for you
It's the higher love, the higher love
And it's all because of you
From a rock to a diamond in the end
From a glacier to a monsoon
It's the higher love, the higher love
The one I have for you, for you
The one I have for you, yeah
(Higher love, higher)

We were too hot, we melted off
A kiss turned into night in daytime
It's been forever since I felt forever
But my words didn't come out, we
We were too high, we had to fall
Before I knew who you were at all
Lonely is the heart that longs for love
That never came to life
That's why I
Higher love for you, higher love
The one I have for you
It's the higher love, the higher love
And it's all because of you
From a rock to a diamond in the end
From a glacier to a monsoon
It's the higher love, the higher love
Days are getting darker now
You sure you should let me go
Winter's on its way
If you're cold, I could melt the snow
Our summer's over
It feels like seasons ago
You couldn't picture four seasons with me
Just a month or so, I don't know
Now I just look for fake versions of you
I jump every time
They don't act like you do
Act like you do, uh
It seems no one can get me the way like us two
(Higher love)

I wish I was you
I will make sure we good
Good, good, good, we're good
I would make sure we good

Lonely is the heart that longs for love
That never came to life
That's why I have this

Higher love for you, higher love
The one I have for you
It's the higher love, the higher love
And it's all because of you
From a rock to a diamond in the end
From a glacier to a monsoon
It's the higher love, the higher love
