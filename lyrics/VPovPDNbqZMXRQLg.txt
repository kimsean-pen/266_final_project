If you're having troubles babe hit them with beams
You've got 99 problems and all of them dreams.
Life will give you something like an ebb or a flow
Stare them right in the eyes, babe, and give it a go.

Oh don't you shy away your heart beats the day
Oh time is not alone with you.

Oh don't you shy away your heart beats the day
Oh time is not alone with you.
Oh don't you shy away your heart beats the day
Oh time is not alone with you.
Oh don't you shy away your heart beats the day
Oh time is not alone with you.
