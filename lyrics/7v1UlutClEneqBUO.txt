There was a point of no return
And I never looked back
Till i was holding your hand
And I'm socially absurd
But who cares

Yea I've been shaking with withdrawals
I'm a junky loser
I never would choose to live the way I do
But I do

I'll be your angel
I'll be your best friend
Take me to New York
Take me to heaven

He's a teen
A teenager in love
He's a teen
A teenager in love

What a tragic attraction
What's the point of romance
He's a teen
A teenager in love
I'm a fool with a goose and a crush
What a magic distraction what's the point of romance
I never wanted to be a teenager in love

There was a point when we were cool
And it never went bad until you are holding his hand
And I couldnt say a word
But who cares
And I've been talking to myself
Making up a new plan I will get you back
It'll probably never work
And I'm screwed

I'll be your angel
I'll be your best friend
I'm in my bedroom
Let's go to heaven

He's a teen
A teenager in love
He's a teen
A teenager in love

What a tragic attraction
What's the point of romance
He's a teen
A teenager in love
I'm a fool with a goose and a crush
What a magic distraction what's the point of romance
I never wanted to be a teenager in love

I don't wanna go out
I just wanna sit inside my bedroom
And obsess everything I've said to you
Your love is like a roller coaster you couldn't make to ride if you tried

He's a teen
A teenager in love
He's a teen
A teenager in love

What a tragic attraction
What's the point of romance
He's a teen
A teenager in love
I'm a fool with a goose and a crush
What a magic distraction what's the point of romance

I never wanted to be a teenager in love
What's the point of romance
I never wanted to be a teenager in love
What's the point of romance (In love)
