I don't lie
I love you all
I do
And to all of you guessing
Just tell that I'm betting to stall
It's true

We will capture you in open arms
When you're tired and alone

My life is better than it ever was
My life is better than it ever was

And I'll give blood to your dry veins
We do this for the passion and not the fashion or fame

We will capture you
In open arms
When you're tired and alone

My life is better than it ever was
My life is better than it ever was

This could be your home when you're all alone
Tired and desperate
My life is better than it ever was

To all the crowded rooms that say you gave me a home anyway
To all the crowded rooms that say you gave me a home anyway
To all the crowded rooms that say you gave me a home anyway
To all the crowded rooms that say you gave me a home anyway

I'll give blood to your dry veins
I'll give blood to your dry veins (To your dry veins) (I'll give blood)
To all the crowded rooms that say (To your dry veins)
To all the crowded rooms that say (You gave me a home anyway)

My life is better than it ever was
My life is better than it ever was

This could be your home when you're all alone
Tired and desperate
This could be your home when you're all alone
Tired and desperate
