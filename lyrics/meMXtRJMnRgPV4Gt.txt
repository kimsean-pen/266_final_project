sweet life I know
how we give it all
hold me up
hold me up into the sun and watch me burn
come undone
it can come apart when everything seems lost
its insane
how I try to find what to believe in

its a mad life that we know
and I try to see the beauty all around
its a mad life that we know
still we give it all

hold me up
when I try to give and all I get is hurt
its okay
that I feel faded today
and lord I know
that I can find some peace
in this world
in this world

its a mad life that we know
an I try to see the beauty all around
its a mad life that we know
will we give it all away

sweet life I know
will it fade away
sweet life I know
can we give enough before we come undone
before we come undone
I'm waiting for the love to come around
and save us from ourselves

its a mad life that we know
and I try to see the beauty all around
its a mad life that we know
still we give it all

see the pain and beauty all around
see it try so hard to take me down
hold me up into the sun and watch me burn and watch me heal
how I Need someone to know that I feel faded today
