I'm wide awake and
You look perfect next to me
This photograph
I look so deep
Sometimes I hear you breathe
I'm here alone
Tryin' to hang onto my soul
But the distance takes it toll
You know, you know

I'm out here doin' all I can
You make me everything I am
Give me strength to get through somehow
I keep praying that it won't be long now

There'll come a day
When I can hold you and say
It's forever
There'll come a day
When these broken lives
Fade back together
There'll come a day
When we won't feel like this
I'll find my way
There'll come a day

I've seen enough things
That I wish I could erase
I shut my eyes and take myself back
To a safer place
Where I can live the life
You left behind
But as long as you're still mine
All mine, all mine

I'm out here doin' all I can
You make me everything I am
Give me strength to get through somehow
I keep praying that it won't be long now

There'll come a day
When I can hold you and say
It's forever
There'll come a day
When these broken lives
Fade back together
There'll come a day
When we won't feel like this
I'll find my way
There'll come a day

I've stood for all that I believe in
Time now to start healing
And take back the stolen time
And take back my life

I'm out here doin' all I can
You make me everything I am
Give me strength to get through somehow
I keep praying that it won't be long now

There'll come a day
When I can hold you and say
It's forever
There'll come a day
When these broken lives
Fade back together
There'll come a day
When we won't feel like this
I'll find my way
There'll come a day
Oh, there'll come a day
Oh, there'll come a day
I won't lose faith
I'm wide awake and
You look perfect next to me
