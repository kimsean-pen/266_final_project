Spend my money on a chain
It's dangling around my neck
I'm still trying to get a ring
(Trying to get a ring)
Only got one quarter left
She said money ain't a thing, she said money ain't a thing
(Money ain't a thing)
I still wanna make a scene, wanna make a scene,
(Wanna make a scene)

We can get high
We can get low
We can go all night
We can take it slow
We don't need a lot
No we don't
We got what we got
Pockets full of no

I got purple in my veins
Call that royal blood
And I'm still working every day
Tryna make this club go up

She don't really care about material things
I throw it in the air, the American Dream whoa

We can get high
We can get low
We can go all night
We can take it slow
We don't need a lot
No we don't
We got what we got
Pockets full of no

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na

We're all on these silly little paths tryna run around and grab shit
We all need just a little more green and a little less plastic
(A little less plastic)

We can get high
We can get low
We can go all night
We can take it slow
We don't need a lot
No we don't
We got what we got
Pockets full of no

We got pockets full of no
Ain't got a dollar to my name
Do you wanna good time with me girl?
Just let me know
We got pockets full of no
I ain't got a dollar to my name
Hey, do you wanna go I know baby we can go
We don't need a lot
