We said goodbye by the train
She said "don't you overthink a whole deal"
Momma please don't drink
I said "don't worry baby girls, let me think"
Your straight A's and [?]
Black and white they go together nicely babe
So what's the sudden change?
Well, I love you just the same

If you are my fire, fire
Please let me love again
Let there be water, water
Before I go off and faint

Well, you say how you love me
Let me go, if you love me
Let me go, if you love me
Love me so, let me go
Let me go

If lovin' is an art
Let a stud unbreak these broken hearts
From the light into the dark
Now it's tearing us apart

If you are my fire, fire
Please let me love again
Let there be water, water
Before I go off and faint

Well, you say how you love me
Let me go, if you love me
Let me go, if you love me
Love me so, let me go
Let me go

Well, you say how you love me
Let me go, if you love me
Let me go, if you love me
Love me so, let me go
Let me go

Cause you are my fire, fire
Please let me love again
Let there be water, water
Before I go off and faint

Well, you say how you love me
Let me go, if you love me
Let me go, if you love me
Love me so, let me go
Let me go

Well, you say how you love me
Let me go, if you love me
Let me go, if you love me
Love me so, let me go
Let me go

Let me go, if you love me
Let me go, if you love me
Love me so, let me go
Let me go
