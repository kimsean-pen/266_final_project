Fire, fire, the bridge is on fire
Burning away your last connection
Fire, fire, our bridge is on fire
Your social skills resemble arson

You seem okay with this
So deleterious
Remorse for you is not an option

What's the matter, Beavis?

Why you gotta burn, gotta burn it all down?

What's the matter, Beavis?

Burning it all down
Burn down all the bridges

Fire, fire, shit's on fire
Beavis sure do love his matches

Choking on the smoke from the fire you've started
Choking on the ash from the bridges you've burned
Choking on the smoke from the fire you've started
Choking on the ash from the bridges you've burned

Daddy didn't love you, gotta burn it all down
What's the matter, Beavis?
Not the better brother, gotta burn it all down
What's the matter, Beavis?
Why you gotta burn, gotta burn it all down?
Why you gotta burn, gotta burn it all down?
Why you gotta burn, gotta burn it all down?
Not the better brother, gotta burn it all down

Choking on the smoke from the fire you've started
Choking on the ash from the bridges you've burned

Choking on the smoke from the fire you've started
Choking on the ash from the bridges you've burned
