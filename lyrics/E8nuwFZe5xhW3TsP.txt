I took my black teeth down to the sea
Brother of mine
I washed myself in your steely gaze

We read your name o'er jaguar hide
Brother of mine
You saw terminus and bruised your knees

I lashed their bodies to the wheeling suns
Brother of mine
You tossed wet bluebirds in the air

I sensed the whetstone's dark embrace
Brother of mine
Tender and rude like tiger skinned

We once were lechers, rakes and rogues
Mother of mine
You're coming through

We swallowed truncheon, shield and child
Sister of mine
You're coming through

We spoke with sinners, snakes, and slaves
Daughter of mine
You're coming through
