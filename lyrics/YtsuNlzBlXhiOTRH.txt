Both knees, I saw you grazing at the floor
Nosebleeds, there's always more to your one more
Sheer delight as you unwind, as you unwind
I think I saw some self belief through gritted teeth tonight

Fall over, we don't need another drink
Fall over, this goes more quickly then you think
A sugar cube in water: is that all you think this is?
Your life in your fingertips

And what was that you said?
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
Just one match to burn this whole thing down
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
Just one match to burn this whole thing down

Stop signs, they're blood red, you're color-blind
Your lifeline weaves and snakes around your every whim
Not rehabilitation, call it learning how to swim
We're just learning how to swim

And what was that you said?
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
Just one match to burn this whole thing down
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
Just one match to burn down

Everything you promise is swept up by the wind
And I could try to love you, but where do I begin?

And what was that you said?
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
We are so lonely
Just one match to burn, burn, burn

And everything you promise is swept up by the wind
And I could try to love you, but where do I begin?
