HEAVINESS OF THE LOAD

You're little heavy
Of your droppin down load.
You're thinkin of your influence
With a right to unload.
Cuz you're ready for your tenure
And the droppin down disease.
There's somethin in your influence
Take the right to unleash.

Your whistle rolly
Sneakin up behind me.
I'm goin lots o' lonely
But never gonna know it.
You're the one that takes it to the.
