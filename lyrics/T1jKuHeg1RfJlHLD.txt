Everywhere I go no one says no to me
They don't, they don't dare
They're everything I want to feel
The good, the bad, always indifferent
Be my muse before I walk all over you
To get to the next one

You were fascinated like a fool
And I layed down and killed you
You're calling me insatiable and I can't deny
On the heart for the irreplaceable
Impossible to find
Should I settle for less
You're good but I want the best

I want you along with the rest
I want the world with no consequences
Drink it up and be so mad and wild

Along with me to the ending
Pray to set you free
Cuz I'll give you the hurt they gave it to me
You're calling me insatiable and I can't deny
On the heart for the irreplaceable
Impossible to find
Should I settle for less

You're good but I want the best
I want you along with the rest
I want the world with no consequences
Should I settle for less

You're good but I want the best
I want you along with the rest
I want the world with no consequences
Should I settle for less

You're good but I want the best
I want you along with the rest
I want the world with no consequences
(Everywhere I go no one says no to me) Should I settle for less
(They don't, they don't dare) You're good but I want the best
(They're everything I want to feel) I want you along with the rest
(The good, the bad, always indifferent) I want the world with no consequences
