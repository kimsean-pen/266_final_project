Bloodhounds tied in seaweed,
Bloodhounds in green chains,
Picnic on the river, witness claimed,
Hair was found at the foot of the woods,
One watcher knew it well,
Pushing through the line of the cops,
To get closer.

All I wanna do is be tied to you,
Terror through each quiet night,
Up and then I'm down thinking I'm dying,
Then back up where I forget.

Sicker than I've ever been, these nightmares I'm having.
