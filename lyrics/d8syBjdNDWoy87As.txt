Door bells say goodbye to the last train
Over the river they all go again
Out into leafy nowhere
Hope someone's waiting out there
For them

Cabbie has his mind on a fare to the sun
He works nights but it's not much fun
Picks up the London yo yo's
All on their own down soho
Take me home

Other people wouldn't like to hear you
If you said
That these are the best days
Of our lives

Other people turn around and laugh at you
If you said
That these are the best days
Of our lives

Trellick Tower's been calling
I know she'll leave me in the morning

In hotel cells listening to dial tones
Remote controls and cable moans
Door bells say goodbye to the last train
Gets disconnected sleepwalking back home

Other people wouldn't like to hear you
If you said
That these are the best days
Of our lives

Other people turn around and laugh at you
If you said
That these are the best days
Of our lives
Of our lives

Other people wouldn't like to hear you
If you said
That these are the best days
Of our lives

Other people turn around and laugh at you
If you said
That these are the best days
Of our lives

Other people break into a cold sweat
If you said
That these are the best days
Of their lives

And other people turn around and laugh at you
If you said
That these are the best days
Of our lives
Of our lives.
