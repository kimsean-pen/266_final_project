INTRO:
Come on come one
Ooh yeh
Ooh oh

1:
Come to me
And I'll surrender my love to you
Give in to your dreams
And remember my love is true

Come, we'll explore
Forbidden passions together

CHORUS:
Oh baby
I surrender my love to you (surrender)
Oh baby
Just remember my love is true (surrender)

Just remember, just remember

Time is right to be together
My love with you (surrender)
Not just for one night but forever (surrender)

Come, take my hand
Let me show you everything

CHORUS:
Oh baby
I surrender my love to you (surrender)
Oh baby
Just remember my love is true (surrender)

Oh baby
I surrender my love to you (surrender)
Oh baby
Just remember my love is true (surrender)

BRIDGE:
Oh, hold me close
And we can ride together
Oh, you and I lust to love
Magic moments forever

Come to me
Come come come to me (surrender)
Come to me
Come come come to me
(Surrender my love surrender)

CHORUS:
(repeat & fade)
