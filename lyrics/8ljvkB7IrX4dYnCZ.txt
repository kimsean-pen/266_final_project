Try to make yourself completly dumb
Live this live whit stile to make you strong
This is not my favorite way
Try to hit that little space

ooooooo

Whitout money, whitout love
Trust me baby it's so fun

Try to make yourself completly dumb
Live this life so high to make you strong
This is not my favorite way
Try to hit that little space

ooooooo

Whitout money, whitout love
Trust me baby it's so fun
Do something wrong
No money, no love

So take me and if you don't kill me baby
Let's get it on, do whitout hope
I can find you honey, in this six mondays
I want much better, love doesn't matter
