Tell me I'm wrong and I'm yours
It's easy to change and you know I would
If I only could
Tell me again
Why I must
When everything hurts
Insulting like you
And then there's you

I can't see much throwing up hate
And everything's strange
I once owned a store
It's all next door
I've given a lot this year
I want you to hear
Salt and gook
You deserve that one

My mistress my mistress
Take me home again
My mistress, my mistress
Bring me home again
My mistress,, my mistress
Take me home again
My mistress, my mistress
Bring me home again
My mistress, my mistress
Take me home again

My mistress my mistress
Take me home again
My mistress, my mistress
Bring me home again
My mistress,, my mistress
Take me home again
My mistress, my mistress
