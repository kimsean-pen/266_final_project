Best of luck don't run amok
We all get tongue tied
Keep your chin up don't get accustomed
You're allowed to backslide

The only God is slowly ere on
The other side of love
Teenage story in it's glory
God, it's never quite enough

My sun dried, baby
Permanently limp
Quiet restraint takes such accomplishments
This insight fading crutch analogy
Quiet restraint takes all the best in me

And you can tell them you're the girl
Who sold her magic for the world
One day, babe, you'll be mine
And I'll be hers and we'll be fine

And I will turn those screams to rhymes
And I'll be catching it each time

My sun dried, baby
Permanently limp
Quiet restraint takes such accomplishments
This insight fading crutch analogy
Quiet restraint takes all the best in me

Who's to say that you won't find love again?
Who's to say that you won't find love?
Who's to say that you won't find love if I cut off my hands and make you clean it up?

Who's to say that you won't find love again?
Who's to say that you won't find love?
Who's to say that you won't find love if I cut off my hands and make you clean it up?

My sun dried, baby

Who's to say that you won't find love again?
