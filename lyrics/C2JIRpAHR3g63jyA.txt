See the curtains hangin' in the window
Evening on a Friday night
A little light shinin' in the window
Lets me know everything's all right

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

See the paper lyin' on the sidewalk
Music from the house next door
So I walk on up to the door step
Through the screen and across the floor

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playin' her tune
When I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waitin' there, I don't care, don't care in this world

See the smile awaitin' in the kitchen
Food cookin' and it's plates for two
Feel your arms reachin' out to love me
In the evening, day is through

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
