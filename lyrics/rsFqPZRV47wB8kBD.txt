Endure the pain, you know my name
I am your soul insane
I am no one, no one who cares
I am your soul despair

Your fear deceives, vulnerability
Leaving an easy prey
Consume your mind, a power so divine
Will take you and rape you blind

Gemini, master of demise
Your death is my salvation to a kingdom mine
My lord is my light, the master of darkness
Your death is my salvation to a kingdom mine

You look at me with eyes of fate and see the graphic truth
Your ignorance cannot shield you from your naked abuse
Numbing of your moral sense, facing reality
That life is unconditional and death is only the beginning

The pain will never end!

Walking slow, breathing heavy, you could see death sweat
How it shined, an argument out of control in my mind
I am here for the sole purpose of your death
Walking slow breathing heavy, you can see death sweat
I am here for the sole purpose of your death
Look into my eyes and see the revelation of your demise
Feel the pain that stares at the center of your heart
Reflections of my soul, reflections of the dark
