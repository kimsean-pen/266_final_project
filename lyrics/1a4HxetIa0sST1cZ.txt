(Hey, I know, I know, I know
Hey, I know, I know, I know)

There has always been a part of me
That runs to dark
It's like I'm afraid to be
Myself for a start
But there's somethin' about ya babe
Where there is no age
No playin' games this time
This love isn't staged

Hey, I know, I know, I know
It's easy to say, that we'll play it safe

Oh and now I gotta
Use my head, too many times I lost my mind
I lose myself, this time around boy I'ma just use my
Use my head, too many times I lost my mind
I lose myself, this time around boy I just gotta use my

Head
Use my
Head
Use my

Nothin' is perfect here
We question ourselves
Tryna be who we're supposed to be
But the tryin' don't help
'Cause I've always been caged by those
Who offer their help
Things only fall into place
When I think for myself
Gotta use my

Hey, I know, I know, I know
It's easy to say, that we'll play it safe

Oh and now I gotta Use my head
Too many times I lost my mind
I lose myself
This time around boy, imma just use my
Use my head

Oh and now I gotta
Use my head, too many times I lost my mind
I lose myself, this time around boy I'ma just use my
Use my head, too many times I lost my mind
I lose myself, this time around boy I just gotta use my

Head
Use my
Head
Use my

Like a yan without a yin
A saint without the sinner
Someone without a friend
Are we just fuckin'?
Or is it more?
I just gotta know
Is it more?
I just gotta use my
Use my head

Use my head, too many times I lost my mind
I lose myself, this time around boy I'ma just use my
Use my head, too many times I lost my mind
I lose myself, this time around boy I just gotta use my

Head
Use my
Head
Head
Use my
Head
