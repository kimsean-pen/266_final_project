They can say the most wonderful words you just don't understand
I can show you the way but I know that you'll never be there
All the time, all the shine of your eyes I would never forget
All I know there's no time, there's no life, there is no turning back
There is no turning back
There is no turning back

They can say the most wonderful words you just don't understand
I can show you the way but I know that you'll never be there
All the time, all the shine of your eyes I would never forget
All I know there's no time, there's no life, there is no turning back
There is no turning back
There is no turning back
