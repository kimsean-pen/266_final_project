You're embarrassing me
With a postponed marriage and this stalled out car
Then you leave me in the back
With half a window rolled down
Like a dog
Like a dog in the summer heat

Don't you think? Don't you think?
You should try to do as little harm as you can
To the woman that loves you

Oh, we'll stay
Oh, we'll stay together for the weekend
Honey the weekend, babe
Me and you, frosted blue
But we're gazing out for better things

You should try to do as little harm as you can
To the woman that loves you
