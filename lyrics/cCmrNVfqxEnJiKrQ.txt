Any old revolution just won't do
Let's put an end to war and start a new
Any old revolution just won't do
Let's put an end to war and start a new

Penny lane, the pipers gone, I saw the photograph
Neither you nor I can tell what Heaven knows
I told my bestest friend name, Mickey, girl
We're really living in a sicky world

I wish I had the right solution
'Cause any old revolution won't do
A revolution, a revolution won't do
A revolution, a revolution won't do

Have mercy beat, he sits with his wife at the Sushi bar
Sipping sake to their heart's content, oh no
Go tell his friend the Maharishi, sheesh
Somebody blew away the sixties peace

We need a moral contribution
'Cause any old revolution won't do
A revolution, a revolution won't do
A revolution, a revolution won't do

Come together
Oh yeah
Come together
Oh yeah

Rubber soul, look at the killer, he's just standing there
Reading captions from the 'Catcher in the Rye'
It didn't take too many dollars, no
To get his hands on a revolver blow

We need a whole new constitution
'Cause any old revolution won't do
A revolution, a revolution won't do
A revolution, a revolution won't do

Pepperland, there must be a toe jam working joo joo on his brain
If not, then why do I feel so all alone?
I saw a thousand different candles die
Dakota station, we've been scandaled, why?

I wish I had the right solution
'Cause any old revolution won't do
This situation's gotten
Too far out of hand

We need a moral contribution
'Cause any old revolution won't do
We've got to make a stand
Stand up and throw up your hands

Why must they kill all of our leaders?
We've got a long, long way to go
He only wanted to let peace shine through
Any old revolution, no it just won't do, no

A revolution, a revolution won't do
Not just any revolution
A revolution, a revolution won't do
I'm here to talk about the constitution

A revolution, a revolution won't do
You know we need a moral contribution, help me
Revolution, constitution
Bump it, just sing
