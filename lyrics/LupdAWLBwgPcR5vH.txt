Our burden fell down
Once shared but waged war on my mind
So told my love farewell now
No loyalty to find
When

You vanish over the skies
I am forsaken
Beneath the ground I lie
Was banished from this hurtful life
I am forlorn
All dreams have turned to strife

Winter winds take flight
Circling over my grave
A haunting voice amidst the trees
Rising up across the sea

Survival
It was destined for your name
Compassion
Brings you here when the rain falls on mine
