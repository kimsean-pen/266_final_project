I still can't get over the sex we had
Let me tell you about my girl, God help me
She had a finger wave, and disco veins, and spaceship lips
I said: "Houston, I've landed, let's go steady"

On Saturday, she seemed different
She turned and kissed another girl

And she's in love with her
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, oh, and now I know tonight she ain't mine

She's got a girl crush
She thinks I'm famous
I guess I'm close enough to be dangerous

I still can't remember where we met that night
But there were Coney Island freaks surfing cocaine
And when the wave crashed down and a full black moon out
I said: "You're the only cat on my runway"

She had me hook, line and sinker
Maybe she thinks I'm just a girl

But I'm in love with her
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, she's so, so bad, it hurts
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, I hang my head and cry
Aye-ye-ye-ye
Girl, all because I know tonight that she ain't mine

She's got a girl crush
She thinks I'm famous
I guess I'm close enough to be dangerous
She's got a girl crush
She thinks I'm famous
I guess I'm close enough to be dangerous

Let me see your gold tooth
(I don't even know you)
Hot butter in your perfume
(I'm about to show you)
Psycho candy voodoo
(Take it to the bathroom)
Bang, bang, bang bang, bangarang

Girl, I think I'm in love with both of them
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, oh, I can play innocent
Girl, they're all in love with her
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, she's so, so bad, it hurts
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, I hang my head and cry
Aye-ye-ye-ye
Girl, oh, because I know tonight she ain't mine
Girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, oh, and now I know tonight she ain't mine
