Everybody knows that
I'm coming for you tough
I'm coming for you tough

Everybody knows

I'm coming for you tough

Are you scared, don't you run now
Welcome to the fun house
Tossed my emotions, so
Here's the commotion, oh

Feels good to hold the knife
Cut me out just right
Revenge and a kiss
'Cause, baby, I'm a snitch

Hush, hush, hush
You know I'm coming for you
Tough, tough, tough
I need your love in a
Rush, rush, rush
You better take over this quiet storm

Hush, hush, hush
You know I'm coming for you
Tough, tough, tough
I need your love in a
Rush, rush, rush
You better take over this quiet storm

Everybody knows
Everybody knows that
I'm coming for you tough
I'm coming for you tough

Everybody knows
Everybody knows that
I'm coming for you tough
I'm coming for you tough

You won't get saved
Hold your breath, it's okay
'Cause you're drowning today
I'm gonna shake it up

It's gonna be fun
I got a little something
Sure there'll be some pain
I'll be happy I came

Hush, hush, hush
You know I'm coming for you
Tough, tough, tough
I need your love in a
Rush, rush, rush
You better take over this quiet storm

Hush, hush, hush
You know I'm coming for you
Tough, tough, tough
I need your love in a
Rush, rush, rush
You better take over this quiet storm

Don't you say one more thing to me
Won't you shut it up, you can't explain

Hush, hush, hush
You know I'm coming for you
Tough, tough, tough
I need your love in a
Rush, rush, rush
You better take over this quiet storm

Hush, hush, hush
