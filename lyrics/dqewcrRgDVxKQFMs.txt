Take from me
What you need
Tambourine
Yeah you can't play but there's a fee
Watch your own, mama bleed
You're like a dog, withouth the teeth
You start to play, you're playing slow
They start to die, you're playing more
I've seen Gods, die in you

Welcome to the Orchestra
They try to put they drugs in me
Give me blinds so i can read
The story in front of me
They don't want none of me
I am a doll upon a string
