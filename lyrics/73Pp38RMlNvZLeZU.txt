What's forbidden
Is a treasure hidden
I got a clue
On the trail of finding all about you

Ask for trouble
A piece of the puzzle
When i saw you
So many locks and keys and chains shield you

Two hearts crash inside your bench
When the suffering does commence
Jolly Roger run up the mask
? And the seconds of love in his past

What's forbidden
As been boldly written
I found you
In the tasting core of the sweeting fruit
Confusing reign supreme
When the promises are repeat
Tender hook of the Tiger Trap
Lost on the edge of the treasure map
Cover the wicked ways
? say?
The spoils of love renewed
Still im on the trail of finding all about you

? What's forbidden
? As been boldly written
When i saw you... when i saw you (repeated)
