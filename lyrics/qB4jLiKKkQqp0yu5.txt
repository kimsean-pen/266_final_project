We can see you through the end
Always wrong always undermined
Let the shadows fade away
And come with me inside

Let the shadows fade away
Let the shadows fade away
Come with me inside
Let the shadows fade away
Let the shadows fade away

Let the shadows fade away
Let the shadows fade away
Come with me inside
Come with me inside

We can see you through the end
Always wrong always undermined
Let the shadows fade away
And come with me inside

Let the shadows fade away
Let the shadows fade away
