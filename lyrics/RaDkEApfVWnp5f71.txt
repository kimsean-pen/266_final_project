Mornings alone
When you come home I breathe a little faster

Every time we're together
It never be the same if you're not here
How can you stay away, away so long?
Why can't we stay together
Just give me a reason, give me a reason

'Cause I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you
I, I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss

It's just another day without you
It's just another day
Ohh, making the time
Find the right lines to make you stay forever
What do I have to tell you?

Just trying to hold on to something
Give us a chance to make it, to make it
No, no, no, wanna hold on to never
I'm not that strong, I'm not that strong
I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you, no

I, I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you, no

Why can't you stay forever?
Just give me a reason, give me a reason
'Cause I, I don't wanna say it

I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you

I, I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you
I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you
I, I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you
