The first time I realized I was living in this world
I was probably looking at the sky
and forgive me but I don't know if I remember enough to say
what the air was really like that day

may have been clouds
or something
I don't recall
I was young

and the next time I realized I was breathing in the life
was the first time that I saw your face
I wanted you but I don't know if I was brave enough to say how the sight of you messed up my mind
I got scared, right away, and okay, right away.

the next thing I knew the stars were eyes up in the night
and the ocean breathing heavy like a beast
I held you but I don't know if I was strong enough to say how the way it felt messed up my mind

may have been clouds
or something
I don't recall
I was young

may have been clouds
or something
I don't recall
I was young

may have been clouds
or something
I don't recall
I was young

may have been clouds
or something
I don't recall
I was young
