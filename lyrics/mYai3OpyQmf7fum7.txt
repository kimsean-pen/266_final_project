Everyone is here except for me
And I can feel the world is watching
Who is on their own I wonder?
And who has cast this spell I'm under?

I want you with me
I want you with me

Look into your heart are you happy?
You could be the one to set me free
And with your hand in mine we will run
To a place that knows no one

I want you with me
I want you with me
I want you with me

I won't forget the things you said
They're dancing and singing inside my head
You've always known you're not alone

I want you with me
I want you with me
I want you with me
I want you with me
