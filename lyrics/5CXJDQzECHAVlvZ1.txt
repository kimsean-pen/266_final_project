Sun, It goes away
Another day
Another day
You, you know of me
And I know you
But they know you too
I've told you once, once before
When you were here, at my door
At my door
Don't let this go
They will hurt you
Just come with me
They hurt me too
So what can I say?
When I see your face
This Isn't okay
I know you don't care
But this is so hard
So hard
I don't know what happens now
Why can't we just spin now this around
don't make a sound
I've done this all
It's all for you
You can't deny
That this parts true
So true
