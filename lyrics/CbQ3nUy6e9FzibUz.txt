Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh

My new boy used to be a model
He looks way better than you
He looks way better than you

My new boy gets it how to get me
His love is deeper, you know
He's a real keeper, you know, oh

Bang, bang, bang, I'm breaking in
Stealing all my love back, giving it to him
Bang, bang, bang, this time I win
I thought your love was all that until I let him in

You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one that's moping

You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
When I'm out having fun
You're gonna be the one that's broken

My new boy knows the way I want it
He's got more swagger than you
He's got more swagger than you, do

My new boy really likes to flaunt this
He's not hiding me, you know
He's showing me off, you know, oh

Bang, bang, bang, I'm breaking in
Stealing all my love back, giving it to him
Bang, bang, bang, this time I win
I thought your love was all that until I let him in

You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one that's moping

You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
When I'm out having fun
You're gonna be the one that's broken

I hope you slip and fall
And trip all over my heart
And just lay there alone
Yeah, you got what you wanted

On your hands and knees
Grasping for air, grasping for me
Baby, don't hold your breath
I've moved on to the next

Woah
On to the next one
On to the next one

Woah
On to the next one
On to the next one

Bang, bang, bang, I'm breaking in
Stealing all my love back, giving it to him
Bang, bang, bang, this time I win
I thought your love was all that until I let him in

You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one that's moping

You're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one
When I'm out having fun
You're gonna be the one that's broken

Bang, bang, bang, I'm breaking in
Stealing all my love back, giving it to him
Bang, bang, bang, this time I win
I thought your love was all that until I let him in
