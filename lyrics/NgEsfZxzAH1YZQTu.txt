I always spend summer nights by myself
A little glass of wine and some tunes to waste my time
With the moon that shines and the stars that call my name
I've got a feeling this summer won't be the same

Oh baby, stay here tonight
Oh darling, hold me tight
I don't wanna be alone
But this summer night I have a man of my own

I've got a feeling this summer won't be the same
Oh baby, stay here Tonight
Oh Darling, hold me tigh
I don't want be Alone
But this summer night I have a man of my own...
