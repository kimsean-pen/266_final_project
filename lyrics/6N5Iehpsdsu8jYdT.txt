I want all my people around me
Everybody living good
Everybody eatin good
Everybody chillin
I want all my people around me
Everybody eatin good
Everybody living good
I want for my brother what I want for myself

Sun is shining, the air is clear
Folks are smiling, no need for fear
The kids are learning what they should learn
Finally folks are earning what they should earn

I want all my people around me
Everybody living good
Everybody eatin good
Everybody chillin
I want all my people around me
Everybody eatin good
Everybody living good
I want for my brother what I want for myself

If there's enough for one, there's enough for two
It starts with me and it starts with you
It's complicated but it's simple too
Just like patience, sharing is a virtue
Show folks where you stand
Lend a hand, when you can, to your fellow man
Over plan for the day when you can't work the way you used to

I want all my people around me
Everybody living good
Everybody eatin good
Everybody chillin
I want all my people around me
Everybody eatin good
Everybody living good
I want for my brother what I want for myself
All my people, yeah
