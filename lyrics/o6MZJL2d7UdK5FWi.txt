Now what a disgrace, the world was in your grasp
Believe the words they say, you live through your past
So here you wait for a feeling of control
Numb to the emotion of the heart that you once stole

Death, you'll be feeling so dark and alone
Once you burn with the sun you won't shine so bright
As you fade into the ash
As you fade into the ash

Slip into disappointment, never be enough
Search for perfection, you will find disgust
All those who love you, liars, fakes and thieves
Want what you can give, fall to your knees

Death, you'll be feeling so dark and alone
Once you burn with the sun you won't shine so bright
As you fade into the ash
As you fade into the ash
Fade into the ash
Fade into the ash

Now what a disgrace, the world was in your grasp
Believe the words they say, you live through your past
So here you wait for a feeling of control
Numb to the emotion of the heart that you once stole

Death, you'll be feeling so dark and alone
Once you burn with the sun you won't shine so bright
As you fade into the (ash)
Death, you'll be feeling so dark and alone
Once you burn with the sun you won't shine so bright
As you fade into the ash
