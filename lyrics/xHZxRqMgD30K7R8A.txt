I still hear your voice
When you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dreams
Forgive me my weakness
But I dont know why
Without you it's hard to survive

'Cause everytime we touch
I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last
Need you by my side

'Cause everytime we touch
I feel the static
And everytime we kiss
I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat slow?
I can't let you go
I want you in my life

Your arms are my castle
Your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I've cried
The good and the bad times
We've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall

'Cause everytime we touch
I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last
Need you by my side

'Cause everytime we touch
I feel the static
And everytime we kiss
I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat slow?
I can't let you go
I want you in my life

'Cause everytime we touch
I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last
Need you by my side
