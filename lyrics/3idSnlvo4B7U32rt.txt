She took me off my guard with disappointment
I got sucked inside of her apartment
She's got dried up flowers, flakey skin
A beaded necklace and a bottle of gin

She's a nitemare hippy girl
With her skinny fingers fondlin' my world
She's a whimsical, tragical beauty
Self-conscious and a little bit moody

It's a new-age letdown in my face
She's so spaced out, and there ain't no space
She's got marijuana on the bathroom tile
I'm caught in a vortex, she's changing my style

She's a nitemare hippy girl
With her skinny fingers fondlin' my world
She's a whimsical, tragical beauty
Uptight and a little bit snooty

She's a magical, sparkling tease
She's a rainbow choking the breeze
Yeah oh, she's busting out onto the scene
With nitemare bogus poetry

She's a melted avocado on the shelf
She's the science of herself
She's spazzing out on a cosmic level
And she's meditating with the devil

She's cooking salad for breakfast
She's got tofu the size of Texas
She's a witness to her own glory
She's a neverending story

She's a frolicking depression
She's a self-inflicted obsession
She's got a thousand lonely husbands
She's playing footsie in another dimension

She's a goddess milking her time
For all that it's worth
