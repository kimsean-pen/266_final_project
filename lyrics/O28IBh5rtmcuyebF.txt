Now you on the run son,
Since 1981
You went and did some things,
And spoiled the fun
Yeah, you got the FBI,
They ain't on your side
Yeah you're caught foolin' friend,
With a senator's wife
Oh I don't need it,
Well no one does

Just sit on this groove and chew,
As the heat grew and grew;
A life of taking Love,
She fit like a glove
And in due time,
Yeah I'll be there

Well hello Harmony,
Whatcha doin' for free?
Yeah get on your knees you freak,
And please please me
A life of solitude,
Yeah, one with me, no you
Life on the run son,
It's all you knew
And I don't need it,
No, no one does
