Going so far into you
So far into you
So far into you

I'm going so far into you
You're going so far into me too
I don't know what other people do
I'm going so far into you

I'd do anything for you with the teeth died black
For her own reasons for my own reasons like that
Now
Think down your arm
Am i holding your hand
Rude like a straight line
I could've put you there.

I'm going so far into you
You're going so far into me too
I don't know what other people do
I'm going so far into you

I'm going so far into you
You have so much stuff to do
Now my dreams kind of came true
I'm going so far into you

Somehow you're now so worthy
You really should articulate
Lovers leap
Ask me anything if you're interesting
Said it like the beautiful parts of her head did
We can see the moon in the daytime

I'm going so far into you
You're going so far into me too
I don't know what other people do
I'm going so far into you
