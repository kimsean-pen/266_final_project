If you want to take to take a trip or two I don't know
Cause soon I'll keep you here with your coffin closed
Cause the ship's is turn to keep in
And it goes to me

Well you six feet under are you hear' the cries
For my long beat just i'm a wiggling bra
Atmosphere is overheating
Just won't bother me

I'm dead and gone
When you do me a roam
I'm dead and gone
Hey you do me a roam
I bet you love when you're done

Choking ourselves we don't want you to know
There's a warm place wait' for you just below
Atmosphere is overheating
Just won't bother me

In the middle of the night will you still hear the cries
Suffocation blues ain't bringing lullabies
If the steer we had equiping
Just wait and see

Dead and gone
When you do me a roam
I'm dead and gone
Jey you do me a roam
I bet you love when you're done

It's only now I can see
Words you don't have to speak
It's getting harder and harder to breathe
No more keep me down
Eat you up inside

I'm dead and gone
When you do me a roam
I'm dead and gone
Jey you do me a roam
I bet you love when you're done
