The sins of deliverance

The eyes of the patriot
Fixed through the scope
The unknowing tyrant
Walks to the rope
Its when murder is justice
That martyrs are made
A one-gun salute
For the new independence day
They'll hallow your name
They'll hallow your name for your Sacrifice

The sins of deliverance

"So let the wicked perish in the presence of God"
For your sacrifice
The sins of the father
Atoned by the son
Confessions of commitment broken
A nail driven for every one (of them)
Its when murder is justice
That martyrs are made
A one-gun salute
For the new independence day
They'll hallow your name
They'll hallow your name for your Sacrifice

You are the cause
I am the effect
Created in hatred,
A noose for your neck
The eyes of the patriot
Fixed through the scope
The unknowing tyrant
Walks to the rope
They'll hallow your name
For your sacrifice
They'll hallow your name
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
They'll hallow your name
