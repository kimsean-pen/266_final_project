This place is a tale of terror
This place is a ghost town now
This place has lost its people
This place has lost its charm

The coals on the fire ain't burnin' no more
In the lake shore foundries
The workers misled by corporations
That knows no boundaries

This place is a tale of terror
This place is a ghost town now
This place has lost its people
This place has lost its charm

The land of liberty has been betrayed by
The monster corporations
The monster won't stop 'til
It lays waste to everything

This place is a tale of terror
This place is a ghost town now
This place has lost its people
This place has lost its charm
This place
This place
This place
This place
