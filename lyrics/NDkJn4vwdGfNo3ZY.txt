I hit the ground, yeah I came in running
Was coming up when all the rain was pouring down
You'd never know that I was always spinning
I turn the corner and I pass right through the crowd

Me, I would never know
See, I can never wait
Me, I can never stop my world from spinning
See, I can never grow
Me, I can never be
See, I can never go, the walls keep falling

Say here I stand
I was broken, now I'm brave
Say here I am
Found my colours in the grey

My legs are tired, but I keep on pushing
I drop my hands and let my head fall heavy down
It's like I found my only child gone missing
I raise my arms up to the sky and show my crown

Me, I would never know
See I can never wait
Me, I can never stop my world from spinning

Say here I stand
I was broken, now I'm brave
Say here I am
Found my colours in the grey

Me, I would never know
See, I can never wait
Me, I can never stop my world from spinning

Say here I am
And we'll stand until I'm gone

Woe to the end of the road
Everyone who's far away from home
And it's all that I know
Growing up and growing old

Me, I would never know
See I can never wait
Me, I can never stop my world from spinning

Say here I stand
I was broken, now I'm brave

Me, I would never know
See I can never wait
Me, I can never stop my world from spinning

Say here I am
And we'll stand until I'm gone
