Girl
I tried to run but couldn't get too far
My heart is pumpin' but still I'm runnin' in place
No matter how hard I try to get your touch
When you're away too long, oh girl it's too much

But everytime I run I need you oh so bad
But I'm running scared, my heart is beatin' so fast
I heard that you could make a man change his plan
that's why I'm running fast, I'm running the 100 yard dash

I ran for the hills and girl there you were
How you appear, you see I never know
I told the bartender to pour me a double glass
Then light me a smoke so I can sing some jazz

Now here come them legs, here come those eyes
And neither one I can never deny
I try to be smooth as I can
But I guess I need another plan

I need you lovin' baby, oh so bad
Girl I'm runnin' scared, my heart's beatin' so fast
I heard that you could make a man change his plan
That's why I'm running fast, I'm runnin' the 100 yard dash

You know I'm running (oh so bad)
Girl you know you got my heart (beatin' so fast)
I heard that you could make a man (change his plan)
I guess that's why I'm running baby (the 100 yard dash)

Your love gets stronger
And it feels like everyday is getting longer
I feel your love like a monkey on my back
Girl your heart is so big see I can feel the attack

Oh, Oh I need some lovin'
I, I want your lovin'
I can have your lovin'
I need to, got to, got to have your lovin'
