"Some men... just wanna watch the world burn."

Suicide obsession in a world of betray,
Taunted into silence and then bury the rage,
Deep depression darkness fed, pull the trigger count the dead.
Contradict of faith, out to devastate,
Crazed disposition underlining deceit,
Killing without reason for no cause or belief,
Deadly imposition, out of touch and deranged,
One with god half insane
Wage of sanctity, tears and agony,
Ancient and bizarre Satan's repertoire.

In the minds of evil, fear imposed by design,
In the minds of evil, kill till everything dies!

Twisted by religion and fanatical hate,
In the line of fire devastation in place,
Homicidal mission of tyrannical lust,
Fatal inquisition for the spilling of blood,
Don't care what you've done, death to everyone,
It's no mystery, destroy you and me.

In the minds of evil, fear imposed by his design,
In the minds of evil, death to all of mankind... die
In the minds of evil, burn in hell and die... and die!

In the minds of evil, fear imposed by design,
In the minds of evil, death to all of mankind.
