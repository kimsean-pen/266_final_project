Well hello, it's me again
I'm at your door come let me in
And you can whisper in my ear
Words of precious and some dear

Snow falls on me every night
With you ...on me I revive
You will never spend another night
Alone

Feel the heart and ...keep
You shake the leaves off every tree
That I've be heading from your head
The grass that grows beneath your bed

Snow falls on me every night
With you ...on me I revive
You will never spend another night
Alone

The ivy covered house
I'm only spinning out
The ivy covered house
That's where you live now
The ivy covered house
Away from the ...
The ivy covered house
I've always been without
The ivy covered house
We're I'm spinning now
The ivy covered house.
