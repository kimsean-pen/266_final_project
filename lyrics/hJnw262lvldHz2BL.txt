Too bad for you
I'm a walking open wound
Too close, too soon
Another sad excuse
Go on and take my mind
No matter what you find
I'll keep you under my skin
I'll never let this go
Before I lose it all
Tell me now could you

Could you love what tries to kill you?
Will you trust what isn't true?
Can I find my own forgiveness?
Can I get to you?
So find yourself
After today will be all you remember
Before anyone else
Take all their words and rewrite them your own way

That's it for me
My last apology
I held us like glass
That broke inside my hands
We walk a fragile line
No matter what you find
Just keep me under your skin
And what I need to know
Before you let me go
Tell me how could you

Could you love what tries to kill you?
Will you trust what isn't true?
Can I find my own forgiveness?
Can I get to you?
So find yourself
After today will be all you remember
Before anyone else
Take all their words and rewrite them your own way

I know you'll never understand
That all my scars and stories, are who I am
Tell me does it feel like home?
Hanging at the end of your rope
You can tear it down or go your own way

Could you love what tries to kill you?
Could you love what tries...

Could you love what tries to kill you?
Will you trust what isn't true?
Can I find my own forgiveness?
Can I get to you?
So find yourself
After today will be all you remember
Before anyone else
Take all their words and rewrite them your own way
Take all their words and rewrite them your own way
