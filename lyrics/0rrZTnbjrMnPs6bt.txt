All I see is zombies
Moving all around us
You can hear them coming
(they can take your life)
You can hear them breathing, breathing down your spine

That's right, that's right

All I see is zombies
Moving, screaming, loudly
They can smell your body
And they want your soul

Here they come behind you
Try and stay alive
Do you feel alive?
You will find that there is no safe place to hide

That's right, that's right

All I see is zombies
Hear them all around us
If you feel them coming
Then you won't survive

They don't know what I am
They just stay alive
Do you feel alive?
You will find that there is no safe place to hide

Do you feel alive?
Do you feel alive?
Do you feel alive?
