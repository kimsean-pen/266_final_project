my eyes blew out I could finally see
warm magical tropical oceans
organs of people circle the sea
I fell back to perpetual motion

I opened my skull you were looking at me
oh you and your cousins chihuahua
we all howled a chord and extended the three
freddy was there and re-mixed it after

my eyes blew out I could finally see
warm magical tropical oceans
organs of people circle the sea
I fell back to perpetual motion
