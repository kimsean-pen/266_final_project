Hut one, hut two, hut three, go

I'm so icy like ice cream
All you ladies take a scoop and try to bite me
Girl, I'll wear you out like some Nikes
Haters stepping up either beat feet or try me
Nibble on your ear like my name is Mike Tysie
Get you in the ring, world champ, all feisty
Girl, hurry up, I'm a shot clock running out of time
Ain't no 3 pump chump, shooting 3's on this baseline

Go on, girl, let me touch that body
You know I like when you drop it low
Hike up that skirt, get naughty
Hut one, hut two, hut three, go
Go on, girl, let me touch that body
You know I like when you lose control
Hike up that skirt, get naughty
Hut one, hut two, hut three, go
Hut one, hut two, hut three, go
Hut one, hut two, hut three, go

Roll up to the club with a knapsack full of Norcos
Looking fly, I'm like Zack Morris with cornrows
Girls look at me like "that guy must make pornos"
Yeah, I'm pushing 30, but I still drink Mickey four-0's
Shades on at night, I'm feeling sleezy
Cut into the line like "where the VIP be?
Yeah, I'm the guy who talks about his weenie
Check the list again, yeah, they call me Charlie P. Scene

Go on, girl, let me touch that body
You know I like when you drop it low
Hike up that skirt, get naughty
Hut one, hut two, hut three, go
Go on, girl, let me touch that body
You know I like when you lose control
Hike up that skirt, get naughty
Hut one, hut two, hut three, go

'Cause I'm the kind of guy that you'd love to be
There ain't nobody that could fuck with me
And all them ladies want me to beat them cheeks
And all you fucking haters go beat your meat
'Cause I'm the kind of guy that you'd love to be
There ain't nobody that could fuck with me
And all them ladies want me to beat them cheeks
And all you fucking haters go beat your meat

Go on, girl, let me touch that body
You know I like when you drop it low
Hike up that skirt, get naughty
Hut one, hut two, hut three, go
Go on, girl, let me touch that body
You know I like when you lose control
Hike up that skirt, get naughty
Hut one, hut two, hut three, go
Hut one, hut two, hut three, go
Hut one, hut two, hut three, go
