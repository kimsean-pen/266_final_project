You say
You're not gonna fight
'Cause no one will fight for you
And
You think
There's not enough love
And no one to give it to

And
You're sure
You've hurt for so long
You've got nothing left to lose
So
You say
You're not gonna fight
'Cause no one will fight for you

You say
The weight of the world
Has kept you from letting go
And
You think
Compassion's a flaw
And you'll never let it show

And
You're sure
You've hurt in a way
That no one will ever know
But
Some day
The weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go

Hold on
The weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go
So
Hold on
The weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go

So
Hold on
The weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go
Just
Hold on
The weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go
