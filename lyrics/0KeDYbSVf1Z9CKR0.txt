Yeah, I say it to your face, but it doesn't mean a thing, no!
Show me, show me how to do it
You say I do it all wrong
But you don't even talk to me
But you don't even talk to me
And every time I have to prove it
I'm working all day long
For the love I never see
Yeah, I say it to your face, but it doesn't mean a thing, no!
Up all night and all day long
Cut me up, but it feels so strong
It's cutting me
You're cutting me
Oh baby, baby, hold me up and put me on
What you do doesn't matter much
Cause you're stressing me
Yeah I say it to your face, but it doesn't mean a thing, no!
I don't know who you think you're fooling
You'll cower, you come up
Do what I do all for free
Yes I do, yes I do
I wonder how you got your shoes on
You say you're 'bout that tall
If I'll ever see
Yeah I say it, say it, say it, but it doesn't mean a thing, no
Cutting me
Cutting me
Up all night and all day long
Cut me up and feels so strong
It's cutting me
You're cutting me
Oh, hold me up and put me on
What you do doesn't matter much
It's cutting me
You're cutting me
Yeah I say it to your face, but it doesn't mean a thing, no!
