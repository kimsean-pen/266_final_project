This anxiety
Drills a hole within my soul
How did I get here?
In the ruins of my own
Oh, I guess I'll never know

Stabbing agony
Cutting words off from my throat
I've been falling so deep
In the bottom of my soul?

I've been drowning here
In the waters of my pain
How could I crawl so low
To the bottom of my soul

Evil scenery
Quiet needles thrust my eyes
And there's nothing I can do
Deep inside it hurts
The blood is bitter in my mouth
While I'm sinking down in the mud

Stabbing agony
Cutting words off from my throat
I've been falling so deep
In the bottom of my soul?

I've been drowning here
In the waters of my pain
How could I crawl so low
To the bottom of my soul

I'm down in the mud
At the bottom of my soul

Stabbing agony
Cutting words off from my throat
I've been falling so deep
In the bottom of my soul?

I've been drowning here
In the ocean of my hurt
Where have I lost my wings
To the bottom of my soul

This anxiety
In the ruins of my own...
