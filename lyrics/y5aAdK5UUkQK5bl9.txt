(I'm bored
I don't want to go to school
Don't want to be nobody's fool
I want to be me
I want to be me
I don't want to be sweet and neat
I don't want someone living my life for me
I want to be free
I'm going to turn this world inside out
Going to turn suburbia upside down
Going to walk the streets, scream and shout
Going to crawl through the alleyways, being very loud

Don't want to be told what to wear
As long as you're warm who cares
I want to be me
I want to be me
So what if I dye my hair?
I've still got a brain up there
And I'm going to be me
I'm going to be free
I'm going to turn this world inside out
Going to turn suburbia upside down
Going to walk the streets, scream and shout
Going to crawl through the alleyways, being very loud
I'm going to turn this world inside out
Going to turn suburbia upside down

Tear down the wallpaper
Turf out the cat
Tear up the carpet
And get rid of that
Blow up the TV
Blow up the car
Without these things
You don't know where you are
Sell all the magazines
Pull down the abattoirs
And all that's obscene
Everything in life
Should be totally free
We should live and let live
And all live our dreams
I'm going to turn this world inside out
I'm going to turn suburbia upside down
I'm going to pull my hair, scream and shout
I'm going to crawl through the alleyways, being very loud
I'm going to turn this world inside out
I'm going to turn suburbia upside down
I'm going to pull my hair, scream and shout
I'm going to crawl through the alleyways, being very loud
I'm gonna be free
I'm gonna be free
I'm gonna be free
I'm gonna be free
I'm gonna be free
