Touch yourself and get yourself
Come alive, just driving it around
I love you more than anyone
Stop asking me where I come from

Summer night, take off your clothes
The water's warm, our bodies glowing
Light you up and stretch it out
Now I know I could never live without

Stop asking me where I come from
Tell me how to love someone
Stop asking me where I come from
I love you more than anyone

Don't listen to a thing they say
They don't need you in the same way
Don't ever let them change you
They don't know you like I do
No, you don't need their love
No, you don't need their love

Touch yourself, get yourself
Let yourself come alive
Put me out, pull me in
Get me off and let's in

Stop asking me where I come from
Tell me how to love someone
Stop asking me where I come from
I love you more than anyone
