Glamorous indie rock & roll is what I want
It's in my soul, it's what I need
Indie rock & roll, it's time

Two of us, flippin' through a thrift store magazine
She plays the drums, I'm on tambourine
Bet your, your bottom dollar on me

It's indie rock & roll for me
It's indie rock & roll for me
It's all I need
It's indie rock & roll for me

In a clutch, I'm talkin' every word for all the boys
Electric girls with worn down toys
Make it up, break it up, what do you care?
Oh, what do you care?

I take my twist with a shout
A coffee shop with a cause, then I'll freak you out
No sex, no drugs, no life, no love
When it comes to today

Stay if you wanna love me, stay
Oh, don't be shy, let's cause a scene
Like lovers do on silver screens
Let's make it, yeah, we'll cause a scene

It's indie rock & roll for me
It's indie rock & roll for me
It's all I need
It's indie rock & roll for me

In a clutch, I'm talking every word for all the boys
(Indie rock & roll for me)
(It's all I need)
Makin' up, breakin' up, what do you care?
(It's indie rock & roll for me)
