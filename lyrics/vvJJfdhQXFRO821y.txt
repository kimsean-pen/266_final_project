Don't bother, I'm a danger to my health
Don't bother, well I'm a danger to
Don't bother, well I'm a danger
Don't bother, I'm a danger to your health

So I'm baking a cake
Got this badass oven filled with goodies and treats
For all of my friends
Then Jonny comes and he poisons the food
Everyone is dead, now wasn't that rude

But now
But now, but as the words are meaningless
So now, because I am
But now (and we crack all our backs to relax and recap)
But as the words are meaningless (the one time I looked like the goddamn circus)
So now (and we crack all our backs to relax and recap)
Because I am (the one time Iooked like the goddamn circus)

Nobody will ever take
The things in my fucked up brain
Well, no one can ever take
The horrors in my life
Take my life
Because these words, they'll never speak
Take my life
Falling apart for you
Take my life
Take my eyes, they'll never speak
Take one love
Help me into you
Come away, go away

Don't bother, well I'm a danger
Don't bother, well I'm a danger

But now, but as the words are meaningless
So now, because I am
But now (and we crack all our backs to relax and recap)
But as the words are meaningless (And we break into bits to believe we're legit)
So now (and we crack all our backs to relax and recap)
Because I am (the one time I looked like the goddamn circus)

Help me to grow and soar, stand up
Help me to win, drop the words that come from my mouth
Go and find the words
You're speaking in tongues
Go, drop the words that help me they come from my mouth

So blow away (Gotta sense that this is overdone)
Oooh (But at least I'm having fun)

(Gotta sense that this is overdone)
So blow (But at least I'm having fun)
Oooh (I have gotta sense that this is overdone)
(But at least I'm having fun)

Oooh (Gotta sense that this is overdone)
Oooh (But at least I'm having fun)
Oooh (I have gotta sense that this is overdone)
Oooh (But at least I'm having fun)

(Gotta sense that this is overdone)
So blow (But at least I'm having fun)
Away (I have gotta sense that this is overdone)
Oooh (But at least I'm having fun)

(Gotta sense that this is overdone)
So blow (But at least I'm having fun)
Oooh (I have gotta sense that this is overdone)
Oooh (But at least I'm having fun)

(Gotta sense that this is overdone)
Oooh (But at least I'm having fun)
Oooh (I have gotta sense that this is overdone)
Oooh (But at least I'm having fun)
