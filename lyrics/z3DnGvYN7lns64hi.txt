Grown pieces of slandered youth
Told to wonder but never worry about the truth
The earth feels so raw in these little hands
Could it be that they're the ones who understand

So take a big leap forward
And take that old step back
Cause we are on the edge of something
Something bigger than we expect

I am not alone in this tower
Keeping us in good time
Maybe if only for an hour
Just to keep us satisfied
And it feels like I'm the only one

The moon moves in the only direction
The only one we know
As it runs against us
It fills the void in us all

So lift your arms up for the mistaken
Throw in the way of the call
Carry fruit into the garden
Bring the seed into us all
And it feels like I'm the only one

I am not alone in this tower
Keeping us in good time
Maybe if only for an hour
Just to keep us satisfied
And it feels like I'm the only one
