The way you always made me look at you,
With all the simple things you said,
The way so many things surrounded you,
And all the tears it seemed to make.

And now i'm fallin there's nothing left to say,
And i can't break free not from in me there.

I can't breathe without you, I can't breathe with out you,
I can't breathe without you, Without you, Without you, Without you.

The way i thought i'd never leave this place,
The way you made it seem so real,
Coz you had faith and you had empathy,
And all i needed was this.

And now i'm falling, I've got nothing left too say,
And i can't break free, Not from in me there.

Coz i can't breathe without you, I can't breathe without you,
I can't breathe without you, Without you, Without you, Without you,

How can I let you leave this way,
Without you i'm not at all,
And i see things now all those memories,
Just too see you again.
