There was a girl I knew
She saw the prison inside
She cursed her keeper
And swore she'd get free

Every time I see
I got my hands wrapped around the bars
I want out right now

She led an angel's life
On angel's wings
Jumped out her apartment window
And hit the street below

Every time I see
I got my hands wrapped around the bars
I can't shut off my mind
And now I've waited, my hands are wrapped around the bars
I'm burning, my soul is pushed against the bars
The bars, the lies, the lies, lies, lies
Are trapped behind the bars

My mind hates my body
My body hates my soul
I close my eyes and fight
Inside my own black hole

Every time I see
I got my hands wrapped around the bars
I want out right now!

I've lived my life
I'm doing my time
I realize life's lie

Every time I see
I got my hands wrapped around the bars
I can't shut off my mind
And now I'm waiting, my hands are wrapped around the bars
I'm burning, my soul is pushed against the bars
The bars, the lies, the lies, lies, lies
They're trapped behind my eyes
