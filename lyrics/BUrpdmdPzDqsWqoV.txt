Remembrance
Sanity's surreal
Boundaries blurred
The turning wheel
Perspectives
Of equal might
Engage in battle
None is right

Centuries... of hatred
Return... from chaos

Feel the force
Destroy the will
Mankind tastes
This bitter pill
Now converging
Freedom cried
Unconnected
Millions died

Lifetime... of darkness
Return... from chaos

Not fallen prey
Nothing will overcome
With the banner held high
Let the chaos overrun
