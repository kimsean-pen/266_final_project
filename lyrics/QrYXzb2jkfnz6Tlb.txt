I know it's harder each time
You haven't got to tell me
It's always on my mind
You used to find it so easy
Do you remember when
We wrote our names up on the wall
And we hoped it would stay there forever

I wasn't ready for that call
But I'm glad that you made it
I didn't realize at all
It killed me to hear it

Haven't I told you enough
You're where I'm meant to be
'Cause you're mine and I will always say that
Haven't I told you enough that you are everything
'Cause you're mine and I will always say that
I will always say that

Your eyes look different this time
God knows that I hate it
Do you see the change in mine
Now I know how much I'm missing
I remember when
We danced around the living room
And I hope we do that forever

I wasn't ready for that call
But I'm glad that you made it
I didn't realize at all
It killed me to hear it

Haven't I told you enough
You're where I'm meant to be
'Cause your mine and I will always say that
Haven't I told you enough that you are everything
'Cause you're mine and I will always say that
I will always say that

Will you read what I wrote about you
Nothing could change you and me
How could I forget your voice
It's always on repeat
It's not like I had a choice
It's become a part of me

Haven't I told you enough
You're where I'm meant to be
'Cause your mine and I will always say that
Haven't I told you enough that you are everything
'Cause you're mine and I will always say that
I will always say that
