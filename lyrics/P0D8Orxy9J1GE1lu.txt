If you changed would I stay
Don't have an easy answer
A tooth ache I can't shake
Your misery is comfort
Either way I'm to blame
You won't change
I can't stay

And where'd you go
The one I used to know
Time is running out
My soul is empty
And where'd you go
We died so slow
I lost you and it's eating me alive

I take back the notes
The melody's cold
My spirit is choked
This isn't my home
When I can breathe
I smell the disease
An ocean created to keep me
Stuck in between

And where'd you go
The one I used to know
Time is running out
My soul is empty
And where'd you go
We died so slow
I lost you and it's eating me alive

And where'd you go
The one I used to know
Time is running out
My soul is empty

And where'd you go
The one I used to know
Time is running out
My soul is empty
And where'd you go
We died so slow
I lost you and it's eating me alive

And where'd you go (and where'd you go)
We died so slow
I lost you and it's eating me alive
