I've gotta listen to my radio,
Checkin out the airwaves for something to believe in,
Gimme something to hold true, gimme something to sing about.
Gimme a reason to care, I'll sing along forever.

Watered-down words covered in song trying to hide the truth
That life is beautiful, and life is pain give it to me straight

Touch my heart,
I'll sing along forever.
I'll sing along forever.
I'll sing along forever.

I've gotta listen to my radio,
Checkin out the airwaves for something to believe in.
Gimme something to hold true, gimme something to sing about.
Gimme a reason to care, I'll sing along forever.

Give it to me straight,
Touch my heart,
I'll sing along forever.
