Looking at a lonely window
Everybody's down below
Feeling kinda anti-social
Feeling like I've got to be alone

You'll never see me do the tango
Maybe after hell has froze
Really, simply, not a dancer
You'll never see me biting on a rose

I have chose to stand still in front of a dancing band
Something that you ought to, got to, know
You'll never see me biting on a rose
