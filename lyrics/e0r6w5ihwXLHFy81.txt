Home!

Hmm, oh, the future is gonna be bright
A clear path and all the stars are out
Looking up at the dark blue sky
Walking steady, not blinded by the light

I don't believe in a god, let's leave religion out of all this
I don't remember promising my life and soul to bring you all bliss
If I am what you say, I expect to be hanging from a wooden cross
When all this is done, it's done
I don't believe in a god, let's leave religion out of all this
I don't remember promising my life and soul to bring you all bliss
If I am what you say, I expect to be hanging from a wooden cross
When all this is done, it's done

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Home
Home

Oh, oh, the past will never be the same
Once I am done, good memories will be gone
They guard their secrets with their life
I spit on your fo-forsaken tribe

I don't believe in a god, let's leave religion out of all this
I don't remember promising my life and soul to bring you all bliss
If I am what you say, I expect to be hanging from a wooden cross
When all this is done, it's done
I don't believe in a god, let's leave religion out of all this
I don't remember promising my life and soul to bring you all bliss
If I am what you say, I expect to be hanging from a wooden cross
When all this is done, it's done

Oh, thy beauty makes me go blind
When you are near, my senses don't function
I give you this empty life
Can I be your solider with a knife?

I don't believe in a god, let's leave religion out of all this

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
