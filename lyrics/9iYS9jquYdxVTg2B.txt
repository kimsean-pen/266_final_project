you died at 69
with a body full of cancer

I asked your God how could you
but never heard an answer

no one saw it coming
the diagnosis of stage four

the bravest woman I know
who survived it once before.

last week i crashed my car
and i walked away unscathed

maybe that was you
asking me to keep my faith

you cried at the thought
of never seeing me again

if there was an afterlife
i want you to go to heaven

I've never felt so selfish
it's not what i prefere

i've always kept it honest
especially for her

She gave me her best,
she swore I was her heart
I couldn't worship the god
that let her fall apart I'm not sure what I believe Well I think that's understood But I know she's looking out for me The way she said she would The way she said she would The way she said she would
