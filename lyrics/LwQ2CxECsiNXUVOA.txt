I'm a stranger
A creature apart
Heart so tender
Tame it
You will remember
One more bite to be less alone
And what you made up
Tame it tame it
Want me, hate me, talk about me
I don't feel alone
Want me, hate me, talk about me
I will feel alone
We are one of hypnotized faces
Because we don't know we deserve more than it
You will swallow the rigor in one bite
But no longer myself
I'm a stranger
The white out to be less alone
Heart so tender
Tame it, tame it
Want me, hate me, talk about me
I don't feel alone
Want me, hate me, talk about me
I will feel alone It won't be for good It won't be for good
