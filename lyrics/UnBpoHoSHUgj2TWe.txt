Don't look now, we're branded, we're the black sheep
Sown (?) apart messiah (desire?) makes the black sheep
When the water seems too deep the shadows are waves, way (wait?) beneath
But laughing loud we brave the row (role?), the black sheep

If you see me you'll be crossing the street
Or kick me and then leave me to bleed
If looks could kill wouldn't need all the pills but
I take what it needs to be easy
With the black sheep now
We're the black sheep now

Don't look now we're stranded here as black sheep
Swallowed whole and out of reach, the black sheep
Unsafe but numb by now
Were shepherded from higher ground
But drowned all out(?) we saved the row (role?), the black sheep

If you see me you'll be crossing the street
Or kick me and then leave me to bleed
If looks could kill wouldn't need all the pills but
I take what it needs to be easy
With the black sheep now
We're the black sheep now

If you see me you'll be crossing the street
Or kick me and then leave me to bleed
If looks could kill wouldn't need all the pills but
I take what it needs to be easy

If you see me you'll be crossing the street (if you see me you'll be crossing the street)
Or kick me and then leave me to bleed (or kick me and then leave me to bleed)
If looks could kill wouldn't need all the pills but
I take what it needs to be easy (I take what it needs to be easy)

If you see me you'll be crossing the street (if you see me you'll be crossing the street)
Or kick me and then leave me to bleed (or kick me and then leave me to bleed)
If looks could kill wouldn't need all the pills but
I take what it needs to be easy
With the black sheep now
We're the black sheep now
We're the black sheep now
We're the black sheep now
We're the black sheep now

Loretta young silks

Got answers for everyone, endless excuses
Not happy for anyone, cos I'm trying to break your click-track heart
Seen a vision of perfect grace, airbrushed and lifeless
All contempt and aftertaste it's like I'm waiting for the scars to heal

All style before content, using me as bait
You sell loretta young silks, swapping your love for hate

Soft focus for full appeal, pictured as flawless
No contest for self esteem, was that be pushed to give your love on that
As far as the eye can see: too much perfection
