There's no stronger wind than the one that blows down a lonesome railroad line
No prettier sight than lookin' back on a town you left behind
There is nothin' that's as real as a love that's in my mind

Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
Close your eyes
I'll be here for a while

Well there's lots of things along the road I'd surely like to see
I'd like to lean into the wind and tell myself I'm free
But your softest whisper's louder than the highways call to me

Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
Close your eyes
I'll be here for a while

All the mountains and the rivers and the valleys can't compare
To your blue lit dancin', flashin' eyes and yellow shining hair
I could never hit the open road and leave you layin' there

Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
Close your eyes
I'll be here for a while

Lay your head back easy, love, close your cryin' eyes
I'll be layin' here beside you when the sun comes on the rise
I'll stay as long as the cuckoo wails and the lonesome bluejay flies.

Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
Close your eyes
I'll be here for a while

Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
Close your eyes
I'll be here for a while
