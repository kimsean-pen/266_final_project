Rose tinted view
And satellites that
Compromise the truth

But I wanted more
With the cuts and the bruises
Touch my face
A hopeless embrace

Faith
It drives me away
But it turns me on
Like a stranger's love

It rockets through the universe
It fuels the lies and feeds the curse
Believe we could be
Glorious
I need to believe

But I still want more
With the cuts and the bruises
Don't close the door
On what you adore

And faith
It drives me away
But it turns me on
Like a stranger's love
It rockets through the universe
It fuels the lies and feeds the curse
Believe we could be
Glorious
