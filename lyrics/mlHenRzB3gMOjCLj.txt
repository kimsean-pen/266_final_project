You say I should come around, come around
You say that we're ballin' now, you say you don't
You just tryina come around, come around
You just tryina come around, come around
You say that we smoke a lot, smoke a lot
I ain't start some drama, no
But I know, and you know that you love the sound
We run the town
Now you're tryina come around, so come around
You say that we're bout the life, bout the life
Am I fucked with model types? And dirty spice?
If you say just another night, we run?
People tell me I'm indifferent, I love the life
You say that you come around
And I must try to fuck you all along
And I just tryina get you
Tryina get that booty up on the roof
And I know that you come around your way
I decided walk around the other day
You just tryina come around, come around
You just tryina come around, come around
