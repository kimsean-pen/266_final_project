Here I am and I'm not scared
To lock eyes with you
You better to prepare 'cause I'm gonna stare
And burn a hole right through
Yes I know how to take control
Don't let it phase ya
I'm like a laser
Ready to read your soul
Blow
Blow me
Blow me a kiss
Blow me a kiss of death
Let me die for you
Make my lips turn blue
And be the love you never knew
Come on, blow me a kiss of death
Oh oh
Go on and act like you would never touch me
With a 10-foot pole
But I'm here to win, I'll suck you right in
Just like a big black hole

You got a flare for an air of uncertainty
Tell me your secret
Go on and leak it
You're gonna blow my scene
Blow
Blow me
Blow me a kiss
Blow me a kiss of death
Let me die for you
Make my lips turn blue
And be the love you never knew
Come on, blow me a kiss of death
Do it!
