Boy when I first saw you
I knew I could adore u
And it's my nature to be shy but not tonight, no
So let me make the first move
I'll make it easy for you
Someone has to break the ice, oh baby, oh

Don't care bout your money or the car that you drive
'Cause my affection ain't somethin' you can buy
Got my suspicion lookin' in your eye
That you could be my kind of guy

Do you like watchin' the sun come up
Sippin champagne in a paper cup
Laughin' when you're makin love
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
Dancin' to a sad love song
Even when the music's gone
Kisses that go on and on and on
'Cause I'm that kind of girl

Is this first star wishing
A woman's intuition
Has my arrow found its mark, oh baby, yeah-hey
'Cause all I do is think of you
In a fantasy for two
And I've just got to let you know
'Cause being real is in my heart and soul

Don't care bout your money or the car that you drive
'Cause my affection ain't somethin' you can buy
Got my suspicion lookin' in your eye
That you could be my kind of guy

Do you like watchin' the sun come up (up)
Sippin champagne in a paper cup (oh yeah)
Laughin' when you're makin love (oh whoa)
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
Dancin' to a sad love song (yeah yeah yeah)
Even when the music's gone (music's gone)
Kisses that go on and on and on (on and on and on and on)
'Cause I'm that kind of girl

I wanna be kissin' in the rain
Fallin' in love over and over again
Oh, 'cause I'm that kind of girl

Do you like watchin' the sun come up
Sippin champagne in a paper cup
Laughin' when you're makin love
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
Dancin' to a sad love song (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Even when the music's gone (music's gone)
Kisses that go on and on and on (on and on and on and oh
Whoa)
'Cause I'm that kind of girl

Do you like watchin' the sun come up
(Don't care 'bout your money or the car that you drive)
Sippin champagne in a paper cup
('Cause my affection ain't somethin' you can buy)
Laughin' when you're makin love
(Got my suspicion lookin' in your eye)
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
Dancin' to a sad love song (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Even when the music's gone (music's gone)
Kisses that go on and on and on
(On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on)
'Cause I'm that kind of girl

Do you like watchin' the sun come up
(Don't care 'bout your money or the car that you drive)
Sippin champagne in a paper cup
('Cause my affection ain't somethin' you can buy)
Laughin' when you're makin love
(Got my suspicion lookin' in your eye)
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
Dancin' to a sad love song
Even when the music's gone
Kisses that go on and on and on
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
