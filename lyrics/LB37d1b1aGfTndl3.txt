Dumb fuck kid celebrities
Talking heads and T.V. screens
Tell me what to do, I'm freaking out
Doctor, cure my new disease
Fill up my prescription please
Take a knee the emperor's a clown

Oh my god I think they poisoned the water
Just need a place to raise my daughter

Let's buy a private island
Get high and keep on driving
Let's try some time and patience
I'm gonna take you on a blue vacation
Vacation

Closet-cased and paranoid
Slingshot armies fill the void
Watch the news or lay out in the sun
Teach me how to twist and shout
Stay at home or face the crowd
I tried doing both but let's just run

Oh my god I think I'm gonna go crazy
They're picking sides but I'm just too lazy

Let's buy a private island
Get high and keep on driving
Let's try some time and patience
I'm gonna take you on a blue vacation
Vacation

Is it me or is this room spinning?
I can't seem to turn it off
Is it me or is this room spinning?
Someone tell me when it stops
I guess what you give
Is what you've got

Let's buy a private island
Get high and keep on driving
Let's try some time and patience
I'm gonna take you on a blue vacation
Vacation
