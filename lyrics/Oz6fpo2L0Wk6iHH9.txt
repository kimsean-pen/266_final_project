Where my heart lies
Have you tried to bring back a lift at false?
Or tried to hold up the sun at dawn?
What are you trying to do?
You should know how I feel about you

If you are my light, like the sun up in the sky, I'll be there
Where my heart lies
If you are my light, like a candle in the night, I'll be there
Where my heart lies

If you are my light, like the sun up in the sky, I'll be there
Where my heart lies
If you are my light, like a candle in the night, I'll be there
(Where my heart lies)
(Where my heart lies)
(Where my heart lies)

I never really know what's on your mind
So maybe I should just turn around
What are you trying to do?
Don't you know how I feel about you?

If you are my light, like the sun up in the sky, I'll be there
Where my heart lies
If you are my light, like a candle in the night, I'll be there
Where my heart lies
