There's somewhere north of Florida
A little west of Georgia
At my best, you're not impressed
'Cause I'm a loser
Both my wings are frozen, cold like Minnesota
Pinned between the Boulders with the rest

But I try, I try not to need you
Like you need me
And I try, and I try not to need you
Like you need me

I'm sick and tired of living in LA
Where the sun is out but there's so much shade
I need a place to go with the seasons
Where no one has a reason to be coldhearted
To be coldhearted

You like hills and yoga
I like hanging over
You're more like Kim and I'm too nice to be Kanye
Stand up like a solider
But I'm a rock and roller
I take my rage and throw the flames into the water

But I try, I try not to need you
Like you need me
And I try, and I try not to need you
Like you need me

I'm sick and tired of living in LA
Where the sun is out but there's so much shade
I need a place to go with the seasons
Where no one has a reason to be coldhearted
To be coldhearted

I'm way too cold to hold ya
Call me when it's over
I realized I'm just as frozen as the rest

I'm sick and tired of living in LA
Where the sun is out but there's so much shade
I need a place to go with the seasons
Where no one has a reason to be coldhearted
To be coldhearted
