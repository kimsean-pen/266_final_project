I, I can't read the future
But I still want to hold you close
Right now, I need that from you
So give, me the morning
Sharing another day with you
Is all I want to know

And baby I, I've tried to forget you
But the light of your eyes, still
Shines, you shine like an angel
A spirit that won't let me go

I, I didn't want to tell you
Things I didn't wanna know, myself
Was afraid to show
But you, you gave me a reason
A reason to face the truth
Oh, yes you did
To face the truth, face the truth, face the truth

And baby I, I've tried to forget you
But the light of your eyes, still
Shines, shines, shines like an angel
A spirit that won't let me go
Won't let me - go

Let go - of my heart

And baby I, I've tried to forget you
But the light of your eyes, still
Shines, like an angel
A spirit that won't let me go

No, won't let me go
