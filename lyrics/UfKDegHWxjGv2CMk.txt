Guess that you'll be leaving now.
Even in your deepest doubt,
have you got it all...
figured out?

The smell of you is on me still.
The night died way too young.
This feeling is alive and well
Even in your deepest dread,
have you got a fault...
line in your head?

I was waiting for someone,
to turn my world around.
You came in the summer,
and time was winding down.

Wonder what you're thinking now.
Even in your deepest doubt,
have you got it all...
figured out?

I was waiting for someone,
to turn my world around.
You came in the summer,
and time was winding down

I was waiting for someone,
to turn my world around.
You came in the summer,
and time was winding down

Why do you, why do you, why do you lie?
Not coming, not coming back.
How could you, how could you, how could you lie?
You're not coming, not coming back.
How could you, how could you, how could you lie?
You're not coming, not coming back.

I was waiting for someone,
to turn my world around.
You came in the summer,
and time was winding down

I was waiting for someone,
to turn my world around.
You came in the summer,
and time was winding down.
