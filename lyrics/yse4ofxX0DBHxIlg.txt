nineteen ninety eight looked great on
plain white paper on the fiftieth plane to champaign
but to tell you the truth
if i had a chance to kill it
i'd pick it up and take it and shake it and

the kid's in our heads
we've got a lot of people to fear this year

oh addy do i love you
but god such things i have to do
addy do i want to hear you
but i just can't get through
addy do i miss you
these dreams i sing when i
kiss you

oh addy do i love you
but got such things i have to do
addy do i want to hear you
but i just can't get through
addy do i want to hold you
but anyone may do
addy do i miss you
these dreams i sing when i'm
