Coming up to see, to see you acting fine
'Cause I've been asleep and I lost my mind
Waiting for you

It's like you lost your home and the shelter's gone
You're stuck in the storm outside
Feels like you've gone blind and you can't see life
But it's right before your eyes

The wall keeps on turning
But we've stopped both on different sides
Our hearts keep on loving
It's only a matter of space and timing
Till we align

Coming up to breathe 'cause I've been a long way down
'Cause when we both leave
As far as I can find is I watch you go

Like you lost your home and the shelter's gone
And you're stuck in the storm outside
Feels like you've gone blind and you can't see life
But it's right before your eyes

The wall keeps on turning
But we've stopped both on different sides
Our hearts keep on loving
It's only a matter of space and time
Till we align

The wall keeps on turning
But we've stopped both on different sides
Our hearts keep on loving
It's only a matter of space and time
Till we align
