Once upon a time, not too long ago, we took a day out in Manchester
We all fall down, there's not enough hours in the day
Played a bit of football, fell into the union
Barged our way into the toilet with a kung fu kick
There's not enough hours in the day

I remember seeing someone dressed in a suit, looking like a lunatic
And we all fall down, there's not enough hours in our trip
Well, academy cogwheels breaking your hand
But we got lovely posters for sale
And we all fall down, there's not enough hours in a day

We like loving, yeah, and the wine we share
We like loving, yeah, and the wine we share

Finally made our way back to the train, rolling into Sheffield tonight
And it all falls down, there's not enough hours in our life
So try and guess my weight, waiting at the station
Whippin' Piccadilly tonight, and it all falls down
There's not enough hours in our life

We like loving, yeah, and the wine we share
We like loving, yeah, and the wine we share
