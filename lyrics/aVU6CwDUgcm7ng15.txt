Everybody listen up and shut your mouth
As a matter of fact, you better write this down
Don't you ever wish that you had more stuff?
Follow what I say and we'll get you hooked up

Don't even worry about the haters
Think about yourself for once
Go on and get you some

Go do a b&e
It's so cool, you gotta see
You can get your kicks and so much shit
You almost can't believe, so come on

I'll keep a lookout just to make sure it's safe
You go do the work and gimme half the take
If the cops show up, I'm leaving with or without you
If you can't pay attention then I'm sorry 'bout you

Don't even worry about the haters
Think about yourself for once
Find a nice spot, no one home, no dogs
Then just avoid the cops and the neighborhood watch

Go do a b&e
It's so cool, you gotta see
You can get your kicks and so much shit
You almost can't believe
So go do a b&e
You'll live out all of your wildest dreams
So long as all your wildest dreams are pawning jewelry
So cool, you can't believe
So, come on
