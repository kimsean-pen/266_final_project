I been feeling kinda strange lately
I don't know what's going on, baby
Ever since I came back from out of town
Something's telling me some bullshit is going down

Boy is it someone else you're seeking
Is it someone else
Movado's telling me you're creeping
Finding numbers in your jeans
You're talking in your sleep
Fed up letters written by me get o-you-t

No more sitting at home alone
While you're out with somebody else
No more staring at the phone
Cause I can do better by myself

Yeah, it's obvious how things have changed within a year
Just give me half of the rent and get out of here
No more talking save your lies for somebody else
Keep on walking 'cos I can do better by myself

I gave you all, all of my time
But you would not know a good thing
If it stares you in your face
