Put your eyes up and dazzle all my mind
Come on and trample my dreams with the weight of your heels
You know I feel like I could walk the line
I feel your gaze over me like a bruise in my ears

Crumble the pavement, crumble the clouds
Crumble heaven and make it real

Dance, tonight
Like you're never gonna die, I'm the catcher in the rye
I'm your ghost
And I will never let you down

Dance, tonight
Like you're never gonna die, I'm the catcher in the rye
I'm your ghost
And I will never let you down

Baby get out, we're gonna cross the town
I hope we'll avoid all crooks and the crowd on the road
I'll find a peaceful place beyond the buzz
They will be lost in a tang with a queen and a [?]

Crumble the pavement, crumble the clouds
Crumble heaven and make it real

Dance, tonight
Like you're never gonna die, I'm the catcher in the rye
I'm your ghost
And I will never let you down

Dance, tonight
Like you're never gonna die, I'm the catcher in the rye
I'm your ghost
And I will never let you down

Dance, tonight
Like you're never gonna die, I'm the catcher in the rye
I'm your gost
And I will never let you down

Dance, tonight
Like you're never gonna die, I'm the catcher in the rye
I'm your gost
And I will never let you down
