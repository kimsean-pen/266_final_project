Our primal instincts getting wasted on impulses we've created and now our welcomes overstayed
Misused adrenaline sets in

Everyone's wrong and now look the sun is dimming
Kill us all off and then start a new beginning
Understand that my last steps are gonna follow you
Misused adrenaline won't win

I was made aware of the fact that there's no turning back
Strengthen cognitive infections
Start a brand new plague

Everyone questions everything you stand for
Fight then flight
Left right
And uppercut their mouth shut

Our central purpose seems to be buried by currency as needs
Good grief my outlook has checked out
Misused adrenaline kicks in

Maybe I'm wrong but now look the sun is falling
Most of our day to day choices are appalling
Understand that my last words are gonna mention you
Misused adrenaline you win

There's no turning back
Strengthen cognitive infections
Start a brand new plague

Everyone questions everything you stand for
Fight then flight
Left right
And uppercut their mouth closed shut
