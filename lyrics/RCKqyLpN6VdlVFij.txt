Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face and
I just can not hide it

Meeting Mr. Right, the man of my dreams
The one who shows me true love, or at least it seems
With brown cocoa skin and curly black hair
It's just the way he looks at me that gentle loving stare

Finally you've come along
The way I feel about you, it just can't be wrong
If you only knew the way I feel about you
I just can't describe it, oh no no

Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just can not hide it

Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just can not hide it

It seems so many times
He seemed to be the one
But all he ever wanted was to have a little fun
But now you've come along
And brightened up my world
In my heart I feel it
I'm that special kind of girl

Finally you've come along
The way I feel about you, it just can't be wrong
If you only knew the way I feel about you
I just can't describe it, oh no no

Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just can not hide it

Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just can not hide it

Finally
Oh, finally

Finally you've come along
The way I feel about you, it just can't be wrong
If you only knew the way I feel about you
I just can't describe it, oh no no

Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just can not hide it

Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
