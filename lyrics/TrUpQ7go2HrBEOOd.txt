You are haunted by the tremor of your light
Walking circles, crossing lines
And if the stirring of your soul, of this fury
Jumping hurdles, just to abide

You are turning sorrow with opinions and opinions
Nobody can hear you
Nobody can hear you
This is psychosis
This is psychosis
This is the jigsaw blown apart

You are the ghost of Utopia
You're the concrete stunt, the divided heart
You are the ghost of Utopia
You're the miracle of America

Every time you learn you don't regret
All your hurting, all your debts
Cause the whip and kiss won't help you to forget
The emergency of your secrets and your trash

You are turning sorrow with opinions and opinions
Nobody can hear you
Nobody can hear you
This is psychosis
This is psychosis
This is the jigsaw blown apart

You are the ghost of Utopia
You're the concrete start, the divided heart
You are the ghost of Utopia
You're the miracle of America

You are turning sorrow with opinions and opinions
Nobody can hear you
Nobody can hear you
This is psychosis
This is psychosis
This is psychosis
This is psychosis
This is psychosis
This is psychosis
