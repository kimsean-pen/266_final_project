I know it's not the right time tonight
But I won't move until this stops
Go back to the top
Back to the top
You never belonged to me

Now I can see the light
That you are
Never good at controlling me
Now I can see the light
Shining, whole
And I know, I know it was blinding you

Say, life can be long
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Wanna know it's true
When you say
You gotta get me to hear you
I know it's not the right time tonight
But I won't move until this stops
Go back to the top

Back to the top
I'm not scared if you run to me
Lost like when you were mine
And you continue to run from me
Just offer me your time

Stay, life can be long
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Wanna know it's true
When you say

I want you around
You gotta make me believe you
Oooooh
I know it's not the right time tonight
But I won't move until this stops
Go back to the top
Back to the top
Oooooh
I know it's not the right time tonight
But I won't move until this stops
Go back to the top
Back to the top
Oooooh
I know it's not the right time tonight
But I won't move until this stops
Go back to the top
Back to the top
