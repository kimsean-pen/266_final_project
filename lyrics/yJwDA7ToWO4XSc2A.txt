I, I've been looking for a while
Been searching for a sign
Enjoying to ignite
I, I've been chasseing highs and lows
But don't know where to go
It's could be a bumpy ride
When you feel other way
What you do?
What you do?
Fade away
Hate to say
So what you do?
What you do?
Raise it up lighter, lighter
Dare it up higher, higher
When you feel other way
What you do?
What you do?
(What you do? What you do?)
What you do?
What you do?
(What you do? What you do?)
You, you don't wanna be alone
Hiding in a safety zone
Tell my what is on your mind
When your head is in the clouds
Watch you hang out
And be proud
So come one and light the stars
When you feel other way
What you do?
What you do?
Fade away
Hate to say
So what you do?
What you do?
Raise it up lighter, lighter
Dare it up higher, higher
When you feel other way
What you do?
What you do?
(What you do? What you do?)
What you do?
What you do?
(What you do? What you do?)
Look at me
Look at me
I want for you make your dreams
If you wanna it, you take it
Look at my lullaby singin': Aaaa!
When you feel other way
What you do?
What you do?
Fade away
Hate to say
So what you do?
What you do?
Raise it up lighter, lighter
Dare it up higher, higher
When you feel other way
What you do?
What you do?
What you do?
What you do?
