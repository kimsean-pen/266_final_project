I feel like I'm walking in the sky
Whoa Whoa
Yesterday, tears were in my eyes
Whoa Whoa

Have a bad day, yeah I've been there before
But I keep my head up so I don't have those anymore
I made a choice to be the best that I could ever be
Gotta stay positive, ignore the negativity

I'm gonna follow my intuition
Telling myself to listen
Everything's gonna be OK
It's gonna be a good day
Whooa whooa oh oh whoa whoa
It's gonna be a good day
Follow my Intuition
It's gonna be good day

I gotta go with what feels right
Whoa whoa
Don't always need a reason why
Whoa whoa

What's the problem?
Compared to the weight of the world
Quit trying to please every man, woman, boy and girl
Better pick up the pace
There ain't no time to waste
Tomorrow's never promised so I started living for today

I'm gonna follow my intuition
Telling myself to listen
Everything's gonna be OK
It's gonna be a good day
Whooa whooa oh oh whoa whoa
It's gonna be a good day
Follow my Intuition
It's gonna be a good day

All I know is that I just gotta let go
yeah lookin back it's always easy to know
Sometimes it's just gets so confusing
Feel like I don't know what I'm doing

But I trust in my heart and in the end
It turns out to be better than when it begins
You see what's meant to be it's gonna happen
"You know it's gonna be a good day"

Gonna follow my intuition
I said it's gonna be a good day
Everything's gonna be OK
It's gonna be a good day
Whooa whooa oh oh whoa whoa
It's gonna be a good day
I follow my intuition
It's gonna be a good day
Whooa whooa oh oh whoa whoa
It's gonna be a good day
I follow my intuition
