You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you'll find
You get what you need
You get what you need

I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
Oh I knew she was gonna meet her connection
At her feet was a footloose man

No, you can't (You can't always get what you want)
Oh, no, no you can't (You can't always get what you want)
What you want... (You can't always get what you want)
You can't always get what you want

But if you try sometimes, well, you just might find
You get what you need (Hey, yeah...)
You get what you need (Oh, baby...)

And I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singin' we're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't, we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse
Sing it to me now

You can't always get what you want (Oh, no you can't)
You can't always get what you want (Oh, oh)
You can't always get what you want (Can't always get what you want)
But if you try sometimes, well, you just might find (Try sometimes)
You get what you need (Ohhh...)
You get what you need (Ohhh, yeah...)

You can't always get what you want (You can't always get what you want)
You can't always get what you want (Oooh...)
You can't always get what you want (Can't always get what you want)
But if you try sometimes, well, you just might find
You get what you need (Oh yeah)

You can't always get what you want (No, no, no, no, no...)
You can't always get what you want (No, no, no, no)
You can't always get what you want (Ohhh...)
But if you try sometimes, well, you just might find
You get what you need (Yeah...)
You get what you need

You can't always get what you want
You get what you need
Oh, yeah, what you need, yeah
Get... what... you... need!
