I've got a sudden itch
They're gonna raise my rent
I'm gonna run around, let people know I don't need this

I want to, I like to, I'm gonna file yeah
March around, through the town, it's all goin' down wow

Stay, wait
Doesn't matter what they say, fake
Doesn't matter if we fake all of it for the sake of a fix
We can taste what it's like to love

I don't know you very well
But they don't have to know that
We don't have to show that

Been a little while since we played as kids
I found it impressive the way you worked those wooden limbs
But she's amazing for every occasion
I want a lot more of your mom around
I'm sad she's gone and couldn't have more time
To notice all the ways her bright ass shines
But he's impatient
Creeps on Brayden
No one really likes your dad around

Stay, wait
Doesn't matter what they say, fake
Doesn't matter if we fake all of it for the sake of a fix
We can taste what it's like to love

I'm at the top of my little world
But I never felt so alone
The more it seems like I've grown up the more
I've been shrinking in

I drown myself in material
Waiting for some kind of punishment
But consequence don't make no sense
When there's nobody there who gives a damn

I don't know you very well
But they don't have to know that
We don't have to show that

Now that's winter's over and you got an apartment
I think about the times when we shaved our armpits
And she was gracious
Knew we were wasted
I wish we had more of your mom around
The big city life is getting busy and hectic
We should reconnect and have sex in my Lexus
And he was racist
Except for asians
And no one really likes your dad around

Stay, wait
Doesn't matter what they say, fake
Doesn't matter if we fake all of it for the sake of a fix
We can taste what it's like to love

Stay, wait
Does it matter if I pay? Fake
Doesn't matter if you make me believe you can feel anything
I can vaguely relate to love
