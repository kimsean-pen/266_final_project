Existing on damnation's edge, the priest had never known
To witness such a violent show of power overthrown
Angels fighting aimlessly still dying by the sword
Our legions killing all in sight to get the one called Lord

The gates of Hell lie waiting as you see
There's no price to pay, just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved

Crucify you so called Lord, He soon shall fall to me
Your souls are damned, your God has fell to slave for me eternally
Hell awaits

The Reaper guards the darkened gates that Satan calls his home
Demons feed the furnace where the dead are free to roam
Lonely children of the night, there's seven ways to go
Each leading to the burning hole the Lucifer controls

Priests of Hades seek the sacred star
Satan sees the answer lies not far
Zombies screaming, souls cry out to you
Satanic laws prevail, your life is through

Pray to the moon when it is round
Death with you shall then abound
What you seek for can't be found
In sea or sky or underground

Now I have you deep inside my everlasting grasp
The seven bloody gates of Hell is where you'll live your last
Warriors from Hell's domain will bring you to your death
The flames of Hades burning strong, your soul shall never rest

The gates of Hell lie waiting as you see
There's no price to pay, just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved

Sacrifice the lives of all, I know they soon shall die
Their souls are damned to rot in Hell and keep the fire growing deep inside
Hell awaits
