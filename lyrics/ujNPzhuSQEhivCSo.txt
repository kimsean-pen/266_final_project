This is my white shadow
A shadow of myself
This is the last shadow
There's no one left to blame
You are my black widow
A widow in the rain
You are my eternal widow
And keeping me insane

This is my bright shadow
A shadow of my face
This is the single shadow
There's nothing left to drain
You are my dark widow
A widow in the net
You are my final widow
And I had myself to blame

My heart is blackened
I am dying in your arms
Let this not be
The last dance
The floor collapses as we dance
We are falling apart
This is the world on fire.
This is the end of it all

This is the world on fire
This is where we start to fall

I pray for rain
