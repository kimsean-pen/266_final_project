Millions of girls float on that one quote
Living on their last hope, on their last hope
I lived my life inside a dream
Only waking when I sleep
I would sell my sorry soul
If I could have it all

My life is a play, is a play, is a play
My life is a play, is a play, is a play

Yeah, I've been living in the state of dreaming
Living in a make-believe land
Living in the state of dreaming, of dreaming, of dreaming

All I really want is to be wonderful
People in this town they, they can be so cruel
I lived my life inside a dream
Only waking when I sleep
I would sell my sorry soul
If I could have it all

My life is a play, is a play, is a play
My life is a play, is a play, is a play

Yeah, I've been living in the state of dreaming
Living in a make-believe land
Living in the state of dreaming, of dreaming, of dreaming

If only you knew my dear
How I live my life in fear
If only you knew my dear
How I know my time is near

Yeah, I've been living in the state of dreaming
Living in a make believe land
Living in the state of dreaming, of dreaming, of dreaming

Yeah, I've been living in the state of dreaming
Living in a make-believe land
Living in the state of dreaming, of dreaming, of dreaming

My life is a play, is a play, is a play
