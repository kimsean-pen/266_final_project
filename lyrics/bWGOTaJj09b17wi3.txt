Well have you ever lived down in the ghetto?
Have you ever felt that cold wind blow?
Well if you don't know what I mean
Won't you stand up and scream?
'cause there's things goin' on that you don't know

Too many lives they spent across the ocean
Too much money they spent upon the moon
Well until they make it right
I hope they never sleep at night
They better make some changes and do it soon

Do it now
Do it good

Well they're gonna ruin the air that we breathe Lord have mercy
They're gonna ruin us all by and by
I'm telling all you beware
I don't think they really care
Think they just sit up there
And just get high

Well have you ever lived down in the ghetto?
Have you ever felt that cold wind blow?
Well if you don't know what I mean
Won't you stand up and scream?
'cause there's things goin' on that you don't know
Well if you don't know what I mean
Won't you stand up and scream?
'cause there's things goin' on that you don't know
Tell it
Tell it, tell it.
