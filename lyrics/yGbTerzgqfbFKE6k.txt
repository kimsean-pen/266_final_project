Oooh, all this time I was just running around
A beautiful mind between those eyes
I wasn't looking, but oh I found
A gap in the clouds, the sun comes out
We'll stay up all night make you feel alive
Oh life, oh life

Oh my dear, don't be afraid
Oh my heart, speak up
And it could come back to life someday
Who really knows the truth
Life's what you make it
And I wanna make it with you
Oh you, oh you, ohh

Oooh, all this time I was just running around
A beautiful mind between those eyes
I wasn't looking, but oh I found
A gap in the clouds, the sun comes out
We'll stay up all night make you feel alright
Oh life, oh life

Oh, I've been dancing for quite a while
It's cold out but those blue eyes they smile
Oh, that smile

Oooh, all this time I was just running around
A beautiful mind between those eyes
I wasn't looking, but oh I found
A gap in the clouds, the sun comes out
We'll stay up all night make you feel alright
Oh life, oh life
