Human beings are magical creatures
We can see what doesn't exist and choose to rise above what is (hmm)
Unlike any other, humans can feel without having to have actually felt
We can share each other's pain or joy
One might use such a power to destroy
Rather than to build up or support

Lately I've been feeling
(Somethin gotta change and I'm)
Tempted to get even
(Find someone to blame but I)
Don't gotta go that low
Keepin it, Keepin it in control
Got me at my weakest, oh no

I, coming back I'm gonna take what's
Mine, cause nobody else gonna save my
Life,

Goin up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I'll show em
I'm not broken
I'm still goin
Oh, didn't you know I'll be my own redemption

No manipulation
(I ain't gonna buy it again)
So over all the faking
(Searchin for the real thing)
I ain't got the energy
Why you be, why you be testing me
Now I'm outta patience

I, coming back I'm gonna take what's
Mine, cause nobody else gonna save my
Life, seeing so clear with my own two eyes
My eyes

I'm not broken
I'm still goin
Goin up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I'll show em
I'm not broken
I'm still goin
Oh, didn't you know I'll be my own redemption

I'll be, I'll be my own redemption
My own redemption

I'm not broken
I'm still goin
Goin up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I'll show em
I'm not broken
I'm still goin
Oh, didn't you know I'll be my own redemption
