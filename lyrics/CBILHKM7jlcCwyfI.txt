Men on the TV
Told me I'm needy
Told me I'm everything that they are

But I am able
Yes, I am stable
I know that all Ogres fall

Down, down, down, down
Down to where they all came from
Down to where they belong

Hold me close, boy
Don't let me fall
Down, down, down
just like an Ogre

So on the surface
Everything's perfect
Everything's just the way as it it
But I am able
Yes, I am stable
i know that all things go
Down to where they belong

Hei! Oh-oh!

I don't want you to be afraid
To be afraid
Don't be afraid
It's just a minor mistake
Not worth mentioning

Hold me close, boy
Don't let me fall
Down, down, down
just like an Ogre

Hold me close, boy
Don't let me fall
Down, down, down
I'm scared of Ogres
