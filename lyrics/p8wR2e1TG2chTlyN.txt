Well I told you
Take what you're given
Life is for living, but darling
You, you told me
Well I don't give a damn
Just take me as I am

No, no, no
I can't go
I don't give a damn
Just take me as I am

And oh we live like we want to
Where nobody tells you
I want to believe
Come on just set me free
Oh we live in the dark days
Like some kind of black haze
I want to come down
But I'm never, never coming down

I never told you what this life is about
I spent two hundred years wandering around
Good god
You've never been here, I want to take you home
Why won't you come by
I will never let you go

Oh we live like we want to
Where nobody tells you
I want to believe
Come on just set me free
Oh we live in the dark days
Like some kind of black haze
I want to come down
But I'm never, ever ever ever coming down

I want to believe
But you won't deceive
I wanted to die
But you will never set me free
I wanted to take
All of your fate
I wanted to leave
But you are nothing without me
You're nothing
You're nothing
You're nothing without me

Well I can't stop, keep the kids going
I can't stop, keep the kids going
I can't stop, keep the kids going
Can't stop, can't stop me
Well I can't stop, keep the kids going
I can't stop now, yeah
I can't stop now, yeah
Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop me now

We live like we want to
Where nobody tells you
I want to believe
Come on just set me free
Oh we live in the dark days
Like some kind of black haze
I want to come down
But I'm never, never coming down

I want to believe
But you won't deceive
I wanted to die
But you will never set me free
I wanted to take
All of your fate
I wanted to leave
But you are nothing without me
You're nothing
You're nothing
You're nothing without me
