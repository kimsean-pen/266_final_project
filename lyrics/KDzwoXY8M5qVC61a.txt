I'm not with you anymore
But I still dream about it
You're the tumor in my head
And I can't live without it

Cause I remember when
I remember all I can
Yes I remember when
And I'm trying to forget
You

We're not 18 anymore
But we've still got our habits
You're the creature in my heart
And you're about to devour it

Cause I remember when
I remember all I can
Yes I remember when
And I'm trying to forget
You
