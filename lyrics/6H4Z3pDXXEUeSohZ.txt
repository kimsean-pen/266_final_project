One, two, three, four
Uu-uu

While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
'Till the mountains crumble into the plain

Ooh, yes, we'll keep on tryin'
Tread that fine line
Ooh, we'll keep on tryin'
Just passing our time

Uu-uu
While we live according to race, colour or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the aeons, and on and on

Ooh, yes, we'll keep on tryin'
We'll tread that fine line
Ooh, we'll keep on tryin'
'Till the end of time
'Till the end of time

Through the sorrow, all through our splendour
Don't take offence at my innuendo
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
Surrender your ego, be free, be free to yourself

Uu-uu
If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
If there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself destroy our fears, release your mask

Ooh, yes, we'll keep on tryin'
Tread that fine line
Yes, we'll keep on smiling
And whatever will be - will be!

Keep on tryin'
Just keep on tryin'
'Till the end of time
'Till the end of time
'Till the end of time
