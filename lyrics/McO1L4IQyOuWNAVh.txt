Taking time
to walk down all the aisles.

Turning over every stone.
Building new rulers
but still haven't burnt any old.

Please don't let me down this time.
I've come a long way to just fold back into line.

Keep both feet on the ground
while I change the wings.

I promise one day I'll be coming around
from my cloud to see what it's all about.

But please don't let me down this time.
I've come a long way to just fold back into line.

Please hold me back
if I tend to lose it and steer into old tracks.

Please don't let me down this time.
I've come a long way to just fold back into line
