It's hidden far away but someday I may tell
The tale of metal tangle when into your world I fell
Without you now I wander soaking secretly afraid
But in your grasp the fears don't last though some of them have stayed

I wheeled around because I, I didn't hear what you had said
And saw you dancing with Elihu up on Leemor's bed
And I was foggy rather groggy, you helped me to my car
The binding belt enclosing me, a sample in a jar

And on the market stands unfolding with all their willies and their wares
I shuffle by alert but numb to all the glances and the glares
I think of you unheeding all the times I raise my cup
It's now I know that you knew that I'd soon end up, end up

I wheeled around because I, I didn't hear what you had said
And saw you dancing with Elihu up on Leemor's bed
And I was foggy rather groggy, you helped me to my car
The binding belt enclosing me, a sample in a jar

You tricked me like the others and now I don't belong
The simple smiles and good times seem all wrong

I wheeled around because I, I didn't hear what you had said
And saw you dancing with Elihu up on Leemor's bed
And I was foggy rather groggy, you helped me to my car
The binding belt enclosing me, a sample in a jar

Sample in a jar
A sample in a jar
Now, sample in a jar
