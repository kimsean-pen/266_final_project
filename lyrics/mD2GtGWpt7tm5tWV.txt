You get up so early
It's darker than it's light
And you don't wanna see me
Paranoid
Making me feel guilty
Just like you have all along
Trap me with your body
Wake me up

Problem is
We hesitate
Find out what you're hating
Let's be straight
And never say
How we are absolutely failing

Someone call it now
And pull me away
I'm just waking up and all I wanna say is
We are, we are, we are, we are, yeh
Yeh we're absolutely failing
(Yeh we're absolutely failing)

Everything is blurry
Turbulent then calm
Teeth are sinking deeper
Kill me first
Wind me up the wrong way
Edible words are your worst
Choose another flavour
Wake me up

The problem is
What we do underneath the table
Trouble is
That ignorance is who we are
Absolutely blameless

Someone call it now
And pull me away
I'm just waking up and all I wanna say is
We are, we are, we are, we are, yeh
Yeh we're absolutely failing

We have got so much, so much to learn
And what am I missing? What is it you've heard?
'Cos we are, we are, we are, we are, yeh
Yeh we are absolutely failing
Wake me up

Ahh... Whatya waiting for?
'Cos I... put you out of my head
Why do we always pretend
Like we could ever be friendly
I'd forgotten to mention that

Someone call it now
And pull me away
I'm just waking up and all I wanna say is
We are, we are, we are, we are, yeh
Yeh we're absolutely failing
Wake me up
We have got so much, so much to learn
What am I missing? What is it you've heard?
'Cos we are, we are, we are, we are, yeh
Yeh we are absolutely failing

We are, we are, we are, we are, yeh
We are, we are, we are, we are, yeh
We are, we are, we are, we are, yeh
Yeh we are absolutely failing
Wake me up
