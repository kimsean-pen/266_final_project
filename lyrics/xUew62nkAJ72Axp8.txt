I bought a brand new airmobile
It custom made, it 'twas a Flight DeVille

Pow'ful motor and some hideaway wings
Push in on the button and you will hear her sing

Now you can't catch me, baby you can't catch me
'Cause if you get too close, you know I'm gone like a cool breeze

New Jersey Turnpike in the wee wee hours
I was rolling slowly 'cause of drizzlin' showers

Here come a flat-top, he was movin' up with me
Then come wavin' goodbye, in a little, old suped-up Jitney

I put my foot in my tank and I begin to roll
Moanin' sirens, 'twas the state patrol

So I let out my wings and then I blew my horn
Bye-bye New Jersey I've become airborne

Now you can't catch me, baby you can't catch me
'Cause if you get too close, you know I'm gone like a cool breeze

Flyin' with my baby last Saturday night
Wasn't a grey cloud floatin' in sight

Big full moon shinin' up above
Cuddle up honey, be my love

Sweetest little thing I ever seen
I'm gonna name you Mabelline

Flyin' on the beam set on flight control
Radio tuned to rock 'n' roll

Two, three hours a-passed us by
Altitude dropped to 505

Fuel consumption way too fast
Let's get on home before we run out of gas

Now you can't catch me, baby you can't catch me
'Cause if you get too close, you know I'm gone like a cool breeze
