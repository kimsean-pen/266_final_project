I get 'round
I feel love
And you can't kick me down
Keep making my way to be free
I'm not gonna be after your ground

u-u-u-u why

Should I let someone
To kick me down
Keep on running away
To be free
I'm not gonna be after your ground

u-u-u-u why

I don't feel the same as you
I'm about to turn the page now
Need to get away from you
Need to keep on fighting of you

I'm not gonna play no rules
'Coz I need to save my divine
All I wanna say is
Goodbye

I get 'round
I feel love
And you can't kick me down
Keep making my way to be free
I'm not gonna be after your ground

u-u-u-u why

Should I let someone
To kick me down
Keep on running away
To be free
I'm not gonna be after your ground

u-u-u-u why

If you talk about my life
You know inside you're dying
You'll have another ride
'Coz you're never gonna change mine

I don't wanna stand the rules
I'm about to break my divine
All I wanna say is
Goodbye

I get 'round
I feel love
And you can't kick me down
Keep making my way to be free
I'm not gonna be after your ground

u-u-u-u why

Should I let someone
To kick me down
Keep running away
To be free
I'm not gonna be after your ground

u-u-u-u why

I feel love
And you can't kick me down
Keep making my way to be free
I'm not gonna be after your ground

u-u-u-u why

Should I let someone
To kick me down
Keep running away
To be free
I'm not gonna be after your ground

u-u-u-u why

I get 'round
I feel love
And you can't kick me down
Keep making my way to be free
I'm not gonna be after your ground

u-u-u-u why

Should I let someone
To kick me down
Keep running away
To be free
I'm not gonna be after your ground
