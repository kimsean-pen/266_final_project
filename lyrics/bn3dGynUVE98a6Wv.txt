I know you usually don't hear me talk like this
But I got a little game that I want to play
Are you ready?

When I think about you
I think about giving myself to you
'Cause you know I want you babe
And I will do anything
I know your thinking the same thing babe

So come and get it, get it (come and get it babe)
I'm so excited
I can't hide my feelings (I cant hide my feelings) get it
I won't stop until we start over and finish (finish)
Tonight it's all about my baby
I'm feenin' for you get me high
I can't stop you feel me right?

Close the door
Bed or floor
I just want more
I can't get enough of you
What I got in store
It's all of yours
I just want more
I can't get enough of you

Close the door
Bed or floor
I want more
I can't get enough of you
What I got in store
It's all of yours
I just want more
I can't get enough of you

When I think about us
I think about the way that we make love
The way that you make me sweat
Make me want a cigarette
And I ain't no smokin' chick
But you got me wantin' it
So don't stop (yeah)
You making me high
I feel it right there (yeah)
We tossing and turning
So keep it right there (yeah)
My adrenaline is pumping right
Stomach muscles getting tight
Skin so wet my fingers slide

Gone take you to a place
You ain't never been (again and again, want you to feel it baby)
Ooh ooh

I'm 'bout to handle my business that's (you)
Make sure you handle me too

Close the door
Bed or floor
I just want more
I can't get enough (I can't get enough baby) of you
What I got in store
It's all of yours
I just want more
I can't get enough of you

Close the door (ooh baby)
Bed or floor
I just want more
'Cause I can't get enough of you
What I got in store
It's all of yours
I just want more
'Cause I can't get enough of you

Come back baby, who's gonna be first to yell out
I know you'll lose after the second round
Then the consequence, maybe, that you'll have to switch to third round
And make me scream like when I put it down (now)

Put on a little show
To let you baby know
By then I should be screaming uncontrollably
Hope your ready to stay up
One time is not enough (one time)
'Cause nothings too much baby
You're just what I want baby

Close the door
Bed or floor (I want you)
I want more (I need you baby)
I can't get enough of you
What I got in store (baby what I got in store)
It's all of yours
I just want more (it's all yours)
I can't get enough of you (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Close the door (baby I just want to play)
Bed or floor (until you take my breath away)
I want more
I can't get enough of you (do you feel me)
What I got in store
It's all of yours (I know you do)
I just want more ('cause I feel you too)
I can't get enough of you (I can't get enough of you)

Close the door
Bed or floor
I want more ('cause I can't get enough of it)
I can't get enough of you
What I got in store (it's all)
It's all of yours (all yours)
I just want more (I just want that little bit more) I can't get enough of you

Close the door (when you think it's over)
Bed or floor (we're starting again)
I want more (this time we'll make it last)
I can't get enough of you (it won't end)
What I got in store (no no)
It's all of yours (I just want it)
I just want more
I can't get enough of you (I can't get enough of you)
