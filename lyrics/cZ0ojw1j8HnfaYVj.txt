The way you move when you're sleeping
The way you breathe when you're leaving
I know you more then I know myself

Mm, and when you're home feel your footsteps
I can't allow in the darkness
In the darkness

They say our love won't last forever
They could be wrong
And when they say our love won't last forever
They could be wrong
They could be wrong

The way you smile when I'm speaking
I feel how clearly you see me
How clearly you see me

They say our love won't last forever
They could be wrong
And when they say our love won't last forever
They could be wrong
They could be wrong
They could be wrong
They could be wrong

(Ooh)
We could be wrong

Hear me out
Just hear me out
Oh hear me out
Just hear me out
Oh hear me out
Just hear me out
Oh hear me out
Just hear me out
(They say our love won't last forever)
Hear me now
Just hear me now
Oh hear me now
Don't push me out
(They say our love won't last forever)
Oh hear me now
Don't push me out
Oh hear me now
They say our love
Oh they could be wrong
Yeah they could be wrong
We proved ourselves wrong
They say our love won't last forever
They say our love won't last forever
