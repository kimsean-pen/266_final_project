Well, I'm goin' away to leave
Won't be back no mo'
Goin' back down south, child
Don't you want to go

Woman, I'm troubled
I be all worried in mind
Well, baby, I just can't be satisfied
And I just can't keep from cryin'

Well, I feel like snappin'
A pistol in your face
I'm gonna let some graveyard
Lord, be her resting place

Woman, I'm troubled
I be all worried in mind
Well, baby, I can' t ever be satisfied
And I just can't keep from cryin'

Well, now all in my sleep
Hear my doorbell ring
Looking for my baby
I couldn't see not a doggone thing

Woman, I was troubled
I was all worried in mind
Well, honey, I could never be satisfied
And I just couldn't keep from cryin'

Well, I know my little old baby
She gonna jump and shout
That old train delayed me
Lord, and I come walking out

And I mean troubled
I be all worried in mind
Well, honey, ain't no way in the world for me to be satisfied
And I just can't keep from cryin'
