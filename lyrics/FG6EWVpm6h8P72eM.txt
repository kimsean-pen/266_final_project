Can't stop my thoughts from gathering energy
Can't separate the real from day to day
Thoughts from unfamiliar
Outside the picture
Life is strange in some familiar way

Before you know where you are
If falls apart

Celebration
In control of you
Transformation
Into something new

Before you know where you are
It falls apart

Can't seem to keep my head in reality
Fear and emotion day to day
Strange in familiar ways
Relevant thoughts have strayed

Before you know where you are
It falls apart

Celebration
In control of you
Transformation
Into something new

Celebration
In control of you
Transformation
Into something new

Before you know where you are
It falls apart
Before you know where you are
It falls apart
Before you know where you are
It falls apart
Before you know where you are
It falls apart
Before you know where you are
It falls apart
