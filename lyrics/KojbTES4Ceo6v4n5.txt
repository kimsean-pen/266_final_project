Quiet now, your voice seems miles away
Yet somehow, I hear your song resound
A little bit softer each day
And from my tired heart, a little bit farther away

I'll sing along
The whole day through
Just do your best to hear me
It's all you can do

You have my attention
Like you've had all the while
Since that first day when you made my heart smile
With loving eyes and tired sighs that flow
You have my attention
Like a shout through an empty sanctuary
Speak but a whisper

I'll hear a sermon
I'll sing along, the whole day through
Just do your best to hear me
It's all you can do
I'll sing along, the whole night through
While you sleep safely
I'll be thinking about you

You have my attention.
