She doesn't look, she doesn't see
Opens up for nobody
Figures out, she figures out
Narrow line, she can't decide
Everything short of suicide
Never hurts, nearly works
Something is scratching
It's way out
Something you want
To forget about
A part of you that'll never show
You're the only one that'll ever know
Take it back when it all began
Take your time, would you understand
What it's all about?
What it's all about?
Something is scratching it's way out
Something you want
To forget about
No one expects
You get up
All on your own with
No one around
Something is scratching it's way out
Something you want
To forget aboutNo one expects
You get up
All on your own with
No one around
