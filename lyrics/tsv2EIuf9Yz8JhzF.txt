Ya running and ya running
And ya Running Away.
Ya running and ya running
And ya Running Away.
Ya running and ya running
And ya Running Away.
Ya running and ya running
But ya can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself.

Ya must have done (must have done)
Somet'in' wrong (something wrong)
Said: ya must have done (must have done)
Wo! Somet'in' wrong (something wrong)

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (Running Away)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (Running Away)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (Running Away)

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (Running Away)

Every man thinketh his
Burden is the heaviest (heaviest)
Every man thinketh his
Burden is the heaviest (heaviest)
Ya still mean it:
Who feels it knows it, Lord

Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord

Who feels it knows it, Lord
Ya running and ya running
And ya Running Away.
Ya running and ya running
And ya Running Away.
Ya running and ya running
And ya Running Away.
Ya running and ya running
But ya can't run away from yourself.
Could ya run away from yourself?

Can you run away from yourself?
Can't run away from yourself!

(Running Away)
And I don't want to live with no strife
(Running Away)
It is better to live on the housetop
(Running Away)
Than to live in a house full of confusion
(Running Away)
So, I made my decision and I left ya
(Running Away)
Now you comin' to tell me
(Running Away)
That I'm runnin' away
(Running Away)
But it's not true
(Running Away)
I am not runnin' away
