Walk this room my love like anything could ha-happen
Lovely crap what if the dose doesn't ma-matter

I did not want to write anything
Just wanted you to taste the ink
Just wanted you to be prepared

When I lie outside up with
The moon my dear companion
By it's light I'll guide my steps
At the bottom of the bottle

I did not want to, to write anything
Just wanted you to taste the ink
I did not want to, to write anything
Just wanted you to taste the ink

Shut her eyes now
And feel anything
Shut her eyes now
And feel anything
Shut her eyes now
And feel anything
Shut her eyes now
And feel anything
Shut her eyes now
And feel anything
