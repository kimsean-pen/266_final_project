Put your name there
All over the bridge
This must be the place
Must be the place
Where your home is
Where would you be?
If you think I'm not scared
Think again
I'm just a wreck
I can't fight over trust

Well I make it to heaven
Can this pill make me forget
I'm forever I still can't believe it
Yeah, yeah
Can't believe

Will I make it to heaven
Can this pill make me forget
I'm forever and still I can't believe
Can't believe
