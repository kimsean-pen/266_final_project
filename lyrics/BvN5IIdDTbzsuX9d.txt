Love is forever as I lie awake
Beside you
I believed, there's no heaven
No hideaway, for the lonely

But I was wrong, crazy
It's gotta be strong
It's gotta be right

Only wanted to stay a while (Woah,woah, woah)
Only wanted to play a while (Woah, woah, woah)
Then you taught me to fly like a bird (Woah, woah, woah)

Baby, thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Such a night I never had before
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Cause what I got there ain't no cure for

Oooh it's so easy
What you do to me all night angel
I never loved, I swear to God
Never needed no one, 'til you came along

But here I come, yeah baby
It's gotta be strong - it's gotta be right
Only wanted to stay awhile (Woah, woah, woah)
Only wanted to play awhile (Woah, woah, woah)
Then you taught me to fly like a bird (Woah, woah, woah)

Baby - thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Such a night I never had before
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Cause what I got there ain't no cure for

I feel fast asleep, I feel drunk
I dream the sweetest dreams
Never wanna wake up

Never thought it could be this way
No doubt about it, can't live without it, baby
Never thought it could be this good
You made love to me, like it oughta be

But I was wrong - crazy
It's gotta be strong
It's gotta be right
Only wanted to stay awhile (Woah, woah, woah)
Only wanted to play awhile (Woah, woah, woah)
But then you taught me to fly like a dove (Woah woah Woah)
Baby, thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Such a night I never had before
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Cause what I got there ain't no cure for

Gotta say, thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Never thought that I could feel this way
(Thought I'd died and gone to heaven)
It's gotta be love
(It's gotta be love)
It's gotta be love
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Thought I'd died and gone to, heaven, heaven
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
