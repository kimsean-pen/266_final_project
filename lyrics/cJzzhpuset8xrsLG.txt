When the Earth was young
and the air was sweet
and the mountains kissed the sky
and the great beyond with its many pasts
man and nature lived side by side

and this wilderness of danger and beauty
lived three brothers bonded by love
their heart full of joy
their acts now forgotten
reaching out to the skies up above

great spirits of all who lived before
take our hands and lead us
fill our hearts and souls with all you know
show us that in your eyes
we are all the same
brothers to each other
in this world we remain
truly brothers all the same

give us rythm to pass to each other
and give us strength so we understand
that the things we do
the choices we make
give direction to all lifes plans
to look and wonder at all we've been given
in our world its not always as it seems
every corner we turn only leads to another
a journey ends but another begin

great spirits of all who lived before
take our hands and lead us
fill our hearts and souls with all you know
show us that in your eyes
we are all the same
brothers to each other
in this world we remain
truly brothers all the same
