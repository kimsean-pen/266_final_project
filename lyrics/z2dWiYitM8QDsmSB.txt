O amici, o victoria
Gloriam cantabimus
Celebrate hanc victoriam
Pugna inita

Up with our backs against the wall
When this safety is a prison,
There is nothing left to live for

Soon we will rise above it all
When our victims turn to martyrs
Come and join the final encore

The enemy's frightening
We give our all
The bigger they come
The harder they fall

Put on your wings and take the sky
Fly into liberty
All of the anguish set aside
As we are fighting for freedom
Put on your wings and feel alive
Fly out of misery
Reclaiming the land that lies outside
As we are fighting their treason
Shine through the sky
On your wings of freedom

Are we only animals that live inside a jail?
Aching from desire to be free?
There's a world outside if we are not afraid to fail
Come on grab your wings and follow me!

We're not meant to live in this cage
A bird to fly but never crawl
It fills my heart with a fiery rage
The time has come, climb over the wall

Hope will always keep us alive
Our fallen friends won't have died in vain
Strongly armed with our will to survive
Leaving a world full of pain

Our freedom, Quietus
The choice is yours for the taking (yours to take)
Our freedom, the Grim Reaper
In the end is one

I will never settle, living my whole life inside these walls
Show me your will to survive
We are not the cattle, lacking the desire that it falls
Go out reclaim the land
I shall fight for justice, fearless will I face my enemies
We'll make humanity thrive
Now it's time to trust us, come and join the fight because it's
Time to be free, for you and for me, we will not bow down on our knees

To rise above monsters we have to abandon our humanity

Day and night dividing the legions
Ignorance will show its weakness
Lasting peace an abandoned illusion
Blinded by trust in a twilight zone
Day and night disguising their secrets
Ignorance will kill the fearless
Offerings of reckless courage

Going left, going right
This is our final fight
Going east, going west
This is our final quest

Put on your wings and take the sky
Fly into victory
All of the anguish set aside
As we are fighting for freedom
Put on your wings and feel alive
Fly out of misery
Reclaiming the land that lies outside
As we are fighting their treason
Shine through the sky
On your wings of freedom

O amici, o victoria
Gloriam cantabimus
Celebrate hanc victoriam
