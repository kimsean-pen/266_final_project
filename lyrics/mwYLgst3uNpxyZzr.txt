until it's over
until the day is done
i'll look to find you
when all the pain is gone

i will be another
i'll put out my hand
i know you'll look to find it
i know you'll understand

i know it's a time to defined
you would give your life to be desired
i don't want my time to be decided
i can see a lifetime in your eyes

it gave me what i needed
you showed me what i had
too much to leave alone
too much to be unsaid
all of the words are gone
all of the time is spent
nothing to be forgiven
i know you'll understand

i know it's a time to defined
you would give your life to be desired
i don't want my time to be decided
i can see a lifetime in your eyes

underneath the time
underneath the light
i'll be under you
i'll be underneath the light

i know it's a time to defined
you would give your life to be desired
i don't want my time to be decided
i can see a lifetime in your eyes
i know it's a time to defined
you would give your life to be desired
this could be a life you'll never find
you could always leave it all behind
this could be a life you'll never find...
you could always leave it all behind...
this could be a life you'll never find...
this could be a life you'll never find...
