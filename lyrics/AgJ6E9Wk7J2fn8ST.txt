when we were together I was blown away
just like paper from a fan
but you would act like I was just a kid
like we were never gonna' last

but now I've got someone who cares for me, (yeah)
wrote my name in silver sands
I think you know you've lost the love of your life
(you said) I was the best you've ever had

because I'm in demand, (hey)

you're thinking of the way you should've held my, (hand)
and all the times you'd say you didn't understand
you never had our love written in your, (plans)

but now I'm in demand

I never think you saw the best of me (ahh haa haa haa)
there's a side you'll never know
'cos love and loving are two different things (ah haa haa haa)
set your sights far too low

but now I've got someone who cares for me, (yeah)
he wrote my name in silver sands
I think you know you've lost the love of your life
(you said) I was the best you've ever had

because I'm in demand, (hey)

you're thinking of the way you should've held my (hand)
and all the times you'd say you didn't understand
you never had our love written in your plans

but now I'm in demand

you're thinking of the way you've should've of held my (hand)
and all the times you'd say you didn't understand
you never had our love written in your, (plans)

but now I'm in demand

it's only when I fall asleep
I see that winning smile
when my dreams just move along
you've lost the race by miles

yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
stay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

because I'm in demand
you're thinking of the way you should've of held my (hand)
and all the times you'd say you didn't understand
you never had our love in your, (plans)

but now I'm in demand, (yeah)
you know I'm in demand
(say you're in demand)
you know I'm in demand, (yeah)

always in demand, (yeah)

never had our love written in your plans

you know I'm in demand
