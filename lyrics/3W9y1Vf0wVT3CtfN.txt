Madelyn, I share your hate for this world we're in but it makes me a better man.
It's an excuse that you make. Madelyn, I know you want to let the bottles in.
I know you think that they're all your friends. They're lying straight to your face.
I know about the devil in your bloodstream. I know that the ghosts still visit nightly.
I know it must get lonely by the Chesapeake.
Madelyn, are you really afraid of death or do you just say it if it's the right thing to say?
Madelyn, I know you're safe where you lay your head, but if you wanted to come back, I've got a place you could stay.
If I'm not doing right by my family, then what's the point of it anyway? I don't think there's a god.
I don't think that there's someone coming to save us and I don't think that's the worst news of the day.
I don't think there's a god.
I don't think that there's someone coming to save me and I don't think that's the worst news of the day.
Madelyn, I know how your cold scars turn purple.
I know how the Irish goodbyes feel.
I know where you've been
And Madelyn,
You and I got this East Coast blood between us.
It's bitter and vitriolic. I know how it ends.
If I'm not doing right by my family
oh, I'm not doing right by family.
