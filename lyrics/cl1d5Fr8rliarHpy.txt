A man decides after seventy years
That what he goes there for is to unlock the door
While those around him criticize and sleep
And through a fractal on a breaking wall
I see you my friend and touch your face again
Miracles will happen as we dream

But we're never gonna survive unless
We get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna survive unless
We are a little crazy

Yellow people walking through my head
One of them's got a gun, shoot the other one
And yet together they were friends at school
Oh, get it and get it and get it and get it, no no no!
If I were there when we first took the pill
Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe
Miracles will happen as we speak

But we're never gonna survive unless
We get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna survive unless
We are a little crazy

No no, we'll never survive
Unless we get a little bit...

In a sky full of people
Only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy?
In a world full of people
Only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy?
Crazy
In a heaven of people
There's only some want to fly
Ain't that crazy?
Crazy, crazy, crazy...

But we're never gonna survive unless
We get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna survive unless
We are a little crazy

No no, we'll never survive
Unless we get a little bit...
