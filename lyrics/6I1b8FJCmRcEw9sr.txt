Sweat dripping from my body, we both at this party,
So come and show me your moves, I got some things I can teach you too
If you wanna see, oh oh
You say you need a shot of the Henee
Then you're ready
Do what you need to do
Cause I'll be waiting for you
It's about to get hot and heavy, oh oh

It's really late
You're getting closer and the lights off
Your body is in sync to the beat of my heart
And I can feel your nature rising wild and wild on you

Let's dance like we're making love
Making love
Let's dance like we're making love
Making love
Let's dance like we're making love

If you're down just maybe
We dance like we're making babies
As soon as our song comes on
Cause boy we got all night long
So if you're ready
I'm ready to get it
Come on
I see a little faded
You anna get crazy out on this floor
I hope you're sure this is what you want
Cause once I'm turned, you can't turn me off

It's really late
You're getting closer and the lights off
Your body is in sync to the beat of my heart
And I can feel your nature rising wild and wild on you

Let's dance like we're making love
Making love
Let's dance like we're making love
Making love
Let's dance like we're making love

Off the wall
Body to body
You and I
And then out through the night baby
Closer than before
Dance like no one's watching
You and I tonight
Be the time of your life baby

Oh oh

Let's dance like we're making love
Making love
Let's dance like we're making love
Making love
Let's dance like we're making love
