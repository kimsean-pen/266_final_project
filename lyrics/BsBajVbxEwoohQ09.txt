Can you feel it?
The movement across your feet?
Take one last look.
Can you see it?
The dragging across your feet?
Take one last look.

Take one last look.

Can't even wrap my head around the situation
Can't even wrap my head around you
Can't even wrap my head around the situation
Can't even wrap my head around you

Try to keep your head above the water
Can't even wrap my head around...

Weightless and unbound

Oh dear, we all drown
The visions will keep us going
Take off these wet clothes
