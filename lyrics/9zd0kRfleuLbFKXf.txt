I bled my [?] wounds
Just place your sweet shackles on my mind
I'm down to white notions of waiting slow
No mercy, no pardon for stolen time

When the gravel hit the stand
I'm damned of loving you
Two palm trees in the sand
I'm damned of loving you
We set fire to these skies for our love and I'd do it all again
I'm damned to loving you

Crush the stars now there's no escape
Cause your walls are my favorite vice
Too harsh committed to hopeless fate
I'd serve my life sentence a thousand times, woman

When the gravel hit the stand
I'm damned of loving you
Two palm trees in the sand
I'm damned of loving you
We set fire to these skies for our love and I'd do it all again
Cause I'm damned to loving you

When the gravel hit the stand
I'm damned of loving you
Two palm trees in the sand
I'm damned of loving you
We set fire to these skies for our love and I'd do it all again
I'm damned of loving you

Like you own my love In every life before
And every life I live, all my love searching for
It's like you own my love In every life before
And every life I live, all my love searching for

When the gravel hit the stand
I'm damned of loving you
Two palm trees in the sand
I'm damned of loving you
We set fire to these skies for our love and I'd do it all again
Cause I'm damned of loving you

When the gravel hit the stand
(Just like it's always been)
I'm damned of loving you
Two palm trees in the sand
(Can't get away from it)
I'm damned of loving you
We set fire to these skies for our love and I'd do it all again
Cause I'm damned to loving you
I'm damned of loving
