With nothing better to do
No one to come home to
I woefully conclude
To take it out on you

I'm bored to the extreme
This world of foolish dreams
Disillusion
I am not who I seem to be
Yeah sure I might do harm
And bear my right to arm
Retribution
If only someone would listen to me
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me

A room, an empty shelf
A book on mental health
I look for inner wealth
By punishing myself

I'm bored to the extreme
This world of foolish dreams
Disillusion
I am not who I seem to be
Yeah sure I might do harm
And bear my right to arm
Retribution
If only someone would listen to me
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me
