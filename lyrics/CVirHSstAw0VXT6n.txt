Oh yeah (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Oh yeah (oh yeah, oh yeah)

So tell me who am I supposed to be?
What I gotta do to get you close to me?
If I run away tonight will you follow me?
Come on, come on, come on (oh yeah)

I see you standing there all alone (all alone)
Knowing you've been wanting me to say hello
'Cause when the lights go flashing everybody knows
It's on, it's on, it's on (hey)

Say anything you want, I turn the music up
'Cause baby we ain't going no-oh-oh-where
I'll leave it all behind to be with you tonight
And everybody's screaming, "oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah"

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Is screaming oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Is screaming oh yeah
Oh yeah,oh yeah
Is screaming oh yeah, yeah

And now it's time I gotta make a move
We could be together if you only knew (only knew)
'Cause life's too short, and we got nothing to lose
Come on, come on, come on (oh yeah)

I can't seem to get you out my mind (oh, no)
And I ain't gonna stop until I make you mine (make you mine)
I just gotta make it to you by the end of the night
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh

Say anything you want, I turn the music up
'Cause baby we ain't going no-oh-oh-where
I'll leave it all behind to be with you tonight
And everybody's screaming, "oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah"

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Is screaming oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Is screaming oh yeah
Oh yeah,oh yeah
Is screaming oh yeah, yeah

I know the night is ending
And time just keeps on running out
I gotta find my way to
Oh yeah

Say anything you want (say anything)
I turn the music up
'Cause baby we ain't going no-oh-oh-where (we ain't going nowhere)
I'll leave it all behind to be with you tonight (come on)
And everybody's screaming, "oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah"

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Is screaming oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Is screaming oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Is screaming oh yeah

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Come on

Oh yeah, oh yeah
I wanna hear you say
Oh yeah, oh yeah
