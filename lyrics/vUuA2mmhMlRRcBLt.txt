Used to be original
But now I tremble in fear
I am like everyone else
And that buries me

Is this how it feels to reach rock bottom?
Want to know how it feels to be forgotten

I've become the distant
I am the sober and irrelevant
I don't feel a part in this
What is there to believe?

I'm not asking for much
Just a moment
A chance to pick up the pieces
Happiness, please come home

What if it ends right here?
How do I change this?
Hoping to find a savior
I've lost my way

I've become the distant
I am the sober and irrelevant
I don't feel a part in this
What is there to believe?

Is this how it feels to reach rock bottom?

I don't feel a part in this
What is there to believe?
