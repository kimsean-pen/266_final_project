"This is what I can believe"
Is what I said to my friend
"And I can recall

"I must have been pretty gone
When I went through these towns
Like a cannonball

"And I've already grown up here
Here I might as well grow down
It's all shaky, built in fury,
But I think this wind's going to settle down

"Carolina, why are we going with this around?
It's all silvery, dear, it's the light of little nowhere towns

"But the treasure we had was so big
And we sunk through the earth
And believe how slow

"Sun wasn't out for all week
And the weekend just said
There's just none to show

"And I barely can remember
Little feet on solid ground
The drinking part is useless
When you're buried away from sounds

"Carolina, where are you ending up this time?
Say it's silvery, dear, like the light of little nowhere towns

"But now honestly I'm broken down
By this emptiness I feel
First you moan, and then you yell it
And now we don't answer across the street

"And I'm racing through my pockets now
Because I'm starting to believe
That selling emptiness to strangers
Is a little bit warmer than my dreams

"This is what I should believe"
Is what I said to my friend
"And I can recall

I must have been pretty cold
When I went through this house
Like a cannonball

And I barely can remember
Asking you through all this time
It's all shaky, built in fury
Like this wind is going to settle down

"Carolina, where are we going to be found?
You're all silvery, dear, you're the light of little nowhere towns"
