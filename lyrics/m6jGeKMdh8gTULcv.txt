Signs of contemptible times
You still dance with an arm to your side?
Our hands to be empty and still
Asleep on the windowsill if it be your will

Is last winter's prize winning Norwegian Forest outside?
Could I try on your lilac dress?
Wendy band you know the rest

So I take from your stare
You've got a lesson in there?
Well they say the Institute made
A perfected replica blade for the Ancient of Days

While you dial the priest I'll tell Princess to try the police
We could start the 3rd World War!
But then what good would scripture be for?

An absence of calm in the air as the temperature fell
On the new concierge at the Carriage Hotel
Word has it the younger McKim girl's not well
You remember that story with the mermaid and the actor?
Betsy, the bones of the prophets we saw
The mob throwing stones at the Bethlehem wall
In grandiose tones, raising right paw
In Jacques Louis David Tennis Court Oath gesture

All joking aside, five fingers wide
Should the bed of the bride be despair
Tell your parents it's true
Though I'd never physically hurt you
I do know some Arabic prayers
But I left what was left of my self-respect
Like a Swiss army knife on the ground
And a pocket of coins at the IDF checkpoint
By what some call 'the Temple Mount
