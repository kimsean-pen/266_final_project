Looking through the backyard of my life
Time to sweep the fallen leaves away

Like the sun that rises every day
We can chase the dark clouds from the sky

I gave my promise to you girl, I don't wanna take it back
You and me, side by side
We know how to change the world
That is why, I gave my promise to you girl

Hey why wait another day, that won't get us anywhere
All the time, that ain't changed
To repair this brave old world
We'll be up, I gave my promise to you girl

Every single second of our life
We can use to chase the clouds away

Well, there's no more barking up the tree, no more howling at the moon
Same old scene, you and I
Diving for the deepest trust
That is why, I gave my promise to you girl

Ooh ooh
Looking through the backyard of my life
Time to sweep the fallen leaves away
