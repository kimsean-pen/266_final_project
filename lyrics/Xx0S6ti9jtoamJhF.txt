Oh, I need a whole lot of woman, yeah, to satisfy my soul
It takes a lot woman, yeah, to satisfy my soul

Oh, I need a girl, a sweet little thing
To love me all of the time

You know fire make things hot
And oh, and ice keep 'em cold
But I need a whole lot of woman, yeah, to, to satisfy my soul
It takes a lot woman, to satisfy my soul

Oh and I don't need no woman

You know that fire make things hot
And the ice to keep 'em cold
And I need a whole lot of woman, yeah, to satisfy my soul
It takes a lot woman, yeah, to satisfy my soul

Satisfy, satisfy, I need a woman to satisfy

I need a woman to make me glad, oh, whenever I'm feeling sad
I need a woman to treat me right, and oh to love me both day and night
