I was sittin' on the fence and I thought that I would kiss you
I never thought I would have missed you
But you never let me fall, push my back against the wall
Every time you call, you get so emotional

I'm freaking out

Ring, ring, is that you on the phone?
You think you're clever, but you never saying nothing at all
Hey, hey, the way you spin me around
You make me dizzy when you play me like a kid with a crown

You got a dangerous obsession
Now I'm in need of some protection
That was never my intention

Used to love me, now you hate me
Say I drove you crazy, well, if I did, you made me
Won't somebody save me from you now?

Ring, ring, is that you on the phone?
You think you're clever, but you never saying nothing at all
Hey, hey, the way you spin me around
You make me dizzy when you play me like a kid with a crown

Each word I wanted until you blasted it

Why won't you leave me alone?
Hang up the phone, just let me go

Ring, ring, is that you on the phone?
You think you're clever, but you never saying nothing at all
Hey, hey, the way you spin me around
You make me dizzy when you play me like a kid with a crown

Ring, ring, is that you on the phone?
You think you're clever, but you never saying nothing at all
Hey, hey, the way you spin me around
You make me dizzy when you play me like a kid with a crown

Ring, ring
Ring, ring
Ring, ring
