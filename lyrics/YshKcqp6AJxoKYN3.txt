Stream of cold
Breathing slowly
Tired feet
Pass the ground

Gentle fold
Sun of gold
And blooms of green
And pass it right now
Where you stand right now
I open to
Only you now
I choose thou
I refuse now
Full of glory now
Painful paper
I carry you
I nurture you
Give birth to you
I can
Feel your heart's end
Touch me again
I surrender
I can

Feel like bright
From the inside
Jungle red
Easier felt than said
I'm raising you
You're my greatest ode to you

I carry you
I nurture you
Give birth to you
I can
Feel your heart's end
Touch me again
I surrender
Full of power
I surrender now
I stand up now
I am open to
Only you now
Hide you inside
Hide with you now
Where are you now
Where is my paper

Holding this
In the water
Let it cleanse
What is left of me
I face this
Sorrow
I rise from this

I surrender now
I stand up now
I am open to
Only you...
