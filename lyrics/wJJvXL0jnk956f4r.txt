Was it odd enough for her to live with me this way?
I'm sleeping all the time and everything seems fake
Cause their pills they go away then I can't seem to face
This life when I'm awake
I'll hold my breath one more time
Just to see if anyone will come
And scare me half to death 'cause I need to feel alive again
I've been waiting, I've been praying for you
I've lost the will, I can't pretend
To see the light I'll never see again
I'm praying for you
They said they'd help me find a way
Just take three times a day discontinue if I faint
Were you there when I needed you?
Were you around for me?
Should I make believe that I'm really okay and
So scare me half to death 'cause I need to feel alive again
I've been waiting, I've been praying for you
I've lost the will, I can't pretend
To see the light I'll never see again
I'm praying for you
