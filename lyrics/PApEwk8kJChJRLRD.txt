I've lost everything.
Does holding on to hope still make me weak?
I'm guilty of this,
I know it's a flaw.
I can't find the words to sing to save us all.

Somebody please tell me where to go
when nobody wants me to come back home.
I sold my soul to this open road.
Room full of friends and I'm all alone.
But if I don't try then I'll never know.
Starve the ego to feed the soul.
So if I put everything that I have in this,
how can I let it go?

Look into my eyes.
You said I'd never make it anyways.
I hope you think about me while you're lying awake,
and I'll be holding on to this like it's all that I have.

I remember when it hurt when I spoke out loud,
sour taste in the back of my mouth.
Now there's passion where there once was doubt.
I've seen the bottom and a sold out crowd.
Yeah, so I put everything that I had in this,
me and everyone I travel with
and made something real out of Dangerkids
and I'm grateful for every bit.

They love who you are but they want you to change,
over and over, it's always the same.
They'll fill you with doubt until you believe what they say,
but one day you'll tell them...

Look into my eyes.
You said I'd never make it anyways.
I hope you think about me while you're lying awake,
and I'll be holding on to this like it's all that I have.
Look into my eyes.
You said they'd never listen anyways,
now they sing along to all the songs that you hate,
and I'll be holding on to this like it's all that I have

I've lost everything,
and to think I gave a fuck what you say about me.
Push into it all,
fight until I fall,
even if I have to crawl my way out, I will.

Even if I have to crawl my way out.
