Spirit divide: Consume, decry.
reality folds. one mind is many.
Peripheral confusion, human pain.
Abdominal spray. blank space.
stars crumble in disarray.
Gorge of bees and hornets yawning.
Monstrous ravenous desire.
blade bends inward steadfast.
bonds shatter twisting freely.
dead human orifice calling:
"Spirit divide: consume decry."
Who stands under thy shattered knife?
"Spirit divide. Consume decry."
Who dares still stand under thy knife?

Blank space.
