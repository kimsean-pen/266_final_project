Embrace me
My sweet embraceable you
Embrace me
My irreplaceable you
Just one look at you
My heart grows tipsy in me
You and you alone
Brings out the gypsy in me

I love all
The many charms about you
Above all
I want my arms about you
Don't be naughty naugthy naughty baby
Come to mama
Come to mama do
My sweet embraceable you

I love all
The many charms about you
Above all
I want my arms about you
Dont be naughty baby
Come to mama
Come to mama do
My sweet embraceable you
