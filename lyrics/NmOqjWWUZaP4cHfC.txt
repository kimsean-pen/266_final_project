I've been changin', but you'll never see me now
I've been changin', but you'll never see me now
Now I'm blaming you for everything

No more holding it in
How many years can I pretend
And nothing ever goes the way it should

No more sitting in this place
Hoping you might see it my way
'Cause I don't think you ever understood
That what I'm looking for are the answers
To why these questions never go away

I'm so far away
I've been changin', but you'll never see me now
(I'm so far away)
Now I'm blaming you for everything

No more waiting for the end
Of everyday that I will spend
Wishing that I only had a choice

No more pushing it away
'Cause I'll be busy watching things go my way
Never looking back on this anymore
'Cause what I'm looking for are the answers
To why these questions never go away

I'm so far away
I've been changin', but you'll never see me now
(I'm so far away)
Now I'm blaming you for everything

I've been changin', but you'll never see me now
Now I'm blaming you for
Everything!

I'm so far away!

Hey, hey, watch me wave
Goodbye to yesterday
Nothing left in my way

Hey, hey, I've been saved
With sun shining on my pain
Getting me through this day
Hey, hey, watch me wave
Goodbye to yesterday
Nothing left in my way
Feels so good to say...
I'm so far away
I've been changin', but you'll never see me now
(I'm so far away)
Now I'm blaming you...
I'm so far away!
