Locked inside your head
Do you realize the things you said
Never made sense?

We can sit here and laugh
But we don't know the half of it
In your defense

We've been talking a while
And it seems to me each time you smile
Lights are coming on

But they don't burn too strong
And they won't stay for long
And then they're gone again

Funnyman
Gotta plan for the something wonderful
Funnyman
Listening to the world turning on itself

Tuning into a brand new universe
Funnyman
You'll never be anything else

Do you remember the night
When I had to play your angel
Saving your soul?

Even though you were holding on tight
Part of you was taken
By your demons below

And with no one to lose
You said you feel like a bruise
On a beautiful body

And all the damage you do
It is so honest and true
I don't wanna feel sorry for you

Funnyman
Gotta plan for the something wonderful
Funnyman
Listening to the world turning on itself

Tuning into a brand new universe
Funnyman
You'll never be anything else
