I take a step outside
And I breathe the air
And I slam the door
And I'm on my way
I won't lay no blame
I won't call your names
'Cause I've made my break
And I won't look back
I've turned my back
On those endless games

I'm all through with ties
I'm all tired of tears
I'm a happy man
Don't it look that way?
Shaking dust from my shoes
There's a road ahead
And there's no way back home
Oh, but I have to say
Leaving home ain't easy
Oh, I never thought it would be easy
Leaving on your own
Oh, is the main thing calling me back?

Leaving home ain't easy

On the one, you're leaving home

Stay, my love, my love, please, stay
Stay, my love, what's wrong, my love?
What's right, my love?
Oh, leaving home ain't easy
I thought how could I think of leaving
Leaving on your own
Still trying to persuade me that
Leaving home ain't necessary
Leave the only way
Leaving home ain't easy
But maybe the only way
