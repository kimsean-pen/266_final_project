We'll drink horse bark root beer
and sit on your back stairs
and I'll whisper in your hair
in the summer air
in the summer air
And the sweat will roll down our backs
and we'll follow animal tracks
to a tree in the woods
and a hole in the leaves we'll see
the bright baby eyes of a chickadee
how will I know
how will I know
how will I know
how will I know
And the sweat will roll down our backs
and we'll follow animal tracks
to a tree in the woods
and a hole in the leaves we'll see
the bright baby eyes of a chickadee
the bright baby eyes of a chickadee
