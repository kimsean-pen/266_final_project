Everybody knows you've been steppin' on my toes
And I'm gettin' pretty tired of it
You keep a steppin' out of line and messin' with my mind
If you had any sense you'd quit

'Cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl
You said I was the only man in this whole world
Now, you better do some thinkin', then you'll find
You got the only daddy that'll walk the line

I keep a workin' every day, all you want to do is play
I'm tired of stayin' out all night
I'm comin' unglued from your funny little moods
Now honey baby, that ain't right

'Cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl
You said I was the only man in this whole world
Now, you better do some thinkin', then you'll find
You got the only daddy that'll walk the line

You keep a packin' up my clothes, nearly everybody knows
That you're still just a puttin' me on
When I start a walkin', gonna hear you start a squawkin'
And beggin' me to come back home

'Cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl
You said I was the only man in this whole world
Now, you better do some thinkin', then you'll find
You got the only daddy that'll walk the line
You got the only daddy that'll walk the line
