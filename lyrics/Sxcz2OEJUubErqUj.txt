When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
Then I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
'Till I get to the bottom
Where I see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well do you or don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me. tell me
Come on tell me the answer
Well you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Look out!
Helter Skelter
Helter Skelter
Helter Skelter

Well do you or don't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Baby tell me the answer
Well you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Look out!
Helter Skelter
Helter Skelter
Helter Skelter

When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
Then I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
'Till I get to the bottom
When I see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
