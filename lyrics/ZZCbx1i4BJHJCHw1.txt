Is this the place that I want to be?
Is it you I want to see?
Holding on, hold it high, show me everything
And you're leaving me, yeah you're leaving me
You're leaving me with a hated identity

But I keep on a-comin' here and standing in this state
And I'm never really sure if you'll take what I'm saying the right way
But I'm not appalled or afraid verbal pocket play
Is as discreet as I can muster up to be
Because the Cadillac that's sittin' in the back
It isn't me
Oh, no, no, no it isn't me
I'm more at home in my galaxie

Can I do the things I wanna do
That I don't do because of you?
And I'll take a left and I'll second guess
Into a total mess
And you're leaving me, yeah you're leaving me
You're leaving me with a hated identity

But I keep on a-comin' here and standing in this state
Oh and I'm always reassured the situation's getting carried away
But I'm not appalled or afraid verbal pocket play
Is as discreet as I can muster up to be
Because the Cadillac that's sittin' in the back
It isn't me
Oh, no, no, no it isn't me

Oh, no, no, no it isn't me
No it isn't me
No it isn't me
No it isn't me
No, no it isn't me
No it isn't me
In my galaxie
