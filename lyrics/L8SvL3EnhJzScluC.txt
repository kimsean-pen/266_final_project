It's been a long time running
Because I had some things to see
I had to meet some people
Who were there to believe in me
I'm taking all that struggle
Reminds me what I'm fighting for
I'm living it up
I ain't gonna stop
Till I make that final score
And I'll keep running
As fast as I can
I'll keep running
I won't stop
I won't stop
No no
Hey now
If you push me down I'll get up again
Hey now
If you let me drown
I'll swim like a champion
I'm sure
There'll be good times
There'll be bad times
But I don't care
'Cause I'm running on air
Give me a million reasons
But my answer stays the same
You can try to put me in a box
But I'm doing in my own damn way
See I can stand them talkers
All pretending that their lives' a mess
'Cause whatever you want
Whatever you need
You gotta get off your
And I'll keep running
As fast as I can
I'll keep running
I won't stop
I won't stop
Hey now
If you push me down I'll get up again
Hey now
If you let me drown
I'll swim like a champion
I'm sure
There'll be good times
There'll be bad times
But I don't care
'Cause I'm running on air
hey I'm running on air
Running, running on air
Running, running
Now I don't care
Hey now
If you push me down I'll get up again
Hey now, hey now
You can push me, push me down
Hey now
but I'll get up again
I'm sure
There'll be good times
There'll be bad times
But I don't care
'Cause I'm running on air
