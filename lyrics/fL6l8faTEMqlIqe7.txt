Yeah!
Lord, I feel the ocean swaying me
Washing away all my pain
See where I used to be wounded
Remember the scars, now you can't see a thing
And I don't feel no pain oh no
Hey!
Singing about the Valley of Sunrise
Green and blue canyons too
I'm singing about Atlantis love songs
Valleys of Neptune is rising, rising, rising

Mercury liquid and emeralds shining
They're showing me where I came from baby
Honey sun turquoise bed he lays on
On the burning edge horizon
I'm sailing on a bluebird's mission
Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam
See the wind make love to all the ocean
And the waves spread the message got home
And the message got home
Hey yeah!
I'm singing about Atlantis love songs
Egypt moon trips flying flying
Playing about the valleys of autumn
Valleys of Neptune is rising rising
Valleys of Neptune is rising rising

Valleys of Neptune
guitar - rock on baby rock, oo oo oo, ri-i-ise, rise baby now

Lookout East coast, you're going to have a neighbor
Rebirth land home of the praying sands
We know there were three continents so much older
And they shall rise and tell us much more the truth of man
I see visions of sleeping peaks erupting
Releasing all hell that will shake the Earth from end to end
And this ain't good news, bad news, or any news
It's just the truth
Better save your souls while you can
