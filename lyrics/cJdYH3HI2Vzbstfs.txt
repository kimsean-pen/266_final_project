Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes...
Hybrid
I've been digging in crates
Ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology, big band theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic to so I can start blessing it
Chin-checkin? kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic chords like double helixes
To show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumetalists
and all of you MC's that Hate us.
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones
I firebomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this
High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
Akira
I've put a kink in the backbones, of clones, with microphones
Never satisfied my rhyme Jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood types Crylon, Technicolor type A
On highways write with road rage
On pages of wind, and cages a tin, that bounce all around
Surround sound devouring the scenes
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things
Sing songs karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics
Forth dimension, compact convention
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away, with the pencil
Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile
While you risk your all
I pick out at your flaws
Singing rah blah, blah, blah you can say you saw
High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
Who's the man, the man in your hand over your land
Roving over man's bolding when he's jamming your plans ova
I am vics clorousos, the most ferocious
When I spy my third eye, it's extremely high voltage
That's why I need ruby corks glasses
Cause when I glance at the chest
Then I might blast the masses
Subliminals transmitted through piano
Integrated in flow, calculated to nano
My IU skills are when I mean plea
Sees the rhyme I hear as I proceed through time
I walk through the walls and the inanimate obstacles
While educed to the reduction of cells and molecules
I bring the knowledge the you swallow like the state of hologram
I bot your head, fat your lip like collagen
A telepath of the another verse with no postage
Pharoahe Monch, Mike Shinoda, we are high voltage
High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking' you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
