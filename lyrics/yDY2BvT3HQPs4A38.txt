For once I missed a plea
I have said too much in memory
I don't know why
I'm forever learning

Why be so decieving
When it's all to no avail
I could take you serious again
Even though you find it all so devious, again
I know you will
I've tried to warn you
I've tried to tell you
But it's all to no avail

You've got me all of a tremble
If it takes a thousand years
Then I must try to catch her

I could make those promises again
Even though I crucify your attitude again
If I should fail...

If it takes a thousand years
Then I must try
If it takes a million years
Then I must try
To catch her, catch her, catch her...
