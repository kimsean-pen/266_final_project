Ah-Ah: Ah-Ah: Ah-Ah: Ah-Ah

So you're wishing that you never did all the embarrassing things you've done
And you're wishing you could set it right
And you're wishing you could stay the night
But then I go again, wishing never solved the problem
If you wanna get it big time, go ahead and get it, get it big time

Ah-Ah: Ah-Ah: Ah-Ah: Ah-Ah

So I think I can solve all problems by myself
Oh nevermind, nevermind, nevermind, nevermind, nevermind

And you think you can solve all your problems by yourself
Oh nevermind, nevermind, nevermind, nevermind, nevermind

Ah-Ah: Ah-Ah: Ah-Ah: Ah-Ah

I'm gonna give it, give it, give it, give it
Until you just can't get no more
I'm gonna give it, give it, give it, give it
Until you just can't get no more

Oh-Oh: Oh-Oh-Oh: Oh-Oh-Oh: Oh-Oh-Oh

I'm gonna get it, get it, get it, get it
Until you just can't give no more
I'm gonna get it, get it, get it, get it
Until you just can't give no more

Oh-Oh: Oh-Oh-Oh: Oh-Oh-Oh: Oh-Oh-Oh
