You said you'd always be alive, well so will I, I'll always will be with you,
My everlasting hope I'm clinging to.

You said that beauty never dies and memories survive, as long as I'm with you,
No words could mean this much, this much to you.

But dark has fallen, don't ask why.
The clouds have swollen into a grey sky.
