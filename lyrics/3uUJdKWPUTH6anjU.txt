When we turn out the lights
The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
But girl you know that I would never ever let another's touch
Come between the two of us
Cause no one else will ever take your place

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl, to me
And you'll always be, eternally
Everytime I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl with just a touch, you can do so much

No one else comes close

And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder
You're my dream come true
Oh, girl you know I'll always treasure
Every kiss, every day
I love you girl in every way
And I always will cause in my eyes
No one else comes close to you
No one makes me there like when you do
You're so special girl to me
and you'll always be, eternaly
everytime i hold you near
you always say the words i love to hear
girl with just a touch can do so much
no one else comes close to you
no one makes me there like when you do
every time i hold you near
you always say the words i love to hear
girl with just a touch can do so much
no one else comes close

NO ONE ELSE COMES CLOSE

Damn I love you
