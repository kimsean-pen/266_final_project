Try to take 'em and make them sing along
And while you grab 'em, make them feel at home
You're probably keeping a pocket full of change
Coins are flipping, no decisions made
It makes you horny, their widely open throats
Waiting to be fed with whatever you may serve

But with me, it's so hard to be
Nothing gets you better than a cold, cold shaking ground
Waking me, get you wide awake, wake, wake now

You try to tame them and make them all yours
And now the stomach is craving for some more
Your body's sucked in this bottomless hole
The beast is sated, enough of their love
The beast is sated

While we waste away
Nothing gives you cover when it won't stop fading out
Green screen, great letter, white, white, white noise

With me, so hard to be
Nothing gets you better than a cold, cold shaking ground
Waking me, get you wide awake, wake, wake now
