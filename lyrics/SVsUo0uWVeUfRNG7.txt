Every time you speak my name
My name (my name)
My image it just burns away
Away away

Every time you speak my name
My name (my name)
My image it just
It just

It just burns away
Burns away, burns away (burns away)
A way a way a way
Gimme that

I could care less than for your grandiosity
I had to skin the cat for curiosity
I could care less than for your sickening, pompous ways
Every time you speak my name my image burns away

I could care less
I could care less
I could care less
I could care less

Don't you know
Our lives are on trial now
And if we lose
We're going straight to Hell

Don't you know
Our lives are on trial now
And if we lose
We're going straight to Hell

Gimme it

You must excuse me
I'm just really not myself
Woke up today inside
Inside of someone else

I could care less than for your sickening, pompous ways
(Gimme that)
Every time you speak my name my image burns away
(Gimme that)

I could care less
I could care less
I could care less(gimme that)
I could care less
I could care less

Don't you know
Our lives are on trial now
And if we lose
We're going straight to Hell

Don't you know
Our lives are on trial now
And if we lose
We're going straight to Hell

Straight to Hell
Straight to Hell
Straight to Hell

Straight to Hell
Straight to Hell
Might go straight to Hell

I could care less
Straight to Hell
I could care less

Straight to Hell
I could care less
Straight to Hell.
