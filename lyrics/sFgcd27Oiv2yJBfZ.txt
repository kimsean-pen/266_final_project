Cherry stem in her mouth, she could tie in a knot
Favorite trick she does, one of ten that she's got
Makin' friends, setting trends, hardly having to try
All the looks by the book, best that money can buy

Look what your money bought
It's all that she's got
Ooh it keeps her company
Straight from Mom and Daddy

Last chance to dance out in back of the bar
Shakin' hands, nice to meet you, I don't know who you are
She has a toke and makes a joke about the alley man
Never pleasured from the treasure in a garbage can

Look what your money bought
It's all that she's got
Ooh it keeps her company
Straight from Mom and Daddy

Look what your money bought
It's all that she's got
Ooh it keeps her company
Straight from Mom and Daddy

Cherry stem in her mouth, she could tie in a knot
Favorite trick she does, one of ten that she's got
Makin' friends, settin' trends, hardly havin' to try
All the looks by the book, best that money can buy

Look what your money bought
It's all that she's got
Ooh it keeps her company
Straight from mom and daddy
