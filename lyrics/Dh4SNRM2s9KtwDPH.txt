(It's a west-side celebration)
(No doubt about us, then you freaky, freaky yeah)

You know the funk will linger
All these motherfuckers wanna smell my finger
All these motherfuckers wanna fuck my singers
I don't give a damn nigga, Jerry Springer
California love, California blood
Long as I got it I don't give a fuck
It's the hypnotic, I'm the narcotic
So if you're spotted actin' robotic
Freeze just like a mannequin
And then start panicking
I'm too hard for you
They still wanna feed you like barbecue
Freaks on the flow, freaks on the flow
How many of y'all freaks on the low?
Freaks on the flow, freaks on the flow
How many of y'all freaks on the low?
