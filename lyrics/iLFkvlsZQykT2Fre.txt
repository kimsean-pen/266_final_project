When the king comes down to speak
With animals
Animals...

With his claws out for a feast
A cannibal
Cannibal...

When we crawl out to the brink
To meet and greet
With a wink...

Pull the rug out from underneath
This cannibal
Cannibal...

Who is gonna break the ice
No room for shallow alibis
Who will be the first to bite
Or do we keep on playing nice
Until the next time...

Hey
It's too late
I've been here before the change
This latest phase...

If the king bows to our feet
A cannibal's
A cannibal...
Who is gonna break the ice
No room for shallow alibis
Who will be the first to bite
Or do we keep on playing nice
Until the next time...
