I can't hold you down, if you want to fly
Can't you see I'm all broke up inside?
Well, just you use your two X Ray eyes

Hurt like Kryptonite, put me on my knees
Now that I've found out just what you're doing
With your secret identities

That's really super, Supergirl
How you saved yourself in seconds flat
And your friends are going to say

"That's really super, Supergirl"
How you're changing all the world's weather
But you couldn't put us back together

Now I feel like I'm tethered deep
Inside your fortress of solitude
Don't mean to be rude
But I don't feel super, Supergirl

I won't call again, even in a jam
Now I realize you could be on a mission
Saving some other man

That's really super, Supergirl
How you saved yourself in seconds flat
And your friends are going to say

"That's really super Supergirl"
How you stopped the universe from dying
But you're never going to stop me crying

And I feel like you're trying hard
To sweep me like dirt underneath your cape
Well I might be an ape
But I used to feel super, Supergirl

That's really super, Supergirl
How you saved yourself in seconds flat
And your friends are going to say

"That's really super Supergirl"
How you're changing the world's weather
But you couldn't put us back together

Super, Supergirl
How you stopped the universe from dying
But you're never going to stop me crying

Super, Supergirl
I'm here in your fortress of solitude
Don't mean to be rude but I don't feel super
