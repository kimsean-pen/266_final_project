I feel you pushing me forward
To the place I wanna go
There is no melody sweeter
Something I've never known
S'why I like you around
'Cause you make me feel good
S'why I like you around
'Cause you make me feel good
Yeah, you make me feel good
Yeah, you make me feel good
Yeah, you make me feel good
Yeah, you make me feel good
I feel you pushing me forward
To the place I wanna go
There is no melody sweeter
Something I've never known
I wanna be there for you
Like you're always there for me
It took a little bit to figure it out
And now I can finally see
S'why I like you around
'Cause you make me feel good
S'why I like you around
'Cause you make me feel good
Yeah, you make me feel good
Yeah, you make me feel good
Yeah, you make me feel good
Yeah, you make me feel good
I want to be the one for you
I hope I make you feel it too
You feel it too the way that I do
S'why I like you around
'Cause you make me feel good
S'why I like you around
'Cause you make me feel good
Yeah, you make me feel good
Yeah, you make me feel good
Yeah, you make me feel good
Yeah, you make me feel good
Yeah, you make me feel good

Yeah, you make me feel good
S'why I like you around
Yeah, you make me feel good
