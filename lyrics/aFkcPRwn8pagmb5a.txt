Smashing through the boundaries
Storming through the burning fields
Stand before the evil one, on towards the morning sun
Falling under skies of pain

Still we're searching endlessly
Crashing over seven seas
Torturing the winter sky, riding over plains of ice
Shadows in the fields of the slain

Crashing steel and raging fury
Smash the quest, destroy their army
Crush the legions of the twilight

Templars of steel will burn
Cry far away, as we reach for the day
Blasting our way through the punishment and the pain

Reach for the world, as the sky begins to fall
Rising through the darkened ashes praying that I'll see you all
Far away, will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away, the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside

The chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts that stand for all our li-i-ives

Live tonight
Woahooaaaaoooh!
Woahooaaaaoooaaaoooh!
Watch you die I watch you die inside
Fear controls your life
And reject this animosity
That kills so many minds
You feel the power deep within

The fear you hold inside
Just to find the reason for the treason
Now you will be mine

Screams of pain in death descending
Rise again from hell defending
Burn their heart within the fire
Warriors of light will be slain

Rise through the pain, like the sun will rise again
Day after day but the memories never change
Stand before the storm, as the last horizon falls
Blinded by the vision and the innocence of our souls
Far away, will our eyes now see the day

For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away, the dreams of a brighter day

Forever hold the dream inside
The chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts that stand for all our li-i-ives
Live tonight
Far away, will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Far away, will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away, the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside
The chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts that stand for all our li-i-ives
Live tonight
