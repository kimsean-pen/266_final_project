It's Gucci
Fifth Harmony
I need somebody with some patience
'Cause you know I got a temperament
And yeah, you got a reputation
Nothin' that a little love can't fix
There ain't no kinda situation
Where I wouldn't cross a line for you
FBI interrogation
I would get up there and lie for you
When push come to shove
You show me love
When push come to shove, aye
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you
You the type that I could bake for (bake for)
'Cause baby, you know how to take that cake
And I'm the only one you wait for
'Cause baby, you know that I'm worth the wait
When push come to shove
You show7tuhAjl
