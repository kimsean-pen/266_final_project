I woke up in LA
I hella' miss the bay
But I can't go
Can't go home
Cause' the boy of my dreams
Took everything from me
He took everything i own
I'm hungover and abandoned
Never believe would happen
I almost cared
Now I'm layin' here lookin' for the words to say
But there is nothing left
Throw it up watch it fall down slow
Sold my heart don't know where to go
I came to see you to say hello
Well you're wasted and now I know

My love
Can you feel my pain
Cause' you were the poison in my veins

My love
Can you hear me screaming
Cause' I am still bleeding from the day you left me

(Day U Left Me)

(Day U Left Me)

(Day U Left Me)

(Day U Left Me)

(Day U Left Me)

(Day U Left Me)

(Day U Left Me)

(Day U Left Me)

Ohhh, no no

You spent the night in my bed
The next day you put a gun to my head
Pill botttles and broken cassettes
Lord help me I'm tryna' forget
Cause' when I hear your name I get nervous
And I know that you were doin' this on purpose
And I know that you find this funny
And I know that you just want my money
My money
Noooo, oh no
Throw it up watch it fall down slow
You bought my heart and you won't let go
I came to see you to say hello
While I'm wasted and now you know

My love
Can you feel my pain
Cause' you were the poison in my veins

My love
Can you hear me screaming
Cause' I am still bleeding from the day you left me

(Day U Left Me)

(Day U Left Me)

(Day U Left Me)

(Day U Left Me)

(Day U Left Me)

(Day U Left Me)

(Day U Left Me)

(Day U Left Me)

Ohhhh ohhhh no no,

End
