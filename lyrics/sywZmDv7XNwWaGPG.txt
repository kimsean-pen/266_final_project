I heard a puff, I heard a blow
I felt the ground, I felt the snow
I thought of linen and of lace
I never really saw his face

I heard a grunt, I heard a moan
I felt the sun, I saw the moon
I saw the northern light above
And the eclipse of the sun

I am a breath, I am a wish
I am a rocket and a fish
I felt his measures and his weight
My own body as a scale

I heard a whisper in my ear
"You are not here, you are not here"
I saw the northern light above
And the eclipse of the sun

My feet was hurt and heals were sore
And I wondered why it burned
And I wondered why it burned

Then I had to climb down
I went down to see the sun rise
And then I had to climb back up again
I had to be there to see the sun rise

All the air that you sent to guide me
Had a tone of the elephant gray
We were all there in the morning
We were there and we wanted to stay

So quite a lot of what people had heard was right
Some was wrong
