If the aliens came down today
What would they think? What would they say?
Would they like what we've done with the place?
Would they tell us the secrets of the human race?
What is a war? Why does it start?
Why build a planet just to tear it apart?
If the aliens came down to earth today

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

If the aliens came down to earth
Would they take a look around and wonder what it's worth?
Would they never give a thought to what money can buy
And give a helping hand and not ask why?
What is the meaning of this life that we live?
What good is taking when its so good to give?
If the aliens came down to earth today

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

If the aliens came down tonight
Would they wanna be friends? Would they wanna fight?
Would they cut us apart and take a look inside
And just see the guts or would they really find
The same beating heart inside you and me?
Maybe they could teach us to live peacefully
If the aliens came down to earth today

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

If the aliens came down from space
Would they beam me up and take me away from this place
Maybe their galaxy would feel like home
Maybe up there I wouldn't feel alone
Maybe I'm dreaming but that's what I do
Maybe there's no aliens just me and you
If the aliens came down to earth today
