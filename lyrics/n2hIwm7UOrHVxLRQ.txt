Coming outside, I got a place we can hide
Nobody knows, I just wanna feel alright
Started again, I don't wanna have to do ten
I'll stay outside till your back again 2x
Ooo 2x

How do I know, this was the right way to go
If she says bye, I don't feel alright
Started again, I don't wanna have to do ten
I'll stay inside till your back again 2x
Ooo 4x

Don't say that you think that they know 8x
Ooo 6x
