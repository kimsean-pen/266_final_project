I should pray a little more and think a little less
The devil's in my head and he won't let me rest
Everyday just like the last since you up and left
I should pray a little more, I shouldn't pray for death

Get out my head girl, I'm already over you
I'm just sitting waiting for my body to figure it out
If you hit me up to come over I'm down

I know in my heart, you don't need me, I'd still hit you back
Cause I'm dying without your attention
Without you I'm lost

No, no, no
I can't feel you when you kiss me

And you insist you don't understand
Well you can choke on every single word you ever said
I put you out, you're just gonna kill
I'm so close to spilling blood all over your bed

I should wait a little more and calm you up in ten
Spin me in your web and let me go again
I saw you up in your bed & not a minute since
I should pray a little more, I shouldn't pray for death

Get out my head girl, I'm already over you
I'm just sitting waiting for my body to figure it out
If you hit me up to come over I'm down

I know in my heart, you don't need me, I'd still hit you back
Cause I'm dying without your attention
Without you I'm lost

No, no, no
I can't feel you when you kiss me
No, no, no
I feel so cold whem you're not with me

And you insist you don't understand
Well you can choke on every single word you ever said
I put you out, you're just gonna kill
I'm so close to spilling blood all over your bed

Am I just a slave? Am I going to waste?
I am not the same, I can only feel pain
Cause I'm a mess and you don't exist
Unil you need to use my body, tear my heart to shreds

And you insist you don't understand
And you insist you don't understand
And you insist you don't understand

And you insist you don't understand
Well you can choke on every fucking word you ever said
I put you out, you're just gonna kill
I'm so close to spilling blood all over your bed

Am I just a slave? Am I going to waste?
I am not the same, I can only feel pain
Cause I'm a mess and you don't exist
Unil you need to use my body, tear my heart to shreds
