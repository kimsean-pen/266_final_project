Everybody likes a fiesta
Everybody wants to have fun
Bring a couple of friends and I'll betcha
They'll be hooking up with someone

Cause I'm tired of all the boys who don't like to dance
And if you don't like to dance, you don't stand a chance
So why you standing in the corner, with your arms all folded
When you know, that she's ready to dance, right up on ya

You got the money, money
She's got the hottie, body
We wanna party, party
It all up!
You pick the song they're playing
She waits anticipating
All the while the DJ's saying
It on up

Get up
If you think you can just stand around, you're dreaming
It's gonna take a little bit more
To have a chance with me is a good reason
To mix it up right on the dance floor

Hell no
We don't dance
Less we, don't stand a chance
Then we, pull up our pants,
And hit the dance floor baby, so

If you wanna chance, better
Get up and dance
Let your, hair really dance
In that case, stay at home, players only

You got the money, money
She's got the hottie, body
We wanna party, party
It all up

You pick the song they're playing
She waits anticipating
All the while the DJ's saying
It on up!

Beat is dropping
There's no stopping
What could happen here tonight
So
It up with my friends,
I'll hook you up with her friend
No one's gonna feel alone tonight
You got the money, money
She's got the hottie, body
We wanna party, party
It on up

You pick the song they're playing
She waits anticipating
All the while the DJ's saying
It on up!
You got the money, money
She's got the hottie, body
We wanna party, party
It on up

You pick the song they're playing
She waits anticipating
All the while the DJ's saying
It on up
