I'm politickin' with this chick and wonderin' if I'ma creep her
Little hoodrat bitch from 25th named Tenika
Comin' through, like I do, you know
Gettin' my bark on

Knew she was a thug because when I met her she had a scarf on
54 11, size 7 in girls
Babyface, would look like she was 11 with curls
Girlfriend, what? Remember me, from way back, I'm the same cat

With the wave cap the motherfucker that TNT used to blaze at
Still here so it's all good, oh you know my niggas Rich
And them doin' they thin' on 35th Damn, it's a small hood
And it's all wood, so let me get that number, I get up, aight

Hit you on da track later on, see wassup, talkin' to shorty made me
Wanna do somethin' nice, lookin' at that ass made me, wanna do
Somethin' tonight and I know right when I see right, shorty lookin' like
She tight, she bite, let her give a nigga the green light, we might

Offer nothin', 'cuz I got you, must you front?
I see you with your, baby, father but it don't matter
Since you gave me the pussy, that ass is gettin' fatter

Let that nigga play daddy, make moves with me
I done kept it more than real boo, can't lose with me
Heard he smacked you 'cuz you said my name while y'all was sexin'
Ran up on this cat, thought was me and started flexin'

You know I ain't even with that, so he gon' have to get that
Just on TP, try to creep me, what? Leave that nigga sleepy
On the strength of you, that's your kid's daddy
I ain't gon' send him on his way, put him up in that big caddy

But let him know, never mind yo, I need you to go
Take this snow up to 150, see Joe, get that, come back with that
We can split that, sit back
Fuck, puff a L, forget that, you wit dat?

Aiyo, this chicken got me diggin' her moves, 'cuz she smooth
Win or lose, whoever she choose, it's the dues
Respect is not expected but it's given 'cuz it's real
Bein' neglected the norm, expect it, the deal

Lie, cheat and steal for me
Puttin' somethin' in a nigga's wig if you squeal for me
Kill for me, you still with me
'Cuz we get down like what

Told you from the door, it ain't all about a nutt
I'm gon' be fair, try to be there
We gon' see then, hit me with the question boo
That answer gon' be yeah

See there, somethin' can go wrong, it does, love'd it, let it go, but it
Came back, that's how strong it was, but you belonged to 'cuz couldn't Belong to me, you had 2 kids by this nigga, it was wrong for me
But we gon' always be, best of friends, haa, mad love, boo, to the end, haa
