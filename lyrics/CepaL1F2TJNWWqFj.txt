Well, I'm tired of losing
I used to win every night of the week
Yeah, back when sex and amphetamines
Oh, were the staples of our childhood physique
You used to tell me we'd turn into something
Oh, you said life was much better than this
Yeah, but the closest I've come to perfection
Is when you turned around to steel a kiss

But you never trusted tomorrow
Yeah, baby, is that anyway to live your life?
Well, you love this heart and this six-string, girl ohh
But they've been out of tune
Yeah, for some time

Well you say, oh, I love so many women
Only so many women love driving me wild
Yeah, they say, oh you get lost in complexion and the
Structure of a well placed smile

But luckily, you
Ohh, you never smile
Yeah, ohh you
Oh, you never smile
Oh, and it looks just a little bit better that way to me
Sometimes it does

Ohh, but you know you never trusted tomorrow
Oh baby, that's just a problem of mine
Yeah, I've been thrown around by some bad ones, girl
Ohh and a good one was a new thing this time

Yeah, but you showed me that I
Couldn't be farther
Ohh, from the truth of the problem at hand
Oh, I could never say, baby, tomorrow
Oh, I'll be right there
I'ma be your man
Oooooh
Yeah, oh, I'll be your man
Oh oooooh
(I'm gonna try at least)
(Good luck to us all)
