Finished with my woman
cause she couldn't help me with my mind
people think i'm insane
because i'm frowning all the time
all day long i think of things
but nothing seems to satisfy
thinking i'll lose my mind
if i dont find something to pacify
can you help me? are you for my brain?
oh yeah
i need someone to show me
the things in life that i cant find
i cant see the things that make
true happiness i must be blind
make a joke and i will sigh
and you will laugh and i will cry
happiness i can not feel
and love to me is so unreal
and so as you hear these words
telling you now of my state
i tell you to enjoy life
i wish i could but its too late
