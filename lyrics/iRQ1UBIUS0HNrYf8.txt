Stay here, see come come undone,
Just free my soul and turn me on,
Lay me down and stop the time,
So long now leave the world behind

We got one minute you know there's no other
It's too late we're in it, you're blowin' my cover
Take me to heaven and back in a second,
Light up this fire before you come rushin'
We got one minute you know there's no other,
It's too late we're in it, you're blowing my cover,
Take me to heaven and back in a second
Light up this fire before you come rushin' (Rushin', Rushin' Rushin').

You ain't goin' rough enough!

Dopest Dope you've ever smoked!

I'm like the dopest dope you've ever smoked!

S-stop the time, so long I'll leave the world behind
Get me on the rise, get me, get me on the up and up,
When I thrash and cry, baby, you ain't goin' rough enough,
I'm your kitty girl and your back is like my scratchin' post,
C'mon make me scream like I, like I, like I seen a ghost!

Drink up I'm soaked
I'm like the dopest dope you ever smoked
These feelings you evoke I only need one, one, one one, need one

Stay here, see come come undone,
Just free my soul and turn me on,
Lay me down and stop the time,
So long now leave the world behind

We got one minute you know there's no other
It's too late we're in it, you're blowin' my cover
Take me to heaven and back in a second,
Light up this fire before you come rushin'

We got one minute you know there's no other,
It's too late we're in it, you're blowing my cover,
Take me to heaven and back in a second
Light up this fire before you come rushin'
(Rushin', Rushin' Rushin').

(You ain't goin', you ain't goin', you ain't goin')
You ain't goin,, You ain't goin' rough enough!

I'm like the dopest dope you've ever smoked!

(We are the only, (Inaudible))
