Standing
On the edge of forever
At the start of whatever
Shouting love at the world

Back then
We were like cavemen
But we mapped the moon and the stars
Then we forgave them

We will meet you where the lights are
The defenders of the faith we are
When the thunder turns around
They'll run so hard we'll tear the ground away

You know no one dies
In these love-drowned eyes
Through our love-drowned eyes
We'll watch you sleep tonight

Although no one understood, we were holding back the flood
Learning how to dance the rain
We were holding back the flood
They said we'd never dance again

Bleeding
But none of us leaving
Watch your mouth, son
Or you'll find yourself floating home

Here we come now on a dark star
Seeing demons, not what we are
Tiny minds and eager hands
Will try to strike but now will end today

There's progress now
Where there once was none,
Where there once was none,
Then everything came along

Although no one understood, we were holding back the flood
Learning how to dance the rain
There was more of them than us
Now they'll never dance again

Although no one understood there was more of them than us
Learning how to dance the rain
We were holding back the flood
They said we'd never dance again

We will meet you where the lights are
The defenders of the faith we are
When the thunder turns around
They'll run so hard we'll tear the ground away

Although no one understood there was more of them than us
Learning how to dance the rain
There was more of them than us
Now they'll never dance again

Now we'll never dance again
