It's not like I'm invisible
You still wear me under your skin
When we talk, we don't talk at all
Too weak to leave, too stubborn to give in
Who is gonna be the first to say a truce
It's not enough that we should part, can't stop fighting too

We don't let go, we can't get close
I still need you when you still need me
This tug of war, can't go on anymore
Nobody wins from this misery
Free...
Well oh can't you see, I wanna be free, I want you to be, free

It's not like she isn't loving you
It's just that you can't be alone for too long
I'd like to wish you all the happiness
Maybe the truth is It'll kill me if you move on
Who is gonna be the first to say enough
Who is gonna be the first one to find true love

We don't let go, we can't get close
I still need you when you still need me
This tug of war, can't go on anymore
Nobody wins from this misery
Free...
Well oh can't you see, I wanna be, I want you to be, free

Let it be, let it be, just a beautiful memory
Anything that starts will have an ending
Let it go, let it go, yeah cause we both know
This will only be over when were, free
Yeah yeah yeah, oh when were free...
Oh oh I know ohh

We don't let go, we can't get close
I still need you when you still need me
This tug of war, can't go on anymore
Nobody wins from this misery
Free...

Well oh can't you see, I wanna be, I want you to be
Whoa, free ahhh, I wanna be, I want ya to be
Oh can't we be, free
Oh I wanna be, free, yeah yeah yeah
