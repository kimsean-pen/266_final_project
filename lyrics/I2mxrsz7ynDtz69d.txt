Silver and gold
And it's growing cold
Autumn leaves
Lay as thick as thieves
Shivers down your spine
Chill you to the bone
Cause the mandolin wind
Is the melody that turns your heart to stone
The heat of your breath
Carving shadows in the mist
Every angel has the wish
That she's never been kissed
A broken dream
Haunting in your sleep
And hiding in your smile
A secret you must keep, love cuts you deep

Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel

There's no scarlet in you
Lay your veil down for me
As sure as god made wine
You can't wrap your arms around a memory
Take warmth from me
Cold autumn wind cut sharp as a knife
And in the dark for me
You're the candle flame that flickers to life

Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love will break the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel

Wise man say
All is fair in love and war
And there's no right or wrong in the design of love
And I could only watch as the wind crushed your wings
Broken and torn
Crushed like a flower under the snow
And like the flower in spring
Love will rise again to heal your wings

Love heals the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love will heal the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love heals the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love will heal the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
