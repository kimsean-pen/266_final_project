There's a lot of nothing in the words I know
but I keep on talking 'cause it feels like home
feels alright to be growing old
but growing old is just letting go
and it's just the reason i needed to leave this place
I took to home owning to run away
I had a different image on my mind
it's just it changes always, all the time

And it comes as no surprise it's like

I just don't know what you're doing
wrong yeah
wrong
man you've got a lot of nerve

I just don't know what you're doing
wrong yeah
wrong oh
man you've got a lot of nerve

How come all my vices always breed relief
but a sip of gin saves an hour of speech?
and yeh it's fickle and it feels so cheap
but I can rest and I can feel at eases
my friends don't know the half they're just listening
I'm at a loss 'cause I'm living it
that's not to say that I'm giving in
it's just that this is how it's always been

And it comes as no surprise it's like
I just don't know what you're doing
wrong yeah
wrong oh
man you've got a lot of nerve

I just don't know what you're doing
wrong yeah
wrong
man you've got a lot of nerve

I can't melt all of my worries to nothing
and I would
I keep trying but i always get let down
somehow
Man you've got a lot of nerve
