Over, over, and again
Over (aah) and again
Over, over, and again
Over (aah)

People talk, but people don't know
You can't make plans, just live as I go
People talk, they don't understand
Love and pain go hand in hand
Ooh, say what they want, I'm still thinking it's worth it
Ooh, little bit drunk, tell my heart you won't hurt it

I love your lies in the dark
Love tearing up a broken heart
Over, over, and again
I love you, now take me home
Love every way you turn me on
Over, over, and again

Over, over, and again
Over (aah) and again
Over, over, and again
Over (aah) and again
Over, over, and again
Over (aah) and again
Over, over, and again
Over (aah) and again

I can't fake I'm in it for you
Good people do bad things too
Say you changed, don't know if I would (nah)
Wanna be yours for real if I could

I love your lies in the dark
Love tearing up a broken heart
Over, over, and again
I love you, now take me home
Love everywhere you turn me on
Over, over, and again

Over, over, and again
Over (aah) and again
Over, over, and again
Over (aah) and again
Over, over, and again
Over (aah) and again
Over, over, and again
Over (aah) and again

Ooh, say what they want, I'm still thinking it's worth it
Ooh, little bit drunk, tell my heart you won't hurt it

Over, over, and again
Over (aah) and again
Over, over, and again
Over (aah) and again
(Over, over, and again)
Love your lies in the dark
(Over, aah, and again)
Love tearing up a broken heart
(Over, over, and again)
(Over, aah, and again)
I love you, now take me home
(Over, over, and again)
Love every way you turn me on
(Over, aah, and again)

Love your lies in the dark
