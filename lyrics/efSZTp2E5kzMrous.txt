It's been a while
How you've come back in style
Singing hey nonny na na na na

Back on the block
Really nothing but talk
Singing hey nonny na na na na
C'mon hey nonny na na na na
C'mon hey nonny na na na na

One two three
Tell her that I just can't go on
Tell her that there's just something wrong
Tell her that I just can't go on
Uh huh

Tell her that I just can't go on
Tell her that there's just something wrong
Tell her that I just can't go on
Uh huh

Back by demand
Do whatever you can
You look older I can tell by your hands
Drinks only gin, says it's how to keep thin
And she's crying after every meal
Lord you don't know how you're making me feel

Rrraah
Tell her that I just can't go on
Tell her that there's just something wrong
Tell her that I just can't go on
Uh huh

Tell her that I just can't go on
Tell her that there's just something wrong
Tell her that I just can't go on
Uh huh
Oh no

Six records in
Don't know where to begin
Singing nonny na na na na
Tell her that I just can't go on

You'll follow through it's the best you can do
Singing hey nonny na na na na
Tell her that I just can't go on
C'mon hey nonny na na na na

Tell her that I just can't go on
