Until the light go down I want to see you
Until the lights go down I want to feel you
I walked the empty streets just to be with her
She opened up my eyes with velvet shivers
We'll do it again
The splendor of the time that came between us
We'll follow our demise and we'll be fearless
I spoke to you in wishes our last whisper
Until the lights go down if not forever
We'll do it again
