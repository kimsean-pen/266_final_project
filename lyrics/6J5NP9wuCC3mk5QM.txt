Sleep well
Tucked tight
Make sure you hide the night
This was for the best

Stay out
Of sight
At the scene of the crime
To avoid an arrest

We will brawl for the cause
That's all we've got
No matter the cost
We're singing
Whoa-oh
Whoa-ah-o
Whoa-oh
Whoa-ah-o
Oh, no, no, no

Beggars and thieves
Is what we had to be
Un-invited guests
Shake this disease
They'll quarantine this street
But color me impressed

We will brawl for the cause
That's all we've got
No matter the cost
We're singing
Whoa-oh
Whoa-ah-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-ah-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-ah-oh
Oh, no, no, no

Whoa-oh
Whoa-ah-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-ah-oh
Oh, no, no, no

I know we won't get caught
But if we do
we'll say we never knew
This is our chance to lose it

Whoa-oh
Whoa-ah-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-ah-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-ah-oh
Oh, no

Whoa-oh
Whoa-ah-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-ah-oh, no...
