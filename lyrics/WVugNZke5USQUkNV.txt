Late night, driving
Thinking "where are we going?"
Don't doubt, don't ask
Go fast, headed straight for the past
My house, my room
Too soon, what are we doing?
Why does this feel so good?

Dim the light
Close your eyes
Here again to test the water
Always fight
What we find
But we search a little longer

These are truths we're second guessing
There's no use in not confessing
Never right
But tonight
Think we might be getting warmer
(Get on, we can keep it on the low)
(Get off, we can keep it on the low)
(Get on, we can keep it on the low)
(Get off, we can keep it on the low)

Heartbeats, racing
Tracing what it's been craving
I can't help but want it
Don't know how to admit
No right time or place to open my mouth and say
Why does this feel so good?

Dim the light
Close your eyes
Here again to test the water
Always fight
What we find
But we search a little longer

These are truths we're second guessing
There's no use in not confessing
Never right
But tonight
Think we might be getting warmer
(Get on, we can keep it on the low)
(Get off, we can keep it on the low)
(Get on, we can keep it on the low)
(Get off, we can keep it on the low)

Warmer to us, warmer to love
Warmer to everything we came here to touch

Dim the light
Close your eyes
Here again to test the water
Always fight
What we find
But we search a little longer

These are truths we're second guessing
There's no use in not confessing
Never right
But tonight
Think we might be getting warmer
(Get on, we can keep it on the low)
(Get off, we can keep it on the low)
(Get on, we can keep it on the low)
(Get off, we can keep it on the low)
