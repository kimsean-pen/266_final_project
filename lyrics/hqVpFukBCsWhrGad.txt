I used to shout
Across the room to you
And you'd come dancin'
Like a fool
Shuffle step
You funky mother
Come to me
All warm as covers

Rest with me
My lovely brother
For you see
There is no other
Memory so sad and sweet
I'll see you soon
Save me a seat

Oh, Well I'm cryin'
Oh, Now my lovely man
Oh, Yes I'm cryin'
Oh, Now and no one can
We never fill the
The hole you left my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can

In my room
I'm all alone
Waiting for you
To get home
Listen to Roberta Flack
But I know you won't come back

Oh, Well I'm cryin'
Oh, Now my lovely man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can

Just in case
You never knew
I miss you slim
I love you too
Oh, See my heart
It's black and blue
When I die
I will find you

Oh, Well I'm cryin'
Oh, Now my lovely man
Oh, Yes I'm cryin'
Oh, Now and no one can
We Never fill the
The hole you left my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can

Well I'm cryin'
My lovely man
Well I'm cryin'
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I miss you
when i die my lovely man
I'll see you later
My lovely man
We have some good time
My lovely man
