The sorrows still aching within my heart
You were once my light
But now you are lost
Now there's no one left that I can trust

Waning behind locked doors
I'm breaking down once more
A true love is hard to find
A joyful life is hard to come by

The pain is still aching within my mind
I used to love my life
But those times passed by
Now I'm just a prisoner of the night

Waning behind locked doors
I'm breaking down once more
A true love is hard to find
A joyful life is hard to come by

If I could find my way through the night
I'd still be lost without you by my side

Waning behind locked doors
I'm breaking down once more
A true love is hard to find
A joyful life is hard to come by

Waning behind locked doors
I'm breaking down once more
A true love is hard to find
A joyful life is hard to come by
