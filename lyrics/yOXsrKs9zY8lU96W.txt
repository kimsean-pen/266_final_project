I've been you, I've been everywhere you're going.
yeah all that you're knowing.
(boy I'm gonna make you mine)
That might be true,
but I don't need your wind-bag wisdom,
and all the restriction.

In one ear and out of the other,
if you feel the urge to share.
Think again cause you're not my mother.
Actually I'm not contractually obliged to care

Dropping dimes, laying sweet feeds on my homies.
No one can slow me down.
(boy I'm gonna make you mine)
Dipsy-do, I won't use the flask now
Baby when we drive around and seize a little time
while you work out your schemes in dealing Wichita.

If you flood the lane on me brother
watch out for my step back three.
I put the I in team like no other.
Actually I'm not contractually obliged to share.

buddy, you're just connected bones.
So lose that,
lose that,
lose that telephone

and call
us all.
