All you want from me
Are three little words
But you just get me laughing
A quiet sound
I know I'm with you now
But this all might end
So save all the 'I love you's
And let's not pretend

Cause you won't hear it now
And you won't hear it then
I love you, no
We couldn't even start

Before we reached the end

You can be a little full-on
Cause I know what you need
That really doesn't mean
You'll get it from me
Lying to yourself
Doesn't make it easier
'Save us both the time
Let's be together

We'll be fine'
You say, but

Cause you won't hear it now
And you won't hear it then

I love you, no-o
We couldn't even start
Before we reached the end
And I love you, no-o-o

And you won't hear it now
And you won't hear it then, no no no no
We couldn't even start
Before we reached the end end end end

So take the time
And you might understand
That feelings have no thoughts

And they ain't got any plans
So don't be surprised
When I look in your eyes
For all I want from you
Is a kiss or two

And you won't hear it now
And you won't hear it then
I love you, no
We couldn't even start
Before we reached the end

Cause you don't know
What I'm talking about
Well you'll see it written
In the clouds

Three little words

And you won't hear it now
And you won't hear it then
I love you, no
Cause you won't hear it
Cause you won't
Cause you won't
Cause you won't hear it now
Cause you won't hear it now
And you won't hear it then
We couldn't even start
Before we reached the end
And you won't hear it now
And you won't hear it then
With three words always end
And you know we can't pretend
