Could this be earth, could this be light
Does this mean everythings going to be alright
One look out my window theres trees talking like people
I dreamt of storms, I dreamt of sound
I dreamt of gravity keeping us around
I slept in the darkness it was lonely and it was silent
What is this love
I don't feel the same

Don't believe what this is
Can be given a name
I woke you there chasing planets on my forehead
But I forget 23 like i forget 17
And I forget my first love, like you forget a day dream
And what of all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
Will all fade to grey soon on the tv station
