A time for peace, a time for war
Time moving onwards forever more
A time to live, a time to die
Hypocrisy, now denied - denied

Life

Blood flows cold
Contempt overruns the soul
draining deep inside
The litany abide

Embraced the terror
No place to hide
Face the final judgment
Compassion now slowly dies

Stripped of all sanity
Installed a new reality
Overlord supremacy
Vengeance now implied

Embraced by terror
No place to hide
Face the final judgment
Compassion now slowly dies

Now free from strain
Existence drains away
Fallen as the rain
To be lost in life's pain

Now life slips through veins
Can comprehension fit in?
Now stretched beyond capacity
Vengeance shall be mine
