I'm breathing just to pass the time
I forgot to eat tonight
Just running down the clock today
With hope the ache will go away

Body starts to shake
Head begins to spin
Leaves me in its wake
I'm paralysed with pain

We suffer in our heartmachine
Unstable
Feeling everything
Pins and needles stitching up my skin
We suffer

Hope is strange, sometimes it leads you on
There's no exception when you're halfway gone
The second chance flash of light that brought me to my knees
A burning vision etched in memories

Body starts to shake
Head begins to spin
Leaves me in its wake
I'm paralysed with pain

We suffer in our heartmachine
Unstable
Feeling everything
Pins and needles stitching up my skin
We suffer
Trapped in a heartmachine

Time heals the wounds, it builds up strength inside
Fixing the truth is nothing left to hide

Suffering, unstable
Pins and needles
We suffer, trapped in our heartmachine
