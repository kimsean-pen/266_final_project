Tonight
The Birds are
Watching me
Today have
money
Part of used
To do
But it's hard and tiring
I don't understand
I don't understand

I know how it feels
Being sick and
Woke up
I just need a pice of you
To talk
When I have enough
I can leeave all in peace
At the end of crissatory bruise
Something must tell
That is going to an end
Living every day through sadness
Stop being such a fatalist

We flew In trance
A story for you
He likes my carcer
Distantly

Down By your feet
Can start lie
If you want to be
Start something
