I lost my head this afternoon
Trying to find the words to use, I loose
I said I thought of you
You crept into my heart
There must've been a side door
Left unlocked
She said I've thought it too

And into my arms
I've been down on my luck
By the blood red trees
I could see her calling
I liked you all the time
But since there's a gap in my chest
A few inches wide
A kiss by the kitchen tide
Between the eyes

It makes me positively ill
Your sky is laced with tender red through
I said I've dreamt of you
It's like I've been asleep for months
And my emotions flag me own
You said you thought it too

And into my arms
I've been down on my luck
By the blood red trees
I could see her calling
I liked you all the time
But since there's a gap in my chest
A few inches wide
A kiss by the kitchen tide
Between the eyes

You crept into my heart
You crept into my heart
You
You crept into my heart
You crept into my heart
You

And into my arms
I've been down on my luck
By the blood red trees
I could see her calling
I liked you all the time
But since there's a gap in my chest
A few inches wide
A kiss by the kitchen tide
Between the eyes
