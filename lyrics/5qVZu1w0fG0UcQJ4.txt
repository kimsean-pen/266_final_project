Summertime, summertime
brought me back to thinking you were mine, all those times.
We laid it down and left it all behind, we were blind.

Oh, the summertime.
We could ride, we could ride.
Take my hand and watch the world go by.
Laugh or cry, well we need to try, get off the line, time to fly.
Oh, the summertime.

Go on ahead and let it fade away.
No looking back you know the past will stay.
It's you and me, we could get out of here.
Jump in and go and we could drive for years.
We could feel alive...

Here we are, here we are,
windows down we see a falling star.
Stop the car.
Waiting for nothing but our beating hearts, going far.

Oh, the summertime.
So feel the air, feel the air,
take the map and point to anywhere.
I don't care. Fingers through your hair,
the sky I've seen blue and green.
Oh, the summertime.

Go on ahead and let it fade away.
No looking back you know the past will stay.
It's you and me, we could get out of here.
Jump in and go and we could drive for years.
We could feel alive...

Drivin away, leaving it all behind.
Drivin away
Drivin away, and leaving it all behind.
and drivin away
Drivin away, just drive away, leaving it all behind
Drivin away, just drive away, leaving it all behind
Drivin away, just drive away, leaving it all behind, driving away, yeah
Just drive away, yeah yeah yeah, go...
