swallow whole
lose myself in you
take a chance
take a chance with me

poured out in wine
chance to run away
take a breath
take a breath
same sign

hair of gold swims through
caught in my mind
painted picture prize
jewels on a crown
poisoned wine
i fall to the floor
caught a glimps of truth

swallow whole
lose myself in you
take a chance
take a chance with me

hair of gold swims through
caught in my mind
painted picture prize
jewels on a crown
poisoned wine
i fall to the floor
caught a glimps of truth

hair of gold
hair of gold
