Second verse:
...multiply

Mark these ambitions with a symbol of an eye
Vision black remain
And will never stop

The future hangs on the "option smile"
[Either no words and just that chaotic sound
effect or some woirds we will NEVER be able to know]
Pay the ferryman, ignore the price

As you stare into a matrix of lies
The abyss will never look back
Of horror, and the black shawls
