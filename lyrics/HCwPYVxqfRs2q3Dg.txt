I'm played out, it's laid out
I'm really hoping you don't care
This pent up momentum
You're starting to become aware

I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't
I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't

We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love

It's all there, it's not fair
Where will our hearts be when it's done?
When night falls, and you don't call
I'll stay up waiting for the sun

I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't
I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't

We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love

I had the upper hand
But I, I, I
I had the upper hand
But I
O-oh

We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
