I picked you out in a crowd of a thousand faces
Yeah, I found you, oh, oh, oh
I chose the why's and the when's, all the random places
Yeah, I chose you, oh, oh, oh

I let you see me, let you believe it was your move
So smooth, my rules

Well, you think you are the one who got me, boy
But I got you
I've been playing with you like a little toy
Yeah, I got you, I got you
I got you

You'd be surprised all the times I almost told you
But I stayed cool, oh, oh, oh
I almost broke but I knew I would get to hold you
'Cause I'm no fool, oh, oh, oh
You came up to me, and did the very thing I knew
That you do, oh, oh, oh

Well, you think you are the one who got me, boy
But I got you
I've been playing with you like a little toy
Yeah, I got you, I got you

You gave me all control
I got you
I took your heart and soul
I got you
For me I'm gonna roll
I got, you, you, you

I got you, oh yeah
I got you and I love it
I got you
Yeah, I got you

I got you and I love it
I got you
Yeah, I got you

Well, you think you are the one who got me, boy
But I got you
I've been playing with you like a little toy
Yeah, I got you

I got you and I love it
I got you
Yeah, I got you

I got you and I love it
I got you
Yeah, I got you

I got you and I love it
