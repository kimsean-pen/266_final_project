Black Rites in the Black Nights
Burning funeral pyre
Black Rites in the Black Nights
Heads on a stake
Witches of hellfire

Crawling out from the serpent's nest
Seductive libertines undress
With passion as weapon
They circle and embrace their pray
Blasphemous sorceress of moral decay

Black Rites in the Black Nights
Burning funeral pyre
Black Rites in the Black Nights
Heads on a stake
Witches of hellfire

With venomous tongues they spit
Their ravenous dark deceit
Sinister illusion of magical spiritual revolutions
Sacral wisdom defiled in filth

Black Rites
The blindfold will fall
Sadistic holy sacraments
Will be repent

From the ashes the ways of old reappear
The earth rumbles and the haze disappear
The bells of liberty will chime
The witches dance to the sound of nature's call
Black rites magic unfolds
