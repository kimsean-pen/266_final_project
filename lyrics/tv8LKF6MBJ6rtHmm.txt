Call it what you want
Call it what you want

Yeah, we're locked up in ideas
We like to label everything
Well, I'm just gonna do here what I gotta do here
'Cause I gotta keep myself free

You're ducking and moving
Just to hide your bruises from all your enemies
And I'm in the crossfire dodging bullets
From your expectancies, yeah yeah

We've got nothing to lose
You better run and hide
You crossed the line
I've got a knife behind my back, just sayin'

We've got nothing to prove
Your social guides give you swollen eyes
But what I've got can't
Be bought so you can just

Call it what you want
Call it what you want
Call it what you want
Call it what you want

You've taken your words and you take your judgments
And stick them onto everything
If it don't conform to what you were born into
Then you run the other way

You say, "Now what's your style and
Who do you listen to?" Who cares?
Well, that rat race ladder-climbing
Fake-face smile's got nothing on me

We've got nothing to lose
You better run and hide
You crossed the line
I've got a knife behind my back, just sayin'

We've got nothing to prove
Your social guides give you swollen eyes
But what I've got can't
Be bought so you can just

Call it what you want
Call it what you want
Call it what you want
Call it what you want

You can call it what you want
What you want
Call it what you want
What you want
You can call it what you want
What you want
Call it what you want
You can call it what you want
Call it what you want
Call it what you want
Call it what you want
Call it what you want
Call it what you want
Call it what you want
Call it what you want, want, want, want...
