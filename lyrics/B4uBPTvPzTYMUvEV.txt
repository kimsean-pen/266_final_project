With sadness in my heart
And joy in my mind
I thought about the ghosts
That we left behind

With everyone around
Telling us what to do
With deafening sound
Whisper I love you

The fire in your eyes
May it never go out
The sweetness of your tears
Make sit feel like night

I see no escape
From the roads we always take
What do we have to do
On this judgement day

(Your mine) Your mine now, but your not my sister
(Your mine) Your mine now, but your not my slave
(Your mine) Your mine now, but your not my child
(Your mine) Your mine now, but your not my slave

Your missing the whole point
your not my little pet
Don't throw away your life
The game's not over yet
I do not own your soul
Don't want you in a cage
I only want your heart
To find a special place

(Oooooo But your not my slave)
(Oooooo But your not my slave)

Your missing the whole point
Your not my little pet
Don't throw away your life
The game's not over yet

(Your mine) but your not my sister
(Your mine) but your not my slave
(Your mine) but your not my child
(Your mine) but your not my slave

(Your mine) Your mine now, but your not my sister
(Your mine) Your mine now, but your not my slave
(Your mine) Your mine now, but your not my child
(Your mine) Your mine now, but your not my slave

With Sand in my heart
And Flowers in my head
I thought about us both
And the lives we led

From pages in a book
To pictures on a screen
We mold ourselves like clay
From someone elses dream

One second you are pressed
Just like stones at my feet
But I am not a king
Please don't worship me

With everyone around
Telling us what to do
With deafening sound
Whisper I love you

Your missing the whole point
your not my little pet
Don't throw away your life
The game's not over yet
I do not own your soul
Don't want you in a cage
I only want your heart
To find a special place

You're mine now But you're not my sister
You're mine now But you're not my slave
You're mine But you're not my child
You're mine now But you're not my sister
You're mine But you're not my slave
You're mine now But you're not my child
You're mine But you're not my sister
You're mine now But you're not my slave
You're mine now But you're not my child
You're mine now But you're not my sister
You're mine now But you're not my slave
You're mine now But you're not my child
