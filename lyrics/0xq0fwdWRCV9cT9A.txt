The green mermaid
And the wavy mane
The California dream
Riding a unicorn through your Dal√≠
The free fantasy
The care free
That beginners luck
The sugar don't live up
Sailing on a banana peel
Your trophy
Start throwing up a boat to bar

You magnify the universe
Grab your purse
Grab your love
Pretty girl, don't get stuck
You're aiming the royal team
Fast luck
TV dreams
Pretty girl, don't get struck

So, Bubble Hills
Don't you ever burst?
Never let her down
Tossing out time
While you drag your crumbs
The birds ate their round
Hawaiian drinks in a famous place
You're poems are innocent
Those new lashes don't go to waste
But it could pay your rent
You magnify the universe
Grab your purse
Grab your love
Pretty girl, don't get stuck
You're aiming the royal team
Fast luck
TV dreams
Pretty girl, don't get struck
Pretty girl, don't get stuck
Pretty girl, don't get struck
Pretty girl, don't get stuck
struck struck struck...
