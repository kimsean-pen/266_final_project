Your mouth is a revolver, firin' bullets in the sky
Your love is like a soldier, loyal till you die
And I've been looking at the stars for a long, long time
I've been puttin' out fires, all my life
If everybody wants a flames, they don't wanna get burnt
'N' today is our turn

Days like these lead to, nights like this lead to
Love like ours, you light the spark in my bonfire heart
People like us, we don't need that much
Just someone that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

This world is getting colder, strangers passin' by
No one offers you a shoulder, no one looks you in the eye
But I've been lookin' at you for a long, long time
Just trying to break through, trying to make you mine
Everybody wants a flame, they don't wanna to get burnt
Well today is our turn

Days like these lead to, nights like this lead to
Love like ours, you light the spark in my bonfire heart
People like us, we don't need that much
Just someone that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

(Our bonfire heart)
(Our bonfire heart)
(Oh, our bonfire heart)
(You light the spark)

People like us, we don't need that much
Just someone that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

Days like these lead to, nights like this lead to
Love like ours, you light the spark in my bonfire heart
People like us, we don't need that much
Just someone that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts
(Our bonfire heart)

Days like these lead to, nights like this lead to
Love like ours, you light the spark in my bonfire heart
People like us, we don't need that much
Just someone that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts
