You
You taste so sweet
But this feeling's left me pulling out my teeth
And now this
Euphoric state
Paints pictures in my head I can't erase

You're just another little thrill
That I can't quite live without

I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you

If
I cut the ties
I'd relapse just to have you one last time
And then you
You reel me in
Take me back to all the demons left inside

But your
Seduction didn't kill
It just left me paralysed

And I'm, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
And I'm, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you

Take me back to the start
Take me back to the start
Take me home, Take me home

Take me back to the start
Take me back to the start
Take me home, Take me home

And I'm, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
And I'm, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you

And I'm, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
And I'm, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you

And I'm, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
And I'm, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you

I'm, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you

I'm, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
