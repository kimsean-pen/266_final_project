Every night I see you walk
Walking by, walking by
You hold your head so close to hers
I could cry, yeah, I could cry
I want to be that girl tonite
Girl tonite, girl tonite

CHORUS
How much more can I take
Before I go crazy, oh yeah
How much more heartache
Before I go crazy, oh yeah

Love's in your eyes
Making me cry
Why isn't it me?
She's looking good
Just like I would
If it could be me

CHORUS
