All I see is, shattered pieces
I can't keep it, hidden like a secret
I can't look away
From all this pain in the world we've made

Every day you need, a bulletproof vest
To save yourself, from what you could never guess
Am I safe today
When I step outside in the wars we wage

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

Sound it off, this is our call
Rise and revolution
It's our time to change it all
Rise and revolution

Unite, and fight
To make a better life
Everybody, one for all
Sound off, this is the call

Tonight, we rise
Rise
Tonight, we rise
Rise
Tonight, we rise

Like a hand grenade, thrown in a hurricane
Spinning in chaos, trying to escape the flame
Yesterday is gone
Faster than the blast of a car bomb

And when the scars heal, the pain passes
As hope burns, we rise from the ashes
Darkness fades away
And the light shines on a brave new day

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

Sound it off, this is our call
Rise and revolution
It's our time to change it all
Rise and revolution

Unite, and fight
To make a better life
Everybody, one for all
Sound off, this is the call

Tonight, we rise
Rise
Tonight, we rise
Rise
Tonight, we rise

In a world gone mad (In a voice so sad)
Sometimes it's crazy (Crazy)
To fight for what you believe
But you can't give up (No)
If you want to keep what you love (Keep what you love)
Keep what you love (Keep what you love)
Keep what you love
Never give up, no

Rise
Rise and revolution
Rise
Rise and revolution
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call

Rise
Like we're alive
Tonight, we rise
Rise
Make a better life
Tonight, we rise
Rise

Rise, rise
Rise and revolution
Rise, rise
Rise and revolution
Rise

"There's a guy here with a gun!"
"Ma'am? Ma'am?"
"Kids, get under the table! Get under the table!"

"We are getting in reports, from all around the globe
Showing the highest unemployment rates
Since the end of World War Two.
Many are losing their jobs, their homes
And in many cases - their hope."

"You are such a failure!
What's wrong with you?
You're worthless!
You can't do anything right!
I wish you had never been born!"
