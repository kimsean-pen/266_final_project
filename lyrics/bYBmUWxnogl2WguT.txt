I set out on monday
the night was cold and vast
and my brother slept
And though i left quite quietly
my father raged and raged
and my mother wept
Now, my life was like a river
all sucked into the ground
and then the hammer came down
lord, the hammer came down
Many miles did i roam
through the ice and through the snow
my horse died on the seventh day
I stumbled into a city
where the people tried to kill me
and i ran in shame
Then i came upon a river
and i laid my saddle down
and then the hammer came down
lord, the hammer came down
it knocked me to the ground
and i said, "please, please
take me back to my home town"
lord, the hammer came down
Now i've been made weak by visions
many visions did i see
all through the night
On the seventh hour an angel came
with many snakes in all his hands
and i fled in fright
I pushed off into the river
and the water came around
and then the hammer came down
lord, the hammer came down
and it did not make a sound
and i said, "please, please
take me back to my home ground"
lord, the hammer came down
