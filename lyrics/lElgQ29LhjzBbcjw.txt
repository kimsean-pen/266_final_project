Keep your chin up when you're feeling lonely
Don't let 'em get you down
Ain't no use in you sitting all alone
Hanging around for someone to call
They won't come knocking at all
Don't run and hide
Even if it hurts you inside
So I said
Give as good as you get, yeah

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You'd better do it, 'cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You're never gonna help yourself, yeah

Come on, go, get up, hey
Sure feels good

Keep your big hands off my money
Don't try and pull me down
You're taking me out to wine and dine me
Trying to wind me round and around
And bind me to your legal contract (Ha, ha)
Rumour has it that you can play it dirty
I'll tell you what I'll do about that, that, yeah
I'll play you at your own game

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You'd better do it, 'cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You're never gonna help yourself, yeah

That's good
Play it again

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You'd better do it, 'cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
It's everyone for themselves
