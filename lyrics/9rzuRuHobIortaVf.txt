Stay awake, stay serene with me
I've been feeling little lonely
You're so soft underneath my skin

Find me in the dark
Drinking in my diamond tears
I'm not really good at
I don't know how to handle my drugs and money
Ooh drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs
Drugs and money
Ooh drugs, drugs, drugs
All of this pain, lost in relief
I can feel drugs, drugs, drugs
Get me out of this cage
Love and realise
Oh I can feel drugs, drugs, drugs
Baby you are so good to me
Baby so good to me

Stay awake, stay serene with me
But i just can't call you when i'm so far down, down, down
How can you love someone so weak?
I should be stronger
I-i should be, i'm fine

And tie me in the dark
[?] my golden sins
I once [?] dream
So i skin and worry about my

Drugs and money
Ooh drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs
Drugs and money
Ooh drugs, drugs, drugs
All of this pain, lost in relief
I can feel drugs, drugs, drugs
Get me out of this cage
Love and realise
Oh I can feel drugs, drugs, drugs
Baby you are so good to me
Baby so good to me
