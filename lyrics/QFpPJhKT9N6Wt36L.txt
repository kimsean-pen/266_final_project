I don't remember quite how I met you,
Wasn't long ago
Just get a picture of sun
In your eyes, the waves in your hair
Maybe it's something said in a movie
Or you could've said last night
Just took me out on a limb
And I don't really know what I'm doing here

And sometimes I'm caught in a landslide
My beat's so in time, can you look at me
I'm out of reach, I'll talk if it feels right
I've had my last chance on the stairway

Funny, it's just like a scene out of Voltaire
Twisting out of sight
'Cause when all the curtains are pulled back
We'll turn and see the circles we traced
Ain't no game... when you're playing with fire
It doesn't seem right that we fight
So the party runs on all night

And sometimes I'm caught in a landslide
My beats so in time, can you look at me
I'm out of reach, I'll talk if it feels right
So nervous to say, tell me, can't you see
If you want, I fall out forever
I can't say no more... bebe dance with me
And please don't say leave it till later
I've had my last chance on the stairway

Wonder why
Wonder why... what makes me rise so high
Maybe it's something they put in your perfume
Or the look in your eyes
It could be the atmosphere sinking
I don't even know what you're thinking
Don't even know what you're drinking
But it keeps this heaven alive

And sometimes I'm caught in a landslide
My beats so in time, can you look at me
I'm out of reach, I'll talk if it feels right
So nervous to say, tell me, can't you see
If you want, I fall out forever
I can't say no more... bebe dance with me
And please don't say leave it till later
I've had my last chance on the stairway
