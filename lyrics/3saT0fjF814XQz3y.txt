You're like the moon and the stars
You're my shadow, you're my light through the dark
And anything you do turns to art
I hear it calling, calling for me
Gravity

Even though we're miles apart
I knew it right from the start
That I'm not leaving without you
Said I'm not leaving without you

Gravity, don't run away from me
Gravity, don't run away from me
Gravity, don't run away from me
Gravity (don't run away from me)

Even though we're miles apart
I knew it right from the start
That I'm not leaving without you
Said I'm not leaving without you
(It's been a long time)

Gravity, don't run away from me
Gravity, don't run away from me
Gravity, don't run away from me
Gravity-
One, two, three, hit it!

(We are good to go for a main engine start, t-minus 10...)
(9... Ignition sequence starts)
(6... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
(Gravity-)
(Liftoff, we have a liftoff!)

Gravity, don't get away from me
Gravity, don't get away from me
Gravity, don't get away from me
Gravity...
