Kids all jumping bonfires on the heath
Kids all jumping bonfires on the heath
How am I going to get myself to sleep?

Late October sunlight in the wood
Late October sunlight in the wood
Nothing here quite moves the way it should

Laughing windows up and down the street
Laughing windows up and down the street
And the walls are closing in on me

Kids all jumping bonfires on the heath
Kids all jumping bonfires on the heath
How am I going to get myself to sleep?
