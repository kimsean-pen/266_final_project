Caught up in the feeling
Cut right through the ceiling
Ground below receding
Blink of an eye, higher than high
Father, sister, brothers
Others born of mothers
Every friend and lover
Now is the time, get on the ride
Caught up in the feeling
Up against the feeling
Caught up in the feeling
Now is the time, I'm gonna ride

Like a resolution
Crying in confusion
There's one sure solution
Leave it behind, it's time to ride
Pull into the station
With no hesitation
Well, congratulations
I'm by your side, it's time to ride

Say the word and I'll make it go
(Alright!) Where I used to be miserable
In a vision, a confession ain't visible
We are more than only human
Roll, roll, roll, like reflections roll
(Alright!) From my hands to your hands come and take a hold
This is the ride of your life
And it goes all day and all night

Every friend and lover
Soon we will discover
We turn into each other
Into the night, we're gonna ride
Think about the future
Think about the future
Think about the future
I know it's mine, I'm gonna ride
Everyone together
All at once, together
Everyone together
Look to the sky, it's time to ride

Like a resolution
Crying in confusion
There's one sure solution
Leave it behind, it's time to ride
Pull into the station
With no hesitation
Well, congratulations
I'm on your side, it's time to ride

Say the word and I'll make it go
(Alright!) Where I used to be miserable
In the mirror, a confession ain't visible
We are more than only human
Roll, roll, roll, like reflections roll
(Alright!) From my hands to your hands come and take a hold
This is the ride of your life
And it goes all day and all night

Say the word and I'll make it go
(Alright!) Where I used to be miserable
In the mirror, a reflection ain't visible
We are more than only human
Roll, roll, roll, like reflections roll
(Alright!) From my hands to your hands come and take a hold
This is the ride of your life
And it goes all day and all night
