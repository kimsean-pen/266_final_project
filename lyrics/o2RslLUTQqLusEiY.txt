Love
Physical love
They're hiding their love
Love in your heart

So you say
Without love
Oh, yesterday
Eternal
Eternal love

Physical love
Are you right in front of my eyes?
Love, love, love
How is it possible?
I'm feeling the way now
Right in front of my eyes
I'll love you 'til you belong

Baby, I'm right here
Every night, lie
You hold on
Baby, take all this mess
You have the sun in your eyes
Oh, oh, oh, you

It's all my fault
I feel love for you
Want to see around you
Breathe, belong
Please breathe
All my dreaming belongs to you

Waterfall before you fall, face it
With love and contradiction so
Too much to be contained
Wrap myself around all love

Physical love
Right in front of my eyes
Oh, oh, love
How is it possible?
It belongs to you
Right in front of my eyes
Right in front of you
Baby, holding you
