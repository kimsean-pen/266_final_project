I'd guess they would say
We could set this world ablaze
Please, please take my hand, please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around

It is hard to see
Through all the haze at the top of the trees
Hold my head on stable ground
Watch as the Earth falls all around

Please, please take my hand, please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around

Faltering footsteps, dead end path
All that I need is this wise man's staff
Encased in crystal, he leads the way
I guess they'd say we could set the world ablaze

Please, please take my hand, please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around

I guess they would say
We can set the world ablaze
Hold my head on stable ground
Watch as the Earth falls all around

Take my black soul
Alive in the fires that burn my skin
Guide my eyes all through this maze
I guess they'd say we could set the world ablaze

All that I have seen
Standing on the edge, the foot of precipice
Floating in the sea
Past the king of swords, quickly to the shore

The last baron
The last baron

Ghost of man
Surrounds me in my slumber
I have no fear
As your wing is my shelter

Cyanide he craves
Coursing through his veins, providing him with strength
To see this to the end
Afraid of psychic eyes, faith in mystic power

The last baron
The last baron

Will he save me?
Will he save me?

I was standing staring at the world
And I can't see it
I was standing staring at the world
And I can't see it

I was standing staring at the world
And I can't see it
I was standing staring at the world
And I still can't see it

I was standing staring at the world
And I can't see it
I was standing staring at the world
And I still can't see it

All that I have seen
Standing on the edge, the foot of precipice
Floating in the sea
Past the king of swords, quickly to the shore

The last baron
The last baron

Ghost of man
Surrounds me in my slumber
I have no fear
As your wing is my shelter

Cyanide he craves
Coursing through his veins, providing him with strength
To see this to the end
Afraid of psychic eyes, faith in mystic power

The last baron
The last baron

Will he save me?
Will he save me?
Will he save me?

I'd guess they would say
We could set this world ablaze

Please, please take my hand, please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around

It is hard to see
Through all the haze at the top of the trees

Watch as the Earth falls all around

Please, please take my hand, please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around

All that I need is this wise man's staff
