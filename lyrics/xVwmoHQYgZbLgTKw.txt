I think I heard it 'bout a thousand times or more

Dont'you bother wasting time
You're telling me you're so much better than before
But I find it hard believin'
Until you prove me wrong
If you really want my love

If I'm all you're dreaming of
You may find it tough
Cause words are not enough
(The story goes...)
I wouldn't ever make the same mistake again

Don't wanna be nobody's fool

I wouldn't play a losing game when you can't win
There ain't nothing that I'm missing
So you better prove me wrong
You know it ain't easy
To find a new way
After everything that we've been through
So come on and please me
And show me I'm wrong
Let me see you bring the best out of you
