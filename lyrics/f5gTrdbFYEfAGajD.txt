Can't get you out of my head I try
thoughts of you I just cannot defy
we must of had something real strong
I'm tossing turning all night long
can't eve enjoy a fantasy
without your face jumping in a scene
can't escape your grip cause
you clutch my mind
wanna dream of other girls
but you I find
thought getting you
out of my heart was hard
but now I see that was just the star
your legacy is trying to drive me mad
to forget I concentrate on all the bad
can't shake this monkey off my back
tried drinking everything
from beer to jack
no answers in all the books I've read
all I know is I've got the get
you our of my head

Solo

Got to get it
