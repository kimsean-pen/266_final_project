It's the same in every country
When you say you're leaving
Left behind the loved ones
Waiting silent in the hall

Where you're going, lies adventure
Others only dream of
Red and green light, this is real
And so you go to war

For the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier for your country
What's the difference? All the same

Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold, bloody war

There is no one that will save you
Going down in flames
No surrender, certain death
You look it in the eye

On the shores of tyranny
You crashed a human wave
Paying for my freedom
With your lonely unmarked graves

For the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier for your country
What's the difference? All the same

Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold, bloody war

Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold, bloody war
Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold, bloody war
These colours don't run from cold, bloody war
