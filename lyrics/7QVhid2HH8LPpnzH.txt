You, who brought
The sunshine to my eyes
You, who wondered
Through my sad disguise
And I have a love
That cannot die ... for you

High priestess of my heart
Tell me that we wont part

Then lets get together in the sky
To leave the lonely world
To wonder why
For we have a love
We cant denie ... so true
