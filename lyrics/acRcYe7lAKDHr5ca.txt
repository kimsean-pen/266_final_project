Wake up, you never looked so glum.
Tell me how will we know they can't hear us coming?
It's easy for me I got a headstart running away.
Keep up, or your disease spread quick.
So how did you learn to be sick so cunning?
It's easy to see but you just keep on loving alone.
Did you hear that, I got a real bad feeling...
How many moles do you suppose they're keeping?
Don't make a sound they're not dead, just sleeping.

Dire, dire, dire, is fleeting (6x)
