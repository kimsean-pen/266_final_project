Cigars in the summertime under the sky by the light,
I can feel you read my mind,
I can see it in your eyes,
Under the moon as it plays,
Like music every line,
There's a rug with bleeding dye under the fan in the room,
Where the passion's burning high,
By the chair with the leopard skin under the light,
It's always Penny and me tonight (Sayin' OhOh, MmmMm, Yeah),

On the plane step up with both my feet,
Riding in seat number 3 on a flight to NYC,
Got my bean in a coffee cup next to my seat,
Catch the view and another good book to read,
Sending me home on the friendly skies,
Missin' her eyes,
It's always Penny and me tonight,

Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down,
Turn the radio up, and push the pedal to the ground,
And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies,
Close our eyes, pretend to fly,
It's always Penny and me tonight, (Singing OhOh NoNoNo)

Staring at a million city lights,
But it's still Penny and I all alone beneath the sky,
Feel the wind brushing slowly by,
If I could soar I would try, to take these wings and fly,
Away to where the leaves turn red,
But no matter where I am instead,
Singin' along to feelin' alright, (MmMm)
We're makin' it by in the pink moonlight,
It's always Penny and me tonight,

Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down,
Turn the radio up, push the pedal to the ground,
And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies,
Close our eyes, pretend to fly, (Sing'n OhOh)
Close our eyes pretend to fly,
It's always Penny and me tonight,

Penny likes to get away,
And drown her pain, in lemonade,
And Penny Dreams Of Rainy Days,
And Nights Up Late By The Fireplace
An aimless conversations bout' the better days,

(MmmMmMm)

Singin' along to feeling alright, yeah,
We're makin' it by in the pink moonlight,
It's always Penny and me tonight,

Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down,
Turn the radio up, push the pedal to the ground,
And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies,

close our eyes pretend to fly,
close our eyes pretend to fly,
It's always Penny and me tonight, (Sing OhOh)

Penny and me tonight,
Penny and me tonight,
Penny and me tonight.(yeah)
