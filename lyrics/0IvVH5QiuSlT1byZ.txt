Go to church, accepting God
Absorbing their religious fraud
Shunning those who disagree
What will it take for you to see?

Collection plates always full
With hard earned cash of pawns and tools
Exposing them for who they are
The truth is even more bizarre

Men of God molesting kids
Embracing what their God forbids
Turned to Christ because you're weak
Thinking you'd find inner peace

Emptiness when you confide
Leaves you feeling dead inside
Disgusted by your former priest
You rat him out to the police

He cries in court and says a prayer
Before his sentence to the chair
Religion you once held so high
Is not but a giant lie
