Daddy, daddy, come and look, see what I have found
A little ways away from here, while digging in the ground
Come away Melinda, come in and close the door
It's nothing, just a picture book, they had before the war

Daddy, daddy come and see, daddy, come and look
Where there's four or five little Melinda girls
Inside my picture book
Come away Melinda, come in and close the door
There were lots of little girls like you
Before they had the war

Oh daddy, daddy come and see, daddy hurry do!
While there's someone in a pretty dress
She's all grown up like you, won't you tell me why
Come away Melinda, come in and close the door
That someone is your mummy, you had before the war

Daddy, daddy tell me if you can
Why can't things be the way they were, before the war began

Come away Melinda, come in and close the door
The answer lies in yesterday, before they had the war
