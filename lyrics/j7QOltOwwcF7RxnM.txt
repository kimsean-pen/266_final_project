I would swallow my pride,
I would choke on the rinds,
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside,
Swallow my doubt
Turn it inside out
Find nothing but faith in nothing.
Want to put my tender heart in a blender,
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion.
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you

I burn, burn like a wicker cabinet,
Chalk white and oh so frail.
I see our time has gotten stale.
The tick tock of the clock is painful,
All sane and logical.
I want to tear it off the wall.
I hear words in clips and phrases,
I think sick like ginger ale,
My stomach turns and I exhale.

I would swallow my pride,
I would choke on the rinds,
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside.
I would swallow my doubt,
Turn it inside out,
Find nothing but faith in nothing.
Want to put my tender heart in a blender,
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion.
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you.

SoCal is where my mind states,
But it's not my state of mind.
I'm not as ugly, sad as you.
Or am I origami?
Folded up and just pretend,
Demented as the motives in your head.

I would swallow my pride,
I would choke on the rinds,
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside.
I would swallow my doubt,
Turn it inside out,
Find nothing but faith in nothing.
Want to put my tender heart in a blender,
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion.
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you.

I alone am the one you don't know you need
Take heed, feed your ego.
Make me blind when your eyes close,
Sink when you get close, tie me to the bedpost.

I alone am the one you don't know you need,
You don't know you need me.
Make me blind when your eyes close,
Tie me to the bedpost.

I would swallow my pride,
I would choke on the rinds,
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside.
Swallow my doubt,
Turn it inside out,
Find nothing but faith in nothing.
Want to put my tender heart in a blender,
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion.
Rendezvous, then I'm through,
Now I'm through with you

Through with you

Rendezvous then I'm through with you...
