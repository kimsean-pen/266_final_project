And baby don't follow their lead
'cause you'll never know
Just how the story ends, or how the story goes
And you are so confused
And baby it's just like you
To say anything else

Whenever you get this way
Just getting up for the let down,
Mmm here they come, and yes, they're here to stay
Just getting up for the let down

Oh I'm here to say that you're the star you wanna be
Just open up and look inside and you will see, yeah

Someday you'll sing it out loud
One day this will make you proud
Whoa oh, "I know..."
Whoa oh.

And baby don't follow their lead
'cause you never know
Just how the story ends, or how the story goes
And you are so confused,
And baby it's just like you
To say anything else

It's time for you to understand
Stop getting up for the let down
Oh, who you are is not up to them
Stop getting up for the let down

And I'm here to say that you're the star you wanna be
Just open up and look inside you will see

Someday you'll sing it out loud
One day this will make you proud
Whoa oh, "I know..."
Whoa oh.

Someday you'll sing it out loud
One day this will make you proud
Whoa oh, "I know..."
"I know..." is never good enough

So say what you want
(You know I'm wasting all my time)
You've gotta mean it when you say what you want
(You're only safe when you're alone)
And everybody's on your mind
Saying anything to get you by

And so to get what you want
(You know I'm wasting all my time)
You've gotta mean it when you say what you want
(You're only safe when you're alone)
You're wasting everybody's time
You're saying anything that gets you by

It's not, not, not gonna get you,
Gonna get you by

Someday you'll sing it out loud
One day this will make you proud
Whoa oh, "I know..."
"I know..." is never good enough

Someday you'll sing it out loud
One day this will make you proud
Whoa oh, "I know..."
Whoa oh,
Whoa oh, "I know..."
"I know..." is never good enough
