To making a ride inside a dream
Live in a world I've never seen
Wishes come true, that should have him
Looks familiar, feels unseen

The land of dreams
Is a little far
A ball full of light
Of non-existent

Driving along but some will play
Something I only heard you'd take
A new melody with such delay
The music will never fade away

The land of dreams
Is a little far
A ball full of light
Of non-existent
