Houston we have a problem
That's it I'm going under
Time's up for our love song
We were just a one hit wonder
Sorry I had to text it
I'm done this is my Brexit
Tried to press rewind
I swear all of my attempts were desperate
Oh, this is so crazy
Go try to amaze me
You fire back
Start yelling yelling in caps
Perhaps you, you'll know better someday
After the party's over
I hate it when we're sober
Play the music louder
Houston, we have a problem
Gotta gotta go down
Falling into bits
Is it time to say
It's all over now
Gotta gotta go down
If the pieces fit
Is it time we could
Start all over now
I gotta gotta go down
Gotta gotta go down
I gotta gotta go down
Houston, we have a problem
Come get me out from under
I've been playing my part so hard
Are you still there, I wonder
Sorry but I'm in the taxi
Shit-talking from the backseat
I've been running away
On my way down
To this dead end street
Oh so we're just crazy
Go keep on erasing all my tracks
Say I was a mess, I guess
You, you'll know better someday
After the party's over
Call back when it get's colder
Play the music louder
Houston, we have a problem
Gotta gotta go down
Falling into bits
Is it time to say
It's all over now
Gotta gotta go down
If the pieces fit
Is it time we could
Start all over now
I gotta gotta go down
Gotta gotta go down
I gotta gotta go down
I gotta gotta go down
It's all over now
I gotta gotta go down
