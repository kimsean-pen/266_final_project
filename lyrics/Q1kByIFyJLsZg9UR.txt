Black sun rising
New day dawning
Amplifying and destroying

We're on the same high you and I
Open on the same page, no sunrise

Tender talons
chase new horizons
masquerading
Black sun rising

We're on the same high you and I
Open on the same page, no sunrise

Silent movers
Black medusa
perfect timing
hallow morning

We're on the same high you and I
Open on the same page, no sunrise

Sickness fading
Darkness falling
New day dawning
Black sun rising

We're on the same high you and i
Open on the same page, no sunrise

We're on the same high you and i
Open on the same page, no sunrise

We're on the same high you and i
Open on the same page, no sunrise
