We go river running
Deep blue indigo
Feels so close to fallin'
You're more than you know
Burn bright firefly
So glow, do or die
We go river running
Hold on to what you've got
Let go of what you're not
Hold on to what you've got
Living ain't easy
Call if you need me
Living ain't easy
Call if you need me
Living ain't easy
Call if you need me
Living ain't easy
Call if you need me
(If you need me)
(If you need me)
Living ain't easy
Call if you need me
(If you need me)
We go silver surfing
Reach out in the night
Sunrise early morning
In fluorescent light
Burn bright firefly
So glow, do or die
We go river running
Hold on to what you've got
Let go of what you're not
Hold on to what you've got
Living ain't easy
Call if you need me
Living ain't easy
Call if you need me
Living ain't easy
Call if you need me
Living ain't easy
Call if you need me
(If you need me)
(If you need me)
Living ain't easy
Call if you need me
(If you need me)
