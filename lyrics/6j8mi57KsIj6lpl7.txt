Twelve strikes and I'm dying to hit the streets*
A walking nightmare in a city that never sleeps
I'm a madman with gasoline in my veins
Just need a spark and I'm ready to kill again
You never see me
Mm, you never see me come
I'm the feeling that is always on your mind
I'm the shadow that is creeping up from behind
It's a midnight vice
Oh, it's a midnight vice
Look out, it's a midnight vice
To choose the streets was your one and only mistake
When I make my move I never hesitate
A flash of lightning, it all becomes so clear
Then I see red and you disappear
I've done it
Oh, and I will do it again
I see your faces whenever I close my eyes
You live inside me until the day I die
