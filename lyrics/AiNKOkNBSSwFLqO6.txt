So
So long
So long ago
There wasn't anyone out there I thought I needed to know
But no more
When I find the day leave my mind
in the evening just as the day before
I saw the window was open
The cool air
I don't know what you saw there
Don't know what you saw in me
Sometimes I want to be enough for you
Don't ask
Know that it's understood
There's not enough of me
I saw that something was broken
I've crossed the line
I'll point you to a better time
A safer place to be
Sometimes I want to be enough for you
Don't ask
Know that it's done no good
Sometimes I want to be enough for you
Don't ask
Know that it's done no good
