Sail away
Against the odds and face
Our darkest day, let's try
As time runs out
We are fetching deep in our resolve
Looking for
A beacon, for any bit of hope

Give everything we've got
Fight with no holding back

Do everything to hold into what I
Impersonate in everything that I
Surrender for the beauty of your life
Just take my hand and let's stand by and by

Do everything to hold into what I
Impersonate in everything that I

Call my name
We'll soon be reunited
I'll be there
Time, and we'll be fine

Give everything we've got
Fight with no holding back

Do everything to hold into what I
Impersonate in everything that I
Surrender for the beauty of your lies
Just take my hand and let's stand by and by

Do everything to hold into what I
Impersonate in everything that I
Surrender for the beauty of your lies
Just take my hand and let's stand by and by
