In Context
She said, these terminals once again
Wasp's nests, these terminals once again
These heart swells, these contexts in your head

Oh! Hell no, these vessels
Our heart swells up, these vessels
Our heart swells up, which make us explode

Oh! Hell no, these vessels
Our heart swells up, which welcome
These heart swells up, which make us explode

Oh, what the hell, we should have said no
Oh! Hell, we should have said no
Heart swells, which make us explode

She said these wasp's nests in your head
These wasp's nests, these contexts in your head
Once again

We could set it on fire for them
We could set it on fire for them
We could set it on fire for them
We could set it on fire for them

Oh! Hell no, these vessels
Our heart swells up, which welcome
These heart swells up, which make us explode

Oh! What the hell, we set it on fire
Oh! Hell, we set it on fire
Heart swells, which make us explode

Oh! Hell no, these vessels
Our heart swells up, these vessels
Our heart swells up, which make us explode

Oh! What the hell
We set it on fire
We set it on fire
We set it on fire
