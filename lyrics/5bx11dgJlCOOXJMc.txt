Hollow like my soul

You think that you'll get by
You will die
You will cry
When you think that you'll survive
Just don't try
Run and hide
My eyes are hollow like my soul

You think that you'll get by
You will die
You will cry
When you think that you'll survive
Just don't try
Run and hide
My eyes are hollow like my soul

Just as I was walking by
My soul died
My heart cried
When you think that you'll survive
Just don't try
Run and hide
My eyes are hollow like my soul

So many times I ask myself
So many times I wonder why
So many times I ask myself
So many times I wonder why

You think that you'll get by
You will die
You will die
When you think that you'll survive
Just don't try
Run and hide
My eyes are hollow like my soul
My eyes are hollow like my soul

Hollow like my soul
You think that you'll get by
You will die
You will cry
When you think that you'll survive
Just don't try
Run and hide
Run and hide
Run and hide
