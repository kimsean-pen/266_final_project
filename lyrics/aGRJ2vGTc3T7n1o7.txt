once there was one
once there was only one
a foot, a hand, a tongue
talking to no one
and no one made nothing
to ease the balance it split in two
the old line became creation
and we saw bodies forming
from rib and from monkey
half became the whole
a race of man and woman

woman and man
woman and man working together
i can show you, teach you something

if you listen, man and woman
woman and man working together

ocean and land
ocean is land covered with water
i can tell you, in my answer
if you listen, man and woman
ocean is land covered with water

killing for life
life is a fight, let's fight it together
i can teach, teach you something
if you listen, man and woman
life is a fight, let's fight it together
