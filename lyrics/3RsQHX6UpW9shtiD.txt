Love is a serious game
I don't know the rules you were playing
I gave you the keys to my heart
You tore it apart
And I never thought we'd end this
But you know that I can't stay

'Cause there's too many teardrops I've cried
I could have filled me an ocean
Now I'm leaving this heartache behind
I might be bruised but I won't be broken
'Cause too many teardrops I've cried over you
Over you

I'm not afraid of the fire
But I saw the flames getting higher
I know we started with sparks
But you pushed me too far
But I got my eyes wide open
And I have to walk away

'Cause there's too many teardrops I've cried
I could have filled me an ocean
Now I'm leaving this heartache behind
I might be bruised but I won't be broken
'Cause too many teardrops I've cried over you
Over you
