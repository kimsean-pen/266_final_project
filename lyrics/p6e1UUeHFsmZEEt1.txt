I'm going nowhere
I can't move forward
I'm so much colder than I've been
Since, say, October
When we were closer
And it was love that we were in

If I was a smarter man
I'd understand
I'm alone when I look in the mirror
We said our goodbyes but
I closed my eyes and
You're still here

I'm going nowhere
Just getting known there
Watching the whole world pass me by
Against better reason
I take memories and
Sit back and repeat 'em every night

Maybe I stayed too long
Overplayed this song
I don't mind, I'm inclined to agree
If I'm going nowhere
Then there is nowhere I'd rather be

I wonder if she remembers anything
The way that I do her
Wonder if pre-September ever was
The way we were

If I'm going nowhere
Then there is nowhere I'd rather be

I wonder if she remembers anything
The way that I do her
Wonder if pre-September ever was
The way we were
It's all a blur

I'm going nowhere
She said it's over
Still, I look forward to the Fall
Another October
I'm sorry I know you're
Expecting a less than sober call

And maybe you're right, I'm scared
It might go nowhere
It is making it hard to believe
That I'm going nowhere
And there is nowhere I'd rather be

If you could just show where
I can go nowhere
That's where I'd rather be
