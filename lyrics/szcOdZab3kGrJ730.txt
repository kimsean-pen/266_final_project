I know, know what's on your mind
And I know it gets tough sometimes
But you can give it one more try to find a reason why
You should pick it up, ooh, try it again

'Cause it's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might just work out this time
All right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might work out fine this time
All right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might just work out
'Cause it's not too late for that, too late for me

And I know I've been hurt before
And I know I really shouldn't give any more
But this time, this time things seem just a little different
When I look in your eyes, you know I can see that it's true
And I hear you say it's

All right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might just work out this time
All right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might work out fine this time
All right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might just work out
'Cause it's not too late for that, too late for love

Just when you feel helpless
Nothing left to say
Love will find us, past behind us
Then we're on our way

Time and time again I see, people so unsure like me
We all know it gets hard sometimes
But you can give it one more try
Find another reason why you should pick it up
Ooh, why, you should kick it up, ooh, try it again

'Cause it's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might just work out this time
It's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might work out fine this time

It's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might just work out this time
It's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might work out fine this time
It's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might just work out this time
It's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might work out fine this time
It's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might just work out this time
