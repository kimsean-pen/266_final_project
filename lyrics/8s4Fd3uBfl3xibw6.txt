Oh my heart, it's a fish out of water
Oh my heart, it's a fish on the rocks
and it bakes in the bad sun

Oh my heart, it's a rock in the gutter
Oh my heart, it's a rock and great boulder and stuck in the gutter

And I throw my heart back to the ocean
But it don't go far, it come back floating
And I watch it wash it up with the dead fish

But it ain't quite dead, it just is like this

Oh my heart, it's a house in tornado,
Oh my heart, it's a house in the sky in the eye of tornado
Oh my heart, it's a roof in El nino
Oh my heart, it's a roof made of straw in the jaw of El nino

And I pour my heart a new foundation
But it don't set hard, it just stays shaking
And I scratch my name, I scratch my name in
But it don't set hard, it gets mixed back in

Bam bam bam, bam bam bam, bam bam bam, bam...

Bam bam bam, bam bam bam, bam bam bam,
bam bam bam, bam bam bam, bam bam baaam...

Oh my heart, it's a fish out of water
Oh my heart, it's a rock in the gutter

Oh my heart, it's the black in a rainbow
Oh my heart, it's so damn so cold, so damn cold

And I throw my heart into the fire
'Cos I want to set my heart on fire
And I watch it try befriending embers
But the ice don't melt in mid-December

Oh my heart, it's a fish out of water
Oh my heart, it's a fish on the rocks
and it bakes in the bad sun
