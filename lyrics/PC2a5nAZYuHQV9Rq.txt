Dreaming in the daylight
'cause I know heaven is a world away
You were here sleeping on the floor
But this hell feels better with you
Working through the midnight
I know heaven is a world away
We're here sweatin' on the floor
But this hell feels better
Better with you
Better with you
Better with you
Better with you
This hell feels better with you
Better with you
Better with you
Better with you
This hell feels better with you
You're in my veins
You're in my blood
You stop the feeling of giving up
Oh I know we don't have much
Still this hell feels better with you
Better with you
Been waitin' here a long time
Maybe heaven ain't on its way
Well if we're stuck down here forever
At least hell feels better
Better with you
Better with you
Better with you
Better with you
this hell feels better with you
Better with you
Better with you
Better with you
This hell feels better with you
You're in my veins
You're in my blood
You stop the feeling of giving up
Oh I know we don't have much
Still this hell feels better with you
Better with you
