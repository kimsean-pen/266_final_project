I fathomed love the rest tonight
Change is all the rage
There are catapults
There are bare insults

I can see forever all these things
They are obvious to me

We are flawless proof
We are breaking loose
I am ready to expire in all directions
All this breaking news
Just keeps breaking you
We will keep it there for your protection

These happenings keep happening
And now movements aer making moves
There are fingerprints, subtle hints
There are things you cannot choose

I can see forever all these things
They are obvious to me

We are flawless proof
We are breaking loose
I am ready to expire in all directions
All this breaking news
Just keeps breaking you
We will keep it there for your protection

Honestly I never thought
Could ever be this great of cost
Openly I accept the separation cuts ~

We are flawless proof
We are breaking loose
I am ready to expire in all directions
All this breaking news
Just keeps breaking you
We will keep it there for your protection
