You gotta fight through the pain to get to the top
You gotta push through it all if it's what you want
Screaming "This is a call to the dreamers"
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believers

R.I.S.E., let's light a match and ignite the streets
Screaming "R.I.O.T.", but now it's time to give 'em something to say
So dig a little bit, never quit, keep on that hustle
Get up and take another hit, hold on through the struggle
Screaming "R.I.S.E.", let's light a match and ignite the streets
Let's light 'em up, light 'em up

You gotta fight through the pain to get to the top
You gotta push through it all if it's what you want
Screaming this is a call to the dreamers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believe
You gotta fight through the pain to get to the top
You gotta push through it all if it's what you want
Screaming this is a call to the dreamers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believers

The road is long, but it's the one to take
You gotta put in the work, it's time to make or break
Though the road is long, it's the one to take
You gotta put in the work, it's time to make or break

You gotta fight through the pain to get to the top
You gotta push through it all if it's what you want
Screaming this is a call to the dreamers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believe
You gotta fight through the pain to get to the top
You gotta push through it all if it's what you want
Screaming this is a call to the dreamers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believers

Make them believe
Write down your name in history
You gotta make them believe
One day they'll remember me
You gotta stand up tall, give 'em something to say
With you back against the wall, be somebody to hate
Make them believe
Write down your name in history

You gotta fight through the pain to get to the top
You gotta push through it all if it's what you want
Screaming this is a call to the dreamers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believe
You gotta fight through the pain to get to the top
You gotta push through it all if it's what you want
Screaming this is a call to the dreamers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believers

Make them believe
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believers
This is a call to the dreamers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believers
