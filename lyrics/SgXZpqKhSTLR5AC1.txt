I'm scared to like you, I'm scared to care
I'm scared because I don't think we're going anywhere
I'm scared to laugh at your jokes, scared to say you're cool
I'm scared that if I tell my friends
about you I'll look like a fucking fool
Look to the left, it's you in a cocktail dress
Wanna make this right
You're coming home with me tonight
Do I impress?
All your friends have jobs and BFs
I'm a lowkey mess
You're fragile, I'm stressed
Can I say baby?
I don't wanna be sloppy
But I like your style
Think you're kinda cool
I'm sorta into you
What does that make me?
I don't wanna be sloppy
But I think you're great
Wanna call you babe
Hope you feel the same
It makes me laugh that you think I'm sweet
It makes me laugh cause you hardly know me
It makes me cringe that I might like you more than you do
It makes me cringe that I'm writing this song about you
Look to the left, it's you in a cocktail dress
Wanna make this right
You're coming home with me tonight
Do I impress?
All your friends have jobs and BFs
I'm a lowkey mess
You're fragile, I'm stressed
Can I say baby?
I don't wanna be sloppy
But I like your style
Think you're kinda cool
I'm sorta into you
What does that make me?
I don't wanna be sloppy
But I think you're great
Wanna call you babe
Hope you feel the same
We argue, we fight
We only do it cause it's kind of nice
We french kiss, we bitch
But it's all gonna be alright
We say mean things
I snub your friends
We're bad for each other
But it'll all work out in the end
But it'll all work out in the end
Can I say baby?
I don't wanna be sloppy
But I like your style
Think you're kinda cool
I'm sorta into you
What does that make me?
I don't wanna be sloppy
But I think you're great
Wanna call you babe
Hope you feel the same
Can I say baby?
I don't wanna be sloppy
But I like your style
Think you're kinda cool
I'm sorta into you
What does that make me?
I don't wanna be sloppy
But I think you're great
Wanna call you babe
Hope you feel the same
