Slowboat takes me to your home every day
And I wait for you, knowing that you won't come home
Just today
For you've found someone new
And you've bid me adieu
And I leave you now
But I'll come back another day

Ooh, sail me far away
Slowboat, bring me back another day
Ooh, sail me far away

Slowboat, sail off toward the seventh sea
Far away from you, but somehow coming close again
And again
And again as we near
From some sign, it appears
That you won't come home
You won't come home just today

Ooh, sail me far away
Slowboat, bring me back another day
Ooh, sail me far away

Slowboat takes me where I'll always be
Far away from you
But knowing that you won't come near me
But you hear me
And you'll always be
A true love to me
Though you're never home
But I'll come back another day

Ooh, sail me far away
Slowboat, bring me back another day
Ooh, sail me far away

Ooh, sail me far away
Slowboat, bring me back another day
Ooh, sail me far away
Slowboat, bring me back another day
Ooh, sail me far away
