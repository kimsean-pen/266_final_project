The sun has left the sky
Now you can close your eyes
Leave the world behind until tomorrow
The dream is like a song
It leads you on and on
The piper plays his tune so you must follow

So far beyond the sky
Not knowing how or why
You realize this feeling is forever
And though another day
May steal your dreams away
You and the song will always stay together
