We're just a bird who fell to shore
No grace in how things end I know
But it's true
Some life does shine on through
Will we slowly reappear
Little walks until we're new?

Now in some car
I drive too fast
Outrace some memories, I guess
Yes I know, but love just won't let go
Can I slowly disappear
And drive like someone new?
Arms are hungry but they don't know
If you will come by here again
And the summer just whisper on
These sad songs must come to an end
It's my bird, I will let it go
Yes, I know
Aw, and then I won't sing no more

We're just a pattern in the wild
We line right up and tell the times
To not change
How can we remain
When sun and showers reappear
And this is how we grow
Arms are hungry but they don't know
If you will come by here again
And the summer just whispers on
These sad songs must come to an end
It's my bird, I will let it go
Yes I know
And then I won't sing no more

We're just a bird who fell to shore
I love you dear
Be safe, you know?
It's all true, life does shine on through
And these hours disappear
Like the skies that we once knew
