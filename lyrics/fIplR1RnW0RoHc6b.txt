There's an angel by your hospital bed
Desperate to hear his name on your breath
As he looks down you're not making a sound
Open your eyes look at me
I'll bring to you whatever you need
And I'll tell you I'm sorry
That I can't take this pain away from you
And I'd put it on my own body if I knew how to
Can't you see?

I've gotta bust you outta here somehow
I've never seen your heart this tired
I've never seen your spirit held down
I know that you say
This is what you get
For being a bad child
But I know this will be your reward
In just a little while
In just a little while

Its testing the strong ones
Scarring the beautiful ones
It's holding the loved ones
One last time
Its testing the strong ones
(testing the strong ones)
Its scarring the beautiful ones
(staring the beautiful ones)
Its holding the loved ones
One last time
Its testing the strong ones
(testing the strong ones)
Its scarring the beautiful ones
(scarring the beautiful ones)
Its holding the loved ones
One last time
Testing the strong ones
(testing the strong ones)
Scarring the beautiful ones
(scarring the beautiful ones)
Its holding the loved ones
One last time
