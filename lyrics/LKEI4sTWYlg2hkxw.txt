You get hotter then the cherry on a cigarette
Bet every dollar mom's a model but you're better yet.
She's twenty-one out on the run and turning every head
Your body's built just like a weapon and you're using it
But the devil can hear you when you say...

C'mon and get up (get up), move your body
Use your body, lose control.
Rub it right up, against my body
Use my body, make it yours. (So get up)
We're gonna light this room on fire
Ya, you and I will burn it up tonight (so get up)
The two of us will fuel this fire
No way in hell we're slowing down tonight

Then just for fun you take your tongue and run it over my lip
And gotta love the way she does it for the hell of it
We're in positions that most people only say they know.
You got your hand on a landmine, ready to blow
But the devil can hear you when you say...

C'mon and get up (get up), move your body
Use your body, lose control.
Rub it right up, against my body
Use my body, make it yours. (So get up)
We're gonna light this room on fire
Ya, you and I will burn it up tonight (so get up)
The two of us will fuel this fire
No way in hell we're slowing down tonight

You want me tappin' on your back door?
You got me tappin' on your back door, baby.
I got you actin' like you want more,
Now that I'm tappin' on your back door baby
And the devil can hear you when you say...

C'mon and get up (get up), move your body
Use your body, lose control.
Rub it right up, against my body
Use my body, make it yours. (So get up)
We're gonna light this room on fire
Ya, you and I will burn it up tonight (so get up)
The two of us will fuel this fire
No way in hell we're slowing down tonight
