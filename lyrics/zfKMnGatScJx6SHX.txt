So, come in, try to break my fall
Leaving, spitting sticks and stones
And I lie awake I don't know
This room won't lead me to an open door
But it's alright, cause I can't wait to see the trouble here tonight

And so wake up, it's just a little too late for conversations
It's just a bit too much ground for me to make up
But you'll give it all that you got now
Give it all that you got now
Give it all

Slow, I feel ya, wrapping round my bones
I call ya but you're never home
And am I a fool? I don't know
Just see me see them wear their silver tongue
But it's alright, cause I can't wait to see the trouble here tonight

And so wake up, it's just a little too late for conversations
It's just a bit too much ground for me to make up
But you'll give it all that you got now
Give it all that you got now
Give it all that you got now
Give it all that you got now
Give it all that you got now
Give it all that you got now
Give it all that you got now
Give it all that you got now
You should give it all

And so wake up, it's just a little too late for conversations
It's just a bit too much ground for me to make up
But you'll give it all that you got now
Give it all that you got now
Give it all
