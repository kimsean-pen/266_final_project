Bury the hatchet now

A fire's burning inside me
And the flames continue to grow
The rage is intensifying inside me
I'm spinning outta control

I know this is madness
But I can't get over it
I'm choking on a bitter pill
I can't seem to swallow it

Bury the hatchet now
Forgive and forget,
Or we all end up alone
Bury the hatchet now
Before it cuts deeper and deeper
Bury the hatchet now

The devil whispers in my ears
Revenge will show you the way
He plays a silent song
I can't let that be my fate

I know this is madness
But I can't get over it
I'm choking on a bitter pill
I can't seem to swallow it

Bury the hatchet now
Forgive and forget,
Or we all end up alone
Bury the hatchet now
Before it cuts deeper and deeper
Bury the hatchet now

I breathe in nothing but ashes
My heart has turned to coal
Ignite my soul
Let me go
I breathe in nothing but ashes
Why can't you just let me go?

Why can't you just let me go?
Let me go
Let me go

Bury the hatchet now
Forgive and forget,
Or we all end up alone
Bury the hatchet now
Before it cuts deeper and deeper
Bury the hatchet now

Bury the hatchet now
Forgive and forget,
Or we all end up alone
Bury the hatchet now
Before it cuts deeper and deeper
Bury the hatchet now

I breathe in nothing but ashes
Ignite my soul
