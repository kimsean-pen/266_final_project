In the mornin' it takes me quite a while to clear my head
And as the day moves on
I find it hard to smile at somethin' said

So I took control priority number one and that's me
That cut the dragons head off and put away my gun
So let it be, so let it be

I'm dyin' prematurely, I'm wastin' my life for sure
I'm tryin' to kill what's happenin' to me
A ghost along the Mississippi

Never thought before a life could be so strange, yeah
And I guess by one a day became ten or twelve more
And more and more and more

But I've got a gift it's somethin' called my friends or love
With them and I combined I'll beat an early end
It's been done before, it's been done before

Nothin' of passin' away or losin' just one more day
I'm tryin' to kill what's wrong with me, yes I'm
A ghost along the Mississippi

Can't happen to me, can't happen to me
Won't do it to me, won't do it to me no
Can't happen to me, can't happen to me
Won't do it to me no, won't do it to me, no, no

Can't happen to me, can't happen to me
Won't do it to me, won't do it to me no
Can't happen to me, can't happen to me
Won't do it to me, won't do it to me
Won't do it to me, no no

Lets go

Destroying whats got hold to me, yeah yeah
No more no ghost no Mississippi, yeah
