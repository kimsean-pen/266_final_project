My three sixty degree reality
Sunset beach I don't need HD TV
I want the real thing
Living off a dream
Gimmie couple thousands I'mma jet to Philippines

My three sixty degree ability
Visioneer lose the fear let there be reason
Give circulation to the nation we are one
Everything is fun under the sun
I just tell myself to fly

Fly, in the sun you'll breath
Fly, you do not need me
Fly, in the song you sing
Why you waitin'
Be the light

My three sixty dollars on the shelf
What's my wealth
I'm the best at bein' myself
I can tell you American dreams
Nice thing from the shop
But I really think that Asia's 'bout to pop

My three sixty five days on the wall
Live each day like my last
Green like paper over plastic
Wrap my head around the whole world is a blast
If ya open up to magic
I just wanna tell you fly

Fly, in the sun you breath
Fly, you do not need me to
Fly, in the song you sing
Why you waitin'
Be the light

I will rise with the tribe
I can feel your vibe from the other side

I will rise with the tribe
I can feel your vibe from the other side
