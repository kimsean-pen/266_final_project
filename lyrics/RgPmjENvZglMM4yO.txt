Aye, I Need Some Mo' Russians
I got big rocks jumpin' out my brand new Patek Watch
Ice ice baby, uh-huh, I got a whole lot
Niggas you's a nobody, you ain't got no bodies
These niggas they know 'bout it, these niggas know 'bout me
Step up on the scene
Diamonds bling, these hoes scream
Checkerboard Louie V
I'm so fresh and so clean clean
Stuff them bands in my jeans
Slap them thirties in them things
Pull the trigger, let it sing
Then go smoke a Russian cream
I got money blue and green
Drop them racks on double G's
Yeah, I'm a Gucci fiend
Feel like Tarzan, all these trees
I get so high I can't breathe
Like LeBron, bitch I'm a king
But I never leave my heat
Yeah, what the fuck you mean
Hop in and hear the exhaust
Hit the gas, watch me get lost
Tell that bitch keep on her drawers, yeah
Yeah, 'cause you know I want them jaws, yeah
No you can't text or can't call, no
I got a bitch at the house, yeah
Give that ho straight to my dawg, yeah
Dunk that ho like basketball, uh
You know I'm all 'bout my figures
Young nigga gettin' them digits
Young niggas goin' gorilla
I heard you be talkin' that peeler
Boy you know you not no killer
My chopper eat niggas for dinner
My diamonds is ill, make you shiver
This codeine is eatin' my liver
Uh, duh, I drink mud, yuh, pourin' just because
On my rose I spent a dub, yuh, shinin' like a bug
Buy that shit, don't give a fuck
Yeah this hustlin' in my blood
My heart cold, can't show no love
Yeah my grandma raised a thug
Yeah I bought them racks out
Everything I cashed out
Left the lot, I smashed out
Come get your boss and cash out
Get high 'til I pass out
From the back, she pass out
Pull her tracks, she tap out
Big Glock make her spazz out
Step up on the scene
Diamonds bling, these hoes scream
Checkerboard Louie V
I'm so fresh and so clean clean
Stuff them bands in my jeans
Slap them thirties in them things
Pull the trigger, let it sing
Then go smoke a Russian cream
