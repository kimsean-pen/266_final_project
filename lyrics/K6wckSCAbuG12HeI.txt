We took a walk that night but it wasn't the same
We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain
She said she loved me but she had somewhere to go
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I never let her go

Tell me what you wanna know
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
So come on, oh come on, oh come on
Oh oh oh

I know my rights, I've been here all day and it's time
For me to go so let me know if it's all right
I just can't take this
I swear I told you the truth
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I never let her go

Tell me what you wanna know
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
Then you whisper in my ear
I know what you're doing here
So come on, oh come on, oh come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
Oh oh oh
