This is my town
It's my town, it's my town, it's my town
This is my town
It's my town, it's my town, it's my town
This is my town

Yo, flood the scene, hit the strip, get my fix
Got some sniffles in the sack, run this town like a sprinter on the track
Come on, lay back to attack in the 'Lac
We ain't cutting no slack, girl, what you know about that?
I ain't trying to be your lover, but I gotta say
That we can keep it undercover when you wanna play
Blazed up, smoked out, out of my mind
We just cruise around my town all the time

When the sun goes down the stars come out like the ghosts of yesterday
So drink 'em down cause some things never change
Baby, sing it loud, we ain't gonna fuck around
When the sun goes down, let me hear you say

This is my town
It's my town, it's my town, it's my town
This is my town
It's my town, it's my town, it's my town
This is my town

If the city never sleeps, then, fuck it, neither will I
You know we keep it thirty-deep and we're as high as the sky
You can watch us thirty-creep as we just ride and we ride
You can watch the Fiesta drop from one side to side
We're breaking the boulevard cause we get it better
If ever you need to find me, bitch, you can send me a letter
Forever drunk and disorderly off this vodka I'm pouring me
Goddamn, man, I want it all, my city of glory

When the sun goes down the stars come out like the ghosts of yesterday
So drink 'em down cause some things never change
Baby, sing it loud, we ain't gonna fuck around
When the sun goes down, let me hear you say

This is my town
It's my town, it's my town, it's my town
This is my town
It's my town, it's my town, it's my town
This is my town

The streets you walk give you a reason
Cause it's all you got and that'll never change
So keep singing that song and we can live forever
Pour a little out for the ones who passed away

When the sun goes down the stars come out like the ghosts of yesterday
So drink 'em down cause some things never change
Baby, sing it loud, we ain't gonna fuck around
When the sun goes down, let me hear you say

This is my town
It's my town, it's my town, it's my town
This is my town
It's my town, it's my town, it's my town
This is my town
