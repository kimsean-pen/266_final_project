I like the sound of your heartbeat
Your pulse is pushing against me
I'm good when you are around
You keep me warm in your bloodstream
You keep me calm when you breathe in
Now I don't know what I've done

I've been trying but not enough
Please do not give up on us

I'm a wolf howling
In the moonlight, calling out
Like a fool
Howling on your doorstep, calling out

I hate that everything's different
My clothes, my haircut is different
But still I'm feeling the same
What is eternal about love?
If there's a way to turn it off
You know, so show me the way

But if trying could mean enough
You will not give up on us

I'm a wolf howling
In the moonlight, calling out
Like a fool
Howling on your doorstep, calling out
I'm a wolf howling
On your doorstep, calling out
