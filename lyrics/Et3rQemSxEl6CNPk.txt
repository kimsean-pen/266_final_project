Clinging to me
Like a last breathe you, would breathe
You were like home to me
I don't recognize the street

Please don't close your eyes
Don't know where to look, without them
Outside the cars speed by
I never heard them until now

I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there's trouble ahead, I can feel it
You are just saving yourself
When you hide it

Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way you stare
As if there was trouble ahead
And you knew it
I'll be saving myself from
The ruin
And I know you care

I used to run down the stairs
To the door and I thought
You were there
Do you shape trough the comfort of us?
Two lovers loved out of love

I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there's trouble ahead,
I can feel it
You are just saving yourself
When you hide it

Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way you stare
As if there was trouble ahead
And you knew it
I'll be saving myself from
The ruin
And I know you care

And know it wasn't always wrong
But I've never known a
Winter so cold
Now I don't warm my hands
In your coat
But I still hope

'Cause this is how things ought
To have been
And I know the worst it
Wasn't all that it seemed
Why can't I dream?
Why can't I dream?

'Cause I know you care
And I know you care
I know you care
I know you care
I know it's always been there
