Oh, London moon
Help me stumble home
Let me lose myself along the way
I've got nothing left, it's kinda wonderful
'Cause there's nothing there can take away, away

The open doors left me wanting more
Never thought they'd close them all the way
The ordinary life they want for you
Is it too much to have to bear?

But it's another way to win a useless fight
You've been lying so long, don't know when you're faking
See the water on the rise
Just another day into a useless night
I've been pushing so hard, now my hands are shaking
See the water on the rise

But I've been turned around
I was upside down
I thought love would always find a way
But I know better now
Got it figured out
It's a perfect world all the same

I've been turned around
I was upside down
I thought love would always find a way
But I know better now
Got it figured out
It's a perfect world all the same

I was hopin' for
An easy ramblin' life
Till the notion came to my mind

We look for exit signs
But we can't be changed
Into nothing overnight

Though we know it's over
It keeps exploding
Every morning when we rise
