I am not the girl they sing a song about
I'm the one who writes the story now

Follow me this is my town
I've been here for two hours now

Come speed up I have some cash
Come speed up to chase the stars
Or the sun is happiness
In your British mind

You and I, we're gonna be alright
They say that we only have fun
Don't you look away, don't you look away

I say, you and I, we're gonna be alright
They say that we only have fun
We can stand the pain, we can stand the pain

People say that failure is my middle name
But this mess is what turns into success

Guts and sparks is what I get
I'm all giving my soul away

Come speed up I have a plan
Come speed up I'm in the dark
Or the sun is happiness
In your British mind
