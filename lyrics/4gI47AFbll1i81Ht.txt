I'm on top of the world
And you can't bring me down
I'm on top of the world
With masses by my side
I have a dream
Eternal reign
I have godly power
You think you have a choice
I have godly power
Democracy has died
I have a dream
Eternal reign
I am darkness, I'm black light
Not an angel, but the devil in disguise
I am darkness, I'm black light
Not an angel but the master of your lives
I'm back alive
God is not on my side
It's only make-belive
God is not on my side
The funds is what I need
I have a dream
Eternal reign
On your knees I'm your god
You don't know it yet
On your knees I'm your god
You just don't know it yet
I have a dream
Eternal reign
I am darkness, I'm black light
Not an angel, but the devil in disguise
I am darkness, I'm black light
Not an angel but the master of your lives
I'm back alive
