Right now we both know
We're Marina del Rey
Plane's gonna fly away
And you'll be on it
And by this time tomorrow
I'll be singin' Yesterday

The sunshine's gonna fade
And we can't stop it
So before we turn in to
I can't make you love me

Let's be Brown Eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline
Free fallin' small town Saturday night
Before you Lose that Lovin' Feelin'
Let's go Dancin' on the Ceilin'
Keep on livin' that teenage dream

Paradise City where the grass is green
Pretty soon I'll be so Lonesome I Could Cry
But that's a song for another time

For just for one more day
What do you say
Baby be my Pretty Woman
Because we know Sunday Morning's Coming Down
And let's take a drive, you and I, down some old country road
Talk about growin' old in one of those Pink Houses
Yeah we might be a Candle in the Wind
But let's pretend we're

Brown Eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline
Free fallin' Small Town Saturday night
Before you Lose that Lovin' Feelin'
Let's go Dancin' on the Ceilin'

Keep on livin' that teenage dream
Paradise city where the grass is green
Pretty soon you will be always on my mind
That's a song for another time

Oh before we say I Will Always Love You
Let's sing Brown Eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline
Free fallin' small town Saturday night
Before you Lose that Lovin' Feelin'
Let's go Dancin' on the Ceilin'

Keep on livin' that teenage dream
Paradise City where the grass is green
Pretty soon I'll Be So Lonesome I Could Cry
But that's a song for another time
Ya that's a song for another time
(Brown-eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline)
Ya that's a song for another time
(Small Town Saturday Night)
That's a song for another time
