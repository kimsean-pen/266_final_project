I owe you nothing
I be myself and I ain't fronting, eh, nah, nah, nah
I owe you nothing
I be myself and I ain't fronting, eh, nah, nah, nah

I don't have to smile for you
I don't have to move for you
I don't have to dance,
Monkey dance, monkey dance, monkey dance for you

See, I won't help you understand
I don't need no helping hand, no
See, these aren't tears, this is the ocean
These aren't fears, this is devotion

I owe you nothing
I be myself and I ain't fronting, eh, nah, nah, nah
I owe you nothing
I be myself and I ain't fronting, eh, nah, nah, nah

I don't have to walk for you
I don't have to talk to you
See, I'm not on display
Never was, never will ever be for you

I won't help you understand
I don't need no helping hand, no
See, these aren't tears, this is the ocean
These aren't fears, this is devotion

Why you always have to try me?
You think that I'm gon' follow blindly
Why you always have to try me?
You think that I'm gon' follow blindly
Oh, let me down easy
Baby, let me down easy
Let me down easy

I owe you nothing
I be myself and I ain't fronting, eh, nah, nah, nah
I owe you nothing
I be myself and I ain't fronting, eh,
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nah
I owe you nothing
I be myself and I ain't fronting, eh, nah, nah, nah
I owe you nothing
I be myself and I ain't fronting, eh, nah, nah, nah
