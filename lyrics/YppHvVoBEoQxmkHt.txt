Blue for the blue, I feel
What I'm feeling down in the ground
Feeling down I can be most any day
Green for the ice, take a look around
When the sun goes down
And the sun goes down in the strangest way
Red for the light, gotta stop this thing
Find a song to sing that is everything
That I meant to say, I meant to say--

Green for the mice and I drawn like the world
Never see the good that's down the bad
It's too late to see
The two of us make it easier
To read the signs, memorize the lines
Won't you stay with me?
One for the road, I'll be on my way
Come another day when the things we say
Find a way to be, a way to be---

[Instrumental interlude]

Autumn calls for a change of year
Bringing winter near while spring's the ground
And the skies are fine
Wintertime is a razor blade
That the devil made, it's the price we pay
For the summertime
Spring day's come then it's hard to know
Where the rain comes from, where the children go
It's a nursury rhyme, a nursury rhyme----

ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahhhhh...
