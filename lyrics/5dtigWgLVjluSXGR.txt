Pen to paper with invisible ink
Displaying honesty with nothing to show
Recanting the taste of the knife
A sweet to bury me forever
We're trapped in casings made of arsenic and inclinations
Indigence from the heart trudging on so unfulfilled

I haven't been so much as thrilled to be alive
For I am cursed and holding on
To this semblance of a life

I cannot shake
The jinx that's applied
The haunts that encroach
A rain that won't dry
I'm drinking my options
And dying of thirst
The shadows still lingering
For I am cursed
The lights have been dim lit
The candles burned wet
No shelter to house this
A plague that cant set
A scratch at this ulcer
A prayer that it bursts
A longing for solace
For I am cursed

Mouth to bottle with a hunger for regret
Paralyzed in an infant state
Our feelings benumbed by our consumptions
Every kiss a coat to peel and flake
Habituation a crutch which once brought solace
Now choleric as there is no other choice
Cauterize the wounds which exposures
Smoldering ache which begat the vice

I've never felt such vapid space behind my eyes
For I am cursed and moving past
The orchestrator of these cries

I cannot shake
The jinx that's applied
The haunts that encroach
A rain that won't dry
I'm drinking my options
And dying of thirst
The shadows still lingering
For I am cursed
The lights have been dim lit
The candles burned wet
No shelter to house this
A plague that cant set
A scratch at this ulcer
A prayer that it bursts
A longing for solace
For I am cursed

I cannot shake
The jinx that's applied
The haunts that encroach
A rain that won't dry
I'm drinking my options
And dying of thirst
The shadows still lingering
For I am cursed
The lights have been dim lit
The candles burned wet
No shelter to house this
A plague that cant set
A scratch at this ulcer
A prayer that it bursts
A longing for solace
For I am cursed
