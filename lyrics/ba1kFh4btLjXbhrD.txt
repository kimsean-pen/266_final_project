Oh, I'm trying to let it go
Trying to keep my eyes closed
Trying to keep it like was before
The times we never even thought to speak
I don't wanna tell you what it is
But I felt so serious
Is got me thinking just too much
I wanna set it off, but
It's this one thing that's got me trippin
It's this one thing that's got me trippin (you did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did oh oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin
It's this one thing don't want to admit it (you did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did oh oh
Hey, we don't know each other well
Why do I keep picking up my cell
Memories just keep ringing bells
Oh oh, Oh oh, Oh
Hear voices I don't want to understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels are clicking towards your door.
Oh oh, Oh oh, Oh
It's this one thing that's got me trippin
It's this one thing that's got me trippin (you did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did oh oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin
It's this one thing don't want to admit it (you did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did oh oh
It's this one thing that's got me trippin
It's this one thing that's got me trippin (you did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did oh oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin
It's this one thing don't want to admit it (you did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did oh oh
(Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me
No, you don't mean nothing at all to me
Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me
No, you don't mean nothing at all to me)
