Walking the tightrope
Between good and evil
Like lambs to the slaughter
Staring into their own abyss

A war and a peace
A flock and a shepherd

The preachers of death
Awaken the dead
To a prison of belief

Vicious methods justified
Implanting the seeds of guilt
Say farewell to flesh and blood
Prepare for the sermon of lies

The preachers of death
Awaken the dead
To a prison of belief

The preachers of death
Guilty as charged
Awaken the dead
To a prison of belief
