Some of my best friends are girls
Drink drink water water while the world whirls
Around you

Some of my best friends are girls
Come on, I'm sure you're wrong
We will find one that you, belong to

And the more I drink with you
The more I see the mess she made
Pour yours down the drain
And we'll wrest away the mess she made

Crashing on my couch again
Rain rain drizzle drizzle while the room spins
Grey blankets forever

Drink drink water water in the moonlight
With me, alright, you'll see
That the world is full of self-erasing angels

And the more I drink with you
The more I see the mess she made
Pour yours down the drain
And we'll wrest away the mess she made

Cos maybe
You just need some time
To sober up your mind
And remember all the reasons to forget her

And maybe
The moisture on your sleeve
Will dry before you leave
So you can wear your heart back on your sweater

But the more I drink with you
The more I see the mess she made
Pour yours down the drain
We'll wrest away the mess she made (Vocalizing)
