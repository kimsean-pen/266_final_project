I got high john in my pocket
and mud in my shoes
walked all the way from mississippi
just to spread the news
don't care for idle conversation
I'm not your girl about town
but when it comes to make music
I run the voodoo down
and here in this quiet place I own
worlds are born
the night of my conception
the star were fixed
conjure woman told my mother
she's gonna run and twist
don't have to worry 'bout her learning
she's gonna get around
and when it comes to traveling
she'll run the voodoo down
here in this quiet place we own
we're born
destiny is my deliverance
I walk this road alone
I take my pleasure in remembering
I'm just a rolling stone
and I don't mind some company
if you want to stay around
but when it comes to my loving
I run the voodoo down
and here in this quiet place I own
worlds are born
