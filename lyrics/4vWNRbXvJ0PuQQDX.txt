I ain't goin back again to that state of mind where i was ignorant and it was war time
and i thought i could save all of us if i wrote one line yaknow the right line
and gettin by wasnt gettin by we had to steal and lie and some of us died
we were on borrowed time and the clock was tickin and theyre lookin at me and the move was mine

fuck it just tellem the truth
tellem no man can take nothin from you
tellem your skin is too thick and youll die about this
they dont possess the spirit you do
tellem your city is countin on you
if you go home with nothin theyll probably kill you
and this aint life or death for them
close your eyes and count to ten

honestly this is as honest as ive been
so ill try speaking to the public like were friends
truthfully i wish the very best for men
but you think freedom is money well money has an end
i aint goin back again

i aint goin back again to that dope house where we slept together cuz it was cold out
we had one jacket amongst all of us so we would take turns when we would go out
and the open oven heated the whole house and the mattress on the kitchen floor
with an AK 47 and 3 hand guns but we swore we needed more
cuz we were at war
where wed haul water by the bucket back to our home
and wed heat the water and wed talk for hours cuz we didnt have no phones
and wed dream together about a better life and houses and cars and clothes
and wed laugh and joke as we all showered from the same pan on the stove

fuck it just tellem the truth
tellem no man can take nothin from you
tellem your skin is too thick and youll die about this
they dont possess the spirit you do
after all the shit weve been through
id kill myself before i turn on you
and this aint life or death for them
close your eyes and count to ten

i aint goin back again to the time we thought that a record deal could save us
where we were unapproachable and desperate and we were dangerous
where our city would love us and think highly of us not hate us
cuz it didnt change a thing
i'm still David
i'm still KING
