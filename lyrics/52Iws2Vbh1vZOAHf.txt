I won't never be the same.
Since you left me to die
I'm on the floor, I decay, seen good in my eyes
As it poured down my face, and now I'm barely alive
There's no way I'll survive
I never Wanted this life but they say I'm the one
Will I land from the liquor
Or will I die by the gun
Will, I still have a time to see the ones that I love
Or they find me all alone
In a tub full of blood
Do you feel uncomfortable around me?
Act so strange to the ones who care
Walk in a room and they all surround me
Keep a smile on a face
Through the depths of despair
And I scream how I feel
Everybody hears but no one listens
It seems like I'm hopeless
Everybody sees but no one focus
I'm screaming for help
Every song think it's a lie
Now I need someone's hand
So when the time runs out
Don't say that you tried
Listen what I'm saying
Do you think this shit a joke
You won't think it's funny
Till I'm hanging from a rope
Then everybody crying
Saying that they was my bro
But everybody lying
I done seen it all before
People gone drink till the lake run dry
People gonna watch till they eyes catch fire
Nothing gone stop till we all realise
Nothing gone stop till we all get wise now

And I scream how I feel
Everybody hears but no one listens
It seems like I'm hopeless
Everybody sees but no one focus
I'm screaming for help
Every song think it's a lie
Now I need someone's hand
So when the time runs out
Don't say that you tried
