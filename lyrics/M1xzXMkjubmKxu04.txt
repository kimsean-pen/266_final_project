Born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me
Born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me
Born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me
Born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me

Let me tell you of a force crashing through my veins again
Like a page torn from a chapter of a book of better days
In the moments that we seize together some will never know
It's these words that never give true justice screaming all alone

I was born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me
Born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me

You may trust in the unanswered and put hope in the unseen
All our memories come haunt us if we still fail to believe
Now the fear we all once held is the breath we mustn't take
Because those who sow in flames, in ashes they shall reap

Ashes are all that you're left with when you sow in flames
Ashes are all that you're left with when you sow in flames
Ashes are all that you're left with when you sow in flames
Ashes are all that you're left with when you sow in flames

All life's sorrows of my own creation
The same is said for our love
All life's sorrows of my own creation
The same is said for our love
All life's sorrows of my own creation
The same is said for our love
Those who sow in flames in ashes they shall reap

I was born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me
Born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me
Born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me
Born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me
I was born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me
Born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
But those who sow in flames, in ashes they shall reap
Those who sow in flames, in ashes they shall reap
