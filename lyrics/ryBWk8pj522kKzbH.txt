I don't believe, I think I'm falling asleep
Is this beginning or ending? Am I stuck in a dream?
I don't want to know what I think, I suppose

Out of the light and into this time of demise
And there's a cross on the hill, the holy image of lies
I've opened my mind but this dream is still real

You don't need to worry, I'm just fine
I've just lost my mind

Tell me it's over
'Cause I don't feel a thing at all
No conscience, there's no more
Senses all have disappeared

Am I alright, alive tonight
Paranoid, am I too late
Am I alright, alive tonight
Crash and fall into this night with me

Look in my eyes, tell me I'm alright
I don't know if I'm still alive
If this is goodbye forever's just a lie
Big enough to make you wanna try

In just one life
How can we live enough to rest in peace?
In just one life
How can we live enough to rest in peace now?

Here as I stand head in hand
And one hand on my heart
As I depart it's not so hard
One day to become a man

You have your scars
But I never thought that you would give me mine
