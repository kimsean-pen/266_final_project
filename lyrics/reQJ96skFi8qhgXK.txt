Together we have discovered
The languid fatigue of love
Interrogated all our beauty
We've turned each other inside out
Drowning in ebony tears
The long face of cherrlessness
The only bonding we share
Enlightened by degredation
The only pleasure is pain
Drowning in ebony tears
Embedded in our resentment
Lay the keys to disengage
But still we burn in persecution
For the punishment of possessiveness
