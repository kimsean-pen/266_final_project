I've seen some places
And so many faces
But you look like home tonight
You crave attention
And I need affection
So let's walk the silver line

All you need is my, all you need is my love
I got a little bit left to give up
All I need is your, all I need is your touch
Baby that's all I'm asking of you

Dear lover
I'm incapable of saving your heart this time
But if you wanna
I'll pretend to be your hero for just tonight

I'll pretend to be your hero for just tonight

You've been believin'
There's more to this feelin'
I swear I wish there was
But when the moment is over
We'll walk away closer
Maybe that's good enough

All you need is my, all you need is my love
I got a little bit left to give up
All I need is your, all I need is your touch
Baby that's all I'm asking of you

Dear lover
I'm incapable of saving your heart this time
But if you wanna
I'll pretend to be your hero for just tonight

I'll pretend to be your hero for just tonight

All you need is my, all you need is my love
I got a little bit left to give up
All I need is your, all I need is your touch
Oh, baby that's all I'm asking of you, ooh

Oh, oh
Dear lover (lover, dear lover)
I'm incapable of saving your heart this time (incapable of saving)
But if you wanna
I'll pretend to be your hero for just tonight

I'll pretend to be your hero for just tonight
