Give me the tools I'm gonna build a fake you
Give me the tools I'm gonna build a fake you
Forget all the fights, I'll fill you with light
I'll die with a smile, but my heart will stay wild

I'm scared to break you, but I will never fake it
I'm scared to break you, but I will never fake it
Notice all the ways I wake when all the water sifts down
Later I will grow, later I'll be angry still

It's sin the way I dig my heels in
I left you in Brooklyn
Alone under the burning stars
But you're the broken wall I wail to
I'll shatter with the real you
No matter how fake you are

I got some calls from my better days
I got wrapped for what I shouldn't say
I got all the truth I needed from the belly of New York
You can look and never find the button that will give you a new song
I call the law when I feel lost
You'll be the clouds over slick moss
I'll tell you all my dreams if you promise me you'll stay here
And if you find me half dead you will cry with real tears

It's sin the way I dig my heels in
I left you in Brooklyn
Alone under the burning stars
But you're the broken wall I wail to
I'll shatter with the real you
No matter how fake you are

Give me the tools I'm gonna build a fake you
Give me the tools I'm gonna build a fake you
Give me the tools I'm gonna build a fake you
Give me the tools I'm gonna build a fake you
Give me the tools I'm gonna build a fake you
Give me the tools I'm gonna build a fake you
