I'd love to stay and party but I gotta go to work
I'd love to stay and party but I gotta go to work
I'd love to stay and party but I gotta go to work
Work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work
I hear you laughing but I don't think it's funny
What good can happen spending other people's money
But, you better get a job
It was adorable when you were in your 20's
Not so cute anymore now that you're pushing 30
You better get a job
But you never know, I was gonna go
...end up tomorrow
You gotta try, try, try, try, try
I know it's hard, but you never know
How it's gonna go, end up tomorrow
You gotta try, try, try, try, try
Girl, you gotta get a job
Oh girl, you need to work real hard
Just turn your head down, but when I ask you for the rent
Poor little rich girl, you don't know where the money went
You need to get a job
What kind of life is it, when everyday's a weekend
How quickly we forget when I'm at work you're sleeping in
You need to get a job
But you never know, I was gonna go
How it's all gonna end up tomorrow
You gotta try, try, try, try, try
I know it's hard, but you never know
How it's gonna go, end up tomorrow
You gotta try, try, try, try, try
Girl, you gotta get a job
Oh girl, you need to work real hard
I'd love to stay and party but I gotta go to work
I'd love to stay and party but I gotta go to work
I'd love to stay and party but I gotta go to work
Work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Who's gonna hire you with you lack of experience
Who's gonna wire you, the last of your inheritance
Girl, you gotta get a job
Oh girl, you need to work real hard
But you never know, I was gonna go
How it's all gonna end up tomorrow
You gotta try, try, try, try, try
I know it's hard, but you never know
How it's gonna go, end up tomorrow
You gotta try, try, try, try, try.
