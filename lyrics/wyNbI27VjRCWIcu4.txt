I want your love, feel the hole in my heart
I want the whole 9 yards, feel the hole in my heart
I need your love, I want the whole 9 yards
Feel the hole in my heart, I want your whole 9 yards

Reason whole worlds gotta know
I'm just a whore with no matching clothes
Stain your lips on this, memory of satin sheets
Hot in here, come here, get away, no you should go

I want your love, feel the hole in my heart
I want the whole 9 yards, feel the hole in my heart
I need your love, I want the whole 9 yards
Feel the hole in my heart, I want your whole 9 yards

Eat you whole, from toes and arms to ears
Give me all your blood, sweat, dreams and tears
Leave you high and dry, don't cry my love will go
Hot in here, come here, get away, no you should go

I want your love, feel the hole in my heart
I want the whole 9 yards, feel the hole in my heart
I need your love, I want the whole 9 yards
Feel the hole in my heart, I want your whole 9 yards

Reason whole worlds gotta know
I'm just a whore with no matching clothes
Stain your lips on this, memory of satin sheets
Hot in here, come here, get away, no you should go

I want your love, whole in my heart
Whole in my heart...

I want your love, feel the hole in my heart
I want the whole 9 yards, feel the hole in my heart
I need your love, I want the whole 9 yards
Feel the hole in my heart, I want your whole 9 yards
I want your love, feel the hole in my heart
I want the whole 9 yards, feel the hole in my heart
I need your love, I want the whole 9 yards
Feel the hole in my heart, I want your whole 9 yards
