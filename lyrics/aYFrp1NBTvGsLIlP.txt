Before you hedge those bets you placed against me
be reticent of fortunes they foretell.
Your verbal defecation I can't wash away despite my self.
Your vanity it seems has served you well.

You're so quick to choose the path walked by the righteous
so you can go and nest among the weak.
And the innocent observers will refuse to find the lie within
renew the disappointment of the meek.

You're no Jesus Christ!
You're no Jesus Christ!

Put the gun in my mouth and pull the trigger
I feel so alive here.
Put the gun in my mouth, it tastes so bitter.
I feel so alive here.

You're no Jesus Christ!
You're no Jesus Christ!

You keep taking over
I keep rolling over
I can't take it any more.

You keep taking over
I keep rolling over
I cant take it any more.
