I call your name but you're not there
Was I to blame for bein' unfair?
Don't you know I can't sleep at night since you've been gone?
I never weep at night, I can't go on

Don't you know I can't take it?
I don't know who can
I'm not gonna make it
I'm not that kind of man

Don't you know I can't sleep at night?
But just the same
I never weep at night, I call your name

John
John

Don't you know I can't take it?
I don't know who can
I'm not gonna make it
I'm not that kind of man

Don't you know I can't sleep at night?
But just the same, yeah
I never weep at night, I call your name
I never weep at night, I call your name, yeah
