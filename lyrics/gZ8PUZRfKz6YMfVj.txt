Come on baby,
Won't you show me what you got there
I want your salvation, whoa [x2]

There's a neighborhood called blackhawk
where all the rich people hide
I was down on my luck working for the salvation army
The shelter is where I reside
Everyday we drive into blackhawk
and we pick up the offerings
Microwave, refrigerator for the suffering

Come on baby,
Won't you show me what you got there
I want your salvation, woah [x2]

I can't believe these people live like kings
Hidden estates and diamond rings
I'm a rat out on a mission
I'm in your front yard under suspicion

Come on baby,
Won't you show me what you got there
I want your salvation, woah [x4]

I can't believe these people live like kings
Hidden estates and diamond rings
I'm a rat out on a mission
I'm in your front yard under suspicion

Come on baby,
Won't you show me what you got there
I want your salvation, whoa [x6]
