Female voice three: Trying to watch TV.
Unplugged the telephone.
Can't be there.
Calling my mom to pick me up.
Taking the train out to the countryside.
All those people on the central station.
Mom is telling me to take pills if I feel bad.
Vidar is picking us up at the station.
It's raining and really windy.
Pitch black outside--we are driving through darkness.
I take the bike down to the lake--swim
out to the raft in the middle of the lake.
The water smells like iron.
I spend the whole night there.
I borrow a boat and row out into the lake.
I watch the sunrise.
I spend the next night out on the lawn.
It's a warm night.
I forgot to pack so I wash my jacket
and green military pants in the lake.
I walk around the island in the morning.
Have completely stopped sleeping...
Once back home I write Arve long letters.
Repaint my apartment in bold colors.
Listen to music.
Buy gifts for those I like,
wrap them all in shiny paper,
and give money to anyone asking in the streets.
I get to know a new person every day, it's that simple.
Everyone has something to say to me,
all the blue eyes in ganla stan [?] for example.
All that heat.
Blazing fires and helicopters on the front page of the news.
There's a war going on and I'm marching in heavy boots.
