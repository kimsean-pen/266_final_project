Hey, yeah
Here come the jesters, 1 2 3.
It's all part of my fantasy.
I've got the music
And I'll have to see the crowd.
Dancing in the eyes,

And singin' out loud.
Here come the dancers, one by one.
Your momma's callin' but you're having fun.
You find your dancin' on the number 9 cloud.
Put your hands together now, and sing it out loud.

It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy.
Yeah
It's all part of my rock and roll dream.
Yeah

Ooh, yeah
Aah
It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy.

It's all part of my rock and roll dream.
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Put out the spotlights, one and all,
And let the feelin' get down to your soul.
The music's so loud, you can hear the sound

Reaching for the sky, churnin' up the ground.
It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy.
It's all part of my rock and roll dream.
It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy.
It's all part of my rock and roll dream.
Yeah
Fantasy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fantasy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
