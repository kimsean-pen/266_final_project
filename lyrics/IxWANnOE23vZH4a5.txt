You can't talk to anyone
Because you might get cut off
You get these strange signals
Are they abstract memories
Or are they warnings

Your senses are sending you a message
Can you identify the source

You can't hear the voice on the other end
The ringing in your ears is louder than him
Or maybe you just don't like what he's saying
Or is your mind deceiving you again

Your senses are sending you a message
Can you identify the source

And your eyes have spells
You can fall over in the street
When your point of view
Tilts ninety degrees

Put on the music as loud as it goes
But you still can't hear it
You can't turn down the sound between your ears
It sounds like ocean waves crashing on the shore
