Half awake, deprived of sleep and dignity
I stand before the blinding lights
My body trembling, survival instincts gasp for air
Rays of madness tear the nights in me

Torn from the slumber, like a drunken king
To watch the cities burn
The world I used to see, no longer a part of me
In bleak reflections, stripped of my humanity

Yet I have all to gain
The slate is clean
And all the "why's" I need
The stakes are high
The wheels of fate have turned
The chariot awaits
And I will set the course
On paths of tribulation
A refugee of reason

In a world of disbelief
Outnumbered by the thousands
Empowered by the ones I seek
Yet I have all to gain

The slate is clean
And all the "why's" I need
The stakes are high
The wheels of fate have turned
The chariot awaits
And I will set the course
On paths of tribulation.
