Fall down into the chaos
Staring into the depths of pain, darkness and suffering
I will not be moved
From this place, inside of me
Until I understand
This part of me that bleeds and captures my spirit
If it's the death of me, then I will loosen its grip

Protect me
From the hell that burns inside me
No one can see
This is the hell in me
The hell in me

Bring light into the darkness
Awaken and stir this war within us all
Reveal my true intentions

No one can see
This is the hell in me
Will you set me free? (Set me free)
This is the hell in me

Lead me out of the darkenss
Strengthen and protect the voice that makes no sound
Suffer and bleed for me
Pulled from the hell that is in me
(Set me free)
(Protect me)

Set me free
Protect me (protect me)
From the hell that burns inside me
No one can see
This is the hell in me
Will you set me free?
This is the hell in me
