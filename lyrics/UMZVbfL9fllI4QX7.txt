We said some things we didn't mean
With us there is no inbetween.
From where we're standing I think we both know
Maybe we're better off alone.
Under the bridge on Castle Street,
We wrote our names in the concrete,
But it's so different now and we both know
Maybe we're better off alone.

No light, light. No light, light.
Daylight gone.

We've got fire on our tongues
We've got no air left in our lungs,
And if we're done, then I'll come.
I feel love, I feel love.
When did our hearts turn to stone
Is all that's left just skin and bone?
And if we're done, then I'll come.
I feel love, I feel love.

Trying to climb these narrow stairs
We stop ourselves from splitting hairs.
Maybe it's time that we gave up the ghost,
Maybe we're better of alone.

No light, light. No light, light.
Daylight gone.
No light, light. No light, light.
Take me home.

We've got fire on our tongues
We've got no air left in our lungs,
And If we're done, then I'll come.
I feel love, I feel love.
When did our hearts turn to stone
Is all that's left just skin and bone?
And if we're done, then I'll come.
I feel love, I feel love.

We've got fire on our tongues
We've got no air left in our lungs,
And if we're done, then I'll come.
I feel love, I feel love.
When did our hearts turn to stone
Iss all that's left just skin and bone?
And if we're done, then I'll come.
I feel love, I feel love.

We said some things we didn't mean,
With us there is no inbetween.

--------HIDDEN TRACK-------

I'll wait 'til your eyes go to sleep
And don't pray that mine fall down.
Watch your skin steal the warmth out of me.
'Til I shiver.
And the hours roll by like the sea,
We always said we had more.
Watch you just swell and sink as you breathe
We're together.

Tonight ... your tired eyes.
And we'll lay here as one, as we wait for the sun.
I'll wait forever.

And the morning it breaks with the sun
Through the slither of light it allows
But I won't wake you.
