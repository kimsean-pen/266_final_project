Calm sort of feeling
They're all turned to gray
The days much colder and there's not much left to say
Tried to stop from shaking
Want to feel you close
You kept your distance when I needed you the most
The sun was bright, it never shined
I know you're mine
But still I cry
It makes no difference
If you turn away
No hope for me now
Better off that way
Only left a moment
That's all it took
No sound for me now
Foundation shook
Burned down thes
Burned down the town
Forget tomorrow, no one's around
Searched all the ditches
And all the sounds
That's why tomorrow
Won't come around
The sun was bright
It never shines
I know you're mine
But I still I die
There's no... hope
No... hope.
No... hope.
For the wicked inside myself
No.hope
for the the wicked or the good
No.hope
For the wicked inside myself
No.hope
For the wicked or the good
