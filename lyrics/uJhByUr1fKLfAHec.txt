Ah, youve got such understanding ways
I believe everything that you say
Smiling faces not forgotten cause
I love you

When I think of all the things weve done
And we havent even yet begun
Smiling faces not forgotten cause
I love you

Just for a little while
Oh, just to see you smile
Just for a little while

Youve got such understanding ways
Oh, I believe, I believe every word that you say
Smiling faces not fogotten cause
I love you
