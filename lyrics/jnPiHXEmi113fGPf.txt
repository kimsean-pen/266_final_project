I stand, looking at my hands
I talk with these lines
That's not the answer
I cry and now I know
Looking the sky
I search an answer

So free, free to be
I'm not another liar
I just want to be myself
Myself

And now the beat inside me
Is a sort of a cold breeze and I've
Never any feeling inside
Around me
Bring my body
Carry it into another world
I know I live
But like a stone I'm falling down

Damned, looking into the sky
I can feel this rain
Right now it's falling on me
Fly, I just want to fly
Life is all mine

Some days I cry alone
But I know I'm not the only one
I see that another day is gone
I don't wanna die
Please be here when I arrive
Don't die, please

And now the beat inside me
Is a sort of a cold breeze and I've
Never any feeling inside
Around me
Bring my body
Carry it into another world
I know I live
But like a stone I'm falling down

And now the beat inside me
Is a sort of a cold breeze and I've
Never any feeling inside
Around me
Bring my body
Carry it into another world
I know I live
But like a stone I'm falling down

Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
