Baby I need a hand to hold tonight
And one bright star to remind me
How dear is this life
Baby I've never known anyone like you
There's something very special about you
I can't imagine living without you

It's the way of the world and its motion
And no ocean can keep us apart
When the moment is right
And you're holding me tight
You capture the beat of my heart

In my heart there's a fire that's burning
And there isn't a thing I can do
I'm resigned to the fact
That there's no turning back
And I'll never regret loving you

Baby, I will go anywhere you lead
As long as you're there beside me
Baby that's all I need
Hold me, hold me and never let me go
I'm always gonna care about you
Oh, I never wanna be without you

It's the way of the world and its motion
And no ocean can keep us apart
When the moment is right
And you're holding me tight
You capture the beat of my heart

In my heart there's a fire that's burning
And there isn't a thing I can do
I'm resigned to the fact
That there's no turning back
And I'll never regret loving you

You're everything I believe in
So don't ever lose the feeling
Don't ever lose that feeling

It's the way of the world and its motion
And no ocean can keep us apart
When the moment is right
And you're holding me tight
You capture the beat of my heart

In my heart there's a fire that's burning
And there isn't a thing I can do
I'm resigned to the fact
That there's no turning back
And I'll never regret loving you

It's the way of the world
The way of the world
(The way of the world)
It's the way of the world
Hmm, the way of the world
It's the way of the world
Hmm, hmm
The way of the world
It's the way of the world
Yea, way of the world
(Ooh)
It's the way of the world
(Aah, aah)
The way of the world
It's the way of the world
