And I see your face
And it left me
Broken slaved
How you've chained me
Broken

Strong armed by your
Lustful greedy ways
I'm frozen here
Because you make me stay
You said that I would fail
Your intent was clear
Infectious piece of skin

And I'll face the fear

One more shot
Shot call in a riot
We'll burn it down
Burn it down
Fuel thrown on the fire
You're gasoline

Break from this fight
I can't live here
Broken
Raged
How you've kept me
Broken
I'm gonna stand on the
Edge and spit on you
Your end is near
We're chasing after you
No fault my hands are clean
Now you can disappear
We'll bring you to your knees

And I'll face the fear

One more shot
Shot call in a riot
We'll burn it down
Burn it down
Fuel thrown on the fire

One more shot
Shot call in a riot
We'll burn it down
Burn it down
Fuel thrown on the fire
You're gasoline

We'll burn it down

Go ahead and hide
Behind your A.K.A.
You're just as lost as
The ones you leave behind
I can be fixed
But first I'm gonna stand
And watch you fall

I'm having a hard time breathing
I'm having a hard time being
All the things I'm supposed to be being
I'm having a hard time breathing

One more shot
Shot call in a riot
We'll burn it down
Burn it down
Fuel thrown on the fire

One more shot
Shot call in a riot
We'll burn it down
Burn it down
Fuel thrown on the fire
You're gasoline
