I love you and I need you
Nelly, I love you, I do
Need you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you

Uh-uh-uh-uh
I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me
And she got the hots for me, the finest thing my hood done seen
But oh no, oh no, she got a man and a son, though,
But that's okay
Cause I wait for my cue and just listen, play my position
Like a shortstop, pick up everything mami hittin'
And in no time I plan to make this one here mine and
That's for sure
Cause I-I never been the type to break up a happy home
But there's something 'bout baby girl, I just can't leave alone
So tell me ma, what's it gonna be
She said, you don't know what you mean to me

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you

Uh-uh-uh-uh
I see a lot in your look and I never say a word
I know how niggas start actin' trippin' out here about they girls
And there's no way Nelly gon'
Fight over no dame, as you can see,
But I, I like your steeze, your style, your whole demeanor
The way you come through and holler, and swoop me in his two-seater
Now that's gangsta and I got special ways to thank ya,
Don't you forget it
But it ain't that easy for you to back up and leave him
But you and dirty got ties for different reasons
I respect that, and right before I turned to leave
She said, you don't know what you mean to me

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you (Put your hands up)

No matter what I do (Put your hands up)
All I think about is you (Yeah, Yeah)
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you

Sing it for me, K!

And I love you (Word?)
And I need you
Nelly, I love you, I do (C'mon girl)
And it's more than you'll ever know
Boy, it's for sure
You can always count on my love
Forever more, yeah, yeah
