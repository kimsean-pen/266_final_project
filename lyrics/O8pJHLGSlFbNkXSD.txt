After all your dreams are done and paid for
When there's nowhere left to run and nobody worth staying for
And though I hate to be the one to baer such news
Seems like you're set to be the only one to lose

Little one, how can it be
You hurt yourself but do not see
And everything you're breathing for
Will let you down and leave you sore

I was bound to the bed post
I was doing everything I could to make a change
Caught a sigh of indifference
When a certain feeling struck so strange
While it was my wish to keep you from such pain
I regret to say my efforts were in vain

Little one, how can it be
You hurt yourself but do not see
And everything you're breathing for
Will let you down and leave you sore

You're sad, sad
Can't go without
You do it to yourself
So you can save your doubt

Little one, how can it be
You hurt yourself but do not see
And everything you're breathing for
Gonna let you down and leave you sore

Little one, how can it be
You hurt yourself but do not see
Your friends will hang you out to dry
They'll scrape your knees
And baby make you cry

Everything you're breathing for
Will let you down and leave you sore
Little one, how can it be
You hurt yourself But do not see
