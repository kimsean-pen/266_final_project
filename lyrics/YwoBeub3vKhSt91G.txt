The sick get sicker while the rich get richer
Capital greed paired with vestigial superstition
The sick get sicker while the rich get richer
Angels and demons, money and munitions

Your left wing clipped, buy a gun for Jesus
Opportunities for all those willing to pay
Out of sight and out of mind
Too afraid of the horror that you might find
Out of sight and out of mind
How much does your faith cost?

Celestial shepherd watches over his flock
What about those black sheep that he forgot?
Unanswered faith is everything that they've got
I'd like to think you're everything that I'm not
Unanswered faith is everything that they've got
You're everything that I'm not
Something here doesn't add up
Something here doesn't add up
I'd like to think that you're everything
You're everything that I'm not

The sick get sicker while the rich get richer
Capital greed paired with vestigial superstition
The sick get sicker while the rich get richer
Angels and demons, money and munitions

Your charity starts and ends at home
Your conscience called, but you hung up the phone
