Nobody know that little spot that I know
Nobody get you hot like that, they too cold
Nobody get your dumb, dumb, dumb little jokes
Nobody know you like I know you, no

I'm good at loving you
So good at touching you
I'm not some mister, I know everything
I'm just good at loving you, loving you babe

Nobody get me dancing on the table like you do
Nobody get me crying like a baby like you done
Nobody make me run, run, run for the truth
Nobody know me like you do, do, do

You're good at loving me
So good at touching me, yeah
You're not some missy, I know everything
You're just good at loving me, loving me babe

Let's try again (let's try again)
Forget our friends (forget our friends)
Cause they don't know, no, no, no
They just pretend

I'm good at loving you
You're good at loving me
We're not those people who know everything
We're just good at loving each other, babe
Let's focus on our strength
Yeah
Let's focus on our strength

Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

I'm good at loving you
I'm good at touching you
I'm not some mister, I know everything
I'm just good at loving you, loving you babe
