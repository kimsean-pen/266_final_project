"A Little More"

Right about the time I missed your call I lost my mind
The drugs were off
It's raining where I am, I hope I see the text you sent
And don't get soft

Because I can't stand to be alone
When the buzz starts wearing off

Can I get a little more
Can I get a little more
From you-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
From you-oo-oo-oo-oh-whoa
Can I get a little more
Can I get a little more from you

That's me sitting in the bathroom with the lights off
Nobody knows the kind of stuff I gotta to fight off
I wash my sins away but I can't get the white off
What made you ever think you could take the night off

I can't stand to be alone
When the buzz starts wearing off

Can I get a little more
Can I get a little more
From you-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
From you-oo-oo-oo-oh-whoa
Can I get a little more
Can I get a little more from you

And I don't know who else to call
You're leaving me between the walls
You fake me out, you say you care
You break me down, I go nowhere
And I don't know who else to call
You're leaving me between the walls
You fake me out, you say you care
You break me down, I go nowhere

Can I get a little more
Can I get a little more
From you-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
From you-oo-oo-oo-oh-whoa
Can I get a little bit, a little bit
I said can I get a little little little bit more from you
Can I get a little bit, a little bit
I said can I get a little little little bit more from you

Can I get a little more
Can I get a little more
From you-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
From you-oo-oo-oo-oh-whoa
Can I get a little more
Can I get a little more from you
