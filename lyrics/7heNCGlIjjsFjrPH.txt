Oh
How quickly I come undone
Like melting ice on the sun
Why would that stop when I'm falling free
In a midnight daydream
Oh
You watch me and I'm exposed
Like lightning bolts in my bones
Why would that stop when I'm falling free
In a midnight daydream
Oh

Midnight daydream

Midnight daydream
Oh
How quickly I come undone
Like melting ice on the sun
Why would that stop when I'm falling free
In a midnight daydream
Oh
You touch me and I explode
Like lightning bolts in my bones
Why would that stop when I'm falling free
In a midnight daydream

Midnight daydream

Midnight daydream
