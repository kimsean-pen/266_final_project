Here we are in a world of corruption
Human nature is of violent breed
Who cares if there's no tomorrow
When I die for my future's laid out for me
Can't you see?

Rise
Above the lies

Moral's on a backwards globe
A sin to you, for me it's hope
It's my life and provision
Black or white some pay to pray
You question why they act this way
It's their fucking decision!

No more judgement day
Only tranquility
Peace signs, protest lines
Mean nothing to me

Honesty
Born in me
Heresy

I know what's right or wrong
And my belief is stronger than your advice
People, they go to war
Because religion gives them reason to fight, sacrifice
Die for pride

A group that caters, no one's fees or synthetic deities
Is where I belong
My stand is the human race without a label or a face
So they can lick my sack

No more judgement day
Only tranquility
Peace signs, protest lines
Mean nothing to me

Honesty
Born in me
Heresy

Honesty
Born in me
Heresy
