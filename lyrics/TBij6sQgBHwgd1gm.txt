Well I'd like to say, "enough, I didn't know."
I thought you said I was always unbelievable
Or is it the same when you're malfunctioning?
Pretty sure it'd be the same thing, I didn't mean.
Things you said for love
You should have more pride right?
Can you just imagine? (Can you just imagine?)
Things you said for love
