Gimme love, gimme love
Never enough
Gimme love, gimme love
Never enough
Gimme love, gimme love
Never enough
Gimme love, gimme love
Never enough

My hands reached out to touch the earth
I'm too small to reach to it
I can't quite reach the thing I want
All I touch is just dirt

Gimme love, gimme love
Never enough
Gimme love, gimme love
Never enough
Gimme love, gimme love
Never enough
Gimme love, gimme love
Never enough

Latched together from some loose box
Run from the wicked this life imports
Closed off from the seeing world
Inside my heart, inside a girl

[?] I don't need the time
I've wasted a life for contempt hopes
The one thing real I hunger for
I wish there was a little more

Gimme love, gimme love
Never enough
Gimme love, gimme love
Never enough
Gimme love, gimme love
Never enough
Gimme love, gimme love
Never enough

Gimme love
Gimme love
Gimme love
Gimme love
Gimme love
Gimme love
Gimme love
