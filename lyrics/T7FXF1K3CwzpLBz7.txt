I got that feeling
That bad feeling that you don't know
I don't even know her but I hope that she comforts you tonight

Nobody here that keeps you in the shade and ever owned you
Some sentimental tears or someone else's girl that drips away

But I somehow slowly love you
And wanna keep you the same
Well, I somehow slowly know you
And wanna keep you away

I got that feeling
That bad feeling that you don't know
I don't even know her but I hope that she comforts you tonight

And I somehow slowly love you
And wanna keep you this way
Well, I somehow slowly know you
And wanna keep you away

Away

And I somehow slowly love you
And wanna keep you this way
Well, I somehow slowly know you
And wanna keep you
But I somehow slowly love you
And wanna keep you the same
Well, I somehow slowly know you
And wanna keep you away
