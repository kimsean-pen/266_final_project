Didn't hear what they say
I was looking away
A sharp scratch away from knowing
It's a hell of a fright
But I'll be out like a light
Is there blood on my brain tonight
Maybe we're better not knowing
But the pain sticks around it's not going
Won't you help me to see what's to come
Sharp scratch and blood will come
Sharp scratch and blood will come
But I'll be alright
I'll be out like a light
This time tonight
We'll be alright
We'll go down with a fight
Is there blood on my brain tonight
Maybe we're better not knowing
But the pain sticks around it's not going
Won't you help me to see what's to come
Sharp scratch and blood will come
Sharp scratch and blood will come
