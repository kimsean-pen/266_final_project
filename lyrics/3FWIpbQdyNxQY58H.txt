Astoria I'm warning you
Not ready yet, not for you
Don't want to know my darkest lows
My blackest pitch, murder of crows
Feels far from home close to the veil
Goodbye mother's fairy tale
Never after will suffice
When star-crossed lovers take their life

Now where again, a harlequin
Kaleidoscope in spite of when
Top of the world
To lowest worth
From blackest pearl to slow rebirths
Don't remind me what the price is
When left to my own devices
'Cause I'll find out in all due time

What happens to never say die

I'll say whatever doesn't make me stronger kills me
But it's going to be a long year
Till the hospital can find hope in me
Tell me I survive
Do I survive you Astoria
Tell me I survive
Do I survive you Astoria

Do you know everything happens
It happens in threes

A fever blur through names obscured
And speech is slurred
What's another bridge burned
I'm on my own you came alone
All dressed up in bad news
I know you can hurt too
This would be the wrong move
Maybe we should leave soon
You can lay with me while you think of him
Drowning sorrows deep in each other's skin
I touch your face while I think of her
I won't raise my lips till the way we were
Bite my neck till you say his name

I will scratch your back to forget her face
I regret sweet, to a solemn cure
We can raise our lips till the way we were

On a good day I'm the bad news
For the wrong girl with the right wounds
On a bad day I'm the good news
For the wrong girl with the right wounds
Hey ever just say fuck it
Maybe I'll drink this song away in buckets
Oh hey might as well say fuck it
I want to hurt myself until I love it
I shoulda known you're not alone
When you take somebody home

And the little death
Are a little less even if its just for a moment
Hey lets all say fuck it
I'm gonna make my mother so proud of it

Hope doesn't fade in Astoria
I'll say whatever doesn't make me stronger kills me
Buts its going to be a long year
Till the hospital might find hope in me
Astoria
Astoria
Hope the melody save me Astoria
Let the melody save me Astoria
The quid pro quo's that will compose
From esoteric to common prose
Astoria
