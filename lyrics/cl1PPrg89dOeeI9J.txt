I know it's late
I shouldn't call at this hour
But it's my fate
I need lips to devour

My nervous system is shot all right
I won't sleep unless you

Sleep with me tonight...
Deep, with me tonight...

I know it's late
We've known each other a while
But I can't wait
To see your twisted smile

Kindred spirit of candle light
I won't sleep unless you

Sleep with me tonight...
Deep, with me tonight...

And my thoughts seal my sight
I'm so tired, but I fight

Sleep with me tonight
Sleep with me tonight

Drown out the machinery in my head
Bring your peace of mind to my bed
Without sleep, there are no dreams
Without dreams, we fall apart at the seams

Kindred spirit of candle light
I won't sleep unless you

Sleep with me tonight...
Deep, with me tonight...

And my thoughts seal my sight
I'm so tired, but I fight

Sleep with me tonight
Sleep with me tonight
Sleep with me...
Sleep with me...
Sleep with me...

Sleep with me tonight
Sleep with me tonight
