Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me
Off of my feet
And I'm back in the rain
Oh, you are on dry land
You made it there somehow

You're a big girl now
Bird on the horizon, sittin' on a fence
He's singin' his song for me
At his own expense
And I'm just like that bird
Oh, singin' just for you

I hope that you can hear
Hear me singin' through these tears
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh, but what a shame
That all we've shared can't last
And I can change, I swear

Oh, see what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
You've known it all the time
I'm learnin' it these days

Oh, I know where I can find you
On, in somebody's room
It's a price I have to pay
You're a big girl all the way
A change in the weather
Is known to be extreme
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
And I'm going out of my mind
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart
