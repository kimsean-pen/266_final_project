See if you can spot this one

What will you do when you get lonely?
No one waiting by your side
You've been running hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

Layla
Got me on my knees
Layla
Begging darling please
Layla
Darling won't you ease my worried mind?

Tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down, Layla

Got me on my knees
Layla
Begging darling please
Layla
Darling won't you ease my worried mind?

Make the best of the situation
'Fore I finally go insane
Please don't say we'll never find a way
Tell me all my love's in vain

Layla
Got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging darling please
Layla
Darling won't you ease my worried mind?
