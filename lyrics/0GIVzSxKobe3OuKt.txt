My throat was stunned
My mouth was so numb
Banned from making noise
I was not hurt
All calmly

My throat feels stunned
I was not allowed
I was not hurt
There is vocal sadness
I was separated
From what I can do
What I'm capable of

Need to break off
These chains some day
Do something I haven't done
I haven't done before

Vow of silence
I'll explore the negative space
Around my mouth
It implodes
Black hole

With jaw fallen in
In fallen jaw
Jaw fallen in
I am not hurt
I am not hurt
I am not hurt

This tunnel has enabled
Thousands of sounds
I thank this trunk
Noise by noise by noise
I have followed a path
That took sacrifices
Now I sacrifice this scar

Can you cut it off
