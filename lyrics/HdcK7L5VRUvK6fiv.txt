Never been the type to leave much room for anyone to speak
Always been about what I want
Listen to me while I preach
Never been the kind to make much space for emotions in a fight
Anything I didn't wanna hear, I just preached 'til I was right
But you, you got me on the line
Told me that you think it's time
Make a change or this is gonna stop
Shape up, before you drop me like a call
Now I wanna write a love song even though you never ever asked me for one
Write you letters and sweet poems
Ask for forgiveness, tell you I was wrong
Sit myself down, leave my pride and start to focus, change who I've been
Give me a second let me U-turn
Write you the love song you've earned
I've been at this so long I can barely stand to think it now
Every second of my life push back until I broke them down
I've been selfish so long I don't know why you would ever stay
Every minute you've been here I've been pushing you and your love away
But you, you got me on the line
Told me that you think it's time
Make a change or this is gonna stop
Shape up, before you drop me like a call
Now I wanna write a love song even though you never ever asked me for one
Write you letters and sweet poems
Ask for forgiveness, tell you I was wrong
Sit myself down, leave my pride and start to focus, change who I've been
Give me a second let me U-turn
Write you the love song you've earned
Every time I think I touch you all I have to do is think through
What I want, list your virtues, apologise, I don't deserve you
Any time I know I touch you all I have to do is run through
What I need, list your virtues, aplogise I don't deserve you
Now I wanna write a love song even though you never ever asked me for one
Write you letters and sweet poems
Ask for forgiveness, tell you I was wrong
Sit myself down, leave my pride and start to focus, change who I've been
Give me a second let me U-turn
Write you the love song you've earned
Give me a second let me U-turn
Write you the love song you've earned
