We are not like all the rest
You can see us any day of the week
Oh come around, sit down, take a sniff, fall asleep
Baby, you don't have to speak

I'd like to show you where it is
But then it wouldn't even mean a thing
Nothin' is easy, baby, just please me
Who knows what tomorrow may bring?

If for just one moment
You could step outside your mind
And float across the ceiling
I don't think the folks would mind

Who knows what tomorrow may bring?
Who knows what tomorrow may bring?
Who knows what tomorrow may bring?
Who knows what tomorrow may bring?
Who knows what tomorrow may bring?

Who knows what tomorrow may bring?
Who knows what tomorrow may bring?
Who knows what tomorrow may bring?
Who knows what tomorrow may bring?
