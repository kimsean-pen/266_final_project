Hush now, don't explain
There ain't nothin' to gain
I'm glad that you're back
Don't explain

Quiet, baby, don't explain
There is nothing to gain
Skip that, the lipstick
Don't explain

You know that I love you
And what love endures
All my thoughts are of you
For I'm so completely yours

Don't want to hear folks chatter
'Cause I know you cheat
Right and wrong don't matter
When you're with me, my sweet

Hush, now, don't explain
Don't you know
You're my joy and you're my pain?
My life is yours, love
Don't explain

All my thoughts are of you
For I'm so completely yours
Don't want to hear nobody chatter
'Cause I know you cheat
Right and wrong don't matter
When you're with me, my sweet

Hush, now, don't explain
You're my joy and you're my pain
My life is yours, love
Don't explain
