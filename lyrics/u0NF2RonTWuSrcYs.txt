I don't belong here
Not in this atmosphere
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

I don't belong here
Not in this atmosphere
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

Started with a kick and a punch
A claw to the face
And I was in the race
I was in the race
Yeah!
Yeah!

You know it's hard sometimes
Being humankind
Keeping up with the pace
Keeping up with the pace
Yeah!
Yeah!

I'm sick of running
Sick of running
Sick of running
The human race
The human race

If it's an eye for an eye
Then we all go blind
Is it hard to see?
Is it hard to see?
Yeah!
Yeah!

So far behind
No finish line
It could happen to you
It could happen to me
Yeah!

I don't belong here
Not in this Atmosphere
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

I don't belong here
Not in this Atmosphere
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

Started with a kick and punch
A claw to the face
And I was in the race
I was in the race
Yeah!

The human race
I'm sick of running
Sick of running
Sick of running
The human race
The human race

I don't belong here
Not in this atmosphere
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
I don't belong here
Not in this atmosphere
I don't belong here
Not in this atmosphere
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
