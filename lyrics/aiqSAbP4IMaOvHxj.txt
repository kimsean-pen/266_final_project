Hey, man, now did you hear?
Your final days are near
In a free fall of fire and ice
And explosions in the sky

A fate, yeah, that we deserve
There's no escape, no
Now it's your turn

Now it's your turn
It's been years
Since our luck ran out and left us here
Like broken mirrors
Ten million shards of glass and tears
But now we are
Awake enough to shatter what we hate
Like broken mirrors
Reflections of an unfamiliar face

Hey, hey!

Hey, man, you got the time?
Can I trouble you for a light?
Who, me? no, I'm not the old town crier.
I'm the one who sets it all on fire!

A fate, yeah that we deserve
And there's no escape, no
Now it's your turn

Now it's your turn
It's been years
Since our luck ran out and left us here
Like broken mirrors
Ten million shards of glass and tears
But now we are
Awake enough to shatter what we hate
Like broken mirrors
Reflections of an unfamiliar face

We hide from the mirrors
They might show our scars
(Don't want your scars) And hear us
Reflection that we want to be
The people we are (the people we are)
Defend your reflection
Smash what you see
And let's restart
'Cause mirrors
Can't see our heart
It's been years
Since our luck ran out and left us here
Like broken mirrors
Ten million shards of glass and tears
But now we are
Awake enough to shatter what we hate
Like broken mirrors
Like broken mirrors, yeah!
Like broken mirrors
Like broken mirrors
Like broken mirrors
Reflections of an unfamiliar face
