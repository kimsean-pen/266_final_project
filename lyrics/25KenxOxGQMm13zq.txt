When everybody else refrained
My uncle Johnny did cocaine
He's convinced himself right in his brain
That it helps to take away the pain
Hey, Johnny
Hey what you say Johnny

I wanna go out tonight
Come a little closer to the city lights
Levitation aint your only friend
Levitation coming back again
Feel a burning in your body's core
It's a yearning that you cant ignore
Now I wanna go out tonight

S-s-superman and hold on tight
He's convinced himself right in his brain
That it helps to take away the pain
Hey, Johnny
Hey what you say Johnny

My appetite aint got no heart
I said my appetite aint got no heart
Shocking people when you feel that pull
Shock 'em, drop 'em when you know its full

I feel a burning in your body's core
It's a yearning that you cant ignore
I gotta go out tonight
Hey Johnny I got faith in you man
I mean it, it's gonna be all right
He's convinced himself right in his brain
That it helps to take away the pain
Hey what you say Johnny

Tell us what's going on
Feel's like everything's wrong
Hey what you say Johnny
If the future is real
Johnny, you've got to heal
Hey what you say Johnny

When everybody else refrained
My uncle Johnny did cocaine
