None of us are innocent
We take what we can get
It doesn't matter if it hurts, I get back down
Greedy little prodigies
Disposable celebrities
Another social disease, another pitiful now

Don't talk, he just won't listen
Don't worry, oh you gotta wait and see

I'll get what's coming to me
Thank God it's over
I'm gonna get what's coming to me
Now that the worst is over
I'm gonna get what's coming to... me!

Bleeding up the bitterness
Balance your common sense
Why am I the only one who's never afraid?
I never wanted to eliminate
A generation that can't be saved
Don't believe it, you're the fucking ones to blame

Don't try, it just won't happen
Don't worry, oh you gotta wait and see

I'll get what's coming to me
Thank God it's over
I'm gonna get what's coming to me
Now that the worst is over
I'm gonna get what's coming to me
Thank God it's over
I'm gonna get what's coming to me
Now that the worst is over
I'm gonna get what's coming to me

I'm gonna get what's coming to me
Thank God it's over
I'm gonna get what's coming to me
Now that the worst is over
I'm gonna get what's coming to me
I'm gonna get what's coming to me
I'm gonna get what's coming to
