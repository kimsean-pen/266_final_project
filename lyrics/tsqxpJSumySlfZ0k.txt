As a kid I'd see the ships
Slowly taking shape
Nightshift riveters and caulkers
Keeping us awake
My dad worked at Swan
In the Neptune Yard
Worked the slipways in all weather
7.30 start
Call me up boy
Sit you down by the fireside
Spend some time
All the pride boy
And the tears
Tears enough to fill the Tyne
Gleaming vessels
Filling up the sky
Dwarfing rows of terraced houses
Larger than life
Tell me what do you do
When what you did is gone
No one throwing you a lifeline
How do you carry on?
(Call me up boy) Call me up
(Sit you down)
Sit you down! (By the fireside spend some time)
Time
And he said
(All the pride boy) All the pride
(And the tears)
And the tears (Tears enough to fill the Tyne)
The Tyne
So much larger than life
From father to son
We carry it on
It isn't going change the world
It isn't going to change the past
'Cause some things are meant to last
So much larger than life
From father to son
We carry it on
Call me up boy
Sit you down by the fireside
Spend some time
All the pride boy
And the tears
Tears enough to fill the Tyne
Fill the Tyne!
Fill the Tyne
The Tyne
