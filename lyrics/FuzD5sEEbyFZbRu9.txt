If the sun don't shine
If the worlds don't fell
If the oceans rises
our love will survive
our love will survive
I don't wanna see you cry
So baby let me tell your eyes
I'll be by your side
If the world stop spinnin round
and heaven falls to the ground
I'll be by your side
If the sun don't shine
If the worlds don't fell
If the oceans dry
our love will survive
if the sky falls down
If time rounds out
When the drump beats out
our love will survive
Into the lightning
fursting and fighting
let don't pardom me
look child civilations sweet thruth the nations
but your love is all I see
I don't wanna see you cry
So baby let me tell your eyes
I'll be by your side
If the world stop spinnin round
and heaven falls to the ground
I'll be by your side
If the sun don't shine
If the words don't fade
If the oceans dry
our love will survive
if the sky falls down
If time rounds out
When the drump beats out
our love will survive
If the sun don't shine
If the worlds don't fall
If the oceans rises
our love will survive
if the sky falls down
If time rounds out
When the drump beats out
our love will survive
