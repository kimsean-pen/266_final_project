I must be tough
I must behave
I must keep fighting
Don't give it up
I want to keep us compromising (oh-uh)

Open your arms and pray
To the truth that you're denying
Give into the game
To the sense that you've been hiding

Where are you taking me?
I can't be blamed
I want you to want me again

Is it desire?
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire
'Cause your love only gets me abused

Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh

Give me that rush
I want to show you what you've been missing
Am I enough?
To keep your other lovers hidden?

Where are you taking me?
I can't be blamed
I want you to want me again

Is it desire?
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire
'Cause your love only gets me abused

Is it desire (is it desire)
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire
I wanna see what you're willing to lose

Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh

You know that you've got me
You've locked me down
You tell me you want me
You need it now

You know that you've got me
You've locked me down
You tell me you want me now

Is it desire? (is it desire)
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire (I want desire)
'Cause your love only gets me abused

Is it desire? (is it desire)
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you? (I'm feeling for you)
I want desire
I wanna see what you're willing to lose
Oh, what you're willing to lose

Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh

Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh
