You had the most
Before you ghost
Sighing smokes are proof
I had to stop calling on you

Here is your exit
For all that had X, yeah
Never had exes
Never met a man who loved as I loved him, oh

And then I met you
I'll never forget you
I never met the kind of heart
That loves without tearing apart

I need
I'm sure
This kind of love is not for me to have
Don't get to take
This promise forcing me to hide away
Forcing me away

Let's take it back to the start

I don't think
I'm sure
This kind of love is not for me to have
Don't get to take
This promise forcing me to hide away
