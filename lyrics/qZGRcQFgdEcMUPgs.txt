No more pushing, let's go and build a car,
We're ready for the fly-past, another slow film.
Waiting for a minor change, at last the scenery,
Always saving up to listen to some fiction,
Try to buy a castle but there's no windows left,
I don't mind a breakout but there's never enough time.

Whatever you are saving for,
At least know what you're waiting for.

Don't try pushing, we'd rather buy a car,
Just waiting for the pictures in some line.
It's an easy catch in a courtyard when you're trying too hard,
Always waiting up in case the patterns break,
Try to catch that look that the others left,
I don't mind a breakout but there's never enough time.

Whatever you are saving for,
At least know what you're waiting for.

Don't try pushing, we'd rather buy a car,
And all the girls in Manchester couldn't steal a car.
Medieval crosses out but it catches you in time,
Always waiting up in case there's another invasion,
Try to buy a castle but there's no windows left,
I don't mind a breakout but there's never enough time.

Whatever you are saving for,
At least know what you're waiting for.
