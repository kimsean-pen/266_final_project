How could I ever go back
Back to the life
Where I lived amongst the dead?

How could I ever go back
To live amongst the dead?

Those who have forgotten how to feel, how to feel
And become slaves to memory and wishful thinking
But Your love has set me free
As You've awakened every star
That has been sleeping
In the constellation of my soul

How could I go back
To live amongst the dead?
How could I go back
To live amongst the dead?
How could I go back
To live amongst the dead?
How could I go back
To live amongst the dead?

Those who imprisoned beauty
I never want to leave Your arms
So I wait in hope for Your embrace
For Your embrace
I wait in hope for Your embrace
I wait in hope for Your embrace

Illusions of what I thought was love
Illusions of what I thought was love
Now I have clear sight to see I've left nothing behind
