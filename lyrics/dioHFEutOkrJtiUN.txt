Stop, wait a minute
Tell me what you're thinkin'
Baby, I don't know you so well
I'll put my heart in it (in it)
Hold me for a minute (minute)
Baby, I would never lie to you (lie to you)

Hold me close, tell me why
Put me in your bed at night
I wanna stay here forever
Hold me close, but don't you lie
Put me in your dreams at night
I shouldn't tell you this

You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams

Somedays I try to call
You never seem to fall for me at all
Baby, why you so cold?
I'm standin' at your door
Don't understand why you ignore my love
It is so warm for you

And you're the boy of my dreams
It's not so hard to see why you're the one for me
I love you so dearly
You're the boy of my dreams
It's not so hard to see why you're the one for me
I love you so dearly

You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
(You're the boy, you're the boy)
You're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams
