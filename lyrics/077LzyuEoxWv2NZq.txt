A carnival for the human race
Cotton candy, happy face
A child talking with his mouth full
Girlfriend gets stuffed animal

A festive mood is all around
Another world is what we've found
Step right up, let's make a deal
Ride the Ferris wheel

You know there's something lurking underneath the shape
With a mask over his head and make up on his face
Will Warner Brothers put our record on the shelf?
Take a look in the mirror and see the clown in yourself

If you want to know what's behind the show
You ride my carousel and enter life's jail cell
Love and blood begin to meld, you've lost the self that you once held
Merry go round your head - awake, asleep, alive or dead.

The clown that painted a smile on you
Is now the one unmasking you
Animated scenes unwind
Dormant figures come to life

Entangled in your own web
A twisted tunnel overhead
A glimpse of light, a drop of dew
You slide into the swimming pool

A roller coaster ride into the rivers of your mind
The currents merge, your feelings surge, your life's a pantomime
Beauty is the spiral going round & round the beast
Without the vampire effect, the carnival is deceased

Fun.
(Round and round she goes)
Roly poly.
Topsy turvy.
Hang upside down.
Fall to the ground.
I think I'm going to be sick.
