My eyes turn black as pitch
My gaze grows bleary and dull
Doze my prisoner of sleep

In my rooms, rime with frost
My heart is frost and slow
It's snowing in my soul
Empty, the halls of my heart
Candle burns, flicker and fade

I am gone with the autumn wind
I am come with the winter's gloom
Murdered by the darts of light
Born of the great big blue
I am of the dream of life
I am come with the winter's gloom
Oh the light of bygone time
Born of the great big blue

I'm crouched by the cradle of time
Hidden, by dark woods
Concealed by the roots of trees
Under a mount of moss
My heart is frozen and slow
It's snowing, in my soul
Empty, the halls of my heart
Candle burns, flicker and fade

I am gone with the autumn wind
I am come with the winter's gloom
Murdered by the darts of light
Born of the great big blue
I am of the dream of life
I am come with the winter's gloom
Oh the light of bygone time
Born of the great big blue

I am of the stuff of stars
Of the light of bygone time
I am of the wish of death
I am of the dream of life
