Beneath the frame I witness
Enter the pages of sin
Gold to the tough he feels to me
Body's lingering longer
Inhaling slowly he begs me free
On his knees to die with pride
Tools rust away upon the table
Nothing will stop this brutal killing
Step by step I stalk my victim
Learning his every move
Scarily he waits and begs for life
Burying him slow is the only pleasure
Extract the soul in a particular way
Soul and his mind gets washed away
Comply to my needs and I'll end your pain
Comply to my needs to the only terror

He's begging to die alone
"Please end my life"
I will have my way
Limb by bloody limb
Battered and bruised he begs again
Limb by limb I'm thinking still
Devoid of belief, death is his need
Devoid of sympathy I smile at him
Torturous within the mind

I'm blackened deep inside
Shattered within I search for hope
Purify my needs alone
Soulless being in a cloudy sky
Fade to black, I hide inside
Lost to pain i find the truth
These darkened skies are fading slow
Torturous ways within the mind
I'm blackened deep inside
Shattered within i search for hope
Purify my needs alone
Soulless being in a cloudy sky
Fade to black, I hide inside
Lost' to pain I find the truth
These darkened skies are fading slow

Inhaling slowly he begs me free
On his knees to die with pride
Tools rust away upon the table Nothing will stop this brutal killing
Extract the soul in a particular way
Soul and his mind gets washed away
Comply to my needs till I end your pain
Comply to my needs to end the torture
End the torture! Torturous ways... End the torture!
