You can wash out your lying eyes
In that bathroom down the hall
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
I guess I didn't know you at all

But I can picture you inside some stranger's house
Inside some stranger's bed
You're trying to seem mysterious
The covers pulled over your head

It's all right, lady liberty
It's just too bad you couldn't do the same for me

You say you've been used, you've been betrayed
Yeah, and that old bed's been newly made
You just stick around awhile with me
Until you're strong enough to leave

'Cause I can picture you the first time
You decide to spend the night
You wonder if you should give me a call
And ask me if it's all right

Yeah, it's all right, lady liberty
It's just too bad you couldn't do the same for me

Don't call me or send me any more letters, baby
I just can't stand to see your hand writing things that you don't mean
I waited, our faded love growing even more faded
The shades were down, I faced the wall, and I could hear you breathing

I tried to bring us back to life
I gave my heart so many times
And was it worth it after all?
There is a bathroom down the hall

There's a bathroom down the hall
There's a bathroom down the hall
And I guess I didn't know you at all
I guess I didn't know you at all

Lady liberty, liberty, liberty
Maybe it's time to leave
