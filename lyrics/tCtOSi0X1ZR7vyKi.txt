See the way the wind blows
Lives are intertwined
Watch the way the world goes
The man deals out our plight
Jester in the corner
Laughs without a sound
Jester in the corner
Malady abounds
In our souls
See the way the sun sets
Twilight of this life
The man is making little bets
Playing with our lives
All that I believe now
Anything is possible
A simple explanation
For the evil in this world
And in our souls
In our souls
Hoo hoo, go!
Come down to sorry and sable
It's always the man
Always keeping you down
Bow down cause I see it before me
Shadow and light
That always keeps you running
Oh-oh
Shut up, you talk too much
Oh-oh-oh
Pay the man now yeah
Oh-oh
Shut up, you talk too much
Oh-oh-oh
Look at you and your struggle for freedom
But you ain't nothing
We all pay the man for liv-ing
Wouldn't it be nice for a change now
To be unchained?
My life is for me now
But this is life
This is life
Pay the man (No!)
It's the man (No!?)
Oh-oh
Shut up, you talk too much
Oh-oh-oh
Pay the man now yeah
Oh-oh
Shut up, you talk too much
Oh-oh
Hoo hoo, go!
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh (Don't!)
(No!) Oh-oh-oh (Stop! No!)
Oh-oh
Shut up, you talk too much
Oh-oh-oh
Pay the man now yeah
My life is for me
Oh oh oh
Uno dos tres cuatro cinco cinco seis
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy
