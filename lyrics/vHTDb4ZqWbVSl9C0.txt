And then i drift far, and wither so hard
I'm distant... i fade, so far now... away
And then i... drift so far
I'm fading... sink so hard
My eyes fade, sink hard, so frozen, so far
The wind beats... and i, drift so far... then slide
I don't think that i will ever feel the same
And i don't think that this day will ever fade
I'm so frozen and so caught up in this day
I'm so frozen and so lost in this cold day
