There's a bullet in my pocket burning a hole
You're so far from your weapon
And the place you were born

There's a bullet in my pocket burning a hole
You're so far from your weapon
And you want to go home

I try to give you whiskey
But it never do work
(Try to give you whiskey, but it never do work)
Suddenly you're begging me
To do so much worse
(Suddenly you're begging me to do so much worse)

I knew it from the get go
The bullet was cursed
(I knew it from the get go the bullet was cursed)
Ever since I had you
Every little thing hurts
(Ever since I had you every little thing hurts)

You wanna get up? Let go?
I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?

You wanna get up? Let go?
I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?

You dream of seeing fire in them hills
But you better wipe that smile from your lips
Which of us will be the one to go?
(Which of us will be the one to go?)
He who hits the road's the one who lives
(He who hits the road's the one who lives)

You wanna get up? Let go?
I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?

You wanna get up? Let go?
I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?

There's a bullet in my pocket burning a hole
It's so far from your weapon
And the place you were born

There's a bullet in my pocket burning a hole
You're so far from your weapon
And the place you wanna go home

You wanna get up? Let go?
I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?

You wanna get up? Let go?
I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?

You wanna get up? Let go?
I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?

You wanna get up? Let go?
I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?
