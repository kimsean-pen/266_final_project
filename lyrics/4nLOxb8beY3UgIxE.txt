The high and mighty, they have fallen
On a road to hell, paved with good intentions
When you were alone, were the voices calling?
Telling you all the things too dark to mention

I know the right way
I know the right road to take
I may get lost on my way
But I'll get back on the right road today

The high and mighty, they have fallen
On a road to hell, paved with good intentions
When I am all alone and the devil's calling
Whispering things too dark to mention

I know the right way
I know the right road to take
I may get lost on my way
But I'll get back on the right road today

Get up, off the ground
Get up, keep on moving up
Get up, get up off the ground
Get up, strap your boots on now

I know the right way
I know the right road to take
I may get lost on my way
But I'll get back on the right road today
I know the right way
I know the right road to take
I may get lost on my way
But I'll get back on the right road today
