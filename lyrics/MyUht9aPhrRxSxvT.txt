You are my angel
Come from way above
To bring me love (To bring me love)

Her eyes
She's on the dark side
Neutralize
Every man in sight

Love you, love you, love you

Love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you...

You are my angel
Come from way above
Love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you...
