I know you wanna see me
You love the things I do
So go ahead believe me
Let's get the message through

You haunt my dreams by midnight
A never ending spell
So put me on a night flight

And outta this poison well

'Cause I can't deny it
Can't just get it through
I'm head over heels
Up to my neck in you
Obsessed with the thought
Of all the things we could do
'Cause I can't refine it
Can't just get to you
I'm head over heels
Up to my neck in you
Surviving the days when
You said we were through

Then you cut me loose
Down at West Ruth Avenue

No rest for broken hearted
In obsessions twisted rain
Spiking drinks under the moonlight
The dancing stars feel no pain
You blow the brakes and serve yourself

No matter what I say
Rockin' mouths and play guitars at noon
And Stevie Nicks in my head

'Cause I can't deny it
Can't just get it through
I'm head over heels
Up to my neck in you
Obsessed with the thought
Of all the things we could do
'Cause I can't refine it
Can't just get to you
I'm head over heels
Up to my neck in you

Surviving the days when

I thought we were through
Then you cut me loose
Down at West Ruth Avenue

'Cause I can't deny it
Can't just get it through
I'm head over heels
Up to my neck in you
Obsessed with the thought
Of all the things we could do
'Cause I can't refine it
Can't just get to you
I'm head over heels
Up to my neck in you
Surviving the days when
You said we were through
Then you cut me loose
Down at West Ruth Avenue
