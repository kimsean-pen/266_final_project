I was walking in my sleep, I met a man who
Couldn't dream
It's hard to believe
He said, 'I been losing confidence in a loop
Of existence
If you know what I mean'
Lifetimes passing by
Feels like we fall behind
Waiting for a sign, can anybody help me?
Where did you go?
Somebody help me
Oh no, you're on your own
Left in the afterglow
It was obvious to me
In his hands he held the key, just not like it
Seemed
I said, 'brother let me help you out
You just got to lose these doubts if you want
To be free'
And suddenly it all became clear
He could see himself floating up from the
Void
The sky opened up and swallowed him
Whole
And he wasn't afraid, in fact he welcomed it
His mind was made
No longer just another passenger, not just
Another man
Or a card in a deck
Not just another soldier marching to a
Monotonous drum
He's not just another.
