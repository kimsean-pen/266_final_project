Look at me
I swear that you refuse to talk about this thing
You're holding all the answers up inside your head
Say you think you're better off
Yeah, the water got to rough
Yeah, you don't love me enough
No, no

You said, I'm a mess and I've been hurting
I'm asking if it's worth it
Just say you see the purpose, ah yeah
You said, I'm a wreck and I've been nervous
And I've been losing focus
Said you could be my person, ah yeah

You say colors run, but I don't see it
And I'm apologizing for no reason
Nothing ever comes out how I mean it
I don't think I deserve this, ah yeah
I don't think I deserve this, ah yeah
I don't think I deserve this, ah yeah

Look at me
You swear that we're not half of what we used to be
You're letting all your reasons live inside your head
Yeah, you think it's heavy now
Yeah, my love just weighs you down
Yeah, you're scared that you could drown
No, no

You said, I'm a mess and I've been hurting
I'm asking if it's worth it
Just say you see the purpose, ah yeah
You said, I'm a wreck and I've been nervous
And I've been losing focus
Said you could be my person, ah yeah

You say colors run, but I don't see it
And I'm apologizing for no reason
Nothing ever comes out how I mean it
I don't think I deserve this, ah yeah
I don't think I deserve this
I don't think I deserve this, ah yeah
I don't think I deserve this, ah yeah
I don't think I deserve this, ah yeah

I don't think I deserve this, ah yeah
I don't think I deserve this, ah yeah

I'm a mess and I've been hurting
I'm asking if it's worth it
Just say you see the purpose, ah yeah

I'm a wreck and I've been nervous
And I've been losing focus
Said you could be my person, ah yeah
