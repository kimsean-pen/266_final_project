Where's the love that shines?
Every single time I'm near you
Where's the love that's all
All I want is you
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
I need love to be true

Where's the light that shines?
Out among the neon signs
Every single time I see you
You're mine and only mine
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Ooh, Baby
Where's the love that shines?

Each time I fall for you
It hurts me a little bit more
Than I want it to
I don't want it to
Yeah

Where is the love?
Where is the love?
I need love to be true, yeah
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
I'm coming home to you
Stop, go
Stop, go
Stop, go
I don't know
Yeah
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Yeah
