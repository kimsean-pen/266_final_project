WE ARE A BROKEN WRECK
WE'VE BOTH GOT PILES OF REGRETS

There ain't nothin' you can say or prove
I held the rope that let you down
As we crash into the waves and drown
This is impossible
So if there's any doubt
I will throw you a line
Excuses, excuses
Don't ever remind me
How it is and always will be

There ain't nothin' you can say or prove
That I held the rope that let you down
As we crash into the waves and drown
This is impossible

You've been this way before
Shadows here all know you
I don't know what you've heard
Or what it is inside you
We are all around you
We are all around you
We are all around you

If love comes first
Maybe our lives will dissolve
Young fruit, still not bruised
Hey, maybe, just maybe,
We all made our moves
And mine could've helped you
I could've helped you

WE ARE A BROKEN WRECK
WE'VE BOTH GOT PILES OF REGRETS

WE ARE A BROKEN WRECK
WE'VE BOTH GOT PILES OF REGRETS

There ain't nothing you can say to prove
That I held the rope that let you down
As we crash into the waves and drown
This is impossible!
This is impossible!
