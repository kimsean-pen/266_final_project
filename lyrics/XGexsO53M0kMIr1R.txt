Love is a condition of the head
Wanna push a button and reset
But you're still up in my skirt
I thought if you had a piece of me
I could keep the other 2 or 3
But now that's not how it works

I shouldn't be here right now
But you got me figured out
Pushing my pieces round, I know this game
And I need a miracle
To break from this ritual
Till then I'll be saying the same thing

Take me downtown
Use my body all night
Make me feel like last time
Make it taste like love
Take me downtown
Yours until my heart dies
Give it up one last time
Give it up for love

Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up

Love is a condition of the head
There is no prescription to forget
So you're all over my brain
You're the blue fix that makes me run
I'll do anything to get me some
Stop me before it's too late

I shouldn't be here right now
But you got me figured out
Pushing my pieces round, I know this game
And I need a miracle
To break from this ritual
Till then I'll be saying the same thing

Take me downtown
Use my body all night
Make me feel like last time
Make it taste like love
Take me downtown
Yours until my heart dies
Give it up one last time
Give it up for love

Oh
Give it up
Give it up
