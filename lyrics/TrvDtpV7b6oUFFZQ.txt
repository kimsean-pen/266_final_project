in the morning I miss you
but I won't go back
step off this train this one way track

you're caught in the distance
but I don't know why?
when you justified your exit signs

it don't matter
just a memory been and gone
nature carries on
pulling me along

something for the fire
something for the fire
something for the fire
for the fire

something for the fire
something for the fire
something for the fire
for the fire

in a month of Sundays
I could take you back
you're in my rear view fading black

don't know my destination
but I'm on my way
too long to get here
from today

it don't matter
just a memory been and gone
nature carries on
pulling me along

something for the fire
something for the fire
something for the fire
for the fire

something for the fire
something for the fire
something for the fire
for the fire

and our love is burning in the flames never to return
as the embers start to lose their glow turn to ash and go
turn to ash and go

something for the fire
something for the fire
something for the fire
for the fire

something for the fire
something for the fire
something for the fire
for the fire

something for the fire
something for the fire
something for the fire
for the fire

something for the fire
something for the fire
something for the fire
for the fire

in the morning I miss you but I won't go back
step off this train
this one way track
