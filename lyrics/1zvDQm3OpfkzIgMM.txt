Queen Jane lay in labour
Full nine days or more
Till her women so tired
They could no longer bare
They could no longer bare

Good women, good women
Good women that ye my be
Will you open my right side
And find my baby
And find my baby

Oh no cried the women
That's a thing that never can be
We will send for King Henry
And hear what he might say
And hear what he might say

King Henry was sent for
King Henry he did come
Saying, "What ails thee my lady?
Your eyes they look so dim
Your eyes they look so dim"

King Henry, King Henry
Will you do one thing for me?
That's to open my right side
And find my baby
And find my baby

"Oh no," cried King Henry
"That's a thing that I'll never do
If I lose the flower of England
I shall lose the branch too
I shall lose the branch too"

There was fiddling and dancing
On the day the babe was born
But poor Queen Jane of England
Lay cold as the stone
Lay cold as the stone
