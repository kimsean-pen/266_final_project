No more
It's done
Crawl home
Get gone

Your love
Is evil
Lonesome
My bones

Took me such a long time to figure it out
Now is it too late, I can't do it alone
Took me such a long time to figure it out
Don't take it away, away, oh

Snowstorm
In my heart
Crawl home
Your love
Is evil
I'm lonesome
Just get more and more
Where you've dared

Took me such a long time to figure it out
Now is it too late, I can't do it alone
Took me such a long time to figure it out
Don't take it away, away, oh

Took me such a long time to figure it out
Now is it too late, I can't do it alone
Took me such a long time to figure it out
Don't take it away, away, oh
