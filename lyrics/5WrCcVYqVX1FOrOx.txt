When was the last time you talked to me?
Seriously
I feel like I don't even know you
And I would rather me leave
Than stay and watch you make a fool of me

You might as well leave
You might as well let me know now
You might as well go, go, go
I never wanna see your face 'round here anymore
'Cause it's a breakdown, a breakdown
Where do we go from here?
It's a breakdown, a breakdown

Looking at me lying
If I said I wasn't getting quite bored of you yet
And your consistent nagging
And your constant state of panic
Is unnecessary stress for me

You're the tip, tip, tip-top of the charts
You're the best thing I've ever done
And the reality is that I wrote this song for you

You might as well leave
You might as well let me know now
You might as well go, go, go
I never wanna see your face 'round here anymore
'Cause it's a breakdown, a breakdown
Where do we go from here?
It's a breakdown, a breakdown

When wood floors meet high heels
And shadows form from chandeliers
When wood floors meet high heels
And shadows form from chandeliers

You might as well leave
You might as well let me know now
You might as well go, go, go
I never wanna see your face 'round here anymore
'Cause it's a breakdown, a breakdown
Where do we go from here?
It's a breakdown, a breakdown
