I never meant to be this way,
never thought that I could change,
until you woke me with your touch...

And now they see it in my eyes,
you're the craving of my life;
I want you more than words could say...

You're in my head...
You're in my head...

You touch my skin, you keep me warm,
bring me closer to the sun...
you're the reason, my desire...

I feel serenity in all,
heavy waves of gentle love,
soothing whispers from the stars...

Oh, in my dreams...
... in my dreams...

Such a singleminded lust,
to be there once is not enough;
you change your point of view once stung...

And this is where I want to be;
no anxiety or fear,
a quiet moment in your arms...

If you could see just what I've seen...
If you could see just what I've seen...
If you could see just what I've seen...
If you could see what I have seen,
would you believe?
