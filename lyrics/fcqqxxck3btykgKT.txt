It is a fair and noble arrangement
This business of life and existence
Where everything we take from the earth
Will be taken back and returned

The face of god has always been disguised
As the mother
giver and lover of all life
But the keeper of the ledger for the cult of nature
Only concerns that your body returns on time

Return to the earth, pay the price for your existence
Into the hand of earth's domain
For there is balance to be maintained

The count is cold and calculated, the precision is exact
No one is exempt or unaccounted for,
All that was taken will be taken back

The gods have always been believed to love,
And care for the quality of our lives
But the keeper of the ledger for the cult of nature,
Only concerns with quantity of your time

Return to the earth, pay the price for your existence
Into the hand of earth's domain
For there is balance to be maintained

Return to the earth, pay the price for your existence
Into the hand of earth's domain
For there is balance to be maintained

We create our myths of purpose,
To fill our lives with hope and wonder
But to the keeper of the ledger for the cult of nature
Your body is just... another number

Return to the earth, pay the price for your existence
Into the hand of earth's domain
For there is balance to be maintained

Return to the earth, pay the price for your existence
Into the hand of earth's domain
For there is balance to be maintained

It is a fair assumption, of our human nature to assume...
That the business of nature... is inherently good

(When) nature comes collecting, it doesn't care at all about you
Nature comes collecting, it doesn't care at all to know you
(When) nature comes collecting, it doesn't care to hear your story
Nature comes collecting, and only wants you for your body

Nature is the man (after all), nature is the mob (after all)
Nature is the business (after all), nature is the cult
