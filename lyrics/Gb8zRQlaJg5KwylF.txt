I'd really like you to know
I made it all the way to your show
To watch you play then bail home
Couldn't stay for cones 'cause I drove
It really sucks being on P plates
'Cause you never get to stay up late
If there's something on really far away
Easy, you can just come back to my place

I've been watching you for a while
And I'm really digging your new hairstyle
Would you maybe wanna catch up for a coupla' beers?
'Cause I've been waiting for a night like this

Yeah, let's catch up for a coupla' coupla's
We can get pissed and get to know each other
'Cause you know that I'm just a bird with picky taste
Who has taken a liking to your face
And if it don't work out then we can still be best mates

I'm a greater casual fling
I like to sleep in all morning
We can go for a swim
But, honey, let's not make it boring
Just thought I should let you know that
'Cause the looks you're giving
Are a little telling
You're the only bloke I'm into here

And we're actually getting on really well
Blushing when you're laughing at the jokes I tell
Feeling your arm slide around my waist
I'm backing what's happening, fucking hell

Yeah, let's catch up for a coupla' coupla's
We can get pissed and get to know each other
'Cause you know that I'm just a bird with picky taste
Who has taken a liking to your face
And if it don't work out then we can still be best mates

Oh yeah, like that, darlin'
Oh yeah, like that, darlin'
Oh yeah, like that, darlin'
Oh yeah, like that, darlin'

Laters for now, call me when you're feeling it
I gotta bounce, but I was really into it
Forgot to say that I was going on tour
Baby, maybe one day I'll be yours
