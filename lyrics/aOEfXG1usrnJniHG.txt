It's so like me to write stories of you
I can unmake you, I'll break you in two
Oh my God, what am I going to do
It's such a shame... we are the same
Who could I possibly think that I am?
And should I hurt you? I certainly can
And even if you don't really exist
You are the only one I truly... miss

Who could you possibly think that you are
I gave you a feeling you took it too far
Honestly I really want to know why
I gave you my armor, you left me to die

You probably think that this song's about you
That's just your narcissistic point of view
I made up a story that you were my friend
And when I got older I thought this would end

It's so like me to write stories of you
I can unmake you, I'll break you in two
Oh my God, what am I going to do
