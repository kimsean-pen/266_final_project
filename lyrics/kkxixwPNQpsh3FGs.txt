I can feel your heartbeat, baby
It's something I cannot see, it's crazy
I can feel like I know
How you feel all alone

We dance beneath the sycamore
I'm calling out your love to fall
You know it's hard to find
Golden windows in the sun

I can feel your heartbeat
I can feel your heartbeat
I can feel your heartbeat
