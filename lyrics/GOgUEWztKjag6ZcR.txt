We're so alike, yet different
At a loss for words, stuttering
It don't make sense, what's happening?
I just don't understand

What's this fight all for?
What's the cost of life in this world?
Almost impossible
Is to let the love unite us all

Does anybody care, I'm weak and I'm afraid
Wondering if I will make it through this day
For the life of me I refuse to be anything but free
But I'm tired of all the battling, oh...

What's this fight all for?
What's the cost of life in this world?
Almost impossible
Is to let the love unite us all

(Let the love unite us all) Oh...
(Let the love unite us all) Oh...
Oh... oh... oh...

Oh... (What's this fight all for?)
(What's the cost of life in this world?)
(Almost impossible) Oh...
(Is to let the love unite us all) Oh...

What's this fight all for?
What's the cost of life in this world?
All I ever really want
Is to let the love unite us all
