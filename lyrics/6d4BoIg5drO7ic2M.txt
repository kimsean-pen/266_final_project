After all isn't it
The time that we make
And all the innocence
We give and we take
I've tried so hard
To be there for you
It seems it may mean
Disappearing for you

I don't want to run
I don't want to try to fight it
Every time I try
I find new ways to deny it
I will try my best to
Keep my head nice and quiet
For you
I don't want to hide
I don't want to make it right
Anything you're losing
should you really try to find it?
When I'm on my way
I'll keep my feet nice and quiet
For you

After all isn't it
The fear that we face
And all the bitterness
We try and erase
All of the reasons
To keep me at bay
Are the same reasons
That I should stay

I don't want to run
I don't want to try to fight it
Every time I try
I find new ways to deny it
I will try my best to
Keep my head nice and quiet
For you

I don't want to hide
I don't want to make it right
Anything you're losing
should you really try to find it?
When I'm on my way
I'll keep my feet nice and quiet
For you

I don't want to run
I don't want to try to fight it
Every time I try
I find new ways to deny it
I will try my best to
Keep my head nice and quiet
For you

I don't want to hide
I don't want to make it right
Anything you're losing
Should you really try to find it?
When I'm on my way
I'll keep my feet nice and quiet
For you
