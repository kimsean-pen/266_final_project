Say no more, I'm out the door, the day is gone
Lick my wounds and face the tunes to the call
Five days done, the mood is swung, I'm moving on
I puff my chest, come up for air and take a breath

It's what you want (it's)
It's what you need
It's what you want (it's)
It's what you need

We are night people roaming the streets
Night people, we get what we need

It's been a hell of a week
I couldn't bring myself to sleep
On the move, move with you
Raise a glass to tomorrow's blues
Have a word with my nerve
Talk it off the ledge
I'm in control, invincible
Keep my world 'til the end

It's what you want (it's)
It's what you need
It's what you want (it's)
It's what you need

We are night people roaming the streets
Night people, we get what we need

It's what you want (it's)
It's what you need
It's what you want (it's)
It's what you need

It's what you want (it's)
It's what you need
It's what you want (it's)
It's what you need

It's what you want (it's)
It's what you need
It's what you want (it's)

We are night people roaming the streets
Night people, we get what we need

It's what you want (it's)
It's what you need
It's what you want (it's)
It's what you need
