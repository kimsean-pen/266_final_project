I've been living below the standard
With a hunger that feeds the fire
Off an island you prayed of diamonds
With an envy that kills the pride
See the solstice the gift before you
Wasn't easy to let die

Tell me what you see
Tell me what you see, you
Tell me what you see
Tell me what you see in the mirror
When you're feeling forceless?
Do you see a man who isn't there?
Living for the sake of living
I can promise that no one cares

I've been living below the standard
While you struggle being holding on
Am I an addict doing my young features
You always keep me coming back for more
See the distance becomes between us
Isn't measured by the weight of gold

Tell me what you see
Tell me what you see, you
Tell me what you see
Tell me what you see in the mirror
When you're feeling forceless?
Do you see a man who isn't there?
Living for the sake of living
I can promise that no one cares
What do you see in the mirror
When you're feeling forceless?
Do you see a man who isn't there?
Living for the sake of living
I can promise that no one cares
