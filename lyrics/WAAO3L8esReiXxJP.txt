I'm sorry to start
But I really wanted something
And you play the part
But my life ain't seen no change

I threw down my heart
Maybe now I'll raise the question
Will you be there
'til the end?

Your body is nothing
Without mine
And nobody could compare

I carry the weight
of the world upon my shoulders
If this is fate
Tell me, where did I go wrong?

I breathe in the sound
Of your light as it's reflecting
So when you're alone
Let me know

Your body is nothing
Without mine
And nobody could compare

Your body is nothing
Without mine
And nobody could compare

I'm sorry to start
But I really wanted something
Will you be there
'til the end?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Your body is nothing
Without mine
And nobody could compare

Your body is nothing
Without mine
And nobody could compare

I'm sorry to start
But I really wanted something.
