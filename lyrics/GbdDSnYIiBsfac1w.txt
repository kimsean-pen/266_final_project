Well, it was such an awkward night
It was such an awkward night
Well, I felt like a fool, tongue tied and tipsy, too
But you thought I was Mr. Right
What a wonderful, awkward night

You looked me over, I guess you liked what you saw
And you looked cool, drinking beer from a pink straw
I took a breath through the hole in my chest
Where my heart had disappeared
It was love, and it was weird

It was such an awkward night
It was such an awkward night
Well, I felt like a fool, tongue tied and tipsy, too
But you thought I was Mr. Right
What a wonderful, awkward night, hey

The night I met you, what a humble "How do you do?"
Tongued tied and tipsy, too
I won't forget you, and a bashful past just for two
I flipped my lid right over you

'Cause it was such an awkward night
It was such an awkward night
Well, I felt like a fool, tongue tied and tipsy, too
But you thought I was Mr. Right
What a wonderful, awkward
Oh, what an awkward
A wonderful, awkward night
