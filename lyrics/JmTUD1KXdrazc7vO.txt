Abysmal agony
On the brinck of reason and sanity
Staring into the abysmal agony
Of eternal night
Reap the fruit of this sacrificial rite

Sane duality
Perception of lethality
Suicide mortality

The human cancer spreads
While final days darken
The profit of pain
Made by corporate hands
Grim existance, contamination
Skin decomposing by nuclear rain

Abysmal agony
On the brinck of reason and sanity
Staring into the abysmal agony
Of eternal night
Reap the fruit of this sacrificial rite

At the bottom crows pecking
Eyes of the suicides
Brains smashed into pieces
Consumed by the earth
