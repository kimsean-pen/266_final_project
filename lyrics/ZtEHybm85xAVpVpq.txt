We in a dodging to a feeling I don't wanna know
Yeah I been running but it caught me somehow
The room was never falling off I did it anyway
You made my heart beat and pumping
Why it ain't turn it up so loud

Cause if I don't feel the water
And the night don't feel the thief
It's just you and me together
Here we are, we are, we are, we are

Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!

Here we are, we are, we are, we are
And you're going from inside
Like the dot is in a write
I'm just here for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!

I already know the way and thought I could get in and out
She say relax, you gon be here for a while
But I took caution to the way and did it anyway
And the truth is i'm learning to loving
And I ain't gonna turn it down

Cause if I don't feel the water
And the night don't feel the thief
Once the music sets you over
Here we are, we are, we are, we are

Here we are, we are, we are
And you're going from inside
Like the dot is in a write
I'm just here for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!
Here we are, we are, we are
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!
And you're going from inside
Like the dot is in a write
I'm just here for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria!
