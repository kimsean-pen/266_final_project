I have some serets of my own.
I wonder if you do
Dont keep
Them to your self
Your secrets truble you

Dont keep it all to yourself
Let me shate it too
Thay all truble you
Secreta truble
You
Oh so why not tell me know.
Id like to really know
I know you have one to tell
So tell me it, tell me

Dont keep it to your self
Like a rainbow I have flown into
My dreams have come in colour
When I'm with you
And you have seen my secrets
You have seen my secrets and my life
But I can feel no shame now
With you inside

Dont keep it to your self
Let me share it, to
Thay all trublethay all
Truble you
Secrets truble

Secrets truble

Secreta truble
You

Secrets truble
You secreys truble
You secrets truble you
