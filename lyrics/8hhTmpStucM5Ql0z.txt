I never thought that I could be so bold
To even say these thoughts aloud
I see you with your man, your eyes just shine
While he stands tall and walking proud

That look you give that guy
I wanna see
Looking right at me
If I could be that guy instead of me
I'd never let you down

It always seems like you're going somewhere
Better than you've been before
Well, I go to sleep, and I dream all night
Of you knocking on my door

That look you give that guy,
I wanna see
Looking right at me
If I could be that guy instead of me
I'd be all I can be,
I'd be all I can be

I'm nothing like, what I'd like to be
I'm nothing much, I know it's true
I lack the style and the pedigree
And my chances are so few

That look you give that guy, I wanna see
Looking right at me
If I could be that guy instead of me
I'd give you all I got

I never thought that I could be so bold
To even say these thoughts aloud
But if, let's say, it won't work out
You know where I can be found

That look you give that guy,
I wanna see
Looking right at me
If I could be that guy, instead of me
I'd never let you down
I'd never let you down
