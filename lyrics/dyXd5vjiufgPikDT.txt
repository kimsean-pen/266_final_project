Get kicked out for coming home at dawn
Mom and dad cursed the day you were born
Throw your clothes into a duffel bag
Shoutin' as you slam the door, the home, it's a drag

Who can I turn to and where can I stay?
I heard a place is open all night and all day
There's a place you can go where the cops don't know
You can act real wild, they don't treat you like a child

Runaway boys

Your hair is all greasy and you feel like a slob
You're only fifteen and you can't get a job
Run into the luncheonette and shoot a few games
Losing all your quarters, man it's always the same

Steal a couple of bucks to buy a new toy
Slip into the alley with the runaway boys

Runaway boys

Runnin' faster, faster all the time
You're under age and God knows that's a crime

Get kicked out for coming home at dawn
Mom and dad cursed the day you were born
Throw your clothes into a duffel bag
Shoutin' as you slam the door, the home, it's a drag

Who can I turn to and where can I stay?
I heard a place is open all night and all day
There's a place you can go where the cops don't know
You can act real wild, they don't treat you like a child

Runaway boys

Runnin' faster, faster all the time
You're under age and God knows that's a crime

Runaway boys, runaway boys
Runaway boys, runaway boys
Runaway boys
