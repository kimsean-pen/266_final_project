Take these eyes
Take me on
Here's to???
Puts me off

You're an act
You're a card
Recognize
Tamed and torn

Neon love, without a doubt
Please feel free to wipe them out
Around around, my purpose plan?
I hope you know my gradient

While I figure it out

Piercing them
Guard the ache
Recognized
Million made
That's your call
That's your goal
That's your chance
Now you'll know

Neon love, without a doubt
Please feel free to wipe them out
Around around, my purpose plan
I hope you know my gradient

While I figure it out
While I figure it out
