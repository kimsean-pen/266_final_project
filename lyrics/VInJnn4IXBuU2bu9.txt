Please tell me what went wrong
Wasn't I there for you?
Shedding my tears for you
I never trusted you
You stuck your knife in me
You tried to make me bleed
You're not sorry
Still not sorry

You are my disease
You keep on killing me
I never shouda let you in my heart
I'm trying to believe
You're not the end of me
I'm better off without you

Don't think you're coming back
I put my faith in you
Wasted my time on you
Twisted words, crooked lies
Everything that you did
Led me straight to my grave

You are my disease
You keep on killing me
I never shouda let you in my heart
I'm trying to believe
You're not the end of me
I'm better off without you

You are my disease
You keep on killing me
I never shouda let you in my heart
I'm trying to believe
You're not the end of me
I'm better off without you
Oh, I'm better without you
