Lord, I question whether I've had my fill
Lord, I question whether I can take much more
You may laugh as I lay here bleeding, baby, yeah
No more afters or befores

Some day you'll know just how I feel
You left me there twice before
Some day you'll know just how it feels
Shattered, cast aside, stripped of your pride
Like you were never nothing special
Made you feel like another spoke in the wheel

So you say I'm just another dollar, baby
So you say I'm just another day, yeah
Once my blood was strong but now it's jaded and it's thin
Unlike you I can still tell right from wrong

Some day you'll know just how it feels
While you left me there twice before
Some day you'll know just how it feels
Shattered, cast aside, stripped of your pride
Like you were never nothing special
Made you feel like another spoke in the wheel

Some day you'll know just how it feels
While you left me there twice before
Some day you'll know just how it feels
Shattered, cast aside, stripped of your pride
Like you were never nothing special
Made you feel like another spoke in the wheel
