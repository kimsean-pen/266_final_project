(What dreams)
Splendidly weaved from an atom bomb,
Retrieved from a teleprompt,
Practical, you are not.
(What dreams)
Break the ice with a cotton swab.
A fever that cools us off, handshake's a contact sport.

No one was waiting to throw out the pilot,
We float on the back of the winds that you send us.

Another tomorrow, shedding the shade we made yesterday.
Disguised as the lightning, dissolving all of the thunder, then-
Appeasing our monsters under the acrylic skies.
Another tomorrow,
Another tomorrow.

(So fly)
Grab my hand, here comes the crash.
I live for the strong impact,
That renders both our airbags.
(Seven fold)
Takes every letter you send, don't fold if you're made to bend,
Rekindle the feud again.

No one was waiting to throw out the pilot,
We float on the back of the winds that you send us.

Another tomorrow, shedding the shade we made yesterday.
Disguised as the lightning, dissolving all of the thunder, then-
Appeasing our monsters under the acrylic skies.
Another tomorrow.

(Did you recognize your next door neighbors today?)
(Pure)

String up your harp,
Play like today will last five minutes.
This won't take long,
Sing us a song that stops the silence.
String up your harp,
Play like today will last five minutes.
This won't take long,
Sing us a song that stops the silence.

Another tomorrow, shedding the shade we made yesterday.
Disguised as the lightning, dissolving all of the thunder, then-
Appeasing our monsters under the acrylic skies.
Another tomorrow.
