I'm born by time and race
I long to find a face
In love I am alive

These fears I cannot hide

I live a life of lies
I love the truth you hide
Can we accept the weight?
Our love is born through hate

Feeling the way you breath down my side
I'll never escape you, I can never try
Seeing the way you look in my eyes
I'm lost in illusion, my world set aside

Are all my senses real?
For all I am and feel?
In you I see perfection in all I am and feel

Feeling the way you breath down my side
I'll never escape you, I can never try
Seeing the way you look in my eyes
I'm lost in illusion, my world set aside
