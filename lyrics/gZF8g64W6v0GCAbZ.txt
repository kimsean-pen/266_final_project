You've been knocked out, come around
Shot down, shattered on the stoney ground
You'll take it from me
It's how it'll be
Your dreams will come true, fall through
Screw you badly, you to black and blue
You'll take it from me
It's how it'll be

Love's gonna leave you broken
Time's gonna work you over
You get up, you get up
You keep rolling on
Life's gonna bring you glory
But there's another side to the story
You get up and suck it up
You keep rolling on

But if you crash right in the quicksand
I will pick you up, I'll pull you out
And if the world change
Your brittle through heartbreaks
We will patch it up, we'll work it out
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
We will patch it up, we'll work it out

You'll be on track, on the rack
Bounce back, wheeling down a bumpy road
You'll take it from me
It's how it'll be
Through the good times, the sad times
Oh, off you go
But take it from me
Whatever you need

Love's gonna leave you broken
Time's gonna work you older
You get up, you get up
You keep rolling on
Life's gonna bring you glory
But there's another side to the story
You get up and suck it up
You keep rolling on

But if you crash right in the quicksand
I will pick you up, I'll pull you out
And if the world change
Your brittle through heartbreaks
We will patch it up, we'll work it out

When your world cracks open
When your heart is broken
We will patch it up, we'll work it out
We will patch it up, we'll work it out

And if the world change
You've been through heartbreaks
We will patch it up, we'll work it out
I will patch you up, we'll work it out
