Tell me what happened this time
Made you come back again
I find out only see you when luck deserts you
If this is your idea of happiness
Then let's be clear
Those words of yours ain't working anymore

'Cause I'm always giving
Here waiting while you're living
I need a new beginning
Oh, I'm not the girl I used to be with you

You think maybe that I'm just so easy
You can come in and out my life like you please
But baby no (uh-oh)
Don't you know it takes more
To keep a girl like me
No more waiting for you to change
Don't you know that you bringing flowers
Won't stop the rain baby no, no (uh-oh)
Don't you know it takes more
You're the only one not worth waiting for

I know you're busy so if you gotta go
Then go but don't forget to leave my heart
I stayed around for you but
You're no where to be found now
Once again here you are

'Cause I'm always giving
Here waiting while you're living
I need a new beginning
Oh, I'm not the girl I used to be with you

You think maybe that I'm just so easy
You can come in and out my life like you please
But baby no (uh-oh)
Don't you know it takes more
To keep a girl like me
No more waiting for you to change
Don't you know that you bringing flowers
Won't stop the rain baby no-no (uh-oh)
Don't you know it takes more
You're the only one not worth waiting for

I've settled for less
When I stayed with you but no more
'Cause you ain't worth waiting for, ooh, uuuuh

You think maybe that I'm just so easy
You can come in and out my life like you please
But baby no (uh-oh)
Don't you know it takes more
(Don't you know it takes much more)
To keep a girl like me
No more waiting for you to change
(Waiting for you, no, no, no, no)
Don't you know that you bringing flowers
Won't stop the rain baby no-no (uh-oh)
Don't you know it takes more
You're the only one not worth waiting for

(Uh-oh) Don't you know it takes more
(Uh-oh) Don't you know it takes much more
(Uh-oh) Don't you know it takes much more
You're the only one not worth waiting for
You think maybe that I'm just so easy
You can come in and out my life like you please
But baby no
Don't you know it takes much more
No-no, no more waiting for you to change
Don't you know that you bringing flowers
Won't stop the rain, no, oh
Don't you know it takes much more, oh
