I wanna love you baby
Say that you'll be with me
Long it may be, oh yeah, babe
Cause I've been lost for too long
Don't you go, don't you leave me
'Cause I've been lost for so long
So long, so long

When I see you from a distance
When I see how you ignore me with persistence
And I know you're happy
And you're children are grown-up
And your husband is loving ya
I don't know if I can go on because I've been so, so lost
I've been so, so lost
So long, so long, so long, so lost

And I'm waking up in the middle of the night, When the moon is not just born,
I see you with my eyes I see you and it haunt me yeah
And you tant me and you haunt me
'Cause I've been so, so lost, so lost
