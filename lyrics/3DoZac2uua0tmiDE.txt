When we met
The sparkle in your eyes
Showed me
We were meant to be
In love
Sharing our fantasies

You touched me
Then we kissed
I could not believe
That love was so strong
It didn't take too long
To learn

Love will go on and on
Love's an everlasting bond

When I'm next to you
Our love flows through
I can't explain
What you do?
When I'm next to you
I feel brand new
I love you for
All the things you do

Can't deny
The feelings deep inside
Our hearts and minds
Love is alive
It's true

I'm so into you
I love you

When I'm next to you
Our love flows through
I can't explain
What you do?
When I'm next to you
I feel brand new
I love you for
All the things you do

You know when I'm all alone
You're so far away
I wish that you were here
Holding me
And I find myself thinkin'
Of how it would be
Knowin' you're with me

I love the way I feeling
When I'm looking to your eyes
I love you baby
I love the way I feeling
When I'm still by your side
And I want you baby
I need you

When I'm next to you
Our love flows through
I can't explain
What you do?
When I'm next to you
I feel brand new
I love you for
All the things you do
When I'm next to you
Our love flows through
I can't explain
What you do?
When I'm next to you
I feel brand new
