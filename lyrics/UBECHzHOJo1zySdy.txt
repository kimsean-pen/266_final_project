all the tables nice and clean
evelyn's asleep
on the grave yard shift again
selling gasoline

and theres kids smoking on south first
see high-school was just a blur, to her
and everything just found their place it seemed

theres an old folk song on the radio
sounding thin and dark and haunted
theres a bag of weed in the back beneath the books

and she can't stand the sight of this coldasac
like an old crow, king of the lamp-post
and this window hasn't been this clean since it last rained

well she pictures up a different day
driving west to east L.A
and there aint no sign of a dime, but hey
anyone can dream... anyone can dream

and all the college girls come in when the bars let out and they're hungry
making such a mess, evelyn just talks trash, as she's sweeping up

theres a thin dark cloud in the evening air
after every sunny day
there's a bum who lives in the parking lot
wash the windows just to say hey.

all the tables nice and clean
evelyn's asleep
on the grave yard shift again
selling gasoline
