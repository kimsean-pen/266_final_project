White smoke billows
From the Sistine
77 votes to the city
And the world

The great unwashed
The ones no one see
Slipping through the cracks
The keys of the kingdom

The suffering church
The art of war
Industrial society
And its future

Mirror mirror on the wall
Who is there
In the room of tears?

Year 1666
St. Paul's Cathedral burns
In the Great Fire of London

7th of July 2005
A series of bomb attacks
From King's Cross
To Russell Square

A passenger flight
Disappears in the night
And I will never forget
Our 77 young

Soft targets moving
Through endless summer
Across the land
And the water

Mirror mirror on the wall
Who is there
In the room of tears?
