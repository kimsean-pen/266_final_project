Oh, I could be a hero
I could be a lover of a thousand movie queens
I could be a hero
I could be anything
Caught in the sunrise
And I'm blinded by the light
Caught in the moonrise
And I'm blinded by the night

Chorus:
Fall asleep in the afternoon
How do you know?
Fall asleep in the May of June
How do you, how do you, how do you, how do you know?
How do you know?

Bored in the city
And I'm trampled by the street.
Bored in the country
And I'm trampled by the heat.

Repeat chorus

Bad dreams never stay too long,
They always go away by the break of day.
So, just sleep when things go wrong,
They go away, leave with the day.

Repeat chorus

Sleep is night begins my day
Dreams are real and near is away
I close my mind off from the light
My day is sleep begins by night

All those stories in my head
Come to life atop by bed
I doze my mind off from the light
My day is sleep begins by night

Oh, I could be a hero
I could be a lover of a thousand movie queens
I could be a hero
I could be anything, anything in my dreams.
