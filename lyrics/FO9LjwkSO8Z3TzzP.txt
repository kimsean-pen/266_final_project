You are the one think that one thing that count on
You were my everything
And then i found out that we mean nothing from someone on the street
And i never saw it comming never saw it comming
No i never saw it comming never saw something
I believe all the things you said i believe you

If you where me would you push you
Would you turn the other cheek if i give you
Would you cry out would u break down
Would u wait for comment to come around
Would u give up
Would it be enough
To make you never ever wanna be in love
What would you do what would u do if you were me
Would it be through

I dont know whats left to talk about but i found it hard to leave
With us so closure how could want her
When you were still with me

And i never saw it comming never saw it comming
No i never saw it comming never saw something

If you where me would you push you
Would you turn the other cheek if i give you
Would you cry out would u break down
Would u wait for comment to come around
Would u give up
Would it be enough
To make you never ever wanna be in love
What would you do what would u do if you were me
Would it be through

You turned something so good so bad
Threw out all the things we had
Put yourself in my shoes its so sad
I believed all the things you said i believed in you

If you where me would you push you
Would you turn the other cheek if i give you
Would you cry out would u break down
Would u wait for comment to come around
Would u give up
Would it be enough
To make you never ever wanna be in love
What would you do what would u do if you were me
Would it be through

Would it be through

What would u do if you where me

What would u
