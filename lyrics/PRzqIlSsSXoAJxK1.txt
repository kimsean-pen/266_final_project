I stand as I cry
Mourning in the silent rain
Death will light my burden
Endless is my sorrow
Gateways so dark
All these years of dying
Gone are dreams of velvet voices
I am you, we were one
Vast are fields I walk
Where sorrow never dies
The sky unites with the blackened rain
Summon with my tears
Now descend on winterwings
My withering soul.
Let me die,
Gateways of Bereavement
A temple of guilt
Falling deep
Embraced in grief
My withering soul
Let me die
Farewell life and all I died for
Now my time is over on Earth
Another journey ha begun
Alone I died, not praying for mercy
Nor praying for salvation
A lonely journey in a darkened dream
Time has come to spread my wings
Slow...
descending from the silent sky
Death comes to take me away
And from the gateways you hear my cry...
I love you ...
