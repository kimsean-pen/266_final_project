We were hungry and asleep
Drowning like a sinking ship
You and me again this time boy
You and me again this time boy

Follow under all the line
Don't know we're from right or wrong
Letting you inside my mind boy
Letting you inside my mind boy

'Cause you are my answer and I am your field
We're growing together throwing the seeds
Though we're lost and tired
Still I feel inspired
By your life, by your name, by your soul
By your life, by your name, by your soul

Morning bells are in my head
And I remember why you've said
You and me again this time boy
You and me again this time boy

'Cause you are my answer and I am your field
We're growing together throwing the seeds
Though we're lost and tired
Still I feel inspired
By your life, by your name

'Cause you are my answer

By your life, by your name

'Cause you are my answer and I am your field
We're growing together throwing the seeds
Though we're lost and tired
Still I feel inspired
By your life, by your name, by your soul
By your life, by your name, by your soul

Mmmmm

By your life, by your name, by your soul
