I used to think that label were just symbol of pride
but over time i've seen they only serve to divide
it's so easy to judge people by the way they seem to be
we must overcome this problem to live life peacfully
break down the walls!
yes, we'll break down the walls!
look beyond the fashion or the crowd that they are in
look beyond their riches or the color of their skin
look beyond appearance and the truth you will find
look for what's inside before you make up your mind
break down the walls!
we'll break down the walls!
