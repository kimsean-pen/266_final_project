I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place that we just met
She's just a girl for me
And I want all the world to see that we've met

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight

Falling, yes I'm falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

I have never known the like of this
I've been alone and I have
Missed things and kept out of sight
For other girls were never quite like this

Falling, yes I'm falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Falling, yes I'm falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place that we just met
She's just a girl for me
And I want all the world to see that we've met

Falling, yes I'm falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Falling, yes I'm falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
