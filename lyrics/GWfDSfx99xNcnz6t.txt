Fell in love with a boy,
I fell in love once and almost completely
He's in love with the world
But sometimes these feelings can be so misleading,
He turns and says are you alright
Oh I must be fine cause my hearts still beating
Come and kiss me by the riverside
Sarah says it's cool she don't consider it cheating

Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh Red hair with a curl
Mellow roll for the flavor and the eyes were peeping
Can't keep away from the boy
The two sides of my brain need to have a meeting
Can't think of any thing to do
My left-brain knows all our love is fleeting
He's just looking for something new
And I said it once before but it bears repeating

Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh Can't think of anything to do
My left-brain knows all our love is fleeting
He's just looking for something new
I said it once before but it bears repeating

Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh Fell in love with a boy
I fell in love once and almost completely
He's in love with the world
But sometimes these feelings can be so misleading
He turns and says are you alright
Oh must be fine cause my hearts still beating
Come and kiss me by the riverside
Sarah says it's cool she don't consider it cheating

Don't go telling no more, don't go telling no more, don't go telling no more lies on Sarah
Don't go telling no more, don't go telling no more, don't go telling no more lies on Sarah

Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh Can't think of anything to do
My left-brain knows all our love is fleeting
He's just looking for something new
I said it once before but it bears repeating

Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh I'm gonna tell you what's on my mind
I'm gonna tell you what's on my mind

Ooh ooh oooh oh oh oh ooh

but it bears repeating
