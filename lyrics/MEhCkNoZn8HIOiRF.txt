Am feeling high
Champagne fly
Work hard everyday till wi reach to the goal
This a fi the people them weh work hard
All who gone to the morgue
RIP to a love one
Put yo cups them high

Like the feelings right
Going on high grade flight
Tugs a prole up, girls a roll out
Everything is nice yea
Everything is nice

Hennessy pock up, refill yo cup
Music a play till the speaker f**k up
Gyal faint when mi clip mi finger like irrupt
Shi a wine under rum and syrup
Reaching out to all who do 9-5
Weh a put in the work and a fight fi strive
From UWI to U-Tech, ease the exam stress and hold a vibes

Like the feelings right
Going on high grade flight
Tugs a prole up, girls a roll out
Everything is nice yea
Everything is nice

Am feeling high
Champagne fly
Work hard everyday till wi reach to the goal
This a fi the people them weh work hard
All who gone to the morgue
RIP to a love one
Put yo cups them high

Like the feelings right
Going on high grade flight
Tugs a prole up, girls a roll out
Everything is nice yea
Everything is nice

Sometimes mi know seh yo stressed out
Caw the bills them pending
Or yo lost everything weh yo work everyday and invest in
Watch yah now, touch the club find a girl and bubble pon
Find a party fi tek out the trouble on
Pop Skull dedicate this one to every victim and all ex-con

Like the feelings right
Going on high grade flight
Tugs a prole up, girls a roll out
Everything is nice yea
Everything is nice
