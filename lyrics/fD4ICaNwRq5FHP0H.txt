Leeches, you're sucking up the life
Creatures are not afraid to fight
We're not letting you, steal all that molded us
If you only knew, you're only made of dust

We are, not your property
See with our own clarity
Ears closed, eyes open, voice won't be broken
Won't dance within your walls

You'll find us
Running around every town, unchaining all your bounds
That we once used to crown
Throwing your words to the ground
We'll do this, our, our own way
Can't change the storm of a hurricane

Feet dance to our own beat
Won't sing to your melody
We don't care if we're the only
People swimming in the sea
We'll do this, our, our own way
Can't change the storm of a hurricane

Made me, care what you think
Only, made our bodies sink
Continue, playing the game alright
Crumbling with you, is your fake life
Tell me how it's good for us again
Raise your brow, get it out and condescend
This is not working, my lungs are chocking
No longer at your call

You'll find us
Running 'round every town unchaining all your bounds
That we once used to crown
Throwing your words to the ground
We'll do this, our, our own way
Can't change the storm of a hurricane

Feet dance to our own beat
Won't sing to your melody
We don't care if we're the only
People swimming in the sea
We'll do this, our, our own way
Can't change the storm of a hurricane

Don't go changing souls
What happened to being bold
Shaking off what we were told
Not fitting to your mold
We'll do this, our, our own way
Can't change the storm of a hurricane

We are not your property
See with our own clarity
Ears closed, eyes open, voice won't be broken
Won't dance within your walls

You'll find us
Running 'round every town unchaining all your bounds
That we once used to crown
Throwing your words to the ground
We'll do this, our, our own way
Can't change the storm of a hurricane

Feet dance to our own beat
Won't sing to your melody
We don't care if we're the only
People swimming in the sea
We'll do this, our, our own way
Can't change the storm of a hurricane
