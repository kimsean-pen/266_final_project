Through air

Along the path I laid
Saw it race by
Memories in tow
Into the belly of the earth

Light of dawn, all alone
Char-like shadows, slither away – through water
Wounded, burned and without site
Not waiting for another night

Now headed for the wild
Called from afar and within – through soil
Leaving lost wars behind
Wildfires of need, calm waters of the mind – through thought

Battle cries now resounded
On a field at the world's end
A clash of gods and giants
In the centre of the mind

Through emotion
Through reality

Saw a mound
Had to bury
Sung for another me
Had to do (it), so that I could be
One for sight
Two for flesh
Three were the norns
Four corners of the worlds
Five the number of a man
Six one two and three
Seven streams of blood
Eight-legged child of Loke
