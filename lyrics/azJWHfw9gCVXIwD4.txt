I love what I can't see
What's expected of you, what's expected of me?
Now it's quarter to three
Let it all get away
Oh, what the hell can I do?
To fill the pages
Meet the strangers
Kiss the girl
Take it in
Feel the ages

A time or two
But its all so good
To let up

Dead weight, dead weight
Dead weight
Dead weight, dead weight
Dead weight
Dead weight
(I'm falling around and around)
Dead weight
Dead weight
(I'm falling around and around)
Dead weight

Got everything I need
Clothes on my back
The wind on my teeth
What I control is in me
There's more wood to burn

Oh what the hell can I do?
To fill the pages
Meet the strangers
Kiss the girl,
Take it in

Feel the ages
But I fall so good
When I go

Dead weight, dead weight
Dead weight
Dead weight, dead weight
Dead weight
Dead weight
(I'm falling around and around)
Dead weight
Dead weight
(I'm falling around and around)
Dead weight
Dead weight
(I'm falling around and around)
Dead weight
Dead weight
(I'm falling around and around)
Dead weight
