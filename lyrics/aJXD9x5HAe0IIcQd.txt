The day is getting shady
Playing in the isle
There's nothing in this life to do
But stay here for a while

The day is getting shady
Playing in the isle
There's nothing in this life to do
But stay here for a while

And nothing you say and nothing you do
Can stop me from thinking about you
Doesn't matter if it's right
You're just (one of us?)

And nothing you say and nothing you do
Can stop me from thinking about you
Doesn't matter if it's right
You're just (one of us?)

Can't get you out of my head
Even through the miles
I know that it is wrong but you
Just seem to drive me wild

Can't get you out of my head
Even through the miles
I know that it is wrong but you
Just seem to drive me wild

And nothing you say and nothing you do

Doesn't matter if it's right
You're just (one of us?)
