Why dont you go photograph
Everything that ever passed in time
Indigenous traces, tribal chiefs
Vanishing hereditary lines
Poets gone wild on the muse
Prophets all destroying the Tao

When you see that honking antelope
The secret dance of snakes, the tales of it all

Nature based being will survive
Apocalyptic days of now
Poets gone wild on the muse
Prophets all destroying the Tao

When you see that honking antelope
The secret dance of snakes, the tales of it all

Of it all
Run away with me now
Run away with me now
My life

We are the cause of a world thats gone
wrong

Nature will survive us even gods after all
Why dont you go photograph
Everything that ever passed in time
Poets gone wild on the muse

Prophets all destroying the Tao
When you see that honking antelope
The secret dance of snakes, the tales of it all
When you see that honking antelope

The secret dance of snakes, the tales of it all
Of it all
Run away with me now
Run away with me now
My love
We are the cause of a world thats gone
wrong
Nature will survive us even gods after all
We are the cause of a world thats gone
wrong
Wouldnt it be great to heal the world
With only a song
