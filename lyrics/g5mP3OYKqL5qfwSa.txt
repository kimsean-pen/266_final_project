I don't know where,
where to begin,
how should I feel after all that you
You put me in,
kinda funny how I lost this time but when
Just tell me when,
when did all your patience grow so thin
It's sinkin' in,
and I can't say anything so

Don't bother hittin' me with excuses
Don't bother lookin' back at me
I've gone insane by the way that you've always tried to leave
It's all built up inside of me
So I keep my head down and get out of this town

I'm not worried til' the sun comes up
Will you tell me that's over?
Don't tell me that it's over
Why can't it be so simple like it was
So can we do it over why can't we do it over right now?

As soon as you walk out the door,
you come back for more and you've left me no choice
All the things that I heard before,
don't wanna hear no more
And I can't believe it's all I've ever wanted

Don't bother hittin' me with excuses
Don't bother lookin' back at me
I've gone insane by the way that you've always tried to leave
It's all built up inside of me
So I keep my head down and get out of this town

I'm not worried til' the sun comes up
Will you tell me that's over?
Don't tell me that it's over
Why can't it be so simple like it was
So can we do it over why can't we do it over right now?

Don't bother hittin' me with excuses
Don't bother lookin' back at me
I've gone insane by the way that you've always tried to leave
It's all built up inside of me
So I keep my head down and get out of this town

I'm not worried til' the sun comes up
Will you tell me that's over?
Don't tell me that it's over
Why can't it be so simple like it was
So can we do it over why can't we do it over right now?

So tell that's over
So tell that's over

why can't we do it over
why can't we do it over right now?
