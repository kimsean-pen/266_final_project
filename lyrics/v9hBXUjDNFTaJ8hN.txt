Hop up out the bed, all I see is red
You can't ride wit' me, all my friends dead
See my partner chained up so I'm like fuck the feds
I ain't fuck the judge, nigga fuck the judge
Middle finger 12
Dropped up out that college shit so I'm like fuck the bill
Watchu' tellin' me I dont give a fuck unless you pay that time for me
If you was in my shoes you prolly wouldn't have no time for me
Know these niggas see me cause I don't got no time for lames
I just fucked yo' bitch I think she like this kinda fame
Can't be yo' nigga bitch I ain't even got this time for days
These nigga penny pitchin', broke as fuck, no time for games
Lil' bih' roll that gas, lil' hoe tryna get lit
I'm tryna fuck up the check
She's tryna fuck up the dick
What, huh
Hoe gettin' on my nerves
Bitch she out the 'burb
I kick that hoe to the curb

On that same shit
You on lame shit
Bring that pain shit
You gon' fake kick
Walk in wit' the stick
Lookin' like a lick
Make these nigga sick
Know I keep it tuck
Rock it by my gut
Codiene in my gut
Valentino cup
Cobras on my neck
We gon' blow that jit
JP on me too
Watch me Ricky step

Deagle drippin' on me flood the fakes
Walk up in the party gassin' like I brought the tape
Lil' hoe gon' stay wet for me
You can't live this life I live cause this shit meant for me
Got that burner on me hit him with that 3rd degree
If he testin' let him know we got that smoke free
Throwin' smoke wit' me
I stay gang 'ah deep
30 it stay up on me
Up it, it's tucked
Up it, he stuck
Lil' boy better not get bucked
Lil' boy he know what's up
Get bucked wit' a cup, it's us
It's me, I walk in the club 10 deep
Lil' boy wan' test on me
I got that fire on me

On that same shit
You on lame shit
Bring that pain shit
You gon' fake kick
Walk in wit' the stick
Lookin' like a lick
Make these nigga sick
Know I keep it tuck
Rock it by my gut
Codiene in my gut
Valentino cup
Cobras on my neck
We gon' blow that jit
JP on me too
Watch me
