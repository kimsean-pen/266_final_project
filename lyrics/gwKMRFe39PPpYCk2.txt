We fumbled around
Pushing stones through the mesh
We reap 'cause we sow
It's a song to the flesh
I had to dream in monochrome
A lie that they've spun
I think I hear heaven calling me home
We're like poised from the sun

Two lives, later I'll find
But everybody's coming round here
Raise arms, I've got a hand to call mine
I'm still out to find peace in my mind

I'm running on a heartbeat, I can feel it in my blood flow
Eyes up when they call me, 'cause we're fighting in the good war
So set me off with a godspeed, then I slam through the backdoor
You and I are gonna die free, 'cause we're fighting in the good war

We fumble around
Pushing homes from the nest
We're too far to be found ('cause we're fighting in the good war)
I had to speak in the protocol, biting my tongue
Sometimes I hear hell calling me home
Yeah but I know, it's such a lie we've spun

I'm running on a heartbeat, I can feel it in my blood flow
Eyes up when they call me, 'cause we're fighting in the good war
So set me off with a godspeed, then I slam through the backdoor
You and I are gonna die free, 'cause we're fighting in the good war

I'm running on a heartbeat, I can feel it in my blood flow
Eyes up when they call me, 'cause we're fighting in the good war
So set me off with a godspeed, then I slam through the backdoor
You and I are gonna die free, 'cause we're fighting in the good war
