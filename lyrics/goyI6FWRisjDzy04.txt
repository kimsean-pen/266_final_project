I'm working pretty hard to keep it up
I don't know how to start, don't know when to stop

I just found out – hey! I'm a man
I've got feelings and sweaty hands
You can't help what you look like
You can only look like it

When you tell me to hold you, what does it mean?
Is it an invitation to be as I seem?
I couldn't say, I'm feeling nervous
But if you ask then I'm at your service
Just tell me what I'm asking for

I'd like to know you better
But the fears and social pressure that's
Affecting my affections
How can I approach perfection thinking
You are foreign language
You are not real
I know I ought to hide
But I only wanna feel and
I wouldn't want to hurt you now
Even if I had the chance
Because you asked me to this dance
Because you ask me now to dance
In front of all my friends in front of
Everyone I know
I am dancing I am dancing
And I don't want to dance slow I wanna sweat

I want to know what your weaknesses are
Come on and tell me what your weaknesses are

There's something different about you, you're not me
But you remember the things that I say
The same heat that makes you blush
Gives me a blood rush too

What are you doing? People have died
Shame on you for being alive

No, there's no shame in it
Everybody does it
It's not unnatural
It's not illegal
No one can tell you when to shine

I'd like to know you better
But the fears and social pressure that's
Affecting my affections
How can I approach perfection thinking
You are foreign language
You are not real
I know I ought to hide
But I only wanna feel like
I wouldn't want to hurt you now
Even if I had the chance
Because you asked me to this dance
Because you ask me now to dance
In front of all my friends in front of
Everyone I know
I am dancing I am dancing
And I don't want to dance slow I wanna sweat
