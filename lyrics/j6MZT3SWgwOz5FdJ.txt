One with the light shined on them
How quickly the glimma fades
Spread spreading out my stone wings
Why I, I become the storm
The finest marble
Like a raven heading for the sun
Spread spreading out my stone wings
Why I, I become the storm
Forth from the river with the yellow tide
Don't get toothed at the cliffs
I'm sad, sad about somethin
And there's no soul left to grate here
Like overstaying
A welcome that has been denied
Take me to the opium benign
Where the light took time
Ahh steamrollers paved over life
All I can say is what a pim it's been
Will the clouds carry my tears to you
Carry my tears to you
Carry my tears
Will the clouds carry my tears to you
Carry my tears to you
Carry my tears
