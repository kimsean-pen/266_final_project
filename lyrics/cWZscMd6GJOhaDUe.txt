Can you love, can you love
Can you love the version of me
I don't let, I don't let
I don't let anybody else see?
When I choke, when I choke
When I choke, would you try and help me breathe?
Can you love, can you love
Can you love the version of me

That isn't happy all the time?
I get outta my head, get outta my mind
Can't get outta bed sometimes
And when I look at myself as if I might cry
'Cause I got some trauma, some family drama
Just thought I'd warn you

You have a hard time making sense of this
I'm the most lowkey masochist
The wrong place if you're looking for Heaven
So I got one question

Can you love, can you love
Can you love the version of me
I don't let, I don't let
I don't let anybody else see?
When I choke, when I choke
When I choke, would you try and help me breathe?
Can you love, can you love
Can you love the version of me

That's gonna wanna stay the night?
I get outta my head, get outta my mind
Can't be on my own sometimes
I don't even need bait, and I'll probably bite
'Cause I got some trauma, some family drama
Just thought I'd warn you

You have a hard time making sense of this
I'm the most lowkey masochist
The wrong place if you're looking for Heaven
So I got one question

Can you love, can you love
Can you love the version of me
I don't let, I don't let
I don't let anybody else see?
When I choke, when I choke
When I choke, would you try and help me breathe?
Can you love, can you love
Can you love the version of me

(That isn't happy all the time?
That's gonna wanna stay the night?)

Maybe it's just something in my brain (In my brain)
Maybe it's the way I was raised (Oh)
I wouldn't blame you if you tried to walk away
But I want you to stay
Yeah, I want you to stay
I just got one question

Can you love, can you love
Can you love the version of me
I don't let, I don't let
I don't let anybody else see? (I just got one question)
When I choke, when I choke
When I choke, would you try and help me breathe?
Can you love, can you love
Can you love the version of me

Can you love, can you love
Can you love the version of me
I don't let, I don't let
I don't let anybody else see?
