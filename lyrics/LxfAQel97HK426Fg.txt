Listen to the trees outside
Trading information
You know they're just like us

Listen to the train go by
Sparkling on the railroad tracks
Operate for those who need

Hear the rain falling
On the carpet again
Did you speak my name
Or did I dream it up

Crushed by tiny bugs again
Cellphone makes an awful sound
Your heart is the only place
Memory cannot escape

Rewind all the words you said
Take it back to zero
How can you be so sadistic

Memories of touching hands
Children at the theme park of value and time
Nothing remains

Look in the mirror then turn away

I try hard to find myself
Nothing seems to go my way
Though I'm patient and I'll wait
On a journey through the past
Lost in someone else's dream
Cellphone makes an awful sound
Your heart is the only place
Memory cannot escape
Your heart is the only place
Memory cannot escape
