(Mor)ning be(gins in)side the flow(er
An) abundance (of new) life e(mer)ges
Each (hour on) land, in wat(er and) air
Inside (morning) begins
Circles of eggs in mud-mound nests
With gentleness are protected inside
Warm underneath rotting leaf heat
The mystery is all around us continuously
(Smaller lands drifting continuously)
