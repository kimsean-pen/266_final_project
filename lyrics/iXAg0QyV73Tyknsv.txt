Sometimes it leaves me with fear
Never saw the horizon this near
Look to the left then to the right
I tuck you in and kiss you goodnight

See there is something I know
We are not whom we're told
We are more than we'll never know

And we're living at the end of the world
Forget about all that you've heard
Living our dreams on the highway
It's just another day
No matter what they say or you've heard
We're living on top of the world
We're living our dreams on the highway
No matter what they say
It's just another day

I hear your heart beat in the night
You are like an echo of light
But in times when shallow runs deep
Your golden beauty goes cheap
Still there is something I know
Something yet to unfold
And we are more than we'll never know

And we're living at the end of the world
Forget about all that you've heard
Living our dreams on the highway
It's just another day
No matter what they say or you've heard
We've made it to the top of the world
Building up speed on the highway
We've made it to the end
Living at the end of the world

Forget about all that you've heard
No matter what they say or you've heard
We've made it to the top of the world
Building up speed on the highway
We've made it to the end of the world
