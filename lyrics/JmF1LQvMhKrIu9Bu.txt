I bring out the best in you
But you bring out the worst in me
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (for you)
But you don't give me anything

Wish that I was strong enough to weather this storm
My friends are saying they don't recognize me from before
But when I say "I'll leave", you don't believe me anymore

'Cause you know that I'll always be there
Maybe that's why you don't care
So just take it all
And watch how I fall
Always thinking you'll catch me
You are killing me slowly
I keep holding my breath
'Cause I love you to death
I love you to death
I love you to death

You're the reason I still hope
You're the reason I still choke
Used to be in love would take my hurt away
But now you love to watch me break, mmmh

How I'm a suppose to leave if you refuse to let me go
Don't know how I ever let you have so much control
Every time you feelin' high you make me feel so low

'Cause you know that I'll always be there
Maybe that's why you don't care
So just take it all
And watch how I fall
Always thinking you'll catch me
You are killing me slowly
I keep holding my breath
'Cause I love you to death
I love you to death
I love you to death

Every time you come back I believe it
But I know that you don't really mean it
You're so good being bad that I buy it
Every time you come around

You're the reason I still hope
You're the reason I still choke

'Cause you know that I'll always be there
Maybe that's why you don't care
So just take it all
And watch how I fall
Always thinking you'll catch me
You are killing me slowly
I keep holding my breath
'Cause I love you to death
I love you to death
I love you to death
