Yeah like it or not
Like a ball and a chain
All I wanna do is get off
I feel it for a minute babe
hot diggity dog
I love god all the same
But all I wanna do is get off
I feel it I feel it I feel it babe
Baby, come on
If you have a hard time gettin' there
Maybe you're gone
If you find, you find yourself
Against yourself
Yeah maybe I fought
Once thought I was sane
But all I wanna do is get off
And feel it for a minute
Like the real thing baby, I guess
I already forgot
What I thought I would say
But all I wanna do is get off
I feel it I feel it I feel it babe
Baby, come on
If you have a hard time gettin' there
Maybe you're gone
If you find, you find yourself
Against yourself
Hey, come on
If you have a hard time gettin' there
Maybe you're gone
If you find, you find yourself
Against yourself
And like it or not
Like a ball and a chain
All I wanna do is get off
And feel it for a minute like the real thing baby, oh yes
I already forgot
What I thought I would say
But all I wanna do is get off
I feel it I feel it I feel it babe
Baby, come on
If you have a hard time gettin' there
Maybe you're gone
If you find, you find yourself
Against yourself
