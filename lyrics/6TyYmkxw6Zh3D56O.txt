Some expression in your eyes
Overtook me by surprise

Where was I
How was I to know?
How we can drive to a movie show
When the music is here in my car?
There's a band playing on the radio
With a rhythm of rhyming guitars

They're playing
Oh yeah
On the radio.

And so it came to be our song

And so on through all summer long

Day and night drifting on into love.
Driving you home from a movie show
So in tune to the sounds in my car.
There's a band playing on the radio

It's some time since we said goodbye
And now we lead our seperate lives.
But where am I
Where can I go?
Driving alone to a movie show
So I turn to the sounds in my car.
There's a band playing on the radio
And it's drowing the sound of my tears.
They're playing
Oh yeah
On the radio.
