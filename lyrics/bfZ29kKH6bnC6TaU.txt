You wanna walk into the room like that other girl does
The one that's always making everybody fall in love
You see, girl you're a lot like me

She rearranges all the light in the room
So you're always in the shadows
Well that's what it feels like to you
Baby, i've been there too

And i know how much it can sometimes hurt
You feel like the whole world has made you the ugly girl
Take it from me that you have to see it first

So before you trade in your summer skin for those high heeled shoes
To make 'em wanna be with you
Let me remind you one more time
That just maybe you're beautiful but you just can't see
So why don't you trust me
They'll see it too you beautiful girl, you

You wanna lay the blame on somebody else
All those tiny little minds that leave you up on a shelf
Well okay, I've seen it done that way

Just in case nobody ever comes through
Riding in to come to your rescue
You still a chance
You don't have to be asked to dance

I know how much you've been dying to say
"look how much everybody loves me"
Guess who gets left when everyone else fades away

So before you trade in your summer skin for those high heeled shoes
To make 'em wanna be with you
Let me remind you one more time
That just maybe you're beautiful but you just can't see
So why don't you trust me
They'll see it too you beautiful girl, you
You beautiful girl, you
You beautiful girl, you
Oooooh ooo ooo, Wooooh ooo ooo
Mmmmm mm hmmmmm
End
