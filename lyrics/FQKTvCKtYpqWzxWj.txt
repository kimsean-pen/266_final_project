Just ahead I see you winding up
And you're dressing this of color on the edge of fire
Until these tightened strides
They march in time again
I don't know where I will go

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if I will cut through
I don't know, I don't know, if my heart will beat without you

Guiding it, winding up
Leading me, winding up to explode

It's the sound your racing heart
That beats in time with every start
Reaches up and across the sky
It makes you want to rise

Falling to pieces, I can't let go
Tearing apart your lies
Wanting to live

Its the sound of your shotgun pulse
Beating over and over in your silent halls
Its the thought that keeps us alive
It makes us want to try

Falling to pieces, I can't let go
Tearing apart your lies
I want to live

A scream to guide me
Through my life
Winding up, Guiding me
Winding up to what you cannot unwind this side of you
And if its taken away you wont know what to do
Your streatching to meet expectations
That you will never reach

And now its far too late, and now its far too late
Far too late, to ever leave this cold
I'm giving up, marching in time with their drums
I'm letting go of everything I once loved
