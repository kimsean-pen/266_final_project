It's a strange feeling that i have
It's a weird a being that i am

It's an odd notion that i've known
It's a tear that i shed alone

It's better for me, better for me
Better for you, better for you
If we just do what we came to

Seperately, seperately
It's better for me, better for me
Definitely, sorry but i'm right

Would i be so drawn to solitude
If i was more of a solid dude?

Was a cold day that i was born
Wish that i wasn't quite so torn, torn but it's

Better for me, better for me
Better for you, better for you
If we just do what we came to

Seperately, seperately
It's better for me, better for me
Definitely, sorry but i'm right.
Sorry but i'm right
Sorry but i'm right
It's better for me, better for me
Better for you, better for you
If we just do what we came to
Seperately, seperately
It's better for me, better for me
Definitely, sorry but i'm right.
