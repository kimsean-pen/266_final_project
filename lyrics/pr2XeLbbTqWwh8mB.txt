You are my ocean
Of liquid bowels
I feed on your heart
Floating within flesh and blood

Host, I beg you not to free me
Host, I beg you not to free me

Keep me from the light shining through my skin
Cover me with your body, mother

Me, who I am your parasite
Of love and instinct
Me, who I am your parasite
Of love and instinct

Your beauty is divine
Goddess

The gift you made me, take it back

Take back every cell
So I can remain in you
Take back every cell
So I can remain in you
