This door is always open, this door is always open
No one has the guts to shut us out
But if we have to go now I guess there's always hope that
Some place will be serving after hours

This night is winding down but time means nothing
As always at this hour time means nothing
One final, final round 'cause time means nothing
Say that you'll stay, say that you'll stay

We're finally drunk enough that we're finally soaking up
The hours that everyone else throws away
And if we have to go now, I guess there's always hope
Tomorrow night will be more of the same

This night is winding down but time means nothing
As always at this hour time means nothing
One final, final round 'cause time means nothing
Say that you'll stay, say that you'll stay, say that you'll stay

We're all right where we're supposed to be
We're all right where we're supposed to be
We're all right where we're supposed to be
(Time means nothing)
We're all right where we're supposed to be
(Time means nothing)

This door is always open, this door is always open
No one has the guts to shut us out
(No one has the guts to shut us out)

Time means nothing, time means nothing
One final, final round 'cause time means nothing
Say that you'll stay, say that you'll stay, say that you'll stay
