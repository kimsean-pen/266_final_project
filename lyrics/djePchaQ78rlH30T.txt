Circles 'round the moon,
is this why city lights feel so awful?
It should be unlawful
to live where you can't see the stars.

Hundreds of miles away we draw the
same lines to conclusions.
There's no need for confusion
if we all throw in a towel.

But, down the street from here
there's a forest and a lake
I go there when my brain's too full
to try to break down, un-complicate.
To try to interpret the things
we said in letters and phone calls.

Not enough for us to tell,
how was your day?

Circles 'round the block,
is this how all my time gets wasted?
I don't think so,
but we tasted the night air
and now we just want more.

Thousand postcards later, we seem older but that's normal.
Our cars broke down
and its just too cold to hitchhike
to your door.

But, down the street from here there's a forest and a lake.
