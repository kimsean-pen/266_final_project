This is where you want to be
Failed to me, I didn't know
Is it what you really think?
I hope you're clear, I want to grow

You and me in the end
We feel the same, we feel the same
Even in the end
In the end we feel the same
We feel the same

And when we begin with cleaner hands
We couldn't know
Nothing left to blame, it stays the same
A hand full of gold

You and me in the end
We feel the same, we feel the same
Even in the end
In the end we feel the same
We feel the same
Feel the same, feel the same
Feel the same, feel the same
Feel the same, feel the same...
