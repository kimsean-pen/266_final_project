Imagine, the girls around town assemble
The traveler's son they come asking
Where he came from 'cause they've watched him
Washing his face near the pond
A curious boy and they wonder
Where he came from, he says I
I have seen the world's most beautiful places
Still I feel
As if I'm a walking machine
Watching it all through a screen
There ain't no thing in between
To me, this might as well not be real

Imagine, the girls take him up on a hill
It's an indigo night, there's a chill
The boy's confused but he's still
As they gather around him
So many of them they all sing
'Bout the pleasures of life and he cries
Why can't I sing along with some feeling
Or some meaning
It feels like I've always been blind
I don't know why you girls are so kind
For there are so many in line
Who's lives aren't as lost as mine

Now something happened there
The smell of the grass
Maybe the air
There was no more dispair
Just something about that night
Maybe the girls lit it some light
And did everything right
'Cause he's never been more alive
