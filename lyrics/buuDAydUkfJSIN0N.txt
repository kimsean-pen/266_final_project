I believe
You could be
What I need
To believe

I believe
You could be
What I need
To believe

I believe
You could be
What I need
To believe

I believe
You could be
What I need
To believe

It's the same old song
That I always sing each year
But because it's perennial don't make it less real

And I believe
That she could be
What I need
To believe

I believe (I believe)
You could be
What I need
To believe

I believe
You could be
What I need (Oh just keeps)
To believe (coming round again)

I believe
You could be
What I need (It just keeps)
To believe (coming round again)

I believe
You could be
What I need
To believe (It just keeps coming round again)

The conclusion I need is easily reached with you
You have given me all and there's nothing left to do

And I believe
That she could be
What I need
To believe

I believe
Just keeps coming round again

I believe
You could be
What I need (Just keeps)
To believe (coming round again)

I believe
You could be
What I need (It just keeps)
To believe (coming round again)

I believe
You could be
What I need (It just keeps)
To believe (coming round again)

I believe
You could be
What I need
To believe
