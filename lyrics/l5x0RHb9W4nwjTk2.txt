We thought we were the best show on Earth
Two kids running 'round kicking up dirt
Falling, flying
Big top love in a little old town
When you're high on walking don't you dare look down
And tease the lions
Ooh oh oh, you toss love around like a joggling act
Ooh oh oh, you put your heart in a can and then you didn't look back
Just when I thought I have hit one day
Just like that, heaven was packed and gone away
All you left was a feel to dust
You runaway circus

You talked me in a ticket for two
Payed with my heart for grand stand view
But the start attraction was smoking magic
Ooh oh, you toss love around like a joggling act
Ooh oh, you put your heart in a can and then you didn't look back
Just when I thought I have hit one day
Just like that heaven was packed and gone away
All you left was a feel to dust
You runaway circus

Ooh oh, ooh oh oh

Oooh you toss love around like a joggling act
Ooh oh oh, you put your heart in a can and then you didn't look back!
Just when I thought I have hit one day
Just like that, heaven was packed and gone away
All you left was a feel to dust
You runaway circus
You runaway circus
Runaway circus
