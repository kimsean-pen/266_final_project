Blind eye run in circle, seals your fate
Bow down to the one, you create

Try to tell you one thing
I try to tell you why
Try to show you somethin'
As you sit by

Safe, inside
Hover high seein' down below
Safe, inside
Intelligent worship alone

Blank mind in your eyes, you exist
Tell me what you see, somethin' I missed

Try to tell you one thing
Try to tell you why
Try to show you somethin'
As you sit by

Safe, inside
Hover high seein' down below
Safe, inside
Intelligent worship alone

Tell yourself, you're safe inside
Thinkin' back, you wonder why

Tell yourself you're safe inside
Safe inside, safe inside
Safe inside, safe inside
Safe inside, safe inside
Safe inside, safe inside

Bow down to the one you create
Bow down to the one you create
