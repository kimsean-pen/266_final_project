I'm a touch fast
Though I'll be last
To play with the heart from the start
I'll be straight

The second best boy
Unless like the rest boy
I'll stick around in the house of your mind
At the gate

And I never thought they'd get to you
So tell me have they gotten to you, too?
Did you tell them what they wanted to know?
Did you show them what I wanted to show, you?

And it's coming undone
So I run and I run
But there's nowhere left worth
Running to
It's hopeless at best
But what do we get?
A sense of regret which feels like
Nothing new

I'm the white ash
From the smoke stack
Helplessly floating from embers
That create
Troubled at best, boy
Another decoy
Dipping my hat to the man
Fanning the flame

I never thought they could get you to crack
So tell me how they got me to crack, you
Did you really think you could trust
Such a man with a head full of rust, too?

As it was coming undone
I could have told you to run
But I searched and I yearned for that pill
To get me through

And I'm helpless at best
Equal to the rest
I'll always forget
Not to be blue
