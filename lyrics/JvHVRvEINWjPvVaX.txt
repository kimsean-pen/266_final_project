Get the idea, cross around the track
When you reap the flank of a thoroughbred racing chaser
Get the feel as the rhythm flows
Would you like to go and shoot the mountain masses

And here you stand no taller than the grass sees
And should you really chase so hard
The truth of sport plays rings around you

Going for the one
Going for the one

Get in the way as the tons of water
Racing with you crash into your rudders
Once at the start can you gamble that
You really surely really mean to finish

After seeing all your sense of fear diminish
As you treat danger as pure collection
As you throw away misconception

Going for the one
Going for the one
Going for a listen in time
Taken so high
To touch, to move
Listen to life
Touching, touch time
Travel, twilight
Taken so high
Roundabout, sounding out
Love me so

Now the verses I've sang don't add much weight to the story in my head
So I'm thinking I should go and write a punchline
But they're so hard to find in my cosmic mind
So I think I'll take a look out of the window

When I think about you, I don't feel low
Should I really chase so hard
The truth of sport plays rings around you

Going for the one
Going for the one
Going for to listen in time
Taken so high
To touch, to move
Listen to life
Touching, touch time
Travel, twilight
Taken so high
Taking your time
Turn on to love
Turnstile to one
Tender timing
Rocking, rolling
Listen in time
Taken so high
To touch, to move
Listen to life
Touching, touch time
Travel, twilight
Taken so high
Taking your time
Turn on to love
Turnstile to one
Tender timing
Rocking, rolling
Turn on to love
Turnstile to one
Tender timing
Rocking, rolling
Moments decide
Moments delight
Moments in flight
Talk about sending love
Love...
Love...
Love...
Love
