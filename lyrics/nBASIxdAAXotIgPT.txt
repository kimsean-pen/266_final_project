Riding a river over the creek.
Climbing a mountain, crossing a stream.
Only in dreams, only in dreams.
Could I ever see this, only in dreams.

Down in the forest air is so clean.
Walking through nature I have never seen,
Or even knew was here.

Cat, bird, and deer all live together.

I can't believe it air is so clean,
Walking through nature I have never seen.

Everything's so beautiful... In full colour.

Been out of the city for over two weeks,
Almost forgotten the sadness it breeds
Work for a leader that no one has seen,
Stare at a screen that feeds on your dreams.

Out in the nature air is so clean,
looking at creatures I have never seen,
And couldn't even name.

And they speak our language, and they speak saying:

"Everything's so beautiful... In full colour."
Never thought I'd see the sky, with bare eyes.

Tall grass is everywhere.
This could end the suffering.

Before you know you'll find a home
Where nature grows in complex forms,
And stretches far beyond the sea.
The lake is ours lets make it breathe

Before you know
You will soon find a home
Where nature grows.
