On the day I went away, goodbye
Was all I had to say, now I
I want to come again and stay, oh my my
Smile, and that will mean that I may

Cause I've seen blue skies, through the tears
In my eyes
And I realise, I'm going home.

Everywhere it's been the same, feeling
Like I'm outside in the rain, wheeling
Free, to try and find a game, dealing
Cards for sorrow, cards for pain

'Cause I've seen blue skies through the tears
In my eyes
And I realise, I'm going home.

I'm going home, I'm going home.
