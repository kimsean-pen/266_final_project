Oh, yeah
They say in this world, nothing lasts forever
But I don't believe that's true
Cause the way that I feel
When we are together
I know that's the way, I always feel for you

From now until forever
That's how long I'll be true
I'll make you this vow
And promise you now
Until forever
I'll never stop loving you

Then will come a day when the world stops turning
And stars will fall from the sky
But this feeling will last
When the suns start burning
But all I wanna do is love you
Until the end of time

From now until forever
That's how long I'll be true
I'll make you this vow
And promise you now
Until forever
I'll never stop loving you

It's gonna take more than a lifetime
To give you all the love (all the love)
I feel for you tonight

From now until forever
That's how long I'll be true
I'll make you this vow
And promise you now
Until forever
I'll never stop loving you

From now until forever
That's how long I'll be true
I'll make you this vow
And promise you now
Until forever
I'll never stop loving you
Until forever
I'll never stop loving you
