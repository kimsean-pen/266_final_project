The commander is calling home to tell the news
It isn't good, I am afraid to say
Today's the day you have been dreading for so many years
It's almost like you have been saving up the tears
Remembering the words

You to me, are encased in nothing
But beauty and gracious love
You'll always be my one good reason
To keep on moving 'til I'm in your arms

My favorite place is wherever you are
But I don't know where you are

Now this ugly point of view keeps creeping up to say
It's all his fault you feel this way
But that won't help and it's not right to think that anyway
Well, god damn, why did this have to happen anyway?
Why'd you have to leave across the sea?
Where I can't reach you and hold you, protect you the way I need

You'll always be my one good reason
To keep on moving 'til I'm in your arms
My favorite place is wherever you are
But I don't know where you are
My favorite place is wherever you are
But I don't know where you are

I don't know where you are
I don't know where you are

Now this crack beneath the ocean floor
It calls it way up to me
And when I sleep I don't know why
But it suggests I should come find it
So when I wake I don't know where I am
I fumble all around into the dark
And in an awful moment I realize I've lost you

I keep thinking you're hiding somewhere only I can see
But I wake to find you nowhere and I'm tearing at my sheets
I keep thinking you're hiding somewhere only I can see
But I wake to find you nowhere and I'm tearing at my sheets

I don't know where you are
I don't know where you are
