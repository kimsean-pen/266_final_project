(phillips, lee)

I got my mat
I'm gonna take a dive
I might get wet
But I'll still be alive
It only cost 3 bones
To prove my masculinity
But when I'm riding I'm free

I'm on the waterslide
(woh-oh)
I'm on the waterslide
(let's go)
I'm on the waterslide
Watch me go

In the shoot
I'll do the loop to loop

But in the end
I'll wind up in the soup
Last one to finish
Has to pay for every ride
But if I'm last you'll let me slide

Chorus

Lead

Chorus

Go down backwards on the waterslide

Lane 5 on the waterslide

Lane 6 on the waterslide

I'm getting wet on the waterlide
