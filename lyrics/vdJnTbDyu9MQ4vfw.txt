I swear, I swear, I'm hurting, babe
I just don't understand
Handed you my heart, somewhere in the dark
In the drop
Missed a couple parts, then it stopped
But the beat changed
I can't think straight, yeah
Like a work of art, lookin' at my heart
On the wall, tell me what it mean to ya, he say she say

I tried to explain
But words are just words, no difference
Still love in my heart, it's not the same
It's just different

And you break my heart
You got it to start
No surprise, do it every time
Then you go for a joy ride on your side
Actin' like I'm not lovin' every drop
Then we fall, Pull over the car
Goin' wild, free way
If they see me

I tried to explain
But words are just words, can't quit this
The love in my heart is not the same
It's different
It's different

Know you, know you hurtinG baby
Just don't understand
(Just don't understand)
I swear, I swear (I swear, I swear)
Just don't understand
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
