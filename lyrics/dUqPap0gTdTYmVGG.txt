Hope you keep
A penny in your pocket for me
Heads up for love
'Cause I need it
'Cause I need it

I'm not yours to play with
I'm not yours to
I can't sleep when I'm uneasy
I get in my head
Please believe me

I know I'll find
I know I'll find
One of my kind

I won't do what I'm told
Help me unfold, I
Need to unfold

I've been tired of hearing things
Speeches, needless to say
I'm in love with you
