Dancing on the crumbling precipice
The rocks are coming loose just at the edge
Are we laughing? Are we crying?
Are we drowning? Are we dead?
Or was it all a dream?

The bombs are getting closer everyday
'That can never happen here' we used to say
Have these wars come to our doorstep?
Has this moment finally come?
Or was it all a dream?

Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough or was it all a dream?

To a predetermined fate, are we condemned?
Or maybe we're a book without an end?
We're not stories, we're not actors
We're awake and in control
And this is not a dream

So can we break this mold?
And set in motion something new
Forgetting what we know
An evolution overdue
Fight the current
Pull the ripcord
Get away!

Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough?

We travel back to what we take
We need a storm; let's pray for rain now
To wash these roads away
Let's get off track and wander far
Same roads reducing destinations
Do nothing but show our heart
We're talking in our sleep
And sleeping through our lives
We dream of the places where we never die
We step from our shadows
And into the light

Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
Are we not good, good enough?
Or was it all a dream?
