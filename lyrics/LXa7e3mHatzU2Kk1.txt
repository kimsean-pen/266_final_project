It's the same old story in this tug of war
We go back and forth, we go back and forth
But it ain't good for me, what we do this for?
We go back and forth, walk through this road
Oh, whoa (we go back and forth, we go back and forth)
Oh, whoa (we go back and forth, walk through this road)

All, all we, all, all, always never tell her
All, all we, all, all, always never tell her
All, all we, all, all, always never tell her
All, all we, all, all, always never tell her

You're only nice when you wanna be
You always leave me wondering, wondering
It's not as simple as, you and me
Can never tell if I'm in love with him or lost with him
Tryna find an in-between, it's all, it's all or nothing
You pull me back when you feel me
slip away, deceive me with your loving

It's the same old story in this tug of war
We go back and forth, we go back and forth
But it ain't good for me, what we do this for?
We go back and forth, walk through this road
Oh, whoa (we go back and forth, we go back and forth)
Oh, whoa (we go back and forth, walk through this road)

All, all we, all, all, always never tell her
All, all we, all, all, always never tell her
All, all we, all, all, always never tell her
All, all we, all, all, always never tell her

Being with you, there's no reasoning
At home we're fighting all the time, all the time
I'm tryna speak, you're not listening
Closed ears with open eyes, broken minds
Tryna find an in-between, it's all, it's all or nothing
Oh, you pull me back when you feel me
slip away, deceive me with your loving

It's the same old story in this tug of war
We go back and forth, we go back and forth
But it ain't good for me, what we do this for?
We go back and forth, walk through this road

All, all we, all, all, always never tell her
All, all we, all, all, always never tell her
All, all we, all, all, always never tell her
All, all we, all, all, always never tell her
All, all we, all, all
