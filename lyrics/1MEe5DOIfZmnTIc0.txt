I wish that I could float
Float up from the ground
I will never know
What that's like

You have a way about you
I wish that I had
Thought it was impossible
To live and love like you

Funny how we all can change
If we just try to
Thought it was impossible
To live and love like you

One day you will be taller
Taller than the sky
Until that day you will be
Here with us below

Magic will do what magic does
Living in your eyes
Do you think someday soon
You will have the time

I could use another hand
To help pull me through
Someday these hospital stays
Get the best of me
Trying to fix my mind

Still trying to fix my mind
Trying to work it out
I'm still trying to fix my mind
Still trying to fix my mind
I'm still trying to fix my mind
