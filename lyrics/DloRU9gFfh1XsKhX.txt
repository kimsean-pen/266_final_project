Find out
You dirty fucker
They say everything is fine now
They're wrong!
Fine, die

The badges are a nightmare
It don't seem right to me
It doesn't seem ready to me

Your dad is going to find out
us on the light
Find out

The party is over right now
It don't seem right to me
It doesn't seem ready to me

I say we ought to fight now, right now
Bring the party to the night now, find out
Bring the party to the knife now
It don't seem right to me
Picard has seen everything
