Echo in my dreams
Echo in my dreams
Echo in my dreams
Crawling through the depths of you
Coming over me
Drifting in the deep

Emerge within me
Fade into the galaxy
Emerge within me
Drift into the deep

Wrapped in revery
Castles floating in the sea
Dare me to believe
I'm drifting in the deep

Echo in my dreams
Echo in my dreams
