If I fall short
If I don't
Make the grades

If your expectations
Aren't met in me
There is always
Tomorrow
Or
Tomorrow night

Hang in there baby
Sooner
Or later
I know
I'll get it right

Please, don't give
Up on me
Oh please don't
Give up on me

I know its late,
Late in the game
But my feelings
My true feelings
Haven't changed
Here in my heart

I know
I know
I was wrong
Wrong wrong, wrong
Wrong, wrong

I'd like to make
A mends:
For the love
That I never
Ever, ever
Ever shown:
Just don't give up
On me
Every word is true

I'll give you my
Everything
All of my love
All of my love
All of my love
Love, love:
Just don't give up on me
Oh please
Please
Please
Don't give up on me

IIIYYYee
Don't want you to
I know its late
But wait
Please
Please
Please, please
Don't give up on me
Promise?
Will you promise me?
Will you promise me?
Please
Don't give up on me

We can make it if we try
I'm gonna hold on
Hold on with me
And don't give up on me

Heeeeheeee
Oh-ooh-oohohoooh
Baby
Oh baby
Oh baby

Don't-give-up-on-me
Whatever you do
We gonna make it
Will make it through:

Don't you give up on me
Please
Please, please...
Promise me
Don't-give-up-on-me
