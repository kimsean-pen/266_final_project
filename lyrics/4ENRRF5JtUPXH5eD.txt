Hunger drives me
It's got me by the rails
I let it wreck me
Time and time again

I decided
To never write again
I don't know
What happened

Dad, I broke my promise to you,
If you're wondering where I've been
Thought I knew what I was doing
But I was wrong again

I understand, son
I understand, son
I understand

The fairer gender
They always turn my head
From sheer embarassment
I'm nearly dead

Dad, I broke my promise to you,
If you're wondering where I've been
Thought I knew what I was doing
But I was wrong again

I understand, son
I understand, son
I understand
