Well, Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
And he's gonna start a war
He's gonna start a war

And he hops in his pickup
Puts his pedal to the floor
And says, "I got mine
But I want more"

Because Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He drove the desert, fired his rifle in the sky
And said, "God, if I have to die, you will have to die"

Because Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He didn't move to the city
The city moved to me
And I want out desperately

Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Don't know, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over

Standing in the tall grass
Thinking nothing
You know we need oxygen to breathe
Oxygen to breathe

Standing in the tall grass
Thinking nothing
You know we need oxygen to breathe
Oxygen to breathe

Every time you think you're walking, you're just moving the ground
Every time you think you're talking, you're just moving your mouth
Every time you think you're looking, you're just looking down

Well, Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He hops in his pickup, puts the pedal to the floor
And says, "I got mine, but I want more"

'Cause Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He drove the desert, fired his rifle in the sky
And said, "God, if I have to die, you will have to die"

Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He didn't move to the city, the city moved to me
And I want out desperately

Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
No, no, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Yeah, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
