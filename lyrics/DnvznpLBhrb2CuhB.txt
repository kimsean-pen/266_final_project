Today I saw my hero fall apart
The one who taught me to be strong
On the outside I look fine
But on the inside I am dyin'
My strength is overcome by pain
My love for you remains the same
The loneliness is setting in
I have no one to free my sins

It's never too late to live your life
The time is now, it's do or die
It's never too late to live your life
The time is now, it's yours and mine

Now it's my time to help you out
'Cause you were there when I was down
It's hard for me to see you this way
Losing all your sanity
You helped me keep my dreams alive
Without you, how will I survive?
It's time for me to be a man
Now I finally understand

It's never too late to live your life
The time is now, it's do or die
It's never too late to live your life
The time is now, it's yours and mine

It's never too late to live your life
(Live your life)
The time is now, it's do or die
It's never too late to live your life
(Live your life)
The time is now, it's yours and mine

I can't run anymore
I can't hide anymore
I can't run anymore
I can't hide anymore

Today I saw my hero fall apart
The one who taught me to be strong
On the outside I look fine
But on the inside I am dyin'

It's never too late to live your life
The time is now, it's do or die
It's never too late to live your life
The time is now, it's yours and mine

It's never too late to live your life
(Live your life)
The time is now, it's do or die
It's never too late to live your life
(Live your life)
The time is now, it's yours and mine

It's never too late to live your life
(Live your life)
The time is now, it's do or die
It's never too late to live your life
(Live your life)
The time is now, it's yours and mine
I can't run anymore
I can't hide anymore
I can't run anymore
I can't hide anymore
Yeah
