Gone an left me
Left me here to cry
Now I love her
Know she's my desire
Know she's my desire
Know she's my desire
Know she's my desire
Know she's my desire

Came home this mo'nin
'Bout half past four
Found that note
Lyin' on my floor
"Goin' away and leave you
You just don't know."

Heard some bad talk
Somethin' that you said
Somethin' that you said
Somethin' that you said>

Come on back, baby
Honey, please don't go
Well, I love you
You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know

My kind-a baby
You know it's so
I could tell you
You know it ain't no joke
Know it ain't no joke

Come on back, baby
Don't do me wrong
You know I love you
Please, come back home
Come on back home
FADES-
Come on back home
Come on back home.
