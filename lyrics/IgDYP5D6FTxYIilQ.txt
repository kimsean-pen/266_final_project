Face me and embrace the pressure
We were made for another time
(When you need me I'll be there)
(Say my name, yeah, I'm right here)
Let's drift away in fits of pleasure
You're a beautiful design
(Say you need me, face your fears)
(Say my name, yeah, I'm right here)
Yeah, I'm just floating with my hands up
All street and gold dust
Caught up in the fluff fat
Tell me when I've crossed the line
(When you need me I'll be there)
(Say my name and I'll appear)
Been living in another fall
Trash caught me tripping out
Love, please open up
I've been gone too long
(When you need me I'll appear)
(Say my name, yeah, I'm right here)

I'll fall into you and you'll give in to me
You can be my only woman whose control I won't hold back
And we can live in the truth, or chasing a dream
Just giving up both, yeah, giving up control

I've been looking for an answer
I've been running out of time
I've been looking for an answer
I've been waiting for a sign
Just say that you'll be there

Free your self-reflective color
Yeah, I know how to make you shine
(When you need me I'll be there)
(Say my name, yeah, I'm right here)
Face your fate you pretty faker
Lay back and catch the light
(Say you need me, face your fears)
(Say my name, yeah, I'm right here)
Yeah, I'm just floating with my hands up
All street and gold dust
Love, please open up
Yeah, I've been gone too long
When I drift away it feels so wrong

I'll fall into you and you'll give in to me
You can be my only woman whose control I won't hold back
And we're livin' the truth, or chasing a dream
Just giving up both, yeah, giving up control

(Just say that you'll be there)
(Just say that you'll be there)

I'll fall into you, just give in to me
This will be my only
I'll fall into you, just give in to me
Yeah, I'm giving up control, now I'm giving up control
This will be my only
Yeah, I'm giving up control
