I've lost all my pride
I've been to paradise
and out the other side

With no one to guide me
Torn apart by a fire wheel inside me

I wont hurt you
I wont hurt you
I wont hurt you
I wont hurt you

An untouched diamond
that's golden and brilliant
without illumination

Your mouth is constellation
the stars are in your eyes
I'll take a spaceship and try and go and find you

I wont hurt you
I wont hurt you
I wont hurt you
I wont hurt you

My pale blue star
my rainbow how good it is
to know you are like me

Strike me with you lightning
bring me down and burry me
with ashes

I wont hurt you
I wont hurt you
I wont hurt you
I wont hurt you
I wont hurt you
I wont hurt you
I wont hurt you
I wont hurt you
