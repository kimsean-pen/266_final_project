Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid

No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep

But still I had to keep on going

Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night

I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

If you believe in yourself enough

And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen

And if you get down on your knees at night

And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
You're gonna make it happen, ho yeah

I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong

Baby just hold on

You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away

I used to feel the way you do
Still I had to keep on going

Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen, make it happen, yes
Make it
You're gonna make it
Make it
Oh, make it
Oh, make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And finally found a way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen, yes, he is
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
I once was lost
But now I'm found
I got my feet
On solid ground
Thank you, Lord
If you believe
Within your soul
Just hold on tight
And don't let go
You can make it
Make it happen
Yeah, you can make it
Make it happen
Gonna make it, gonna make it
You're gonna make it
Gonna make it, gonna make it
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
