Early in the morning when the sun does rise
Laying in the bed with blood shot eyes
Late in the evening when the sun sinks low
That's about time my rooster crows

I've got women up and down this creek
Where to keep me going and my engine clean
Run me ragged but I don't fret
'Cause there ain't been one slow me down just yet

Get me drinking that moonshine
Get me higher than a grocery bill
Take my troubles to the high wall
Throw them in the river and get your fill

We've been sniffing that cocaine
Ain't nothing better when the wind cuts cold
Lord it's a mighty hard living
But a damn good feeling to run these roads

I got people trying to tell me Red
Keep this living and you wind up dead
Cast your troubles on the lord of lords
Wind up lying on the cooling board

But I got buddies up at white house road
They keep me strutting when my feet hang low
Rot gut whiskey gonna ease my pain
And all this running is gonna keep me sane

Get me drinking that moonshine
Get me higher than a grocery bill
Take my troubles to the high wall
Throw them in the river and get your fill

We've been sniffing that cocaine
Ain't nothing better when the wind cuts cold
Lord it's a mighty hard living
But a damn good feeling to run these roads
It's a damn good feeling to run these roads

When you lay me in the cold hard clay
Wont you sing them hymns while the banjo plays?
We could tell those ladies that they ought not frown
'Cause there ain't been nothing ever held me down
Lawman, women or a shallow grave
Same old blues just a different day

Get me drinking that moonshine
Get me higher than a grocery bill
Take my troubles to the high wall
Throw them in the river and get your fill

We've been sniffing that cocaine
Ain't nothing better when the wind cuts cold
Lord it's a mighty hard living
But a damn good feeling to run these roads
It's a damn good feeling to run these roads
It's a damn good feeling to run these roads
