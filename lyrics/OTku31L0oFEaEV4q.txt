Pretty boy looking over
Pretty girl gets the boys
Pretty things can be evil
Pretty tough to avoid
Pretty hard on it eight days a week
Causing a fuss up in the big city
Eight days a week, eight days a week sucker
Eight days a week

Spilling drinks down my shirt, wasted
Hooligan trying to flirt, basic
Home on my own
Let the good times roll
Yeah I'm far too gone
But now she wanna talk to me
Thing about foreigners they
Taking our jobs we should send 'em away
I can't believe what I heard
How she's saying these words
But I'm far too gone

You should let me love you
I could make you change I could
I would like to love you
Try to fix your brain, turn it bad to good

Eight days a week, eight days a week sucker
Eight days a week
Eight days a week sucker, eight days a week

And now the party's in full swing
Dawns on me I have mostly been
Spending my time with this person I don't like
Just because they're very good looking

How did we, did we get so high?
How did we, did we get so high?
How did we, did we get so high?
How did we, did we get so high?
How did we, did we get so high?
How did we, did we get so high?
How the hell did we get so high?
How the hell did we get so high?

You should let me love you
I could make you change, I could
I would like to love you
Try to fix your brain, turn it bad to good

Pretty hard on it eight days a week
Causing a fuss up in the big city
Eight days a week, eight days a week sucker
Eight days a week

Eight days a week sucker, eight days a week
I could make you change
I could fix your brain, yeah

I could make you change
I could fix your brain

Eight days a week
Eight days a week, sucker
