I wait for the postman to bring me a letter
And I wait for the good Lord to make me feel better
And I carry the weight of the world on my shoulders
A family in crisis that only grows older

Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?

Daughter to father, daughter to father
I am broken but I am hoping
Daughter to father, daughter to father
I am cryin', a part of me's dyin'
And these are, these are
The confessions of a broken heart

And I wear all your old clothes, your polo sweater
I dream of another you, one who would never
Never leave me alone to pick up the pieces
A daddy to hold me, that's what I needed

So why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?

Daughter to father, daughter to father
I don't know you, but I still want to
Daughter to father, daughter to father
Tell me the truth, did you ever love me?
Cause these are, these are
The confessions of a broken heart, of a broken heart

I love you
I love you
I love you
I, I, I, I love you

Daughter to father, daughter to father
I don't know you, but I still want to
Daughter to father, daughter to father
Tell me the truth, did you ever love me?
Did you ever love me?
These are the confessions of a broken heart
Oh yeah

I wait for the postman to bring me a letter
