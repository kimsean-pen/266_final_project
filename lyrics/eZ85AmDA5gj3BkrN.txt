If I dove right in
Would you meet me at the bottom?
Could you calm my sins,
and turn wine into wate?
Teach me how to swim,
how to stay on the surface
If I dove right in,
would you do me in (Ooh)

Take me to the water
You can hold me under
Take me to the water
You can hold me under
Take me to the water
You can hold me under
Take me to the water
You can hold me under

You let me in
I caught on fire
Crawled in my skin
I pulled you tighter
When you come closer,
the air get's hotter
Break down my armor
I want you to

Take me to the water
You can hold me under
Take me to the water
You can hold me under

Take me to the water
You can hold me
Take me to the water
You can hold me undere under
Take me to the water
You can hold me under
Take me to the water
You can hold me under
