Dark town, it's no good for us
Secret shadows behind everyone
All these people feed on broken hearts
Try to leave, but you're stuck where you came from

You complain, but it's useless
You could take control, but

Oh, I know
There's always reasons why you came so close
But never made it far away from home
You're stuck in automatic
You're sleeping through the static
I know it's hard, but baby

Oh, you make excuses, but it's you
No one can fix what you've been through
You're stuck in automatic
You're sleeping through the static
I know it's hard, but it's on you

Your demons make it hard to open up
You always cared, but never too much
You wear a mask, but I call your bluff
Try to leap, but you're scared 'cause it's dangerous
You complain, but it's useless
You could take control, but

You complain, but it's useless
You could take control, but

Oh, I know
There's always reasons why you came so close
But never made it far away from home
You're stuck in automatic
You're sleeping through the static
I know it's hard, but baby

Oh, you make excuses, but it's you
No one can fix what you've been through
You're stuck in automatic
You're sleeping through the static
I know it's hard, but it's on you
