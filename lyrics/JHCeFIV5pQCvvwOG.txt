Come to the darkness
Someone is waiting for you
Bring all your imagination
It feels like there's another side of you

You are good enough
Cannot feel small
You're better than a thousand girls
We love the way you improvise
So stop saying that...

Everytime you pray or ask for something new
You just hear the same old "no"

Drunk in a desert
Nobody cares about you now
All your "do's and dont's"
Won't help you find your way back home

You like the sun
Like the miracle on your own
