You look at me
As if you thought I was cool too
I know what you want
It's not that hard to understand

Take your words
Your words your manners
They mean that much to me
Sell my world
Descends abandoning
I have no one I know

You look at me
As if you never knew my face
So here I go
Back into my single malaise
