Bring me back the time
Because we know you're special
And we think you know you're wrong
Bring me back the time
Because we know you're special
And we think you know you're wrong
Suckerface you're special

Do you believe yourself, it's not science
Do you hide from your reflection
Do you believe yourself to be
Number one in the world-electric

Do you believe yourself, it's not science
Do you hide from your reflection
Do you believe yourself to be
Number one in the world-electric

Raised by the queens your mother paid
So how does that make you a human god
And all the ladies want you
And sometimes gentlemen too
And still we think you know you're wrong
Suckerface you're special

Do you believe yourself, it's not science
Do you hide from your reflection
Do you believe yourself to be
Number one in the world-electric

Do you believe yourself, it's not science
Do you hide from your reflection
Do you believe yourself to be
Number one in the world-electric
