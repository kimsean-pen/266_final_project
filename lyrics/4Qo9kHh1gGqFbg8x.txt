The pictures you paint,
The games that you play,
All turning in time to see,
The favors you pull,
The faces you know,
Nobody else calls to me,
Will you know what it is,
When you stand before it,
and your eyes will not wait to see?

When the night falls down,
and the fever it grows,
Nobody knows,
You're taking my mind all the time,
But it's never enough.

When you call me out,
You shake my doubt,
and the lights will come following,
But the moment you take,
The hearts that you break,

I'll turn to you instantly.
When the night falls down,
and the fever it grows,
Nobody knows,
You're taking my mind all the time,
But it's never enough.

Turning away too long I never had the choice to do it anyway,
Turning away too long I never had the chance to do it anyway.
