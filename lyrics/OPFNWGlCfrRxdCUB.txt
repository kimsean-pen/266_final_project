I'm weak as, I am young
Feel the feet I drag along
Please give me back my strength for this sorrow
And I'll try again tomorrow
But, I'm weighted by this stone
It hangs at the back of my throat

We don't have grace we are foolish inside
I'm not in my place and I'd like to know why most of all
But, its so hard to find out
Your minds are far better than mine
And I struggle with it all the time
Take my coat and have it for your own
Out there's a world that I've never been shown
It's on the outside but, its a river too wide
For I'm weighted by this stone
It hangs at the back of my throat
And it hurts me so
And it hurts me so
