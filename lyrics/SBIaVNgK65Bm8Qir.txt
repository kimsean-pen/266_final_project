It was an early morning yesterday
I was up before the dawn
And I really have enjoyed my stay
But I must be moving on
Like a king without a castle, like a queen without a throne
I'm an early morning lover and I must be moving on

Now I believe in what you say
Is the undisputed truth
But I have to have things my own way
To keep me in my youth
Like a ship without an anchor, like a slave without a chain
Just the thought of those sweet ladies sends a shiver through my veins
And I will go on shining, shining like brand new
I'll never look behind me, my troubles will be few

Goodbye stranger, it's been nice
Hope you'll find your paradise
Tried to see your point of view
Hope your dreams will all come true
Goodbye, Mary, goodbye, Jane
Will we ever meet again?
Feel no sorrow, feel no shame
Come tomorrow, feel no pain

Sweet devotion (Goodbye, Mary),
It's not for me (Goodbye, Jane)
Just give me motion (Will we ever)
And set me free (Meet again?)
And land and the ocean (Feel no sorrow),
Far away (Feel no shame)
The life I've chosen (Come tomorrow),
Every day (Feel no pain)
So goodbye, Mary (Goodbye, Mary),
Goodbye, Jane (Goodbye, Jane)
Will we ever (Will we ever)
Meet again? (Meet again?)

Now, some they do and some they don't
And some you just can't tell
And some they will and some they won't
With some it's just as well
You can laugh at my behaviour, that'll never bother me
Say, the devil is my saviour, but I don't pay no heed
And I will go on shining, shining like brand new
I'll never look behind me, my troubles will be few

Goodbye stranger, it's been nice
Hope you find your paradise
Tried to see your point of view
Hope your dreams will all come true
Goodbye, Mary, goodbye, Jane
Will we ever meet again?
Feel no sorrow, feel no shame
Come tomorrow, feel no pain

Sweet devotion (Goodbye, Mary),
It's not for me (Goodbye, Jane)
Just give me motion (Will we ever)
And set me free (Meet again?)
And land and the ocean (Feel no sorrow),
Far away (Feel no shame)
The life I've chosen (Come tomorrow),
Every day (Feel no pain)

And now I'm leaving (Goodbye, Mary)
Got to go (Goodbye, Jane)
Hit the road (Will we ever)
I say it once again (Meet again?)
Oh yes, I'm leaving (Feel no sorrow)
Got to go (Feel no shame)
Got to go (Come tomorrow)
I'm sorry I must tell you (Feel no pain)

Goodbye, Mary (Goodbye, Mary),
Goodbye, Jane (Goodbye, Jane)
Will we ever (Will we ever)
Meet again? (Meet again?)
