I want you shaking every time you hear my name*
I dream about it every hour, ever day.
And if you think its funny well you won't when I'm gone.
I like to see your love when I start dropping the bombs.
I want to bring you pain in each and every way.
I've got a reason for living and it's my love.

I know something's going on.
Baby, take a look at me now!
How long have you done me wrong?
You know time can take a lie and make it true.
I know something's going on.
Baby stay away from me now.
How long can you make it on your own?
Now it's time to say goodbye and it's on you.

I'm going to wreck your cars, set your house on fire.
I'll get elected tell the world that you're a liar.
If you think I'm crazy well I just don't care.
Why don't you come and try to shut me up if you dare.
You never had the kind of nightmares I'll supply.
I've got a reason to live and it's not love.

I know something's going on.
Baby took a look at me now.
How long have you done me wrong?
You know that time can take a lie and make it true.
I know something's going on.
Baby, stay away from me now!
How long can you make it on your own?
Now it's time to say goodbye and it's on you.
Don't try to make this about me.
Because you, you would be nowhere without me.
Without me.

I know something's going on.
Baby, take a look at me now!
How long have you done me wrong?
You know that time can take a lie and make it true.
I know something's going on.
Baby, stay away from me now!
How long can you make it on your own?
Now it's time to say goodbye and it's on you.
