Seems life forever
Like forever
Since I tore myself apart
And left my friends in the wake
Of countless tears and fading life.
When I couldn't seem to grasp the life I lead
And the lives I touch
Its one year on now

One year on, one year on
Still I struggle with the same demons
I shed as I laid there lost in my head
lost in my head

(Lost in this goddamn hospital bed)
I'm not the same man
And I don't dare try
(Try to uncover all the darkness I hide)
Its like my demons are my lovers

But I've got friends by my side
I've got hope in my eyes
And dreams to aspire too
And the whole wide world to watch below

And death won't be my lover
I've got so much left to give
And take my life with subtle steps
Instead of not wanting all that is left

Instead of trying to take my own life
Its one year on
And I'm stronger, I want to live much longer
Not grow old and bitter
And not jaded
And not hate what life gave me

Let the fear wash away
Let the demons blunt their claws
On a life that's full of mistakes
But always searching for much more

I won't die defeated
I won't die defeated
I won't die defeated
I won't die

Cause I've got friends by my side
I've got hope in my eyes
And dreams to aspire too
And the whole wide world to watch below

And death won't be my lover
I've got so much left to give
And take my life with subtle steps
Instead of not wanting all that is left

No, death won't be my lover
I've got so much left to give
And take my life with subtle steps
Instead of not wanting all that is left
