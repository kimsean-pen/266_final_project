And when I'm with you I can always act the same
Forever, yeah if we're together
We can make it better

You and I
We never get to sleep we're up all day
We're overworked and under paid
You and I
We're always stuck in repeat day by day
Watching time drift away as we burn away

Without you, there's no reason for my story
And when I'm with you I can always act the same
Forever, yeah if we're together
We can make it better

You and I
We've never felt so right
That just might be just what I need (to get me through the night)
You and I
We're the perfect fit you've got me hooked
So lit I could never never quit, I just burn away

Without you, there's no reason for my story
And when I'm with you I can always act the same
Forever, yeah if we're together
We can make it better

Without you, there's no reason for my story
And when I'm with you I can always act the same
Forever, yeah if we're together
We can make it... We can make it...

Without you, there's no reason for my story
And when I'm with you I can always act the same
Forever, yeah if we're together
We can make it... We can make it...
Without you, there's no reason for my story
And when I'm with you I can always act the same
Forever, yeah if we're together
We can make it better
