We spend the summer in town
Afraid of heights even when I'm down
We write our names in concrete
Afraid of lights when we ... under sheets

You just call when you feel alone
Make me fall every time you go
You just call when you feel alone
The night is young and my heart is yours

So holler at me boy don't be shy
Before I was even born you were mine
So holler at me boy one more time
You and me we are the same kind

We take the night before the sound
Buy big cars so ankles running out
We make the sun rise up dawn
Buy my house... if you are

You just call when you feel alone
Make me fall every time you go
You just call when you feel alone
The night is young and my heart is yours

So holler at me boy don't be shy
Before I was even born you were mine
So holler at me boy one more time
You and me we are the same kind

So holler at me boy don't be shy
Before I was even born you were mine
So holler at me boy one more time
You and me we are the same kind
