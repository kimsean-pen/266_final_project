This is the moment that I feared the most
Helplessly watching as we turn to ghosts
Is it over
Tell me if it's over
This is the hardest thing I've ever done
Hopelessly waiting as you turn and run
Is it over
Is it really over

I promised you that I would change
Then I broke it in a million ways
I alone take the blame
While you take everything
Why can't we start this over
What have we done to us
You say that you need closure
Are you just giving up on us

I refuse to fade away
As you try to forget me
Take my heart and walk away
Like you wish you never met me

Now that I know that you're not on my side
What good is love if it's always denied
Is it over
Is it really over

I swore to God that I could change
But I let you down a million ways
I alone take the blame
While you take everything
Why can't we start this over
What have we done to us
You say that you need closure
Are you just giving up on us

I refuse to fade away
As you try to forget me
Take my heart and walk away
Like you wish you never met me

Like you wish you never met me
Like you wish you never met me
Like you wish you never met me
Do you wish you never met me

Why can't we start this over
What have we done to us
You say that you need closure
Are you just giving up

Why can't we start this over
What have we done to us
You say that you need closure
Are you just giving up us

I refuse to fade away
As you try to forget me
Take my heart and walk away
Like you wish you never met me
I refuse to fade away
As you try to forget me
Take my heart and walk away
Like you wish you never met me
Like you wish you never met me
Like you wish you never met me
Like you wish you never met me
Do you wish you never met me
