Beep beep, oh oh
Beep beep, oh oh

I'm stuck in traffic, bumper to bumper, babe
My leather jacket smells like your aftershave
All I wanna do is get your hands up on my booty
(Beep beep, oh oh)

I blew my engine, I think I popped the stick
Too busy dreaming, of jumping on your {dick}
To get me turning good, you need to check under the hood babe
(Beep beep, oh oh)

Oh, baby, baby
There's something about your love and affection, oh oh oh, oh
I'm going crazy
The thought of you is driving me wild, ooh ooh ooh

'Cause I love, love, love, making love to you
But I'm stuck, stuck, stuck, on the 202
Won't you help me, help me?
Just want to {fuck} you tonight
Beep beep, oh oh
Baby, pump, pump, pump, 'cause I'm in a jam
Give me a jump, jump, jump, make it start again
Won't you help me, help me?
Just want to {fuck} you tonight
Beep beep, oh oh

Boy, you're so sexy, just like your Cadillac
Just come and get me, 'cause I can't hold it back
People on the street watch us in the backseat, oh
(Beep beep, oh oh)

Oh, baby, baby
There's something 'bout your love and affection, oh oh oh, oh
I'm going crazy
The thought of you is driving me wild, ooh ooh ooh

'Cause I love, love, love, making love to you
But I'm stuck, stuck, stuck, on the 202
Won't you help me, help me?
Just want to {fuck} you tonight
Beep beep, oh oh
Baby, pump, pump, pump, 'cause I'm in a jam
Give me a jump, jump, jump, make it start again
Won't you help me, help me?
(Just want to {fuck} you tonight)
Beep beep, oh oh

I'll push that pedal 'til it's gone through the floor
I'm burning reds like I would run from the law
I'll push that pedal 'til it's gone through the floor
I'm burning reds like I would run from the law

'Cause I love, love, love, making love to you
But I'm stuck, stuck, stuck, on the 202
Won't you help me, help me?
Just want to {fuck} you tonight
Beep beep, oh oh
Baby, pump, pump, pump, 'cause I'm in a jam
Give me a jump, jump, jump, make it start again
Won't you help me, help me?
(Just want to {fuck} you tonight)
Beep beep, oh oh

Can I have you baby?
Help me out,
