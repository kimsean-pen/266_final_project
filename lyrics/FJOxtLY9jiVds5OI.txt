Remember every move you make as if it was still true
Is that I am king that I feel brand new
‘Cause you're in my soul, can't let you go, fighting for you
And in my dreams I'll make you my pair
As we move close, and I grove with you
Blue and green rays they shine through
Feel the energy, you don't have to try
You can see it in our bodies, you can see it in our eyes
Watch me dance with this memory
Just as real, just as half for me
Watch me dance in my reverie
The lights that came to glow for me
Watch me dance with this memory
Just as real, just as half for me
Watch me dance in my reverie
The lights that came for my love amazing

In the mist of the crowded room, we might have float
But all I see is you, and you alone
‘Cause you're in my soul, can't let you go, fighting for you
And in my dreams I'll make you my pair
As we move close, and I grove with you
Blue and green rays they shine through
Feel the energy, you don't have to try
You can see it in our bodies, you can see it in our eyes
Watch me dance with this memory
Just as real, just as half for me
Watch me dance in my reverie
The lights that came to glow for me
Watch me dance with this memory
Just as real, just as half for me
Watch me dance in my reverie
The lights that came for my love amazing
