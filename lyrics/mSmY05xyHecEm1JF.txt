Tonight, tonight
It's a long, long night
Tonight, tonight
It's a long, long night

Can't you hear me mama call
Can't you hear me crawling
Can't you hear me mama call
Can't you hear me trying
Can't you hear me when I call
I'm a long way from sight

Tonight, tonight
It's a long, long night
Tonight, tonight
It's a long, long night

Can't you see me baby fly
Can't you see me falling
Can't you hear me when I call
Can't you see me fall

Can't you hear me mama call
Can't you hear me mama call

Tonight, tonight
It's a long, long night
Tonight, tonight
It's a long, long night

Can't you hear me mama call
Can't you hear me crawling
Can't you hear me when I call
Can't you see me fall

Can't you hear me mama call
Can't you hear me mama call
Can't you hear me mama call

Me hielo en la habitación
No tengo calefacción
Can't get no satisfaction
So me bajo pa la calle
It's a long, long night

Can't you hear me mama call (It's a long, long night)
Can't you hear me crawling (It's a long, long night)
Can't you hear me mama call (It's a long, long night)
Can't you hear me falling (It's a long, long night)
Can't you hear me mama call (It's a long, long night)
Can't you hear me crawling (It's a long, long night)
Can't you hear me mama call (It's a long, long night)
I'm a long way from home (It's a long, long night)

Can't you hear me mama call (It's a long, long night)
I'm a long way from home
I'm a long way from home
Can't you hear me mama call
Can't you hear me mama call, yes
