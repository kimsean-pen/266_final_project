Welcome to a day of my life (a day of my life)
The Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel
Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, to a day of my life
The Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel

Though the lights were low, I could see you both
In a lovers' sillouette
And my heart stood still, I was froze right there
Staring down at her red dress
So I bolted out the door, jumped right into the car
It's too dangerous to be in the vicinity of where you are
Rolled down all the windows just so I could breath
Can't believe you just actually did that S**T to me
I'm going 'bout a hundred, mascara running
Laughing out of anger, but it don't strike me as funny
Been too good to you, I've been virtuous and true
To have something like this happen in my own bedroom, I...

Betcha Gon Know how it feels
When I get you back
Betcha Gon Know how it feels
And your hearts been cracked
Betcha Gon Know how it feels
When we fade to black
How it feels
And you see your whole world collapse
I'm gonna lalalalala laugh
I'm gonna lalalalala laugh
I'm gonna lalalalala laugh
Right in your face boy

Betcha Gon Know how it feels

So I pulled to the side of the road to fix my face
But I can't cover with make up what my tears want to erase
I wake up in a haze, morning dew, and sun rays
As i drive i hide my eyes behind my black Cavalli shades
A block from the house, slowly creep in the driveway
Tiptoe through the door, but you're there wide awake
You're like: Where you been?
I'm like: Sorry but I fell asleep on Jasmin's sofa
I could have swore that RaeRae called you and told ya
You're like: You OK?
I'm like: Mmm, I'm alright. Go to sleep and I'll be fine
But if you only knew what was in the back of my mind
Already stung, but you really gonna find out in time

Betcha Gon Know how it feels
When I get you back
Betcha Gon Know how it feels
And your hearts been cracked
Betcha Gon Know how it feels
When we fade to black
How it feels
And you see your whole world collapse

This is for real, for real, for real
Oprah Winfrey, whole segment, for real, for real
20/20, Barbara Walters, for real, for real
60 minutes for real

Baby, I had all my trust in and look at what you put me through
You got me all crazy
Somewhere down the line you gon get what you deserve
You F*****G jerk
You were supposed to save me, my sweet baby
Now we are fading away

But you gon know how this feels
Even if it's the last thing I ever do
