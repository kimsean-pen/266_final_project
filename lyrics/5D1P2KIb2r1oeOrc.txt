Pressure is on
The clock's ticking
Sweating bullets
The plot thickens
Nothing but a blank stare on my face
As another hour slips away
And the fuse slowly burns
I can't come to terms
That the world won't stop for me

I try to keep up
I keep my feet to the ground
But can't make the world slow down

Too much to do
Not enough time
All the things that I can't
Just weigh on my mind
I can't control what's out of my hands
When I'm up against the grains of sand
Pendulum swings
Pendulum takes
Reaper come to whisk me away
Head first towards a brick wall
And I can't pump the brakes

I try to keep up
I keep my feet to the ground
But can't make the world slow down

Pendulum swings
Pendulum takes
Reaper come to whisk me away
