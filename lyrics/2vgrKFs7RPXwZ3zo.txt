Here we go down that same ol' road again
Sympathy unfolds the shell that holds all the beauty within
Here we go down that same ol' road again

A memory, a regret, a hope

Here we go down that same ol' road again
Empathy controls the wind that blows and tickles our skin

A memory, a regret, a hope, a stimulant

Recent it seems
We must push on, we must push on
Though we bleed
We must push on, we must push on

All you need is a modest house in a modest neighborhood
In a modest town where honest people dwell
Making the cleanest energy for the greenest plants to grow
Richest soil that is drenched with the freshest rain

Then you should sit in your backyard
Watch clouds peak over the tallest mountain tops
'Cause they unveil honest opinions about the stars

We must push on, we must push on
Recent it seems
We must push on, we must push on
Though we bleed
We must push on, we must push on

All you need is a modest house
In a modest neighborhood
All you need is a modest house
In a modest neighborhood

All you need is a modest house
In a modest neighborhood
All you need is a modest house
In a modest neighborhood
All you need is a modest house
In a modest neighborhood
