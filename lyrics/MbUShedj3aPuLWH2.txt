It's amazing how much time love saves you at first
When you rediscover your reason to work
And your aimless dreaming has found a targeting
And normalize and greed a function return
Came on early, quarter to two
I don't need more wine, I'm coming for you
We carry pictures in our pretend wallet
Have ourselves and heavily edited
... eat with better handwriting and longer days at the park
And dinners with no drama the professor and Marianne
Came home early, a quarter to two
I don't need more wine, I'm coming for you
When I was young, I didn't know if I was better off with sleep over
I've grown up, I wonder what was that world I was dreaming off
When I was young, I didn't know if I was better off with sleep over
I've grown up, I wonder what was that world I was dreaming of
What was that world I was dreaming of
What was that world I was dreaming of
... regular shirt, same ... last year, more so
When I was young, I didn't know if I was better off with sleep over
I've grown up, I wonder what was that world I was dreaming off
What was that world I was dreaming of
What was that world I was dreaming of.
