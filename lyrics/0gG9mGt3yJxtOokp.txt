We could be Future Friends
We could be Future Friends

Can't think about it too much
Is just this moment enough?
You got your version of love, this I know

I know you put in the time
I see it weigh on your mind
Someone like you is hard to find, this I know

So if it all ends, I promise that one day
We could be Future Friends
And if we let go tomorrow, just know
We could be Future Friends

We could be Future Friends

You know I can't let you go
It hurts to hold you so close
No good at being alone, let's go slow

Don't think we're wasting our time
Even if we're undefined
Either way we'll be alright, this I know

So if it all ends, I promise that one day
We could be Future Friends
And if we let go tomorrow, just know
We could be Future Friends

We could be Future Friends
We could be Future Friends
We could be Future Friends
We could be Future Friends

Let's just take this day by day, just works that way
No way, can we plan for forever?
Let's just take this day by day, just works that way
No way, can we plan for forever?

So if it all ends, I promise that one day
We could be Future Friends
And if we let go tomorrow, just know
We could be Future Friends

We could be Future Friends
We could be Future Friends
We could be Future Friends
