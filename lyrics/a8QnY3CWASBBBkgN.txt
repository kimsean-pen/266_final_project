Can you tell a wish from a spell? A hug from a lie?
They both make you feel so gone
We warned you from harm again
Your beating hearts again

We made love in June
I heard it from you
You were my best friend
You used my name

Hit hard with harm, she loves to off you then yawn
Never disarm, you know she loves to be drawn
You're leaching her friend
I'm feeling down again

We made love with a few
I took it from you
You were my worst friend
I felt that way

Braiding her hair, you can tell her from here
Drink her last tear, yeah, you die for your dear
Bad vibes around her
She's eating our hearts again

We made love in June
I heard it from you
You were my best friend
You used my name

Inside, outside
Inside, outside
Inside, outside
Inside, outside

Inside, outside
Inside, outside
Inside, outside
Inside, outside

Inside, outside
Inside, outside
Inside, outside
Inside, outside
