Things I wanna tell you
How you make me feel
How you look to me
And how good it feels
Things I don't wanna tell you
Every little thing's alright
What I was before
And where I was last night

Always things
All these things
Always things

Things I try to tell you
Come out oh, so wrong
They seem to feel pretty good
They seem to last pretty long
Things I don't wanna tell you
Now there ain't no doubt
You lit a fire in me
I can't seem to put it out

Always things
Always things

Things I long to tell you but I, I don't know how
Things I don't want to tell you, but I have to now

Packed my things

Things I'm bound to tell you
Like that dress looks great on ya
I could use some breathing room
But I'm still in love with you
Things I'd never tell you
Down the line someday
You'll be a song I sing
A thing I give away, yeah
Packed my things today
Packed my things today
