Street's like a jungle
So call the police
Following the herd
Down to Greece
On holiday
Love in the Nineties
Is paranoid
On sunny beaches
Take your chances
Looking for
Girls who are boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone, you really love

Avoiding all work
'Cos there's none available
Like battery thinkers
Count your thoughts
On one, two, three, four, five fingers
Nothing is wasted
Only reproduced
You get nasty blisters
Du bist sehr sch√∂n
But we haven't been introduced
Girls who are boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone, you really love

Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls

Always should be someone to really love
