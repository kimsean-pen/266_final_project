Jacket of skinned and shivering
Bodies lying in the pile, woah oh oh
A basket of notes organic
Lying, waiting for a smile, woah oh oh
I need you to move much quicker
Western with a second thought, woah oh oh
To flippin' undress (?) rehearsals
Lessons better left untaught, woah oh

I don't know what I'm thinking
My faith never blinking

Your friend and her tripping children
Nearby falling in the road, woah oh oh
A clip in internal meters
Stopping everything that floats, woah oh oh
I fear for the circles moving
Falling in and out, woah oh oh
I need you to get it over
I don't ever wanna shout, woah oh

I don't know what I'm thinking
Blind faith never blinking
I don't know what I'm thinking
My faith never blinking
