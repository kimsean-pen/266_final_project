Won't you be my wagon wheel
Won't you tell me, baby, how do you feel?
Yeah you got to live yeah your life as though you're number one
Yeah you got to live yeah your life
And make a point of having some fun
But if you think that you get kicks
From flirting with danger, danger ooh
Just kick her in head and rearrange her
Oh heavenly father, what can I do?
What she's done to me is making me crazy
Oh heavenly father, I know I have sinned but look where I've been
It's making me lazy
Won't you be my wagon wheel
Won't you tell me, baby, how do you feel?
You got to live yeah your life as though you're number one
Yeah you got to live yeah your life
And make a point of having some fun
But if you think that you get kicks
From flirting with danger, danger ooh
Just kick her in head and rearrange her
And then why don't you wake me, shake me
Please don't you let me sleep too long ...
