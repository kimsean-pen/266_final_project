I'm heading for the end
On top of this bullshit I don't want to hear it
I found my way again
It's hard to explain it I know that I hate it.
I don't feel this could be real
I find so hard
I'm falling apart
So much so much for what for what we said

No matter what I say
You turn your back away
It's never gonna break you
It's never gonna make you fall
No matter what I say
You turn your back away.
It's never gonna break you
It's never gonna make you fall

Fake reality
I never can make up the time that you take up
It's my worst enemy
I'm on a mission to feed my addiction
so sick of thoughts so empty.
It's well overflowed
I'm bound to explode
So much so much for what for what we said

No matter what I say
You turn your back away
It's never gonna break you
It's never gonna make you fall
No matter what I say
You turn your back away
It's never gonna break you
It's never gonna make you fall

Somehow between the lines it's clearer
Locked down and chained up to the mirror
Somehow between the lines it's clearer
Locked down it takes apart of me

I'm heading for the end
On top of this bullshit.
I don't want to hear it
I found my way again
It's hard to explain it I know that I hate it
I don't feel this could be real.
I found so hard
I'm falling apart
So much so much for what for what we said

No matter what I say
You turn your back away.
It's never gonna break you
It's never gonna make you fall
No matter what I say
You turn your back away
It's never gonna break you
It's never gonna make you fall
