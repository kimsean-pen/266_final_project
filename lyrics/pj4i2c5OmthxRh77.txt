Did you forget to call me?
Oh baby, did you lose my number?
Don't tell me that you're sorry
Whose covers are you sleeping under?

I was just across the street, and I just wanted to reach out
Thinking we could get together
And I didn't mean to stalk you, but I saw that guy you talked to
Everybody knows I'm jealous

And I know it's not all about me
I know that you don't come easily
But you reach from the stars, and it's worth it

If you're gonna act like we're just friends
Throw away the messages I sent
If you're playing a game, then it's workin'

Did you forget to call me?
Oh baby, did you lose my number?
Don't tell me that you're sorry
Whose covers are you sleeping under?

You know I just want someone that I can love
Someone that I can love, someone that I can love, can love

Did you forget to call me?
Oh baby, did you lose my number?

And I really thought you liked me
Since you did invite me
And your modern friends to hang out

Then I guess what touched the most is
I know I've just been ghosted
Who knew you could you be so calloused

Did you forget to call me?
Oh baby, did you lose my number?
Don't tell me that you're sorry
Whose covers are you sleeping under?

You know I just want someone that I can love
Someone that I can love, someone that I can love, can love
You know I just want someone that I can love
Someone that I can love, someone that I can love, can love

Did you forget to call me?
Oh baby, did you lose my number?

Did you forget to call me?
Did you forget to call me?

I was just across the street
And I just wanted to reach out
Thinking we could get together

You know I just want someone that I can love
Someone that I can love, someone that I can love, can love
You know I just want someone that I can love
Someone that I can love, someone that I can love, can love

Did you forget to call me?
