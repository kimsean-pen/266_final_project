Hey baby it's alright
You can come to my house tonight
I'll give directions here
A couple of hours and you'll be near
Take the road right out of town
Check your gas and oil is sound
Watch the road you'll be alright
And you can drive right through the night

Here comes
The road let's go
The radio
As far as we can go
Here it comes
The road let's go
The radio
As far as we can go

Take the road down to the stream
Be sure to keep your licence clean
Better slow down for the lights
There's a cop up there who sits up all night
Take the hill in second gear
You can see my house from here
And the way my heart is beating
You'll hear the sound
It'll wake the sleeping

Here comes (here comes)
The road let's go (turn on)
The radio (let's go)
As far as we can go
Here it comes (here comes)
The road let's go (turn on)
The radio (let's go)
As far as we can go

Leave the car by the broken gate
Cut the engine pull the brake
Take a stroll along the path
You'll find my key beneath the mat
Throw your bag down the bed
Pull a comb across your head
Take a line, it'll be alright
And we'll get stoned all through the night

Here comes (here comes)
The road let's go (turn on)
The radio (let's go)
As far as we can go
Here it comes (here comes)
The road let's go (turn on)
The radio (let's go)
As far as we can go
