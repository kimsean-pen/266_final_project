I can taste it in my mouth
I am hanging upside down
All the faces gathered round
To wait and see, to breath relief
To call my name for the first time

Cry your eyes out
Fill your lungs up
We all hurt
We all lie
And nothing stays the same

Oh dear life

I can face it just about
I'd rather hurt than live without
But I will rage and scream and shout
A love, a life, it's dark and bright
It's beautiful and it's alright

To cry your eyes out
Fill your lungs up
We all hurt
We all lie
And nothing stays the same

Let your guard down
Get your heart pounded
We all bleed
We all breathe
And nothing stays the same

We hold out
For some day
And nothing stays the same
We all believe in something that'll rip us into shreds
We all know why it stings to open up your chest
We all show signs of greatness that we hope that someone sees
Our broken teeth are scattered but we're smiling underneath
A thousand bruising muscles still we're running on and on

We all know names that ring like thunder rattling our walls
Everyone is yearning for a reason, for a cause
Somewhere deep inside we holding on for dear life

Oh dear life
Oh dear life
Oh dear life
Cry your eyes out
Fill your lungs up

We all hurt
We all lie
And nothing stays the same
Let your guard down
Get your heart pounded
We all breathe
We all bleed
And nothing stays the same
Yeah
We all heard
We all learned
That nothing stays the same
