I'm feeling stuck here,
Break it up, break it up.
A little low here,
Take it up, take it up.
I'm getting bored here,
Shake it up with me, now.

You think you're playing a game,
Well, it's playing you.
I think you all look the same,
But who's blaming you?
Well I know that you can't help it.

I need to,
Pull myself together,
If we're talking about forever,
Then this room just got a little bit smaller.
And it's not like I signed up for this.
I'm sorry, but I just got to be honest,
You're not my type,
No hard feelings,
Thank you and goodnight.

I'm lost for words here,
Make it up, make it up.
This is the worst can I,
Shut you up, shut you up.
I'm getting bored here, bottom's up with me now.
Your ego's salting the game,
And it's coming through.
I'm seeing you're just the same,
But who's blaming you?
Well, I know that you can't help it.

I need to,
Pull myself together,
If we're talking about forever,
Then this room just got a little bit smaller.
And it's not like I signed up for this.
I'm sorry, but I just got to be honest,
You're not my type,
No hard feelings,
Thank you and goodnight.

You can't help it,
I can't help but wonder why, wonder why.
You can't help it,
I can't help but wonder why, wonder why.

I need to,
Pull myself together,
If we're talking about forever,
Then this room just got a little bit smaller.
And it's not like I signed up for this.
I'm sorry, but I just got to be honest,
You're not my type,
No hard feelings,

Well I need to,
Pull myself together,
If we're talking about forever,

You're not my type,
No hard feelings,
Thank you and goodnight.
Thank you and goodnight.
Thank you and goodnight.
