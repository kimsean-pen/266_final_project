For every encaged hope there is a reason to struggle
And it doesn't take much courage just to say "no"
I see no justice in considering the profit over the tons of murders
A cage is a cage and the bankers won't be the ones who scream
Their conscience, our reason, you need to abandon this ship

Day by day we keep on tearing down our cages
So what is fair into collaborating to theirs?

For every encaged hope there is a reason to struggle
For every damaged heart there is a reason to fight
For every enclosed life there is a reason to struggle
And it doesn't take much courage to just say no!
