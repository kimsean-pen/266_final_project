Think about your life you wouldn't give it up
Think about your life you wouldn't give it up
Think about your life
Before you're led off to the slaughter you ought to

And just before you fade out too
I will hold a place for you

Do you remember when we used to?
Do you remember when you used to?
Do you remember life?
Well, as you're led out to the slaughter you ought to

Think about your life you wouldn't give it up
Think about your life you wouldn't give it up
Think about your life
Before you're led off to the slaughter you ought to

And just as soon as you will find
That all of this became your life

Do you remember when we used to?
Do you remember when you used to?
Do you remember life?
Well, as you're led out to the slaughter you ought to

Think about your life, you wouldn't give it up
Think about your life, you wouldn't give it up
Think about your life
Before you're led off to the slaughter you ought to
Think about your life, you wouldn't give it up
Think about your life, you wouldn't give it up
Think about your life
Before you're led off to the slaughter, you ought to

And just as soon as
All of this so, all of this so pure
No
No
No
All of this so pure

Think about your life, you wouldn't give it up
Think about your life, you wouldn't give it up
Think about your life
Before you're led off to the slaughter you ought to
Think about your life, you wouldn't give it up
Think about your life, you wouldn't give it up
Think about your life
Before you're led off to the slaughter you ought to
Think about your life, you wouldn't give it up
Think about your life, you wouldn't give it up
Think about your life
Before you're led off to the slaughter you ought to
Think about your life
Think about your life (you wouldn't give it up)
Think about your life
Do you ever stop
Think
