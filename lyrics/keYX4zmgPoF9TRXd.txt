Oh no, I don't recall
I can't remember anything at all
The life we knew is lost and gone
And it's hard without you

I know the world is new
And what you lost inside, inside of you
And all the love we shared is true
And it's hard without you

Ooooh life is gone, what I had is gone
But it's hard to go
Ooooh without you

Oh no, I don't recall
I can't remember anything at all
And what we knew, that life is gone and it's hard without you

Ooooh my world is gone, what I had is gone
But it's hard to go
Ooooh without you

Ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooh

Life we shared is gone and it's hard without you
