Oh, no not now,
please not now
I've just settled into the glass half empty made myself at home
And so why now?
Oh, please not now
I just stopped believing in happy endings, harbors of my own

But you had to come along didn't you
Break down the doors,
throw open windows
Oh, if you knew just what a fool you have made me
So what do I do with this?

This stray Italian greyhound,
these inconvenient fireworks
This ice-cream, covered screaming hyperactive thought
God, I just want to lay down,
these colors make my eyes hurt
This feeling calls for everything that I am not

I'm not that kind,
I'm so good at shooting down any notion
This tired world could change
It's all been bought,
well at least that was my line
No use in spending all that emotion when there's someone else to blame

But you had to come along didn't you?
Rev up the crowd,
rewrite the rule book
Where do I go when every no turns into maybe
So what do I do with this?

This sudden burst of sunlight
and me with my umbrella
Cross-indexing every weatherman's report
I was ready for the down slide
but not for spring to well up
This feeling calls for everything I can't afford
to know
is possible now

What do I do, do I do with a love that won't sit still?
Won't do what it's told
What do I do, do I do with a love that won't sit still?

Please not now,
Please not now,
Please not now,
Please not

What do I do, do I do with a love that won't sit still?
With a love that won't sit still
What do I do, do I do with a love that won't
With a love that won't sit still?

What do I do, do I do with a love that won't, that won't sit still?
Won't do what it's told
What do I do, do I do with a love that won't sit still?

Everything that I am, everything that I am
Everything that I am, everything that I am
