Well I guess what hurt me most of all
You were playing with my heart
Tell me why am I emotional
When I knew it from the start

And tell me why does my heartburn
When I see your face?
You have made your decision
Put me in my place
And the lies you've been hiding
Taking up your space
Tell me why does my heart burn this way
When I see your face, when I see your face

All this time you left me wanting more
Had me swallowing all of my pride

Wonder where this part of you came from
It was hidden in the shallow of your eyes

And tell me why does my heartburn
When I see your face?
You have made your decision
Put me in my place
And the lies you've been hiding
Taking up your space
Tell me why does my heartburn this way
When I see your face, when I see your face

Lover why you been hiding
From the places we've been
From the places we've been
Lover why you been hiding
From the places we've been
From the places we've been
Lover why you been hiding
From the places we've been
From the places we've been
Lover why you been hiding
From the places we've been
From the places we've been

And tell me why does my heartburn
When I see your face?
You have made your decision
Put me in my place
And the lies you've been hiding
Taking up your space
Tell me why does my heartburn this way
When I see your face...
