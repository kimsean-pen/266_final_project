There is always something nagging
pulling at the edges
tearing what's left away
there is always something waiting
in the flowered circle
disguised by pleasantries
and all i want is a garden
come to call me
there's always something convincing
you that you need it
even when you don't care vaguely
and all i want is a garden
come to call me
and all i want is a garden
come to call me

War is in the? I said war is tonight
war is in the? I said war is tonight
war is in the? I said war is
a lot of people don't get no supper tonight
war is in the? I said war is
you got to call the police for me
it's a state of emergency
as far as my eyes can see
there are other vigilantes
war is in the? I said war is tonight
war is in the? I said war is
a lot of people don't get no supper tonight
war is in the? I said war is
