Somehow I know
That things are gonna change
New boundaries on the way
Like never were before
Find a meaning to your life
Healing whispers of the angels
Bring the sunrise again

New day shines, fallen angels will arise
Nova Era brings the ashes back to life
All over now, all the pain and awful lies
Angels will arise
Back to life!

Fresh winds of hope
Has taken us ahead
Forever is a place
You have to keep in mind
No way to limit our goals
We'll find a reason to believe
Facing Nova Era

New day shines, fallen angels will arise
Nova Era brings the ashes back to life
All over now, all the pain and awful lies
Angels will arise
Back to life!

Oh! Come on! Arise!

Find a meaning to your life
No way to limit our goals
Healing whispers of the angels
Bring the sunrise again!

New day shines, fallen angels will arise
Nova Era brings the ashes back to life
All over now, sores of pain and awful lies
Angels lead you through paradise
Nova Era is the passage to your mind
And forever you may find a better time
Nova Era bring the angels back to life
Life!
