Like a foreign tongue, I can't speak
I fell down for you
For you I've played the clown
Stayed around, did what I had to
For too, for too long
Without my spine, I can't sleep or stand with you
For you I sold this home, for dust and stone
I did what I had to
For you, for you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
I've played the clown for you, so lay me down with you
I've played the clown for you, so lay me down with you
I've played the clown for you, so lay me down with you
I've played the clown for you, so lay me down with you
No license to play, you'll act the fool
These tricks are getting old
We take this road by being cruel
This still remains unsolved
I'm lost so far from home, we are
adrift at sea, more like to see
A perfect scene, a bottle green, a broken chance seam to seam
(so lay me down with you) ooh
(so lay me down with you) ooh
(so lay me down with you, with you, with you, with you)
Ooh ooh ooh oooh
(so lay me down with you)
(so lay me down with you)
I've played the clown for you, so lay me down with you
I've played the clown for you, so lay me down with you
I've played the clown for you, so lay me down with you
I've played the clown for you, so lay me down with you
