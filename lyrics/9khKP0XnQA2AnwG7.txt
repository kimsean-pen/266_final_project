This coincidence is all that I can take
I just really want to impress you
Yeah I just wanna impress you, baby

Took my time and tried to make sense of it all
I never said it right
'Cause baby I just wanna impress you
I just wanna impress you, yeah

Hear it in the words that you say all the time
Even if I don't want to play it over in my mind

Just say you love, say you love
Say you love, say you love
Just say you love me
Just say you love, say you love
Say you love, say you love
Just say you love me
Say you love me

This coincidence is all that I can take
I just really want to impress you
Yeah I just wanna impress you, oh

But there's nothing left to say, you've said it all
You're so young and fine
Baby, I just want to impress you
I just want to impress you, yeah

Do you long for love that was left far behind?
Honey tears are falling, you do it to me every time

Just say you love, say you love
Say you love, say you love
Just say you love me, yeah
Just say you love, say you love
Say you love, say you love
Just say you love me
Say you love me

Hear it in the words that you say all the time
Even if I don't want to play it over in my mind
Hear it in the words that you say all the time
Even if I don't want to play it over in my mind

Just say you love, say you love
Say you love, say you love
Just say you love me, yeah
Just say you love, say you love
Say you love, say you love
Just say you love me
