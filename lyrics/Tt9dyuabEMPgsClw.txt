Let's take our time
While it's still ours to take
'Cause some things hardly change
But nothing ever stays the same
Let's fall back in love
With the world and who we are
And do the things we talked about
But never did before

And darling
Don't blink because you will
And when you open up your eyes again
You may not recognize a friend

It may be bittersweet
'Cause we're no longer
Seventeen, but we're still young
So dance with me in naivety
And follow endlessly
The sound of reverie

While they're still ours to make
The past is in the rear view
And the future holds no weight
We've got a lot
But what do we got to lose?
'Cause I'm losing track of time
And I'll be all these shades of blue

So forget the hearts and all the flowers
And we could save these times that I've been working on
Focus on the trip we're on

It may be bittersweet
'Cause we're no longer
Seventeen, but we're still young
So dance with me in naivety
And follow endlessly
The sound of reverie
Of reverie
Of reverie

I was bittersweet
But, baby, did I
And if you blink
If you move another
(It's tough to be anything these days
They tell me how much of right now is ours to take
Some say the passing of time is bittersweet
But I think I love time the most when I'm with you
The truth doesn't mean a thing)

Don't blink because you will
And when you open up your eyes again
(Your eyes again)
And darling don't blink because you will
And when you open up your eyes again
You may not recognize a friend

It may be bittersweet
'Cause we're no longer
Seventeen, but we're still young
So dance with me in naivety
And follow endlessly
In reverie

(Don't blink because you will
And when you open up your eyes again)
We're still young
So dance with me in naivety
And follow endlessly
The sound of reverie
Of reverie
Of reverie
The sound of
(One more time)
