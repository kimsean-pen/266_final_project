Beseech in boundless greed
From barren womb
You wrenched my seed

I shall never see
My children smile
You've blinded me

I shall never see
The truth you conceal
I shall never see

I shall never see
Your altar of deceit
I shall never see

Entwine, self-contrived sun
You drain my blood
This life long gone

I shall never see
The truth you conceal
I shall never see

I shall never see
Your altar of deceit
I shall never see

I shall never see
The truth you conceal
I shall never see

I shall never see
Your altar of deceit
I shall never see
