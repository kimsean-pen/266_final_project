You're coming slow
I hear you're so bad
I'm gonna love your fame I'll love you slow
You're feeling so fast
You're gonna love this pace
Wanted a sight Come into focus
Don't wanna lose your face
I hold your mouth I'm feeling invaded Feeding from your blood
Ooh, I feel your body falling
Ooh, might hold on when it's raining Feel your weight
I'm breaking the waves Ooh, ha ha
Like a prayer
We're breaking the waves My body
loves Feeling invaded By your gentle grace
You feel the stain
We both can't be safe as
I wanna love your face
Ooh, I feel your body falling
Ooh, might hold on when it's
raining Feel your weight (feel your weight)
Ooh, I feel your body falling Huh, huh,
wait Ooh, might hold on when it's raining
Feel your weight, feel your
Don't worry, baby Surrender to your knees
Don't worry, baby Surrender to your
Don't worry, baby Surrender to your knees
Don't worry, baby Surrender to your knees
I feel your weight
I feel your weight
I feel your weight
