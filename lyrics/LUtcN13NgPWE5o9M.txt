Hey

D.D.T. did a job on me
Now I am a real sickie
Guess I'll have to break the news again
That I got no mind to lose
All the girls are in love with me
I'm a teenage lobotomy, yeah

Slugs and snails are after me
D.D.T. keeps me happy
Now I guess I'll have to tell 'em
That I got no cerebellum
Gonna get my Ph.D.
I'm a teenage lobotomy, yeah
