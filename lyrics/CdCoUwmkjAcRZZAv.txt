When I'm uncertain, you run away
Heart's taking over me
Why are you scared?
It's just an emotion
It's not really there
Don't hold it over me
I see your stare

I may have seen and said too much
Just trying hard getting touch
I'm gone now,
I'm here for you
We're playing games and fighting trust
I didn't mean to come undone
I'm gone now,
I'm here for you

And I won't stop giving too much
It's not enough, it's not enough
No, I don't stop giving you now
It's not enough, it's not enough

no, I won't stop

It's been hold to sleep right, lying in your sway
I tried to hold you tight
There's nothing left
When I bring the storm in do you feel at risk?
In our every morning I can only guess

I may have seen and said too much
Just trying hard getting touch
I'm gone now,
I'm here for you
We're playing games and fighting trust
I didn't mean to come undone
I'm gone now,
I'm here for you

And I won't stop giving too much
It's not enough, it's not enough
No, I don't stop giving you now
It's not enough, it's not enough

no, I won't stop

I can always feel the way you move, moving onto me
I'm a bird that's losing altitude
Darling, go to sea
I can try to fly away from you when you comfort me
I'm a bird that's losing altitude
Darling, go to sea
