Come over here, beautiful reaction
Come over here, beautiful distraction
I never wanted anything more than I want you
I never wanted anything more than I want you

You got me overthinking
New York City drinking
Never wanted nothing like I want you
My mind is breaking
What if I just say it
Never wanted more than I want
Nothing, nothing more than you

Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night
There's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

Come over here, I never had a choice in us
So whatcha fear? Cause there's a little poison in all of us
Never wanted anything more than I want you
Never wanted anything more than I want you

You got me overthinking
New York City drinking
Never wanted nothing like I want you
My mind is breaking
What if I just say it
Never wanted more than I want
Nothing, nothing more than you

More than you
Nothing, nothing more than you
More than you
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night
No, there's nothing, nothing, nothing
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night
No, there's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

You got me overthinking
New York City drinking
Never wanted nothing like I want you
My mind is breaking
What if I just say it
Never wanted more than I want
Nothing, nothing more than you

Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night, no
There's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night, no
There's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough hours in the night, no
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
