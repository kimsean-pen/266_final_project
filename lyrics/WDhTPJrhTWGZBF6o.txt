Last thing I saw this winding road
Goes through valley ahead
This day what fear
I'm already dead, I'm already dead

What shock to find I'm free, yeah, I'm free
Cut loose binds I invented for me

This now I claim in love insane
Kicked down thank you
Would have been so lost
Without doubt your pain

What shock to find I'm free, yeah, I'm free
Cut loose binds I invented for me

Your lies are too much for you, he says
Twisting tree this wind world eyes blinded

Last thing I saw this winding road
Goes through valley ahead
This day what fear
I'm already dead, I'm already sad

What shock to find I'm free, yeah, I'm free
Cut loose binds I invented for me
