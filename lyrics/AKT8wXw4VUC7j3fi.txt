Once again, I'm falling to my knees
I try to escape cause I just can't take it
And now, this feeling is spreading like a disease
I think I'm in a dream, but the wheel keeps turning

This place is so pathetic
Doesn't anybody get it
Is there anybody home?
Is there anybody home?

There's nothing left
We're just a shadow
Of what we used to be

In the night
There's a fire in my eyes
And this paradise
Has become a place we've come to cry
When I open your letter
The words make it better
It takes it all away

(ooh)
It keeps me holding on
(ooh)
It keeps me holding on

Here we are, pretending we're okay
You can say what you want, but you still can't fool me
The lives we're living, it's all a masquerade
I try to smile, but I can't remember how

So how'd we get so jaded
Is it so complicated
To not give up on me?

In the night
There's a fire in my eyes
And this paradise
Has become a place we've come to cry
When I open your letter
The words make it better
It takes it all away
(Oh, ooh)
It keeps me holding on
Whenever I need you
Wherever I run to
I'll know where to find you

It keeps me holding on.
Whenever I need you
Wherever I run to
I know where to find you

Ooh ooh
You keep me holding on
You keep me holding on

In the night
There's a fire in my eyes
(There's a fire in my eyes)
And this paradise
Has become a place we've come to cry
(Has become a place we've come to cry)
When I open your letter
The words make it better
It takes it all away
(Takes it all away)

(Oh, oooh)
It keeps me holding on
(Whenever I need you
Wherever I run to
I'll know where to find you)
It keeps me holding on
(Whenever I need you
Wherever I run to
I'll know where to find you)
It keeps me holding on
