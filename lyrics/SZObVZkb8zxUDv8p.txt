Imagine this we make things right
So beautiful we cling tonight
To all our dreams
We pin them up
We'll lose our minds if we lose our hope
We swear to change but we bottle it
Stick to our guns and all our sins
We bury fear
We drink to it
We might cheat death if we worship it

So we can stay alive
Our sex our power our drive
We lose ourselves inside
So we can feel alive

You're the one who should be on trial
For all your hate and your denial
Be careful what it is you break
Every broken thing can't be fixed
And all these fragile things we are
They find their voice they find their power
They take a grip around your throat
They keep squeezing til your life runs out

So we can stay alive
Our sex our power our drive
We lose ourselves inside
So we can feel alive

Masochistic Victim Sadist
Victor Vanquished Valour Sadness
Lust and love our lies our blindness

All alone we fight the fear
By ourselves in every way
All our lust all our greed all our hate
We're on our knees
Hear us beg
Hear us pray
We can stay alive
