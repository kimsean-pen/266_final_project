Standing here in an empty room
I saw you there and my blood ran cold
Take me back to that long September
Don't know how I ever let you go

I was young, didn't know about love
You were wild, couldn't get enough
Gave my heart to another lover
Don't know how I ever let you go

Find me another place in time
If only, if only you were mine
But I'm already someone else's baby

Guess I had my last chance
And now this is our last dance
You fell through the cracks in my hands
Hard to say it's over
But I'm already someone else's...

Baby, ahh
Baby, ahh
Baby, ahh
I'm already someone else's

All caught up in the way we were
I feel your hands getting close to mine
Don't say the words that I love to hear
The beat goes on and I close my eyes

I was young, didn't know about love
You were wild, couldn't get enough
Let's leave things the way they were
You stay with me like a lullaby

Find me another place in time
If only, if only you were mine
But I'm already someone else's baby

Guess I had my last chance
And now this is our last dance
You fell through the cracks in my hands
Tell myself be stronger
My heart's like a rubber band

And it's such a shame
You'll always be the one who got away
We both know that deep down you feel the same
Hard to say it's over
But I'm already someone else's...

Baby, ahh
Baby, ahh
Baby, ahh
I'm already someone else's

Wish I had met you at another place in time
If only, if only you were mine
This love story ends for you and I
'Cause I'm already someone else's...

Baby, ahh
Baby, ahh
Baby, ahh
I'm already someone else's...

Baby, ahh
Baby, ahh
Baby, ahh
I'm already someone else's
