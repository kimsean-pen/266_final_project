All she wants is
All she wants is
All she wants is

All she wants is
All she wants is
All she wants is

Hey, spend your money on the corner, now
You know you've gotta save some for the shoeshine, boy
You've been pulling them by the hand inside
Oh, collecting all your toys

If you need a lead to heaven now
Just stick around, you're gonna be there
What do you care? What do you dare?
What does your heart say, now?

All she wants is
All she wants is
All she wants is

Divine intervention, couldn't keep
The word from leaking out
With your pleasure in suspension
Not to mention what you hang it around

If you need a lead to heaven, yeah
A place to share in every position
What do you care? What do you dare?
What does your heart say, now?

All she wants is
All she wants is
All she wants is
More, more, more, guess what?
Yeah, guess what?

All she wants is
All she wants is
All she wants is
All she wants is

All she wants is
All she wants is
All she wants is
All she wants is

All she wants is
All she wants is
All she wants is
All she wants is
