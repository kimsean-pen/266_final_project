I'm not all here and that's a hard place to be
When your arms, they won't let go of me
So I hold you back, it's all I know how to do
When your love falls down with you

I picked it up and made it look just like new
And we made it last like long we do
'Til it ran out and we were left without
Someone to run to

Oh, I'm willing to try but finding that I'm not playing
The games you're saying we should play
And now it's clear that we're still hoping these doors will open
To our love, our time, our space
To our love, our time, our space

When I'm away chasing down restless nights
Savin' up my love to keep for us
But it slips through never to be held again
Empty hands can't be for you

Oh, I'm willing to try but finding that I'm not playing
The games you're saying we should play
And now it's clear that we're still hoping these doors will open
To our love, our time, our space
To our love, our time, our space

Will come when it does, calling for us
Oh, are you ready to see?

I'm waiting to try but finding that I'm not playin'
The games you're saying we should play
And now it's clear that we're still hoping these doors will open
To our love, our time, our space
To our love, our time, our space

To our love
To our love, our time, our space
