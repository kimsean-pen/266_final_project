We have come to hear him sing
To see this gift your savior brings

A crowd has grown, and all mesmerized
But silence quickly falls as Lord Nafaryus arrives

Nafaryus: Please don't stop on my account
Show us what we heard so much about?
In peace, we gather here today.

Daryus: Don't make him ask again
Do as my father says!

Gabriel: Brother, worry not, today
I will share my music, and they will soon be on their way
They only know the noise machines
So I'll treat them all to sonic ecstasy

Never in my dreams could I deserve
To ever see a vision quite like her
Then unexpectedly
I'm taken by surprise
An angel just appeared before my (eyes)
Fades into "When Your Time Has Come"
