Who? (If you're not the one for me, who is?)
Who?

Softly (If you're not the one for me)
Dream about the days
Love me
Tell me that you'll stay

(I need you)
If you're not the one for me, who is?
(I need you)
If you're not the one for me, who is?
(Jesus, show yourself)

Who? (If you're not the one for me, who is?)
Who?

You've made me (If you're not the one for me, who is?)
Don't leave me
In a sense
It's feelin' like the end of innocence
It's feelin' like the end

(I need you)
If you're not the one for me, who is?
(I need you)
If you're not the one for me, who is?
(Jesus, show yourself)

Who?
Who?

If you're not the one for me, who is?
(If you're not the one for me, who is?)
(Jesus, show yourself)
