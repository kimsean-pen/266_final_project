Alone at last we can sin and fight.
I've lost all faith in this bluring light,
Stay right here we can change our plight.
Storming through this despite
What's right.

One final fight
For this tonight
Whoa-oh-oh
With knives and pens
We made our plight.
Whoa-oh-oh

Lay your heart down
The end's in sight.
Conscience begs for you to do what's right.
Everyday it's still the same dull knife
Stab right through and justify
Your pride.

One final fight
For this tonight.
Whoa-oh-oh
With knives and pens
We made our plight.
Whoa-oh-oh

Well I can't go on
Without your love, you lost, you never held on.
We tried our best
Turn out the light
Turn out the light!

One final fight
For this tonight.
Whoa-oh-oh
With knives and pens
We made our plight.
Whoa-oh-oh

Well I can't go on
Without your love, you lost, you never held on.
We tried our best
Turn out the light
Turn out the light!
