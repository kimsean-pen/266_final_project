I'm high above the world
Why should I feel pain
Or feel at all
To be protected like a simple boy
If I choose to let you down
Begin to know

Your free to go
Your free to go

I will fight 'til there's nothing left
Cross the world together from this sinking ship
Or drown alone here
On the coast
Facing nothingness
Drawn to feel the emptiness
Oh help me now
Describe the scene

You're free to go
(I can't face this face for another day, there's not one thing here I'd wanna change)
You're free to go
(I can't fake this face for another day, there's not one thing here I'd wanna change)
You're free to go
You're free to go

Simple boy, stay here
Simple boy, don't wander
Simple boy, you're safe here
Simple boy, simple boy

When did we lose the plot
We're running against the clock
Don't hesitate
Or you will never know

You're free to go, Simple boy
(I can't face this face for another day, there's not one thing here I'd wanna change)
You're free to go, Don't wander
(I can't fake this face for another day, there's not one thing here I'd wanna change)
You're free to go, Simply boy
(I can't face this face for another day, there's not one thing here I'd wanna change)
You're free to go, You're safe here
(I can't fake this face for another day, there's not one thing here I'd wanna change)
You're free to go
