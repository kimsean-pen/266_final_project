The moon is like a boat, my love
Of lemon peel afloat, my love
And with a sail of gauze, my love
She seems to slightly pause
Upon her silent way, all on her silent way.

I see her pearly decks, my love
Set in with twinkling specks, my love
I see her pearly mast, my love
Far from her seashell past
And gently does she sway, all on her starry way.

Of silk they have been spun, my love
Her ropes that limply run, my love
Down to her carved prow, my love
Down to her mermaid prow
And softly does she sway, all on her starry way.

All in the Sea of Sky, my love
The moonships sail and fly, my love
Though many are their kind, my love
Though all need but one wind
To make their starry way, to make their starry way.

And there will come a time, my love
O may it be in mine, my love
When men will proudly rise, my love
And board to sail the skies
Moonships from all the spheres, moonships from all the spheres.

The men he bathed in light, my love
The women clothed in white, my love
All in that woundrous fleet, my love
As each the other meets
Will smile and softly sing, will smile and softly sing.

And on some distant sand, my love
The ships will gently land, my love
Fair folk will meet them there, my love
With golden flowing hair
And great will be their joy, and great will be their joy.

The moon is like a boat, my love
Of lemon peel afloat, my love
And with a sail of gauze, my love
She seems to slightly pause.
