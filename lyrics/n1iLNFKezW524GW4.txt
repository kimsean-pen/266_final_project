life in the gladhouse is never dull
humdrum days still flying out the window
it's wrought (wild) with overgrown people

broken engagements and twisted faith
growing up and then just growing older
oh me, oh my

an Easter parade for the innocent
a fugitive's? to pray for awhile
oh me, oh my
oh me, oh my

my shadow weaves me?
but sometimes leaves love?

oh me, oh my
oh me, oh my
?
?
oh me, oh my
oh me, oh my

so let's all dance in time
so let's all dance in time
(life in the gladhouse is never dull)
so let's all dance in time
(life in the gladhouse is never dull)
so let's all dance in time
(life in the gladhouse is never dull)
so let's all dance in time
(life in the gladhouse is never dull)
