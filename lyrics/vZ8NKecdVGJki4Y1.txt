Who's gonna tell you when it's too late
Who's gonna tell you things aren't so great

You can't go on thinking nothing's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Who's gonna pick you up when you fall
Who's gonna hang it up when you call

You can't go on thinking nothing's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Who's gonna hold you down when you shake
Who's gonna come around when you break

You can't go on thinking nothing's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

You know you can't go on thinking nothing's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home tonight
