Like a jester at the ball
Rub my shoulders with the kings
I was draped in gold and velvet
Breathing in applause
While I was jumping through the rings

And then the cooks would sound a bell
And all the kings would lick their lips
But I couldn't find a placemat
The dinner table's full
And there's no room for me to sit

Is there anybody out there
Looking out for me?
Just say you want me
Just say you need me
Is there anybody out there
Looking out for me?
Does anybody need me?
Is every last soul just fucking me over?
With tears on their shoes
And ice on their shoulders
Is there anybody out there
Looking out for me?

Lord, I live to entertain
All my pride is in my praise
I hum along with this vibration
And hope to God I make it

If any chord that I could strum
Make me feel less like a man
I'd slam my fingers in the doorway
And shatter all the bones
So I could never strum again

Is there anybody out there
Looking out for me?
Just say you want me
Just say you need me
Is there anybody out there
Looking out for me?
For me?

Is every last soul just fucking me over?
With tears on their shoes
And ice on their shoulders
Is there anybody out there
Looking out for me?

Woah, Is there anybody out
There looking out for me?
Just say you want me
Just say you need me
Is there anybody out there
Looking out for me?
For me?
Woah, Is every last soul
Just fucking me over?
With tears on their shoes
And ice on their shoulders
Is there anybody out there
Looking out for me?
For me

Is every last soul just fucking me over?
With tears on their shoes
And ice on their shoulders
Is there anybody out there
Looking out for me?
