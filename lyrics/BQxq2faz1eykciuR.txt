Here I am
In a place that I have never been
Out of love
And afraid that you won't let me in, no
You can't tell me and I started to feel
That my senses have left me to die
Where is my strength when I need it the most
Tell me what have you done with my mind

Oh, save me now
From the depth of my infatuation
I could drown in this sea of love and isolation
I'll take you down if you just save me now

All the time that I gave away
I gave to you (Oh)
And all the love that I never made
I'll make to you (Yeah)
Nothing will be more electric to me
Then to give you a taste of the love that I hide
In my condition I'm totally lost
Tell me what have you done with my pride

Oh, save me now
From the depth of my infatuation
I could drown in this sea of love and isolation
I'll take you down if you just save me now (no way)

Can't stop fantasizing with you in (I could drown)
My mind loves you, girl, loves you, all the time

Where is my strength when I need it the most
Tell me what have you done with my mind

Oh, save me now
From the depth of my infatuation
I could drown in this sea of love and isolation
Won't you save me now?
I could drown, baby
In this sea of love and isolation
I'll take you down
If you just save me now
Save me now
Save me now
