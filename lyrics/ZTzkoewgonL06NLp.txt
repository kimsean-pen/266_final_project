There she goes, looking like a star
With her body shaped like a rock guitar
There she goes
Like a shooting star
Make you wanna play
Makes all the boys them say

Yeah, the way her body moving like a hurricane
Thought I knew what sexy was, but uh, uh, that just changed
She's a pop star, rock star (La la hehehey)
Fighter, lover
She knows exactly what she's doing, I think she's a pro
When she's walking to the room, she make sure that she know
She's a thriller, killer (La la hehehey)
Dancefloor filler (La la hehehey)

There she goes, looking like a star
With her body shaped like a rock guitar
There she goes
Like a shooting star
Make you wanna play
Makes all the boys them say

She'd like to chew you up and then she'll spit you out
She's a pop star, rock star
Fighter, lover (La la hehehey)
Oh no, don't think that girl a lighter, she don't give a what (what)
Yeah, she likes to play with fire and she burns it up
She's a thriller, killer (La la hehehey)
Dancefloor filler (La la hehehey)

There she goes, looking like a star
With her body shaped like a rock guitar
There she goes
Like a shooting star
Make you wanna play
Makes all the boys them say
