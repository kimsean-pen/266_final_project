So easy to forget
Remove from consciousness
All instances
That used to be significant
I never thought those things
Would have such meaning
Until he asked me to
Give them back

What will survive of me
A cardboard box with thoughts inside
What will survive of me
My little escapes from real life
What will survive
And what will I take
To the land of endless ones

If I sever the past
It will be so dark here

We want to be loved
Loved for what we are
We want to be saved
But our final truth depends on time

So what will survive of me
A cardboard box with thoughts inside
What will survive of me
My little escapes from real life
What will survive
And what will I take
To the land of the endless ones

If I sever the past
It will be so dark here

When I met The Ferryman
He smiled to me
Could swear I saw this smile before
"You have to choose" - he said
"And then you may return
You'll get another chance to revive
If you decide to keep
Your memories from the past
By all else, you must be forgotten
If you let me take your mind
If you let me take your soul
In their hearts you'll stay forever
Your choice

The time is now
At the crossroads of your afterlife
The part of you must be lost
Make up your mind
Choose the side
Pick the card
Throw the coin from your mouth
Cause the time is now
I'm calling you again
Let's see what color
Your rising sun will have this time"
