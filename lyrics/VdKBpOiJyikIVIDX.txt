The best things in life are free
But you can keep them for the birds and bees

I need money (That's what I want)
That's what I want (That's what I want)
That's what I want (That's what I want)
That's what I want (That's what I want)

Your lovi give me such a thrill
But your lovi don't pay my bills

I need money (That's what I want)
That's what I want (That's what I want)
That's what I want (That's what I want)
That's what I want (That's what I want)

Money don't get everything, it's true
What it don't get I can't use

I need money
That's what I want (That's what I want)
That's what I want (That's what I want)
That's what I want (That's what I want)

Money (That's what I want)
Lots of money (That's what I want)
Whole lot of money (That's what I want)
Uh huh (That's what I want)
All I want (That's what I want)
Woah yeah (That's what I want)
Give me money (That's what I want)
Oh, lots of money (That's what I want)
All those lean greens, yeah (That's what I want)
I got that, uh, that's what I mean (That's what I want)
All that I want (That's what I want)
Woah Yeah (That's what I want)

Give me money
