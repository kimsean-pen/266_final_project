Today I missed my workout
But it worked out
Now I'm missing work now
But it worked out
Had to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house
Had my first kid, I love how she turned out
I love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out
I'ma have so many seeds
I could have a birdhouse
Send my love on they mama
I hope it work out
I hope it work out

Luckily, my ex uh-guh-ly
I don't eat, so she can't get no lunch with me
I don't reach, so she can't get in touch with me
Can't be buds with me
Don't know what to be
She gon' cuss at me
Told her give it a rest, so I keep custody
Keep it all side-eyes and side-hugs with me
I know that my girl's trust is a luxury
I don't want my next album sounding all Usher-y
But I must confess, I must confess
For every single ex, I want the best
I really wish you nothing but success
I know it's gonna work out

Doesn't it get dark, right before the sun peaks
And bears his face, and doesn't it get so hard to breathe
But it's gonna work out,
It's gonna work out
With nothing left to give
With nothing left to say
For no one says they're wrong
Or sets the record straight

But it's gonna work out,
It's gonna work out
It's gonna work out
That shit might hurt now, but I'm with her now
Don't need closure now, just keep the shirt now
Sorry you were led to believe (whew)
Bunch of different stories that was never to be
No you isn't ugly I just said it to be
Funny we both know that you look better than me
Sorry I started runnin' when you ran into me
I'm just tryna be the kinda man I'ma be
And I'm getting better gotta hand it to me
Seem to always workout when you hand it to Jesus

Today I missed my workout,
But it worked out
Now I'm missing work now,
But it worked out
Had to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house
Had my first kid, I love how she turned out
I love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out
I'ma have so many seeds
I could have a birdhouse
Send my love on they mama
I hope it work out
I hope it work out

I believe in long distance love, God that's above
Bond that's so strong can't let y'all bald headedâ€”
Y'all interrupt, you all in a rush
We all gon' meet up in the up, in the upper room
If I run into em', I'll be ru-running to em'
We could re-run the show, we can re-bump into 'em
If we read the wrong one, we could re-jump the broom
If we read the wrong one, baby we jump the broom
I'm ready to be groomed
I'm ready to assume, the position is filled
I was read' since the womb
I was not made for this, this was made for me
And it's gonna work out

Today I missed my workout

Now I'm missing work now

I hope it work out
I hope it work out
