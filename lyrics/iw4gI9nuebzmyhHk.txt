Shame on United Nations
For their half-heart investigations
We got a feeling we can't show
And it's only gonna grow

You can bring peace to the Earth and the skies
You can live, love, hate and start to die

But you can't stop the rock
No, you can't stop the rock
Church and State may chase you to the grave
J.D. Coeff may take you as a slave

Share your imagination
And your deep, dark inspiration
Wrap the whole thing up in wonder
And it's much too close to murder

You can shoot holes in the jumble of rum
You can go broke on a new credit card

But you can't stop the rock
No, you can't stop the rock

And I'm falling, and I'm happy
And I'm falling, and I'm happy
And I'm falling
And I'm happy

Stumbling through the dark
I've been stumbling through your heart
It's a game of sixteen paths
I've been stumbling through the dark

Can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, can't stop
Stop
