She has no problem with secrets
She knows how to keep them
She never felt the need to let them show
And I've had no trouble with speaking
Or trusting my instincts
Then maybe this is one that I should know
But as I'm waiting there
The devil on my shoulder stares
Laughing that the one thing I can't get
Is what I need

She, she is the words that I can't find
How can the only thing that's killing me make me feel so alive?
And I couldn't speak
I couldn't breathe to save my life
Although my chances swim like sinking ships
This time it's it
I'll drown or make her mine

My vocal chords, they've been fighting
My mouth likes to spite me
It never says the words that come to mind
And I brought a stick to a gun fight
And I'm stuck with my tongue tied
I run, but I can't hide what's always there

And she, she is the words that I can't find
How can the only thing that's killing me make me feel so alive?
And I couldn't speak
I couldn't breathe to save my life
Although my chances swim like sinking ships
This time it's it
I'll drown or make her mine

I can see these things I'd do
But never seem to follow through
She, She is the words that I can't find
How can the only thing that's killing me
make me feel so alive

She, she is the words that I can't find
How can the only thing that's killing me make me feel so alive?
And I couldn't speak
I couldn't breathe to save my life
Although my chances swim like sinking ships
This time it's it
I'll drown or make her mine
