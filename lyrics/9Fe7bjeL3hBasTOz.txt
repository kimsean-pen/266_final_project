Kill me, destroy my desires
Erase my ideals
Show me something better
Only then will I follow you

Divine map of virtue
You think you've got all the answers
Held to a holy standard
A pedestal to keep you safe
Eyes up to paradise
Inflicting damage through your life
I'll never live my life for the divine
I'll keep integrity and my mind

You can't kill me
You can't destroy my desires
You can't erase my ideals
You'll never show me better

I'd take my life before i'd ever follow you
Kill me, then i'll be born anew
