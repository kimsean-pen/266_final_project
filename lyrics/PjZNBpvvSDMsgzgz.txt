Uhhh
As I was walkin' by, saw you standin' there with a smile
Lookin' shy you caught my eye thought you'd want to hang for a while
Well, I'd like to be with you
And you know it's Friday too
I hope you can find the time this weekend to relax and unwind

My mind's tired, I've worked so hard all week
Ooh ooh all week
Cashed my check, I'm ready to go
I promise you, I'll show you such a good time

Come on baby, let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me, we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade
Let's go

Escapade, we'll have a good time
Escapade, leave your worries behind
Escapade, well you could be mine
Escapade, an escapade

So don't hold back just have a good time
Yea-ea-eah
We'll make the rules up as we go along
And break them all if we're not havin' fun

Come on baby, let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me, we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade

Come on baby, let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me, we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade
Let's go!

Minneapolis!

Escapade, we'll have a good time
Escapade, leave your worries behind
Escapade, well you could be mine
Escapade, an escapade

My mind's tired, I've worked so hard all
Worked so hard all week
I just got paid, we've got it made ready to go
I promise you, I'll show you such a good time

Come on baby, let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me, we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade

Come on baby, let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me, we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade
Let's go!
Come on baby, let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me, we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade
On an escapade baby
