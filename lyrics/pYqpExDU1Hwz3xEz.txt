She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie screen
I said don't mind, but what do you
Mean I am the one

Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance
On the floor in the round

She said her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
And then every head turned with eyes that
Dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls hearts
Mother always told me be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do before the lie
Becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and her plans

'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
And remember to always think twice
(Do think twice)

She told my baby that we danced till three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried
His eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
Then she came and stood right by me
The smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
But she called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
So take my strong advice
And remember to always think twice
(Do think twice)
