Long conversations
Add up to that
Maybe dive in
Maybe head back

Something at the bottoms of the child
Chopped down my foundations
Bring down the house around me
Like Samson on my head
Forgot something on the stove
Didn't watch it proper
Phone calls to Toronto I forgot to sterilise

You are
All I
All I want
All I want is you
All I
All I
All I want
All I want is you

There's no prediction from the love
After all you think you need it
Then your girl throws the needle
To the bottom of the sea

I don't mind at all
I don't mind at all
And across the kitchen table
Stagger and slow

Something at the bottoms of the child
Shocked down my foundations
Bring down the house around me
Like Samson on my head
Forgot something on the stove
Didn't watch it proper
Phone calls to Toronto I forgot to sterilise

You are
All I
All I want
All I want is you
All I
All I
All I want
All I want is you
All I
All I
All I want
All I want is you
All I
All I
All I want
All I want is you
