I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I say to myself
What a wonderful world
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright sunny days, the dark sacred nights
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow are so pretty in the skies
Are also on the faces of people walkin' by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying "How do you do?"
They're really saying "I love you"
I see babies cry
I what watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself what a wonderful world
World, world
And I say to myself
What a wonderful world, world
