This is the place
Sit down, you're safe now
You've been stuck in a lift
We've been trying to reach you, Thom
This is the place
It won't hurt ever again

The smell of air-conditioning
The fish are belly-up
Empty all your pockets
'Cause it's time to come home

This is the place
Remember me
I'm the face you always see

You've been stuck in a lift
In the belly of a whale
At the bottom of the ocean

The smell of air-conditioning
The fish are belly-up
Empty all your pockets
'Cause it's time to come home
The smell of air-conditioning
The fish are belly-up
Let it go
Today is the first day of the rest of your days
So lighten up, squirt
