Another day, newspapers say
Life, whatchu do to me?
I'm always here, you're always there
Hope, that's my company

Yeah stars of only so many wishes though
They can tell what we already know
See I'm just gathering all my eyes can see through
I'm bearing witness to you, I'm bearing witness to you

Familiar words, the evening stirs
Life, whatchu say to me?
I'm promised here, you're precious there
Love, you're my destiny

Yeah stars of only so many wishes though
They can tell what we already know
See I'm just gathering all my eyes can see through
I'm bearing witness to you, I'm bearing witness

Some days I surrender, some days I resolve
But everyday I conquer with your love
With you love

Yeah stars of only so many wishes though
They can tell what we already know
See I'm just gathering all my eyes can see through
I'm bearing witness to you, I'm bearing witness to you
