Oh I miss the comfort of this house.
Where we are where we are.
Where we are where we are
The floor under our feet whispers out
Come on in come on in, where it all begins.
Can you chase the fire away

Can you chase the fire away
We climbed up to the top in worn out shoes
But she ran down she ran down.
She ran down to the house.
A fox that gains our trust, but then breaks it as he walks
Away form us, away from us.

Can you chase the fire away

Can you chase the fire away
In the fall, we sleep all day
In the fall, we sleep all day
We sleep all day
We sleep all day
We sleep all day

Can you chase the fire away
Can you chase the fire away
In the fall, we sleep all day
In the fall, we sleep all day
