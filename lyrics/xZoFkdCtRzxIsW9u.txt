Come on it's time to go upstairs
But I don't want to be leaving you here
I can't go be in that room alone
When I know that you're down here in tears
I'm not asking "forever" from you
I'm just asking to be held for awhile
In a timeless search for love that might work
Still we're already paying the price
But you need some rest
My darling, it's best
But we've already passed it, I cried
Ooohee...
Listen to me
My secret love secretly
Died

Listen to me
My secret love secretly
Died
Oh, you need some rest
Oh, you need some rest
My darling, it's best
Ooh...
My secret love secretly
Secretly died
