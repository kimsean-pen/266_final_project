Guess I need a brand new start, nah
And I don't mind that, mmm
You were aiming straight for my heart, no
And there's no time for that, there's no time for that

You can keep those promises, promises, promise, yeah
You're a fucking liar (Ah, ah, ah)
And I'ma shake you off like you're nothing, no, nothing, nah
So I'm taking over, I'm taking over

I'm pushing 21
And the pressure's getting ugly
Sorry, gotta run
'Cause you're never gonna help me
I've gotta find my place
Got no more time to waste
You can't keep up with my pace
21, 21, 21, oh-woah

Why you gotta pick me apart? No
Until I'm nothing, ooh
Leaving me out here in the dark, yeah
That's really something, that's really something

You can keep those promises, promises, promise, yeah
You're a fucking liar (Ah, ah, ah, such a liar)
And I'ma shake you off like you're nothing, no, nothing, nah
So I'm taking over (Taking over), I'm taking over (Da-da-da)

I'm pushing 21
And the pressure's getting ugly
Sorry, gotta run (Sorry, gotta run)
'Cause you're never gonna help me
I've gotta find my place
Got no more time to waste
You can't keep up with my pace
21, 21, 21, oh-woah
I'm pushing 21
And the pressure's getting ugly
Sorry, gotta run (Sorry, gotta run)
'Cause you're never gonna help me
I've gotta find my place
Got no more time to waste
You can't keep up with my pace
21, 21, 21, oh-woah

Thank you for nothing
Look what you've done
No, you won't bring me down at 21 (Oh-oh)
I won't feel no shame
Watching you drift out to space
I'll take the great escape
Take the great escape, no

I'm pushing 21
And the pressure's getting ugly (And the pressure's getting ugly)
Sorry, gotta run (Sorry, gotta run)
'Cause you're never gonna help me
I've gotta find my place
Got no more time to waste (Ooh)
You can't keep up with my pace (Ooh)
21, 21, 21, oh-woah

21, 21, 21, 21, oh-woah
21, 21, 21, 21, oh-woah
Ooh, woah, oh-woah
21, 21, 21, 21, woah
