You're the first one
You're the champion
You're the tall one
You're a halcyon

You don't belong to me
You're too far away
And everything falls apart when I try to say

You're in love
In love without me
So, close your heart
You'll never find me
Oh, you can hate me now
'Cause I'll be gone
And I'll be with you or without
(Out, without, out, without)
(Out, without, out, without) oooo
(Out, without, out, without)
(Out, without)

You can count words, you can make it worse
How could I have known you're a universe?
Follow the marks you left
You're the undertone
More that you thought you'd knew
It's so hard to hold

And you're in love
In love without me
So, close your heart
You'll never find me
Oh, you can hate me now
'Cause I'll be gone
And I'll be with you or without
(Out, without, out, without)
(Out, without, out, without)

Oh, I'll keep shivering into the night
I can let you hold me
And tell each other that we might survive
If we keep it going
Oh oooo oh oooo oh oooo oh oooo
(Out, without, out, without)
(Out, without, out, without)

You're in love
In love without me
So, close your heart
You'll never find me
Oh, you can hate me now
'Cause I'll be gone
And I'll be with you or without
(Out, without, out, without, out, without)
And I'll be with you or without
(Out, without, out, without, out, without)
(Out, without, out, without, out, without)
(Out, without, out, without, out, without)
(Out, without, out, without, out, without)
