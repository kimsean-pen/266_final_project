I go to bed
But sleep won't come
Get up in the night
I couldn't stand my feeling no
Early in the morning
Oh mercy
It's just the same situation
Deep in the landlord
Comes a knocking up on my door
He's a knocking up on my door
I've got $400
Month rent to pay
And I can't find a dollar
Let me, let me tell you...

Time tough (time tough)
Everything is out of sight, so hard
(So hard) so hard (so hard)
Time tough (time tough)
Everything is going higher and higher
(Higher and higher)

Sister Lee cannot bear it
Brother Lincoln only stand it now
They crying night and day, louder and louder
Nobody to help them in their way
I've got $400
Month rent to pay
And I can't find a dollar
Let me, Let me tell you...

Good times won't lead into bad times
But the bad times take over
And when I was a little boy
I just kept on feeling it, feeling it

Can't blame the minister
And you can't blame the preacher
And you can't blame your brother
And you cannot blame your sister
Can't blame your friends
'Cause today is judgement day
And that's why everyone have to pray
