Hey Joe
Where are you going with that gun in your hand
Hey Joe
Now tell me where are you going with that gun in your hand
I'm gonna shoot my lady
'Cause I caught her messing around with another man
Yes, I'm going down to shoot my lady
'Cause I caught her messing around with another man

Hey Joe
I heard you just shot your woman down
Hey Joe
I heard you just shot your woman down
Right down to the ground
Yes I did I shot her
You know I shot her 'cause I caught her messing 'round town
Yes I did I shot her
I shot my woman 'cause she was messing 'round town

I gave her the gun - I shot her!

Hey Joe

Hey Joe

Way down South where I'm gonna be free

Way down South maybe outside Mexico Way
I'm gonna run, oh yeah
