Most when it's almost like a bane
You arrive like a siren refrain
Like death, she takes everything
And dazes me like patent medicine
Into this strange divine
The road was serpentine
A network of silken threads
Spider's trapping web
Makes me rue the day
You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright,
alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

Praying at the altar of your legs and feet
Your saliva is a drug so bittersweet
I'll arrogate what's there to take
In an evanescent embrace
Anesthetic liaison
Honey honey you're my medication
Like love, you take everything
And this static yearn
Makes me rue the day
You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, alright
Alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright

Strange divine
Strange divine
Strange divine

I rue the day
You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, alright, alright, alright,
alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
I rue the day
You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, Alright
Alright, alright, alright
You became my pain killer
You became my pain killer
