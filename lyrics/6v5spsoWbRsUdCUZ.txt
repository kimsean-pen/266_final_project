Back down
And touch
The door is shut
In the end
You're just too close
There's no-one here
There's no-one there
I still can't tell
If you'd better try this
And you might find
I'm in your place
I see your face
The air is cold
I'm still on hold
I still can't tell
What's been said

Your Hands around my Throat
Ask me to let go
Your Hands around my Throat
Your Hands around my Throat

Your Hands around my Throat x 4
