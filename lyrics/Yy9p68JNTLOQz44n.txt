(I'm over you, I'm over you)
(I'm over you, I'm over you)

I join the queue on your answer phone,
And all I am is holding breath,
Just pick up I know you're there,
Can't you hear? I'm not myself.
Oh, go ahead and lie to me,
You could say anything,
Small talk will be just fine,
Your voice is everything,
We owe it to love,
And it all depends on you.

So listen up, this sun hasn't set,
I refuse to believe that it's only me feeling,
Just hear me out, I'm not over you yet,
It's love on the line, can you handle it?

So how do I do normal?
The smile I fake, the permanent wave,
Of cue cards and fix-it kits,
Can't you tell? I'm not myself,
I'm a slow motion accident,
Lost in coffee rings and fingerprints,
I don't wanna feel anything but I do,
And it all comes back to you.

So listen up, this sun hasn't set,
I refuse to believe that it's only me feeling,
Just hear me out, I'm not over you yet,
It's love on the line, can you handle it?
So listen up, you've got me strained,
Just hear me out, don't make me wait,
I'm not myself, I can't take this,
Love's on the line, is that your final answer?

I join the queue on your answer phone,
And all I am is holding breath,
Just pick up, I know you're there.

So listen up, this sun hasn't set,
I refuse to believe that it's only me feeling,
Just hear me out, I'm not over you yet,
It's love on the line, can you handle it?

So listen up, this sun hasn't set,
I refuse to believe that it's only me feeling,
Just hear me out, I'm not over you yet,
It's love on the line, can you handle it?

So listen up, this sun hasn't set,
I refuse to believe that it's only me feeling,
Just hear me out I'm not over you yet.
It's love on the line...
