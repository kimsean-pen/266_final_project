Where the wind blows I am
Where the wind blows I will always be

In the pale shadow
The voices around me
Screams in my soul and heart

Where are they?
What are they?
Their faces I can't see
Bur they are in my dark forest
Crawling around the trees
And in the whispering grass
Coveringmy loneliness

In the sunset
In the sunrise
I will always be there

The shivering voice of the ghost
I am the shivering voice of the ghost

No light shall sear my being, my evil being
Soon I shall walk with earthly feet
You summoned me in your dreams
