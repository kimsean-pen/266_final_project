No limits
No hesitation on it
It's what we do and it is ours
No questions
I'm not giving answers for it
It's what we do and it is ours
Shame and regulate
Secrets kept; you make
You're all the same

No limits
No hesitation on it
It's what we do and it is ours

As long as I've got feet I'll run
As long as I'm happy, I'm strong
It's what we do and it is ours
As long as I've got feet, I'll run
Never back down, we're headstrong
It's all we have and it is ours

Corporation, fuck the owners
Fuck politicians
You think you are the ones in charge
Two sides, one that owns you
The other, it's own voice
Step back, rebound and sound alarms

As long as I've got feet I'll run
As long as I'm happy, I'm strong
It's what we do and it is ours
As long as I've got feet, I'll run
Never back down, we're headstrong
It's what we do and it is ours

Shame and regulate
Secrets kept; you make
You're all the same

Dirty pigs in suits and ties
Behold their greed and all their lies
Expose them for all that they hide
for those who strive for better life
Restore their pride
Dirty pigs in suits and ties only protect whose skin is white
Fuck them and their fucked idea
The world is ours to coincide
We will refuse to run to hide
You're all the same

As long as I've got feet I'll run
As long as I'm happy, I'm strong
It's what we do and it is ours
As long as I've got feet, I'll run
Never back down, we're headstrong
It's what we do and it is ours

It's all we have and it is ours
