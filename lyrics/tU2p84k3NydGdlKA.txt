Feels familiar
When the knife gets buried into my
Beating heart
Then I come to
Bloody, bruised
And cursing my own naivet√©
I was on an empty beach
On a screaming all time low
I remember
Meeting you and sharing all these injustices
Let me help she said

I shoulda known better
I know
I shoulda known better
Yeah I know

I was your friend and ended up
Your victim
Victim
I was your friend and ended up
Your victim
Victim

Yeah
Please, release me
Helping hands
Aren't supposed to cut off my oxygen
And why won't you help me
When I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Now I remember why I'm alone

I shoulda known better
I know
I shoulda known better
Yeah I know

I was your friend and ended up
Your victim
Victim
I was your friend and ended up
Your victim
Victim

'Cause you're a
A glitterbomb
'Cause you're a
A glitterbomb

There's only you and I in here
And one of us is acting crazy
There's only you and I in here
And one of us...

I was your friend and ended up
Your victim
Yeah
Ended up your victim
I was your friend and ended up
Your victim
Victim
'Cause you're a
A glitterbomb
'Cause you're a
A glitterbomb
