Inside my own inner space
There's not a soul in the whole place to see or ask me why
And with my senses in shreds
There I go to pick up the loose threads
Away from your hungry eyes

And in that infinite place
You'll see a smile on my blank face
Becuase you can't get there
It's not just being alone
It's more like a view that I've half known
From hills but I don't know where

Imagination
Living mental isolation
Imagination
Imagination
Far from your contamination
Drifting in my inner space
Imagination

And when I look outside
There's a world with nowhere to hide from the cold reality
I've chased innumerable friends
Filled my life with innumerable trends
But it didn't make me see

Imagination
Living mental isolation
Imagination
Imagination
Far from your contamination
Drifting in my inner space
Imagination

But in the depth of a dream
Where the grass is always so green
And the sky is always blue
I'm escaping silently
I'm rejecting violently
This world for something new

Imagination
Living mental isolation
Imagination
Imagination
Far from your contamination
Drifting in my inner space
Imagination
