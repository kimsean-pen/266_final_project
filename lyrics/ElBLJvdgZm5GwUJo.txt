Facing ways down waterslides I try to cling on but I ride
Sometimes it's hard to tell if I chose to slip or if I fell
It seems to just go on and on please let me out been here too long
Is it me who made this place I still don't know a single face

Don't follow me into my dreams you don't belong here
And if you try to sneak on in you might be stuck too
My habitude it might be crumbling now
But the last one I want to go with it is you

Now I'm walking round and round it's like a maze I can't get out
Everyone is in a rush to have some fun but times are tough
There must be something here for me I'm terrified by what I see
When you catch me walking round please wake me up or else I'll drown

Don't follow me into my dreams you don't belong here
And if you try to sneak on in you might be stuck too
My habitude it might be crumbling now
But the last one I want to go with it is you

Don't follow me into my dreams you don't belong here
And if you try to sneak on in you might be stuck too
My habitude it might be crumbling now
But the last one I want to go with it is you

Don't follow me into my dreams you don't belong here
And if you try to sneak on in you might be stuck too
My habitude it might be crumbling now
But the last one I want to go with it is you
