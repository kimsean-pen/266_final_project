You and me
We've been hanging around for the longest time
I know when you're down
Know what you need to get you high
Top down
Like the wind through your hair on a summer's night
Outside
All of your fears, leaving them behind

Baby I'm speeding
And red lights I'll run
What I got you need it
And I'll run to your side when your heart is bleeding
I'm coming to getcha, to getcha, to getcha

I know you've had a rough time
But here I come to hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
But here I come, I'ma hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
But here I come, I'ma hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while making the most of the night

Your eyes wide
Like you've never seen the ocean, never seen the tides
No hope
Now you're seeing things that you'd lost sight of
Taking off
Got your hands in the air and you feeling alright
Gold mines glisten in the skin for you and I

Baby I'm speeding
And red lights I'll run
What I got you need it
And I'll run to your side when your heart is bleeding
I'm coming to getcha, to getcha, to getcha

I know you've had a rough time
But here I come to hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
But here I come, I'ma hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
But here I come, I'ma hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while making the most of the night

Now baby take my hands, now don't you cry
I won't let you stay here, I won't let you hide
No more tears, don't waste another day
Another day
Go on and fight, don't lay down to die
Come on get up, you'll make it through okay
Come on get up, don't waste another day

I know you've had a rough time
But here I come to hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
But here I come, I'ma hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
But here I come, I'ma hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while making the most of the night

Making the most of the night
Making the most of the night
