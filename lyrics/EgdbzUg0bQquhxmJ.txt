You live your life
You live like an Island
Satisfied
You live for the moment
Here you come
You make it look easy
I bet you smile in your sleep
Are you smiling at me

You live your life
You live like an island
Surrounded by, water and silence
Mmm there you go
You make it look easy
I bet you laugh at yourself
Are you laughing at me

Cause sometimes anything goes
When youre looking at me
And sometimes everything goes
When youre looking at me

So come on, come on, everything goes
(When youre looking at me)
Come on, come on, everything goes
(Sometimes when youre smiling at me)
Come on, come on, everything goes

Come on

You live your life
You live like an island
What is it like
I wish I could hold it
Mmm there you go
Making it look easy
I bet you like how it feels
But do you feel me

So come on, come on, anything goes
Come on, come on, everything goes
Come on, come on, everything goes

Cause sometimes anything goes
When youre looking at me
And sometimes everything goes
