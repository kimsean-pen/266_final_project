I lay here stricken on the open sea
What's become of me?
The incessant sound of a distant shore
To a distant shore?

But what if there's nothing here for me?
Just tell me
There's nothing here for me

I can't tear you up
I cannot tear you up
All these currents run to you
Back to you

And now I'm drifting on the open sea
What is left of me
And I keep dreaming of a distant shore
To a distant shore

What keeps calling out for me?
It keeps calling out for me
What keeps calling out for me?
It keeps calling out for me

I can't tear you up
I cannot tear you up
All these currents run to you
Back to you

I cannot tear you up
I cannot tear you up
All these currents run
All these currents run to you
To you, to you, to you, to you
Back to you
