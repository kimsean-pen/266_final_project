I'm told that love is golden
Something to hold when, the going's tough
And I've seen, what love can mean when
Someone believes in, you more than you ever could

I felt that same, same rhythm and the same, same rush
Got that same, same feeling from the same touch
It's like a wildfire growing 'tween my head and my heart

I can only wonder why I can see in colour without you
And I don't wanna try 'cause I see how the colours surround you
You light up the dark in me
You light up the dark in me

I've heard, your vision blurs
Your stomach turns, and you trip over every word

I felt that same, same rhythm and the same, same rush
Got that same, same feeling from the same touch
And it's like a wildfire growing 'tween my head and my heart

I can only wonder why I can see in colour without you
And I don't wanna try 'cause I see how the colours surround you
You light up the dark in me
You light up the dark in me
You light up the dark in me

I can only wonder why I can see in colour without you
And I don't wanna try 'cause I see how the colours surround you
You light up the dark in me
You light up the dark in me
You light up the dark in me
