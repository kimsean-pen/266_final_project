The hour, it's getting late
And it was worth the wait
I know it might be a little bit new
But have you ever thought of the things you could do?

I know it ain't your thing
But you know life's a short thing
I know it ain't your thing
To be this way, oh
But my love is a sure thing

The union affects your taste
Giving you a mind well placed
I know it might seem too good to be true
But have you ever let go of the things you knew?

I know it ain't your thing
But you know life's a short thing
I know it ain't your thing
To be this way, oh
But my love is a sure thing
A sure thing
But my love is a sure thing
A sure thing
But my love is a sure thing

I know it ain't your thing
But my love is a sure thing
Yeah baby
But my love is a sure thing
A sure thing

You know life's a short thing
But my love is a sure thing
A sure thing
But my love is a sure thing
