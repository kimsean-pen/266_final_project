[feat. Beth Orton]

And you start swimming and swimming
And swimming and swimming
And you never stop swimming until you reach the ocean
And you're swimming into the sunset without me

And I find myself suddenly waking up
And there are four young girls
Giving me water from a vine leaf
Just dropping it onto my tongue

Nothing more
You surround me
Break on through
Release me

Nothing more
You surround me
Break on through
Release me

Nothing more
You surround me
Break on through
Release me

Break on through
Release me
Break on through
Release me
Break on through
Release me
