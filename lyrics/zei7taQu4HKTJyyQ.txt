Does the darkness fill you up
Bright flashes, your cheeks flushed
Don't say it don't say it

Because it's still a part of you
It's a part of me as well
We can watch it from a distance

Resistance is futile
Don't shiver from cold out
The sun rise is brutal
Sleep on the fold out

And your lungs are filling up
And you stutter ecstatic
Eyes flutter like an addict

And it's still a part of you
It's a part of me as well
We can watch it from a distance

Resistance is futile
Don't shiver from cold out
The sun rise is brutal
Sleep on the fold out

It's never good unless it's great
You always complicate
All the simple joy, a simple boy
You finally had a taste

Did the darkness let you down
It's just static there's no sound
Don't say it don't say it

Because it's still a part of you
It's a part of me as well
We can watch it in the distance

Resistance is futile
Don't shiver from cold out
The sun rise is brutal
Sleep on the fold out

It's never good unless it's great
You always complicate
All the simple joy, a simple boy
You finally had a taste

Resistance is futile
Don't shiver from cold out
The sun rise is brutal
Sleep on the fold out
