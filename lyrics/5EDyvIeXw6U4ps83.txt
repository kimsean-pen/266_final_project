Wou-ou, yeah yeah
Nothing like the rain
Yeah check it out ya'll
Nothing like the rain
There's nothing like the rain, nothing like the rain
To come and wash away, away the pain

Let me ask a question
Where do we go from here?
Playing games to pass the time, that's OK
'Cause time is on our side

There's nothing like the rain, falling down again
To come and wash away the pain
There's nothing like the rain, falling down again
To clear the air so we see again

Falling down again

If I make a promise
I'll never let you down, no no
Love will always break your heart, so they say
But we can turn that 'round! Oh, baby
There's nothing like the rain, falling down again
To come and wash away the pain
There's nothing like the rain, nothing like the rain
To clear the air so we see again
And we won't give up
No, we won't give in
Check it out, ya'll
When there is so much we can do
And we won't give up
No we won't give in
When there is so much left to do

So much left to do, aw, j'yeah
It's there, can you feel it?
A chance to change the world if you want it
you can give up a lot, but don't give in
Be ready for your break when it comes your way
Today I say, hey, prepare
A break in the clouds you will be heard
Raise your voice, stake your claim
After the storm, after the rain

There's nothing like the rain, falling down again
To come and wash away the pain
There's nothing like the rain
Nothing like the rain
To clear the air so we see again
And we won't give up
No, we won't give in
We won't give in
When there is so much we can do
And we won't give up
No we won't give in
When there is so much left to do
And we won't give up
No, we won't give in
When there is so much we can do
And we won't give up
No we won't give in
When there is so much left to do

Nothing like the rain
Nothing like the rain
Nothing like the rain
Nothing like the rain
Nothing like the rain
