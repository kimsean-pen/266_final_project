I remember your silver ring
On the black and white keys falling
And the colour, the shape of your hand
As you point at the paintings you don't hang

I will forget, piece by piece
I will forget, piece by piece
Into the dark piece by piece
Into the air piece by piece

Sun and moon
I waited here
For you to rise
And disappear now

I will forget piece by piece
I will forget piece by piece
Into the air piece by piece
I will forget piece by piece

Love you can stay
Your scent on my collar
The colour will fade
I know that it's worthless
The chase and decay
It leaves me with worthless love

I will forget piece by piece
I will forget piece by piece

I will forget you piece by piece
I will forget you piece by piece
I will forget you piece by piece
I will forget you piece by piece
I will forget you piece by piece
