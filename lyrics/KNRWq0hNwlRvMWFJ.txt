I got a fever
An inflammation
That's what I got
You turn the heat on me
Some like it hot

Look what you started
A conflagration
Baby, that's what
Don't let the flame go out
Some like it hot

Oh baby, I'm from that old school
I'll play it real cool
But when you kissed me
I lit up
like a four alarm fire

Call out the engine
Ring up the station
I'm on the spot
Love burns you up the most
Like it or not
But baby, I like it hot
