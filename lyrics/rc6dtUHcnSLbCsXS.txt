Hey there beautiful people
Set all your weary wrong
Now, draw the line
Seize the time
Feel the whole, well well

Let's send the beautiful people
Hope and powerful sea
Now, said this man
Within your head
Live free, well well

So lying
So great
So lying

Let's send the beautiful people
You got to stand up one time
How better way for afraid
Stay alive, well well well

You don't have real big children
So what are these friends, well
You gotta guide
So don't you lie
Such a game, girl
