Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, now go cat go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything
But lay off my blue suede shoes
You can knock me down, step in my face
Slander my name all over the place
And do anything that you wanna do
But uh-uh, honey, lay off of my shoes
And don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
Ah, let's go cat
You can burn my house, steal my car
Drink my liquor from a old fruit jar
Do anything that you wanna do
But uh-uh, honey, lay off my shoes
But don't you, step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, now go cat go
But don't you, step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything
But lay off my blue suede shoes
Well, it's blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, yeah
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, baby
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
