Lazy man who can't find his words
All caught up inside his head
He is there with you, he is there with you
And when he can't speak from too much wine,
You're always there with his line
He wants to go home
You know the jolly show must go on
But he sees me on you
And you on summer buzz and summer heat
But I don't know
For go to the picture show today

We're living day by day
And we both know
That this world can make no sense
When you jumped everybody's fence

We're living day by day
And we both know
That this world can make no sense
When you jumped everybody's fence
And you know it can
And you know you can
Know we can, yeah yeah
