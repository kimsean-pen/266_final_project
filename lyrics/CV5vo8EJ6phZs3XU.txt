It's like loving a lion that cannot be tamed
I snap at the thought or the sound of your name
Pulling teeth from my stomach you've been eaten alive
My blood fills your lungs
My soul your inside

My feet they stand on ashes
From the fires that you've made
Burning bridges
Just to save your face

If I say I wouldn't be hostile
Could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken
Tell me who is to blame
Tell me who is to blame

I'm sensing a feeling picking wounds of regret
That left alone there's no scarring I'll dig and I'll dig
Scratching and itching I'll keep biting my lip
From this pain that I'm feeling
Picking wounds of regret

A cut cannot heal
Unless you leave it all alone
I'll open mine daily
Leaving bones exposed
Exposed

If I say I wouldn't be hostile
Could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken
Tell me who is to blame
Tell me who is to blame
To blame

Standing on ashes from the fires you've made
Burning your bridges just to save your face
Burn
Wounds of regret

If I say I wouldn't be hostile
Could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken
Tell me who is to blame
Tell me who is to blame
To blame

We're broken, imperfect
We are all made the same
We're broken
We're broken, imperfect
We are all to blame
