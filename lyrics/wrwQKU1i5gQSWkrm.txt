Last year's wishes
Are this year's apologies
Every last time I come home
I take my last chance
To burn a bridge or two
I only keep myself this sick in the head
Cause I know how the words get you

We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger
But not any better off
Bulletproof loneliness
At best
At best

Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
(If I woke up next to you)
(If I woke up next to you)
Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
(If I woke up next to you)
(If I woke up next to you)

Collect the bad habits
That you couldn't bear to keep
Out of the woods but I love
A tree I used to lay beneath
Kissed tear stained red
From the sour bottle baby girl
With eyes the size of baby worlds

We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger
But not any better off
Bulletproof loneliness
At best
At best

Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
(If I woke up next to you)
(If I woke up next to you)
Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
(If I woke up next to you)
(If I woke up next to you)

Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
(A honeymoon)
(If I woke up next to you)
(If I woke up next to you)

Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
(Honeymoon)
(A honeymoon)
(If I woke up next to you)
(If I woke up next to you)

And the best
Way to make it through
With hearts and wrists intact
Is to realise
Two out of three ain't bad
Ain't bad

Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
(If I woke up next to you)
(If I woke up next to you)

Me and you
(You)
(Honeymoon)
Setting in a honeymoon
(A honeymoon)

Me and you
(You)
Setting in a honeymoon
(Honeymoon)
(A honeymoon)
(If I woke up next to you)
(If I woke up next to you)

Me and you
(You)
Setting in a honeymoon
(Honeymoon)
(A honeymoon)
(If I woke up next to you)
(If I woke up next to you)

(Honeymoon)
