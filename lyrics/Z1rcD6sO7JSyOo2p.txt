We're the people, the lucky
with the fragile bones
the ones who sit and worry
about getting to old
We're the people, the happy
with the broken hearts
the ones who draw a picture
and proclaim that it's art

But you, and you, and you and you
you're just a animal developed into
You and you and you and you
a monkey needs to dance so do you

We're the people, the lucky
with the fragile bones
the ones who sit and worry
about catching a cold
We're the people, the happy
with the broken hearts
the ones who draw a picture
and proclaim that it's art

But you, and you, and you and you
you're just a animal developed into
You and you and you and you
a monkey needs to dance so do you

You like to do it as a child on your own
you're in the jungle and the monkeys
take your mind from your home
How many times do they have to tell you
that it's perfectly fine for you to dance around
naked when you're all by yourself

Cause' you, and you, and you and you
you're just a animal developed into
You and you and you and you
a monkey needs to dance so do you

We're the people, the lucky
with the fragile bones
the ones who sit and worry
about getting to old
You're the monkey in the jungle
trying to find your place
the one who let the sunset
bring a silly kind of smile on your face

You, and you, and you and you
you're just a animal developed into
You and you and you and you
a monkey needs to dance so do you

You like to do it as a child on your own
you're in the jungle and the monkeys
take your mind from your home
How many times do they have to tell you
that it's perfectly fine for you to dance around
naked when you're all by yourself

Cause you, and you, and you and you
you're just a animal developed into
You and you and you and you
a monkey needs to dance so do you
