Hey baby
Why'd you turn away
I was about to say that
Something baby
I thought would make you smile
At least for a little while
Oh well baby
That's the way it goes
Right from my head to my toes
And you're the first to know
That I've got a brilliant plan
I hope you understand
I want to meet in two thousand and three
I want to see what the future can bring to me
I want to
And when I do I'll meet you here my darling yeah
And when I'm free
I'll be waiting where I said I would be my love
Will you wait for me
What we've found
Is such a precious thing
And that's what I'm trying to sing but
Before I lose my nerve
I better write down these words
'cause I don't know what you heard
I want to meet in two thousand and three
I want to see what the future can bring to me
I want to
And when I do I'll meet you here my darling yeah
And when I'm free
I'll be waiting where I said I would be my love
Will you wait for me
And you know that I won't change my mind
I made a promise to be true
Let them say that it's a selfish game
But I won't play with anyone but you
I want to meet in two thousand and three
I want to see what the future can bring to me
I want to
And when I do I'll meet you here my darling yeah
And when I'm free
I'll be waiting where I said I would be my love
I meet you here in two thousand and three
I want to see what the future can bring to me
I want to
And when I do I'll meet you here my darling yeah
And when I'm free
I'll be waiting where I said I would be my love
I'll be waiting where I said I would be my love
Will you wait for me
