As I sit back relax, steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex
I'd probably go to jail for fucking Patti LaBelle
Oooh, Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly, Mariah Carey's kinda scary
Wait a minute, what about my honey, Mary?
Them jeans, they fitting like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses
I'ma show you who the boss of intercourse is
Sex, I'm taking no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC
Can't see B.I.G. with telepathy
The recipe, a pinch of hardcore with a gun
Pimping ain't easy, but it sure is fun
When I bust my nuts, I bust 'em one by one
So what's the four one one, hun?

Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing, but I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing, I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing, but I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing, I'm saying

I'll put Chante Moore pussy in stitches
I'll fuck RuPaul before I fuck them ugly ass X-Scape bitches
You can seventy six the sixty nine, try sixty eight
Make Raven-Symon√© call date rape
Only 'cause I'm paid, I'm fucking all of Jade
And my DJ Zhane she likes it when they say
"Everybody move your body"
Got Whitney Houston boosted from Bobby
As I bust the cherry of Monica and Terry
Backshots to Chaka, I know that pussy hairy
Sade, ooh I know that pussy tight
Smack Tina Turner give her flashbacks of Ike
Smoke a stoge, fucking En Vogue because it's four of them
Jimmy hats for Patra, I'm using all of them
(What about Toni Braxton?)
If that bitch give me action
Guaranteed satisfaction

Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing, but I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing, I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing, but I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing, but I'm saying

I'm just playing, but I'm saying
I'm just playing, but I'm saying
I'm just playing, but I'm saying
I'm just playing, I'm saying
