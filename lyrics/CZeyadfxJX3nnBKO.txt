Wake up, look me in the eyes again
I need to feel your hand upon my face
Words can be like knives
They can cut you open
And then the silence surrounds you and haunts you

I think I might've inhaled you
I could feel you behind my eyes
You've gotten into my bloodstream
I could feel you flowing in me

Words can be like knives
They can cut you open
And then the silence surrounds you and haunts you

I think I might've inhaled you
I could feel you behind my eyes
You've gotten into my bloodstream
I can feel you flowing in me

The spaces in between
Two minds and all the places they have been
The spaces in between

I try to put my finger on it
I try to put my finger on it

I think I might've inhaled you
I could feel you behind my eyes
You've gotten into my bloodstream
I could feel you flowing in me

I think I might've inhaled you
I could feel you behind my eyes
You've gotten into my bloodstream
I could feel you flowing in me
