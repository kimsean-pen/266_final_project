Hand me down my walkin' cane
Hand me down my hat
Hurry now and don't be late
'Cause we ain't got time to chat

You and me we're goin' out
To catch the latest sound
Guaranteed to blow your mind
So high you won't come down
'Cause...

Hey y'all prepare yourself for the Rubberband Man
You've never heard a sound
Like the Rubberband Man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Ohhh this dude is outta sight!
Everything he does seems to come out right

Once I went to hear them play
At a club outside of town
I was so surprised
I was hypnotized
By the sound this cat's puttin' down

When I saw this short fat guy
Stretch a band between his toes
Hey, I laughed so hard
'Cause the man got down
When he finally reached his goal

Hey y'all prepare yourself for the Rubberband Man
You've never heard a sound
Like the Rubberband Man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Got that rubberband... uhh
Up on his toes
And then he wriggled it up
All around his nose

(Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Playin' all that music, yet keepin' time
(Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Where in the world did he learn that? Oh, Lord huh!
(Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Lord, help him get away

Hey y'all prepare yourself for the Rubberband Man
You've never heard a sound
Like the Rubberband Man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Oh rubberband man, rubberband man
How much of this stuff do he think we can stand? (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
So much rhythm, grace and debonair from one man, Lord! (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
And then he had nerve to wiggle his left toe (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
To his knee, got the feelin' in his head, y'all (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Ah, come on, baby

Hey y'all prepare yourself for the Rubberband Man
You've never heard a sound
Like the Rubberband Man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Rubberband Man starts to jam
Movin' up and down across the land
Got people all in his ways
Everything about him seems out of place

Just a movin', just a movin' (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Just a move-move-movin'
A rubberband, Rubberband Man
Just a movin', just a movin' (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Just a move-move-movin'
Just a Rubberband
Rubberband Man
Get down (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Oh, get down lover
Uh-huh (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
