Pleased to meet you
Pleased to have you on my plate
Your meat is sweet to me
Your destiny
Your fate
You're my life support,
Your life is my sport

I'm a man-eating machine
I'm a man
A man-eating machine

You won't hear me laughing
As I terminate your day
You can't trace my footsteps,
As i walk the other way

I can't get enough prey
(i'm a man-eating machine)
Pray for me
I can't get enough prey
(i'm a man-eating machine)
Pray for me

Corporate cannibal
digital criminal
corporate cannibal
Digital criminal
Corporate cannibal
eat you like an animal

employer of the year,
grandmaster of fear
my blood flows satanical,
mechanical,
masonical and chemical
habitual ritual

I'm a man-eating machine
I'm a man
I'm a man-eating machine

I deal in the market,
every man, woman and child is a target
A closet full of faceless
nameless pay more for less
Emptyness

i'll make you scrounge
in my executive lounge
you pay less tax, but i'll gain more back
my rules, you fools

we can play the money game
greedgame,
power game,
stay insane
lost in the cell, in this hell
slave to the rhythm
of the corporate prison

i'm a man-eating machine...
i can't get enough prey
pray for me
i can't get enough prey
corporate cannibal...
digital criminal...
I'm a corporate cannibal
Corporate cannibal
Digital criminal
Eat you like an animal

i'll consume my consumers
with no sense of humour
i'll give you a uniform, chloroform
Sanitize,
homogenize,
vaporize... you

i'm the spark,
make the world explode
i'm a man-eating machine,
i'll make the world explode
corporate cannibal
Corporate cannibal
Eat you like an animal
