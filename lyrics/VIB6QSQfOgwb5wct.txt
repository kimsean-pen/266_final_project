(Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)

(Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)
(Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)

You've got these little things
That you've been running from
You'll either love it or guess you don't
You're such a pretty thing
To be running from anyone
A vision with nowhere to go

So tell me right now
You think you're ready for it?
I wanna know why you got me going

So let's go, Well take it out of here
I think I'm ready to leave, I'm ready to live

I'm ready to go
(Get me out of my mind)
(Get me out of my mind)
I'm ready to go
(Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)
(Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)

You've got these little things
You wanted something more
You'll either get it or guess you won't
What does it really mean to get nothing from anyone?
There's a million ways it could go

So tell me right now
You think you're ready for it?
I wanna know why you got me going

So let's go, Well take it out of here
I think I'm ready to leave, I'm ready to live

I'm ready to go
(Get me out of my mind)
(Get me out of my mind)
I'm ready to go
(Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)
(Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)

I think I'm ready, I think I know I'm ready
I know, I think I'm ready, I think I know I'm ready
I know, I think I'm ready, I think I know I'm ready
I know, I think I'm ready, I think I know I'm ready

I'm ready to go
(Get me out of my mind)
(Get me out of my mind)
I'm ready to go
(Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)
(Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)

I'm ready to go-oh-oh-oh
(Get me out of my mind)
(Get me out of my mind)
(I think I'm ready, I think I know I'm ready, I know I think I'm ready...)

I'm ready to go-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh

I'm ready to go-oh-oh-oh
(Get me out of my mind)
(Get me out of my mind)

I'm ready to go
Oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh
