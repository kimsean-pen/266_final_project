Box springs are stained with yellow pillows
Held our heads down
Holding the rain outside on the curb
Where I wasted half of your life
Both of our lives

Everything's closer to the end but
I will get farther from you
Everything's closer, it's the end but
I will get further from you

Your eyes are blue
But I can't see that color hue
It's been so dang long
God, I was wrong

I'm dead to you, you say we are friends but
What is a friend when there is a man who
Sleeps in your bed too

Everything's closer to the end but
I will get farther from you
Everything's closer, it's the end but
I will get further from you

I was wrong, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong

Everything's closer to the end but
I will get farther from you
I will get farther from you
I will get farther from you
I will get farther form you
I will get farther from you
