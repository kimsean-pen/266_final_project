You're special
Yours truly
You pull me deep into my deepest desire
Can you meet me in the midnight?
Call me, hit me, 'cause I know you
You know me
When I'm fading
You're the only one who inspires
Can you meet me in the midnight?

Maybe I love you
Maybe I want to
Maybe I need you
Oh, yeah
Maybe I love you
Don't let me fall through
Now that I need you
I feel this magic is never gonna fade
I ain't got nothing to say

But you're precious
I'm scheming
Keep dreaming
'Bout a world where we are an item
Can I miss you in the daylight?
Whenever you're around, I'm lifted
So lifted, oh yeah
And this moment is made for you and I to go higher
Higher, higher, higher
Can you meet me in the midnight?
Maybe I love you
Maybe I want to
Maybe I need you
Oh, yeah
Maybe I love you

Don't let me fall through
Now that I need you
I feel this magic is never gonna fade
I ain't got nothing to say
Maybe I love you
Maybe I want to
Maybe I need you
Oh, yeah
Don't let me fall through
Now that I need you
I feel this magic is never gonna fade
I ain't got nothing to say
Maybe I love you
Maybe I want to
Maybe I need you
Maybe I want you
Maybe I love you
Don't let me fall through
Now that I need you
Oh yeah
Maybe I need you
