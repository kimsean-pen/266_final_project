My name calling all night
I can pull the wool while I'm being polite
Like, darling calling all night
I can be a bull while being polite
Like, oh me, oh me oh my
I know many women want to be in my life
Like, oh me, oh me oh my
Why can't every woman end up being my wife
Even if she go away, even if she go away

Even if she go away, even if she go away
I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G
I'm a classic man

Your needs get met by the street, elegant old-fashioned man
Yeah, baby, I'm a classic man
I burn through the hood like, "Whoa"
When everybody's feeling so cold
I cool like Nat King Cole and niggas get a bit of my glow
I got charm like a leprechaun, mommafucker
Now y'all fucking with the wrong mommafucker

Treat me like a don, mommafucker
And we don't live by the law, mommafucker

Even if she go away, even if she go away
Even if she go away, even if she go away
I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G

I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old-fashioned man
Yeah, baby, I'm a classic man
I burn through the gate, like whoa
And everybody get in we know
I love life, living like gold
And niggas wanna get in my glow
I got mad love for my crew, mu'fucker
I'm the - I'm the man, who you mu'fucker?
Shine bright like a jewel, mummafuker
Even under fire I'm cool, mummafucker
Even if she go away, even if she go away
Even if she go away, even if she go away
I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G
I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old-fashioned man
Yeah, baby, I'm a classic man
Keep my glove dirty but my hands clean
Got to keep the business in the family

Breadwinner filling up the pantry
Now my niggas slang cane like a dandy
I'll tell you how it go
You pull out rubber bands, I pull out an envelope
The ladies on my elbows ain't for the show

Every madame on my team is a top general, oh
Got to be ready for war, war
Should they get into my door, door
Get 'em, we'll get 'em, I know that we'll get 'em
Cause I lived through this shit before, oh
I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G
I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old-fashioned man
Yeah, baby, I'm a classic man
I'm a classic man
I'm a classic man
I'm a classic man
Old fashioned man
I'm a classic man
