I stand apart from the rest
I had so much to give
where does my life go
those close to me may know
I've squandered my time
got rid of that dream of mine
and now you can't stay
please baby, don't go away

just give
me more time
I'll change my mind
I'll change
I'll change

I stand apart from the rest
I now must confess
I play a selfish game
only I'm the one to blame
I have squandered my mind
got rid of that dream of mine
and now you gotta leave
baby take pity on me
we can leave all the pain behind
gettin rid of that vice of mine

just give
me more time
I'll change my mind
I'll change
I'll change

I'll change my mind, I'll change
