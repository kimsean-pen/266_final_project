Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful

I could tell by the color of your energy field
U thought this game was over
Chemical peel
You tried to do me like my good brother steve
But eye got another funky
Trick up my sleeve
Expecting me to freak on you a little bit more
But you get nothin but well-wishes
and flowers galore
I mean no harm
I still got ur back
U can come and drink my wine
As a matter of fact

Just feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful

I don't know what you thought
When you spit in my face
But this dimension ain't the time
Or the place
I don't know who told you you could
Stand next to me
Cuz eye got a guitar that could
Part the sea
Don't mean no disrespect
I ain't tryin' to brag
But that might b the same one that
Tapped on the crag

And brought fourth the water
That quenched ur thirst
And we'll keep feeding ya
But first things first!

Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful

Feel better
feel good

If you think about how much time it took
Four you to try to get a page in my book
I feel so good right now
I just can't recall
What the __ I was thinking when eye
Threw you the ball

It hit three bystanders after you touched it
Now they wanna sue me but they love me to much
Cuz they know eye wish them heaven and all of its gold
Same to you, come on let's groove
to the purple rock 'n roll

Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful

Better than good, better than good,
You know you should feel wonderful
Keep your mind in the vertical motion
Always looking up

Hit me!

Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful

Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
