Deadly she was
Young little girl
Falling in love
Lead by a fool

Sucker blue kiss saddened her heart
Now she lies all alone dead from the start

Deadly doll
Breaking her heart
Deadly doll
Lay your damn soul
She's a laced up little vamp
Put on her dark dress
She's the daughter of the damned
Pretty unveiled
Deadly doll, deadly doll

Baby's gone mad
Driving rounded
Faded in June
Drunked out on doom

Sucker blue kiss blackened her heart
Now she lies all alone dead from the start

Deadly doll
Breaking her heart
Deadly doll
Lay your damn soul
She's a laced up little vamp
Put on her dark dress
She's the daughter of a crime
Pretty unveiled

She's a laced up little vamp
Put on her dark dress
She's the daughter of the damned
Pretty unveiled

Deadly doll
