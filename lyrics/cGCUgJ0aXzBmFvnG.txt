Ignite the fire of all creation
cauterize the loins from which it bears
praise the birth of disintegration
the decaying of our embers flare

Into the pits where we must fall
the trying fires will consume us all
confined, convicted, condemned to burn
radiant be the path of no return

Our own temple will turn to ash
supernova searing the souls of man
sudden strikes with light & flash
smoldering stone walls now crumble like sand

Into the pits where we must fall
the trying fires will consume us all
confined, convicted, condemned to burn
radiant be the path of no return

We are but ashes in the earn
accommodating the gift of fire
for no boulder will go unturned
scorched earth funeral pyre

Let us kindle those who observe
lighting up the next of flesh
blistering down to our last nerve
bidding farewell in its final caress
