You can't bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me down!

I'm good, I'm fine, this life divine
No hate, no shame, no one to blame
You might disguise, your life with lies
I won't chastise

Even if you think you can bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me down, down, down, down, down!
You won't ever bring me down, down, down, down, down!
You won't ever bring me

I can't escape from your disdain
Your hurt, your pain, your drama is lame
Why can't you find some peace inside
I won't chastise

Even when you think you can bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me down, down, down, down, down!
You won't ever bring me down, down, down, down, down!
You won't ever bring me
