I'm having an awful time
You said you would get me high
But you took me out my mind
Way down to the other side
Bad trip
On a bad trip
On a bad trip
On a bad trip

Like a child in a womb, with no room to grow
In a world I didn't know, I'm confused and cold
Oh no
Now you show me all the things I could never see
In a new reality I cannot believe, not believe
Bad trip

I thought you loved me
Someone get me some help
You told me you loved me
You're a liar, you're a liar, I hate you, I hate you
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
Where am I?
Just calm down
Don't touch me
