I know you're out there, I know you're fine
i know you probably think about this all the time
We come together, we fall apart
We make some noise inside a room and call it art

Don't worry if it's a cold night, cause we all go up in flames
We fall heavy but we're so light, so leave the door wide open

So I go out there, I work the room
Exchange a face or two with everyone but you
I'm coming over, to find your smile
But you've already warmed the cab for half a mile

Don't worry if it's a cold night, cause we all go up in flames
We fall heavy but we're so light, so leave the door wide open

...there she goes
She's leaving town beside a man she hardly knows
But then she calls me, he broke her heart
Now she's collecting all the pieces of her love before the light gets dark

Don't worry if it's a cold night, cause we all go up in flames
We fall heavy but we're so light, so leave the door wide open

There's an actress in the hall
- leave the door wide open now -
Now she's comparing what she's caught
- leave it all wide open -
And as the orchestra comes in
- leave the door wide open now -
And now she's tearing out her mind
- leave it all wide open â€“
You watch her do this every time
- leave the door wide open now -
But you still want her how she is
- leave it all wide open -
My convoluted happiness
- we leave the door wide open now -

We come together, we fall apart
We make some noise inside a room and call it art

Don't worry if it's a cold night, cause we all go up in flames
We fall heavy but we're so light, so leave the door wide open
