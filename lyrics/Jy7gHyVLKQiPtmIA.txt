Last night I dreamt in slow motion
You and I made our way across the ocean
When we reached the shore
We turned around and we run on by

Last night I dreamt as we were floatin'
With the stars above us softly glowin'
I turned to take your hand
We sailed away from dry land

Slow wave
Baby catch a slow wave
Tonight, with me
Close your eyes and you can see it comin'

Ten fingers on both of our hands
Two feet flyin' high above land
One dream we see
We had it all
When you called out, baby

Slow wave
Baby catch a slow wave
Tonight, with me
Close your eyes and you can see it comin'

Told my baby I'd be back
I can see my reflection
I can see my reflection
Lookin' in, I run for cover, nothin'
I can see my reflection
I can see my reflection
Lookin' in

I told my baby I'd be back
I can see my reflection
I can see my reflection
Lookin' in, I run for cover, nothin'
I can see my reflection
I can see my reflection
When you look at me
