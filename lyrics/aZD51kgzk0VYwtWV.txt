Now that I got your attention, you better listen up
'Cause I got questions
So why you late night texting?
And why you liking every pic of my best friend?
I get ya, get ya, get ya shit together (uh uh)
I get ya, get ya, get ya shit together (uh uh)
Boy, I got 20/20 vision
And that's the reason I'ma keep my distance

Must be confused about me (what?)
Must be confused about me (what?)
Boy, no room for fools around me
Ayy, ayy, ayy

If you don't treat ya mama right, bye-bye, bye bye
If you got another chick on the side, bye bye, bye bye
You look everywhere but my eyes, bye bye, bye bye
It's gonna be a lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely night, bye bye
Lonely lonely lonely lonely
Lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely night
Lonely lonely lonely lonely
Lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely night

Yeah, if you don't learn your lesson
You can get yourself in permanent detention
If you want my love and affection
You better make a good impression
Get ya, get ya, get ya shit together (uh uh)
Get ya, get ya, get ya shit together (uh uh)
Yeah, I got 20/20 vision (got 20/20)
And that's the reason I'ma keep my distance

Must be confused about me ('bout me)
Must be confused about me ('bout me)
No room for fools around me ('round me)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

If you don't treat ya mama right, bye-bye, bye bye
If you got another chick on the side, bye bye, bye bye (and you know I don't want you, baby)
You look everywhere but my eyes, bye bye, bye bye (oh, no)
It's gonna be a lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely night, bye bye (bye bye)
Lonely lonely lonely lonely
Lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely night (lonely night)
Lonely lonely lonely lonely (lonely night)
Lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely night

This your woman, so get it right
If you don't, then I'll say, "Bye-bye"
Have a L-O-N-E-L-Y
La-la-la lonely night (la-la-la lonely night)
This your woman, so get it right (it right)
If you don't, then I'll say, "Bye-bye" ("Bye-bye")
Have a L-O-N-E-L-Y
La-la-la lonely night (la-la-la lonely night)
Lonely, lonely, lonely night, yeah

If you don't treat ya mama right, bye-bye, bye bye (bye-bye, bye bye)
If you got another chick on the side, bye bye, bye bye (bye-bye, bye bye)
You look everywhere but my eyes, bye bye, bye bye (woah)
It's gonna be a lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely night, bye bye
Oh
It's gonna be a lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely night, bye bye
Oh
It's gonna be a lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely night, bye bye
