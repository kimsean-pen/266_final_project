Night has fallen quickly on the carnival in town
The cotton candy maker is the last to leave the ground
Shuts his tiny wagon and goes to a room somewhere
His life's like cotton candy, an illusion not much there

Another man is working in a park across the town
With pointed stick he picks up paper scattered on the ground
Slowly does he walk and vent, his feet they are so sore
There's no one to complain to, though he's tried at times before

Tick tock
Time comes and then it's gone
Tick tock
In the end it's faced alone

Paint a lady dressed up in the finest sequin gown
Colour her your favourite shade of yellow, pink and brown
Paint a lady, give her strands of tinsel all her own
Then you will not have to go on living life alone

Still another standing on the corner of the street
People glance but hurry by, for fear their eyes might meet
He sells his red balloon so he'll sleep in a bed at night
He'll chance he'll have one for there's no parade in sight

Tick tock
Time comes and then it's gone
Tick tock
In the end it's faced alone

Paint a lady dressed up in the finest sequin gown
Colour her your favourite shade of yellow, pink and brown
Paint a lady, give her strands of tinsel all her own
Then you will not have to go on living life alone
