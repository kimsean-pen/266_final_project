Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn
I push it down, push it down
See I'm the one "for a good time call"

Phone's blowin' up
They're ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the love

One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back, till I lose count

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist

I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier

And I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight

Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight

Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame

One, two, three, one, two, three drink
One, two, three, one, two, three drink
One, two, three, one, two, three drink
Throw 'em back till I lose count

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist

I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier

And I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life

Won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight

On for tonight
On for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
On for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
On for tonight
