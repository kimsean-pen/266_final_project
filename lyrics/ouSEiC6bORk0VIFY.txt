Black sheep, come on

Hello again, friend of a friend, I knew you when

Our common goal was waiting for the world to end

Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend

You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick the past again

I'll send you my love on a wire

Lift you up everytime

Everyone, ooh

Pulls away, ooh
From you
Ooh ooh
Got balls of steel, got an automobile for a minimum wage
Got real estate, I'm buying it all up in outerspace
Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick, the past again
I'll send you my love on a wire
Lift you up everytime
Everyone, ooh
Pulls away, ooh
It's a mechanical bull, the number one
You'll take a ride from anyone
Everyone wants a ride
And pulls away, oooh
From you
Ooh ooh
