I've got myself all wrapped together
the only way I know how
not too tight a little loose
the only way I know how
so let the sky fall in my hair
and I wonder within
what makes the breakers in the sky
who tells the tide to come in

Please don't disturb this finest hour
in its most perfect form
don't scare the dancing clouds
or they shall cease to perform

There they go into the distance
I know it won't be long low
I'd like to catch and keep one
if I only knew how
if I only knew how
