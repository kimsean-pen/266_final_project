(JUSTIN, JC, & JOEY) Wherever I go, whatever I do,
Whenever my heart is crying out for you
Wherever I go, Whatever I do
I'm crazy for you

(JC) It's not easy to be alone
It's not easy to fall in love
Every night I just get down and pray
(JOEY IN BACKGROUND) That you come my way

(JUSTIN) I've never had a girl like you (girl like you...)
I've never known what love could do
Wish you'd come baby and set me free
I can't let it be, yeah

(ALL) Wherever I go, whatever I do,
Whenever my heart is crying out for you
Wherever I go, Whatever I do
I'm crazy for you

(ALL) I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm gonna, I'm gonna make it true
I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm crazy for you

(ALL) I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm gonna, I'm gonna make it true
I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm crazy for you

(JC) I'm waiting for the phone to ring
And all the wonder love should bring
All the things darling I left behind
Please give me a sign...

(JUSTIN) A little smile would light my life
And a single touch would blow my mind
Girl you know, by now you've got to be mine
Till the end of time...

(ALL) Wherever I go, whatever I do,
Whenever my heart is crying out for you
Wherever I go, Whatever I do
I'm crazy for you

(ALL) Wherever I go, whatever I do,
Whenever my heart is crying out for you
Wherever I go, Whatever I do
I'm crazy for you

(ALL) I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm gonna, I'm gonna make it true
I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm crazy for you

(ALL) I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm gonna, I'm gonna make it true
I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm crazy for you
