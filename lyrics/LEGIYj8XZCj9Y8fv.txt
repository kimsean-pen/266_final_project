We are conductors of sound, heat and energy
And I bet that you thought you had us figured out from the start
We are conduits of clear electricity
Now you're back on the pitch to take the apparatus apart

You're an ancient now
You're an ancient now
You're an ancient now on your own

Rebels
Teachers
Strikers
Sweepers
Better
Protected
Whenever
Collected

We are troubled by your soft curiosity
But delighted to be anti everything you were taught
Are you put off by our footloose fluidity
Have your hurt caucasian feelings left you so distraught?

Are you quite done now?
Are you quite done now?
Are you quite done now? Not at all

Workers
Authors
Poets
Stoppers
Power
Resembled
If we are
Assembled

Only through those
Who stay awake
Can an institution
Be dismantled
It is dishonest
Nay a sin
To stand for any anthem
That attempts to drown
Out the roar of oppression (Hesse total football)
Twombly total football
Tzara total football
Mina total football
Panthers total football
KoBrA Total Football
Dada total football
Beatles total football

Swapping parts and roles
Is not acting but
Rather
Emancipation
From expectation
Collectivism and autonomy
Are not mutually exclusive
Those who find discomfort
In your goals of liberation
Will be issued
No apology
And fuck Tom Brady!
