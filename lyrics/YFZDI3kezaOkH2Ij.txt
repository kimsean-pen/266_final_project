Time for sleep
Time for prayers
Time for dusk
Dust in eyes
Grinning jaws
Grit in teeth
All things pass
Death and deeds

Break the black ice

In this earth
In this town
In this land
In this hour
In this time
For this age
In this flesh
In this joining

Break the black ice

In this spasm
In this jerk
In this city
A little death
For this boy
Little screams
A little blood
A tattooed rune

Break the black ice

In this kiss... Not yours not mine
In this curse... Not yours not mine
In this kiss... Not yours not mine
In this curse... Not yours not mine
