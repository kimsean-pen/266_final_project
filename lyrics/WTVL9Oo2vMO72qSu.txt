Oh I think I smell a rat
I think I smell a rat
All you little kids
Seem to think you know
Just where it's at
I think I smell a rat
Walking down the street
Carrying a baseball bat
I think I smell a rat

Oh I think I smell a rat
I think I smell a rat
All you little kids
Seem to think you know
Just where is at
I think I smell a rat
Treating your mother and father
Like a welcome mat
I think I smell a rat
