Close
Come close

Going on a living spree
Plenty wanna come with me
You don't wanna miss your chance
Near-life experience
Faces making noise
Say, be good girls and boys
It ain't half empty or full
You can break the glass, or drink it all
Dig it

Close
Come close
Close
Come close

A grand macabaret
The last float on parade
'Cause their sleep got left behind
Every puzzle piece of mind
Handshake in facade
Play the fool or playing God
Just for God's sake play along
Well, you can have a laugh, hit it
Du-du-du-du-duah!
Dudududu-duuu-du-du
Du-du-du-du-duah!
Dudududu-duuu-du-du
Du-du-du-du-duuu

Diving
Falling no different
I fall beyond definitions now
Commence

Close
Come close
Close
Come close

Going on a living spree
You really wanna come with me
They couldn't miss the chance
Near-life experience

We're all a little tangled
We're all a little mangled
Yeah, unfold, let it go
Yeah, unfold, let it go
Yeah, unfold, let it go
Yeah, unfold, let it go

Here we come
Here we come
Here we come
Here we come
Get outta' the way
Here we come
Get outta' the way
Matters not
What the people say
Matters not
What the people say
'Cause here we come
Here we come
Here we come
Get outta the way
