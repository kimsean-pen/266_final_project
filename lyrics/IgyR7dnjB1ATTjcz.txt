Did you scream? Did you suffer?
Does it help you do more?
Does it pay up when you wake up
And the last word is yours?

We could be more, don't you run away
We could be happier this way
You could do more, don't you run away
We could be happier.

Could I make it more clear?
Could I give you more time?
Did I say enough
Or did I say too much?

Could I make it more clear?
Could I give you more time?
Did I say enough
Or maybe I said too much?

Let me in, let me wonder
Let me worry where you've been
Let me in, you can find me
When you find me we begin.

We could be more, don't you run away
We could be happier this way
You could do more, don't you run away
We could be happier.

Could I make it more clear?
Could I give you more time?
Did I say enough
Or did I say too much?

Could I make it more clear?
Could I give you more time?
Did I say enough
Or maybe I...

Could I make it more clear?
Could I give you more time?
Did I say enough
Or did I say too much?
Could I make it more clear?
Could I give you more time?
Did I say enough
Or maybe I said too much?
Or maybe I said too much...
