I guess being clever's just my safety net

I hide behind my cadence
I hide behind the walls
I built so tall the weakness never spills

I hide all of my burdens
I twist my words so well
I'm breaking but a lie is what I sell

If I'm clever you might never understand
I feel like death and me are working hand in hand
When my happiness is hanging by a thread I finally feel content
I guess being clever's just my safety net

I tell you I feel better
I tell you I can sleep
I hope that it can bring a sense of peace

When all the nights are getting darker
The day becomes so bleak
Another day I'm conscious is another day I bleed

If I'm clever you might never understand
I feel like death and me are working hand in hand
When my happiness is hanging by a thread I finally feel content

If I'm messed up and inconsistent in my head
I feel my passing only battle fits my friends
I know nothing I say matters, in the end I finally feel content
I guess being being clever's just my safety net

I'm out of ways to answer
I'm out of metaphors
I finally got so sick, there is no cure

I'm out of ways to answer
I'm out of metaphors
I finally got so sick, there is no cure

If I'm clever you might never understand
I feel like death and me are working hand in hand
When my happiness is hanging by a thread I finally feel content

If I'm messed up and inconsistent in my head
I feel my passing only battle fits my friends
I know nothing I say matters, in the end I finally feel content
I guess being being clever's just my safety net
