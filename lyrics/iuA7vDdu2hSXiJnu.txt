My body is numb I feel no touch
Feed the fear and feel no clutch
Feel the fear of what's to come
If you don't fear no need to run
You're neither the master nor the slave
Willing it faster laws are laid

Only you can say my name
Only you my saving grace

Til I die I waste away
Remember my soul forget my face

Only you can say my name
Only you can say my name

When I'm swallowed by this waves
When my form begins to fade

Only you can say my name
Only you can say my name
Only you
Only you
Only you can say my name

It's all gone
I'm so gone

You're the better me
Trying to better
You're the death of me
You weren't there for me

Only you can say my name

Call it out
