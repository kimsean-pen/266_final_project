You were wrong for trusting me
I've always been a sucker for the way you move
We're alone, just you and me
And you're always second guessing what I've been to you

Don't let this slide for anyone
I don't really wanna be that way you go
And we won't them that what we've done, now

Cause' when i'm with her
I am, thinking of you, thinking of you
Your lips and your style
And your anchor tattoo, anchor tattoo
If your boyfriend finds out, he'll kill me too
Tonight it's just me and you, no

The reminders that you left on my neck
(Keep me closer to you)
And you heart beats with every breath
(You know that i'll be back soon)

You look so cold standing on your own
Can i sleep in cause we're all alone
I've never seen you look so good, now

Cause' when i'm with her
I am, thinking of you thinking of you
Your lips and your style
And your anchor tattoo, anchor tattoo
If your boyfriend finds out, he'll kill me too
Tonight it's just me and you, no

Thinking of you, thinking of you
Anchor tattoo, anchor tattoo
Thinking of you, thinking of you
And your anchor tattoo, anchor tattoo

Cause' when i'm with her
I am, thinking of you thinking of you
Your lips and your style
And your anchor tattoo, anchor tattoo
If your boyfriend finds out, he'll kill me too
Tonight it's just me and you, no

Thinking of you, thinking of you
And your anchor tattoo, anchor tattoo.
