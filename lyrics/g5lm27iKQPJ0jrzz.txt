Don't know what happened
But somebody lost their mind tonight
Not sure what happened
But I don't think I got home tonight
And there's blood on my shirt

The clap of thunder
And I see my life go flashing by
The smell of sulphur
And I weep as I embrace the sky
I heard somebody scream

My chest is burning
I think someone set my soul alight
Don't know what happened
But I don't think I got home tonight
I wonder why
I wonder why

Ahhhh, there's madness here today
Ahhhh, I think I'll go away

Where is my wife?
Where is my wife?
I'm draining away
I'm draining away
(Draining away)
Here today
