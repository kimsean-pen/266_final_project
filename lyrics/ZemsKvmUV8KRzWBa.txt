Hey there, let's get away
I sure need a lazy summer day
But oh dear, we've gotta stay
Finish all that we needed to say

Now darling if you fall
I'll be there to hold you
'Cause I gave you my soul
Long time ago, long time ago

'Cause you, you are my lonely star
And I'm, I'm your wishing girl
'Cause you, you are my lonely star
And I'm, I'm your wishing girl

Now hey you, clear your mind
'Cause happiness is all that I can find
But oh dear, we've gotta stay
Finish all that we needed to say

Now darling if you fall
I'll be there to hold you
'Cause I gave you my soul
Long time ago, long time ago

'Cause you, you are my lonely star
And I'm, I'm your wishing girl
'Cause you, you are my lonely star
And I'm, I'm your wishing girl
'Cause you, you are my lonely star
And I'm, I'm your wishing girl
