We've been through days of thunder
Some people say they don't belong
They try to put us under

But here we stand together and a million strong?
Let's get on with the show (Let's get started)
Turn the lights down low (Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start (You were there)
We know who you are
And this one goes out to you
Everyone, everyone, everyone
Said this one goes out to you
Everyone, we're standing strong cause of what you've done
And this one goes out to you.
We've been inside the circus (circus music plays a bit)
We take the pleasure with the pain
I guess there's something about us
Whatever comes around we'll always stay the same
Oh yeah
Let's get on with the show (Oh Let's get started)

Turn the lights down low (Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start (You were there)
We know who you are
We know, who you are!
Everyone, everyone, everyone
Said this one goes out to you
Everyone, we're standing strong cause of what you've done
And this one goes out to you.

Now we're minutes away
Till it's time to play
Our heart beats are rising
They're letting you in
Time for the show to begin
We, we're standing stong cuz of what you've done
This one goes out to you you you
You make us feel like we've just begun
And this one goes out to you

Everyone, everyone, everyone
Said this one goes out to
Everyone, we're standing strong cause of what you've done

And this one goes out to you.
Everyone, everyone, everyone(yeah)
Said this one goes out to
Everyone, we're standing strong cause of what you've done
And this one goes out to you
