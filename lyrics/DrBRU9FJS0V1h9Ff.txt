Out she's later in the distance, shouting out a warn
Out she ran too persistent, whoa, our mind is so absurd
Whoa love, whoa love
Jumping jolly to the end, I wanna be your friend
I wanna be your best friend,
I don't want you to be my girl
I wanna be your friend
I don't want you to be my
I don't want you to be my

Well well, I see when it's windy
Sure â€¦ be on boots
I'll match, always ready
To take that line and finally shoot
Whoa love, whoa love
Jumping jolly to the end, I wanna be your friend
I wanna be your best friend,
I don't want you to be my girl
I wanna be your best friend
I don't want you to be my
I don't want you to be my

I wanna be your best friend
I don't want you to be my girl
I wanna be your best friend
I don't want you to be my
I don't want you to be my
