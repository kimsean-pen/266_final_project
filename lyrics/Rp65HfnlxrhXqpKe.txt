I am the last
The one who holds on past
Clinging on something we used to have
I am the last
The one who chose this path
To walk among the world of shadows
Always one for sorrow
Never one for love
Two souls destined to failure
Right from the start
It was always one for sorrow
Never one for love
Two souls set for departure
Before the nightfall
And here I stand
Devoid of faith, bereft of hope
Unable to break the walls around me
And here I stand
Shell of a man from past
Condemned to world of resentment
It took two to summon the thunder
One to bring down the rain
Two to torn all asunder
One to suffer the pain
Two to crush dreams and wonders
One to lose everything
All once beautiful and sacred
Nothing but in vain
