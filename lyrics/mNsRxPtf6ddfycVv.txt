Tell me now, tell me now you got what you wanted
Tell me now you're where you want to be
Tell me now, tell me now your new love's easy
Tell me now that it still makes you free

Some things wake you in the morning
Some things make you want to die
And baby nothing lasts forever, even if you want it
In this time

Tell me now, tell me now why you're still chasing
Tell me now, tell me now whats your gain
Tell me now why everybody has to love you?
Tell me now why nothing stays the same?

Some things wake you in the morning
Some things make you want to die
And maybe nothing lasts forever, even if you want it
In this time

Some things wake you in the morning
Now they make you want to die
And baby nothing lasts forever, even if you want it
Baby nothing lasts forever, even if you want it

My baby nothing lasts forever, even if you want it
In this time
In this time
