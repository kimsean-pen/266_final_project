Hey, Missus, see, please don't jump
"Why not? Nothing is making sense any more to me
I don't know when I stopped making him smile
Now the kids see me cry all the time"

From one mother to the other
They'll never get over this
For their lifetime all their wishes
Will be dashed upon those cliffs

So let's be strong, you and me
The night is o- opening
Our angels are falling
And they will warm, they'll warm us

She asked, "Right now? Right here?"
I'm feeling soon, soon, my dear
Maybe Cali- California
Maybe Cali- Califor- oh California

As mothers we have our troubles
You'll leave them with emptiness
For their lifetime all their wishes
Will be dashed upon those cliffs, those cliffs

So let's be strong, you and me
The night is o- it is opening
Our angels are falling
And they will warm, and they will warm us

She asked, "Right now? Right here?"
I'm feeling soon, so soon, my dear
Maybe Cali- California
Maybe Cali- Califor- oh California

Until then there will be
Starlight shining down
For every tear in every town
