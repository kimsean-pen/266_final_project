You can't keep a grown woman waiting
Boy you can't be wasting her time
It's only silly girls that will run game
With a woman boy you cant cross the line
It's easy if we both want the same thing
Or even maybe try compromise

Bridge:
Tell me what you want
Is this what you want
Let me know 'cause if it's not
Then I'm not the one
I'll be happy on my own

Chorus:
I don't know why
But boy you're not eazy
The more that I try you take the p
So now I know I got no choice but to leave
And tell you goodbye

Just so you know I don't do chasing
Sweetie you know I don't do lies
Baby I'm too cute for time wasting
You know that I can't read your mind
Gotta let me know what your sayin
I'm not really the guessing kind

Bridge:
Tell me what you want.

Chorus

M8...
Boy you're not eazy
Said you should be pleasing me
Don't you know I'll find
Someone else more my kind
I'm too cute for your crap
No way I'm takin that
Have you got no time for this guy?
Might as well say goodbye oh!

Bridge
Tell me what you want
Is this what you want
Let me know 'cause if it's not then I'm not the one
I'll be happy on my own

Chorus
