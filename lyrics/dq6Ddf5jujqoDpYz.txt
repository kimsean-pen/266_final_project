Still can't decide whether I wanna
Waste money or waste my time
I'll probably stay inside
Never really been the social type
And I'll still try to stand tall
No, that's not me in the back row no more
So I'm not gonna walk like I'm in your shadow anymore

I'll keep growing my hair out
I never wanna do anything, even when you're around
I'll keep growing my hair out
It's not for you, oh no

And tonight, I'll probably eat by myself
I'll probably do nothing else
Sit like a book upon a shelf

Maybe I haven't learned anything
Maybe I haven't learned anything
Maybe I'm destined to stay
Maybe I'm destined to never change

But I'll keep growing my hair out
I never wanna do anything, even when you're around
I'll keep growing my hair out
It's not for you
Oh no, it's not for you
No, it's not for you

I never wanna do anything
Maybe I haven't learned anything
I loved you more than anything
I never wanna do anything
Maybe I haven't learned anything
I loved you more than anything
I never wanna do anything
Maybe I haven't learned anything

But I'll keep growing my hair out
I never wanna do anything, even when you're around
I'll keep growing my hair out
It's not for you
Oh no, it's not for you
No, it's not for you
