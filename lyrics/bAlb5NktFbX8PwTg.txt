Shut my eyes
I don't wanna be
Privy to the look you're giving me
When I tell you that I'm never gonna be
The way you said I would

Shut my mouth
I don't wanna say
Words that'll make you go away
But I also wanna make you go away
For good

I don't like it
Any more than you do
I don't like being the bad guy
And breaking the bad news
'Cause I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't say
Life was better before we were together
Straight to your face
'Cause I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't say
Life was better before
Oh, we were together

And I'm gonna be
But I don't wanna be
The woman that goes in history
For leaving you for being too good

No, I don't wanna sit
In the dark goin' over it
Or maybe we could laugh it out
But what is there to joke about?

I don't like it
Any more than you do
I don't like being the bad guy
And breaking the bad news
'Cause I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't say
Life was better before we were together
Straight to your face
'Cause I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't say
Life was better before we were together
Life was better before we were together
Oh, Life was better before, oh we were together

I don't like it
Any more than you do
I don't like being the bad guy
Breaking the bad news
'Cause I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't say
Life was better before we were together
Straight to your face
Oh, I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't say
Life was better before we were together
Life was better before we were together
Oh, Life was better before we were together
Oh, Life was better before, oh we were together
