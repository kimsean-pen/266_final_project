I don't even need a reason
Bet you're feeling all alone
And this' the way they go, oh
I don't even need a reason
Telling me that I should go
I'm just walking blind on my own

I should be holding it down
You got everything I need
Except for a purpose
Often it's worse and
Don't know what I felt
Till it's fading behind
Holding it down, holding you down

I only want you when I let you go
I only want you when I let you go
I only want you when I let you go
It turns to water when I try to hold it

I can't get the satisfaction
Nothing seems to set me free
So darling where you're going?
No I can't get the satisfaction
Everything is calling me
To get my kicks on the wall

I should be holding it down
You got everything I need
Except for a purpose
Often it's worse and
Don't know what I felt
Till it's fading behind
Holding it down, holding you down

I only want you when I let you go
I only want you when I let you go
I only want you when I let you go
It turns to water when I try to hold it
