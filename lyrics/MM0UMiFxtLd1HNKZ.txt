Alright!
Haaa ha ha ha!

You say, I cannot get there from here, baby
Then I don't care where I'm goin'
Here's to your thin red line
Mmm, I'm stepping over

Thought you'd never miss me 'til I got a fat city address
Non-stop talker, what a rocker
Blue-eyed murder in a size five dress

Change, nothin' stays the same
Unchained, and ya hit the ground runnin'
Change, ain't nothin' stays the same
Unchained, yeah ya hit the ground runnin'

I know, I don't ask for permission
This is my chance to fly
Maybe enough ain't enough for you
But it's my turn at a try

Thought you'd never miss me 'til I got a fat city address
Non-stop talker, what a rocker
Blue-eyed murder in a size five dress

Change, nothin' stays the same
Unchained, and ya hit the ground running
Change, ain't nothin' stays the same
Unchained, yeah ya hit the ground runnin'

Change, nothin' stays the same
Unchained, yeah ya hit the ground runnin'
Change, ain't nothin' stays the same
Unchained, yeah ya hit the ground runnin'

Woo hoo! Take a look at this!
Hey man, that suit is you!
Woo-whee! You'll get some leg tonight for sure!
Tell us how you do! Hoo hoo hoo!
(Come on Dave, gimme a break)
Hey hey hey hey! One break, comin' up!
Change, ain't nothin' stays the same
Unchained, yeah ya hit the ground runnin'
Changed, ain't nothin' stays the same
Unchained, yeah ya hit the ground runnin'
Change, ain't nothin' stays the same
Unchained, yeah ya hit the ground runnin'
Change, ain't nothin' stays the same
Unchained
