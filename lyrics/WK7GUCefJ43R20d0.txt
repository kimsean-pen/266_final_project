From the shadows inside of me
To the light that shines in me
I will be, like an arrow

And the fire that lights the night
And these shadows within the light
I will be, like an arrow

This heart of a cold white land
In the dark of the endless nights
And the light of summer that never dies
In these songs from the North

From the cradle of the ice
To the tomb of the night
I will sleep in your arms

And the beauty of the eye
An horizon, guiding light
I will keep in my heart

These skies of the winter stars
Arise to the frozen night
And the light of summer that never dies
In these songs from the North
In these songs from the North

Sky, earth, stars
Lakes, moon, trees

These skies of the winter stars
Arise to the frozen night
And the light of summer that never dies
In these songs from the North
In these songs from the North
