When we get down
The beat that plays
Runs this town
Every night 'n' day
When we get down
The feelin' stays
It's all around
Bringin' us face to face

I'm gon'
I'm gonna getcha, baby, oh
I'm gon'
I'm gonna getcha, baby

And I'll never let you go-oh
'Cause you got that neon
Glow-ow oh oh, yeah
Got your love in stereo-oh
So tonight you know we're
Gonna push the tempo
Baby, I got you

Baby, I got you
Baby, I got you

The metronome
Your heart obeys
Always on
Every night 'n' day
And in the zone
There's no escape
Like Thunderdome
You can't Tina-Turn it away

I'm gon'
I'm gonna getcha, baby, oh
I'm gon'
I'm gonna getcha, baby

And I'll never let you go-oh
'Cause you got that neon
Glow-ow oh oh, yeah
Got your love in stereo-oh
So tonight you know we're
Gonna push the tempo
Baby, I got you

Baby, I got you
Baby, I got you

I'm gon'
I'm gonna getcha, baby, oh
I'm gon'
I'm gonna getcha, baby
I'm gon'
I'm gonna getcha, baby, oh
I'm gon'
I'm gonna getcha, baby

And I'll never let you go-oh
'Cause you got that neon
Glow-ow oh oh, yeah
Got your love in stereo-oh
So tonight you know we're
Gonna push the tempo
Baby, I got you
