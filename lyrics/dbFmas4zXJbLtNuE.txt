I, I, I come up hard, baby, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it sugar, playin' by the rules
I come up hard, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble, sugar, movin' down the line
I come up hard, baby, that's ok
Cause trouble man don't get in my way

I come up hard, baby
I've been for real, baby
Gonna keep movin', gonna roll to town
I come up hard, I come on, get down
There's only three things that's for sure
Taxes, death and trouble, oh

This I know, sugar
Yeah, I ain't never let it sweat you, baby

Got me singin' yeah, yeah

Took care of my business with all my might
I come up hard, I had to win
Then start all over and win again
I come up hard, but that's ok
Cause trouble man don't get in my way

Hey, hey

I got good connections I dig my directions
What people say that's ok they don't bother me

Don't care 'bout no trouble got myself together
I feel the kind of protection that's all around

I come up hard, baby

There's only three things for sure
Taxes, death and trouble
