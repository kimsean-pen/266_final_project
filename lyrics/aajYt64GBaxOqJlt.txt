Don't tell the gods I left a mess
I can't undo what has been done
Let's run for cover
What if I'm the only hero left
You better fire off your gun
Once and forever

He said "go dry your eyes
And live your life like there is no tomorrow son
And tell the others
To go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard"

We are the heroes of our time
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
We are the heroes of our time
Heroes
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
Heroes

We are the heroes of our time
Heroes
But were dancing with the demons in our minds
Heroes

The crickets sing a song for you
Don't say a word don't make a sound
It's life's creation
I make worms turn into butterflies
Wake up and turn this world around
In appreciation

He said "I never left your side
When you were lost I followed right behind
Was your foundation
Now go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard"
Now sing together

We are the heroes of our time
Heroes
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
Heroes

We are the heroes
(We keep dancing with the demons, you could be a hero)

Now go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard
Now sing together

We are the heroes of our time
Heroes
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
Heroes
We are the heroes of our time
(We keep dancing with the demons, you could be a hero) Heroes
But were dancing with the demons in our minds
(We keep dancing with the demons, you could be a hero) Heroes
We are the heroes
