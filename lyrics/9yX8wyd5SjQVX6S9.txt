I found no humor in your laughter
it stole my breath and took real effort
to get out of my head and out my lungs

I love you so hard it hurts me sometimes

I'm looking back on all of these old notifications
but what to they say about me
what do they say about me now

I'm sorry that I'm not exactly what you expected from me
expected from me

I'm usually not this bad at saying that I'm sorry
but I'm not sorry even though you think that I should be
that I should be
