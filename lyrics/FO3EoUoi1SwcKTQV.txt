No, I don't believe in luck
No, I don't believe in circumstance, no more
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
So I won't believe in luck

I saw you walking in the dark
So I slipped behind your footsteps for a while
Caught you turning around the block
Fancy meeting in a smaller world

After all, accidents never happen
I could have planned it all
Precognition in my ears
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
Complications disappear

Now you love me
I, oh I can tell
I never lied
I never cried
And you, you knew so well

Like the Magi on the hill
I can divinate your presence from afar
And I'll follow you until
I can bring you to my perfect world
I'll do

Accidents never happen
I could have planned it all
Precognition in my ears
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
Complications disappear

Oh I can tell
I never lied
I never cried
And you, you knew so well

Accidents never happen in a perfect world
Accidents never happen
