i know you know my heads not in this now
nothing you could keep so keep me down
like the stones beneath the water that you walk on to be taller
the hands you stuck together cause you prayed you'd wait forever
just another fragile angel heart
falling down on lead wings torn apart

and the words beneath my skin
the ink that you put in
destroying all the things you left around
cause your earthbound coming down

so what you have the nerve to call a friend
is starved of all the sense to make amends
cause i'm the glass you break to touch but you never want me much
like the view across the water from your shoes and two feet smaller
i know it doesn't pay to be this hurt
falling off the morning getting worse

and the words beneath my skin
the ink that you put in
destroying all the things you've left around
cause i'm earthbound coming down
come down
come down
come around...

cause i'm down
