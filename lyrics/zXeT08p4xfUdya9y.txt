Tears fall in slivers, you broke my shades
The light too bright, let me bury my heart
Filter emotions of green, cowardicee gives blue
A restricted view, let me open my heart

I have a fleeting love
Searching when it lands
Fragile, needing precious hands
Fragile

You eat my energy, give me more rope
Nail in the wall, let me hang my heart

I have a fleeting love
Searching when it lands
Fragile, needing precious hands
Fragile
