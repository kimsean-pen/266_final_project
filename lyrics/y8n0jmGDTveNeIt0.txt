I've got a bad disease
Up from my brain is where I bleed
Insanity it seems
Has got me by my soul to squeeze

Well all the love from thee
With all the dying trees I scream
The angels in my dreams yeah
Have turned to demons of greed that's me

Where I go I just don't know
I got to got to gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Today love smiled on me
It took away my pain, said please
I'll let your ride be free
You gotta let it be oh yeah

Where I go I just don't know
I got to got to gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Oh, so polite indeed
Well I got everything I need
Oh make my days a breeze
And take away my self destruction

It's bitter baby,
And it's very sweet
I'm on a rollercoaster,
but I'm on my feet
Take me to the river,
Lay me on your shore
'Cause I'll be coming back baby,
I'll be coming back for more

Diddle doddle ding a zing a zong zong a zing
a zoma zoma zoma con don bing
I could not forget
But I will not endeavor
Simple pleasures are more special
But I wont regret it never

Where I go I just don't know
I got to got to gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time
Where I go I just don't know
I might end up somewhere in Mexico
When I find my piece of mind
I'm gonna keep you for the end of time
