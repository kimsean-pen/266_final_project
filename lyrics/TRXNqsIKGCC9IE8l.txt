and i was just another
west coast maximalist
exploring the blues
ignoring the news
from the front

where they're taking her
children away
taking them where they wanna go
tall ships made of snow
invading the sun

some people call me 'angel'
on their death bed in a dream
that's right
the Czars father thought
things could've gone differently last night
but they didn't

and i couldn't bear
to follow you there
where trauma exists in the sky
20th century masters
welcome these disasters
and so do i. but no!
oh baby please don't go
up into it.
