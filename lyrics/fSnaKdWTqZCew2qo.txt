I can change your life in a single night
I can make you hungry, get an appetite
I could tell a story that would make you cry
But nobody ever seems to bat an eye

'Cause this town's too small for a girl like me
For a girl like me, for a girl like me
It feels like I'm a walking tragedy
Walking tragedy, walking tragedy

But do you ever wonder about the kid wonder?
If only you knew it was me
I'm the kid wonder
And do you ever wonder about the kid wonder?
If only you knew it was me
I'm the kid wonder

I give you a ticket to the midnight show
We can hit the road and we can go, go, go
Turn our faces in and you can kiss me slow
I can turn around and say I told you so

'Cause this town's too small for a girl like me
For a girl like me, for a girl like me
It feels like I'm a walking tragedy
Walking tragedy, walking tragedy

But do you ever wonder about the kid wonder?
If only you knew it was me
I'm the kid wonder
And do you ever wonder about the kid wonder?
If only you knew it was me
I'm the kid wonder

I'm the kid wonder
I'm the kid wonder
I'm the kid wonder
I'm the kid wonder
