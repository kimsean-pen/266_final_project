Do that, do that
Do that, do that

Heard you got a tough life
Yeah, someone loves you but you don't love 'em back
Oh, what a fucked life
Waiting to reciprocate but you never act

You don't do that (No)
Give someone else the Oscar
You won't lie like a coward

But it's so damn hard
When he's staring in your eyes saying
"Baby, you got some super powers"
Yeah, he's staring in my eyes saying
"Baby, you got some super powers
Baby, you got some super powers
Baby, you got some sup-"

No explanation
I thought I saw you one night
I'm such a freak with my feelings
So there's condensation
We're soaking wet in love
I won't ignore the sensation, nah

We don't do that (Do that, do that)
Give someone else the Oscar
I won't die like a coward

But it's so damn hard
When you're staring in my eyes, saying
"Baby, you got some super powers"
Yeah, she's staring in my eyes, saying
"Baby, you got some super powers"
"Baby, you got some super powers"
"Baby, you got some super powers"

Do that, do that
