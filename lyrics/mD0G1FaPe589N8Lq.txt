Been sinking in you too many times
You won't say any sign
You will get yours but I don't get mine
So what I would do to be with you
You will never know, do whatever y'all say so
'Til about a quarter of my life has almost passed
Even shorter if you mightn't be making it last
When I was on the back seats saying

Don't know how I feel about you
Got my hopes sunk and I keep on fantasising and I
Know it's just a feel about you
Got my hopes sunk and I keep on fantasising and I

I just wanna be about you
Just to be about you
Don't know how I feel about you
Just to feel it there

I see the way your daughter live and it's like an inkling
It's the kind of thing that make you sort of think
And I just wanna be with you
[?] I got the better view
When I should be doing mine I end up
Do a quarter of my life has almost passed
Even shorter if you mightn't be making it last
When I was on the back seats saying

Don't know how I feel about you
Got my hopes sunk and I keep on fantasising and I
Know it's just a feel about you
Got my hopes sunk and I keep on fantasising and I

I just wanna be about you
Just to be about you
Don't know how I feel about you
Just to feel it there

Don't know how I feel about you
Got my hopes sunk and I keep on fantasising and I
Know it's just a feel about you
Got my hopes sunk and I keep on fantasising and I

I just wanna be about you
Just to be about you
Don't know how I feel about you
Just to feel it there
