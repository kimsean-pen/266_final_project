It's been a long cold winter, without you.
I've been crying on the inside, over you.
you just slipped through my fingers as life turned away.
it's been a long cold winter since that day.

and it's hard to find
hard to find
hard to find the strength now but I try.
and I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna go on and speak now
of what's gone by.
cause no matter what I say no matter what I do
I can't change what happened I can't change what happened.
no matter what I say no matter what I do
I can't change what happened.
no matter what I say no matter what I do
I can't cahange what happened.
no no you can't change us.
you just slipped through my fingers
and I feel so ashamed.
you just slipped through my fingers
and I've paid.

'cause no matter what I say no matter what I do
I can't change what happened I can't change what happened.
no matter what I say no matter what I do
I can't change what happened I can't change what happened.
no matter what I say no matter what I do
I can't change what happened I can't change what happened.
no no you can't change us.
slipped through my fingers and I feel so ashamed.
you just slipped through my fingers and I've paid.
