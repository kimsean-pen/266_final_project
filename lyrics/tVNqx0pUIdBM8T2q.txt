On the tip of my tongue
An offensive is poised and rearing
My intention: A bullet
My body: A trigger finger

Yeah my pen is a pistola
Let go of your fear, fear yeah
Yeah my pen is a pistola

My secret arsenal
Is an infinite, ageless inkwell
It's a fountain of youth
And a patriot's weapon of choice

Yeah my pen is a pistola
Let go of your fear, fear yeah
Yeah my pen is a pistola

On the tip of my tongue
An offensive is poised and rearing
My intention: A bullet
My body: A trigger finger

Yeah my pen is a pistola
Let go of your fear
Yeah my pen is a pistola
