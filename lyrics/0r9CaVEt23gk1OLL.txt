A ghost by any other name, she's just a frozen satellite
So close her mouth and kiss with her eyes
Rose just goes insane, she smokes a frozen dandelion
Goes by the sound, she speaks her mind

If we were just strangers then we would fall in love again
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty
And now, I can see why everyone has will to be
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty

A ghost that creeps around the crystal surface on your brow
The light show's [?] inside
A rose bloom can't hide [?] frozen underground
She's a ghost that smells like a rose

If we were just strangers then we would fall in love again
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty
And now, I can see why everyone has will to be
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty

If we were just strangers then we would fall in love again
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty
And now, I can see why everyone has will to be
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty

If we were just strangers then we would fall in love again
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty
And now, I can see why everyone has will to be
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty
