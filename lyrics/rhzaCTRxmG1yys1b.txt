Could there be another universe?
One that wasn't always out to getcha?
And it breaks my heart a little bit
That you're like a sleepwalker
Half alive and hanging by a thread

I'm not dead yet
I'm not dead yet, no
I'm bent but not broken
And I'm not dead yet, no
Yeah

Maybe there's a whole middle reverse
Spoken and it holds me out forever
And it breaks my heart a little bit
But love is like a blind doctor
Tryin' to shoot an apple off my head

I'm not dead yet
I'm not dead yet, no
I'm bent but not broken
And I'm not dead yet
Not yet

We're undefeated, bent but not broken
No they ain't seen nothing yet
We're undefeated, bent but not broken
Not dead yet
We're undefeated, bent but not broken
No they ain't seen nothing yet
We're undefeated, bent but not broken

I'm not dead yet
I'm not dead yet, no
I'm bent but not broken
And I'm not dead yet (ooh)

I'm not dead yet (ooh)
I'm not dead yet (ooh)
I'm bent but not broken (ooh)
And I'm not dead yet (ooh)
No
