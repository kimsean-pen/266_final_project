Take away, these hands of darkness.
Reaching for my soul.
Now, the cold wind blows out my candles.
Feeling, only fear, without any hope.

A thousand dark moons.
A thousand winters long.
A million fallen stars
The candle burns in the womb

We trie not to forget, they live through us.
Slowly they die away at every candle's end

A thousand dark moons,
A thousand winters long.
A million fallen star
The candle burns in the womb.

We trie not to forget,
They live through us
Slowly they die away at every candle's end.
