Your light has gone out
And my mouth has shut
And the glow surrounding your body has faded

We're living in hell
And cutting our hair
You have your ways and I have mine

When the time comes
I'll know what to do
I know what picture I want them to use

But your light has gone out
And mine still glows
And it keeps you up all night

I know you resent me
Just like I envy you
