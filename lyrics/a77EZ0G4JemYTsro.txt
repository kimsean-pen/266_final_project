and I don't care how high you are

two hands they take me by surprise
I'm gripping on to where I think I should arrive
we lay so vacant in the dark
take me now so I can wake up, and drift away
and I don't care how high you are
open your mind, inhale the dark
and I don't care how high you are
don't wake me up til we arrive

and I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
and I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
and I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
and I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
and I don't car how high you are
open your mind, inhale the dark
and I don't care how high you are
don't wake me up til we arrive
