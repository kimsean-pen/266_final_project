And maybe if I open my arms wide enough,
I, take flight
Oh, and close my eyes for long enough,
I will see
And maybe if I wait,
The wind will blow me forwards
Oh, and teach these little lungs,
How to breathe
And maybe if I build myself a barrier,
It'd force someone to try and tear it down
And maybe if I dream enough the impossible would happen
Oh, and live so long,
The world stops spinning round
Just know I'm happy as I am,
I'm happy as I am,
And it's Thanks To You
And it's Thanks To You
Well maybe I pull myself down
I've been praying for bails, and never served
I've been following your light,
Well I had never sawn, no
You gotta, pick me up,
And tell me where I been goin wrong
Well, pick me up
And tell me where I've been goin wrong
And you said we're all just skin and bones
Just skin and bones
Just skin and bone
Were scattered in the wind
We'll end up where
We're supposed to be
And it's Thanks To You
That I am here
And you're here too
The entire world seems brand new
And it's Thanks To You
And it's Thanks To You
Oh,
It's Thanks To You
