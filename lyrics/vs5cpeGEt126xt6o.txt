Ha! Ha! Haaah, haaah!
wrapping in my arms
Do I alone notice?
The drip!
Sacrifice despite all the bruises
I want you
Do you feel?
Did I from me?
You come part easily
Youre a drip
Full of life
And I will have you fro my hand
Wanting between us together
And feels divine cause I
Better should with you up
Feelings apart
If there is a God
