My sheets are cold of lighters too
I can't remember last night, but my memory is only of you
I drink, but I can't even taste anymore
I taste the blood in my mouth, it tastes of you
Red jeans, bit nails, your eyelids blue
Smoke pot in the back of the Disco with nothing to do
I reach, I fall, I touch my face to the floor
Lips taste swell, in the bathroom I'll wait for you
And after dark she asked me if I knew
I told her the truth, I told her I still love you
I called her up, she asked me to not call anymore
I hang up the phone, I'm always a lover than you
Not to pass, but I'll always be in love with you
