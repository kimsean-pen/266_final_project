Are you falling through?
Are you falling through?
Don't let it leak out now
You've got to make it through
The photos in your hands
In your fox holed youth
It's not different now
Then it'll ever be
You've got to trust me
You've got to trust me

Don't you worry 'bout us losing everyone
Cousin Rachel and we'll go out on a pond
We'll get stuck in the middle of it all with an old pontoon
I don't think I have enough batteries
Tell my dad that I died

It won't be long
Till we'll all go back
To our open locks
And our biggest cities
To our open locks
And our biggest cities

It won't be long
Till we'll all go back
To our open locks
And our biggest cities
To our open locks
And our biggest cities
(It won't be long)
