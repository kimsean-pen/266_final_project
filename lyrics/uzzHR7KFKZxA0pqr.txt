Ow, uh

Midnight gettin' uptight where are you
You said you'd meet me now it's quarter to two
I know I'm hangin' but I'm still wantin' you

Hey Jack it's a fact they're talkin' in town
I turn my back and you're messin' around
I'm not getting jealous don't I like lookin' like a clown

I think of you every night and day
You took my heart then you took my pride away

I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Ow, uh

Daylight spent the night without you
But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do
I'm over being angry 'bout the hell you put me through

Hey man bet you can't treat me right
You just don't know what you was missin' last night
I wanna see you beggin' say forget it just for spite

I think of you every night and day
You took my heart then you took my pride away

I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Ow, uh

I think of you every night and day
You took my heart then you took my pride away

I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you

I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you

I hate myself ow, uh
For loving you
I hate myself ow, uh
For loving you
I hate myself ow, ow, ow
For loving you
I hate myself ow
I hate myself
For loving you
