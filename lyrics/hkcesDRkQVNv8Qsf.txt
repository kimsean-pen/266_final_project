New year's resolution to write something of value
New year's resolution to write something would be fine
All I ever wanted was someone to rely on
All I ever wanted was somewhere to call home
You offer a friendship I can not reciprocate
So don't beg me, in a garden, for it not to end this way

I've been cool with you
I've been cool with you
I've been cool with you
The sooner you admit it I will too

New year's resolution to kiss you like I mean it
With cheeks the colour of Rhubarb we'll be fine
Everybody's rushing around like they got a meeting
I just want to be here with a friend of mine
We decided to brave the elements of Spain
Because The Seven Year Itch was on telly again

I've been cool with you
I've been cool with you
I've been cool with you
The sooner you admit it I will too

I decided this pain was a landscape of blame
I decided to be only myself these days

I've been cool with you
I've been cool with you
I've been cool with you
The sooner you admit it I will too

Stay now
I wish that you would stay now
Stay now
You nearly went away now

Stay now
I wish that you would stay now
I wish you would stay now
You nearly went away now

Stay now
You nearly went away
Stay now
I wish you would stay now
