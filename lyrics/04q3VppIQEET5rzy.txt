Badlees, The
The Unfortunate Result Of Spare Time
The Unfunny
Just be clever for clever's sake, starin' at the ceiling into shadow-fakes
The circle-smokes in the ladies room only got you as far as the roles assumed
A glimpse of the perfect crime is just a reverie away
Whadaya say we hang there a while for expediency's sake?

And fantasize the great demise of the unfunny
Cut and dry, we'll bid good-bye to the unfunny

Their personality inspires like a five pound bag of fertilizer
Like living in a house with fifteen cats, you're unaware of the stench when a line goes flat
A glimpse of the perfect crime is just a reverie away
Whadaya say we hang there a while for expediency's sake?

And fantasize the great demise of the unfunny
Set 'em up, we'll drink a cup to the unfunny
