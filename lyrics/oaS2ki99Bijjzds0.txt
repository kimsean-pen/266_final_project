Morning light, shined down upon
Shoulder blades, my mistakes
Oh I don't know, just what to do
To be in love, with anyone but you

Break it fast, old time
Give me one way side
I'll be alright

Find it in, the subtle pores
The breathing wind, I'm broken heart
And maybe if, we'll never do
To stir away, with anyone but you

Break it fast, old time
Grief be on my side
I'll be alright
I'll be alright

Break it fast, old time
Grief be on my side
I'll be alright
