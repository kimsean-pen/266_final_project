Sell my fucking soul
With little to no reward
I'm plagued to be given less
Always expecting more
Contemplated stepping off the edge
Left hanging by a thread
Unraveling to my end

Shut my eyes from the mess I'm in
Pull me out from the wreckage
I won't go out quietly
Won't go out and fade to nothing
Shut my eyes from the mess I'm in
Pull me out from the wreckage
I won't go out quietly
Won't go out and fade to nothing

Fade to nothing

Buried my dreams
It gave new life to the world around me
Surrendered hope when I was empty
So I feel your pain if you gave what you had
And never got it back

Shut my eyes from the mess I'm in
Pull me out from the wreckage
I won't go out quietly
Won't go out and fade to nothing
Shut my eyes from the mess I'm in
Pull me out from the wreckage
I won't go out quietly
Won't go out and fade to nothing

And when my time is up
Did I give enough?
Don't wanna be replaced
I won't be erased
And when my time is up
Hope I gave enough
Don't wanna be replaced
I won't be erased

Shut my eyes from the mess I'm in
Pull me out from the wreckage
I won't go out quietly
Won't go out and fade to nothing
Shut my eyes from the mess I'm in
Pull me out from the wreckage
I won't go out quietly
Won't go out and fade to nothing
