Harlots of Hell, spread your wings, as I penetrate your soul
Feel the fire shoot through your body, as I slip into your throne
Cast aside, do as you will, I care not how you plead
Satan's child now stalks the Earth, born from my demon seed

Hot wings of Hell burns in my wake
Death is what you pray
Behold captor of sin

Infernal slaves of manipulation captive of my vice
Abandon God, the helpless One, to relieve you of your plight
Subversive action will not help, it will strengthen me
I see decline in your every move, death, your final plea

Hot wings of Hell burns in my wake
Death is what you pray
Behold captor of sin

Your skin turns to leather, I ignite your timid blood
You feel my lethal touch as I grasp your weary soul
I'll take you down into the fire

Harlots of Hell, spread your wings, as I penetrate your soul
Feel the fire shoot through your body, as I slip into your throne
Cast aside, do as you will, I care not how you plead
Satan's child now stalks the Earth, born from my demon seed

Hot wings of Hell burns in my wake
Death is what you pray
Behold captor of sin
