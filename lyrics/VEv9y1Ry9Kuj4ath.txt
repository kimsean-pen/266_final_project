It's too late to save my sanity
You can't expect me to change
It's too late to save my sanity
Some things just won't be the same

I don't wanna hurt, I wanna hide
Fall through the floor in the dirt
Spend some time, uh
By myself inside the Earth
Like what's worse?
Think the burns would hurt
Less than missing her 'cause
I'm just a backwoods boy
Need a break, let me breathe
I'm sick of big city noise
Putting words in my mouth
Reading things online
Think you got me figured out

Change up, I will never change up
White tea in my cup, I been on the same stuff
Wake up, I can never wake up
Stay in bed, skip alarms
Started feeling so stuck

It's too late to save my sanity
You can't expect me to change
It's too late to save my sanity
Some things just won't be the same

Got too many problems of my own now
And if I don't address them I'mma blow now
You know that I'm a mess and I can't slow down
Feel it in my chest, nowhere to go now
Let me be
They won't let me breathe
I can never be
Someone else's remedy

Change up, I will never change up
White tea in my cup, I been on the same stuff
Wake up, I can never wake up
Stay in bed, skip alarms
Started feeling so stuck

It's too late to save my sanity
You can't expect me to change
It's too late to save my sanity
Some things just won't be the same

Small heroes
Me? I'll never change up
Who told you that? Me?
I will never change up.
Not now, not never.
Aw, shit!
