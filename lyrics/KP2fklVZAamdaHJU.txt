I've got a bag of dutch
And I'm not up to much
If you want you could come and swing by
Still get the hand on the clutch
Not quite a man of such
But one day I'll take you for a drive

I think I feel too much
I think I think too much
And darling that's no way to survive
But I've got a bag of dutch
And if you're not up to much
Maybe you could swing on by

You let me go right over my own head
Without you I know I'm better off dead
And oh lord if you think
I'll get in her head myself
Oh, darling, I'm so fucking glad
I brought the hand that I was dealt

I bought a bag of dutch
And if you're not up to much
Maybe you could swing on by
'Cause I got this old tube
Going round to my doom
And I wouldn't mind seeing those eyes
