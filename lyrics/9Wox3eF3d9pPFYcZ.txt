standing in front of you
they fade into the wall
and leave behind nothing
nothing at all

I know I don't understand how they forget
how some will just pass us by
and take what they can get
I know I don't understand how weightless they must be
without feeling
without feeling
without feeling

grasping with my fingernails
as they tear through your skin
leaving no signs of pain
no wounds to mend

I know I don't understand how they forget
how some will just pass us by
and take whay they can get
I know I don't understand how weightless they must be
without feeling
without feeling
without feeling

I know I don't understand how they forget
how some will just pass us by
and take whay they can get
I know I don't understand how weightless they must be
without feeling
without feeling
