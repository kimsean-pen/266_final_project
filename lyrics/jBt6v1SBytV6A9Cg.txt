Hit dirt, shake tree, split sky, part sea
Strip smile, lose cool
Bleed the day and break the rule
Live win, dare fail
Eat the dirt and bite the nail

Then make me miss you
Then make me miss you

So wash your face away with dirt
It don't feel good until it hurts
So take this world and shake it
Come squeeze and suck the day
Come carpe diem baby

Draw lead, piss wine, sink teeth, all mine
Stoke fire, break neck
Suffer through this, cheat on death
Hug the curve, noose the time
Tear the map and shoot the sign

Then make me miss you
Oh yeah, then make me miss you

So wash your face away with dirt
It don't feel good until it hurts
So take this world and shake it
Come squeeze and suck the day
Come carpe diem baby yeah, suck it

Live win, dare fail, eat dirt, bite the nail
Strip smile, lose cool
Bleed the day and break the rule
Hug the curve, noose the time
Tear the map and shoot the sign

Then make me miss you
Come on, come on
Then make me miss you

So wash your face away with dirt
It don't feel good until it hurts
So take this world and shake it
Come squeeze and suck the day
Come make me miss you
Come carpe diem baby
Come carpe diem baby
