Throw it up, woo hoo
Woo hoo
Woo hoo
Yeah, yeah
Woo hoo
Yeah, yeah

You're pretty, baby, but you know that
Wish I could bring ya, across the map, yeah

I can feel it in the air that it's on tonight
I don't really care if it's wrong or right
Pedal to the metal, baby, hold me tight
Anything you want, I can get that, girl
If you're with that, girl

Everybody knows that I want ya
If you want me, baby, show me
Roll the windows down, let your hair flow
Let it all go tonight

Party people

Woo hoo, all the windows down
Woo hoo, when I'm rolling through your town
Woo hoo, saying "yeah, yeah"
Woo hoo, saying "yeah, yeah"

You drive me crazy, but you know that
Feel the breeze, girl, let's take a lap, yeah

I can feel it in the air that it's on tonight
I don't really care if it's wrong or right
Pedal to the metal, baby, hold me tight
Anything you want, I can get that, girl
If you're with that, girl

Everybody knows that I want ya
If you want me, baby, show me
Roll the windows down, let your hair flow
Let it all go tonight

Party people

Woo hoo, all the windows down
Woo hoo, when I'm rolling through your town
Woo hoo, saying "yeah, yeah"
Woo hoo, saying "yeah, yeah"

Stop

It's on tonight, it's on tonight
It's on-on-on-on-on tonight

Woo hoo, all the windows down
Woo hoo, when I'm rolling through your town
Woo hoo, saying "Yeah, yeah"
Woo hoo, saying "Yeah, yeah"

Let's go

Woo hoo, all the windows down
Woo hoo, when I'm rolling through your town
Woo hoo, saying "yeah, yeah"
Woo hoo, saying "yeah, yeah"

Woo hoo
