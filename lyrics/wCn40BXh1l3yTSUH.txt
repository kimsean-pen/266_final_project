(Words & Music by Margaret A Roche)

If you go down to Hammond
you'll never come back
In my opinion you're
on the wrong track
We'll always love you but
that's not the point

If you go with that fella
forget about us
As far as I'm concerned
that would be just
throwing yourself away
not even trying
Come on you're lying to me

Well I went down to Hammond
I did as I pleased
I ain't the only one
who's got this disease

Why don't you face the fact
you old upstart
We fall apart

You'd be okay if you'd
just stay in school
Don't be a fool

Do your eyes have an answer
to this song of mine
They say we meet again
on down the line
Where is on down the line
how far away?
Tell me I'm okay

If you go down to Hammond
you'll never come back
