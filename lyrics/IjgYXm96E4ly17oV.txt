Walking down the street from the day we met and I think of you
Even after everything, I can't forget to think of you
What am I supposed to do?
Everybody seems to look like you
Even when the memories are put to bed, I think of you

Don't know what I was doing
Say I haven't ruined all the love we had before

What am I holding on to?
I should be holding you
Thinking 'bout how I want you doing those things you do
You're all I ever need, baby, I lost you, now I see
What am I holding on to?
I should be holding you
I should be holding you
I should be holding you

Walking down the street where I broke your heart and I think of you
Holding it together 'til I fall apart when I think of you
What am I supposed to say?
Never thought that I could feel this way
Wishing you and I could have another start when I think of you

Don't know what I was doing
Say I haven't ruined all the love we had before

What am I holding on to?
I should be holding you
Thinking 'bout how I want you doing those things you do
You're all I ever need, baby, I lost you, now I see
What am I holding on to?
I should be holding you
I should be holding you
I should be holding you

Don't know what I was doing
(...run away like I knew for sure)
Say I haven't ruined (all of the love that we had before)
Don't know what I was doing
Say I haven't ruined all the love we had before

What am I holding on to?
I should be holding you
Thinking 'bout how I want you doing those things you do
You're all I ever need, baby, I lost you, now I see
What am I holding on to?
I should be holding you
I should be holding you
I should be holding you
I should be holding you
I should be holding you
