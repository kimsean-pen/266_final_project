Yeah yeah
I've been feeling,
I've been feeling hurt
I've been feeling me
I've been feeling good
I've been feeling free
On the 101 driving real slow
I've been on the
Road selling out shows
Hit 'em up from home
Wiggle up little girls
This right here my night my world

I've been getting mines,
Everything on sight
I sway to the left, she sway to the right
She sway to the right, rIght, right
And I'm taking my time
Doing everything right, right, right
Only get this high one time
That's right, right, right
I'ma lay right here,
I'ma let you ride, ride, ride
What you get for a year
I get on the side, on the side
And I'm taking my time
Doing everything
Right, right, right
Only get this high one time, time, time
I'ma lay right here,
I'ma let you ride, ride, ride
Only get this high right here one time

Only get this high
Right here one time
Only get this high
Right here one time

I've been feeling,
I've been feeling hurt
I've been feeling me
I've been feeling myself
Aye can't you see
In the fucking pocket,
Hella hella options
Care what they say,
Get 'em talk let 'em talk shit
Mainly for the freaks
if you're feeling yourself
Let me hear you sing
That shit from the bell

I've been getting mines
Everything on sight
I sway to the left, she sway to the right
She sway to the right, rIght, right
And I'm taking my time
Doing everything right,
Right, right
Only get this high one time
That's right, right, right
I'ma lay right here,
I'ma let you ride, ride, ride

What you get for a year
I get on the side, on the side
And I'm taking my time
Doing everything right,
Right, right
Only get this high
One time, time, time
I'ma lay right here,
I'ma let you ride, ride, ride
Only get this high
Right here one time
Only get this high
Right here one time
Only get this high
Right here one time
