Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows
Goodnight...

Gripping the brightest grid
A surgical drive to increase the noise
Ice cold realization of the silent wind

Slowly drags me
Into a splintered reason
Emptiness
Engulf me

Align the love inside me
Let misery wake me
Search low
Search low
Abandoned

The creaking floors cry out below
A limping glimpse of next steps
The fog showers the last light of day

Destroy the wooden frame
Trust the creaking sounds
Seek the tunnel
To walk high above
Search low
Trust the creaking sounds
Seek the tunnel
To walk high above
Search low
Destroy the wooden frame

Confront the night

Warm blood drips on cold snow
The curtain surrounds logical thought

Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows

Condemned to the gallows
Condemned
Condemned to the gallows
Condemned

Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows

Crimson moonbeam lights my journey
Crippled with time... strides into nothing
Crimson moonbeam lights... hear the waking
Crippled with time... strides into nothing
