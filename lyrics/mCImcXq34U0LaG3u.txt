Who stole the night from day
as the seers were washed away
God feared in whos arms i'm sleeping
And when the storm it came
and the light was vanishing
grew cold until there was no feeling
It's foregone
all foregone
the River's rising
Be still until the dawn
as the darkness shades you from
and dream of when the sky was bleeding
Be not the fallen wings
be not the withering
don't fear anybody's listening
It's foregone
all foregone
the River's rising
It's foregone
all foregone
the Wind is crying
