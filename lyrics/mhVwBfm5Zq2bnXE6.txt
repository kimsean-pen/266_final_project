Sing me to sleep, sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep pretty mamma to the beat
That's if you have time, that's if you have time
That's if you have time, that's if you have time

Go back, back when I was younger
We were filled with hope and filled with wonder
And we would rule the town
And we would take a bullet for each other
And all we ever wanted was a lover
And we would rule the town
Lay down way down in the cracks
And we would sell our souls and we ain't ever wantem back
Lay down way down in the cracks
And we would sell our souls and we ain't ever wantem back

And she would pucker her lips roll with her hips
And she moved like the ocean was the potion was a fix
She had a...
So thick it filled my fists
And she said "I don't wanna die but I don't wanna live like this."
"I don't wanna die but I don't wanna live like this."
She said "I don't wanna die but I don't wanna live like this."

That's if you have time sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep pretty mamma to the beat
Cuz I'm outta my mind the guitars they will weep
But sing me to sleep pretty mamma to the beat
That's if were both high, that's if were both high
That's if were both high, that's if were both high

Back when boy I was younger
The only thing we lived for was the summer
And we were willing out
And we didn't want nothin from each other
And we would play but all we heard was the thunder
They're shootin in my town
Get down, lay down on the floor
Don't move until you ain't hear that sound no more
Get down, lay down on the floor
Don't move until you ain't hear that sound no more

I'm at the end of my wits gun to my shit
And I wanna end it all cuz I don't wanna live like this
And she said "stay here with me I'll be here you'll see
Right here is where I'll stay baby Ill push them away baby
You have a voice like no one I've known has
They listen to you like when you speak it's mass."
When I was broken and I gave up you made me keep pursuing
You said "no one can tell it like you and you made me prove it to em"

And you'd lock your hips grab up on your tits
And you worked the floor and I was hypnotized by it
You had a...
So thick it filled my fists
And you said "I don't wanna die but I don't wanna live like this"
She said "I don't wanna die but I don't wanna live like this"
She said "I don't wanna die but I don't wanna live like this"

That's if you have time sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep pretty mamma to the beat
Cuz I'm outta my mind the guitars they will weep
But sing me to sleep pretty mamma to the beat
That's if were both high, that's if were both high
That's if were both high, that's if were both high

Roll under my wings
I see you doin wonderful things
But I can't be there I'm a hustler it seems
So I'm fallin down, down away from heaven
Down, down away from heaven

Roll under my wings
I see you doin wonderful things
But I can't be there I'm a hustler it seems
So I'm fallin down, down away from heaven
Down, down away from heaven

Roll under my wings
I see you doin wonderful things
But I can't be there I'm a hustler it seems
So I'm fallin down, down away from heaven
Down, down away from heaven

Roll under my wings
I see you doin wonderful things
But I can't be there I'm a hustler it seems
So I'm fallin down, down away from heaven
Down, down away from heaven

That's if you have time sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep pretty mamma to the beat
Cuz I'm outta my mind the guitars they will weep
But sing me to sleep pretty mamma to the beat
That's if were both high, that's if were both high
That's if were both high, that's if were both high
