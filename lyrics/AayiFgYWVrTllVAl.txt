Blurry TV Screens
Fuzzy broken scenes
Finding words don't have flow
Blurry TV Screens
Fuzzy broken scenes
Hold her close finding love

Hearts don't feel the same
And the names we like to say
Change with time and age
So I

I don't wanna say what's scripted
Whether you aren't with it
I know what I need
'Cause I

I don't wanna say what's scripted
Whether you aren't with it
I know what I need

Hearts don't feel the same
And the names we like to say
Change with time and age
So I

I don't wanna say what's scripted
Whether you aren't with it
I know what I need
'Cause I

I don't wanna say what's scripted
Whether you aren't with it
I know I what I need

You still remember my eyes
Even if the Men In Black flashed their light into your eyes
For the second time this night
Feels right when it's
Only you and I

Oh you and I
Oh you and I
Oh you and I
Oh you and I

So I
I don't wanna says what's scripted
Whether you aren't with it
I know what I need

'Cause I
I don't wanna say what's scripted
Whether you aren't with it
I know I what I need
