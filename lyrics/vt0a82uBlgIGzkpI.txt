I wanna say everything
Everything that I've got, that I've got
I haven't got a thing to lose
No nothing no, not at all, not at all
We gave everything that we had
11 years and 7 months
You chose to throw it all away
To something that you didn't love, couldn't hurt
So close, so tender unto
It's broken, forever shattered
One million pieces over
It's over, it's over
I don't really feel like laughing
It's not a joke not anymore
I don't really feel like crying
There's no tears here anymore
I don't really feel like trusting
It's not worth it anymore
Like the knife of a murderer and you're hurting me more and more
Took your time to arrive
I don't know the full story
Pulled me down, give me life
Everytime you could see there was more in her beautiful
Maybe I'll get it right, get it right next time
I can feel us slowly dying
There's no water anymore
I don't feel like we are drowning
You don't love me anymore
Can't you feel us slowly drowning?
I can't take this anymore
Like the knife of a murderer and you're killing me more and more
I don't really feel like laughing
It's not a joke not anymore
I don't really feel like crying
There's no tears here anymore
I don't really feel like trusting
It's not worth it anymore
Like the knife of a murderer and you're hurting me more and more
