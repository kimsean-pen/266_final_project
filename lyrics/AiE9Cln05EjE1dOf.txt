Nor the pain and the sorrow
Caused by my mistakes
Won't repent to a mortal
Whom is all to blame?
Now I know I won't make it

There will be a time

We'll get back our freedom
They can't break what's inside
I'll face it
'Cause it's the heart of everything
Open up your eyes

Save yourself from fading away now
Don't let it go
Open up your eyes
See what you've become, don't sacrifice

It's truly the heart of everything
Open up your eyes
Stay with me now I'm facing
My last solemn hour

Very soon i'll embrace you

On the other side
Hear the crowd in the distance
Screaming out my faith
Now their voices are fading
I can feel no more pain

I'll face it
'Cause it's the heart of everything
Open up your eyes
Save yourself, from fading away now
Don't let it go
Open up your eyes
See what you've become, don't sacrifice
It's truly the heart of everything
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Save yourself, from fading away now
Don't let it go
Open up your eyes
See what you've become, don't sacrifice
It's truly the heart of everything
