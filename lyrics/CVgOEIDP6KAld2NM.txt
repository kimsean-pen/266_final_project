So quiet.
Another wasted night
The television steals the conversation.
Exhale.
Another wasted breath
again it goes unnoticed.

Please tell me you're just feeling tired,
cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break.
Out of touch. Out of time.
Please send me anything but signals that are mixed,
cause I can't read your rolling eyes.
Out of touch. Are we out of time?

Closed lipped
another goodnight kiss
is robbed of all its passion.
Your grip
another time to slack
has left me feeling empty

Please tell me you're just feeling tired,
cause if it's more than that I feel that I might break.
Out of touch. Out of time
Please send me anything but signals that are mixed,
cause I can't read your rolling eyes.
Out of touch. Are we out of time?

I'll wait until tomorrow.
Maybe you'll feel better then,
maybe we'll be better then.
So what's another day
when I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you?
This mood of yours is temporary.
It seems worth the wait to see you smile again.
Out of the corner of my eye
won't be the only way you're looking at me then.

So quiet.
Another wasted night
the television steals the conversation.
Exhale.
Another wasted breath
again it goes unnoticed.
