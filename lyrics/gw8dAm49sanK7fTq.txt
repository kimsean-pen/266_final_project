Home, is this a quiet place where you should be alone?
Is this where the tortured and the troubled find their own?
I don't know, but I can tell this isn't you, your cover's blown
But oh no, don't you dare hang up this phone

Hey! Give me space so I can breathe
Give me space so I can sleep
Give me space so you can drown in this with me

In this place
The lonely escapade in outer space
There's no anecdote for irony
You say that you have, when you know
That you don't, and you say that you can
When you know that you won't

Hey! Give me space so I can breathe
Give me space so I can sleep
Give me space so you can drown in this with me

Hey! Give me space but I can't breathe
Give me space but I can't sleep
Give me just one inch I swear that's all I need, oh

These battered walls and TV screens
Sometimes they make me want to scream

Ahhh!

Hey! Give me space so I can breathe
Give me space so I can sleep
Give me space so you can drown in this with me

Hey! Give me space but I can't breathe
Give me space but I can't sleep
Give me just one inch I swear that's all I need
