Now the mask you're wearing
Is stoney and staring
Lines and tears, age and fears
Growing old, Passions cold
Now the mask you're wearing
Is stoney and staring
Lines and tears, age and fears
Growing old, passions cold

There's nothing in your eyes
That marks where you cried
All is blank, all is blind
Dead inside, the inner mind
There's nothing in your eyes
That marks where you cried
All is blank, all is blind
Dead inside, the inner mind
Is it me
Is it you
Behind this mask, I ask
Is it me
Is it you
Who wears another face
Is it me
Is it you
Behind this mask, I ask
I ask
I ask
