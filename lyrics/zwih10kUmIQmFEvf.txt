I'm holding on too long
Still sleep in your shirt,
But the rest of you is gone
Trying to fill in the space
that has your shape, mhm
Your memory's all over this place

But it doesn't matter
I'll forgive you even
If I shatter
All of our mistakes,
I'll make them matter
I know that I could hate you
But I'd rather remember
The day I loved you most
Remember the day I loved you most

Picking up the pieces
Of my mind
I'm so sick of healing
While you seem to be fine
Running out of reasons why
But it's alright, mhm
'Cause I don't need your
Blessing to move on with my life

'Cause it doesn't matter
I'll forgive you even if I shatter
All of our mistakes,
They make us better
I know that I could hate you
But I'd rather remember
The day I loved you most
Remember the day
I loved you most

Take it or leave it
(Could you forgive us?)
'Cause it's not about
Getting even
(Could you forgive us?)
Oh, could you forgive us?
(Could you forgive us?)
I'm right here if you need me
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

'Cause it doesn't matter
I'll forgive you even if I shatter
All of our mistakes,
They make us better
I know that I could hate you,
But I'd never
Remember the day
I loved you most
I'll remember the day
I loved you most
