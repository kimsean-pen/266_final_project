[Verse 1]
The candy ladies said knock knock knock,
Who wants to come to my candy shop,
I give you something to take back home,
To give you shivers that you didn't even know,
But listen honey it's drop by drop,
The stuff I'm sellin' it's hot hot hot,
Mr magic is not so toy,
He's gonna separate the men from the boys,
If every guy's a dog then baby throw me to the wolves,
I'll never get to heaven with my glass half full

[Chorus]
I've been waiting, all this time for you
And I've been hatin' all this talkin baby, black and blue,
Cos I've been praying, whats a girl to do
Cos it's been hard not tryin to bite you with the things I knew

[Verse 2]
Hey there buttercup,
Your like a peach on ice,
I'm gonna heat your body up,
And pray that it treats me good tonight,
Hey boy saddle up,
Don't have to twist my arm,
I like it when you lift my body up,
And just enough to send me to the stars,
All night, been lookin at,
Your hard-earned, six pack
Alright, I'll take ya back,
Feels like

[Repeat chorus]

[Middle 8]
Rap bap, the boy can do,
Don't stop the rhythm cos I'm coming through,
Rap bap, the boy can move,
Backtrack the middle till I'm in the groove

Rap bap, the boy can do,
Don't stop the rhythm cos I'm coming through,
Rap bap, the boy can move,
Backtrack the middle till I'm in the groove

[Repeat verse 1]

[Repeat chorus]

[Repeat middle 8]
