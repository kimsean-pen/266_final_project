i'm finished with my woman
cause she couldn't help me with my mind
people think i'm insane
because i am frowning all the time

all day long i think of things
but nothing seems to satisfy
i think i will lose my mind
if i don't find something to qualify

can you help me
help me with my brain

and so as you hear these words
telling you of my fate
i tell you to enjoy life
i wish i could but it's too late

make a joke i will sigh
and you will laugh and i will cry
happiness i cannot feel
and love to me is so unreal

i must be paranoid
