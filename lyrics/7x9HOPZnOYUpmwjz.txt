Oh, oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh

I see you looking at the magazines
Watching girls on the MTV

But they don't even look half as good to me
Hey, yeah

A pony-tail and a pair of sweats

You still look like a perfect 10
Baby you can wear anything

No matter what you do
You look beautiful

How else can I say it?
Feel like a broken record

You think I'm crazy and it's true
I'm crazy for you
Yeah, that's right, I said it
Girl, you're my perfect 10, yeah
You think I'm crazy and it's true

I'm crazy for you
Oh, oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm crazy, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm crazy, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh

I'm crazy for you

Got a temperature of 103:
Even sick as a dog
You look cute to me
Even at your worst

You're still the best
Yeah!
Hey pretty lady
Yeah-you're so fly!

If I was a pilot

I'd write your name in the sky
But that pretty face don't compare to what's inside

No-oh-oh-oh matter what you do
You are beautiful, yeah

How else can I say it?
Feel like a broken record

You think I'm crazy and it's true
I'm crazy for you
Yeah, that's right, I said it
Girl, you're my perfect 10, yeah
You think I'm crazy and it's true

I'm crazy for you
Oh, oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm crazy, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm crazy, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm crazy for you

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey everybody
Girl so good, good, good
Gotta tell somebody
You can even call me insane, but it won't change a thing (hey yeah)

How else can I say it?
Feel like a broken record (a broken record)
You think I'm crazy and it's true
I'm crazy for you
Yeah, that's right, I said it
Girl, you're my perfect 10, yeah
You think I'm crazy and it's true
I'm crazy for you
Oh, oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm crazy, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm crazy, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm crazy for you
