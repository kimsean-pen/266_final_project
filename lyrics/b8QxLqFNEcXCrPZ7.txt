Lie to me like you used to
Tell me everything is how it should be
Lie to me, did you have to
Because in the end it never matters what I think
And I can barely tell the sky from the shoreline
And I can see myself reflected in your eyes
And this was all a dream
And it's coming back to me
A portrait in grey scale
A perfect betrayal
And I can't even breathe with this weighing on my chest
You knew me at my best
Now I can't even stand on my own
