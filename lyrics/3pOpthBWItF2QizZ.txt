Something
Slowly
Building up from the ground

Touch me
Softly
I choose you from the crowd
From the crowd
You bring my heart to life again

Running
Only
To get closer to you

Now my
Vision
Is so focused on you
On you, on you

I couldn't see me fall
But now I see it all
You bring my heart to life again
Now I can see in ultraviolet

My eyes are open wide
I'm blinded by your light
You bring my heart to life again
Now I can see in ultraviolet

You bring my heart to life again
Now I can see in ultraviolet

Running
Only
To get closer to you

Now my
Vision
Is so focused on you
On you, on you

I couldn't see me fall
But now I see it all
You bring my heart to life again
Now I can see in ultraviolet

My eyes are open wide
I'm blinded by your light
You bring my heart to life again
Now I can see in ultraviolet

I couldn't see me fall
But now I see it all
You bring my heart to life again
Now I can see in ultraviolet

My eyes are open wide
I'm blinded by your light
You bring my heart to life again
Now I can see in ultraviolet
