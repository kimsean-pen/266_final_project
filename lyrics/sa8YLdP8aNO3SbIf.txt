(I never thought that I had to be
This protector
So many thoughts inside my head
A strange collector)
But now
But now
But now
Now, now, now, now, now
You thought you heard a sound
There's no one else around
Looking at the door
It's coming through the floor

300 people living out in
West virginia
Have no idea
Of all these thoughts that lie
Within ya
But now
But now
But now
Now, now, now, now, now

You thought you heard a sound
There's no one else around
Looking at the door
It's coming through the floor
