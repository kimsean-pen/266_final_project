Heard you own a new car and a big home (big home)
Owning everything but your mistakes
For what, for what, for what?
Showing off your art and all your new gold (new gold)
Acting like Usain Bolt
So what, so what, so what?

Baby, tell me where your friends now?
Baby, that's you on the way down
You know I be there to catch ya
'Cause I'm faded with my arms out
But you won't remember when I
Call on you when I break

How can you love me?
How can you love me?
How can you love me?
How can you love me?
How can you love me?
How can you love me when you don't have a heart?
When you don't have a heart
When you don't have a heart
When you don't have a heart
When you don't have a heart

Standing in the foyer in the silence (silence)
Penthouse feel like an asylum
Alone, alone, alone
Riding off my love without a license (license)
That ain't feed you falling from your high risk
As you watch me go

Baby, tell me where your friends now?
Baby, that's you on the way down
You know I be there to catch ya
'Cause I'm faded with my arms out
But you won't remember when I
Call on you when I break

How can you love me?
How can you love me?
How can you love me?
How can you love me?
How can you love me?
How can you love me
When you don't have a heart?
When you don't have a heart?
When you don't have a heart?
When you don't have a heart?
When you don't have a heart?

Heart out of reflections
Your fake friends, they all come and go
Come and go
Big nights and stay-at-homes may crumble
But my love will grow
My love will grow

When you don't have a heart?
When you don't have a heart?
When you don't have a heart?
When you don't have a heart?
When you don't have a heart?

When you don't have a heart?
When you don't have a heart?
When you don't have a heart?
