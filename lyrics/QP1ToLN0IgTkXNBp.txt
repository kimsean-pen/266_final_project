We were leaning on a one night stand
I was keeping up and no one cared
I was leaving you alone but still
I was hoping you were some place near
'Cause if given just another chance
I would do it all again
And I would take my sweet, damn time
So long as I can call it mine

Hey, you can call on me
If you called on me
I'd come running
I say, hey, you can call on me
If you called on me
I'd come running

If you wanted, we could leave this place
I'm thinking leave it all behind
I can handle all these things
So long as I can call it mine
So long as I can call you mine
I would take my sweet, damn time

Hey, you can call on me
If you called on me
I'd come running
I say, hey, you can call on me
If you called on me
I'd come running, I'd come running

Hey, you can call on me
If you called on me
I'd come running, running, running

We were leaning on a one night stand
I was keeping up and no one cared
I was leaving you alone but still
I was hoping you were some place near
And if you wanted, we could leave this place
I'm thinking leave it all behind
So long as I can call you mine
I'd come running, running, running
I'd come running, running, running
I'd come running, running, running
I'd come running, running, running
I'd come running
I'd come running
