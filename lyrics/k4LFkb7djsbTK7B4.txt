I need your help with all of this
I can't keep running round in circles
Is there something that I missed
I just can't just figure it out
Figure it out
I keep my mind away from home
So I don't drown in desperation
I can't keep going on alone
I just need someone for conversation
(I need you)
We'll li around from all of this
(I can't go home)
Hiding out from all of this
(I can't go home)

Is someone there?
I need your help and
I'm on my own
And I've been thinking
That I'm so lost
I'm slowly sinking
Out on my own

Into my thinking

I didn't want to drag them down
I couldn't really work it out

And even though it all went south
I still can't figure it out, figure it out

And I dived so deep
Into my brain

I cant sleep
I think I'm losing all my friends
you know the devil plays for keeps

Is someone there
I need your help and
I'm on my own
And I've been thinking

I'm so lost
I'm slowly sinking
Out on my own
Into my thinking

Is someone there
I need your help
Is someone there
I need your help and
I'm on my own
And I've been thinking
That I'm so lost
I'm slowly sinking
Out on my own
Into my thinking
(Woah)
Is someone there?
(Woah)
I need your help!
(Woah)
Is someone there?
I need your help!
