Oh no, what's my locker combo?
It's the birthday of a Leonardo

Bells ringing and I gotta go
And I'm single if you gotta know
I'm so over James Dean
I'm more of a three names queen

Freddie Prinze Junior, Chad Michael Murray
Want you to be my, want you to be my

Nineties heartthrob
Frosted tips and a middle part
Tigerbeat said he's off the charts

Nineties heartthrob
We can sneak out after dark
Be an angsty teen, let you break my

Heartthrob, heartthrob, heartthrob

I'll go through your Trapper keeper
I'll wanna get to know you deeper

Got a cutie waiting in the cafeteria
Gotta grab a seat right next to you
I'm so over James Dean
I'm more of a three names queen

Freddie Prinze Junior, John Taylor Thomas
Want you to be my, want you to be my

Nineties heartthrob
Frosted tips and a middle part
Tigerbeat said he's off the charts

Nineties heartthrob
We can sneak out after dark
Be an angsty teen, let you break my

Heartthrob, heartthrob, heartthrob

H-E-A-R double T, H-R-O-B
Joey, Lance and J.T
Maybe Chris after a couple drinks

H-E-A-R double T, H-R-O-B
Joey, Lance and J.T
Don't forget JC, he can really sing

Nineties heartthrob
Frosted tips and a middle part
Tigerbeat said he's off the charts

Nineties heartthrob
We can sneak out after dark
Be an angsty teen, let you break my

Heartthrob, heartthrob, heartthrob
