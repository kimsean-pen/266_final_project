Some like to play you blind
Just to win
For a flower to grow
The seed must rot

Change my mind deep in the dark
Down the left to keep from
The nobody's face
My friend the walls

Outside they all grow fear
Off the record
When nobody is there
My friend the walls

When I get my hands on you
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

When I get my hands on you
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh

When I get my hands on you

In the dark
Changes his mind
Everybody thinks to
The name of a street
Sad, solemn day

When I get my hands on you
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

When I get my hands on you
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh

When I get my hands on you
Oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh)
Oh oh oh-oh oh-oh

Writing songs
Close the door
All I've loved since '94
So I don't wanna give away
But I give it anyway
On the floor
Close the door
I can't watch this anymore
