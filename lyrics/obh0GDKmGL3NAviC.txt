I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would come meet her connection
At her feet was her footloose man

And, you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime you might find
You get what you need.

When I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse"

And,you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you might find
You get what you need.

And,you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you might find
You get what you need.

Oh yeah, hey hey hey, oh...
You get what you need.
Oh yeah, hey hey hey, oh...

You get what you need.
