Every night
I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms

Because I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to
Dream alone

Dream lover, where are you?
With a love, oh so true
And a hand that I can hold
Feel you near
As I grow old

Because I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to
Dream alone

Someday, I don't know how
I hope
She'll hear my plea
Someway, I don't know how
She'll bring her
Love to me

Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep
And dream again
That's the only thing to do
'Til all my lover's dreams come true

Because I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to
Dream alone

Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep
And dream again
That's the only thing to do
'Til all my lover's dreams come true

Because I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to
Dream alone

Please, don't make me dream
Alone
