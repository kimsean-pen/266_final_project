Now that the show is over
And we have jointly exercised our constitutional rights
We would like to leave you with one very important thought

Sometime in the future, you may have the opportunity
To serve as a juror in a censorship case or a so-called obscenity case
It would be wise to remember that the same people
Who'd stop you from listening to Boards Of Canada
May be back next year to complain about a book, or even a TV program

If you could be told of what you can see or read
Then it follows that you can be told what to say or think
Defend your constitutionally protected rights
No one else will do it for you, thank you
