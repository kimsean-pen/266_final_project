I'm going back to where I came from
So far away but not so far from home
Where I lay my head down by the sea
I'm going back to where we'd go
So far away but not so far from home
Where I'd rest, where I'd lay so peacefully

But bye the way
I want a break and want to put this stress aside
But above all things I wanna lay by the oceanside
The ocean waves, no other way, get away
Well I'm finding
Oh no my daily worries want to drift away, fine
Dyin' and tryin' just to find some sort of peace of mind
Now the time, to get away

I'm going away oh yeah
No other place to go, I've got to get away
Let's get away oh, away

One more minute, the beaches San Diego
One more minute yeah
One more minute, the beaches Mexico
One more minute yeah
One more minute, we kick it back pool side
One more minute and we're down bye the ocean side
One more minute, one more minute, one more minute

So far away and dowdy on the beach
I want to clear my head and break it in the warm sunshine
Want to relay relaxation
With the horizon straight away
And a ring around my arm from a long day
Of making angels in the sand
Picifico in my hand oh yeah

No other place to go, I've got to get away
Let's get away oh, away

One more minute, the beaches San Diego
One more minute yeah
One more minute, the beaches Mexico
One more minute yeah
One more minute, we kick it back pool side
One more minute and we're down bye the ocean side
One more minute, one more minute, one more minute

The sunshine in my eyes and the flamenco in the skies
The only way you'll ever know, is to go, is to go
Here we go
Away

One more minute, the beaches San Diego
One more minute yeah
One more minute, the beaches Mexico
One more minute yeah
One more minute, we kick it back pool side
One more minute and we're down bye the ocean side
One more minute, one more minute, one more minute

Shed the light all all all all day
Shed the light all day, shed the light all all all day
Shed the light all day, shed the light all all all day
Shed the light all day, shed the light all all all day
Shed the light all all all day
Shed the light all day, shed the light all all all day
Shed the light all day, shed the light all all all day
Shed the light all day

One more minute, the beaches San Diego
One more minute yeah
One more minute, the beaches Mexico
One more minute yeah
One more minute, we kick it back pool side
One more minute, and we're down bye the ocean side
One more minute, one more minute, one more minute
shed the light all all all day
