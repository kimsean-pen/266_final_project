Now I've got a fainting heart
You leave and it all goes dark
Wake up in the light so cold
If you feel the same I never know

Is this the way that you wanted?
Are you certain?
I'll be your all or nothing
So what's the outcome?
Was I just someone?

But I'll tell you one thing
I'm all or nothing, it's all or nothing now
It's your decision
This love for division
We're all together nothing now

Feel like I've committed a crime
Waiting to resume my life
I'm waiting between heaven and hell
Maybe you should ask yourself

Is this the way that you wanted?
Are you certain?
I'll be your all or nothing
So what's the outcome?
Was I just someone?

But I'll tell you one thing
I'm all or nothing, it's all or nothing now
It's your decision
This love for division
We're all together nothing now

We're just in between now
What are we today?
How am I to feel with
You're so far away

We're just in between now
What are we today?
How am I to feel with
You're so far away

Is this the way that you wanted?
Are you certain?
I'll be your all or nothing
So what's the outcome?
Was I just someone?

But I'll tell you one thing
I'm all or nothing, it's all or nothing now
It's your decision
This love for division
We're all together nothing now

But I'll tell you one thing
I'm all or nothing, it's all or nothing now
It's your decision
This love for division
We're all together nothing now
