Leaves just fall
Lost my way again
Lights me still
Where it starts to bend
Lonely heart
Visit me but it's cold, ah-ah ah...

Looking outside
I'm scared to die
The sky won't hold light
It leaves me blind
How can I find the sun?
Looking outside
Looking outside
Oh, what's the use?
The sky won't hold light
It leaves me too
How can I find the sun?
Looking outside

Lost control
Hear it calling in
The room was small
Walls were closing in
Won't you wait
Lose the trace but it's cold
Ah, ah, ah

I don't have the heart
It takes hold of me
Felt a world apart
It takes hold of me

Looking outside
I'm scared to die
The sky won't hold light
It leaves me blind
How can I find the sun?
Looking outside
Looking outside
Oh, what's the use?
The sky won't hold light
It leaves me too
How can I find the sun?
Looking outside

Looking outside
I'm scared to die
The sky won't hold light
It leaves me blind
How can I find the sun?
Looking outside
Looking outside
Oh, what's the use?
The sky won't hold light
It leaves me too
How can I find the sun?
Looking outside
