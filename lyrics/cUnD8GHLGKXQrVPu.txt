You say, I only hear what I want to
And you say, I talk so all the time, so

And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leavin'
Now I know that I did somethin' wrong
'Cause I missed you

Yeah yeah, I missed you
And you say, I only hear what I want to
I don't listen hard, don't pay attention
To the distance that you're running
To anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care

I'm only hearing negative, no no no, bad
So I, I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up
And this woman was singin' my song
Lover's in love and the other's run away
Lover is cryin', 'cause the other won't stay
Some of us hover when we weepin' for the other
Who was dying since the day they were born, well
Well, this is not that I think that I'm throwing
But I'm thrown

And I thought I'd live forever
But now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever

But that won't take me anyhow
Or anywhere with you
And you said that I was naive
And I thought that I was stronger
I thought, hey I can leave, I can leave

Oh but now I know that I was wrong
'Cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you
You said, "You caught me
'Cause you want me"
One day you'll let me go
You try to give away a keeper
Or keep me 'cause you know
You're just so scared to lose
And you say, "Stay"
And you say, I only hear what I want to
