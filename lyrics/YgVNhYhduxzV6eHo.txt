How was the gold?
Along the path of eternity hold
Although it called on a pair on its way
Blinded with hot glass and calling off steam
There was still smoke

Burnt in the glass
Reclaim your portion and pass it inside
And in the stories of long lost entry
Bound into harmlessly have fallen here
Then we came so

And I was in the falling of love
Coming up in harder clay
I was in the corner of the star
I was in it so much more
I was in the falling of love
Coming up in harder clay
Time wasn't the only coward now

My hope, my God, smoke shot sharp out via the river
Out to the only ocean
There's something peaceful that goes out via the river
Out to the ocean
I was peaceful, standing, I was open

And I was in the falling of love
Coming up in harder clay
I was in the corner of the star
I was in it so much more
I was in the falling of love
Coming up in harder clay
Time wasn't the only coward now.
Time wasn't the only coward
