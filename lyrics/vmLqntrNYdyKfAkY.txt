The devastation is immense
And the war princesses' army retires to higher ground
Preparing the final stage of their attack
Ziltoid, during all of this is held in the highest security prison
Every human's prior affection for him has all turned sour
Everyone that is, except the leader of the human army
The one with the last word on his fate
Captain Spectacular!
The world's hero holds a secret
It seems Spectacular knows something about Ziltoid
But can he trust him? Does he have any choice?
Why am I talking to myself?
The captain decides to make a deal
Perhaps this alien knows of some other way to combat the war princess?
Spectacular goes to Ziltoid
It may be humanity's only hope
"Ziltoid, I am Captain Spectacular!
And I hold your fate, speak now, but choose your words wisely..."
