Strangers on your breath
Feed me your lies
Shoot me like a star
Falling from the sky

You're a crook, I'm a thief
You're the heart, I'm the beat
We're a mess, but we try
We're alive, we can hardly breathe
I can't leave
'Till death do us part
But my hearts getting dark
On the edge of the cliff
This cars gonna start

Now I can't breathe

Do you wanna way out?
Do you? Do you?
Do you wanna way out?
Do you?
I don't wanna way out
You and I know the truth
Even though it hurts

I just wanna be a criminal with you
Criminal with you
We're criminals

Running from the lights

Can't stop 'till the end
Only one design like fire and ice
Heaven I want you, heaven I want you
Heaven I want you, heaven I want you

Do you wanna way out?
Do you? Do you?

Do you wanna way out?
Do you?
I don't wanna way out
You and I know the truth
Even though it hurts
I just wanna be a criminal with you
Criminal with you
We're criminals

You're a crook, I'm a thief
You're the heart, I'm the beat
We're a mess, but we try
We're alive, we can hardly breathe
I can't leave
'Till death do us part
But my hearts getting dark
On the edge of the cliff
This cars gonna start
Now I can't breathe

Do you wanna way out?
Do you? Do you?
Do you wanna way out?
Do you?
I don't wanna way out
You and I know the truth
Even though it hurts
I just wanna be a criminal with you
We don't wanna way out
You and I know the truth
I just wanna be a criminal with you
Criminal with you
(Do you?)
I just wanna be a criminal with you
We're criminals
