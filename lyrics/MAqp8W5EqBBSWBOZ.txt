Hi Los Angeles
This is Naomi Elizabeth
I love you

God sent me here to rock you
He gave me a job to do
He told me girl you have to show them
the way I do things here in heaven
God sent me here to rock you all
And fill this building up with gospel
He told me girl just stay a little while
And show them all my style

Hot like the tropics

God sent me here to rock you
He gave me a job to do
He sent me down because he knew
It's something no one else can do
God sent me here to rock you all and fill this building up with gospel
He told me girl just stay a little while
And show them all my style

Hot, make it hot, make it hot, make it hot, make it hotter
make it hot, make it hot, make it hot, make it hotter

I flew down on cloud
And set my feet on the ground
I had a job to do

To rock every one of you

Hot like the tropics

So I'm standing here in front of you
To finish what I told him I would do
I'll fill this building up with gospel
Even If I have to yell

Hot, make it hot, make it hot, make it hot, make it hotter
make it hot, make it hot, make it hot, make it hotter

I flew down on a cloud
And set my feet on the ground
I had a job to do

To rock everyone of you

God sent me here to rock you
He gave me a job to do
He told me girl you have to show them
The way I do things here in heaven
God sent me here to rock you all
And fill this building up with gospel
He told me girl just stay a little while
And show them all my style

Hot like the tropics
