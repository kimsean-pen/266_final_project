Do you forgive me?
You never lost your sight
So scream your heart out
To reject one more time

This tragic, need for hope
Won't give up
It's what, keeps us alive
Now who will survive
In this game of chess
Now hold out your hand
And give me
This final kiss

If I load this gun, would you hold in your heart and give your life for love?

So bleed (so bleed)
This hate (this hate)
With me
And fight these broken dreams

If I load this gun, would you give your life for love?

So bleed (so bleed)
This hate (this hate)
With me
And fight these broken dreams!

This is more than hopeless romantics
I will never let it die
I walk the line
And your daybreak eyes
The whispers
And the brand new scars
The brand new scars

Do you forgive me?
We will never let this die
We scream our hearts out
To reject one more time

If I load this gun, could you hold it to your heart and give your life, your love?

So bleed
This hate
With me
And fight these broken dreams

So bleed
This hate
And fight these broken dreams

If I load this gun will you hold it to your heart and give your life for love?

So bleed (so bleed)
This hate (this hate)
With me
And fight these broken dreams
And fight these broken dreams

And fight
Fight
Fight
Fight
Fight

These broken dreams
