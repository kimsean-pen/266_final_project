(Is anyone up? Is anyone up?)
(Your pussy, your boobies)
And I tell you I'm sorry girl
It was nothing personal
Is anyone up? Is anyone up?
Your pussy, your boobies

On the world wide web
Girl, it's nothing personal
I'm sorry for this
But I think you fuck anal so well

That everybody should know
Your pussy deserves much more attention

Than I could give to you
You said that I'd be the only one
You are nothing more than a folder on my harddisk
And you are nothing more than the guys I've met before

Fuck you little whore I've got your cunt in HD
And I tell you I'm sorry girl
It was nothing personal
Is anyone up? Is anyone up?
Your pussy, your boobies
On the world wide web
And I tell you I'm sorry girl

It was nothing personal
Is anyone up? Is anyone up?
Your pussy, your boobies
On the world wide web

On the world wide web
Oh lord, shame on me!
Gnargoyles everywhere
I've lost my ability
To infactuate hot chicks

You never will expose a girl again
Your daddy will be proud of his stupid little girl
Shut the fuck up
Tonight I'm on a photo date
With the highschool-sexgrenade
And I tell you I'm sorry girl
It was nothing personal

Is anyone up? Is anyone up?
Your pussy, your boobies
On the world wide web
And I tell you I'm sorry girl

It was nothing personal
Is anyone up? Is anyone up?
Your pussy, your boobies
On the world wide web
I've seen a lot of boobies
I've seen a lot of cunts
As long as there are hot chicks
There'll be always men that hunt
#NBHNC (What?)
Means a lot to me (Aha!)
We cannot stop to stare
So put your ass up in the air (Oh, fuck me!)
