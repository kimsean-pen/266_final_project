Selling stories that were overrated
In this world so complicated
Felt so right, you tried to make it wrong
Why can't we all just get along?

From the start something wasn't right
I used to cry myself to sleep at night
Told myself stand up, be strong
This kind of phase doesn't last for long

And every time you try to knock me down
Gonna pick my back up off the ground
The battle never ends, yeah

You can tear me apart, you can rip me to pieces
Try breaking me down but I'll never be beated
You can say that you won but I'll never believe it
'Cause I can't be defeated

Made a mistake, swore I'll never repeat it
Lost my heart for a second but it never stopped beating
I smile through the tears so the way that I see it
I can't be defeated

There are times that I couldn't take it
Never felt so violated
At the risk of sounding so cliche
I just gotta call a spade a spade

Hurts me right to the core
I can't take this anymore
Getting tired of the same old song
Final chorus now I'm moving on

Things ain't fair in love and war
Never been the kind to be ignored
Tried to push me to the edge

Yeah, you can tear me apart, you can rip me to pieces
Try breaking me down but I'll never be beated
You can say that you won but I'll never believe it
'Cause I can't be defeated

Made a mistake, swore I'll never repeat it
Lost my heart for a second but it never stopped beating
I smile through the tears so the way that I see it
I can't be defeated

Nothing is impossible, nothing is unreachable
If you only believe then you get what you need
So keep on holdin' on

You can tear me apart, you can rip me to pieces
Try breaking me down but I'll never be beated
You can say that you won but I'll never believe it
'Cause I can't be defeated
Made a mistake, swore I'll never repeat it
Lost my heart for a second but it never stopped beating
I smile through the tears so the way that I see it
I can't be defeated
No, no, never
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no
