Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be something missing

Now that you found it
It's gone

Now that you feel it
You don't
You've gone off the rails

So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

You'll go to Hell
For what your dirty mind
Is thinking
