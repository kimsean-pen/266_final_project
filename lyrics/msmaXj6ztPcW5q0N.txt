I'm picking up again
Well it got too much
After the accident
It could feel no worse

I turned around and saw him hit the ground
A little earlier, it was a game
I guess the barrier
Must have dropped away

I don't like to read the news
Do you know anything I'm going through?

I don't like to read the news
Do you know anything I'm going through?
And shake us

Did you see my photograph?
It was on page ten
I swore to everyone
I'm not to blame

I turned around and saw him hit the ground
A little earlier it was a game
I'm so disposable
You can throw me away

I don't like to read the news
Do you know anything I'm going through?

I don't like to read the news
Do you know anything I'm going through?
And shake us

What a fool I've been
Didn't get to him in time
What's been happening?
It's so hard to sleep at night
It's so hard to sleep at night
To sleep at night

I don't like to read the news
Do you know anything I'm going through?

I don't like to read the news
Do you know anything I'm going through?
And shake us
