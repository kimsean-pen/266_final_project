Looking at the spot where you were yesterday
It's like you vaporized through the bed frame
I knew that I would miss those late night ghost stories
But I had no idea it would keep me awake

Living in too many parking lots this week
It's on one hand, but it's more than it should be
Leaves scraping on the street, emulating bloody knees
Another night spent obliviously

But it's hidden in plain sight
Yeah, t's all right there in front of you
I couldn't stay outside
But I couldn't stand to lie next to you

Do I have a reason to ask you
Why you kept me from something new?
Well, I waited for nothing
Me from something new
I waited for nothing
Me from something new
I'm waiting for nothing
Me from something new

It's hidden in plain sight
Yeah, it's all right there in front of you
I couldn't stay outside
But I couldn't stand to lie next to you
And all your friends
I heard every single word you said
You and all your friends
I heard every single word you said
Said, said, said
