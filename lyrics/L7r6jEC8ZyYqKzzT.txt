Let's go!

Baby, I need a chance to make you understand.
I live my life for you till the better end.
I confessed my love to you.
In my dreams I have faith that you feel it too.

All my life I've been into you.
So take a deep breath when I say to you:
Baby, I just wanna make it stop. Right now!
This chase took a big part of me, but you never really cared.
You are the one that I wanna spend my life with.

It's tearing up my heart when I'm with you.
But when we are apart I feel it too.
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain.
With or without you.

So tell me, how can I make you feel my love?
When will I be the one that you're dreaming of?
This love is more than I ever felt before.
And I know you're the one that is worth fighting for.

All my life I've been into you.
So take a deep breath when I say to you:
Baby, I just wanna make it stop. Right now!
This chase took a big part of me, but you never really cared.
You are the one that I wanna spend my life with.

It's tearing up my heart when I'm with you.
But when we are apart I feel it too.
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain.
With or without you.

Tearin' up my heart and soul.
We're apart I feel it too.
And no matter what I do I feel the pain.
With or without you.

Tearin' up my heart and soul.
We're apart I feel it too.
And no matter what I do I feel the pain.
With or without you.

It's tearing up my heart
It's tearing up my heart

It's tearing up my heart when I'm with you.
But when we are apart I feel it too.
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain.
With or without you.

It's tearing up my heart when I'm with you.
But when we are apart I feel it too.
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain.
With or without you.

Let's go!

And no matter what I do, I feel the pain.
