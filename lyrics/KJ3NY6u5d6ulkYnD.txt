When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
And nothin', no nothin' is goin' right
You just close your eyes and think of me
And soon I'll be there to brighten up
Yeah, even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know, wherever I am
I'll come a-runnin', yeah, yeah
To see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will
You've got a friend, oh yeah
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
You've got a friend

When the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind
Yeah, he begins to blow
Here's what you do, baby
Keep your head together (together)
Together, baby
And call my name out loud
And soon you'll hear me knocking
Knockin' at your door
Oh yes I will, yes I will

You just call out my name
And you know, wherever I am
I'll come a-runnin', yeah, yeah
To see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will

Ain't it good to know
That you've got a friend
People can be so cold
They'll hurt you, yeah
And desert you (and desert you)
And take your soul if you let them
Oh, don't let them
No, no, no, don't let them

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, I'll be there, yes I will

You've got a friend, yes you do
You've got a friend, yes you do
Right till the end, for you
Ain't it good to know

You've got a friend, yes you do
You've got a friend, yes you do
Right till the end, for you
Ain't it good to know

You've got a friend, yes you do
You've got a friend, yes you do
Right till the end, for you
Ain't it good to know

You've got a friend, yes you do
You've got a friend, yes you do...
