A pearl for a heart and buttons for the eyes
Stuffed inside with cloves and spices
Chant your words in the night
With needle and thread sew together your strange devices

But I don't feel these pins and needles
These pins and needles
You have no power here
No, I don't fear you anymore

No black magic can control me
And no curse can let you own me
There's nothing you can do or say
I'm just gonna do it anyway
So go ahead, carve your candle
With that knife with the white handle
This is my life after all
I'm not you voodoo doll

With your old book of spells and strands of my hair
You whisper the incantation
It's your remote control over my heart and soul
My behavior is your creation

But I don't feel these pins and needles
These pins and needles
You have no power here
No, I don't fear you anymore

No black magic can control me
And no curse can let you own me
There's nothing you can do or say
I'm just gonna do it anyway
So go ahead, carve your candle
With that knife with the white handle
This is my life after all
I'm not you voodoo doll
I'm not you voodoo doll
I'm not you voodoo doll

Voodoo doll

I don't belong to anyone
I'm not a puppet with my strings in your hand
I don't belong to anyone
I won't obey your commands

No black magic can control me
And no curse can let you own me
There's nothing you can do or say
I'm just gonna do it anyway

No black magic can control me
And no curse can let you own me
There's nothing you can do or say
I'm just gonna do it anyway
So go ahead, carve your candle
With that knife with the white handle
This is my life after all
I'm not you voodoo doll

Voodoo doll
I'm not your voodoo doll
Voodoo doll
Voodoo doll
