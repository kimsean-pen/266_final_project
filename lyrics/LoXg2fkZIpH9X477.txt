As he walked the barren fields
And salted the earth
The rain was an echo
And all the seasons pale and sullen

In tears of sorrow and longing
The wanderer falls
Alone adrift in damming silence
His blood is drawn

He left us an opus
For a thousand aeons to come
In Runes of salted writing
In Tears and blood

Ride on, Spirit of Joy
Although the land is dying
And all the voices singing of hope are gone

Fly on, Spirit of Joy
And shine the daylight upon
The heart of the new-born one

Your Echoes Shall always
Resound through our halls
Your ghost in reverence
Embrace to haunt me

And his name shall never be known
All his reasons forgotten
And gone
Like the wind that drowned his screams
The salted earth alone
It wept and drew his form
Preserving his Essence
A Stark reminder to all

Ride on, Spirit of Joy
Although the land is dying
And all the voices singing of hope are gone

Fly on, Spirit of Joy
And shine the daylight upon
The heart of the new-born one

Ride on, Spirit of Joy
Although the land is dying
And all the voices singing of hope are gone

Fly on, Spirit of Joy
And shine the daylight upon
The heart of the new-born one
