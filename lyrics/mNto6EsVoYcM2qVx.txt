Get me up and get me out
Running in the city with a brand new sound
They got it figured out
Burning up in smoke, talking slow as they spin around

Your mind is drowning in the blood red wine
Intoxicated with the violet lights
Meet me in the middle of a crowded line tonight

'Cause it's a slow dance night
Everybody out there wasting time
It's a slow dance night
Everybody out there,
Everybody out there
Oooh ooooh oooh oooh ooooh oooh
Everybody out there wasting time
Oooh ooooh oooh oooh ooooh oooh
Everybody out there,
Everybody out there

Come on and let it out
Loosen up the collar on the night you found
Lets take it underground
Nevermind the world on the outside is shutting down

Your mind is drowning in the blood red wine
Intoxicated with the noise inside
Meet me in the middle of a crowded line tonight

'Cause it's a slow dance night
Everybody out there wasting time
It's a slow dance night
Everybody out there,
Everybody out there
Oooh ooooh oooh oooh ooooh oooh
Everybody out there wasting time
Oooh ooooh oooh oooh ooooh oooh
Everybody out there,
Everybody out there

Oooh ooooh oooh oooh ooooh oooh

'Cause it's a slow dance night
Everybody out there wasting time
It's a slow dance night
Everybody out there,
Everybody out there
Oooh ooooh oooh oooh ooooh oooh
Everybody out there wasting time
Oooh ooooh oooh oooh ooooh oooh
Everybody out there,
Everybody out there

'Cause it's a slow dance night!
