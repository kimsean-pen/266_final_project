Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away.
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away.
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away.
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why.
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why.
Cry, boy, cry.
Cry, boy, cry.
Cry, boy, cry, boy cry.
Cry, boy, cry, boy cry.
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why.
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why.
No you never cried to them
Just to your soul.
No you never cried to them
Just to your soul.
