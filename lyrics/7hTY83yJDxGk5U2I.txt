So Jesus left you lonely
Feels like nothing's really holy
No one, no one hears your calling
Falling, everything is falling

Do you feel alive?
Can you feel alive?
Do you feel alive?
Can you feel alive?

So Jesus left you lonely
Feels like nothing's really holy
No one, no one hears your calling
Falling, everything is falling

Do you feel alive?
Can you feel alive?
Do you feel alive?
Can you feel alive?

Try so hard just to speak to you
Nothing ever seems to come through
Circumstances on the breaking back
Try, sit down is a therapy

Oh salvation
Oh salvation
Oh salvation
Oh salvation

Do you feel alive?
Can you feel alive?
Do you feel alive?
Can you feel alive?

Do you feel alive?
Can you feel alive?
Do you feel alive?
Can you feel alive?
