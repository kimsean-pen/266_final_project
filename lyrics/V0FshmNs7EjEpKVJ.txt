Was I wrong about the world
It's a beautiful new place
Where else could a creep like me
Meet such a pretty face

Meetin' every day with the risin' sun
Lookin' up it's lookin' like
My losin' streak is done

Used to always feel like
Wished that I was dressed better
Never had a lot of luck
Until' I finally met her

Feelin' like the weight that weighed a ton
Lifted off my shoulders now
My losin' streak is done

Always felt like givin' in
To the feelin' I can't win
But I took it on the chin
Now I'm finally cashin' in

Meetin' every day with the risin' sun
Lookin' up it's lookin' like
My losin' streak is done

My losin' streak is done
I said, "My losin' streak is done"
Did you hear me?
I said, "My losin' streak is done"
