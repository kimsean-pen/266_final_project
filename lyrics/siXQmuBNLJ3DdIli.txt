Ooh, steady love
Ooh, steady love
Ooh, steady love
Ooh, steady love

The way that he looks at me
When he holds my hand
He wants everyone to know
I'm his woman and he is my man
We can talk about anything
He's got nothing to hide
He's not afraid of his feelings
He's not a slave to his pride

He's givin' me love, so steady
He touches my heart, now I'm ready
He touches my soul and my spirit
He's givin' me love, so steady
(Love me so steady)

Ooh, steady love
Ooh, steady love

I have never met a man that
I wanted to be his wife
And then he came along
It's so natural to make a life
'Cause he's a perfect compliment
'Cause I'm a boss in my world
But when we're together
He just makes me feel like his girl

He's givin' me love, so steady
He touches my heart, now I'm ready
He touches my soul and my spirit
He's givin' me love, so steady
(Love me so steady)

He puts every other man
I've ever known to shame (known to shame)
I just wanna be with him
Talk to him, sleep near him, walk with him
Be with him (every day)
I wanna be lovers and friends
And mother his children
Make breakfast on sunday and
Fight and then make up again
'Cause if life's gonna be crazy anyway
I wanna do it with him

Ooh, steady love (hey)
Ooh, oh, steady love

He's a good father, he's a good cook
He loves his basketball and
He loves a good book
I'll tell you how I know
He's the perfect one for me
'Cause he's a warrior in the streets
But he's a king in the sheets

He's givin' me love, so steady
He touches my heart, now I'm ready
He touches my soul and my spirit
He's givin' me love, so steady
He's givin' me love, so steady
