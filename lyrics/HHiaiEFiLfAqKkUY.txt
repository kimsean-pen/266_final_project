Hey Lucy, I remember your name
I left a dozen roses on your grave today
I'm in the grass on my knees, wipe the leaves away
I just came to talk for a while, got some things I need to say

Now that it's over
I just wanna hold her
I'd give up all the world to see
That little piece of heaven looking back at me

Now that it's over
I just wanna hold her
I've gotta live with the choices I made
And I can't live with myself today

Hey Lucy, I remembered your birthday
They said it'd bring some closure to say your name (To say your name)
I know I'd do it all different if I had the chance (the chance)
But all I got are these roses to give
And they can't help me make amends

Now that it's over
I just wanna hold her
I'd give up all the world to see
That little piece of heaven looking back at me

Now that it's over
I just wanna hold her
I've gotta live with the choices I made
And I can't live with myself today

Here we are, now you're in my arms
I never wanted anything so bad
Here we are for a brand new start
Living the life that we could've had

Me and Lucy walking hand in hand
Me and Lucy never wanna end
Just another moment in your eyes
I'll see you in another life in heaven
Where we never say goodbye

Now that it's over
I just wanna hold her
I'd give up all the world to see
That little piece of heaven looking back at me

Now that it's over
I just wanna hold her
I've gotta live with the choices I made
And I can't live with myself today

Here we are, now you're in my arms
Here we are for a brand new start
I got to live with the choices I've made
And I can't live with myself today

Me and Lucy walking hand in hand (Today)
Me and Lucy never wanna end
I've got to live with the choices I've made
And I can't live with myself
Today

Hey Lucy, I remember your name
