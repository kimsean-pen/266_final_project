I just sit inside in silence.
I just sit inside.

Everyone talks nicely,
But I don't think they like me,
'Cause when they go out they never invite me.
Maybe I'm too quiet,
Should I try and fight it?
I just need someone to sit beside in silence.

Everyone talks nicely,

I just need someone to sit beside in silence.
I just sit inside in silence.
I just sit inside.

I'd love to spent a day in the clouds and I,
Wish I had another day with you now,
But you're gone, I'm alone, and the music's too loud,
Go out and I'm alone in the crowd, it's all I think about.

Really never felt right there,
All the kids had mommy's money, I had waif-like hair,
Wasn't ever good at being told what to wear,
Much prefer to sit and people-watch in King George Square.
And I really wanna leave, but you tell me to say,
And there's smoke in my face.
And you say you try to stop, but couldn't handle the breaks,
Cut the ties, fuck the cuts on the thighs, now cut the cake.

And I'm left-field,
I fucking hate Westfield.
And I can't feel and I can't remember how to cartwheel.

Everyone talks nicely,
But I don't think they like me,
'Cause when they go out they never invite me.
Maybe I'm too quiet,
Should I try and fight it?
I just need someone to sit beside in silence.
I just sit inside in silence.
I just sit inside.
