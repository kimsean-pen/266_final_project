Lazy bones and no concern sees forty one mosquitoes flying in formation,
I'm alright, but my pet cockroach died of starvation.
Sleep till late, I won't mind if we do nothing today.
Come and stay, bring your friends, who needs floor space anyway?

So do you not want me to come over?
So do you not want me to come over?

Not much we know
So off we go
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh...

The other side of the land,
they like my brain,
they don't waste time
and they don't wait.
They can do what they want,
as long as I don't have to concentrate.
Broken drums, thriving dreams, not much else between these walls.
One more, I am already gone but duty calls.

Not much we know,
So off we go
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh...
