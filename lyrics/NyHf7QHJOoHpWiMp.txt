You said you didn't need her
You told her good-bye (good-bye)
You sacrificed a good love
To satisfy your pride

That you should have her (have her)
And you feel like such a fool
You let her walk away

Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that did shine at night
Whatever you do don't put the blame on you

Blame it on the rain yeah yeah
You can blame it on the rain
Should've told her you were sorry (sorry)
Could have said you were wrong

But no you couldn't do that. No, no

You had to prove you were strong ooh
If you hadn't been so blinded (blinded)
She might still be there with you
You want her back again

But she just don't feel the same
Gotta blame it on something
Gotta blame it on something
Gotta blame it on something

Blame it on the stars that did shine at night
Whatever you do don't put the blame on you

Cos the rain don't mind
And the rain don't care
