I would have given more
I tied my children to a dying horse
Stacked up against me
The bodies heaved and stank
Upon their gore
On the Earth lying still
My father found me there,
Ashamed and dying bare
I had spent many years
Destroying all around
Took everything I found

With a dying fall
His voice left him
It shouldn't be this way
Do not hope for any other
And he picked up my hand

I would have given more
They brought me misery
And they would not falter
We poured down our ratchets
Upon them day and night
With brutal force and might

To dead men and absent
There are no friends left to
Scribe the things we do

When I wake up
I want to see you
Brine me the life that is within you
I charge myself off your body
But in my arms, the darkness deepens

I'll raise my hand to break you
If I don't, another will

And my father left forever
It shouldn't be this way
I sang long psalms
of bitter verse, but
God had turned away
Men are free at the blood of Christ
I wish it was this way.

Breathing is faster
And breathing is deeper
And falling no longer bothers me
Sinking is deeper
Thinking is cleaner
Your love it flows away from me
The pool of Bethesda
beckons me closer
Put off that closing evil hour
The Devil, he is
Very ol indeed
We sit with
A few stories to tell
