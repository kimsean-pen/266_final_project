Violence and hate, an easy way
Exploding into dark tides of rage
So focused on the lies they're fed
The will of the herd takes hold

The mob will follow
They know the way
A savage force
That lives for the day

The masters serve themselves and exploit the rest
Dropping the bombs that bring discord
Deceptive agendas behind it all
And we're all left to suffer

The mob will follow
They know the way
Bring them forth
And set them free

Dragged and pulled by destructive currents
A sobering motion, so primal
A lifetime of venom comes pouring out
That lives, dies, and thrives in the moment

A faceless torrent of lost humanity
Anonymous masses collide with thunder
The blood runs red and soaks the ground
Warm and pure it feeds the beast

This beast of bodies out of control
Thirst for blood drives its collective soul
Throw them the scraps and watch them feed
Ravaging all within their reach

Panic justifies its purpose
Momentum builds to a lawless collapse
This force of nature erupts in chaos
Lost in their emotional surge

The mob will follow
They know the way
A vicious force
That brings down the day

Dragged and pulled by destructive currents
A sobering motion, so primal
A lifetime of venom comes pouring out
That lives, dies, and thrives in the moment
