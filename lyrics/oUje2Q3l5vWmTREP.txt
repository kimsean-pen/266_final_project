I was only asking
If you'd walk with me tonight
But we put it past the cast and the straight line for a smile

Did I leave this too long now
Did I tie my tie too late?
But I got no time on my hands
But I got a lot on my plate

So forget it you got a lot to learn
You got a lot to learn
The luck has gone and it left me
So I wait my turn
Yeah I wait my turn

Shake me up and take me
For everything you see
'Cause Friday night will break me
If it leaves me in one piece

So did I leave it too long now
Did I tie my tie too late?
And I'm a million miles away
From the things I'd like to say

So forget it you got a lot to learn
You got a lot to learn
The luck has gone and it left me
So I wait my turn
Yeah I wait my turn

So forget it you got a lot to learn
You got a lot to learn
The luck has gone and it left me
So I wait my turn
Yeah I wait my turn
