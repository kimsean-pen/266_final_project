Believe
When you lie
You will never need to
Recognize yourself
To deceive
To remove all chance of
Doubt and be received
With your lie

The deception is complete
When you concede
And decide
To reject your lives,
Sacrificed to me
Penance can't absolve your sin
Into me
Penance can't absolve your sin

All your belief
Cannot absolve your sin
All your belief
Cannot absolve your sin
Believe
When you lie
You will never need to
Recognize the source
Of deceit

To renew your
Faith in God
You must believe,
In your lie
The redemption is
Complete when you conceive
And decline
To release your lives

Sacrificed to me
Penance can't absolve your sin

Into me
Penance can't absolve your sin

All your belief
Cannot absolve your sin
All your belief
Cannot absolve your sin
Reap your life,
Like you want to

Recognize,
All you've come to

Reap your life,
Like you want to
Recognize,
All you've come to
Reap your life
Veiled in shadow
Recognize
Faces of the crucified
I can hear their
Screams tonight
Ever haunting me
Burn your lie
Into me
Penance can't absolve your sin
Into me
Penance can't absolve your sin
All your belief
Cannot absolve your sin
All your belief
Cannot absolve your sin
