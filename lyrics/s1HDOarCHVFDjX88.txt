Picture yourself in a tangle with another
You feel your body awaken
Your skin is sh-sh-sh-shaking
Your love needed making
Pictures mean nothing when you find your own lover
And I'm talking skin on skin
That kind of skin that you're in, boy
That kind that's been where you've been

You, you, you...
You, you...
Cause I'm tired of seeing pictures on a screen
I'm tired of picturing love
Picturing love, picturing love, picturing love
I'm tired of picturing love
Picturing love, picturing love, picturing love
I'm tired of picturing love

When I wear, wear my hair
It's a man's world fantasy
I undress in seven steps
Like your camera's watching me
I suppose I'll strike a pose
But that's so predictable
I undress in seven steps because
We can't stop our

Picturing love, picturing love, picturing love
Cause I'm tired of picturing love
Picturing love, picturing love, picturing love
I'm tired of picturing love

In the screen I see a woman
Dancing to my expectations
A tired fantasy
Isn't this what you wanted?
Am I turning you on yet?
I don't know how to be
With all these eyes on me

You, you...
Someone like you, you, you...
Picturing love
Picturing love, picturing love, picturing love
I'm tired of picturing love
Picturing love, picturing love, picturing love
I'm tired of picturing love
Picturing love, picturing love, picturing love
I'm tired of picturing love
Picturing love, picturing love, picturing love
I'm tired of picturing love
