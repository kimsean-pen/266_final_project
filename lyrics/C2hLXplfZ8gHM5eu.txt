Time slips away
And I lose another day
But I try not to wish
For anything but this

I know
Full circle comes around
To go
Don't feed the underground

'Cause they never hurt you, no
So I take it real slow baby
Now, now, now
They never hurt you, no
But everything goes baby
Wow, wow, wow

'Cause they never hurt you, no
So I take it real slow baby
Now, now, now
They never hurt you, no
But everything goes baby
Wow, wow, wow

We're all on our way
To that world beyond our days
If we walk in the sun
We'll have peace when it's done

I know
Full circle comes around
To go
Don't feed the underground

'Cause they never hurt you, no
So I take it real slow baby
Now, now, now
They never hurt you, no
But everything goes baby
Wow, wow, wow

'Cause they never hurt you, no
So I take it real slow baby
Now, now, now
They never hurt you, no
But everything goes baby
Wow, wow, wow

Baby wow, wow, wow
Baby wow, wow, wow

So when time slips away
All the love that I gave
Will be left on the walls
And I'll live after all

'Cause they never hurt you, no
So I take it real slow baby
Now, now, now
They never hurt you, no
(Never)
But everything goes baby
Wow, wow, wow

'Cause they never hurt you, no
(You know)
So I take it real slow baby
Now, now, now
They never hurt you, no
(You know)
But everything goes baby
Wow, wow, wow
