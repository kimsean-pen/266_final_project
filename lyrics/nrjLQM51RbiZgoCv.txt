I got you and that's all I need
I got you and that's all I need
I got you and that's all I need
I got you

I got you and I still believe
That you're all that I ever need
It's you

All
All way back in the seventies
You were my little T.V. queen
You're Tarzan and friend Janine

I got you
I got you and I still believe
That you're all that I'll ever need
It's you
All

It's the end of the century
I can't think of anything
Except you
It's the end of the century
And I can't think of anything
But you

All
All
I
Need

I got you
I got you, babe
I got you, you
I got you
I got you
I got you
