Got to think of something elase to say
Get the question every pill, every day
Guess I am a clich√©
I can't sleep, so on i play

Got to find another place to stay
Stop the clock, and be on my way
I can't sleep, so up I stay
No I can't sleep, so on I play

I am a refugee
You can not rescue me
I am a refugee
Chopping down the family tree

I can't talk about the names I like
I'm still very much in love with the night
I guess I'm gonna let fate decide
Is it the ultimate love or the final fight

I'm not here to wait and see
I'm afraid you love another refugee
Refugee

I am a refugee
You can not rescue me
I am a refugee
Chopping down the family tree

I am a refugee
You can not rescue me
I am a refugee
You can not rescue me

I am a refugee
You can not rescue me
I am a refugee
Chopping down the family tree
