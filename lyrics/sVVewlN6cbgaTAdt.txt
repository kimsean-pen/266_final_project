Cold seems crippling
Lame meander through corridors
Aroma's thick with age
Mark off the day
Reflections of my life are fading
Pull me out your body
Don't want it, don't want in
Feeble frail and rotting
Descending
I'm lost in
A structure that's collapsing
Don't want it
Cast into
Maker take the body
Don't want it
It wants me
Past has found it's place
Salvation is no more
Will God accept my peace
Bleached will pardon me
Reflections of my life are fading
Pull me out your body
Don't want it, don't want in
Feeble frail and rotting descending
I'm lost in
A structure that's collapsing
Don't want it
Cast into
Maker take the body
Don't want it
It wants me
I just want to run around
Fly kites
Wrestle
Jump and play
Swim through waves that crash
To shore
Memories in me
Cocooned in misery
I'm sick... And tired...
Of embracing reflections of past time
Receive me or cast me away
God please take me away
Resistance... Futile...
Suicidal ideas
I will crucify my own being
Satisfy selfish needs, fuck the deities
Justify my own right to what's waiting for me
On the other side of me
The time has come
Lock and load
I'm coming
I'm coming
I'm coming
I'm coming home
Pull me out of the body
Don't want it, don't want in
Pull me out of the body
Don't want it, don't want in
Pull me out your body
Don't want it, don't want in
Feeble frail and rotting
Descending
I'm lost in
A structure that's collapsing
Descending
Don't want it
Maker take the body
Don't want it, don't want in
Pull me out your body
Don't want it, don't want in
Feeble frail and rotting
Descending
I'm lost in
A structure that's collapsing
Descending
Don't want it
Maker take the body
Don't want it
It wants me
I just want to run around
Fly kites
Wrestle
Jump and play
Swim through waves that crash
To shore
Memories in me
Cocooned in misery
The darkness overcomes
Soul soars to the other plain
Existence past
The door
I sail
Through purgatory's bay
I asked a god for poison cradle me
Sown to my dreams
Souls searching
Death blossoms where clouds lie over me
Held in God's hands
Death blooming...
Dark for fear of failure
An inner gloom as wide as an eye and fermenting
Roiling hate...
Death gripped my veins
Unveiling rancid petals
Flowering forth foul nectar
The space between a blink and a tear...
Death blooms.
