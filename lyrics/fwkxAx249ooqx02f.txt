Fujiya, Miyagi x26

As I pretty
As of the band
Lowercase letter S
Spray painted red
It's spray painted red
Yeah, your little arms
Swing on monkey bars
In search of your plot
Like pixelated scraps of chess mats in your head
Lights

Like pixelated scraps of chess mats in your head
Lights, a career
Littered with, ankle injuries
In the mid to late 1980s
As you're pretty
As of the band
Lowercase letter S
Like pixelated scraps of chess mats in your head
Lights

Like pixelated scraps of chess mats in your head
Watching
Unleashing begins
Next to zen, road crossings
My ancient old legs, stick to leather and
Seat coverings
Watching
Unleashing begins
Through transparent things
Like pixelated scraps of chess mats in your head
Lights

Like pixelated scraps of chess mats in your head
Lights

Fujiya, Miyagi x34

Like pixelated scraps of chess mats in your head
Lights
