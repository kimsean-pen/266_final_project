If I stall at all or hesitate
The world of always never seems to wait
A comedy that could be so divine
Never is a long time
A shadow born to steal the light of day

You woke me up and said come on let's play
Well now I know that never has... it's way
You are, you are the star i say
From far, from far, from far away
The laws that cause it all to stay
By you, by you, by you, by you, for you, I do
I thought I'd done it all, I thought I knew

But nothing ever looked as good as you
Now every never that I knew was fine
Never is a long time
And now I share this feeling with my dad
Stolen goods aren't always half that bad
The never that we'll always wonder what the star will say

From far, from far, from far away
The laws that caused it all to stay by you, by you
By you, by you
The faded piping on your press, will always have its place I guess,
By you, by you
A common love, that we can bless the pleasure of my child's mess
Golden books and tenderness, have rescued me from emptiness
You are, you are the star i say
From far, from far, from far away
The laws that cause it all to stay
You are, you are, the star i say
From far, from far, from far away, it all, it all, it all to stay
