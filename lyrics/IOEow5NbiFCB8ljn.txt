A reoccurring dream
Of you and me on the train
Knee caps to knee caps
My hands placed over your palms
And we ride end to end
Until we cry enough to
Make the river rise
And we drown
You haunt my sleep
Called me weeping choked on your tears
Chattering through shattered teeth
And i know it's lucid, but it seems so real when you come to me
And you say "You haunt me, and we meet in your dreams."
I know it's lucid but it seems so real when you come to me and you say "you haunt me, and we meet in your sleep"
But I know it's just a dream
