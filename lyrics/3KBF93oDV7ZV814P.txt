You only call me
When you need something
I need to be free
Time to spread my wings

I don't like bitches
All that nonsense got get back with ya
Don't got time for snitches
You're pulling me down but you was my sister

My strings, propagate through space and time
Here and there at the same time
Handing mitches and basic rhyme
Yo ain't gotta be mad
Look deeper, go higher when you climb
But stay outta my path
Stay outta my flight path

Never feelin' lonely only gliding, flying
Always feeling' constantly reminded
Time is running out don't waste your luck
Sucker, this is my life
Don't mix this up

This is my life, don't block the sun
This is my seat, can't you tell
This is my time, don't waste it up
This is my land, not for sale

Dry desert air blowing' through my hair
As we blow through the square, we don't even care
Dirt roads and bare feet
Tied to memories so sweet
Mesmerized men at my feet
Let's go to the top
Just you and me
As the sun highs, the fall takes over
As common African November

Don't wait for me summer (oh)
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me summer (no)
Don't wait for me

My strings, propagate through space and time
Here and there at the same time
Handing mitches and basic rhyme
Yo ain't gotta be mad
Look deeper, go higher when you climb
But stay outta my path
Stay outta my flight path

Never feelin' lonely only gliding, flying
Always being constantly reminded
Time is running out don't waste your luck
Sucker, this is my life
Don't mix that up

This is my life, don't block the sun
This is my seat, can't you tell
This is my time, don't waste it up
This is my land, not for sale
