Gimme strength
Don't give me grief
I don't wanna break or mend your beliefs
I wanna hear ya, hear ya
And keep my mind free
I'm not gonna judge ya
I hope you don't judge me

Tell me do you feel an angel's honor
Has given you the right
To impose the what and here's why
How to live their lives
Whoever you may be
Whatever will come of life
It's you who holds your life
It's up to you whether you hide it, or let it shine

We are who we are
Love us, don't move on
Don't you know that there's a star
Guiding everyone
We are who we are
Love us, don't move on
Don't you know that there's a star
Guiding everyone

Speak of solution, you can keep your problems
I hate your opinion
And yes we've all, yes, we've all got 'em
Somebody's trash is somebody's treasure
Somebody's laugh is somebody's pain
Somebody's loss is somebody's gain

It don't matter what car you drive
Or whatever sound you like
It don't matter if you praying to God
Or trust in Mother Nature's stride

What's true to you and I
Maybe won't be right
For another kinda life
Can't we agree to disagree
And we can be happy

We are who we are
Love us, don't move on
Don't you know that there's a star
Guiding everyone
We are who we are
Love us, don't move on
Don't you know that there's a star
Guiding everyone
We are who we are

We should be able to say what we think
And make love at the end of the day
We should be able to step outta sync
And fall back in our own kinda way
It's okay if you don't wanna see
It's okay if you disagree
So reach inside of yourself
And realize that you're one of a kind
And all that you are is just fine
Know that you're you, and not me
Free to fly, free to fall
Free to live a loveless live, it's up to you
If you don't know what to do with yourself
Just breathe

We are who we are
(Yes we are)
Love us, don't move on
Don't you know that there's a star
Guiding everyone
(Don't you know, don't you know)
We are who we are
(Yes we are)
Love us, don't move on
Don't you know that there's a star
Guiding everyone
(Don't you know, don't you know)
We are who we are
Love us, don't move on
Don't you know that there's a star
Guiding everyone
We are who we are

Me, me, me, m-me
We are who we are
Me, me, me, m-me
We are who we are
Me
