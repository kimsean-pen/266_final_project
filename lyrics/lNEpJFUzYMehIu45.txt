In the afterglow, the bond remains unbroken when young hearts have been awoken.
Just follow the light.

This distance, it doesn't matter to us
Standing by, waiting for our stories to be told

We hold.
We hold the unbroken bond no matter how old we are.
Together we are the fireflies.
We hold the light.
We burn so bright.
We are the stars that shine even in the darkest night

We hold the light.
We burn so bright.
We are the stars that shine even in the darkest night

This distance, it doesn't matter to us.
Standing by, waiting for our stories to be told

We hold
We hold the unbroken bond no matter how old we are.
Together in the afterglow the bond remains unbroken,
when young hearts have been awoken.
Just follow the light

Can you hear the voices calling you to the shadows?
Can you feel the reaper pulling you to the gallows?

We hold the light.
We burn so bright.
We are the stars that shine even in the darkest night

We hold the light.
We burn so bright.
We are the stars that shine even in the darkest night

Can you hear the voices calling you to the shadows?
Can you feel the reaper pulling you to the gallows?
