Ooh baby, I love your way, everyday yeah, yeah
Ooh, baby, I love your way, everyday

Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away, from the city
But don't, oh no, hesitate
'Cause your love just won't wait (Hey yeah, yeah)

Ooh baby, I love your way, everyday
I wanna tell you I love your way, everyday yeah, yeah
I wanna be with you night and day

The moon appears to shine and light the skies
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
I can see them under the pine
But don't, oh no no, hesitate, la di dah
'Cause your love, just won't wait (Hey yeah, yeah)

Ooh baby, I love your way, everyday
I wanna tell you I love your way, everyday (Hey yeah)
I wanna be with you night and day (Whoa baby, oh baby please)

Everyday yeah, yeah
I would love, I would love ya
I love your way (Oh baby please)

I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and grey and blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one out of season
But don't, oh no no, hesitate, la di dah
'Cause your love just won't wait, just won't wait

Ooh baby, I love your way (Every, everyday)
I wanna tell you I love your way
(I wanna tell you how I love your little ways)
I wanna be with you night and day (Everyday, in every way)

Ooh baby, I love your way (Ooh baby how I love your little ways, yeah)
I wanna tell you I love your way (I wanna tell you how I)
(I wanna tell you how I love your little ways)
I wanna be with you night and day
Ooh baby, I love your way (Ooh, baby, baby)
