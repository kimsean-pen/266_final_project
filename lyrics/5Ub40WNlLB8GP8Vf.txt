The heart is the organ of desire
Forget my mind, my talents and my mighty pride
You'll find me where I do not exist
I suppose it would have been easier if I tried to say

Feel me
Touch me
Look at me
Hold me
Kiss me
Marry me

To weep is part of the normal activity
Of the amorous body where I live
Passion is in essence made to be seen
Let me show you just how little you mean to me

Every passion will have a spectator
All-encompassing, sooner or later

Feel me
Touch me
Look at me
Hold me
Kiss me
Marry me

Every passion will have a spectator
All-encompassing, sooner or later
Every passion will have a spectator
All-encompassing, sooner or later

Somehow I will communicate
Some of the overwhelming
Undying, overpowering
Unconditional, all-encompassing
Heart-enriching, mind-expanding
On-going, never-ending love I have for you

Feel me
Touch me
Look at me
Hold me
Kiss me
Marry me
