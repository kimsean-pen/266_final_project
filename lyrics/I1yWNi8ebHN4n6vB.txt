The sky is red
Them voices in my head
Kill 'em in the shed
I'm scared a nigga dead
The sky is red
Them voices in my head
Kill 'em in the shed
I'm scared a nigga dead
The sky is red
Them voices in my head
Kill 'em in the shed
I'm scared a nigga dead
The sky is red
Them voices in my head
Kill 'em in the shed
I'm scared a nigga dead
The sky is red
Them voices in my head
Creeping out the shed
Kill 'em in the shed
Creeping, creeping out the shed
I'm scared a nigga dead

Creeping out the shed, gun in hand, time to make a stain
Cock it back and put the lead, grrah grrah, let it rain
Overdosing rookies, I'm the bookie for the fucking Devil
Jacket full of metal, in the flames where the $carecrow meddle
Every time I smoke on the dope 'til my lungs choke
$licky keep that rope on my throat, hanging off the oak
Bodies in the river, feeling bitter with a spotted liver
Send a killer quitter, pull the trigger on the fucking mirror

The sky is red
Them voices in my head
Kill 'em in the shed
I'm scared a nigga dead
The sky is red
Them voices in my head
Coughing up my lungs
Kill 'em in the shed
I'm scared a nigga dead

I be coughing up my lungs, gotta problem with them blunts
You know Ruby never fucked witcha, I never sold no drugs
I ain't worried about money, I don't want to feel numb
That's why I'm holding up this gun
Don't need protection from no one
That's my escape route, pull the plug
Ruby suicidal, I know $lick is suicidal
Bitch, I'm guiding my disciples right out of this fucking cycle
Bitch just grab that fucking rifle
Aim between their fucking eyes
So they just wait for the revival
Dial 666 on my phone, hoe
