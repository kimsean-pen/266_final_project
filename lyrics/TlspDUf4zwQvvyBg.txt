Come in out of the rain thou sayest -
but thou ne'er stept'st aside
And I am trapp'd - A Distance There Is...
None, save me and the bodkin - pitter-patter on the roof
Behold! - 'tis not the rain; thence me it has to be -
I will not drink thy vintage wine, my dear
Thou hast heed'd that I am of innocecne
Yet thou let'st thy lass into peril -
Thou let'st me be parched
My heart, my heart, my heart...

My heart, my heart, my heart...
My heart is of frailty, my pale skin is hued damask.
When thou thy tears hast hidden
"Come back!" thou sayest - There I soon am to be -
But how am I to run when my bones, my heart
Thou hast me bereaft - But run thou sayest
I run, i run, i run...

I run, i run, i run...

I run, i run, i run...

I run, i run, i run...

I run, i run, i run...
I run - And there and then I behold
that a time will come when I again dead will be.
Thou tell'st me to leave without delay -
I leave with my bodkin and my tears in my hands
Lo! - the shadows, the sky - descending
So by a dint of smite I gait ere I run and melt together with dusk.
In my mind in which is this event
But it seems as if naught is to change anyway?!
After all these years thou left'st me down in the emotional depths -
The sombre soaked velvet-drape is hung upon me
Turning my feelings away from our so ignorant world
All the beautiful moments shared, deliberately push'd aside -
After all these years thou left'st me down in the emotional depths -
