Are you ready?
Yeah

Hey hey hey hey (Hey hey hey hey)
Hey hey hey hey (Hey hey hey hey)
Hey (Hey), Hey (Hey)
Hey (Hey), Hey (Hey)

Everybody's looking at that perfect little seat
Because we all want the chair beside the prettiest girl
We all got eyes upon the number one spot
She's the prettiest girl in class

Ah ha everyone's a rival
Ah ha every man for himself
Yeah yeah yeah

Goddess of fortune
Please won't you smile at me
â€˜Cause I depend on you
And if it doesn't work
I'm gonna be a bad boy-oy-oy-oy-oy-oy-oy

Even all the nerds and the leader of the brats
Are a-waiting and a-wondering which seat it will be
We all got eyes upon the number one spot
She's the prettiest girl in class

Hey hey hey hey (Hey hey hey hey)
Hey hey hey hey (Hey hey hey hey)
Hey (Hey), Hey (Hey)
Hey (Hey), Hey (Hey)

Everybody's looking at that perfect little seat
Because we all want the chair beside the prettiest girl
We all got eyes upon the number one spot
She's the prettiest girl in class

Ah ha if she looks at me
Ah ha from the side of my face
Yeah yeah yeah

I am in paradise
All through the lesson
Forget my home work
If you won't give me joy
I'm gonna be bad boy-oy-oy-oy-oy-oy-oy

Even all the nerds and the leader of the brats
Are a-waiting and a-wondering which seat it will be
We all got eyes upon the number one spot
She's the prettiest girl in class
