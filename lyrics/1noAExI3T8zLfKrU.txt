All I do is dream of you the whole night through
With the dawn
I still go on dreamin' of you
You're every thought

You're everything
You're every song I ever sing
Summer, winter, autumn and spring.
And were there more
Than twenty-four hours in a day

They'd be spent in sweet content

Just dreamin' away

When skies are gray
When skies are blue
Morning, noon and nighttime too
All I do the whole day through
Is dream of you...
When skies are gray
Even when that blue...
And were there more
Than twenty-four hours in a day
They'd be spent in sweet content
Dreamin' away
Oh when skies are gray
When skies are blue
In the morning
All I do the whole day through
Is dream of you...
