I won't give it back again
I won't give it back to you
I won't give that part again
I won't love another you

'Cause honey that eyeglass got me thinkin'
You ain't no friend of mine
And I'm movin' so fast that you got me thinkin'
Why not keep chasin' time?
Honey I wanna find somewhere sacred
Away from your flashin' lights
Honey I was yours in the dark of the night
Come as you are
Come let me take a picture
Come as you are

I won't give it back again
More that I'm givin', the more you take
Feelin' forced into the intimate
With every move I make into your frame

Come on, take anything you like
Come on, take anything you like
Come on, take anything you like
Come on, take anything you like

'Cause honey that eyeglass got me thinkin'
You ain't no friend of mine
We were movin' so fast and the sand was sinkin'
Why not keep chasin' time?
Honey I wanna feel something sacred
Away from your flashin' lights
Honey I was yours in the dark of the night
Come as you are
Come let me take a picture
Come as you are

Come inside, a little to the right
Get comfortable, you're a natural
Come inside, it'll be alright

Love comes at a cost, nothing's ever lost
Just another paradox
And dark was never just for us
Takin' all the falls, try and make it last
But it's too, my love shall pass
The dark was never just for us

And it all ends the same
'Cause in time, everything must change
Take another fast, try to make it last if you want to
But in time, everything must go
