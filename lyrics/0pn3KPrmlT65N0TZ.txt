Now you get the tune
Hold your body next to mine
If you're feeling so inclined
She said don't you take it slow
Put your finger to my chest
And I'll tell you who's the best

She said
Show a sweet reminder
Custom melody that was in my mind
She said
Show a sweet reminder
Of a melody that was in my mind

She could be your invitation
Takes you places
You don't even know
If I'm just a pedal pusher
Guess that's just the way I always roll

Now you're feeling fine
Hold your body next to mine
If you're feeling so inclined

She said
Show a sweet reminder
Custom melody that was in my mind
Show a sweet reminder
Of a melody that was in my mind

She could be your invitation
Takes you places
You don't even know
If I'm just a pedal pusher
Guess that's just the way I always roll

She could be your invitation
Takes you places
You don't even know
If I'm just a pedal pusher
Yes that's just the way I always roll

(I always roll)
(She said, she said)
