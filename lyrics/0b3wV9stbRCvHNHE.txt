Oh, young like you, boy
Don't you say goodbye, just take my hand now
And if we stay, taking the crown
We let no feeling die until the sun is out

We ain't gonna get no sleep
We ain't gonna get no
We ain't gonna get no sleep
We ain't gonna get no
Not right now

Oh, cotton candy sky
We stay up all night
We build a world up high, oh
You'll be you, I'll be me for a while
Even though we change
Our heartbeat is the same
Pretending is the same
Pretending I'm okay, oh
'Cause there's else to do

Oh, I'm young like you, boy
I'm anxious and my fears are in control now
I suck at life, I'm chasing alone
A world that's slowly running out of love, boy

We ain't gonna get no sleep
We ain't gonna get no
We ain't gonna get no sleep
We ain't gonna get no
Not right now

Oh, cotton candy sky
We stay up all night
We build a world up high, oh
You'll be you, I'll be me for a while
Even though we change
Our heartbeat is the same
Pretending is the same
Pretending I'm okay, oh
'Cause there's else to do

Nothing, nothing, nothing
There's nothing else to do
We both know we might end up alone
We have each other
We bot know we might not make it home
Only each other

Oh, cotton candy sky
We stay up all night
We build a world up high, oh
You'll be you, I'll be me for a while
Even though we change
Our heartbeat is the same
We will be okay, oh
There's nothing we can't do
