You sit alone in a midnight haze
Can you hear my love?
A million voices rack your brain
Can you hear my love?
I wanna give you everything
Can you hear my love?
Signal's lost, we got cut off
Can you hear my love?

Focus on my voice
Gotta let me through
Gotta get to you
Turn down all the noise
Focus on me
Focus on you

Can you hear my love?
Can you hear my love?
You're in a war against yourself tonight
Can you hear my love?

Over the smoke and the battle cries
Can you hear my love?
I'm on your side and I will fight
Can you hear my love?
Transmission lost, yeah we got cut off
Can you hear my love?
Focus on my voice
Gotta let me through

Gotta get to you
Turn down all the noise
Focus on me
Focus on you
Can you hear my love?
Can you hear my love?

Through the static is it clear enough
I'll sing louder so you hear my love
Tunnel vision is it clear enough
I'll scream louder so you'd hear my love
Can you hear my love?
Focus on my voice
Gotta let me through
Gotta get to you
Turn down all the noise
Focus on me
Focus on you
Can you hear my love?
Can you hear my love?
Can you hear me babe?
