Show up in the same dress
We don't know who wore it best
Not make a big deal
Act like it's a new trend
Look good when we go round here
Try on these boots
I found this boy who said you're sweet
He's got a best friend
(Will you always be mine?)

I'm a better me
When you're here next to me
I'll JK can't you tell
We're ROTFFL
Who needs words when we got hearts, smile
T-t-t-time goes by so fast
But we are meant to last
(Will you always be mine?)
