When you're smiling
When you're smiling
Oh, the whole world, it smiles with you

When you're laughing
Babe, when you're laughing
Well the sun comes shining through
But when you're crying
You know you bring on the rain
Stop that sighing
Be happy again

Keep on smiling
'Cause when you're smiling
Oh, the whole world smiles with you
(Oh, let's go girls)

'Cause when you're crying
You bring on the rain
Stop that sighing
Be happy again

Keep on smiling
'Cause when you're smiling
Oh, the whole world smiles with you

When you're smiling (When you're smiling)
When you're smiling (Keep on smiling)
Oh, the whole world smiles with you
When you're laughing (Keep on smiling now)
When you're laughing (You'll get through somehow)
Oh, the sun comes shining through (When I'm with you)
But when you're crying
You know you bring on the rain
Stop that sighing
Come on, be happy again

Keep smiling
When you're smiling, baby
The whole world it smiles with you
The whole world it smiles with you
