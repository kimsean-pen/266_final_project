I see how you're tryin to
Weasel your way and boy I
Know how you maneuver
With all your confusion

You tell me that I'm your only,
And how bad that you want me
Then why are you so shady,
If I'm supposed to be your lady?

Why should I believe
Anything you say?
And how could you shame me that way?

Tell me where,
Where'd you get the nerve
To even think that you,
You could play me boy?

You thought that we didn't know
You thought we were in the dark
But boy your cover's blown
Cuz we both know now
You thought you had us both
At your beck 'n call
But now who's the joke?
And look who's laughin' now

Now you're tryin to use us, a

Against one another but it won't work

I see right through your game boy

And I know exactly what a lame ya' are

You, you try to deny all your actions

For once in your life be a real man

At least give me the proper respect of

The truth

When I already know you did it

Why should I believe
Anything you say?
And how could you shame me that way?

Tell me where
Where'd you get the nerve
To even think that you
You could play me boy

You thought we didn't know
You thought we were in the dark
But boy your cover's blown
Cuz we both know now
You that you had us both
At you beck 'n call
But now who's the joke?
And look who's laughin' now

I see what you do baby
Tryin' to tell me you want me
Can't you just get it through your,
Get it through your thick head?
Cuz I've seen this game before
And I'm showin' you the door so
Shut your mouth
I'm not tryin to hear your lies
No not again

No, no not again...

Sorry you couldn't be a better man
Oh...
No no no

No, no, no, no, NO
You thought we didn't know
You thought we were in the dark
But boy your cover's blown
Cuz we both know now
You thought you had us both
At your beck 'n call
But now who's the joke?
And look who's laughin' now

Guess you thought wrong

Look who's laughin' now
