Girl you are to me
All that a woman should be
And I dedicate my life
To you always

A love like yours is rare
It must have been sent from up above
And I know you'll stay this way
For always

And we both know
That our love will grow
And forever
It will be you and me

Ooh, your like the sun
Chasing all the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days

You're the perfect one
For me, and you forever will be
And I will love you so
For always

Come with me, my sweet
Let's go make a family
And they will bring us joy
For always

Oh boy, I love you so
I can't find enough ways to let you know
But you can be sure I'll know
For always

And we both know
That our love will grow
And forever it will be
You and me

Ooh, your like the sun
Chasing all the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days

You're the perfect one
For me, and you forever will be
And I will love you so
For always

Ooh, you're like the sun
Chasing all of the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days

You're the perfect one
For me, and you forever will be
And I will love you so
For always

Oo-oo-oo-oo
I will love you so
For always
