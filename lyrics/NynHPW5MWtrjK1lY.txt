She says nobody wants her,
But left along
She said nobody needs her
Girl, you are
Well, if you see her
Tell her there is room for her
In my arms, in my arms
You don't have to go, you should know
(I know, I know)
I'll be there for you, when you're alone
(I do, I do)
To comfort you
Oh, baby please come where it's warm
In my arms, in my arms

Darling, you should know
I'd be your world
The blanket when it's cold baby
I'll be your sunshine
When you talk
Cling to me girl
And you will never fall
Whatever you need
All you gotta do is call.

She says nobody wants her,
But left along
She said nobody needs her
Girl, you are
Well, if you see her
Tell her there is room for her
In my arms, in my arms
You don't have to go, you should know
(I know, I know)
I'll be there for you, when you're alone
(I do, I do)
To comfort you
Oh, baby please come where it's warm
In my arms, in my arms
