When we're living under midnight
Lights shimmer off the walls
These feelings rise into the sky
Our fears faded with the twilight
Our tears mingle as we fall
In moonlight this love is amplified

In stereo
We both let go
Into the flow
You and I will ride the afterglow

The last traces of the sunlight
They wish us their last farewell
The streetlights lit up like fireflies
The faint glow of distant starlight
Keep the secrets that we tell
Our bodies' vibrations multiply

In stereo
We both let go
Into the flow
You and I will ride the afterglow
Beneath the dome
So far from home
In monochrome
You and I will ride the afterglow

(You and, you and I)
(You and, you and I)
(-glow, you and, you and)
(-glow, ride, you)
Two shadows in the moonlight
Two bodies parallel
We're lost in the datastream tonight

(You and I will ride the afterglow)

In stereo
We both let go
Into the flow
You and I will ride the afterglow
Beneath the dome
So far from home
In monochrome
You and I will ride the afterglow

(In stereo)
(We both let go)
(Into the flow)
(You and I will ride the afterglow)
(Beneath the dome)
(So far from home)
(In monochrome)
(You and I will ride the afterglow)
(You and I will ride the afterglow)
