I woke up,
in the middle of the night
I called out
I called your name

Patiently, patiently

I called out
Why do I dream so often
of his body when
his body will decay
His flesh will be fluorescent grey
His flesh will be fluorescent grey

Patiently, patiently

You were my god
You were my god
in high school
People never
really know

Patiently, Patiently
