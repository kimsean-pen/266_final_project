I wanted to be like you eh
I wanted everything
So I tried to be like you
And I got swept away
I didn't know that it was so cold and
You needed someone to show you the way
So I took your hand and we figured out that
When the tide comes I'd take you away

If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares ya

I'm sinking slowly
So hurry hold me
Your hand is all I have to keep me hanging on
Please, can you tell me?
So I can finally see
Where you go when you're gone

If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares

All you wanted was somebody who cares
If you need me you know I'll be there, yeah
Oh, oh, whoa, yeah

If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here (I can take you away)
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares ya
If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here (I can take you away)
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares ya
Can you tell me?
So I can finally see
Where you go when you're gone
