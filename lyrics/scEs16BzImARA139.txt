There walked a lonely man
Silent, mute, the only man
Not knowing how not knowing why
Was he the sole survivor
Why should he be alive
Breathing still while others died?
And the only question
Why was he the sole survivor?

Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night
Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night

Wind blew across the sand
He stood alone, he had no plan
And with the last rays of the sun
He screamed aloud began to run
In his tears he sees his face
"I am the end of the human race
When I'm gone there'll be no trace
For I'm the sole survivor"

Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night
Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night

One night when years had passed
The sky shook from a fiery blast
And there a starship, saved at last
To come rescue this survivor
They beckoned him inside
But only man, he would not ride
Instead he found a place to hide
For he's the sole survivor

Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night
Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night

Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night
Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night

Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night
Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night

Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night
Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night
