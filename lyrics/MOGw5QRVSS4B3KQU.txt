All of these ghost towns
I keep traveling through
All of these traffic signs
And lonesome bars blindsiding me and

I swear I can be better
I could be more to you
But there are things that line my path
That I just had to do

If you've got visions of the past
Let them follow you down
For they'll come back to you some day
And I found myself attached to this railroad track
But I'll come back to you some day

To you
To you
To you
Some day

And I remember how you told me
All that you wanted to do
That dream of Paris in the morning
Or a New York window view

I can see it now you're married
And your wife is with a child
And you're all laughing in the garden
And I'm lost somewhere in your mind

If you've got visions of the past
Let them follow you down
For they'll come back to you some day
And I found myself attached to this railroad track
But I'll come back to you some day

To you
To you
To you
Some day

Maybe I should just turn around and walk away
For no matter how much I really do want to stay
You know I can't, no, it's too late

For I've found myself attached to this railroad track
But I'll come back to you some day

To you
To you
To you
Some day
