First you let him in your bed.
Now he's moved inside your head.
And he directs all the dreams you are dreaming.
I saw a friend of yours today,
she called me over just to say,
"I dunno if you've seen her lately but God she's looking rough".

No don't go round to see him tonight,
he's already made such a mess of your life.
Find something else to do with your time,
and do it quickly while you've still got the chance.

Do you think he'll fall apart?
Do you think you'll break his heart?
If you leave him on his own.
You are dreaming.
Cos he can fasten all his clothes,
tie his laces,
blow his nose.
It's time to teach him how to walk,
yeah, teach your baby how to walk away.

No don't go round to see him tonight,
he's already made such a mess of your life.
Find something else to do with your time,
and do it quickly while you've still got the chance.

You're not his mother,
you're not sister & brother.
He's not even your lover.
He's just a piece of luggage you should throw away.

No don't go round to see him tonight,
he's already made such a mess of your life.
Find something else to do with your time,
and do it quickly while you've still got the chance.

No don't go round tonight,
you'll never make it right.
He's already made such a mess of your life.
Find something else to do with your time,
and do it quickly while you've still got the chance.
