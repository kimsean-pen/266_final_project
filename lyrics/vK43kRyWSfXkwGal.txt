There's a light in the dark
I found my peace in the art

Now you've found your home
Tripping off every breath that I take
From when you were lost
Backing away now I'm backing away
Take my mind off these anxious vibes
Take my voice give me peace and quiet
No faith no space

Give me something
Something that's more than just words
With some feeling

Run away from the earth
And now leave me alone with the dirt
Run away you've got the nerve
Baby maybe it's all that we're worth
Take my mind off these anxious vibes
Take my voice give me peace and quiet
No faith no space

Give me something
Something that's more than just words
With some feeling

What happened to forever
What happened to you and I sticking together
Give me more

Give me something
With some feeling
Give me something to believe in
Give me something with some meaning
Give me something
