I wanna come over
I wanna come over
And tear this place apart, with you
In the arms of another
A two hearted spider
I'm just a mess for you

Oh my naivety
Oh my fickled views
I feel my blood boil
I saw shadows fuse

Every move you make
Breaks me, breaks me
Every smile you fake
Breaks me, breaks me
Owah

Lets build ourselves an island
I want it now
If they build a prison
I'll Knock it down

Oh my naivety
Oh my fickled views
I feel my blood boil
I saw shadows fuse

Every move you make
Breaks me, breaks me, now
Every smile you fake
Breaks me, breaks me

I saw our shadows dance before the dawn
I saw our shadows dance before the dawn
I saw our shadows dance before the dawn
I saw our shadows dance
I saw our shadows dance

Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey

Every move you make
Breaks me, breaks me, now
Every smile you fake
Breaks me, breaks me
Owah, Owah, Owah, Owah
