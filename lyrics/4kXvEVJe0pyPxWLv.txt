It could be worse, I could be alone
I could be locked in here on my own
Like a stone that suddenly drops
It never stops, no
I could be lost, or I could be saved

Calling out from beneath the waves
Beaten down by this ocean rain
Never again
Never again
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh

Ooh, oh, oh
Screaming out from the crests of waves
It could be worse, bitter or sweet

You could be snapped from the jaws of defeat

Or like a light lit upon a beach
Wear your heart on your sleeve, oh
You want to stop before you begin
You want to sink when you know you could swim
You want to stop just before you begin
Never give in

Never give in
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Screaming out from the crests of waves

Nothing matters
Except life & the love you make
Nothing matters

Except life & the love you make

Nothing matters
Except life & the love you make
Except life & the love you make
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Screaming out from the crests of waves
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Screaming out from the crests of waves
Where you're longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves
Where you're longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves
