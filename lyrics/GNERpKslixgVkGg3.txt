Try to make my mind go numb but it won't
Waiting for the words to come but they don't
Pray to God, write it on the walls so they know
Staring at the ceiling now I'm alone

Didn't have the words, didn't have the courage
But I had to let it out
Like a sink that's overflowing to the brink
I was water on the ground
Can you feel it seeping underneath your skin
Yeah drowning all around you
I did my best to put it gently on your chest
And then I let you down

Hands shaped like I'm face to face with a ghost
But your face is a place I rarely go anymore
My eyes try to hide what you already know
This break is the hardest part, letting go

Didn't have the words, didn't have the courage
But I had to let it out
Like a sink that's overflowing to the brink
I was water on the ground
Can you feel it seeping underneath your skin
Yeah drowning all around you
I did my best to put it gently on your chest
And then I let you down
Can you feel it seeping underneath your skin
Yeah drowning all around you
I did my best to put it gently on your chest
And then I let you down
