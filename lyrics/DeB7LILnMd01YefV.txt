In every dream home a heartache
And every step I take
Takes me further from heaven

Is there a heaven?
I'd like to think so

Standards of living
They are rising daily
But home oh sweet home
It only a saying

From bell push to faucet
In smart town apartment
The cottage is pretty
The main house a palace

Penthouse perfection
But what goes on
What to do there
Better pray there

Open plan living
Bungalow ranch style
All of it's comforts
Seem so essential

I bought you mail order
My plain wrapper baby
Your skin is like vinyl
The perfect companion
You float in my new pool
Deluxe and delightful
Inflatable doll
My role is to serve you

Disposable darling
Can't throw you away now
Immortal and life size
My breath is inside you
I'll dress you up daily
And keep you till death sighs

Inflatable doll
Lover ungrateful
I blew up your body...
But you blew my mind

Oh Those Heartaches
Dreamhome Heartaches

Oh Those Heartaches
Dreamhome Heartaches

Oh Those Heartaches
Dreamhome Heartaches

Oh Those Heartaches
{Fades out then back again}
