I had a dream, a dream I said
A bloody dream in which I said:
"I'm not dead, oh dead"
I lie awake until I sleep, I see the sky tear, and then it weeps.
I was scared.
So scared.

The dream, it seems, is peeking, into real life.
The sun can't burn, the dream, from my eyes.
The dream, seeking, peeking, real life.
