You're gonna tell me why
You've got to tell me why
Can you tell me why?
Why don't you wanna tell me why?

Looking at me like this
Following me in the dark
Just arrived in this town
And I'm alone--
Except for the shadows on the wall
They look like no others
Feel my??? when I'm???

You're gonna tell me why
You've got to tell me why
Can you tell me why?
Why don't you wanna tell me why?

Just came back from Morgoth
I've developed a chemical imbalance there
The stress rises on my depression
And I need a fix-
I run away from everybody
I'm an experimental schizo
For (the spiders?)

You're gonna tell me why
You've got to tell me why
Can you tell me why?
Why don't you wanna tell me why?

Don't know their language
But I understand what they say!
Sure, I know their intentions
Kill me and leave me to rot!

They've taken part of it
I'm living in an endless nightmare
See what people couldn't see

Living in my own world
I (can?) get into others
It couldn't be worse

The world knows the truth
Except for those who are chasing me
The terror (here will?) never stop
Never stop!

I've had enough of this
(Violence here without morals?)
I ran away yesterday
My brain??? don't feel so sure
Paranoid, sceptic
Cannot live with this malfunction
Was????
Where was I born? I wanna go back???
(When you see I'm me, people die?)
When you have to run for your life
Maybe you're gonna change your track
When you are like me, three bullets in your back
But you have to keep the same way
'Cause they know all the tricks, and that's the game they play

That's the game they play!
That's the game they play!
Tha-Tha--game they play...
Tha... they play...
