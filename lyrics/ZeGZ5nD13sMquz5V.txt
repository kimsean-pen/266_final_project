I was given wine
We're feeling okay
And quite all right
You wash my tears away
And make me wanna stay
And bonfires lit up the shores

Walk far far away
To go beside you
Is where I want to be
Walk far far away
To laugh, to love

Days of roses and wine
Drifting astray
With your hand in mine
You stroke my fears away
And make me wanna stay
And bonfires lit up the shores

Walk far far away
To go beside you
Is where I want to be
Walk far far away
To laugh, to love

Walk far far away
Where to go and hide?
We're going to the sea
Walk far far away
To laugh, to love

And this is how it went;
I am here to stay
Roaring with the wind
There's life within'

This is what I give
A circle is complete
Another circle spins
There's life within'
Within'
