Learn to fly,
Learn to fly,
Show the world
How you try

But don't let go
Until you know,
Until you know
Me

'Cause I can see,
I can see
All the things
Arresting me
But I control,
I control

When I get home,
When I get home,
I want to feel less alone
I couldn't feel,
I couldn't feel
Anybody

This isn't home,
This isn't home,
I couldn't feel more alone.
I need to feel,
I need to feel
Somebody

'Cause I see the world
In different colors
To someone like you

This day, we'll all pull you in
Romantic and drenched in sin.
But you only have an amount of time
Until this place
Will swallow you whole

And everything I cannot imagine
This dim-lit room has seen much before me
And I don't want
To ever know,
To know

The city will pull you in
Romantic and drenched in sin
But you only have an amount of time
Until this place
Will swallow you whole
