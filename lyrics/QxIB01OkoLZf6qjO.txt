Weekend records take the streets
We're the bandit in their eye
But in our bedroom we're bloodshot and beat
And never so alive

But I know what's on your mind
God knows I put it there
But if I took it back
We'd be nowhere
You'd be nowhere again

I look at you all torn up
I left you waiting to bleed
I guess the truth works two ways
Maybe the truth's not what we need

And I know what's on your mind
God knows I put it there
But if I took it back
We'd be nowhere
You'd be nowhere again

But in my cold arms, you don't sleep
In my cold arms, you feel beat
In my cold arms
You stay
