I feel nothing
Longing for something
(Relax a minute, take your clothes off
Show me what you're made of)
Just to soothe me

(All alone)
Leave me here I'm dying
(All alone)
Just kicked me in my face
(All alone)
All alone and crying
(All alone)
I suffocate

I'm not gifted
Slightly twisted
(Try hard, try hard to see if I can push you any further)
Just to soothe me

(All alone)
Leave me here I'm dying
(All alone)
Just kicked me in my face
(All alone)
All alone and crying
(All alone)
I'll suffocate

Please believe
You'll save me, rearrange me
I can feel
Your feelings running through me
Take away
My sorrow, my tomorrow
Cradle me

(All alone)
Leave me here I'm dying
(All alone)
Just kick me in my face
(All alone)
All alone and crying
(All alone)
I'll suffocate

I'm suffocating

Suffocate
(I'm suffocating)
Suffocate
(I'm suffocating)
Suffocate
(I'm suffocating)
Suffocate
(I'm suffocating)
Suffocate
(I'm suffocating)
