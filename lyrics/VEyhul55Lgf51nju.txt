I woke up from a bad dream
The sun is peeking through the tall palm trees
I still ain't got no money
But the opportunity is all around me
Give a little and get a lot
Now go build the life you truly want

Go chase your paradise
Into the waves
This tide will carry you
Don't run away
Light a fire
That burns through the whole night
You will shine
Brighter than the sunrise

You woke up from a day dream
Faking a smile just to show your teeth
While stars are fading fast and crack beneath your feet
Close your eyes and use your head
I'm not wasting my time wondering

Go chase your paradise
Into the waves
This tide will carry you
Don't run away
Light a fire
That burns through the whole night
You will shine
Brighter than the sunrise
Dive right in
Stop coasting through your own life
Learn to value your time

I'm narrowing the gap between me and my fears
They're growing near
Like tattered sails on my horizon
I've used my voice to make a better life
I found the strength inside
Cause life is what happens when you're
Too afraid to climb

Go chase your paradise
Into the waves
This tide will carry you
Don't run away
Light a fire
That burns through the whole night
You will shine
Brighter than the sunrise
Dive right in
Stop coasting through your own life
Learn to value your time
