Get lost in all that picture and sound
I've been losing my mind
But now I'm no longer falling for ya
Girl I've been standing on a fault line

All at once
You act like you don't need me
And girl I'm holding on
I don't know what to believe in lately
You've been leading me on
(I'm on a fault line)

Standing on a fault line
Waiting for you all night
Thinking it's the right time to let you go
I've been hearing voices
Going back and forth not knowing
If I'm lost or on the own the way home

You keep me down
Don't pick me up

Fire breathing
Higher dreaming
You got me so tired of feeling
Like all the love I've given you
Ain't got any meaning
I can't believe it
Gimme a reason
Tell me it's not true or I'm leaving you

And I don't wanna know
You're just a saturnight spell
But if it's all a show
Then baby why can't I tell
And girl I've been told
We've been involved for too long
I've been loving too strong
Why has it taken me so long to see
You don't belong to me
Not like you used to
We're not like we used to be

Standing on a fault line
Waiting for you all night
Thinking it's the right time to let you go
I've been hearing voices
Going back and forth not knowing
If I'm lost or on the own the way home

You keep me down
Don't pick me up

Fire breathing
Higher dreaming
You got me so tired of feeling
Like all the love I've given you
Ain't got any meaning
I can't believe it
Gimme a reason
Tell me it's not true or I'm leaving you
