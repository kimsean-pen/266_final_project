You said you want me
That was just a lie (just a lie)
Just a lie (just a lie)
You said you love me
That was just a lie, just a lie
All I needed was someone
Who could keep me warm at night
You tried it baby, it didn't work
And now I know that this is
Gonna be the end

Ooh how could you lie
Ooh how could you lie
Ooh how could you lie
Could you lie
Could you lie

You said you need me that was just a lie
(just a lie) just a lie
You said the truth once
That was just a lie (just a lie) just a lie
All I needed was someone
Who could keep me warm at night
You tried it baby, it didn't work
And now I know that this is
Gonna be the end

Ooh how could you lie
Ooh how could you lie
Ooh how could you lie
Could you lie
Could you lie
Could you lie

Ooh how could you lie
Ooh how could you lie
Ooh how could you lie
Could you lie
Could you lie

All I needed was someone
Who could keep me warm at night
You tried it baby, it didn't work
And now I know that this is
Gonna be the end

Ooh how could you lie
Ooh how could you lie
Ooh how could you lie
Could you lie,
Could you lie
Could you lie
Ooh how could you lie
Ooh how could you lie
Ooh how could you lie
Could you lie,
Could you lie
Could you lie

Ooh how could you lie
Ooh how could you lie
Ooh how could you lie
Could you lie,
Could you lie
