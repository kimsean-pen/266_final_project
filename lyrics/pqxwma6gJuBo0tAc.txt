When you wake up, call the cab
We ain't telling anybody about us yet
and you want, all of it
but you ain't even got the guts to tell your friends

I want your lips, in public
But we both know the world ain't ready for that yet
So take my hand, in secret
Take my heart and put it in your pocket

I want the limelight with you
Want the world to see it but
We shine like diamonds with you
Take the world out for a ride

I want the limelight with you
We shine like diamonds with you
I want the limelight with you
We make love, in darkness
Not even willing to show what we won't confess
