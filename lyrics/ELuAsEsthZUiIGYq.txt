Injured plea crushed destiny
Deep down trauma hounds run to corrode integrity
Whatever matters and it would they fail to see
They make believe reality
Helpless deaths ignored to be judged as juvenile
Head caves in growing pains no time remains for fantasy
Tyranny exists we shrink beneath the ingrown thorns
Forced to accept pledge allegiance to a flag
Tested to forget you must resist they want you dead

Feels emptyness eternity keeps swallowing
Digested benefactors whose silence deafens anything
All of whom decease and miss to pierce a point
Objects and lessons to realize it's not the way
What's the point of giving up leaving won't change anything
Political resentment to push away all growth within
Puzzles me offers soul to nothing the message screams it's purity
That those with no rights display the right to have no life
To have respect they must accept a world commiting suicide
