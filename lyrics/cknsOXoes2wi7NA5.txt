What? You say you're through with me? I'm not through with you
We've had what others might call love
You say it's over now, what's done, what's through?
You can't stay away, you need me, oh, I need you

When the fire starts the pain's too much for your mind
You need attention, what's good is only mine
I can cure the hunger that burns in your heart
So just come to me, I'll take you home

We'll walk in the shadows
By day we'll live in a dream
(Walk with me)
We'll walk in the shadows

You say you don't feel safe alone tonight
'Cause you feel the pressure building in your head
Our secret's safe for one more night
But when the morning comes, remember I'll be with you

We'll walk in the shadows
By day we'll live in a dream
(Walk with me)
We'll walk in the shadows

One day you'll be home with me
If only you believe

We'll walk in the shadows
By day we'll live in a dream
(Walk with me)
We'll walk in the shadows
You'll get to stay with me

Walk in the shadows
(Walk with me)
Walk in the shadows
(Walk with me)
Walk in the shadows
(Walk with me)

Walk in the shadows
(Walk with me)
Walk in the shadows
(Walk with me)
Walk in the shadows
(Walk with me)

Walk with me
