A long time ago I went to the shore
I whispered my wish to a breeze from the North
The wind took the wish high to the stars
Told them what I've missed with all my heart

I was mesmerized by the rolling tide
I lay on that shore and gazed into the skies
Like a shooting star, my dream was gone
I made up my mind
I don't want to wake up

When will time heal and fulfill the dream of my heart?
When will we unite as one and light our own star?

All these memories I will treasure in my heart
Words are so vain
A bond beyond quintessence

For a thousand lifetimes
I will wait to feel
A passing moment of bliss
To be embraced by silence
When will time heal and fulfill the dream of my heart?
When will we unite as one and light our own star?
When will time heal and fulfill the dream of my heart?
When will we unite as one and light our own star?
When will time heal and fulfill the dream of my heart?
When will we unite as one and light our own star?
