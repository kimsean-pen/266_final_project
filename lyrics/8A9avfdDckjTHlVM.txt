In parting ways and parting hearts
A dress of leaves blows to the winds
Take these sacrificial remnants untended
Bashed to dust and trust distressed
Red cheeks caved in

I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
'Cause all we know is gone and cold
I don't believe anymore
Don't grieve anymore
'Cause all I hold is all I own

Is this a desperate wish for dying?
Or a wish that dying cease?
The fear that keeps me going and going and going
Is the same fear that brings me to my knees

I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
'Cause what was gold is gone and cold
I don't believe anymore
I won't grieve anymore
'Cause all we are is bled and gone

I am the air, the after
Always in the clouds, searching for some answer
Parted now, I am the shore repeated
Becoming air, I'm finally free

I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
What I can't see, can't hold to me
I don't believe anymore
I won't grieve anymore
'Cause what was gold is gone and cold

I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
'Cause what was gold is gone and cold
I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
I won't grieve anymore
Won't grieve anymore
For you
