I think I'm living in the same place
As we were when this begun
I think I'm staring at the same place
That was here since we were born

I think I'm having all the same dreams
About the desert and the rain
I think I'm gonna have to tell you
That I wanna start again

Who blocked the sun?
Who let it down?
I need an angel
Don't fail me now

Who blocked the sun?
Who let it down?
I need an angel
Don't fail me now

I need you to let me down
I'm making my way back to you
I need you to set me down
Before I'm broken in two

I've been hoping for the future
But the future never comes
I've been searching for an answer
Tell me now, what have I done?

Who blocked the sun?
Who let it down?
I need an angel
Don't fail me now

Who blocked the sun?
Who let it down?
I need an angel
Don't fail me now

I need you to let me down
I'm making my way back to you
I need you to set me down
Before I'm broken in two

I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you

I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
