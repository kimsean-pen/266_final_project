Say rubber
Rubber lover

Don't go to bed mad at your lover
You'll wind up pulling the covers from each other
Don't make love without wearing a rubber
They might have slept with another

Rubber lover

Just have a good time
Just have a good time

Don't be rushin' when you're pushin' for your lovin'
Take your time when you do the natural thing
So divine to feel the passion in this fashion
Put your brain before your ding-a-ling

Just have a good time
Just have a good time
