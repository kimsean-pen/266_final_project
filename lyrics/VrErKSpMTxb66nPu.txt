Tipper what's that sticker
sticking on my CD
Is that some kind of warning
to protect me.
Freedom of choice

needs a stronger stronger voice
You can stamp out the source
but you can't stop creative thought.

Ah Tipper come on
ain't you been getting it on
ask Ozzy Zappa or me

we'll show you
what it's like to be free.
Ah Tipper come on
it's just a smokescreen

for the real problems
S&L deficit the homeless the enviornment.
Hey hey all you all you

senator's wives
better take a good look
at your own lives

before you go preach to me
your definition of obsenity.
Ah Tipper come on

ain't you been getting it on
ask Ozzy Zappa or me
we'll show you

what it's like to be free.
Ah Tipper come on
it's just a smokescreen
for the real problems
S&L deficit the homeless the enviornment.
The irony it seems it seems to me
it's unamerican policy yeah
we come so far
but still only to find
people like you
with ignorant minds.
Ah Tipper come on
ain't you been getting it on
ask Ozzy Zappa or me
we'll show you
what it's like to be free.
Ah Tipper come on
it's just a smokescreen
for the real problems
S&L deficit the homeless the enviornment.
