She was running around and she said

I was teenage girl
She was running around and she said
Everything is everything is gone

I was teenage girl
And she was running around and she said
Everything is everything is gone

I was teenage girl
And she was running around and she said
Everything is everything is gone

Are we throwing it? Throwing it away tonight?
Are we throwing it? Throwing it all?

I was teenage girl
She was running around and she said
Everything is everything is gone
