I look at you and see
My life that might have been
Your face just ghostly in the smoke.
They're setting fire to the cornfields
As you're taking me home.
The smell of burning fields
Will now mean you and here.
This is where i want to be
This is what i need
This is where i want to be
This is what i need
This is where i want to be
But i know that this will never be mine.
Ooh, the thrill and the hurting
The thrill and the hurting
I know that this will never be mine.
I want you as the dream
Not the reality
That clumsy goodbye kiss could fool me
But i'm looking back over my shoulder
At you, happy without me.
This is where i want to be
This is what i need
This is where i want to be
This is what i need
This is where i want to be
But i know that this will never be mine.
Ooh, the thrill and the hurting
Will never be mine.
The thrill and the hurting
It will never be mine.
It can never be
The thrill and the hurting
Will never be mine.
