I feel your heart, it beats against
The side of my face
I'm holding on the memory
Of our embrace

I see your smile and I'll never want it to fade again
(Again, again)
(Again and again)

You find your way trough hideaways
In the back of your mind
Let's hope I find the energy
I'll never deny (again)

I feel alive, you saved my heart
I lost control (control)
I feel alive, you saved my mind
I wanted you to know

I'm holding on the fairytale
Of our embrace (again)

I feel alive, you saved my heart
I lost control
I feel alive, you saved my mind
I wanted you to know

I feel alive, you saved my heart
I wanted you... to know
