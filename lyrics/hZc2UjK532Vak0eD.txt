Well, she's not bleeding on the ballroom floor
Just for the attention
'Cause that's just ridiculously odd

Well, she sure is going to get it
Here's the setting
Fashion magazines line the walls now
The walls line the bullet holes...

You sure, You're sure...
Have some composure
Where is your posture?
Oh, no, no
You're pulling the trigger
Pulling the trigger

All wrong
Have some composure
Where is your posture?
Oh, no, no
You're pulling the trigger
Pulling the trigger

All wrong
Give me envy, give me malice, give me all your attention
When I say "Shotgun", you say "Wedding"
"Shotgun", "Wedding"(Fans), "Shotgun", "Wedding"(fans)

But they believe it from the tears
And the teeth right down to the blood
At her feet
Boys will be boys
Hiding in estrogen and wearing Aubergine dreams
You're sure, You're sure...
Have some composure
Where is your posture?
Oh, no, no(fans)

You're pulling the trigger
Pulling the trigger
All wrong
Have some composure
Where is your posture?
Oh, no, no
You're pulling the trigger
Pulling the trigger
All wrong
