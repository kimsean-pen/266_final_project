I kissed you goodbye at the airport
Held you so close to me, I said
"So here we are now and I can't stop from crying Lilly"
And you said "Hey hey ho, you know this is the way to go
You will forget about me when I'm on that plane
Forget about me when I'm on that plane"

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight

The plane took off and my love went with it
The chilly wind whipped my both cheeks hard
And the man that stood there next to me said "Everything is gonna be alright"
I said "Nothing is gonna be alright, but thank you anyway"
And then I saw your face in the airplane window
I waved my hands and I shouted to you

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight

I wore a T-shirt and my worn out hat
Abandoned as a summer cat
And as I stood there as a broken hearted
I realized you got the car keys still
So I broke into my own old car
I fell asleep on the passenger seat
I dreamed of summer sex with you
And you whispered in my ear

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight

Why can't you leave me tomorrow instead?
Why can't you leave me tomorrow instead?

And above the clouds she said to herself
"I can't believe how naive a man can be
That's why I love you so
And that's why I can't be with you"

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight
