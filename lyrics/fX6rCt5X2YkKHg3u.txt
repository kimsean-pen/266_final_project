This is a warning shot
Your final call
An empty morgue
With gurning hearts

Hollowed crowns
And all I see
Is marching bands
Is marching bands

Marching bands
Which never rest
In broken stands

Butcher birds
With useless throats
With useless throats

We're not safe
Of dying kings
With plastic knives

It's just another hospital
It's just another, it's just another
It's just another hospital
It's just another, it's just another

It's just another hospital
It's just another hospital
It's just another hospital
It's just another, it's just another

Captains made
With metal tags
Flags brought down
Of hollowed crowns

It's everything
Without a time
It's just a
It's just a

It's just another hospital
It's just another, it's just another
It's just another hospital
It's just another, it's just another

Goodbye all
Your marching bands
Laid to rest
In broken stands

Butcher birds
Will fly away
Will fly away
Will fly away

This is not
A warning call
Your final shot

All I see
Is butcher birds
Will fly away
Electric bloom

It's just another hospital
It's just another, it's just another
It's just another hospital
It's just another, it's just another
