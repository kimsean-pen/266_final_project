I opened my eyes
and watched the sunshine
it had been out all night
to relax and unwind

there will come a time gigantic
waves will crush the junk that I have saved
when the moon explodes or floats away
I'll lose the souvenirs I made
la la la

I lay down on the grass
and let the insects do their thing
she covered me with wings and
held my head and said 'poor thing'

there will come a time gigantic
waves will crush the junk that I have saved
when the moon explodes or floats away
I'll lose the souvenirs I saved
la la la
