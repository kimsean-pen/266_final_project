So solitary
You have been
Your time starts to fade
Distorted sky
And you find me
Revolve inside
My blood is yours too
That's what you say
It couldn't be further from the truth

I find
The soul in medication
All my loving has turned and washed away

You took my mind's eye
You bring it wherever you go
How could you take away
The burning I had
My rage
Static
The closing line
Whatever you say
It's my heart you leech
You crushed the edge of symmetry

Insignificant
You are still
But my words in your mouth
Lingering
Spilling over

I see
You don't want liberation
You keep belonging to what's not even here
