Been hearing about you, all about your disapproval
Still I remember the way I used to move you
I wrote you a letter, I heard it just upset you
Why don't you tell me, how can I do this better?

Are you out there, do you hear me?
Can I call you, do you still hate me?
Are we talking, are we fighting?
Is it over, are we writing?

We're getting older, but we're acting younger
We should be smarter, it seems we're getting dumber
I have a picture of you and me in Brooklyn
On a porch, it was raining, hey, I remember that day

Are you out there, do you hear me?
Can I call you, do you still hate me?
Are we talking, are we fighting?
Is it over, are we writing?

Hey I miss you

Are you out there, do you hear me?
Can I call you, do you still hate me?
Are we talking, are we fighting?
Is it over, are we writing?

Hey I miss you
