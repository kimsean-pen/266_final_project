Got my eye on you
God I need you in my life
Don't know what to do
Gotta make you all mine

There's no explanation
For my adoration
It's just pure sensation
My infatuation

I want you
I need you
I want you
I need you

You drive me crazy
Think I'm going insane
You were made for me
You're always in my brain

There's no explanation
For my adoration
It's just pure sensation
My infatuation

I want you
I need you
I want you
I need you

I want you
I need you
I want you
I need you
