So I dance through the night
Out of breath
In a crowd very grey and faceless youth
I am somebody, somewhere...
Not belonging, not belonging

So I try to escape
But your heart is beating in my chest
Through the haze of dead neon city dreams
You are everyone, you are everywhere

Watching apartments floating by
Through cigarette smoke
Red lips smiling, darkened glasses
Staring and seductive movements

I am no one, I am nowhere
I am no one, I am nowhere

You are everyone, you are everywhere
You are everyone, you are everywhere
You are everyone, you are everywhere
You are everyone, you are everywhere
