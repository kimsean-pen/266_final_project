You know it only breaks my heart
To see you standin' in the dark
Alone waitin' there for me to come back
I'm too afraid to show

If it's comin' over you
Like it's comin' over me
I'm crashin' like a tidal wave
That drags me out to sea
I wanna be with you
If you wanna be with me
Crashin' like a tidal wave
I don't wanna be

Stranded
Stranded
Stranded
(So baby come back to me)
Stranded
(So baby come back to me)

I can only take so much
These tears are turnin' me to rust
I know, you're waitin' there for me to come back
I'm too afraid to show

If it's comin' over you
Like it's comin' over me
I'm crashin' like a tidal wave
That drags me out to sea
I wanna be with you
If you wanna be with me
Crashin' like a tidal wave
I don't wanna be

Stranded
(It's coming over you)
Stranded
(It's comin' over me)
Stranded
(It's comin' over you)
Stranded
(Yeah yeah yeah)

I miss you
I need you
Without you
I'm stranded
I love you
So come back
I'm not afraid to show

Crashin' like a tidal wave
Drags me out to sea
I wanna be with you
You wanna be with me
Crashin' like a tidal wave
I don't wanna be

Stranded
(It's comin' over you)
Stranded
(It's comin' over me)
Stranded
(It's comin' over you)
Stranded
Stranded
(So baby come back to me)
Stranded
(So baby come back to me)
Stranded

Stranded
(It's comin' over you)
Stranded
Stranded
Stranded
(It's comin' over you)
Stranded
(It's comin' over me)
Stranded
(It's comin' over you)
Stranded
(So baby come back to me)

Stranded
Stranded
(Oh yeah)
Stranded
(So baby come back to me)
Stranded
(So baby come back to me)
Stranded
Stranded
Stranded
Stranded
