Slow, so slow you can't see me
I'm sneaking through your house, get low
Invisibility cloak getting under your skin, it's showtime
And I know it's a crime, it's a wonderful crime but it's mine
And I'm gonna take it back, gonna take it back
Loving you, it's my alibi
Fooling you, it's that trick of mine
And I know it's a crime, crime, crime
Loving you, it's my alibi
Slow, so slow you can't see me
I'm sneaking through your house, get low
Invisibility cloak getting under your skin, it's showtime
And I know it's a crime, it's a wonderful crime but it's mine
And I'm gonna take it back, gonna take it back
And I'm gonna take it back, gonna take it back
And I'm gonna take it back, gonna take it back

Loving you, it's my alibi
Fooling you, it's that trick of mine
And I know it's a crime, crime, crime
Loving you, it's my alibi

Oh you want my love, want my love, want my love so bad
Yes, it's true, it's just a trap, just a trap, just a trap
And I'm gonna take it back, gonna take it back

Loving you, it's my alibi
Fooling you, it's that trick of mine
And I know it's a crime, crime, crime
Loving you, it's my alibi
Loving you, it's my alibi
Fooling you, it's that trick of mine
And I know it's a crime, crime, crime
Loving you, it's my alibi

And I'm gonna take it back, gonna take it back
And I'm gonna take it back, gonna take it back
