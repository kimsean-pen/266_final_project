Never thought that at a moment like this
All I wanted to feel was your kiss
So many words on the tip of my tongue
So many things that you should have done

And now it hurts that I want you to stay
Nobody asked me if I was okay
In 6 seconds I count 10 reasons to go
Every day people tell me something else I know

Yet, nobody asked me what I wanted
Nobody asked me

I tried to ask you
But nobody asked me
I tried to ask you
But nobody asked me

If I was okay
Nobody asked me, nobody asked me
If I was okay
Nobody asked me

Nobody asked me if I was okay!
No no no no no no
Nobody asked if I was okay

Shaking your head while I try to explain
You say you don't wanna hear me complain
Just tryin' to get my point across
You don't seem to care if I'm feeling lost

And now it hurts that I want you to stay
I can't understand why I feel this way
All the friends I've ever had tell me go
Every day I hear them saying something else I know

Yet, nobody asked me what I wanted
Nobody asked me

I tried to ask you
But nobody asked me
I tried to ask you
But nobody asked me

If I was okay
Nobody asked me, nobody asked me
If I was okay
Nobody asked me

Nobody asked me if I was okay!
No no no no no no
Nobody asked if I was okay

I hear a siren
Guiding me closer
I hear its echo
Over and over

I tried to ask you
I tried to ask you
I tried to ask when
Nobody asked
I tried to ask you
But nobody asked me
I tried to ask you
But nobody asked me
If I was okay
Nobody asked me, nobody asked me
If I was okay
Nobody asked me
Nobody asked me if I was okay!
No no no no no no
Nobody asked if I was okay
