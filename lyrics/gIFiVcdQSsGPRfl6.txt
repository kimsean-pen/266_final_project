We are better off as long as we are cheaters
Cheaters
Out of seeing your bad behavior falling deeper
Deeper

I lack in trust of emotions order
Oh you are get decide to put the glass
My sense of devotion order
Cause you're not what I need
And you feed all the lies in my head
Still you never get me nowhere
Lack of emotions

Once I thought that you and I might have a chance
Chance
Heart beats promises of honesty won't last
Never last

I lack in trust of emotions order
Oh you are get decide to put the glass
My sense of devotion order
Cause you're not what I need
And you feed all the lies in my head
Still you never get me nowhere
Lack of emotions

Why do you fly and go this way?
I never asked of you to come and save me
Maybe I will die alone
But I won't have to bother once I'm gone

I lack in trust of emotions order
Oh you are get decide to put the glass
My sense of devotion order
Cause you're not what I need
And you feed all the lies in my head
Still you never get me nowhere
Lack of emotions
