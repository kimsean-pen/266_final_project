I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture

Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic Royalty

Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld

So I can sigh eternally
I'm so tired I can't sleep
I'm a liar and thief
sit and drink pennyroyal tea
I'm anemic Royalty

I'm on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry- Flavored antacids
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink pennyroyal tea
I'm anemic royalty.
