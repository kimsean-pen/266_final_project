You destroy me from the inside out
But it only makes me love you more
I guess there's nothing left to talk about
and I...
How many times have I had it and lost it?
They bring up the past
I'm changing the topic
And everybody's telling me to give up and drop it
Echoing constant
But failure's not an option
Don't be obnoxious
I'm losing my conscious
I'd rather be the nail than the one in the coffin
The one you've forgotten has got nothing else left to hide
'Cause I never told the truth
But now it's coming to life
It's like

You destroy me from the inside out
But it only makes me love you more

I guess there's nothing left to talk about

And I just don't care anymore

If that's the way it has to be

Then break your teeth when you take a bite of me

Can we get back to the basics?
The days all seem so faded
Smile on my face, everyday
Because I faked it
And I can't take the face in the mirror
So let's face it
Worst sleep in years
'Cause fear makes you complacent

So I just pile it out,
Everything I'm about

So busy walking on your tight rope
I figured it out

So here we go, here I am
It's not for me or for them

'Cause we forgive and forget
And then we do it again (No!)

You destroy me from the inside out
But it only makes me love you more

I guess there's nothing left to talk about
And I just don't care anymore
So find another way to break me down

And make it hurt like it did before
If that's the way it has to be
Then break your teeth when you take a bite of me

(Fuck it!)
You destroy me from the inside out
But it only makes me love you more (We're headed for the ground!)

You destroy me from the inside out
But it only makes me love you more
I guess there's nothing left to talk about
And I just don't care anymore
So find another way to break me down
And make it hurt like it did before
If that's the way it has to be
Then break your teeth when you take a bite of me
