I'd heard of you
From a voice at the door
I'd heard of you
And the ghost that you were

A trace of you
Just a flash
A fingerprint
On the glass

A trace of you
In the room
Just what was it
That you knew

She's only a shadow
She's only a shadow

I looked for you
In the gaps
Of the walls
I looked for you
At some funeral

A trace of you
Had me stuck
A photograph
I didn't trust

A trace of you
Barely used
On the trail
But out of view

She's only a shadow
She's only a shadow
She's only a shadow

She's only a shadow
She's only a shadow
