They slit our throats
Like we were flowers
And our milk has been
Devoured
When you want it
Goes away too fast
Times you hate it
Always seems to last
Just remember
When you think you're free
The crack inside your fuckin' heart is me
I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day
I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day
I wish I could sleep
But I can't lay on my back
Because there's a knife
For everyday that I've known you
When you want it
Goes away too fast
Times you hate it
Always seems to last
Just remember
When you think you're free
The crack inside your fuckin' heart is me
I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day
I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day
Lie to me, cry to me, give to me, I would
Lie with me, die with me, give to me, I would
Keep all your secrets wrapped in dead hair
I wish, keep all your secrets wrapped in dead hair
I wish
Lie to me, cry to me, give to me, I would
Lie with me, die with me, give to me, I would
Hope that we die holding hands
for always
Hope that we die holding hands
For always
Hope that we die holding hands
