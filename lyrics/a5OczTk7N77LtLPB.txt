That low down man of mine
Mistreats me all the time
He says he loves me only
then turns around and leaves me sad and lonely

If he could see through my eyes
and be the one who cries
he, he would see
he would never be
that low down man of mine

That low down man with his low down ways
I know he'll go someday
I'll wait till when the story's ending
It won't be long, but from now on

If he could see through my eyes
and be the one who cries
he, he would see
he would never be
that low down man of mine

If he could see through my eyes
and be the one who cries
he, he would see
he'd come back to me
that low down man
