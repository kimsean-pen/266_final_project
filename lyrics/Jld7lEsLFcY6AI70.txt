What's a boy to do
If I don't get the clue
That you're on your way out
Something strikes again
I don't get the hit
Then I get let down, let down

But someday
I'll feel loved
Someday
I'll feel loved
Someday

What do I gotta do
When all I want is you
You're just on your way out
If I keep giving in
And you stay on the fence
Will you ever come down, come down

But someday
I'll feel loved
Someday
I'll feel loved
Someday

Someday
You're loved someday

But someday
I'll feel loved
Someday
I'll feel loved
Someday
Someday
