You should be wilder
You're no fun at all
Yeah, thanks for the input
Thanks for the call

With dull knives and white hands
The blood of a stone
Cold to the touch, right
Right down the bone

But you give me the electric twist
And it kicks, and it kicks like a pony
And true, you might get away with it
It's a risk, it's a risk, yeah

Picked from a hot grove
Packaged for sale
It drips down the sleeve
Gets under your nails

A loss of the senses
A chip off a tooth
The smells of the city
They ride in your suit

He says don't think, don't talk
Don't think
Don't think, don't talk
Don't think
Don't think, don't talk
But I don't think I want to

'Cause you give me the electric twist
And it kicks, and it kicks like a pony
And true, you might run away with it
It's a risk, it's a risk, yeah

Because it kicks, yeah
It really kicks, yeah

And the touch of your lips
It's a shock, not a kiss
it's electric twist, it's electric twist

Yeah, the touch of your lips
It's a shock, not a kiss
It's electric twist, it's electric twist
It's electric twist, it's electric twist
It's electric twist, it's electric twist

He says don't think, don't talk
Don't think
Don't think, don't talk
Don't think
Don't think, don't talk
But I don't think I want to

'Cause you give me the electric twist
And it kicks, and it kicks like
And true, let 'ya get away with it
It's a risk, it's a risk, yeah

You might get away with it
It's a risk, yeah
But it kicks, yeah
It really kicks, yeah
