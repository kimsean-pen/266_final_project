I was born with my head around the wrong way
Both eyes always on what's behind me
I was born with my head around the wrong way
Both eyes always on what's behind, behind, behind

(Don't) take me off the wall, the wall
Take me off the wall, the wall

You're way out. I'm way in, in that's all we can be
You lose yourself in the place that surrounds me
I bear the marks, still bear them so
Smoother than the river stones
A familiar tune still fuels me
So, you can't hide me

(Don't) take me off the wall, the wall
Take me off the wall, the wall

Of what is said, of what I can be
I said so, a sum so powerful

I was born with my head around the wrong way
