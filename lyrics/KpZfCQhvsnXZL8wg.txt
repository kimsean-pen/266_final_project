Walkin' on the streets of DC
on the East Coast - where I live
you say "what's the problem?"
"what's with this angry kid?"
You dont like the way I walk
or the way I talk
or the way I swing my hands
you dont like the words I speak
or the thoughts I think
and I know you'll never understand.

You know
on the East Coast we ride until we die
you know
well there's a place inside my mind, yeah
a place you'll never find
there's a place inside my mind
walk this way
you know.

And wouldn't it be perfect
if I could sit with you?
and we would change a thing or two?
we'd change a thing or two?
we would change the way you think
we would change the way I think
we cant change the way they think
so we're not changin' anything
you know

on the East Coast we ride until we die
you know
well there's a place inside my mind, yeah
a place you'll never find
there's a place inside my mind
we leave today
you know

'cause on the east coast, we ride until the day we die

well there's a place inside my mind yeah
a place you'll never find
there's a place inside my mind
walk this way
there's a place inside my mind yeah
a place you'll never find
theres a place inside my mind
we leave today
you know
