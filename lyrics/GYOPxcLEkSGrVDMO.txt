Now the night train is waitin'
To take me away
And I'm still feelin' guilty cause you're wantin' me to stay
Well I know, how I know
It's harder on you
But then you said it yourself
There's nothing else we can do
When the wheels start turnin'
Takin' me through the night
Out there in the darkness, there's a star shinin' bright
And it makes me feel better
Just to see it up there
Hope you're thinkin' about it
Hope you know I still care
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home
Now I know you've been waitin'
But I'll be seein' you soon
Meanwhile I just stay here stare at the moon
And that light made of silver
Through my window it creeps
And the train keeps on rollin'
And it rocks me to sleep
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home

So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home
Now from city to city
It's four hundred miles
And I'm bound to wake up every once in a while
And it's then that I call out
To some higher power
And then I'll go back to sleep cause I'll be home in an hour
So goodnight (goodnight), yeah goodnight (goodnight)
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home (goodnight)
So goodnight (goodnight), yeah goodnight (goodnight)
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home (goodnight)
So goodnight (goodnight), yeah goodnight (goodnight)
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home (goodnight)
So goodnight (goodnight), yeah goodnight (goodnight)
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home (goodnight)
