Wouldn't wake up this morning
Believe me
This might be your only warning
And you'll see
Why the rules won't slide
For seeing something bright
But darker and darker they get
As my clothes don't sweat
And start to weep
As we sleep

And everything hits you in the end
And spoils your thought stream
My heart got a hold of my head
And ripped it to its seams
My confessions seem well bled
But resolutions are only dreams
And now I'm covered in blood on the bed
And it's a familiar scene
Cause I'm pretty sure my mind ran down this line again
Only last week
