Dyed in daybreak's light
Sound asleep, curled
Blue bird's first flight
Silent world

Burnished by Autumn
Trees hued in crimson
Yet the days darken
Now you've gone away

Waking from a dream
The sun floods her eyes
To unravel such a scene
Of scarlet splendour

Burnished by Autumn
Trees hued in crimson
Yet the days darken
Now you've gone away
