Stepping out of bounds, circling in rounds, dragging me along
Pushing me and pulling me, you're raging out and twisting me
Pathetic in your ways, are you still the same?
Your selfishness, a curse
You push it, fighting me, accusing me, you interfere, controlling me
Slowly, surely, you'll find out

Suddenly you slip away, lost, when the truth kicked in
Open your eyes, you're astray
You're alone and you got what you gave

Reality can hurt and so I can, I'll try
Pain should make it clear
You're scaring me and forcing me
I'm fearing you, stop breaking me
Paranoia lies
Is it hard to see
I'm sure it can be
But you have crossed the line
You did it, too often
Pushing me and pulling me
I'm bleeding here, you're killing me
Angry
Lonely
You'll find out

Suddenly you slipped away, lost, when the truth kicked in
Open your eyes, you're astray
You're alone and I'm not there to save you

Pushing me and pulling me, you're raging out and twisting me
Fighting me, accusing me, you interfere, controlling me
You're scaring me and forcing me
I'm fearing you, stop breaking me
Pushing me and pulling me
I'm bleeding here, you're killing me

Suddenly you slip away, lost, when the truth kicked in
Open your eyes, you're astray
You're alone and you got what you gave

Suddenly all slipped away and you lost control
Now you'll see, you're alone and you got what you gave in the end
