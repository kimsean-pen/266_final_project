For your love
For your love

When I think about those nights in Montreal
I get the sweetest thoughts of you and me
Memories of love above the city lights
Ooh... I've tried so hard to take it
But alone my heart won't make it

I just wanna stop
And tell you what I feel about you babe
I... just wanna stop
I never wanna live without you babe
I... just gotta stop
For your love...
Oh-oh-oh...

(for your love)
For your love
(for your l-o-v-e...)

When I think about the way the world must turn
(the world must turn)
I get the saddest thoughts for you and me (you and me)
Memories of life from times go on and on
Ooh... I try hard to forget it
But alone my mind won't let it
I just wanna stop

And tell you what I feel about you babe
I... just wanna stop
The world ain't right without you babe
I... just gotta stop
For your love...
Ooh... I try so hard to take it

But I know my heart won't make it
I... just wanna stop
And tell you what I feel about you babe
I... just wanna stop
The world ain't right without you babe
I... just wanna stop
For your love... (stop)
(hoo-hoo-hoo...)
I... just wanna stop
(hoo-hoo-hoo...)
I... just wanna stop
And tell you (hoo-hoo-hoo...) what I feel about you babe
I... just wanna stop
The world (hoo-hoo-hoo...) ain't right without you babe
I... just wanna stop
(hoo-hoo-hoo...)
I... just wanna stop
