I'm not the one who invented the sun
But I know who did
Check out the knife on the millionaire's wife
Getting all unhinged

Trying to decide who's good and who's just rich
Took all of his money and she burned it in a ditch

Look out below 'cause it's not the tempo
It's the truth in the song
Tried to give it back on a charity track
But they argued all night long

About who did deserve this dirty wealth
Baby when we die, yeah we're all gonna burn in hell

Dog at the door who's the king of hardcore 'cause he's always been
Booking the shows where they sell the most clothes 'cause they're so limited

Trying to decide who is good and who's just poor
Baby when we die, yeah, we're all gonna want some more
