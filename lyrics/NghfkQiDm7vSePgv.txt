Broken people get recycled
And I hope that I will
Sometimes we're thrown off our pathways
What I thought was my way home
Wasn't the place I know

no i'm not afraid of changing
I'm certain nothing's certain
What we own becomes our prison
My possessions will be gone

Back to where they came from
Blame, no one is to blame
As natural as the rain that falls

Here comes the flood again
See the rock that you hold onto
Is it gonna save you
When the earth begins to crumble?
Why do you feel you have to hold on?

Imagine if you let go
Blame, no one is to blame
As natural as the rain that falls

Here comes the flood again
Wash away the weight
That pulls you down
Ride the waves

That free you from the dusk?
Don't trust your mind
It's not always listening
Turn on the lights

And feel the ancient rhythm
Don't trust your eyes
Its easy to believe them
Know in your heart
That you can leave your prison
Blame, no one is to blame
As natural as the rain that falls
Here comes the flood again
