Rise up, take back control
Rise up, take back control
Rise up, take back control
Rise up, take back control

I find resolve in the darkest part of my mind
I can stand to be inside
I find the light to be a little much at times
But I will rise

I will rise up
With the weight of the world
I will rise up
From the darkness, purged

Rise up, take back control
Rise up, take back control
Rise up, take back control
Rise up, take back control

I face the truth with a bitterness that won't
Subside, and I face it alone
I'll be the pariah in your war against yourself
But I will rise

This is the product of hatred and anger
A life spent on the outside, but I will rise

I will rise up
With the weight of the world
I will rise up
From the darkness, purged

I will rise up
With the weight of the world
I will rise up
From the darkness, purged

I will rise up
With the weight of the world
I will rise up
From the darkness, purged

Rise up, rise up
Rise up, take back control
Rise up, take back control
Rise up, take back control
Rise up, take back control
