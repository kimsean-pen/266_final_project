Bored, stoned, sitting in your basement
All alone, cause your little conversations
got around, now look at what we all found out
(look at what we found, look here we all found out)

That you have got a set of loose lips, twisting stories
All because you're jealous
Now I know exactly what you're all about (what you're all about)
And this is what you're all about.

Girl, your such a backstabber
(stabber, you're such a backstabber)
Oh girl, you're such a shit talker
And everybody knows it (and everybody knows it)

Girl, your such a backstabber
(stabber, you're such a backstabber)
Run your mouth more than everyone I've ever known
And everybody knows it (and everybody knows it)

Back Back Backstabber
Talk Talk Talk

I'm sick and tired of hearing all about my life

from other bitches with all of your lies
wrapped up so tight, so maybe you should shut your mouth
(shut your mouth, shut your fucking mouth)
Honestly, I think its kinda funny that you waste

your breath talking about me
Got me feeling kinda special
Girl, your such a backstabber

(stabber, you're such a backstabber)
Oh girl, you're such a shit talker
And everybody knows it (and everybody knows it)
Girl, your such a backstabber

(stabber, you're such a backstabber)
Run your mouth more than everyone I've ever known
And everybody knows it (and everybody knows it)
Katie's to the left ripping my style (damn)

Damn, Jeanie why you gotta tell the secrets about my sex life?
All I ever did was drive your broke ass around
Pick you up, take you out
when your car broke down
