I been in a rut
Ducked off from the sun
Bit my gun
With my black gold gums
I'm no fun
I'm no fun
Blood run marathons
Down my chest (Down my chest)
I'm a mess
Ain't nobody gonna clean up
Bulletproof your limousine
I been in the
Market for a brand new soul
Daddy hit a brand new low
Better yet another agoraphobic episode
Here we go again here we go again here we go
Cut me up to little pieces like you're Ed Poe
Let me rest in pieces underneath the floorboards
Planet on fire no fucks given
I'mma let it all die let 'em all die
Really I

Haven't been good to myself
And you haven't been good to me
I haven't been good to myself
And lately, you haven't been good to me

Lately I decided I'mma stay alive
I just wanna live and see society die
Lookin' around and all I see is at the
End of the line I see a dystopia (Dystopia)
Evil all over and no one is safe
Nihilist I am the finest though I don't align with it
We're all to blame
Keep on denying it

You think that I need you
I'll show you I'm fine

You think that I need you
You think that I need you
You think that I need you
You think that I need you

You think that I need you (Need you)
I'll show you I'm fine (I'm fine)
