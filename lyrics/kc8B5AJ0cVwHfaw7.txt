Too many teardrops
for one heart to be cryin'.
Too many teardrops
for one heart to carry on.

You're way on top now
since you left me.
You're always laughin'
way down at me.

But watch out now,
I'm gonna get there.
We'll be together
for just a little while.
And then I'm gonna put you
way down here.

And you'll start cryin'
ninety-six tears.

Cry. Cry.

And when the sun comes up,
I'll be on top.
You be right down there,
lookin' up
And I might wave
come up here.
But I don't see you
wavin' now.
I'm way down here
wonderin' how,
I'm gonna get you,
but I know now,
I'll just cry,
cry, I'll just cry.

Too many teardrops
for one heart to be cryin'.
Too many teardrops
for one heart to carry on.

You're gonna cry ninety-six tears.
You're gonna cry ninety-six tears.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry, now.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry.

Ninety-six tears,
c'mon and lemme hear you cry, now.
Ninety-six tears, whoo!
I wanna hear you cry,
Night and day, yeah, all night long.
Uh, ninety-six tears cry, cry, cry.
C'mon baby, let me hear you cry now,
all night long.
Uh, ninety-six tears! Yeah! C'mon now.
Uh, ninety-six tears!...
