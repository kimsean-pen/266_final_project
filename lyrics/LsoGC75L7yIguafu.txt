Farewell we call to the earth and hall
Though wind may blow so fast rain may fall
We must away ere break of day
For over wood, tree and mountain tall.

With foes ahead, behind us dread
Beneath the sky's our bed
Until at last our toil be passed
Our journey's done with sped

Beneath the moon and under a tall star
I wandered so far from northern lands
Bewildered on enchanting charming ways
So far from the days of mortal lands

From gashing of the narrow ice so near
Where shadows lie frozen on the hills top
From neither heats and burning glowing waste
I'm turning in haste and fear
