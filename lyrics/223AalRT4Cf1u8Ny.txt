I was once asked how I'd like to be remembered
and I simply smiled and said "I'd rather
stay forever." It was possibly my loudest clich√©
but felt better than just walking away. I don't
know what my legacy will be. A song, some
words I wrote, or a kid I'll never see. All of
these things scare me half to death. I'll suffer
the day just hoping for the best. But that's not
to say I don't think that all of this can change.
But that's not to say I won't wake up some day
with a lion's pride that I'm going to be okay.
If again I'm asked how I'd like to be remembered,
next time I'll be better prepared for
the answer, but you'll never know much of
the truth, so I'll just exist. It's all I can do. So
much to consider and too much to grasp. To
swallow mortality is enough of a task and
leaving your mark is just too much to ask.
I'll just bow my head and leave out the back.
