Somebody call the heat
There's been a robery
You stole my soul, my fire
Took the best of me
Ring the alarm, somebody call secutiry
His tic toc, click clack
Is pointing at me
Tonight I saw the evil in your eyes
It's undeniable
You crossed the line
But I never believed you would open fire
Love assassin with the Smith and Weston
Click clack
Bang bang
You shot me to the ground
I took a bullet toi the heart
You kicked me down
Click clack
Bang bang
And now you're on the run
I never thought that love could kill me like a gun
Oooh, time is running out
Oooh, my heart is bleeding now
Click clack
Bang bang
Oh, you shoot me down
It's murder
It's murder
It's bloody murder
I'm going out my head thinking how could this be
Whatever happened, boy I gave you everything
You must have confused me with the enemy
But it's no friendly fire when
You go and murder me
Tonight
I saw something different in your eyes
It's undeniable
You crossed the line
But I never believed you opened the fire
Love assassin with the Smith and Weston
Click clack
Bang bang
You shot me to the ground
I took a bullet toi the heart
You kicked me down
Click clack
Bang bang
And now you're on the run
I never thought that love could kill me like a gun
Oooh, time is running out
Oooh, my heart is bleeding now
Click clack
Bang bang
Oh, you shoot me down
It's murder
It's murder
It's bloody murder
This is laced in razor blades tonight
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
Stupid cupid's wicked game delight
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
A diamond studded bullet right thru my heart
Golden teardrops in the dark
Pull it right thru my heart
You pulled the trigger in the name of love tonight
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
Click clack
Bang bang
You shot me to the ground
I took a bullet toi the heart
You kicked me down
Click clack
Bang bang
And now you're on the run
I never thought that love could kill me like a gun
Oooh, time is running out
Oooh, my heart is bleeding now
Click clack
Bang bang
Oh, you shoot me down
It's murder
It's murder
It's bloody murder.
