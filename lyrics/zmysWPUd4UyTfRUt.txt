We're setting sail
To the place on the map
From which no one has ever returned
Drawn by the promise of the joker and the fool
By the light of the crosses that burn
Drawn by the promise of the women and the lace
And the gold and the cotton and pearls
It's the place where they keep all the darkness you need
You sail away from the light of the world
On this trip, baby

You will pay tomorrow
You're gonna pay tomorrow, yeah
You will pay tomorrow

Save me
Save me from tomorrow
I don't want to sail with this ship of fools, no, no, no
Oh, save me
Save me from tomorrow
I don't want to sail with this ship of fools, no, no, no

I want to run and hide
Right now

Avarice and greed
Are gonna drive you over the endless sea
They will leave you drifting in the shallows
Or drowning in the oceans of history
Traveling the world, you're in search of no good
But I'm sure you'll build your Sodom, like you knew you would
Using all the good people for your galley slaves
As your little boat struggles through the warning waves

But you don't pay
You will pay tomorrow
You're gonna pay tomorrow, yeah
You gonna pay tomorrow

Save me
Save me from tomorrow
I don't want to sail with this ship of fools, no, no, no, no
Oh, save me
Save me from tomorrow
I don't want to sail with this ship of fools, no, no, no, no

Where's it coming from?
Oh, where's it going to?
It's just a
It's just a ship of fools

Here we go
All aboard
