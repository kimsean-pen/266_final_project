Fell like a child, bittersweet
You've got me twisted in my sheets
Our love is wasted on the road
Back of the van when I'm dreaming of home

Now that I know that
I got nothing to fear

Well I get so low, tell me you miss me
Have you ever been alone in a crowded city?
I get down, you take me back to when
The world was rushing by me
I didn't have a care

Fell from the lights, in too deep
They sucked you into the silver screen
Top of the skyline spelt our names
Put down the phone you were never saved

Now that I know that
I got nothing to fear

Well I get so low, tell me you miss me
Have you ever been alone in a crowded city?
I get down, you take me back to when
The world was rushing by me
I didn't have a care

Well I get so low
Well I get so low
Well I get so low
Well I get so low

Well I get so low, tell me you miss me
Have you ever been alone in a crowded city?
I get down, you take me back to when
The world was rushing by me
I didn't wanna
Get so low, tell me you miss me
Have you ever been alone in a crowded city?
I get down, you take me back to when
The world was rushing by me
I didn't have a care
