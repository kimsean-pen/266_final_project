How did it get to 3 am?
I wish that I could call
But I know that you're probably asleep
Do I really have to get used
To being alone again?
I wish that you were here
You must know that you are my best friend
Do we really have to dream?
I'm perfectly happy here
In reality, I'm wide awake
I think about the things
That I can do tomorrow and I'm trapped
Cause it's so dark outside and everybody else is fast asleep
My hand is glued to the remote
The TV has already slept
Good night, I'm frozen in my sleep
I want to move but I'm afraid
I suffer from anxiety
And I don't want to be alone!
You see, I want to be with

You
You ooh ooh
You ooh ooh
You ooh ooh
Yeah baby

You are the one I think of all the night
And all the night it feels so right
I miss your arms
The way you kiss me
The way you pull me in so tight
It makes me sick the way we'd fight
And I want you so bad tonight

Yeah baby

You are the one I think of all the night
And all the night it feels so right
I miss your arms
The way you kiss me
The way you pull me in so tight
It makes me sick the way we'd fight
And I want you so bad tonight

I want to change my need to want
With my desire to change my room
Passion is tricky, love is tender
Love is sweet, it hurts you and me
And in my fatal judgment
Cut off my electricity
And now I'm really stunned
I'll make forever, make forever
Leave the house to stop me crying
And if you cry, you're taken out
There won't be room for Miss Sincere
I'm afraid this is all or nothing
And I haven't got a hope
At least I've got another friend
Turns out I was just a joke
I'm holding onto what I've got
I'm tryna get just what I want
I'll pick the pieces up tomorrow
Cut the pill and take my chances and a half
Cut the pill and take my chances
Yeah baby

You are the one I think of all the night
And all the night it feels so right
I miss your arms
The way you kiss me
The way you pull me in so tight
It makes me sick the way we'd fight
And I want you so bad tonight

Yeah baby

You are the one I think of all the night
And all the night it feels so right
I miss your arms
The way you kiss me
The way you pull me in so tight
It makes me sick the way we'd fight
And I want you so bad tonight
Yeah I need

You
You ooh ooh
You ooh ooh
You ooh ooh
You ooh ooh
You ooh ooh
You ooh ooh
