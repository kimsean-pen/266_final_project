a name
I recognise that name
It was at the center of some ticker tape parade
The lead story,
A fine example
A name, a name
A name I recognise that name
It was at the center of some magnifying glass
The lead story, a fine example
A name, a name
He used to pretend he was fighting some war somewhere
Now everything depends on fighting some war
He never thought he'd be an exclamation point
A demonstration of his disease
A punctuation mark
A household name with hiv
Still, it's just still sound
