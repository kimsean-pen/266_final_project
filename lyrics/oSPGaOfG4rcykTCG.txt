No sense no style
I said I loved you for a little while
When you cried no
High speed became go slow
Come back this time
Wishful thinking is going to make you mine
Push turns to shove
I got no more room for love

I hope you hear me
I can't stand you next to me
Get lost goodbye
I'll smile before you cry
I love you baby
Please don't hate me
You're feeling a little sad tonight but you'll be alright
