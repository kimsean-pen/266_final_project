Fall in love, fall in love, be a bee, be a bee
Little life like a tree, fall in love, be a bee

Free...

Be my bee, be a bee, so I'll be, so I'll be
Little life like a tree, so I'll be, so I'll be

Free...

And now is time, I'm still die, we will find, we will find
Maybe there, oh so high, we will find, we will find
So again you will cry, life is hot, life is hot
Live a life, you are cry, in this time you will cry

Free...

La-la, we're all alone, la-la, we're all alone
La-la, we're all alone, la-la, we're all alone, oh-oh
To all of confession (?)
