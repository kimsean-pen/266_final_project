There's a game life plays
Makes you think you're everything they ever said you were
Like to take some time
Clear away everything I've planned

Was it life I've betrayed for the shape that I'm in
It's not hard to fail, it's not easy to win
Did I drink too much, could I disappear
And there's nothing that's left but wasted years

There's nothing left but wasted years
There's nothing left but wasted years

If I could change my life
Be a simple kind of man
Try to do the best I can
If I could take the sides
I'd derail every path I could
An' I'm about to die
Won't you clear away from me
Give me strength to fly away

Was it life I've betrayed, for the shape that I'm in
It's not hard to fail, it's not easy to win
Did I drink too much, could I disappear
And there's nothing that's left but wasted years

There's nothing left but wasted years
(There's nothing left but wasted years)
There's nothing left but wasted years

Was it life I've betrayed, for the shape that I'm in
It's not hard to fail, it's not easy to win
Did I drink too much, could I disappear
And there's nothing that's left but wasted years

Was it life I've betrayed (there's nothing left but wasted years)
For the shape that I'm in (there's nothing left but wasted years)
Did I drink too much (there's nothing left but wasted years)
For those wasted years (there's nothing left but wasted years)

Was it life I've betrayed
For the shape that I'm in
It's not hard to fail
It's not easy to win
