Damaged pride and vulnerable
All my fears are open now
Never thought this would hit me so hard

Staring at my hollow phone
Not sure if you're coming home
Bed still smells like I'm not all alone again

I know we fucked it up this time
We got so high
Couldn't see the bottom

I just crashed my car
And it got me thinking of you
So I just thought I'd call
To tell you, to tell you I, to tell you I still love you

My mental image impaired
Undid the braids in my hair
I rain destruction in the fight of my inner feels

Remove the tricks of the trade
You're just alone on the stage
There's no witness fly your soul through the windshield

Damaged pride and vulnerable
All my fears are open now
Never thought I could hurt you so hard
Staring at my hollow phone
Wondering if you've found your home
Feel like I deserve to die alone again

We really fucked it up this time
Got so low
Only for a second

I just crashed my car
And it got me thinking of you
So I just thought I'd call
To tell you, to tell you I, to tell you I still love you

Take a sip from the drain
The flavor tastes like nothing
Or nothing tastes the same cause nothing is never there

I know what I'm talkin bout
Believe the words in my mouth
Cause I can say that it was all just a metaphor

You know that I wont stop (In my heart and in my own mind)
I'm coming back on top (in my soul I know that they ain't never gonna break me)
Don't call that it's a flop (In my heart and in my own mind)
I got the refs on lock (in my soul I know that they ain't never gonna break me)

(Damaged pride and vulnerable)
You know that I wont stop (In my heart and in my own mind)
I'm coming back on top (in my soul I know that they ain't never gonna break me)

(All my fears are open now)
Don't call that it's a flop (In my heart and in my own mind)
I got the refs on lock (in my soul I know that they ain't never gonna break me)
