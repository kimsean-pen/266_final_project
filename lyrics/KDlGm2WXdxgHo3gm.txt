I'm a good ole ramblin' boy
Now that's just what I am
This fair land that you call yours
I do not give a damn
I've got the ramblin' fever down in my bones
And everwhere that I wanna go
The only place that I ever loved
Is a place I left behind

Place I left behind
One more month at that steady place
A couple more days I'll be going away
There from the city with the sunny side
Is a place I left behind
Where work and money never goes dry
The girls they treat you mighty fine
Never get them off your mind
At the place I left behind

Is a place I left behind
I've got the lonesome blues everywhere I go
And everything that I need to know
The only place I can bide my time
Is a place I left behind
Way out west they don't give a damn, there's
half a woman for every man
Going back to the place that I love so much
And the girl with the softest touch

The place I left behind

I'm a good ole ramblin' boy
Now that's just what I am
This fair land that you call yours
I do not give a damn

Is a place I left behind
Place I left behind
