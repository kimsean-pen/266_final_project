She always looked at me
Through the cemetery window
She made a life of me
And it turned me off of feeling

Now, she took me by surprise
I never had the notice
I couldn't realize that there always was a window
An ordinary window

She taught her spite to me
And I never even noticed
She tried to talk to me
But I didn't want to notice

Sleep pushing down on me
(Pushing down on me)
But I just can't close my eyes
To sacrifice

Leave never to be seen
(To be seen)
Pain is never make-believe
In paradise
