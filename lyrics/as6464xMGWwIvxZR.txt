I'm still burned and my blood it creeps
I'm the sun-flooded mouth and I can learn to speak

I'm the scars upon your knees
I'm the scrapes of iron your skin breathes
I could be anything

And it was so brief
And kicking the teeth
All and out at once
Because I know how to breathe

And it was so brief
I want more time for luck
And then I go again

You're the movements in my sleep
You are the words I couldn't keep

I'm short of fuse, and watch them seep
Into the woods, you bare to bleed
I could loose everything

And it was so brief
And kicking the teeth
All and out at once
Because I know how to breathe

And it was so brief
I want more time for luck
And then I go again

You love
When I saw you
You love
When I saw you
You love
When I saw you
You love
When I saw you
