On a desert Christmas morning, 1981
One month shy of six years old
In the valley of the sun
My first two-wheel bicycle stood by the tree
My heart thumping in my chest
Though I'd tried, I couldn't ride one yet

Out on our street when my dad let go of the seat
I rode off and down the road
Somehow I never went back home

But I remember what it was like
Astride my yellow bike
First freedom, second life
All the places I could ride
Leaving early packing light
That little ache inside
My kingdom for someone to ride with

Now a highwayman who traded in his handlebars
Going back and forth
In vans and rental cars
On the 10, the 5, the 90, and the 95
In love with every stretch of road
But when I drive them on my own
They remind me what it was like
Astride that yellow bike
My kingdom for someone
Some folks are loners
And you learn from them
If you've always been a joiner
On the move again
But if you keep your legs pumping
Despite everything
Well, you can take that sting
You can make it swing

Just remember what it was like
Astride that yellow bike
First freedom, second life
All the places I could ride
Leaving early packing light
That little ache inside
My kingdom for someone to ride with
I'd trade my kingdom for someone to ride with
