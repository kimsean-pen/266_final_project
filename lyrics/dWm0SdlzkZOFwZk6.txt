Parisian skies
Shadows beneath your eyes
All we have now
(And the arc of your brow)

You came to leave these shores
An inkling in your pores
We came to bid farewell
The tears began to swell

Oh, I don't think she knew
I can't forget her

The dark withholds
And lives unfold
We always slept so well
Our bodies seemed to gel

The mind persists
We have thoughts to exist
It was a test I failed
Her passion never paled

Oh, I don't think she knew
How much I loved her
Oh, I don't think she knew

Is this the thrill of the chase?
How can I keep up the pace?

Parisian skies
Shadows beneath your eyes
We always slept so well
The presents casts a spell

You said we never talked
But there's a lightness that it brought
Refracting all my sins
We never lacked a thing

Oh, I don't think she knew
How much I loved her
Oh, I don't think she knew
Oh Rebecca, your loss was mine too

Did you ever feel the thrill of the chase?
The breath on your neck in the locked embrace
Did you ever feel the thrill of the chase?
The hairs on your neck in a lost embrace

I love the tiny veins on you back
They remind me of the way porcelain cracks
