Please, let me in, feel the pulse inside
Race the speed of the beat
Take a chance with me, a way towards something
No one knows what's to come

And I don't know the right tracks for this train
This is something I can't explain
Could you say something
And I don't know the right words I should say
Never felt anything this way
Can't you say something
And break the goddamn silence

Why do we stay here in the pouring rain
We didn't make it to the last train
And now it's up to you
It might be a tough call
We play the game to reach it all

And I don't know the right tracks for this train
This is something I can't explain
Could you say something
And I don't know the right words I should say
Never felt anything this way
Can't you say something
And break the goddamn silence.

And I don't know the right tracks for this train
This is something I can't explain
Could you say something
And I don't know the right words I should say
Never felt anything this way
Can't you say something

And I don't know the right tracks for this train
This is something I can't explain
Could you say something
And I don't know the right words I should say
Never felt anything this way
Can't you say something
And break the goddamn silence
