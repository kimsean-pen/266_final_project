Straight down the line I watch you disappear
Before my eyes saw through solid air
They said you're fine, that I shouldn't even care
But I complains
Sought to find you there

Sorry doesn't cut it for me
She isn't glide to unwind a while
Mountains rising out of my head
And i never looked this good
Never looked this good

No one ever said that you'd be back here
Now I gotta to be scared of my friend
No one ever said that you'd be back here
Now I gotta to be scared of my friend

Way down the cloud
The second that you left
Score some spice attack gonna another share
Take back the ride
And I couldn't shake the fear
While they got high
Look what's really there

Sorry doesn't cut it for me
She isn't glide to unwind a while
Mountains rising out of my head
And you never looked this good
Never looked this good

No one ever said that you'd be back here
Now I gotta to be scared of my friend
No one ever said that you'd be back here
Now I gotta to be scared of my friend

No one ever said that you'd be back here
Now I gotta to be scared of my friend
No one ever said that you'd be back here
Now I gotta to be scared of my friend
