GSpitting static right back at it
It don't matter that you got me frantic
So supreme, oh it's electric
Like a dream yeah, it's prophetic
Like a dream yeah, it's prophetic

It's a scream when you least expect it!

Sparks ignite when we collide
(I get frantic, frantic over you)
I can't seem to get you off my mind
('Cause I know that I'm so good for you)
Come on darling now's the time
(Frantic, frantic over you)
And I'm ready for the magic now
Oh yeah I'm ready for the magic

Stuck in traffic, false dramatics
It don't matter if you're playing tactics
So divine, oh it's magnetic
It's a scream when you least expect it
It's a scream when you least expect it
Like a dream yeah, it's prophetic

Sparks ignite when we collide
(Frantic, frantic over you)
I can't seem to get you off my mind
(Know that I'm so good for you)
Come on darling now's the time
(Frantic, frantic over you)
And I'm ready for the magic now
Oh yeah I'm ready for the magic

Do, do do, do do do do
Do, do do, do do do do
Do, do do, do do do do
Do, do do, do do do do
Do, do do, do do do do
Do, do do, do do do do do

Sparks ignite when we collide
(Frantic, frantic over you)
I can't seem to get you off my mind
(Know that I'm so good for you)
Come on darling now's the time
(Frantic, frantic over you)
And I'm ready for the magic now
Oh yeah I'm ready for the magic now!
