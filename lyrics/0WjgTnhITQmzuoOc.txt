Hey you, living for tomorrow,
You sold your dreams for a pocket of change.
Hey you smokin up your sorrow,
Just pointing fingers at someone to blame.

Hey you, you turn your back on your children
It's left you in the big burning bed
This life's like livin in the gutter,
All this pain just makes you feel dead.

You're just givin' it all, givin' it all away,
You're just givin' it all, givin' it all away,
Hey, hey, ey yey, y ey, ey,

Slow down just look a little closer,
You might find that it's not the end.
You wonder how your life could get better,
When you're alone you just tear yourself down.

You're just givin' it all, givin' it all away,
You're just givin' it all, givin' it all away,

You're just givin' it all, givin' it all away,
You're just givin' it all, givin' it all away,
Hey, hey, ey yey, y ey, yey,

Try and find your better half now,
Open your eyes and find yourself.

Hey girl screamin' for attention,
Once you get it you throw it away.
I'm broken, i'm pickin' up the pieces
I won't live in all your mistakes.

I'm just givin' it all, givin' it all away,
I'm just givin' it all, givin' it all away.

I'm just givin' it all, givin' it all away,
I'm just givin' it all, givin' it all away.

I'm just giving it up, givin it all away,
Hey, hey, ey yey, y ey, ey.
