I find myself in the same place again
With floors and stairs across the walls
It's like a courtyard under glass ceilings
And there's no way to go?
Outside
Nobody's watching me
Turn around, lean out of the balustrade?
Something is guiding me
Through an endless corridor
Is everything real?
The elevator in the final room
A metal square without walls
In asymmetrical trajectories
Vertical movements through trapdoors.
