I laid there, tossed to the side
The marks of your tires left no lies
Driver please don't go by that place
I couldn't deal with the world after I saw that face

Escaping from the walls you've made, impossible to win this game
Streets become an open maze I'm going (wooo)
I'm drowning, in my mind, sinking till I, fall behind
Please let me forget those nights oh I'm going - (wooo)

Walked by myself again last night
The breeze brushed my hair out from my eyes
Thoughts and my silence where my light
But nothing at all could make me feel alright

Escaping from the walls you've made, impossible to win this game
Streets become an open maze I'm going (wooo)
I'm drowning, in my mind, sinking till I, fall behind
Please let me forget those nights oh I'm going - (wooo)

I ain't trying to go back I ain't trying to go back oh no no

He ain't trying to go back he ain't trying to go back oh no no

I ain't trying to go back I ain't trying to go back oh no no

He ain't trying to go back

Escaping from the walls you've made, impossible to win this game
Streets become an open maze I'm going (wooo)
I'm drowning, in my mind, sinking till I, fall behind
Please let me forget those nights oh I'm going - (wooo)
