When it's hard to take off from the ground
When you've got no strength to fight
When you feel you're losing everything
When you've got no hope inside

You don't know who you are
And your indecisions break your heart
You know I'll come, I'll be running
To find you wherever you are

We are human beings looking for a meaning
You know you are alive as long as you're breathing
There's no limitations, hold you head with grace and
Keep on believing what you are dreaming of

I'll be the one for you to lean against
I'll get your lungs to open air
And when your tears are running from your face
I'll put you out of your despair

I'll make your shoulders strong
Put you back on the ground where you belong
It's turning bright and we rise to the sky
'Cause this is who we are

We are human beings looking for a meaning
You know you are alive as long as you're breathing
There's no limitations, just have a little patience
You will be given what you are dreaming of

This is who we are
This is who we are...

We are human beings looking for a meaning
You know you are alive as long as you're breathing
There's no limitations, hold you head with grace and
Keep on believing what you are dreaming of

We are human beings, extraordinary feelings
Sometimes it's hard but keep on believing
There's no limitations, just have a little patience
You will be given what you are dreaming of
