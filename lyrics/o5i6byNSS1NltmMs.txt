Skullcrush lay me down
Upon of a bed of nails
All good things must come to an end
The Intergalactic serve me plastic life
Go forth but the mind is a waste
Escape go forth, Escape go forth
Give me a break you give wath you take

Give me a Break
You give what you take

Refrain...
You Son of a Bitch you must be Kidding.
Serving this pile of crap.
I'm not forgiving you.
God damnit
You're only holding me back.
Get out of my way.
You son of a bitch you must be kidding.
Serving this pile of crape
I'm not forgiving you

I know i fool myself it's just a pretty face.
I know we don't belong it's such a bitter taste.
It's not just empty words it's how we're feeling justified punishment.
Judgement is bleeding through.

Refrain...
You Son of a Bitch you must be Kidding.
Serving this pile of crap.
I'm not forgiving you.
God damnit
You're only holding me back.
Get out of my way.
You son of a bitch you must be kidding.
Serving this pile of crape
I'm not forgiving you.

Sacrifice nails going through my eyes.
Disguised as a passion for etfrnal life.
I know you feel it, trying to control it.
I know you feel it, you can't control it.
I know you feel it, trying to control it.
I know you feel it but you can't control it.

Refrain...
You Son of a Bitch you must be Kidding.
Serving this pile of crap.
I'm not forgiving you.
God damnit
You're only holding me back.
Get out of my way.
You son of a bitch you must be kidding.
Serving this pile of crape
I'm not forgiving you
God damnit
You're only holding me back.
Get out of my way.

Get out of my way

Get out of my way

God damnit

GET OUT OF MY WAY
