Sitting on the edge of another day
Waiting on the sun to rise
All that I can hear are the thoughts you're thinking
Making up with all of my enemies
Memories I don't like
I'm tired of the feeling of your heart breaking

You will live for me
Helping me get through
All my failures, my glories
You've been holding on
For the both of us
You have always been strong
When I'm never strong enough

My greatest mistake
Is that I never let it show
These feelings I feel
But God I hope you know
How much I love you
I'm never gonna let you go
Let you go
Hey

You picked me up
When I was down
When I was lost
You came and found me
You took the pieces of my heart
When they had all broken apart

You were there for me
Helping me get through
All my failures, my glories
You've been holding on
For the both of us
You have always been strong
When I'm never strong enough

My greatest mistake
Is that I never let it show
These feelings I feel
But God I hope you know
How much I love you
I'm never gonna let you go
Let you go
Hey

We've gotta keep on keeping together
It's just me and you
We've gotta keep on keeping together
If we're gonna make it through

My greatest mistake
Is that I never let it show
These feelings I feel
But God I hope you know
How much I love you
I'm never gonna let you go
Let you go
Hey

Helping me get through
All my failures, my glories
You've been holding on
For the both of us
You have always been strong
When I'm never strong enough

My greatest mistake
Is that I never let it show
These feelings I feel
But God I hope you know
How much I love you
I'm never gonna let you go
Let you go
Hey
