Hey Hey don't pay no mind,
We are the second, you're minutes behind
So you say, Yea I'm alright
You are the fortunate all the time
Yea, you are the fortunate...

I've been looking for a way out
Something that isn't so cruel
Well I'm a little tired, you see
Complacent and miserable
I think you're missing out
I think you're dumbing it down
You're past the point of holding up to your words,
There's no getting it by us now
So if it's OK by you,

Hey Hey don't pay no mind,
We are the second, you're minutes behind
So you say, "Yea I'm alright"
You are the fortunate all the time

So full of this adventure
The feelings insecure
It's so easy, push the pin, fake the tense
And give us nothing more
And if it's OK by you,

Hey Hey don't pay no mind,
We are the second, you're minutes behind
So you say, Yea I'm alright
You are the fortunate all the time

And if it's the one thing
That I've been sure of,
Well its OK, I know you've got the time
If it's all one in the same thing
Then I've been waiting for the fallout with history
But it's got on for so long, for so long
That I don't think you'll ever be the same

Hey Hey don't pay no mind,
We are the second, you're minutes behind
So you say, Yea I'm alright
You are the fortunate all the time

Hey Hey don't pay no mind,
We are the second, you're minutes behind
So you say, Yea I'm alright
You are the fortunate all the time

Hey Hey (don't pay no mind)
Heyo heyyy (we are the second, you're minutes behind)
Heyo heyo heyyyo (So you say, "Yea I'm alright")
Heyo Heyoooo Heyooo (You are the fortunate all the time)
