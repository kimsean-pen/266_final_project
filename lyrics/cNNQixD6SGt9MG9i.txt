I cry but I can't buy
Your Veteran's Day poppy
It don't get me high
It can only make me cry
It can never grow another
Son like the one who warmed me my days
After rain and warmed my breath
My life's blood

Screamin' empty she crys
It don't get me high
It can only make me cry
Your Veteran's Day poppy.
