My words are wrapped in barbwire
My actions speak for what I can't say
Cuz I fall one step forward
To push you away, push you away

I wish that I could listen
To all the advice that I give away
But it's hard to see things clearly
Through all of the pain, all of the pain

I'm caught in the rain, caught in the rain

And my heart's too drunk to drive
I should stay away from you tonight
But in this blackout state of mind
Baby, all I want is you tonight

When my head tells me "no"
My heart tells me "go"
So I'm hitting in the road cuz I

I know my heart's too drunk to drive
But I'm on my way to you
Yea, I'm on my way
To you, you, to you tonight
I'm on my way to you, you
To you, I'm on my way to you

Yea, there's a million voices
Screaming that this love's a dead-end road
But the only voice that I hear
Is telling me "go", telling me "go"

The sun is rising sober
While passion fades and I'm on my own
My helpless heart's hung over
I'm all out of hope, all out of hope

Where do we go? Where do we go?

Cuz my heart's too drunk to drive
I should stay away from you tonight
But in this blackout state of mind
Baby, all I want is you tonight

When my head tells me "no"
My heart tells me "go"
So I'm hitting the road cuz I

I know my heart's too drunk to drive
But I'm on my way to you
Yea, I'm on my way
To you, you, to you tonight
I'm on my way to you, you
To you, I'm on my way

And no wise words can stop me
I'm past the point of no return
No matter how it hurts me
I'm running to you, running to you

And my heart's too drunk to drive
I should stay away from you tonight
But in this blackout state of mind
Baby, all I want is you tonight

When my head tells me "no"
My heart tells me "go"
So I'm hitting the road 'cuz I

I know my heart's too drunk to drive
But I'm on my way to you
Yea, I'm on my way
To you, you, to you tonight
I'm on my way to you, you
To you, I'm on my way to you
