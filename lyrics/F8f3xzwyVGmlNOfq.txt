Did you feel it when we first kissed
Fun little feeling like you're falling?
Did you feel like a little kid?
'Cause I did
When we woke up every morning
Could you feel the best feeling?
Feeling like you're flying
'Cause I did

But the truth is that you
You didn't wanna fall in love
I guess I knew it from the start
But I never told my heart

'Cause now I feel like I'm losing my mind over nothing
'Cause nothing is what we are
But why does a nothing feel like something?
Every time you come around
My heart goes pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-ada
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-ada
I try so hard but it won't stop
Pop-ada pop-ada
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-ada
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-ada
I try so hard but it won't stop
Pop-ada

Was it something that I said to you
Or was it something you just couldn't do?
Did you get everything you wanted to?
Hope you did
When I asked you what was going on
You acted like there was nothing wrong
Did you know that you were good as gone?
Wish I did

But the truth is that you
You didn't wanna fall in love
I guess I knew it from the start
But I never told my heart

'Cause now I feel like I'm losing my mind over nothing
'Cause nothing is what we are
But why does a nothing feel like something?
Every time you come around
My heart goes pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-ada
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-ada
I try so hard but it won't stop
Pop-ada pop-ada
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-ada
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-ada
I try so hard but it won't stop
Pop-ada

I know it's nothing but I feel like I'm missing something
I know it's nothing but I feel like I'm missing something
I know it's nothing but I feel like I'm missing something
I know it's nothing but I feel like I'm missing something

'Cause now I feel like I'm losing my mind over nothing
'Cause nothing is what we are
But why does a nothing feel like something?
Every time you come around
My heart goes pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-ada
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-ada
I try so hard but it won't stop
Pop-ada pop-ada
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-ada
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-ada
I try so hard but it won't stop
Pop-ada
