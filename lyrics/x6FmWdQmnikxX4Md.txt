Ah, ah ah ah ah, ah
I was fine before I met you
I was broken but fine
I was lost and uncertain
But my heart was still mine
I was free before I met you
I was broken but free
All alone in a clear view
But now you are all I see

Hey, wait a minute
No, you can't do this to me
Hey, wait a minute
No, that's not fair
Hey, wait a minute
You're on me like jewelry
I really like it
But I'm so scared

Ooh, why'd you have to go and make me like you?
This is a feeling I'm not used to
Ooh, why'd you have to go and make me like you?
I'm so mad at you
Cause now you got me missing you
Ah, ah ah ah ah, ah
Cause now you got me missing you

Something I could get used to
I could get used this
It's getting harder to leave it
Your lips on my lips

Oh, I can't believe it
How good it could be
Didn't want to believe it
But now you are all I see

Hey, wait a minute
No, you can't do this to me
Hey, wait a minute
No, that's not fair
Hey, wait a minute
You're on me like jewelry
I really like it
But I'm so scared

Ooh, why'd you have to go and make me like you?
This is a feeling I'm not used to
Ooh, why'd you have to go and make me like you?
I'm so mad at you
Cause now you got me missing you

Ooh, why'd you have to go and make me like you?
This is a feeling I'm not used to
Ooh, why'd you have to go and make me like you?
I'm so mad at you
Cause now you got me missing you

Oh God, thank God that I found you
Oh God, cause now you got me missing you
Oh God, thank God that I found you
I'm so mad at you
Cause now you got me missing you

Thank God
Thank God that I found you
Oh, now you got me missing you
Now you got me missing you!

Ooh, why'd you have to go and make me like you?
This is a feeling I'm not used to
Ooh, why'd you have to go and make me like you?
I'm so mad at you
Cause now you got me missing you

Ooh, why'd you have to go and make me like you?
This is a feeling I'm not used to
Ooh, why'd you have to go and make me like you?
I'm so mad at you
Cause now you got me missing you
Oh God, thank God that I found you
Oh God, cause now you got me missing you
Oh God, thank God that I found you
I'm so mad at you
Cause now you got me missing you
