Yeah, this is
Yeah, come on
Go!

(Wave)
(Wave, wave)
(Wave, wave)

Let's go to an island
Like we did last year, catch a vibe
The dreamiest weather
Come do a smile that [light?] my fires

I got on rose-colored glasses
Battin' your eyelashes
Come on, don't be passive
Some "us time" would be magic

Oooh!
This is fantastic
And we could get some practice
And miles on our passes for love

Would you believe, we're alone?
So far from home, but you love it though
Set yourself free, in the zone
Ain't got no phone, don't need it though

'Cause it ain't got no waves (Waves)
Waves (Waves)
Waves (Waves)
Waves (Waves)

And just wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)

Now the other wave (Wave)
Now the other wave (Wave)
Now the other wave (Wave)
Now the other wave (Wave)
Now the other wave (Wave)
Now the other wave (Wave)
Now the other wave (Wave)
Now the other wave (Wave)
(Uh, hey)

Let's do some more riding
I'll catch a couple fish, then we can dine
Look, we're getting better
Aging like your favorite wine

I've got on rose-colored glasses
Battin' your eyelashes
Come on, don't be passive
Some "us time" would be magic

Oooh!
This is fantastic
And we could get some practice
And miles on our passes for love

Would you believe, we're alone?
So far from home, but you love it though
Set yourself free, in the zone
Ain't got no phone, don't need it though

'Cause it ain't got no waves (Waves)
Waves (Waves)
Waves (Waves)
Waves (Waves)

And just wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)

(Wave)
(Wave, wave)
(Wave)
(Wave, wave)

I swear that you (Yeah, we're goin')
Summer's time, my favorite pursuit (Yeah, we're goin')
Bring your ring of shades, no need for shoes (Yeah, we're goin')
All I need is your skin and the air

I swear to you (Go babe, go babe)
Summer's time,
my favorite pursuit (Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)
Bring your ring of shades, no need for shoes (Go babe, go babe)
All I need is your skin and the air (Let's go, let's go, let's go)

(Wave, wave)
(Wave, wave)
(Wave, wave)
(Wave, wave, wave, wave)

(Wave, wave)
