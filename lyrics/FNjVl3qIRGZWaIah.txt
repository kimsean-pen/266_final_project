You were bad before you left a good life
To chase the palm trees swaying in the light
Do you say what you mean
You are only sixteen
And it goes
And it goes

Know that you're really not a dancer
But could it be the other people's smiles
They are two faced in the mirror
No vacation from here
And you go
And you go

The arrangement of lies
In a party of smiles
Make a good one, do it right
The arrangement of lies

Know that you're really not a dancer
But could it be the other people's smiles
So you make a choice to leave the good life
To chase the palm trees swaying in the night
What you see in your mind
Look outside in dark light
And you go
And it goes

The arrangement of lies
In a party of smiles
Make a good one, do it right
The arrangement of lies
