I know that things are getting tougher
When you can't get the top off from the bottom of the barrel
Wide-open the road of my future now
It's looking fucking narrow

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing

We get told to decide
Just like, as if
I'm not gonna change my mind

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing

Whatcha gonna do with yourself?
Boy, you better make up your mind
Whatcha gonna do with yourself?
You're running out of time

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing

And that's fine
