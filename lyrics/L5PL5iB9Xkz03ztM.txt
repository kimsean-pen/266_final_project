Ride withered days unfiring the sun,
the nights were soft and cloudless,
the saddened will "be gone"
and winds did lays in forest,
and dawn was filled with eerie sweetness
in days before the fall.

Fight with our hearts and oceans were young
the times were full of magic
and seed with songs unsung,
and winds did lays in forest,
and dawn was filled with eerie sweetness
in days before the fall.

The sweetness, the hacks, now water restrain,
and silently we wallow in memory of the day,
when winds did lays in forest,
and dawn was filled with eerie sweetness
in days before the fall.

Ride withered days unfiring the sun,
the nights were soft and cloudless,
the silent were begone,
and winds did lays in forest,
and dawn was filled with eerie sweetness
in days before the fall...
