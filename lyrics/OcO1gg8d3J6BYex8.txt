I thought i'd grow out my hair,
to see if you'd notice.
and I'd start dressing nice,
to make you believe that I'm alright.
and I'd start playing sports,
to be more like my brother,
and my dad might be proud,
for once in his life.

Or maybe I'll drink myself to sleep,
because that's what I'm used to,
and when I wake up,
I'll feel brand new.

I'll start tanning my skin,
to be more like my mother,
because I am a ghost
in size small clothes,
and I guess I could use some color.
Maybe I'll smile
to be like my ex-girlfriends,
because they can feel love
and I can't feel anything.

So I thought i'd write you this song,
so you could get noticed.
You could sing it along with your friends,
in the back of their Mercedes-Benz.

Well, me and my Volvo will be fine,
and maybe I'll close my eyes to feel more like myself,
and maybe I'll close my eyes to feel more like myself,
and maybe i'll close my eyes to feel more like myself.
