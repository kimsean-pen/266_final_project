Stretching out cheap cotton over your thick skull
Oh I do feel awful on the way to school
Can you picture my reaction to the word up on the wall?
Is there really something wrong with me?

Stretching out cheap cotton over your thick skull
I'm down here under the pavement so inept until
I grab that pen beside you jam it into your eye
See, now you're my kind of man, now you're a stand up kind of guy

I am dying of embarrassment, I'm dying of this hatred
I can't rest until you know this bitterness that I have tasted
Such humiliation for the first and only time
I'm obsessed with your self-righteousness cut in half by your smile

Into the night, you're getting harder to believe in
You're a cold and quiet paradise transfixed just by your breathing
Into the night, and you're the one thing I don't hate,
You're a cold and quiet paradise my only true escape into the night.
