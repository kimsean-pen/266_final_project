Look at a life
And the one beside
Now look the other way
These futures forming
From the get go day one
Will be better than
Or is expected to be
Tell me who's fortunate
Incendiary remark my words
They shouldn't mean a thing
Even with how mean I like to be

Come rake me over
New form of torture
One more time
I'll do it to mine
And look the other way

You'll never measure up
Up up and away
Way beyond anywhere you think
You'll be able to reach higher
Everything is about getting higher
Farther, faster, bigger, better
Way bigger than you'll ever be
You tiny little swine
Offer nothing kind to anyone
Should've never been not good enough
Look at that It's awful remarks
My words stockpile
Short fuse
Fusillade
Combustion
Bust open
Comparison
Tell me who's fortune you want

This California
Kind of torture
Where the sun shines
All the time
Can I just look away?

Way beyond comparison
If that exists
I'll meet you there
Way upon the stairs I've floated up...

When it began
Run comparison
Damage in other ways
Abilities, fortunes
Outcome pear shaped
Off course mistakes
Everything better than
They really did a number on you

One more time
I'll walk on the mine
I looked the other way

Way beyond wildest imaginations
You can be, you can be
Way above the stars I'm wishing on
There's always higher, there's always higher

Way beyond comparison
This one, that one
Way above the stars we're shooting for
You can see
You can see
