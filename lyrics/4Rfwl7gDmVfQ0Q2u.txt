Black night, white lane
Free up, make rain, oh
We so about it!

Sun down, gold chain
My cup, my Jane, oh
We so about it

We live in the jungle
We cocky but humble
You don't wanna rumble
Speak up bitch don't mumble

You want it - you got it
Supply for the party
Bitch, I'll be your preacher
I get this shit started

Cause when the clock strikes 12
I'm a set it off just like I wanna
Baby, when the clock strikes 12
We gon' turn it up don't tell your mama

We so about it!
Yeahehehehehe
We so about it!

White noise, propane
Black doors, no name
We so about it!

Red lips no taste
Red eyes no hay
We so about it

I don't got pajamas
I do what I wanna
I'm out for the night, yeah
I'll sleep in the corner

I live in these streets
I don't care if they're haunted
It's hot on my block
If you slip you're a goner

Cause when the clock strikes 12
I'm a set it off just like I wanna
Baby, when the clock strikes 12
We gon' turn it up don't tell your mama

We so about it!
Yeahehehehehe
We so about it!
Yeahehehehehe
We so about it!

The clock strikes 12
All the freaks come out and play
And when the clock strikes 12
We gon' ride it like a train

Don't you wanna ride with me
Come baby, come and ride my traiiiin
You wanna ride with me

Cause when the clock strikes 12
I'm a set it off just like I wanna
Baby, when the clock strikes 12
We gon' turn it up don't tell your mama

We so about it!
Yeahehehehehe
We so about it!
Yeahehehehehe
We so about it!

We so about it!
