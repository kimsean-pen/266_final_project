I know that we are young
And I know you may love me
But I just can't be with you
Like this anymore, Glissandra

She's got both hands
In her pocket
And she won't look at you
Won't look at you

She hides true love
En su bolsillo
She's got a halo 'around her finger
Around you

You know that I love you, boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Glissandra
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Starla

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Tristessa

Glissandra
Glissandra
Gle-ny-sandra
Gle-ny-sandra
(Just stop, please just let me go
Glissandra, just let me go)

She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like a dad
Just like a dad

And all those flames
That burned before him
Now he's gonna fight your fight
Gonna cool the bad

You know that I love you, boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Glissandra
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Starla

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Tristessa

Glissandra
Glissandra
Gle-ny-sandra
Gle-ny-sandra
Gle-ny-sandra

Don't bother me
Don't bother me, Glissandra
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Starla

I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Glissandra

Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch, Starla
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Glissandra

I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Starla

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Tristessa

Glissandra
