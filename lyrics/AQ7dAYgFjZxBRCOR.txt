Sun come up it was blue and gold
Sun come up it was blue and gold
Sun come up it was blue and gold
Ever since I put your picture In a frame.
I come calling in my Sunday best
I come calling in my Sunday best
I come calling in my Sunday best
Ever since I put your picture
In a frame
I'm gonna love you
Till the wheels come off
Oh yeah
I love you baby and I always will
I love you baby and I always will
I love you baby and I always will
Ever since I put your picture In a frame
