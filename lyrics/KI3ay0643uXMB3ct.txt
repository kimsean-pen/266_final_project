I leave behind this sentiment to the man that I'll become
Telling him not to be burdened by the things that I have done
The longest days and endless nights have become the routine
Far beyond frustration, it's the end to all my means

Constantly incomplete

With my back against the wall
I stack brick by brick by brick by brick
I will rise above them all
Like this, like this, like this, like this
With my back against the wall
I stack brick by brick by brick by brick
I will rise above them all like this, like this

I may not be forgiven, but I forgave and I'll forget
Going through the motions is no way to exist
So if there's anybody out there that's so sick of feeling alone
Has the damage already been done?
You gotta get from underneath that gun

We walk before we run

With my back against the wall
I stack brick by brick by brick by brick
I will rise above them all
Like this, like this, like this, like this
With my back against the wall
I stack brick by brick by brick by brick
I will rise above them all like this, like this

Move me, choose me, please before you lose me
Find me, drive me, end the things that pride me
Move me, improve me, ignite the flame that ruled me
Guide me, collide me, I need something to survive me

With my back against the wall
I will rise above them all, like this

Coming back against all odds
I stack brick by brick by brick by brick
I will rise above them all
Like this, like this, like this, like this
Coming back against all odds
I stack brick by brick by brick by brick
I will rise above them all like this, like this
