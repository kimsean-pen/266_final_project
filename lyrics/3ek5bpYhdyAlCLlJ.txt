I turned up with my cap on back to front,
Trying to be someone I saw on TV once.
You were sitting by the window looking out for me.
We were trying to find a way to say Hi,
That didn't seem strange but it didn't work out.
Maybe that was just the way that it felt to me.

It's taken me so long.
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it.
We could be more than friends,
But maybe I'm just too shy.

Walking home down the Uxbridge road,
Headphones on I got a cigarette rolled.
I know I shouldn't light it cause I haven't smoked one for weeks.
Conversations running through my head,
Till I get stuck on one thing you should not have said but you said,
And now it's all that I can thing about.

It's taken me so long.
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it.
We could be more than friends,
But maybe I'm just too shy.

Let's go find a corner we can sit it.
And talk about that film instead of us.
Even though throughout it I was thinking,
I was gonna say I Love you afterwards.

It's taken me so long.
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it.
We could be more than friends,
But maybe I'm just too shy.
