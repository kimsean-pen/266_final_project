Come, take from me, the things that I could never
seem to find the way to push from my mouth.
The doubt is inescapable and all around.
In a liar's throne I spoke a specious truth.
Upon my face I wore a mask crafted for you.

Bricks and mortar built these walls
so I could keep this hidden until now.
The ground trembles underneath my feet
before it all comes crashing down.
I'm a liar and a fool.
In my deceit I built a prison around you.
Pray for me.

You took from me, the things that I could never
seem to find the way to make myself confess.
Believe me when I say I tried my hardest.
