Glitch in my hand
I'm determined to withstand
Cause overgrown
Infiltrating baritone

Black mountain dew
From my temper, for my truth
Tall apogee
I'm assembled, finally

Save the part you wrote, I want to escape night
All my emptiness should wither in famed light
Save the part below my dissolving eyes and bones

This is the grand borderline
I'm losing my grip every time

This is the grand borderline
(Whaler)
I'm losing my grip every time
(Whaler)
Every time

Save the part you wrote, I want to escape night
All my emptiness should wither in famed light
Save the part below my scenario
Save the part you wrote, I want to escape night
All my emptiness should wither in famed light
Save the part below my dissolving eyes and bones
