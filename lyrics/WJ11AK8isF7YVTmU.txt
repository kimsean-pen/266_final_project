Once in a while, oh the cold it is so hard to beat
In every smile, there's a hole and it's so ornery
We'll play at trust, but it's tough and there's no guarantee
Will there be an "us"? Or will it be a "you" and a "me"?
Feel the rush of rupture
Feel the rush of rupture
Dizzying eruption
Dizzying eruption
Feel the rush of rupture
Feel the rush of rupture
Feeling closer closer
I love you love you love you

And when it ends, we will reach a chaotic appeal
Don't have to pretend that we know how to be, how to feel
With every try, there's a shame, there's a trust, there's a love
Now you are sans life, and I'd give anything to be us
Feel the rush of rupture
Feel the rush of rupture
Bleed into another
Bleed into another
Feel the rush of rupture
Feel the rush of rupture
Reeling closer closer
Your absolute surrender
