Wear the face of an angel
Disguise all the shame
Your innocent smile won't
conceal the mistakes
You think you're so clever
You think you got it all worked out
You can't hide forever

Cause I know what you did
I know where you've been
and I don't want to hear your sick excuses
I know who you are
Don't try and pretend
you made your bed now lie in it

Hey little Liar, Liar You think the world understands
Liar, Liar
You've got the blood on your hands

You might be convincing
There's no fooling me
No rest for the guilty
No room to believe
What we had doesn't matter
and I don't want work it out
It's already over

Cause I know what you did
I know where you've been
and I don't want to hear your sick excuses
I know who you are
Don't try and pretend
you made your bed now lie in it

Hey little Liar, Liar You think the world understands
Liar, Liar
You've got the blood on your hands
Liar, Liar
You think the world understands
Liar, Liar
You've got the blood on your ...

The devil living inside you
And twisting the truth
Liar, Liar, Liar
They're calling you
Liar, Liar

I know what you did
I know where you've been
and I don't want to hear your sick excuses
I know who you are
Don't try and pretend
you made your bed now lie in it

Hey little Liar, Liar You think the world understands
Liar, Liar
You've got the blood on your hands

Hey little Liar, Liar
you think the world understands
Liar, Liar
You've got the blood on your hands

You've got the blood on your hands
