Oh Mr. Pleasant,
how is Mrs. Pleasant?
I hope the world is treating you right
And your head's in the air
and you're feeling so proud
'Cause you're such a success
and the whole wide world is on your side,
hey, hey
How are you today?

People said Mr. Pleasant is good
Mr. Pleasant is kind,
Mr. Pleasant's okay
Mr. Pleasant don't mind
As long as Mr. Pleasant's all right,
hey, hey
How are you today?

How's your father, how's your mother?
How's your sister, how's your brother?
How's your brand new limousine?
Twenty-four inch TV screen?
Did you like prosperity
more than you liked poverty?
Life is easier, so much easier,
life is easier now

Oh Mr. Pleasant,
how is Mrs. Pleasant?
Did you know she was flirting around
With another young man?
And he's taking her out
when you have to work late
And it's not so pleasant after all,
hey, hey
How are you today?

People said Mr. Pleasant is good (Mr. Pleasant is good)
Mr. Pleasant is kind (Mr. Pleasant is kind)
Mr. Pleasant's okay (Mr. Pleasant's okay)
Mr. Pleasant don't mind
As long as Mr. Pleasant's all right,
hey, hey
How are you today?

Mr. Pleasant is good
Mr. Pleasant is kind
Mr. Pleasant's okay
Hey, hey
How are you today?
