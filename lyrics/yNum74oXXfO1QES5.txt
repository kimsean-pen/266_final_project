Whatchugot?
Oh
Keep it Going
Hey Toscanini, can you make me swoon?
I like the oboe but I love the bassoon
Some Morricone would light the flamb√©
Get down and dirty and I might wanna stay
Whatchugot? (whatchugot)
Mister, mister,
gave me something real hot
(gave me something real hot)
Whatchugot? (whatchugot)
Keep it going 'til I tell you to stop
('til I tell you to stop)
I want a love practitioner
A fun commissioner
An all night finisher
Let's have a ball
So whatchugot?
Whatchugot
Whatchugot, hmm
I like Puccini with some midnight wine
Are you Italian 'cause you're dressed so fine?
Where's your Ferrari, is it parked out back?
I'd like to see it, is it shiny and black?
Hey Leonardo, can you play me a song?
I'll sing the words but I'll get them all wrong
I'll be original, I'll promise you that
My love's the pinnacle, there's no turning back

Whatchugot? (whatchugot)
Mister, mister
gave me something real hot
(gave me something real hot, yeah)
Whatchugot? (whatchugot)
Keep it going 'til I tell you to stop
('til I tell you to stop)
I want a love practitioner
A fun commissioner
An all night finisher
Let's have a ball
So whatchugot?
Whatchugot, mister?
Oh whatchugot, mister, mister, mister
Whatchugot?
Let's have it
You can call me crazy, that's my middle name
I like Sambuca, baby, let's set the world aflame
You can call me crazy, that's my middle name
I like Sambuca, baby, let's set the world aflame
You can call me crazy, that's my middle name
I like Sambuca, baby, let's set the world aflame
You can call me crazy, that's my middle name
I like Sambuca, baby
Whatchugot? (whatchugot)
Mister, mister,
gave me something real hot
