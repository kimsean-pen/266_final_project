If you don't care then
Why do you stay?
What do you feel when
There's nothing there?

What do I look like
In your sad eyes?
Am I someone you
Can recognize?

It's hard to tell from
So far away
Those feelings that was
Now gone anyway

What do I look like
In your sad eyes?
Am I someone you
Can recognize?

In those sad eyes
Those sad eyes

What do I look like
In your sad eyes?
Am I someone you
Can recognize?

In those sad eyes
Ooh, You got some sad eyes
