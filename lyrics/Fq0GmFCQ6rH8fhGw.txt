Cold night, strange dreams
Memory stuck like glue
Her face, her voice
Sail across the seas with you
Can you hear all the angels?

When you feel like you're out there on your own
Know there is someone watching over you
When out at sea, feels love can let go
Oh sailor, we will blow the wind right
But if you die out there, tearing you into two
I hope you know that you could sail right on
I hope you know you got the ocean blue

No sound worse than silence
A curse that grows
Big words kept in
Whispers of dreams untold
Just don't fight all the angels

When you feel like you're out there on your own
Know there is someone watching over you
When out at sea, feels love can let go
Oh sailor, we will blow the wind right
But if you die out there, tearing you into two
I hope you know that you could sail right on
I hope you know you got the ocean blue

When you feel like you're out there on your own
Know there is someone watching over you
When out at sea, feels love can let go
Oh sailor, we will blow the wind right
But if you die out there, tearing you into two
I hope you know that you could sail right on
I hope you know you got the ocean blue

When you feel like you're out there on your own
Know there is someone watching over you
When out at sea, feels love can let go
Oh sailor, we will blow the wind right
But if you die out there, breaking you into two
I hope you know that you could sail right on
I hope you know you got the ocean blue
