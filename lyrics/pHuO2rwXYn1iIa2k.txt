I don't wanna say what I got on my mind
'Cause nothing tonight wants to come out on time
The truth is I'd rather sit out and unwind
Let somebody else tell their story this time
I wonder what happened to give me the right

To step on a platform and pick up a mic
And tell you the way to be living your life
'Cause all my credentials were lies
You've had your say

Now take your seat
I know my place
You don't know me
I'll probably end up in flames

Before the end of the night
Watch me burn in the fire
Watch me bid you goodbye
Your words fall right off the page like they fall on deaf ears
You know that it's over
Nothing left for you here
(Nothing left for you here)
I waited too long letting people like you,

tell me what they want and what I shouldn't do.

So mark me with words, but you can't tie my hands
There's nothing I'll say to make you understand
I know who I am
I know where I'll end up: in flames and that's fine
'Cause I'm finally fed up
Stick with what I started, don't care how it hurts

The loudest get shot, at the worst
You've had your say
Now take your seat
I know my place
You don't know me

I'll probably end up in flames

Before the end of the night
Watch me burn in the fire
Watch me bid you goodbye

Your words fall right off the page like they fall on deaf ears
You know that it's over
Nothing left for you here
(Nothing left for you here)
You know I'll never fold like you're the authority
I won't throw my hands up like you're the authority
You know I'll never fold like you're the authority
I won't throw my hands up like you're the authority

I'll probably end up in flames

Before the end of the night
Watch me burn in the fire
Watch me bid you goodbye
Your words fall right off the page like they fall on deaf ears
You know that it's over
Nothing left for you here
I'll probably end up in flames
Before the end of the night
Watch me burn in the fire
Watch me bid you goodbye
Your words fall right off the page
Like they fall on deaf ears
You know that it's over
Nothing left for you here
(Nothing left for you here)
