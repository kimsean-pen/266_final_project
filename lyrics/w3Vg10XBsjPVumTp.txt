Sometimes when I'm mad
There's a part of me that seems to be a little sad
Sometimes when I scream
Theres a voice in me that says, you shouldn't be so mean
Oh no, oh no
Part of me is acting while the other stands beside
Yes, I am to myself what Jekyll must have been to Hyde

We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes were a hit together
Me and I
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
Me and I

I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And you'll find the answer in it
Everyones a freak

Sometimes I have toyed
With ideas that I got from good old Dr. Freud
Nothing new of course
It may seem to you I try to break through open doors
Oh no, oh no
I just wanna say a lot of that applies to me
'Cause it's an explanation to my split identity

We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes were a hit together
Me and I
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
Me and I

I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And you'll find the answer in it
Everyones a freak

Me and I...

We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes were a hit together
Me and I
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
Me and I

I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And you'll find the answer in it
Everyones a freak

We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes were a hit together
Me and I
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
Me and I
