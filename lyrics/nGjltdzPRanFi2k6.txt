I let you sleep in, let the sun beat through
I sound like a creep but I love watching you
Cause when nobody's around
That's when you and I we own this town

When there's no more blues
And my lungs feel bruised
When we get into bed
And our love's transfused
Oh when nobody's around
That's when you and I we own this town

When we stumble down the beach
And spit at the moon
Resting in the sand
With our loveless group
Fear of nothing, our hearts are blue
You're my heart's boom
Together our hearts coo
Sweet as lovers too
You and I and the moon

Aaahh

I let you sleep in, let the sun beat through
I sound like a creep but I love watching you
Cause when nobody's around
That's when you and I we own this town
We own this town
Nobody around
Just you and I
Nobody around
Just you and I
