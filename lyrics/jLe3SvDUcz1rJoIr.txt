Katie Queen... of Tennessee
I'm on my knees...
unworthy

What shall be
Our destiny
To find true love
A tragedy...

If you see me runnin
Through the streets I'm calling
Into love I'm fallin
Katie be my darling

If you hear the sirens
I hope you find it charmin
I'll be out in the morning
Kt be my darling

If only she
Would notice me
What can I do?
To make her see?

I would swim
The ocean wide, from new Orleans...
to galilea

But Katie Queen of Tennessee
My Katie Queen of Tennessee
Tell me who I have to be
To be the one beside you dear

If you see me runnin
Through the streets I'm calling
Into love I'm fallin
Katie be my darling
