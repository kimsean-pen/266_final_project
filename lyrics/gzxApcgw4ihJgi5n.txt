When rain drops fall
And you feel low
Ah, do you ever think it's useless?
Do you feel like letting go?
Do you ever sit and do you wonder
Will the world ever change?
And just how long will it take
To have it all rearranged?

Tell me why
These things are still the same?
Tell me why
No one can seem to learn from mistakes?

Take my hand
If you don't know where you're goin'
I'll understand
I've lost the way myself
Oh, don't take that old road
Umm, it leads to nowhere
We must return
Before the clock strikes twelve

It's so easy to do nothin'
When you're busy night and day
Take a step in one direction
Ohh, and take a step the other way
So don't quit tryin' when you stumble
Don't give up should you fall
Keep on searchin' for the passway
That'll lead you through the wall

Don't look back
Or you'll be left behind
Don't look back
Or you will never find peace of mind

Take my hand
If you don't know where you're goin'
I'll understand
I've lost the way myself
Oh, don't take that old road
It leads to nowhere
We must return
Before the clock strikes twelve

Take my hand
If you don't know where you're goin'
I'll understand
I've lost the way myself
Don't take that old road
Ohh, it leads to nowhere
We must return
Before the clock strikes
