At the party we got chained at the wrists
Outside there's girls saying
It's not gonna be just only a kiss
Everyone's disguised just a little bit
I had a bad bad time tonight
I had a bad bad time tonight
Bad things happen in the night
Where we built another world
Styles surround you here comes the night time
Where we built another world

Evening time
I made a loud sound and shake some teeth
Saw the lights pale across the street
It's not gonna be just only a kiss
Everyone's disguised just a little bit
I had a bad bad time tonight
I had a bad bad time tonight
Bad things happen in the night
Where we built another world

Styles surround you here comes the night time
Where we built another world
Evening time
Where we built another world
Hang ghosts from the trees and that's what I saw
Where we built another world
Hang ghosts from the trees and that's what I saw
Where we built another world
Where we built another world
Where we built another world
Here comes the night time
