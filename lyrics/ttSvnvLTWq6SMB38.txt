You are only a whisper away
But I can't touch your heart
If the words aren't enough to bet your soul
I'll give you the moon
You are always shining sun or rain
Like a violet stone
I close my eyes but you never fade
But you never disappear

I feel alone
Can't you see me standing on the verge of blue?
I'll be watching all the stars till they are gone
Should I know nothing could make me miss you less?

*Oh I'll be waiting for you to tell me what is love
I don't know how to be loved, how to be by your side
Morning lights shine in my room
I'm holding dreams of you
It may take no less than this pain
But I can't stop loving you

Feel my heart
You have never know that you have all of me
Every time I see you I'm falling in love
I can live or I can't live without you

*Oh I'll be waiting for you to tell me what is love
I don't know how to be loved, how to be by your side
Morning lights shine in my room
I'm holding dreams of you
It may take no less than my life
But I can't stop loving you
