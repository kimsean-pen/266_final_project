Talking bout girls it's naturally empty
Our friends come and go they make the most of me
I want you more and more but you do not know
Our time is running out, I can't seem to let you go

Oh, when you go I'll be around
It makes me bleed and cry when things get down
Oh, when you go I'll be around
It hurts to know that I'll be on the ground

Dark was the sky tingly and cold
Honest is my lie, all my friends are animals
I can't remember when, I don't remember why
I fell inside your web as I looked into your eyes

Oh, when you go I'll be around
It makes me bleed and cry when things get down
Oh, when you go I'll be around
It hurts to know that I'll be on the ground

(We're not alone)
(We're not alone)
(We're not alone)
(We're not alone)

Girl of mine (We're not alone)
Why do you leave me? (We're not alone)
But still I try (We're not alone)
It's hard to be here (We're not alone)
(We're not alone)
(We're not alone)
(We're not alone)

Girl of mine (We're not alone)
Why do you leave me? (We're not alone)
But still I try (We're not alone)
It's hard to be here
