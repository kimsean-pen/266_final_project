I know a girl called Jonny
She's a bullet, she's a villainess
[In my silver dress I'm the disasteress]
Combing out her long straight hair

Jonny bangs the drums ([Jonny bangs the drums])
Jonny bangs the drums ([Jonny bangs the drums])

She's my narcotic lollipop ([I put my fingers in his mouth])
She's my narcotic lollipop ([I put my fingers in his mouth])
She's my narcotic lollipop ([I put my fingers in his mouth])

I know a girl called Jonny
She's an impossibility
[I'm an alchemist in my astronaut's dress]
Changing all the girls into boys

Jonny bangs the drums ([Jonny bangs the drums])
She's my narcotic lollipop ([I put my fingers in his mouth])

[He's a pin-up poster high school crushHe's a full-sugar U.V. glossHe's a new dance, he zips me upHe's changing all the boys into girls]

She's my narcotic lollipop ([I put my fingers in his mouth])

I know a girl called Jonny
Puts the boys in a snow-white feint
[I'm the Joan of Arc of teenage lust]
Pashing with the devil at the bus stop

Jonny bangs the drums ([Jonny bangs the drums])
She's my narcotic lollipop ([I put my fingers in his mouth])
She's my narcotic
