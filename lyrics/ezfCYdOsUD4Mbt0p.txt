Keep words away from
my mouth
Nothing I say now
will help
Cause if all I have to lose
is standing in my way
It's you I'll have to choose
But please don't take it the wrong way
Please don't take it wrong
My heart is changing
Hollow??
My face is ageing???
Cause if all I have to lose
is standing in my way
It's you i'll have to choose
But please don't take it the wrong way
Please don't take it wrong
