I think I fell in love today
He thinks it's too soon to say
But my heart told me so
I don't know exactly how it happened
It kinda felt like magic
I guess when you know, you know

'Cause love don't have any rules
When gravity starts to pull
You closer to another
From a friend to a lover
Looks like forever in his eyes
That don't happen all the time
But when it does, it changes everything
I think I fell in love today

I think I fell in love today
I'm sure he saw it on my face 'cause
I couldn't break my smile, yeah
The stars weren't lined up in a row
There was no firework show
But in that moment, he was mine

'Cause love don't have any rules
When gravity starts to pull
You closer to another
From a friend to a lover
Looks like forever in his eyes
That don't happen all the time
But when it does, it changes everything
And I think I fell in love today, yeah
I think I fell in love today, yeah yeah

Ask me again, a few years down the road
'Cause I guess by then, we'll know

I think I fell in love today
I'm sure I've never felt this way with you
And I think you may just feel the same
So baby won't you say you love me too
