It's not the feeling like when you touch a flame
No it's not like when someone calls you a bad name
It's not like the hurt when you slip and fall down
No it's not like any of these, what I found is

Your love hurts like a paper cut
So sweet
Never even feel, it slices so deep
It seems so harmless but only at first

Like a paper cut the pain grows worse
Oh, oh
It's not so much in the words that you don't say
It's not when you act in a distantly cold way

It's more in your eyes, how you look at me
Like you no longer care for what I see
Your love hurts like a paper cut
So sweet

Never even feel, it slices so deep
It seems so harmless but only at first
Like a paper cut the pain grows worse
You had to go and show me just how good
Your love could be, than you threw it all away

I can't help but feel a brand new pain
So I'm asking baby please stay
Your love hurts like a paper cut
So sweet
Never even feel, it slices so deep
It seems so harmless but only at first
Like a paper cut the pain grows worse
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
(the pain grows worse)
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
(the pain grows worse)
Oh, oh
(the pain grows worse)
