I've been let loose on the town tonight
Out of control, need no more
I'm feeling mean dressed in leather
It's a screamer
City nights, trashing all the sites
When will this night come to end
Washed out, washed out
Washed out, washed out
Washed out, washed out
Alright
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Could never put me back together again
I guess the action wins
How could this all begin?
It is time for just one more line
When will this night come to end
Washed out, washed out
Washed out, washed out
Washed out, washed out
I'm washed
It is time for just one more line
When will this night come to end
Washed out, washed out
Washed out, washed out
Washed out, washed out
I'm washed out
