Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Loving what I'm tasting (ooh)
Venom on my tongue
Dependent at times
Poisonous vibrations (ooh)
Help my body run
I'm running for my li-i-i-i-i-ife
Running for my li-i-i-i-i-ife

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Fall out of formation (ooh)
I plan my escape
From walls they confined
Rebel red carnation (ooh)
Grows while I decay
I'm running for my li-i-i-i-i-ife
Running for my li-i-i-i-i-ife
Yeah, I'm running for my li-i-i-i-i-ife
Running for my li-i-i-i-i-ife

Hide you in my coat pocket
Where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible
You wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead
My body lives on lead
The last two lines may read
Incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a paper maker
I despise you sometimes
I love to hate the fight
And you in my life is like...

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah
