Well I take a notebook
I walk away
This paper which I took makes me say
Papapapapaa

Will I have to try again
Say Papapapapaaa
For you to understand?

I should have known you better,
I should have hugged you more
Before I write you that letter
I should have done what
I've been looking for
Papapapapapaa

Will I have to try again
Papapapaa
for you to understand?

Am I that weird?
Am I that strange?
I've got one fear
It is so hard to change
So papapapapaaa

Will I have to try again
Papapapapapaapa
For you to understand

Am I that weird
Am I that strange
I've got one fear,
which is so hard to change

Papapapa
Will I have to try again
Papapapaaapapaa
For you to understand
Paraparapapa
Pararapapapapararara

I should have known you better,
I should have hugged you more
Before I write you that letter
I should have done what
I've been looking for

Papapapapaa
Will I have to try again
Papapapaaapapaa
For you to understand

But I am weird
And I feel strange
I've got one fear, it is so hard to change
