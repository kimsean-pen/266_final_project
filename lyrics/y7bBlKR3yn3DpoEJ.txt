The sound of your footsteps
Telling me that you're near
Your soft gentle motion, babe
It brings out a need in me that nobody hears, except

In my midnight confession
When I tell all the world that I love you
In my midnight confession
When I say all the things that I want to
I love you

But a little gold ring you wear on your hand makes me understand
There's another before me, you'll never be mine
I'm wasting my time

Staggering through the daytime
Your image on my mind
Passing so close beside you babe
Sometimes the feelings are so hard to hide, but

In my midnight confession
When I tell all the world that I love you
In my midnight confession
When I say all the things that I want to
I love you

There's a little gold ring you wear on your hand makes me understand
There's another before me, you'll never be mine
I'm wasting my time

In my midnight confession
When I'm telling the world that I love you
In my midnight confession
When I say all the things that I want to...
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la, la la...
