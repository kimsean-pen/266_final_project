Too much sorrow on the oceans
Too much fighting on the streets
Too much roorback in the headlines
Too much hate and evil deeds
Did you think you'd get off easy
Did you think we would connive
All those dark manipulations
You accomplished in your life

Time to take responsibilty
For the games that you misplay
You belief in immortality
And we believe in judgment day

Welcome to hell this is the end
The flame of relief
Welcome to hell this is the end
Don't succumb to grief
Go on lie and go on blow your horn
Who sows the wind shall reap the storm

Too much cheating and corruption
Degradation and deceit
Too much guile too many victims
No concerns for those in need
Did you think that you could slip through
Did you think that we would blench
We are weak but we are many and we're seeking for revenge

Time to take responsibilty
For the games that you misplay
You belief in immortality
And we believe in judgment day

Welcome to hell this is the end
The flame of relief
Welcome to hell this is the end
Don't succumb to grief
Go on lie and go on blow your horn
Who sows the wind shall reap the storm

Welcome to hell this is the end
The flame of relief
Welcome to hell this is the end
Don't succumb to grief
Go on lie and go on blow your horn
Who sows the wind shall reap the storm

Welcome to hell this is the end
The flame of relief
Welcome to hell this is the end
Don't succumb to grief
Go on lie and go on blow your horn
Who sows the wind shall reap the storm
