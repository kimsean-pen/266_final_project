I know what I know
I know on the car ride down
I hear it in my head real low
Turn into the only thing I ever

Turn into hope I do
Turn into you

I know what I know
Well I know that girl you found
Keep that kind of window closed
She'll turn into the only thing that ever

Turn into hope I do
Turn into you

Can't say why I kept this from you
My those quiet eyes become you
Leave it where it can't remind us
Turn this all around behind us, oh
Well I know
Well I'll fall right in to keep you out
I'd like to tell you all about it

I know what I know
I know it's the last time round
I'll hear it in my head real low
Turn into the only thing that ever knows
Only thing that ever knows

I know what I know
I know, ah yes
