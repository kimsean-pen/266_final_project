We saw the western coast, I saw the hospital
Nurse the shoreline like a wound
Reports of lovers tryst were neither clear nor discript
We kept it safe and slow, the quiet things that no one ever knows

So keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day it gets tired, today's the day we dropped out
Gave up my body and bed, all for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals

So keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day it gets tired, today's the day we dropped out
Gave up my body and bed, all for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals

I contemplate the day we wed, your friends are boring me to death
Your veil is ruined in the rain, by then I knew I could do without
There's nothing new to talk about and though our kids are blessed
Their parents let them shoulder all the blame

So keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day it gets tired, today's the day we dropped out
Gave up my body and bed, all for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals

So keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day it gets tired, today's the day we dropped out
Gave up my body and bed, all for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals

I lie for only you
And I lie, well Hallelu
I lie for only you
And I lie, well Hallelu

So keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day it gets tired, today's the day we dropped out
Gave up my body and bed, all for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals

So keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day it gets tired, today's the day we dropped out
Gave up my body and bed, all for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals
