As soon as my eyes shut the slide show begins
Yesterday is gone now and panic sets in
With a weight upon my chest and a ghost upon my back
And the numbing sensation of everything I lack that leaves me

Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, ooh
Your real world away

And beautiful, beautiful bright eyes lie
Only beautiful, oh, beautiful bright eyes cry
Singing late morning lullaby

The first sign of morning is gray and alarming
It's so disappointing, the day has come so soon
While the rest of the world greets the day and feels new
I will push it away just like I always do, I will be

Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, ooh
Your real world away

And beautiful, oh, beautiful bright eyes lie
Only beautiful, oh, beautiful bright eyes cry
Singing late morning lullaby, late morning lullaby

Oh, I would darken my window so I can fall asleep
While the critics frown down on the hours, I keep that leave me

Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, ooh
Your real world away
