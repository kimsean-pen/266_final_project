We all make mistakes
Nobody's perfect
See, that's why you're worth it
As long as you learn it
We all need a break
Baby don't wait for me
You know I'll be there in the morning
Oh yea, in the morning

Well ask me if I said it, yea I said it all
Well ask me if I done it, yea I done it all
So hate me (hate me)
For living in the moment (moment)

Well ask me if I smoked it, yea I smoked it all
Well ask me if I drank it, yea I drank it all for me
Ain't afraid to own it

We all make mistakes
Nobody's perfect
See, that's why you're worth it
As long as you learn it
We all need a break
Baby don't wait for me
You know I'll be there in the morning
Oh yea, in the morning

Baby in the morning we'll forget it all
You know the sun gonna rise and the light will be shining on you
Cause everybody's gonna try to bring you down
Baby when you're holding on to something they can't take away from you
So just keep holding on, yea

[?] ... stars
Set us free to become who we are
Don't want to live in a world that pulls itself apart
You know the love will rain, hit the breaks because

We all make mistakes
Nobody's perfect
See, that's why you're worth it
As long as you learn it
We all need a break
Baby don't wait for me
You know I'll be there in the morning
Oh yea, in the morning
