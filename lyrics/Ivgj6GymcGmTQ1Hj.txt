The war you fight is underneath
the water, getting deeper.
The wall, the wall, the falling wall,
the wall is busting open.
The wall is busting open.

In like a dull knife
pulls out all the stops
I fall out like
time running out

(even when I was whispering
you hold on, the water was slippery
you listen, the weather was answering
I let go, I wanna get into it)

You've got your reasons that, hey hey,
turned by the seasons and long days gone
too many minds in my, I don't know,
got in the way of my busting out

Cold and under, I almost forgot to
face up to what i ought to.
Willing and I do give offering to you
Willing and I do give offering to you
Don't know why I feel so different
Feel just like a different person
Willing and I do give offering to you

You're tied in a knot, can't throw you back here.
You've got the floor, they say. You gotta lock it up.
Late into the night you wore off that fever.
That fever.

You've got your reasons that, hey hey,
turned by the seasons and long days gone.
Too many minds in my, I don't know
got in the way of my busting out.

I'm over here by your way.
Tight as a knot, i want to fade.
I'm over here by your way.
Tight as a knot, I want to fade
