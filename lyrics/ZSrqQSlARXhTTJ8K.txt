You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love

You never take advice
Someday you'll pay the price, I know

I've seen it before, it happens all the time
You're closing the door, you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold, you're throwing away
A fortune in feelings, but someday you'll pay

You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love

You want paradise
But someday you'll pay the price, I know

I've seen it before, it happens all the time
You're closing the door, you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold, you're throwing away
A fortune in feelings, but someday you'll pay

(Cold as ice) You know that you are
(Cold cold as as ice) As cold as ice to me
(Cold cold cold as as as ice)

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(You're as cold as ice)
(You're as cold as ice)

You're as cold as ice
Cold as ice, I know (You're as cold as ice)
Yes I know

(You're as cold as ice) You're as cold as ice
Cold as ice, I know (You're as cold as ice)
Oh yes I know

(You're as cold as ice) You're as cold as ice
Cold as ice, I know (You're as cold as ice)
Oh yes I know

(You're as cold as ice) You're as cold as ice
You're as cold as ice
