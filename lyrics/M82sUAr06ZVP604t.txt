For our saviour could not deny
All born the same
All born the same
You won't hear the truth

I can feel it, close your eyes
I still see...
You invent the proof
I can feel it, close your eyes
I still see...
You won't hear the truth

Born a failure
Could not deny
All born the same
All born the same
You won't hear the truth

I can feel it, close your eyes
I still see...
You invent the proof
I can feel it, close your eyes
I still see...
You won't hear the truth

For our saviour could not deny
You won't hear the truth

I can feel it, close your eyes
I still see...
You invent the proof
I can feel it, close your eyes
I still see...
You won't hear the truth
