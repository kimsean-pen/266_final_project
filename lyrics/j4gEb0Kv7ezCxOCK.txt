Step on it like a taxi driver
Not gonna tell you which way to go
I'll just give my destination
Only cause you can take it slow

I'm way ahead of you
Way ahead, way ahead
So keep your eyes on the road
If I catch ya, if I catch ya
If I catch you in the rearview mirror
Don't let ya, don't let ya
Don't let your mind unfold

Kill the map and left me to run
Kill the map and left me to run
Get lost and ride it to the sun
Let you know when we're done
Get me outta here right now
Do find a way, don't care how
Get lost and ride it to the sun
To the heartbreak horizon

Just when I feel the wind whip in my hair
You can work it out how fast to go
Use some real life communication
Lucky I know what words don't show

I'm way ahead of you
Way ahead, way ahead
So keep your eyes on the road
If I catch ya, if I catch ya
If I catch you in the rearview mirror
Don't let ya, don't let ya
Don't let your mind unfold

Kill the map and left me to run
Kill the map and left me to run
Get lost and ride it to the sun
Let you know when we're done
Get me outta here right now
Do find a way, don't care how
Get lost and ride it to the sun
To the heartbreak horizon
Kill the map and left me to run
Kill the map and left me to run
Get lost and ride it to the sun
Let you know when we're done
Get me outta here right now
Do find a way, don't care how
Get lost and ride it to the sun
To the heartbreak horizon

Pain falls away 'til I
Can't find a way after
Heartbreak horizon
Take me there
Don't put the breaks on me
You know the way to the
Heartbreak horizon
Heartbreak horizon

Kill the map and left me to run
Kill the map and left me to run
Get lost and ride it to the sun
Let you know when we're done
Get me outta here right now
Do find a way, don't care how
Get lost and ride it to the sun
To the heartbreak horizon
Kill the map and left me to run
Kill the map and left to run
Get lost and ride it to the sun
Let you know when we're done
Get me outta here right now
Do find a way, don't care how
Get lost and ride it to the sun
To the heartbreak horizon
