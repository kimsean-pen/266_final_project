You suffocated me
When I try to breath
You all leave in me
Let the light
You got to think it out
But I'm chill about now
And I don't wanna go back
I don't wanna go back
All I want in life is to skip in the end
Nothing left to care about
As long as he pretend
Just skip to the end
When I hear you say
ain't not that bad
I got a [?] when I was sad
Hey would you really try to save your breath
I giving you a breath to get out of my head
Keep your charity
Cause I don't need you to contact me
So go find another [?]
Cause I don't want you here
I don't want you here
When this day is probably done
Tomorrow it's probably denided
All I want in this life is to skip to the end
Nothing left to care about
As long as he pretend
Just skip to the end
Say what you feel
It isn't real
You want indeed
Say what you feel
Who wanna be
When this day is probably done
Tomorrow it's probably denided
All I want in this life is to skip to the end
Nothing left to care about
As long as he pretend
Just skip to the end
All I want in this life is to skip to the end
Nothing left to care about
As long as he pretend
Just skip to the end
Just skip to the end
Just skip to the end
