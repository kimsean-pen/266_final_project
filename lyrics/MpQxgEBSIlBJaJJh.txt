A misty path through woods long past
enshrined in silence and runes will keep
the secrets of Dol Guldur

Far away and over the cold fog mountains
our gleaming eyes are searching for a sign
and down to the deepest dungeons
and to the old forgotten lair

We must leave now, before a new day breaks
to search for the pale gold
that once belonged to the forest

By the sounds of pounding hammers
that sound like bells of the elves
in our ears...
we are still searching in the underground
where our dark secrets sleep

Far away over the cold fog mountains
we have to leave now, before a new day breaks
eternally...
