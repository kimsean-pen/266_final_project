Stand down
Manifesting a destiny
of unavoidable doom
Black wolves are gnashing at our heels
Fangs of accountability
all unforeseen or intentionally neglected?
The degradation of a home
Humanity sits on its throne
Cover your eyes and ears and know
we can't escape the consequence
And now the rising of septic tides as refuse litters the Pacific Gyre
We continue to drown the ocean in its own waters
Stand down, Stand down
Time's out now
Kill like we know how
Killing like we're allowed!
The degradation of a home
Humanity is so lost
Cover your eyes and ears and know (without remorse)
we can't escape the consequence
And everything's ending.
Make way
A failed culture makes its mark existing only to destroy what came first
With no regard for creation, men play God, drop unstoppable bombs
All institutions are wrong, but none of them will ever stop!
Make way for man, Make way for man, Make way for man, Make way for man
Bombs away, Bombs away, Bombs Away
NO ESCAPE!
Now turn the other cheek and pretend
Full speed to hatred forcing life against its will
Full speed 'til we're dead, We can't escape the consequence
we can't escape the consequence
Bombs Away
The degradation of a home
Bombs Away
Humanity sits on its throne
Bombs Away
Cover your eyes and ears and know
Bombs Away
we can't escape the consequence.
NO ESCAPE
