They want all for one and none for all.
I want to be there to witness the downfall.
They'll only sell us out once our backs are turned, and we'll keep paying the price until our lesson is learnt.
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin.
Every snake has its price.
If the money's on the table they don't think twice.
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin.
We are paralysed.
But there are none so blind as those who will not see.
What's it going to take to get us to stand up?
‘Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don't give a fuck
about what matters to us.
Another faceless figure, an empty silhouette.
They'll line their pockets and leave us six feet deep in debt.
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin.
Always out for blood, praying on the weak.
We can count on them to paint the future bleak, but still we're standing by whilst they bleed us dry.
We are paralysed.
But there are none so blind as those who will not see.
What's it going to take to get us to stand up?
‘Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don't give a fuck
about what matters to us.
So enough is enough.
‘Right' and wrong it's all the same to me.
Thick as thieves as far as I can see.
They are leeches all,
but still we're standing by whilst they bleed us dry.
They want all for one and none for all.
I want to be there to witness the downfall.
