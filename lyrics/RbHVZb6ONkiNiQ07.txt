You are just poison
I'll put that on my grave
No need for aggression
I just need to behaved

But your love is poison
I'll put that on my soul
Pull me down with seduction
I know that you want control

You are my drugs, you are what i need, the love of my life
You kiss me i bleed
And right when I fiend
I'm grinding my teeth
I get high when you speak
If i could jump i could fly
Is so cold in the clouds
But i stay in the sky and i see you on the ground
I guess it wasn't the same
You know i smoke and you drank
We ain't one in the same
I can't remember you name
Bot i remember your scent
And i remember the...
And i remember the days
We wasn't stuck in our ways
Not a subject for change
I'm just a rat in your maze
And your venom's to blame

You are just poison
I'll put that on my grave
No need for aggression
I just need to behaved

But your love is poison
I'll put that on my soul
Pull me down with seduction
I know that you want control

Poison
Poison
Poison
Poison
