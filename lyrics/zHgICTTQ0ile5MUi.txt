I can taste more than feel
This burning inside is so real
I can almost lay my hands upon
The warm glow that lingers on

Moved
Lifted higher
Moved
My soul's on fire
Moved
By a higher love

I surrender all control
To the desire that consumes me whole
Leads me by the hand to infinity
Lies in wait at the heart of me

Moved
Lifted higher
Moved
My soul's on fire
Moved
By a higher love
By a higher love

Heaven bound on the wings of love
There's so much that you can rise above

Moved
Lifted higher
Moved
Moved
By a higher love
By a higher love

I surrender heart and soul
Sacrificed to a higher goal

Moved
Moved
By a higher love
By a higher love
By a higher love
By a higher love
