I hear the footsteps going by,
Watching myself slowly die,
Sharp pains impaling through my heart,
Slowly tearing me apart...

One minute you're an angel fallen from grace.
Next, the fix that I hate.
Pick me up from the gutter with a gentle kiss,
Then rips out my heart to show me, how black it is!

No...
You're no good...
it feels so cold...
Yet I won't turn back.
I'll die alone.

I hear the footsteps walking by.
Watching myself slowly die.
Sharp pains impaling through my heart,
Slowly tearing me apart...

When you appear as an angel,
Knocking me down, looking my way.
Could you ever kill the pain in my heart?
Even though they say angels don't kill.

F**k no...
You're no good...
it feels so cold...
Yet I won't turn back.
I'll die alone.
No...
You're no good...
it feels so cold...
Yet I won't turn back.
I'll die alone.
