We come to grips with our wrists
We come to sound with our mouth
We sing of what we think we know
Mother, father, skin and flaws
And we move just like the birds
Moving amidst the other birds
And we move just like the fish
Rolling away from larger

And I know I'm protect the light of lichen
But, oh you look like a morning star
To see who we are
And I know you're protecting the light of lichen
But oh you look like a morning star
Just see who we are

You look good in the west
See how you clap those hands
You look good in the south
See how you use your mouth
You look good in the east
All elbows and knees
To the honey dipper
To the soul shifter

Oh, don't you know you want to
See that moonrise in the rear view
Just like you had wanted it to
Temperature drops
The hot tar it cools
Radio, oh the radio, calling to you
Right out loud she said it
Right out loud they meant it
Sing that song like I know you can
Work your jaw like a blind man
Call like call like you own the land
Throw up your hands
Make demands

You look good in the west
See how you clap those hands
You look good in the south
See how you use your mouth
You look good in the east
All elbows and knees
To the honey dipper
To the soul shifter

You look good in the north
Whip your hair back and forth
You look good in the east
Don't hold the wall, move your feet
You look good in the south
Make your makers proud
You look good in the west
You look good in a dress

I feel, I feel
I feel like a morning star
I feel, I feel
I feel like a morning star
I feel, I feel
I feel like a morning star
I feel, I feel

Sound with our mouth
We call it grips with our
We call it grips our wrists
We call it sounds with our mouths
We call it grips with our ahh, ahhh
