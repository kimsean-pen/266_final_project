Jane said she had a problem with
The modern world
All the boys she ever loved are
With another girl
And her father always wanna
Bring her way down low and
All the doctors that she ever met have
Gotta way to go

Jane said she had a problem with
Her mother's wealth
Said she ought to cut and run
And grow up by herself
So, she wrote a letter to them on
The way to school
The way to school now

Said she cannot live her life
Under her father's rule

Don't call the morning after
Won't stop the pain and laughter
Won't fix the failing plan
You gotta pay the man
You gotta give it all away
And you have gotta go

Janey said she had a problem with
Her failing health
Said she's gonna fix it all up on
The National Health

She only got a couple of worries
Gotten out of hand and
When she tells her doctors that
They never understand

Don't call the morning after
Won't stop the pain and laughter
Won't help to pass the blame
You gotta take the pain
You gotta give it all away
And you have gotta go

Janey had a revelation on
The way to school
Said she's gonna hang herself
Up the bathing pool
She's really gonna lay it on them
'Cause she always knew that

Every mother wants to die before
Her children do

Don't call the morning after
Won't stop the big disaster
Don't miss the main event
You gotta pay the rent
You gotta give it all away
And you have gotta go
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon we're living
In the modern world
