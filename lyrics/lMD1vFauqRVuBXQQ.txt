I'm sorry I'm not what you wanted
A blissful expectation of something you never got
And I'm sorry we're not were we started
You've wasted all your time in holding on

The fights that I started, looking up reasons to argue
We're not clear and I hate seeing you
I'm bored of being sober and we're only getting older
I wish that you could feel me like you used to

There's a crack in the ceiling where the light bleeds in here
I feel you all around me, but I can't cave in
I want to say I need you, but I need nothing
I need nothing, I need nothing
There's a crack up in the ceiling where the light bleeds in
And I feel you all around me, but I can't cave in
And I want to say I need you, but I need nothing
I need nothing, I need nothing

Need nothing, need nothing
Need nothing, need nothing

Oh, I'm sorry I'm so condescending
Tired of my show, just keep me standing
If you'd hold it against me
I'm sorry I'm so disconnected
Didn't see you as you came and left
Please don't hold it against me

The fights that I started, looking up reasons to argue
We're not clear and I hate seeing you
I'm bored of being sober and we're only getting older
I wish that you could feel me like you used to

There's a crack in the ceiling where the light bleeds in here
I feel you all around me, but I can't cave in
I want to say I need you, but I need nothing
I need nothing, I need nothing
There's a crack up in the ceiling where the light bleeds in
And I feel you all around me, but I can't cave in
And I want to say I need you, but I need nothing
I need nothing, I need nothing

Need nothing, need nothing
Need nothing, need nothing
Need nothing, need nothing
Need nothing, need nothing

Need nothing, need nothing
Need nothing, need nothing
Need nothing, need nothing
Need nothing, need nothing

There's a crack in the ceiling where the light bleeds in here
I feel you all around me, but I can't cave in
I want to say I need you, but I need nothing
I need nothing, I need nothing
