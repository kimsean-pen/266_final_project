Riding up the alley in the rain
No lights to show the way
How could this ever be their home
Through the darkness you could only see
A giant shadow which was to be
A house where evil ruled at night

And the shadows at the gate
They seemed to be alive
Yeah the shadows at the gate
Alive!

Everything inside was left untouched
Except for what the rats had got
And the dust of time that showed it's mark
Armed with candlelight and open eyes
Through the dark they fought their way
'til every room was lit again

And the house began to breathe
It seemed to be alive
Yeah, the house began to breathe
Alive!

As the candlelight began to fade
And Jonathan said "let's go to bed"
The fireplace had ceased to burn
Both were fast asleep before the dawn
Dreaming, dreaming
And they did not know about the shadow

Yeah the shadow on the wall
It really came alive
Yeah the shadow on the wall
Sunrise!
