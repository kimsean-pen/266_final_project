Michelle Williams
The Greatest

Thought I was standing tall
I thought I'd seen it all
But baby I was wrong
Cause you're the greatest
I walked a thousand miles
But nothing's what I found
Until you came around
Cause you're the greatest

Searched high and low for love just
To find out, that it was here all
Along and, I know it, what I wanted it
I should have been chasing you

And I was reaching for the stars
But I didn't have to look so far
Cause love is where you are
But I didn't have a clue
And now I realize
That the stars are in your eyes
Cause you always shine
Baby you're the greatest

Thought everything had change
Until the day you came
And took away the pain
Baby you're the greatest
I always wore a frown
I never used to smile
Until the showed me how
Baby you're the greatest

Searched high and low for love just
To find out, that it was here all
Along and, I know it, what I wanted it
I should have been chasing you

And I was reaching for the stars (reaching for the stars)
But I didn't have to look so far
Cause love is where you are
But I didn't have a clue
And now I realize
That the stars are in your eyes
Cause you always shine
Baby you're the greatest

Reaching for the stars and I then I bumped into you
And I can not believe that I was searching so long
Ohh baby, I'm so taken
And all that I need is look into your eyes

And I was reaching for the stars
But I didn't have to look so far
Cause love is where you are
But I didn't have a clue
And now I realize
That the stars are in your eyes
Cause you always shine
Baby you're the greatest
