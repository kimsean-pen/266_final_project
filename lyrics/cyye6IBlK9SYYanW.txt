With the news there's something every day
So many people thinking different ways, you say
Where is the music?
A tune to free the soul
A simple lyric, to unite us all, you know

Your opinion only knows the one thing
that you seem to want to have most, and you chose
To save yourself in your own time
you'll have to stay open up your own, mind

And every glow in the twilight knows
That the world is only what the world is made of
Just you and me can agree to disagree
And the world is only what the world is made of

In all the noise facing every day
The colored world has turned into grey, you say
And from the void, the place in which we came
Can we step back and see we want the same

Your opinion only knows the one thing
that you seem to want to have most, and you chose
To save yourself in your own time
you'll have to stay open up your own, mind

And every glow in the twilight knows
That the world is only what the world is made of
Just you and me can agree to disagree
And the world is only what the world is made of

(And every glow in the twilight knows)
(That the world is only what the world is made of)
(Just you and me can agree to disagree)
(And the world is only what the world is made of)

(And every glow in the twilight knows)
(That the world is only what the world is made of)
(Just you and me can agree to disagree)
(And the world is only what the world is made of)

(And every glow in the twilight knows)
(That the world is only what the world is made of)
(Just you and me can agree to disagree)
(And the world is only what the world is made of)
