And the fishermen came back across the water
And the people started running in the park
And the city stopped as I held you in my arms

We could hear the sounds of sirens all around us
And the scent of burning oil was in the air
And the music played and it felt so good to hear

This is the life we've been given
So open your mind and start livin'
We can play our part if we only start believing
Yeah

There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking
As the tears from every cloud begins to fall
For one moment then we understood it all

Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming?
And everyone, everyone, every man and every woman
We all fall in the end, we're just miracles of matter
So come on let me love you

This is the life we've been given
So open your mind and start livin'
We can play our part if we only start believing, oh

Yeah, this is the life we've been given
So open your heart and start lovin'
We can make a start if we only learn to listen, yeah

Then the crowd began to head for the horizon
A million people walking back to work
But you and me, we just laid down in the garden
Yeah, you and me, we just laid down in the garden

'Cause this is the life we've been given
So open your mind and start livin'
We can play our part if we only start believing, oh

Yeah, this is the life we've been given
So open your heart and start lovin'
We can make a start if we only learn to listen, yeah

Ooh, ohh, yeah, you and me
We just laid down in the garden
Yeah, the garden
