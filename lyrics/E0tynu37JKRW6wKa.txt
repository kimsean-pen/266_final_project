Never wanna go out
You used to scream and shout
Never wanna go out
Cept for now
You didn't wanna go out
Just to see it passing
You used to never go out, at all

I've got everything I need right here in between
These four walls, everything so clear
No windows in my room, no sun comes in these limitations, are blinding me
Deep inside the center of the city evil lurks, evil lurks
Wash away with holy rain evil looks, evil looks
