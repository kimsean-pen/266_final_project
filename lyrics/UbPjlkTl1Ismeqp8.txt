You can always bring me down but I come around
Like a boomerang like a boomerang round

One time did it two times
And now three times you call me baby
Why don't you let it all out you'll only drive me crazy
Let it go, I said No No No.
I said NO NO NO

I am sarcastic can you cope with my rejection
One time did it two times
And now you reach your own reflection
Turn around
Our go DOWN DOWN DOWN

Why can't you leave me because I am saying that I had it all
It's like you cannot see It's just what I wanted
I can not take it
That you're thinking that you can know it all
Never going down like a boomerang round

You can always bring me down but I come around
Like a boomerang like a boomerang round
You can always bring me down but I come around

Like a boomerang like a boomerang round
I try to face it as you're staging a defiance
I will re-route to remain you know that you are driving me insane

I said no no no let it go
I'm on the edge
It's like I'm caged
I'm mass destruction
Eye for an eye
I see you know you face your deconstruction

Turn around you go DOWN DOWN DOWN
Why can't you leave me cause
I'm saying that I had it all

It's like you cannot see it's just what I wanted
I can not take it
That you're thinking that you can know it all

Never going down like a boomerang round
You can always bring me down but I come around
Like a boomerang like a boomerang round
You can always bring me down but I come around
Like a boomerang like a boomerang round
Think you're bloodbound
Then I am your mastermind
Think you're skybound you are going down down
If you're underground then I am a king crowned
Now you're going down like a boomerang round
Why can't you leave me cause
I'm saying that I had it all
It's like you cannot see it's just what I wanted
I can not take it
That you're thinking that you can know it all
Never going down like a boomerang round
You can always bring me down but I come around
Like a boomerang like a boomerang round
You can always bring me down but I come around
Like a boomerang like a boomerang round
