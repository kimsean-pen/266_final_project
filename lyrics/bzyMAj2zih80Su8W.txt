I didn't think that we'd get so far
I never thought that you had it in you
Now we both got our battle scars
Now we both got our new point of views

And now I see you've become
A bitter heart with no one
To come home to
(Sorry, I'm not sorry
No, no)

We were young and stupid
We thought that we might get through it
Now you want an apology
Now you want an apology
It took two to make it
It took one of us to break it
Now you want an apology
Now you want an apology

Not sorry, not sorry
Not sorry, no, no
Not sorry, not sorry
Not sorry, no, no

I didn't think that you'd hurt so bad
I recall that you didn't need me
I never thought that you'd get so mad
Call me selfish and call me crazy
And now you see I've become
A bigger heart with the one I hold on to

Sorry, I'm not sorry
No, no

We were young and stupid
We thought that we might get through it
Now you want an apology
Now you want an apology
It took two to make it
It took one of us to break it
Now you want an apology
Now you want an apology

Not sorry, not sorry
Not sorry, no, no
Not sorry, not sorry
Not sorry, no, no

Now that I see you've become
A bitter heart with no one
To hold on to
No one besides yourself
How could you say it's my fault?

We were young and stupid
We thought that we might get through it
Now you want an apology
Now you want an apology
It took two to make it
It took one of us to break it
Now you want an apology
Now you want an apology
Now you want an apology

Not sorry, not sorry
Not sorry, no, no
Not sorry, not sorry
Not sorry, no, no

Not sorry, not sorry
Not sorry
Now you want an apology
Now you want an apology

Not sorry, not sorry
Not sorry, no, no

Not sorry
