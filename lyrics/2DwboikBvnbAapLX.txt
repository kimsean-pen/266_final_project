Dirty, dirty fingernails
Dirty, dirty fingernails

Out of the shower,
Onto the bathroom floor
Outta the kitchen-
Underneath the casserole

Dirty, dirty fingernails
Dirty, dirty fingernails

Out of the shower,
Onto the bathroom floor
Outta the kitchen,
Underneath the casserole-
Dirty, dirty fingernails

Dirty, dirty fingernails
Dirty... fing-ernails

Dirty, dirty fingernails
{Talkin dirty to the wall}
Out of the shower,
Onto the bathroom floor
{Takin' a lot of energy to make that sound}
Outta the kitchen,
underneath the casserole
{Takin' a lot of energy to make that sound}

Dirty, dirty fingernails
Dirty, dirty fingernails
Dirty, dirty fingernails
Dirty, dirty fingernails

Outta the shower,
onto the bathroom floor.
Out in the kitchen,
underneath the casserole
Out on the patio-
Out in the great outdoors...

Dirty, dirty fingernails
Dir-ty fingernails.
{Dirty, dirty fingernails}

I woke up in my own...
I woke up...
