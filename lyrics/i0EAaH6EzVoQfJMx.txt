Hey!

Don't touch kid, sleep with the lights on
Touch kid, how you surprise me
Now roll kid, knock your body off!

You're something like a phenomena
Something like an astronomer
Roll kid, knock your body off!

Something like a phenomena, baby
Something like a phenomena
Something like a phenomena, babe
Gonna get your body off

Don't fall asleep with the motor running
She'll make you sweat in the water
Don't fall asleep with the motor running
She'll make you sweat in the water

Hot time kid
Hot time kid
It's cold under the blanket
They loved it
Then shot it
The fastest went and got it
That stole it with ease ma
They hide it up the sleeves, ma
They hide it
They hide it
They're never gonna find it

Don't fall asleep with the motor running
She'll make you sweat in the water
Don't fall asleep with the motor running
She'll make you sweat in the water

Something like a phenomena, baby
Something like a phenomena
Something like a phenomena, baby
Gonna get your body off
Something like a phenomena, baby
Something like a phenomena
Something like a phenomena, baby
Gonna get your body off

Hot time kid
Hot time kid
It's cold under the blanket
Hot time kid
Hot time kid
It's cold under the blanket
