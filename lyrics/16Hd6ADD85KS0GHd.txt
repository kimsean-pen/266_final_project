Johnny Cool was the king, he was the leader of the boot boys
He'd never cause no trouble, in a rumble make some noise
He heard about some chick and they way she liked to rock
He said, "Come here honey, let me see you lift up your frock"

Gonna be a little showdown
Showdown there
Gonna be a little showdown
Showdown there

Miss Lucy was a chick and he knew she like to ball
He said, "Come on Lucy, it don't matter to me at all"
But Miss Lucy got a fella with a flick knife in his hand
Johnny Cool pull a shotgun, the man is in command

Gonna be a little showdown
Showdown there
Gonna be a little showdown
Showdown there

Gonna be a little showdown
Showdown there
Gonna be a little showdown
Showdown there

King Cool, King Kong, King King
With all the kings

King of hearts he's a lover and he give her everything
King of spades, he's a brother doin' his own thing
King of clubs makes a dollar
King of diamonds is a wedding ring

Gonna be a little showdown
Showdown there
Gonna be a little showdown
Showdown there

Gonna be a little showdown
Showdown there

Showdown, showdown there
Showdown, showdown there
Showdown, showdown there (Gonna be, got to be, gonna be, got to be, showdown)
Showdown, showdown there
