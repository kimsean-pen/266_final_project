I close my eyes and travel somewhere far away
You're still the one thing on my mind

I'm falling through a new dimension every day
You're still the one thing on my mind

I reimagine you in each and every way
I guess I'll find my peace in time

It doesn't matter really what you had to say
You're still the one thing on my mind

Oh, it's coming up on me slowly
Really fighting it off tonight
Oh, it came so swift but surely
You're just always on my mind

I close my eyes and try to make it go away
You're still the one thing on my mind
