Nails

I got nails on my back
Scratched up
Like a cat attack
Throat grab
Now she throw a jab
Layin all blind and gagged

Life is a bitch tryna fuck (tryna fuck)
But I don't wanna fuck
Rather she suck on my dick and throw up

Bitch you didn't give a fuck
Who I was (Who I was)
Till I got a bit of buzz but I'm still not really shit

Fuck up anything that get up in the way of
being a level 11 mage and I really wanna thank
Crowley and light

Why try?
Do or die
I pretend I'm doing fine
Really I want to get high
But I refrain cuz it never did help me
Show a sign
That I'm meant to be alive
Lookin' I can't find the light (Can't find the light)

I don't give a motherfuck about a bitch
Every bitch only want one thing from me
Back up
Let me be alone
Let me self-loath
Vulnerable soul with nowhere to go
Nail me to the cross and watch me bleed out
I'm sick of living like I'm already dead

I got nails on my back
Scratched up
Like a cat attack
Throat grab
Now she throw a jab
Layin' all blind and gagged

Life is a bitch tryna fuck (tryna fuck)
But I don't wanna fuck
Rather she suck on my dick and throw up

I got nails on my back
Scratched up
Like a cat attack
Throat grab
Now she throw a jab
Layin' all blind and gagged

Life is a bitch tryna fuck (tryna fuck)
But I don't wanna fuck
Rather she suck on my dick and throw up

I got nails on my back
Hammering into me when will it end
