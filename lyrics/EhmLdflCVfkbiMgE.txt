Say you're hurting
But that's not where you're at
But then again who am
I to say a word about that?
Come again?
Did you wanna ask something?
Amen, I'm ready for judging
Forget I even said anything
Better yet turn around and start walking
So I sleep on it until next morning
Recurring dream so far from close
This nightmare is not my first warning
So on and on it goes

Relapse once again
Drain out my peace of mind
Too blind to witness
The nature of my crime

I remember sitting through this strife
I didn't just meet you
I've known you my whole life
You tell me to grab a knife or a bottle
Watch your life travel by at full throttle
I'm done rackin' out my fried brain
Just go away, you're nothing new
You're all the same

You knew my story
Turn a page and read the signs
They speak of relapse
Between selected lines

Relapse once again
Drain out my peace of mind
Too blind to witness
The nature of my crime

Relapse once again
Drain out my peace of mind
Too blind to witness
The nature of my crime

The thought of turning back
Sends shivers down my spine
Your delusions sure as
Hell were never mine
You knew my story from
The get-go, read the signs
They scream of relapse
Between selected lines
