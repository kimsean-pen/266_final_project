Here am I
Yet another goodbye!
He says Adiós, says Adiós

And do you know why
She won't break down and cry?
She says Adiós, says Adiós, Goodbye.

One by one my leaves fall.
One by one my tales are told.

It's no lie
She is yearning to fly.
She says Adiós, says Adiós

And now you know why
He's a reason to sigh
She says Adiós, says Adiós, Goodbye.

One by one my leaves fall.
One by one my tales are told.

My, oh my!
She was aiming too high.
He says Adiós, says Adiós

And now you know why
There's no moon in her sky
He says Adiós, says Adiós, Goodbye.

He says Adiós, says Adiós, Goodbye.

No Goodbyes
For love brightens their eyes.
Don't say Adiós, say Adiós

And do you know why
There's a love that won't die?
Don't say Adiós, say Adiós, Goodbye.

Don't say Adiós, say Adiós, Goodbye.

Don't say Adiós, say Adiós, Goodbye.
