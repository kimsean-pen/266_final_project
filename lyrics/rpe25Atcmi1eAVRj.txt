You played hooky from school
And you can't go out to play, yeah
Mama said for the rest of the week
In your room you gotta stay, yeah
Now you feel like the whole world's pickin' on you
But deep down inside you know it ain't true

You've been punished 'cause your mother
Wants to raise you the right way, yeah
But you don't care, 'cause you already made up your mind
You wanna run away, yeah you're on your way

Run away child, running wild
Run away child, running wild
Better come back home, better come back home
Where you belong, where you belong

Roaming through the city, going nowhere fast
You're on your own at last
Hey it's getting late, where will you sleep
Gettin' kind-a hungry, you forgot to bring something to eat

Oh, lost with no money, you start to cry
But remember you left home wanting to be grown
So dry your weepin' eyes
Siren screamin' down, neon light is flickin', you want your mama

Ah, there's nothing for you
You're frightened and confused I want my mama
But she's much too far away
She can't hear a word you say

You heard some frightening news on the radio
About little boys running away from home
And their parents don't see them no more
You wanna stop hitch a ride and go home
But your mama told you never trust a stranger
And you don't know which way to go

Streets are dark and deserted
Not a sound nor sign of life
How you long to hear your mother's voice
'Cause you're lost and alone but remember you made the choice

Run away child, running wild
You, better go back home where you belong
Run away child, running wild
You, better go back home where you belong

You're lost in this great big city
Go back home where you belong
Not one familiar face; ain't a pity?
Go back home where you belong
Oh, runaway child runnin' wild
You'd better go back home where you belong

Run away child, running wild
You, better go back home where you belong

Mama, mama, please, come and see about me!
But she's much too far away; she can't hear a word you say
You're frightened and confused; which way will you choose?
