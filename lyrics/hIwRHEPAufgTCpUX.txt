You said we should look out further
I guess it wouldn't hurt us
We don't have to be around all these coffee shops
Now we got that percolator
Never made a latte greater
I'm savin' twenty three dollars a week
We drive to a house in Preston
We see police arresting
A man with his hand in a bag
How's that for first impressions
This place seems depressing
It's a California bungalow in a caul-de-sac
It's got a lovely garden
A garage for two cars to park in
Or a lot of storage if you've just got one
And it's going pretty cheap you say
Well it's a deceased's estate
Aren't the pressed Metal ceilings great
And I see the hand rail in the shower
A colleciton of those canisters for coffee tea and flower
And a photo of a young man in a van in Vietnam
And I can't think of floor boards anymore
Whether the front room faces south or north
And I wonder what she bought it for
If you've got a spare half a million
You could knock it down and start rebuilding
