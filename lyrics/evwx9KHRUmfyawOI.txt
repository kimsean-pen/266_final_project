I turn my body from the sun
To follow the fading phantom into the deep
All collapsed
And the great shroud of the sea
Rolled on as it rolled thousands of years ago
Your malice is my vengeance
Pull me, into deep
My body - drowned
But my hate is immortal
Dark and silent
Deeper, darker
Below the surface
Below the sun
Ghost of the sea
I am God's assassin
Ghost of the sea
I am God's assassin
My lifeless eyes
My tortured soul
I grin at the ocean, thou grinning whale
Dark and silent... deep
My body - drowned
But my hate is immortal
Ghost of the sea
I am God's assassin
My lifeless eyes
Deep
