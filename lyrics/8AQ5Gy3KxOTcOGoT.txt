The race of champions, the pace the pace
The speed the need, the need to seed
The chance to die
Another dead don't cry, another dead don't cry
You've still got speed, you'll maybe bleed
But that's next time
Less time than before, more speed than before
You're rich not poor, what are you doing it for?
Want more want more
Another dead don't cry, another dead don't cry
Indeed it's speed, to feed from speed
Doing it all the time
