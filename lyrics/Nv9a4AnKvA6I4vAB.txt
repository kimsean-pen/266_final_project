My sickness slips inside you
Drowning in my poison
Desperately I hide too from heaven
Now we'll be together
I can make you better
Siphon your pain in me, so I bleed

Feed your dreams to fishes
Lie about your wishes
Eat away at your time, seconds are mine
Sometimes it seems we're toxic
Wake me up and shock it
My low self-esteem

Can make me scream

In my tears
Don't let me drown
My fears
Don't make a sound
My tears
Don't break me down

In my tears
Don't let me drown

It's only my psychosis
Feeling thorns of roses
Fill the void inside me
So you see
Feed me tranquilizers

Calm the storm inside us
It's so perverse to say
That I'm blind

In my tears
Don't let me drown
My fears
Don't make a sound
My tears
Don't break me down
In my tears,
tears
In my tears
Don't let me drown
My fears
Don't make a sound
My tears
Don't break me down
Don't break me down
Don't let me drown
