In the daylight
I'm your sweetheart
Your goody-two-shoes prude is a work of art
But you don't know me
And soon you won't forget
Bad as can be, yeah you know I'm not so innocent

Better beware I go bump in the night
Devil-may-care with a lust for life
And I know you
Can't resist this
You know you
Are so addicted.
Boy you better run for your life!

Welcome to the nightmare in my head
(Oh god!)
Say hello to something scary
The monster in your bed
(Oh god!)
Just give in and you won't be sorry
Welcome to my other side
Hello it's Mz. Hyde!

I can be the bitch
I can play the whore
Or your fairytale princess who could ask for more
A touch of wicked
A pinch of ris-kay
Good girl gone bad, my poison is your remedy

Better be scared, better be afraid
Now that the beast is out of her cage
And I know you
Wanna risk it
You know you
Are so addicted
Boy, you better run for your life!

Welcome to the nightmare in my head
(My god!)
Say hello to something scary
The monster in your bed
(My god!)
Just give in and you won't be sorry
Welcome to my evil side
Hello it's Mz. Hyde!
Hello it's Mz. Hyde!
Hello it's Mz. Hyde!

I'm the spider crawling down your spine
Underneath your skin
I will gently violate your mind
Before I tuck you in
Put on the blindfold
There's no way to be sure
Which girl you'll get tonight!
(It's me, Lzzy, I swear!)

Welcome to the nightmare in my head
(My god!)
Say hello to something scary
The monster in your bed
(My god!)
Just give in and you won't be sorry
The nightmare in my head
(Oh god!)
Say hello to something scary
The monster in your bed
(Oh god!)
Just give in and you won't be sorry
Welcome to my evil side
Hello it's Mz. Hyde!
Hello it's Mz. Hyde!
