It's a Friday night cookin' show
With a horse-meat dish
I had to stay in the freezer
All Thursday eve
Talkin' to that horse

I really had to go
Down to the sidewalk
The sky's all red
The street's filled with people
From a High School band

I escaped to a theatre
To see a girl
With long blonde hair
Right down to there
I escaped from a theatre to see a girl
With long blonde hair

We had to leave

We got in a tan van
Us two in the back
With Steve McGarrett
From Hawaii-Five-O
At the steering wheel
Speeding away we slide into a
Parking lot
And all in slow motion
These tough guys appear

We argue and fight
And one pulls a knife
He hits me in the back
But I'm all right,
I'm all right, (x3)

He's all right

I escaped from a theatre
To see a girl
With long blonde hair
Right down to there
I escaped from a theatre
To see a girl...
