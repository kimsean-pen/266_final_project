Been wasting all my time on complex and complexes
Didn't realise simple was so slight
But can I give in?
Or will I let myself be free?
Ahh-oh-oh

Been wasting all my sight on
Things that weren't meant to be
Didn't realise I was nearly there
But can I give in?
Or will I let our souls be free?
Ahh-oh-oh

And these bird sounds knock me out
Cheatin' fear and doubt
And as old pain fades away as fog with time
I don't mind the time
Take your time
'Cause there's people yet to taste before we love
And I've been in rougher waters than this flood
And there's things that keep me here on the up

Been wasting all my sight on
Things that weren't meant to be
Didn't realise I was nearly there
But can I give in?
Or will I let myself be free?
Ahh-oh-oh

And these bird sounds knock me out
Cheatin' fear and doubt
And as old pain fades away as fog with time
I don't mind the time
Take your time
'Cause there's people yet to taste before we love
And I hate to leave you waiting in the dark

Been wasting all my time on complex and complexes
Didn't realise simple was so slight
But can I give in?
Or will I let myself be free?
Ahh-oh-oh
But should I give in?
Or will I let ourselves be free?
Ahh-oh-oh
