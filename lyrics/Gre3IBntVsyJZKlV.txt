No pussyhole can come in our place
In our arena, in our establishment
And try talk the talk and walk the walk
And act like them don't know where we from
Like we don't have the biggest in hundred
Iggy, what you say?
What you say?
Bullet!

Classic, Sinatra, bad, Phantom of the Opera
Shuffle the deck, I be the queen in the pack
Gotcha, Lady Patra

Paper planes, roger that, 10-4
Got money, been had it, still gettin' more
All y'all in the building, but on different floors
Y'all couldn't see it how we see it on your tippie-toes
It get so chillin', so pretty, still pretty
Talkin' hits on hits, Maguire gones Griffin
Mash it up bring the queens of the dancehall with me
Pearl handle on the pistol, tell this world to come and get me
And I'm thummin' through designers to pick what you feel me proper
Hey, dudes come through the ranks, but we ain't shabba
Need me a rude boy, something straight out the shockers
Could drive a girl crazy, all the way off my rocker
Versaces over Allies, lookin' like you could pop a
No they thought I wouldn't make it, I'm lookin' like what's the matter?

But tell the money talk and that man not saying nada
The new classic, signed sincerely, Lady Patra

She's special, a phenomenon
Body strong like a stallion
She got me wild like an animal
Drop it, drop it, pon the floor
Drop it, drop it, pon the floor
You put your whine dynamical

Billion dollar shit, trillion dollar looks
Tell 'em broke bitch, read it in the books
You think tonight you got Louie and the your foot
You know you got gully on the hook

She said she need a real man
Oh yes she want a real one

So she fuck with a Jamaican
Done (Haha!)
Your body looking like a million dollar
The baddest bitch you ever seen
They wanna wanna be my baby momma
I fuck her like my enemy
