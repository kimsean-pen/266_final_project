but you know that I got nothing to say
It's so charming to look on your face
But your eyes inviting something I just can't do now

Just to shine some light on my day
Feels like ages since i've been out your way
I've been caught up with a handful of new sensations

I hear you calling, calling for me out in the night
But it's all bad and I know that
