Please clean your plate dear, the Lord above can see you
Don't you know people are starving in Korea?
Alcohol and razor blades and poisons and needles
Kindergarten people, they used 'em they need 'em
The over indulgent machines were their children

And there wasn't a way down on earth here to cool 'em
'Cause they look just like a human at Kresge's and Woolworth's
But decadent brains were at work to destroy
Brats in battalions were ruling the streets scene and
Generation landslide, close the gap between them

And I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies
Who never conceived those billion dollar babies

La la da da daa

Militant mothers hiding in the basement
Using pots and pans as their shields and their helmets
Molotov milk bottles heaved from pink high chairs
While mothers' lib burned birth certificate papers
And dad gets his allowance from his sonny the dealer

Who's pubic to the world but involved in high finance
Sister's out till 5, doing banker son's hours
But she owns a Maserati that's a gift from his father
Stop at full speed, at 100 miles per hour
The Colgate invisible shield finally got 'em

And I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies
Who never conceived those billion dollar babies

La la da da daa

No one gives an oink about prom night or football
'Cause just getting at home from school safe is a gamble and a blessing
Girlsies play with girlsies and boysies with boysies
Bored with one another, like old broken Christmas toysies
Kids are all hot and their parents so annoisy

And I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies
Who never conceived those billion dollar babies
