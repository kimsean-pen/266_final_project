We had a good night, jamming away
There was a full moon showing and we started to play
But in the cold light of day next morning
Party was over, uh, uh
The party was over

We got love and we got style
And we got sex and I know, I know we got what it takes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why don't you come back and play?

Come back and play (hey, hey)
Come back and play
We got all night, all-day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come back and play? (Hey, hey)
Come back and play
Come back and play, come back and play
Play, play, play

(Go get 'em, boy, let's party)
(Yeah)
(Give it, give it)

We had a food fight in somebody's face
We were up all night, singing (singing)
And giving a chase
But in the cold light of day next morning
Everybody was hungover

Hey, come back and play (come back and play)
Come back and play
We got all night, all-day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come back and play (and play)
Come back and play
We got all night, we got all-day
We got all night to play
Come back, come back, come back, come back, come back and play

(Hey, hey, hey)
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, the party is ov-
