Sleep on floors 'cause I can't go back,
My whole life in a plastic sack
Temperature's falling,
Like a drug you sucked me in

Late at night when I'm all alone,
Can't sleep 'cause something's wrong
Think I need something,
Like a drug I just can't win

On my knees darling, so demanding,
Find a vein sweetheart, plug yourself in.

You're like a drug that I just can't kick
I give you up and it makes me sick
The shakes come on and they come on quick
You're like the drug that I just can't quit

My friends say you're no good for me
They tell me constantly
I never listen
Like a drug you're everything.

On my knees darling, so demanding,
Find a vein sweetheart, plug yourself in

You're like a drug that I just can't kick
I give you up and it makes me sick
The shakes come on and they come on quick
You're like a drug that I just can't quit

They try to fade you, I try to get clean
Oh, you're never gonna leave,
You've taken all of me and
I feel so strung out
Thought I heard you said something like
You'll get your pill
And there's only one way out of here

You're like a drug that I just can't kick
I give you up and it makes me sick
The shakes come on and they come on quick
You're like a drug that I just can't quit
