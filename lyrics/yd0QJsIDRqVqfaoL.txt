Radiated destruction
Repeated dawning of a new age
Fertile cerebral birth
Built from dust
Eclipsing thought, brings flesh
Useless, diseased
Aural shapes, through the gateway
Consciousness, flowing forth
Inhumane toil, mentally enslaved
Bloodline tainted, obscured
Synaptic misfire, false creation
Chambers of cursed mortality
Womb of the earth
To see beyond all spectrums
Boundaries beyond death
Time forged in essence
Ethereal manifestation
Summoned by desolate visions
Neurotic waves falter, transient
Formulated procreation
Growth of knowledge, artificial
Sensory downward spiral
Death... Rebirth... Singularity
Vortex of thought
Breeding, what lies beneath
