Father Lucifer, you never looked so sane
You always did prefer the drizzle to the rain
Tell me that you're still in love with that milk-maid
How's the Lizzies?
How's your Jesus Christ been hanging?

Nothing's going to stop me from floating
Nothing's going to stop me from floating

He says he reckons I'm a watercolour stain
He says I run and then I run from him and then I run
He didn't see me watching from the aeroplane
He wiped a tear and then he threw away our apple-seed

Nothing's going to stop me from floating
Nothing's going to stop me from floating

Hey... yes...
Every day's my wedding day.
(Go away where only glass Georgy Girl)
Though baby's still in his comatose state.
(Your favorite skiddly-dee, and I'm G., yes,)
Die my own Easter eggs.
(Never go, go so fast...)
Just don't go yet, just don't go.
(Go wait, girl, on bead glass,)

And Beenie lost the sunset but that's okay.
(Georgy- she was your favorite,)

Does Joe bring flowers to Marilyn's grave?
(There she goes... there she goes...)

And girls that eat pizza and never gain weight,
(There she even goes home...)

Never gain weight, never gain weight...

Father Lucifer, you never looked so sane
You always did prefer the drizzle to the rain
Tell me that you're still in love with that milk-maid
How's the Lizzies?
How's your Jesus Christ been hanging?
