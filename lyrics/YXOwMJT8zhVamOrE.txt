From when I met you, first time
A Rosy dawn painted the sky
And all of nature conspired
To reflect our world inside

Through days of silence we'd glide
All was said between our eyes
And in our wonder, went blind
To the hearts we left behind

Nights of song and days of silence
In a world that's born inside
And our faces in the morning
Reflect the stars within our eyes

Now in the mirror of time
Looking at reflections of life
Despite mistakes and trials
Still the stars are shining bright

Nights of song and days of silence
In a world outside of time
And our faces in the morning
Reflect the stars within our eyes

Nights of song and days of silence
In a world that's born inside
And our faces in the morning
Reflect the stars within our eyes
