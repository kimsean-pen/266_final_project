Grandma came to see
Something she could not believe
How could her girl be so naive
Tar baby
Tar baby told the secret she conceived
Oh... that big old smile of yours
Could turn the wind into a song
How could I have doubted
Honey it's with me that you belong
Tar baby
Tar baby I love you so
I love you
Like a brand new blade... you cut into my life
Cut through two decades
(decades)
Like a hot coal on ice
Baby baby baby baby baby baby babe
Tar baby my tar baby
It maybe was meant to be when I look at you
I can't believe my eyes
With your magic
I think you just might charm the birds out of the skies
Tar baby
Tar baby tar baby
Came good out of grief
A golden thread inside of the web that I got caught in
Oh it's a lovers revenge
But out of the pain comes the best things
You cut into my life
You cut into my life
Baby baby baby baby baby baby babe
Don't you know that you cut into my life...
Love you
You cut into my life
La-la-la-la-la ooh
You can turn the wind into a song
La-la-la-la-la baby baby baby
It's with me you belong
