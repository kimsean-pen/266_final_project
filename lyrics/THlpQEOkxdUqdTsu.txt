You're beginning to hate me
Of who I'm becoming lately
Oh please, don't look at me like that
I feel like I'm having a heart attack
Don't you say that you don't want me around
I'm not changing, I'm just waiting to figure myself out

You don't love us anymore but I do, I do
You don't think we're worth it but I do, I do
You don't love us anymore but I do, I do
You don't think we're worth it but I do, I do
I feel like I'm having a heart attack

I miss the way you were with me
And you'd stroke my face so softly
And kiss me on the head when I can't sleep
And I know that I'm argumentative
Why did I make you feel so wrong?
All I ever seemed to do is ache for you
I love you, but I know that is overdue

You don't love us anymore but I do, I do
You don't think we're worth it but I do, I do
You don't love us anymore but I do, I do
You don't think we're worth it but I do, I do

Crying outside your house
But you won't come out
And on the phone you screamed
That you're done with me
(You turned black)

You don't love us anymore but I do, I do
You don't love us anymore but I do, I do
You don't love us anymore but I do, I do
You don't think we're worth it but I do, I do
You don't love us anymore but I do, I do
You don't think we're worth it but I do, I do
