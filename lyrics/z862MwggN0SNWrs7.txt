You're a troublemaker
You're a troublemaker
Eh, you ain't nothing but a troublemaker, girl

You had me hooked again from the minute you sat down
The way you bite your lip, got my head spinnin' around
After a drink or two I was putty in your hands
I don't know if I have the strength to stand

Oh, trouble, troublemaker, yeah, that's your middle name
Oh, I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain

And I wanna know

Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad? Whoa
My mind keeps saying, "Run as fast as you can"
I say I'm done, but then pull me back, whoa
I swear you're giving me a heart attack

Troublemaker

It's like you're always there in the corners of my mind
I see a silhouette every time I close my eyes
There must be poison in those finger tips of yours
'Cause I keep comin' back again for more

Oh, trouble, troublemaker, yeah, that's your middle name
Oh, I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain

And I wanna know

Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad? Whoa
My mind keeps saying, "Run as fast as you can"
I say I'm done, but then pull me back, whoa
I swear you're giving me a heart attack

Troublemaker

Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad? Whoa
My mind keeps saying, "Run as fast as you can"
You're troublemaker

I say I'm done, but then pull me back, whoa
I swear you're giving me a heart attack
Troublemaker

Maybe I'm insane
'Cause I keep doing the same damn thing
Think one day we gonna change
But you know just how to work that back

And make me forget my name
What the Hell you do I won't remember
I'll be gone until November
And you'll show up again next summer, yeah

Typical middle name is Prada
Fit you like a glove, girl, I'm sick of the drama
You're a troublemaker
But damn, girl, it's like I love the trouble
And I can't even explain why

Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad? Whoa
My mind keeps saying, "Run as fast as you can"
Troublemaker

I say I'm done, but then pull me back, whoa
I swear you're giving me a heart attack
Troublemaker

Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad? Whoa
My mind keeps saying, "Run as fast as you can"
Troublemaker

I say I'm done, but then pull me back, whoa
I swear you're giving me a heart attack
You're troublemaker
