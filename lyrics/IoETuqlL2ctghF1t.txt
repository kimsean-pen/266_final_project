I always knew I had a voice but only used it when I'm all alone
Am I sick and deep, but standin' tall
Only thing that kept me goin' were the haters
That would say that I could never make it on my own
Maybe one day I could prove 'em wrong

Don't wake me up and go-whoa
Don't wake me up and go-whoa

I've been dreamin', I've been dreamin'
I've been dreamin' of this day for a long time
I've been dreamin', I've been dreamin'
I've been dreamin' of this day for a long time
I've been waitin' for this moment since I was young
With thoughts and ideas about the sun
I've been dreamin', I've been dreamin'
I've been dreamin' of this day for a long time

I try and jump across a mountain thinkin' I know where I need to go
I always end up at the bottom where I started off
'Cause I was walkin' down the street with no reason
Thinkin' I could never amount to nothin', oh no
Maybe one day I could prove 'em wrong

Don't wake me up and go-whoa
Don't wake me up and go-whoa

I've been dreamin', I've been dreamin'
I've been dreamin' of this day for a long time
I've been dreamin', I've been dreamin'
I've been dreamin' of this day for a long time
I've been waitin' for this moment since I was young
With thoughts and ideas about the sun
I've been dreamin', I've been dreamin'
I've been dreamin' of this day for a long time

I came alive, I came alive
I came alive, I came alive
I came alive, I came alive
I came alive, I came alive

I've been dreamin', I've been dreamin'
I've been dreamin' of this day for a long time
I've been dreamin', I've been dreamin'
I've been dreamin' of this day for a long time
I've been waitin' for this moment since I was young
With thoughts and ideas about the sun
I've been dreamin', I've been dreamin'
I've been dreamin' of this day for a long time
