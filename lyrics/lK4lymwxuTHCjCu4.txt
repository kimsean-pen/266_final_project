greed for cash causes your blindness
creates obsession for might and fame
guide the flames for the endless time
unleashes your desire

greed - obsession - it burns in you
desire - for more and more
greed - obsession attracts a new
desire - for more and more

your inner addiction destroys your life
not noticed your brain eaten back to life
contaminates your thoughts
destroys your life more and more

desire makes you mindless
it kills every emotion in your heart
releases the pressure from your soul
estranged from society of man
