It's we the people
Who spawned this rage
The violent people
Who dawned this age
Who dawned this age

Convulse and kill (kill)
Tremble, blood spills (spills)
Ruination our divination

Caustic are the ties that bind
Like barbed wire, taut and fine
Tied around the wrists that plead
Crimson for the dark to feed

Why can't we see (why can't we see)
What's come to be (what's come to be)
We broke the lifeblood (we broke the lifeblood)
We're drowned in death's flood
We're drowned in death's flood

Convulse and kill (kill)
Tremble, blood spills (spills)
Ruination our divination

Caustic are the ties that bind
Like barbed wire, taut and fine
Tied around the wrists that plead
Crimson for the dark to feed
Caustic are the ties that bind

It surges through us all
A lack of self-control
A sighing, vacant soul
Plunged headfirst in the deep
Nothing for us to keep
Only sounding a weep
Can you help me find my way?
I've been lost for so long
I don't even know where it went wrong
Can you help me?
Can you help me?

Find strength to armor me
To face my enemies
A whispered, draining plea
Can you help me find my way?
I've been lost for so long
I don't even know where it went wrong
Can you help me?
Can you help me?

Caustic are the ties that bind
Like barbed wire, taut and fine
Tied around the wrists that plead
Crimson for the dark to feed
Caustic are the ties that bind
