Sometimes
When I lie awake at night
I think about how far
We made it
Together
We were wild
I knew we would always be
Maybe it's all part of finding
Our heaven
Even if it breaks your heart
Even if it tears your world apart
Still you keep holding on
If something's worth saving
All of our hopes and fears
They may get tangled but love's sincere
So we keep holding on
To something worth saving
Even if it breaks your heart
My hopes (my hopes)
They only align with yours
They're only as big as
We both aim to make them
For love
If I had a thousand lives
I'd find you a thousand times
You know I'd come back again
Oh even if it breaks your heart
Even if it tears your world apart
Still you keep holding on
If something's worth saving
All of our hopes and fears
They may get tangled but love's sincere
So we keep holding on
To something worth saving
Even if it breaks your heart
How good it could be
I knew it would be somehow
And now I know now that it is
Who could imagine
With all that's happened
The names, the fights, the insanely long nights
And I'm standing on top of the world
Yeah
And when the dust settles
You're standing right with me 'cause
Even if it breaks your heart
Even if it tears your world apart
Still you keep holding on
If something's worth saving
All of our hopes and fears
They may get tangled but love's sincere
So we keep holding on
To something worth saving
Even if it breaks your heart
