The longest time away
Last time the friends we made
Longest time away
Best friend's too cheap to stay
Well of course I'll go with you
Not every day I get to
Well of course I'll stay with you
How often?
Pictures tell so much, remind me often
Voice brings back so much situations
Between the money and your every move, acceptance
Between the money and your every move
Between the money and your every move, acceptance
We both know things never change
Between the money and your every move
We both know static prevails
If we take you away
You'll only stay away
The longest time away, my friend
Pictures tell so much, remind me often
Voice brings back so much situations
Between the money and your every move, acceptance
Between the money and your every move
Between the money and your every move, acceptance
Take a seat at your request
Between the money and your every move
Five years and I'm still there
We both know things never change
Take a seat at your request
We both know static prevails
Five years and I'm still there
We both know things never change
Take a seat at your request
We both know static prevails
Five years and I'm still there
