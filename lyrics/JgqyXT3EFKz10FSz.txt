Red lights, X-ray vision
That lowly drug is in my veins
Blood stained
Indecision
And holiness is burned away
Midnight, midnight calling
To color me insane
Still-life with roses in a vase
Thorn is in your hand
Unsent letters in a box
Frozen where you stand
Do you miss me, miss me, darling?
God knows, I'm missing you
Somewhere there's two trains colliding
That's what this sickness brought me to
Dead right
All night
When you feel the serpent strike
Nocturne

Blacklight
House of mirrors
The heavens open up and bleed
Face down
Drifting backwards
A lonely river to the sea
Midnight, midnight calling
Coloring my dreams
Anchor chained around your neck
Christ is in your hands
Whispering behind your back
Falling where you stand
Do you miss me, miss me, darling?
God knows I'm missing you
I can see two cars colliding
That's what this sickness brought me to
Do you miss me, miss me, darling?
Do you know I'm missing you
Can't you see the world is ending
That's what this damage took me to
Dead right
All night
When you feel the spider bite
Nocturne
Nocturne

Do you miss me, miss me, darling?
God knows I'm missing you
I can see two worlds colliding
That's what the sickness brought me to
Dead right
All night
When you feel the serpent strike
Nocturne
Nocturne
Nocturne
