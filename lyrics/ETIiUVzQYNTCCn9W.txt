Blood is pumping, heart is beating again
No frame of reference for this altered state
Time kept running in my temporary absence

Blindly watching in the gardens of the awakened
Perseverance of a soul misplaced
Sole survivor on a desolate place

No welcoming faces
I am the first
No others to greet me
I am the first

Endless paths to take, leading far away

I am the first...

Endless paths to take, leading far away

I am the first Immortal
I am the first
I am the first Immortal

Part man, part machine
Wearing my synthetic skin

I am the first
I am the last!
