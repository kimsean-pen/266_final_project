It's been thirty six days
And a couple hours since I saw your face
And the words you whispered left me in a daze
I've been memorising every single phrase
You said as you walked away
An ocean in between us, can never separate us
Though we're a million miles apart
My love goes any distance
Traveling with no resistance
I might be far away but I've got your heart
Whenever you're in need of my arms again,
Instead of looking out from the dirty window pane
Go out and kiss the rain
Go out and kiss the rain
I'm in every raindrop, never will stop now
Go out and kiss the rain (kiss, kiss, kiss the rain)
I just wanna (kiss, kiss kiss the rain)
I just wanna (kiss, kiss kiss the rain)
I can stay another week, then your time is up
No longer yours to keep
And the sunshine and the rain is bittersweet
So bittersweet
An ocean in between us, can never separate us
Though we're a million miles apart
My love goes any distance
Traveling with no resistance
I might be far away but I've got your heart
Whenever you're in need of my arms again,
Instead of looking out from the dirty window pane
Go out and kiss the rain
Go out and kiss the rain
I'm in every raindrop, never will stop now
Go out and kiss the rain (kiss, kiss, kiss the rain)
I just wanna (kiss, kiss kiss the rain)
I just wanna (kiss, kiss kiss the rain)
I just wanna (kiss, kiss kiss the rain)
(kiss, kiss kiss the rain)
I wanna run through a thunderstorm here and now
Just to feel your touch on my lips (aaahh)
And I'll be waiting for you under the biggest cloud
Never knew a love this
Whenever you're in need of my arms again
Instead of looking out from the dirty window pane
Go out and kiss the rain
Go out and kiss the rain
I'm in every raindrop, never will stop now
Go out and kiss the rain (kiss, kiss, kiss the rain)
I just wanna (kiss, kiss kiss the rain)
(kiss, kiss kiss the rain)
I just wanna (kiss, kiss kiss the rain)
