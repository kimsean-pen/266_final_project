Open the door and come in,
I'm so glad to see you my friend,
I don't know how long it's been
Havin' these feelings again
And now I see that you're so happy, and oohhh
It just sets me free and
I like to see us as good friends as we used to be
My love,

You're in love
That's the way it should be
'Cause I want you to be happy
You're in love
And I know
That you're not in love with me, oohhh
It's enough for me to know that you're in love
Now I let you go
'Cause I know that you're in love

Sometimes it's hard to believe
That you're never coming back for me
I had this dream that you'd always be by my side
Ooh, I could've died
But now I see that you're so happy (see that you're so happy)
Ooohh, It just sets me free and
I'd like to see us as good friends as we used to be
My love

You're in love
That's the way it should be
'Cause I want you to be happy
You're in love
And I know
That you're not in love with me, oohh
It's enough for me to know that you're in love
I can let you go
'Cause I know that you are in love

I tried to find you
But you were so far away
I was praying that fate would bring you back to me
Someday (someday), someday (someday)
woohhh, you're in love

ooohh It's enough for me to know that you're in love,
oooh, now I'll let you go
'Cause I know that you're in love

no no no no no no ooh
