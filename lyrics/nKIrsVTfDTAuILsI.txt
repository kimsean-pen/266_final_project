The road I walk is paved in gold
To glorify my platinum soul
I'll buy my way to talk to God
So he can live with what I'm not
This selfish blood runs through my veins
I gave up everything for fame
I am the lie that humans are
I feed the rich and fuck the poor

I got what you want
It just don't stop

I got what you want
It just don't stop
This is entertainment
Lies are entertainment
You are down on your knees
Begging me for more

The road I walk is paved in gold

To glorify my platinum soul
I am the closest thing to God
So worship me and never stop

The wretched blood runs through my veins
I gave up everything for fame
I am the lie that humans are
I feed the rich and fuck the poor

I got what you want
It just don't stop
I got what you want

It just don't stop
This is entertainment
Lies are entertainment
You are down on your knees
begging me for more

Dear future
I bought you
I own the right
To let go
Destroy you
This is my life
Dear future
I bought you
I own the right
To let go
Destroy you
This is my life
And I...
I got what you want
It just don't stop
I got what you want
It just don't stop
This is entertainment
Lies are entertainment
You are down on your knees
Begging me for more
Begging me for more
Begging me for more
