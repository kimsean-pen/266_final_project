"That's what I believe got him re-elected is the people knew that you could believe what he said."
"Well that's your repressive government."
"Our country is strong" ("How many people to march I don't know")
"We go forward to defend freedom" ("Take the government's side")
"And all that is good and just ("JUST yeah right") in our world."

All my devotion betrayed
I am no longer afraid
I was too blinded to see
How much you've stolen from me

You wanna know why I feel so horrified?
I let my innocence die
You wanna know why I can't be pacified?
You made me bury something
I won't be sleeping tonight

I only wanted the blessing made
Now I've been labeled a renegade
It seems so clear now what I must do
You're no immortal
I won't let them
Deify you
They view you as the new messiah
Deify you
Renew belief in some demented man

You wanna know why it seems the passion's died?
We've all been living this lie
You wanna know why my will's been fortified?
You've made me hunger again
Good luck sleeping tonight

I only wanted the blessing made
Now I've been labeled a renegade
It seems so clear now what I must do
You're no immortal
I won't let them
Deify you
They view you as the new messiah
Deify you
Renew belief in some demented man

All my devotion betrayed
I am no longer afraid
All my devotion betrayed
I am no longer afraid
I was too blinded to see
I was too blinded to see
All my devotion betrayed
I am no longer afraid
I was too blinded to see
How much you've stolen from me

Deify you
They view you as the new messiah
Deify you
Renew belief in some demented man

Deify you
(All my devotion betrayed)
They view you as the new messiah
(I am no longer afraid)
Deify you
(I was too blinded to see)
Renew belief in some demented man
(How much you've stolen from me)
