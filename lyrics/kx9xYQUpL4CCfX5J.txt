Drinking in the morning sun
Blinking in the morning sun
Shaking off a heavy one
Oh, heavy like a loaded gun

What made me behave that way?
Using words i never say
I can only think it must be love
Oh anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

Someone tell me how i feel
It's silly wrong, but vivid right
Oh, kiss me like a final meal
Yeah, kiss me like we die tonight

'cause holy cow, i love your eyes
And only now i see the light
Yeah, lying with you half awake
Oh, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

When my face is chamois creased
If you think i wink, i did
Laugh politely at repeats
Oh, kiss me when my lips are thin

'cause holy cow, i love your eyes
And only now i see the light
Yeah, lying with you half awake
Stumbling over what to say
Well, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

So throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right

Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
(for life)

Throw those curtains wide
(holy cow, i love your eyes)
One day like this a year would see me right
(and only now i see the light)

Throw those curtains wide
(holy cow, i love your eyes)
One day like this a year would see me right
(and only now i see the light)

Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
(for life) (4)
