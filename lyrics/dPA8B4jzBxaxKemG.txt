Please put me to bed
And turn down the light

Fold out your hands
Give me a sign
Hold down your lies
Lay down next to me
Don't listen when I scream
Bury your doubts and fall asleep
Find out:
I was just a bad dream

Let the bed sheet
Soak up my tears
And watch the only way out disappear
Don't tell me why
Kiss me goodbye

for Neither ever, nor never
Goodbye
Neither ever, nor never
Goodbye
Neither ever, nor never
Goodbye
Goodbye
Neither ever, nor never
Goodbye
Goodbye
