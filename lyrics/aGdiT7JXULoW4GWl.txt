It past midnight a couple hours ago
It feels colder more than ever for this time of year
I tucked you in while you were sleeping
And folded your clothes at the end of the bed
Do you remember the times we used to dance together?
And sing our favorite records, that used to stick in our heads?

I'm sorry for the mess I've made
When you wake up I'll finally be gone from this place
I'm sorry for the mess I've made
Soon enough you won't remember my face

(Please stay, stay away)
You're making it harder to breathe
(Please stay, stay away)
You're making it harder to leave
(Please stay, stay away)
You're making it harder to breathe
(Please stay, stay away)
You're making it harder to leave
Stay away from me

Do you remember the awkward smile when we first met?
The childish love we should have kept
Do you remember falling in and out of love together?
Do you remember the good times as well as I do?
Feels like it should have lasted forever
What good is your heart if it doesn't break?

Do you remember me?
Young, naive and turning nineteen

It past midnight a couple hours ago
I can hear the music playing down the street
In the back of my head like a detuned radio
Stuck with an image of you wearing my mother's old green coat
That you took from me and wore it like it was your own

(Please stay, stay away)
You're making it harder to breathe
(Please stay, stay away)
You're making it harder to leave
(Please stay, stay away)
You're making it harder to breathe
(Please stay, stay away)
You're making it harder to leave
Stay away from me

Do you remember me?
Young, naive and turning nineteen
