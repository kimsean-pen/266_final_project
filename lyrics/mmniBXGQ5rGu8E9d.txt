Stars shining bright above you,
Night breezes seem to whisper, "I love you",
Birds singing in the sycamore tree,
"Dream A Little Dream Of Me".
Just say "goodnight" and kiss me,
Oh, hold me tight and tell me you miss me;
While I'm alone and blue as can be,
Dream A Little Dream Of Me.
Stars fading, but I linger on, dear,
Still craving your kiss;
I'm longing to linger till dawn, my dear,

Just saying this:
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you,
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you,
But in your dreams whatever they be,
Dream A Little Dream Of Me.
Say "nightie-night" and kiss me,
Oh, hold me tight and tell me you miss me;
While I'm alone and blue as can be,
Dream A Little Dream Of Me.
Dream A little dream of you and me.
