Come away... soon we will
Come away... hearts grow fonder
I know what it's there for
I know what it's worth
I know what it's there for
I know what it's worth

Soon we will belong
Summer's coming, now we're coming
Back where we belong
Soon she's coming, back where we belong

Come away... soon we will
Come away... hearts drive on
I know what it's there for (soothe me carefully)
I know what it's worth!

Soon we will belong
Summer's coming, now we're coming
Back where we belong
Soon she's coming, back where we belong

Soon we will be strong
Summer's coming, now she's coming
Back where we belong
Soon we're coming, back where we,
Oh, back where we belong.

Back where we belong.
