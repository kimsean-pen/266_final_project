Where is the rain that purifies and retaliates?
Where is the one I begged for strength to carry on?
Speak to me, I have followed through
Deliver me from guilt, take me home

To the source of white light, I offer my place
My sacrifice for its life
The guilt that stains me vanishes on the other side

Where is the rain that purifies and retaliates?
Where is the one I begged for strength to carry on?
Walking along the river's flow
A journey away from original sin

You and I merge, we become one
