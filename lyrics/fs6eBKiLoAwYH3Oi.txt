Riding this one out for something
Arriving at a cloud of nothing
Slowly come down unfolding
I knew I had my doubts but oh

I think about the love we won't discover
Living like we do
I think you'll find you'd rather see your mother to remind you

Deeper into sin oh deeper
Vulgarity don't give in either
Take me somewhere else just somewhere
Feels like I am dying a slow death

Arriving at a cloud from nowhere
Slowly come down to somewhere

I think about the love we won't discover
Living like we do
I think you'll find you'd rather see your mother to remind you

Midnight
Can't get no rest because my soul [?]
Waking up in sunrise
Indifferent to the clear blue skies

I think about the love we won't discover
Living like we do
I think you'll find you'd rather see your mother to remind you
I think about the love we won't discover
Living like we do
Living like we do
