For the price of a cup of tea
You'd get a line of coke
For the price of a night with me
You'd be the village joke

For the price of a pint of milk
I'll tell you all I know
About the state of the world today
Sit down, enjoy the show

She had several hours to find a place to stay
Try the coffee shop, but somewhere on the way
She heard about a place somewhere she could go
Walked a couple of blocks to her destination

For the price of a cup of tea
You'd get a seven inches
Soul black vinyl to stop your tears
You can use my stereo

She just wants to be accepted in this place
But there's something in her face
She will always seem exotic and aloof
If you want to know the truth

Her friends the stars dripping from the jeweled sky
When she was passing by, would keep her calm
There was people that she knew, at least she thought she did
Be easy on the kid

She took her winter coat from her plastic wrapper
Pushed back her fringe, see her birthmark
She will finally be the person she wanted to be

For the price of a cup of tea
For the price of a cup of tea
For the price of a cup of tea
For the price of a cup of tea

For the price of a cup of tea
For the price of a cup of tea
For the price of a cup of tea
Take a walk, you should follow me
