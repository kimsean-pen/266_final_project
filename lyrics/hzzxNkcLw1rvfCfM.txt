Come on, get up

Get up, get up, get up
I'mma show you everything I've got inside
I won't give up, give up
Never backing down, this is my fight

Come on

How do you live when every finger's pointing in your face?
How do you give your heart to something only you embrace?
How do you put your mind to something that you love?
When you were growing up,
everybody told you that you weren't good enough
Good enough would work for me; instead of love, you hurt me deep
Broke my trust and watched me bleed,
ignored my pleas and squashed my dreams
Everything hiding underneath is coming out for you to see
The screams kept hidden down beneath, a broken spirit are finally free

Come on get up

Get up, get up, get up
I'mma show you everything I've got inside
I won't give up, give up
Never backing down, this is my fight

Everything we do in life has got to be for something
I won't go down without a fight, no, I won't die for nothing
You held me under too long, I see a coming end
Take back your hand, you'renot my friend; to me, you're fucking dead
All the things you did and do showed me the colors inside you
I now know all your hidden truths; if I were you, shit, I'd lie too
It's my turn now, I'll burn you down, nowhere to run and hide for you
It's tried and true,
and I'll get through, I'll watch your spirit die in you

Get up, get up, get up
I'mma show you everything I've got inside
I won't give up, give up
Never backing down, this is my fight

Every word you said had you thinking in your head
You'd leave me here for dead but I'm alive
Get up, get up, get up
I'mma show you everything I've got inside

You brought me down in ways I can't imagine
You made me believe, it's true!
It's what I've got inside, this is my fight
I hate the way you drag me down!
I'm not afraid 'cause this ends now!
I hate the way you drag me down, down!
This ends now!

Get up, get up, get up
I'mma show you everything I've got inside
I won't give up, give up
Never backing down this is my fight

Every word you said had you thinking in your head
You'd leave me here for dead but I'm alive
Get up, get up, get up
I'mma show you everything I've got inside

I hate the way you drag me down!
I'm not afraid 'cause this ends now!
