Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Remember when I saw you for the first time
I never thought you'd be mine
Then we went ahead and fell in love

Heaven was our common ground
We were never coming down
The two of us, we had more than enough

You and I are not the same
To you love is just a game
Things will never be the same again

So now goodbye, this time I will be gone, goodbye
I stayed for way too long, it started out with trust
But it isn't just about the good times baby

Remember all the promises we swore to
Can't say I didn't warn you
How I did adore you way back then
(I did adore you, adore you, adore you)

But you broke a solemn vow
Ha! You're paying for it now
Wouldn't you expect more from a friend

You and I are not the same
To you love is just a game
Things will never be the same again

So now goodbye, this time I will be gone, goodbye
I stayed for way too long, it started out with trust
But it isn't just about the good times baby

This is why I'm saying goodbye, this time I will be gone goodbye
I stayed for way too long, I don't need your lust
And I am oh so tired of excuses baby
Don't make excuses baby

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Goodbye, this time will be gone, goodbye
I stayed for way to long this time, it started out with trust
But it isn't about the good times baby

So now goodbye, this time I will be gone goodbye
I stayed for way too long, I don't need your lust
And I am oh so tired of excuses baby

This is why I'm saying goodbye, this time I will be gone goodbye
I stayed for way too long, it started out with trust
But it isn't just about the good times baby

So now goodbye, this time I will be gone goodbye
I stayed for way too long, I don't need your lust
And I am oh so tired of excuses baby
