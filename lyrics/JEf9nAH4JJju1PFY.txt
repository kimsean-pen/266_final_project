Some people call me the space cowboy
Yeah
Some call me the gangster of love
Some people call me Maurice
'Cause I speak of the pompatus of love

People talk about me baby
Say I'm doin' you wrong doin' you wrong
Well don't you worry baby don't worry
'Cause I'm right here right here right here right here at home

'Cause I'm a picker
I'm a grinner
I'm a lover and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun

I'm a joker
I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I sure don't want to hurt no one

I'm a picker
I'm a grinner
I'm a lover and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun

I'm a joker

I'm a midnight toker
I get my lovin' on run
W-o-o-o h-o-o-o
W-o-o-o h-o-o-o

Want to shake your tree
Lovey dovey lovey dovey lovey dovey all the time

'Cause I'm a picker
I'm a grinner
I'm a lover and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun

I'm a joker

I'm a midnight toker
I get my lovin' on the run

I'm a picker
I'm a grinner
I'm a lover and I'm a sinner
l play my music in the sun

I'm a joker
