This is not a song about his lips
This is not another tender wish
That was then and this are different days
Even now I sometimes miss the taste

This is not a song about the night
When we were young and everything was right
When all the things we did just seemed to work
Now the news is old, and it all just seems to hurt, just seems to hurt
Don't talk about what we are
Don't talk about what we've been
What's done is done, I don't want to talk about it
It's never just one mistake
It's never just one heartbreak
What's done is done, I don't want to talk about it

This is not for all the tears we cried
It's not another worthless little fight
It all comes back to me with no regrets
I rather let it go than just forget, just forget

Don't talk about what we are
Don't talk about what we've been
What's done is done, I don't want to talk about it
It's never just one mistake
It's never just one heartbreak
What's done is done, I don't want to talk about it

All of the good that remains
All that memory contains
All that is still in it's place after he walked away
He is the reason
You are the reason why I...
Don't talk about what we are
Don't talk about what we've been
What's done is done, I don't want to talk about it
It's never just one mistake
It's never just one heartbreak
What's done is done, I don't want to talk about it

Don't talk about what we are
Don't talk about what we've been
What's done is done, it's done, is done
I don't want to talk about it
I don't want to talk about it
It's done, is done
I don't want to talk about it

It's just never just one mistake
It's just never just one heartbreak
What's done is done, I don't want to talk about it
