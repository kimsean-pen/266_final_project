Stubbing out progress where seeds are sown
Killing off anything that's not quite known
Sitting around in a nice, safe home
Waiting for the witch hunt.

Idle plans for the idol rich
Knitting the economy, not dropping a stitch
Destroying anything that doesn't quite fit
Waiting for the witch hunt.

Still living with the english fear
Waiting for the witch hunt, there
Always living with the english fear
Waiting for the witch hunt, there.

Changing your course for another way
You better stop that or be willing to pay
Never mind son you'll come around some day
Under pressure from the witch hunt.
