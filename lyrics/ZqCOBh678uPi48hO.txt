Hey, hey, hey, eh eh eyy

Let me get straight to it,
I've bit off more than I could chew
I felt the sting and slap of failure missed my due
Like a hard knife, cutting through a slice
Of ego of ambition yeah put me off my mission,
I've been wandering alleys in a dirty shirt,
Taking this and that 'cause I had so much hurt,
I'm not plying you with liquor
For you tongue to get a flicker
I just need to tell my story
If you're drunk I'll get done quicker.

Hey hey gotta keep the hope up
Gotta keep your eye on the prize
Hey hey gotta keep the highs up,
I'm an optimist of the most dangerous kind
There is more to this life
I must believe there is more to this life.
There is more to this life
I must believe there is more to this life.

Let me get straight to it,
There's more explaining I could do
But I am here just for diversion
As are you
Don't mean to jump the gun,
But we could have some fun
There's little sense in dishing

Since I've noticed you're not listening
I'm feeling fairly lucky
I've been surfing shadows of success in my dreams,
And yes I know my guard's down
But I don't mind if you, see.

Hey hey gotta keep the hope up
Gotta keep your eye on the prize
Hey-hey gotta keep the highs up,
I'm an optimist of the most dangerous kind
There is more to this life
I must believe there is more to this life.
There is more to this life
I must believe there is more to this life.

This life, this life, this life...

Hey, hey, hey, eh eh eyy
Hey, hey, hey, eh eh eyy
There is more to this life,
I must believe there is more to this life
There is more to this life.
I must believe there is more to this life
