Oh kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Your tongue's like poison
So swollen it fills up my mouth

Just, just love me, love me, love me
You nail me to the floor
And push my guts all inside out

Just get it out
Get it out
Get it out
Get your fucking voice out of my head

I never wanted this
Never wanted any of this
I wish you were dead
I wish you were dead
