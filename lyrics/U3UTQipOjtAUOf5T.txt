how many times have i been through this before
and every time i find an opening i lose the door
i've got to find it one day, my time will have to come
it'll be so good to feel the wind and see the summer sun
my body's dying slowly, so slowly piece by piece
my life has got a hold of me and it will not release
if only i could break away and lay myself to rest
i know that it's the cowards way but i think that it is best
