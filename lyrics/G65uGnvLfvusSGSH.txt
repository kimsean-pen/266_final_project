I was angry, angry for a while
Tore my heart out, it got us a crowd
You were saying "She will never change"
Stop complaining, cause you're in my way

Can I get it right back? Can I get it right back?
I'm calling out
Can I get it right back? Can I get it right back?
I'm calling
Can I get it right back? Can I get it right back?
I'm calling out
Can I get it right back?
You don't even know what I wanted

Aye!
I am here to stay
Get out of my way, start running
Aye!
You don't want the same
So you better take my warning

I was angry, angry for a while
Started yelling, I had to push out the sound
You kept saying "She can not behave"
Stop complaining, 'cause I got no time to waste

Can I get it right back? Can I get it right back?
I'm calling out
Can I get it right back?
You don't even know what I wanted

Aye!
I am here to stay
Get out of my way, start running
Aye!
You don't want the same
So you better take my warning

I could be the change
I could shine a different light
I won't be the one
The one who'll teach you when they fight

Aye!
Eh, aye!
Aye!
Eh, aye!

I am here to stay
Get out of my way, start running
We don't want the same
So you better take my warning

Aye!
I am here to stay
Get out of my way, start running
Aye!
You don't want the same
So you better take my warning

I could be the change
I could shine a different light
I won't be the one
The one who'll teach you when they fight

I could be the change
I could shine a different light
I won't be the one
The one who'll teach you when they fight
