Time goes by, I fall out of touch
I can't explain why I fall so much
I bought a pack of cigarettes
Sent an old Elvis stamp to your new address

The weather's here, wish I was fine
Wish that you could read between the lines

'Cause you dream in colors
My night comes in black and blue
I'll send a postcard
Oh, how I wish that I were you
I wish I were you

'Cause I am nothing
You are more than flesh and blood, a golden door
Let me come inside of you
Let me do the things I wanna do

Now take me down to where you live
And take the things I cannot give

'Cause you dream in colors
My night comes in black and blue
I'll send a postcard
Oh, how I wish that I were you

'Cause you are like the ocean
I'm a river that's run dry
If you cannot reach me
All my wild flowers they will die, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now take me down to where you live
And take the things I cannot give, yeah, yeah, yeah

You dream in colors
My night it comes in black and blue
I'll send a postcard
Oh, how I wish that I were you
I wish I were you, yeah I wish I were you

Just wish I were you
Take me down to where you live
And take the things I cannot give
You can take me down to where you live
And take the things I cannot give
