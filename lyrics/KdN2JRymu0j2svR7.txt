I can't see through the stars in my eyes
And I don't recall breathing steady ever since you've been in my life
So let me catch my breath before you seal it once again
I should be dead by now

I swear it; and my heart, you know I'll wear it on my sleeve
For everyone to see that I am yours and you belong to me
And nothing in this world could ever make me this happy

So... don't fall asleep
I'm yours to keep
And from here on in
I'm giving it everything, 'cause

Nothing compares to what we share
I don't have a care in the world
'Cause even if it all came crashing down
As long as you're around
I'll be safe and sound

And I'm dying to know what it is that you're thinking
And I'm desperate to know why it is that I'm sinking
So deep beneath my sheets
And I'm struggling to find sleep, 'cause I've been

Retracing the steps that we took
And remembering the way that you'd hold me as I shook
In the rain, and I knew that I would never be the same

So... don't fall asleep
I'm yours to keep
And from here on in
I'm giving it everything, 'cause

Nothing compares to what we share
I don't have a care in the world
'Cause even if it all came crashing down
As long as you're around
I'll be safe

Yeah safe and sound
Safe and sound
You turned my life around
So far off the ground
Pick me up, I'm falling down

And it's all because of you
And I don't know what to do
I'm falling in
I think I'm falling in love with you
Because

Nothing compares to what we share
I don't have a care in the world
'Cause even if it all came crashing down
As long as you're around
I'll be safe and sound

Yeah I'll be
Yeah, yeah I'll be safe
Yeah I'll be safe
'Cause even if it all came crashing down
Down
'Cause even if it all came crashing down
Down
'Cause even if it all came crashing down
As long as you're around
I'll be safe and sound
