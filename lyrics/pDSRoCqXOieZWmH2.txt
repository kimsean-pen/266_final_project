Tickle me pink, I'm rosy as a flushed red apple skin
Except I've never been as sweet
I've rolled around the orchard and found myself too awkward
And tickle me green, I'm too naive

Pray for the people inside your head
For they won't be there when you're dead
Muffled out and pushed back down
Pushed back through the leafy ground

Time is too early, my hair isn't curly
I wish I was home and tucked away
When nothing goes right and the future's dark as night
What you need is a sunny, sunny day

Pray for the people inside your head
For they won't be there when you're dead
Muffled out and pushed back down
Pushed back through the leafy ground

Don't know where I can find myself a brand new pair of ears
Don't know where I can buy a heart
The one I've got is shoddy, I need a brand new body
And then I can have a brand new start

Pray for the people inside your head
For they won't be there when you're dead
Muffled out and pushed back down
Pushed back through the leafy ground

Monsters in the valley and shootings in the alley
And people fall flat at every turn
There is no straight and narrow, offload your wheelbarrow
And pick up your sticks and twigs to burn

Pray for the people inside your head
For they won't be there when you're dead
Muffled out and pushed back down
Pushed back through the leafy ground

Pray for the people inside your head
For they won't be there when you're dead
When you're dead, when you're dead
When you're dead, when you're dead
When you're dead, when you're dead
When you're dead, when you're dead, when you're
