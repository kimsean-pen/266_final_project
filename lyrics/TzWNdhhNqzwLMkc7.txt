Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High hopes)

Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had high, high hopes (High hopes)
Woo

Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had a, always had a feeling (Woo)
Always had a, always had a feeling
Al-Al-Al-had, always had a feeling (Woo)
Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

(Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had high, high hopes)
