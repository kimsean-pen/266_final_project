After the storm
Had passed
I wondered how long
The break in the clouds would last

I saw something in your eyes
I'm sure
Oh baby I saw it
Something in your eyes
I wanted it for myself

I sit and I wait
And I stare
Still wishing for a divine intervention
To lift me from my chair

I saw something in your eyes
I'm sure
Oh baby I saw it
Something in your eyes

I saw something in your eyes
I'm sure
Oh baby I saw it
Something in your eyes
I wanted it for myself

You and I we've come so far
We've reached beyond the farthest star
Time and time and time again
I want you back
You were my friend
We can pretend

I saw something in your eyes
I'm sure
Oh baby I saw it
Something in your eyes
I wanted it for myself
