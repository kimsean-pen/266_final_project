May I? May I?
Valves plugs pump to erase
Rictus from my face
Lapse of time
Synchro freeze
Loop rewind
Forward speed
Will to walk
Crossed out feet
Fingers fall
Far from reach
Mind to talk
Still words bleed
Optic box
Melted through
Sonic shock
Silent clue
Drop by drop
Drain-out tube

I hope, I need
I want to dream
Cold choke choke cold
I float unseen
Outside the screen
Cold choke choke cold
A wish, extreme
Against the stream
