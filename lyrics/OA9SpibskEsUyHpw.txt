Today, after staring into the sun
I saw the imprint of lips
Burned into the backs of mine
And in the flickering light
That found its way through the trees
And the passing scenery

From where I lay (Where I lay)
From where I lay (Where I lay)
From where I lay (Where I lay)
From where I lay

Today, I walked out beyond the cliffs
Breathing the "what if?" wind
And getting the hit of white grained spit
And when the flickering calmed
It made its way through the sea
To the bottom, to be emptied

From where I lay (Where I lay)
To where I've lain (Where I've lain)
Every day (Every day)
Is drifting away to a faraway place

(Where I lay)
(Where I lay)
(Every day)
