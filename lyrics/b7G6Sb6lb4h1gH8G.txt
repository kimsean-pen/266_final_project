You've been doing what you like
Thinking that you're always right
You can hold your breath,
'Cause I won't hold mine

You wouldn't care if it killed me
Misunderstood when you're guilty
Now you can bite your tongue
'Cause I won't bite mine

It's all so complicated
The way we're built to break it
I think it's overrated
I'm sick, I'm sick
I'm sick of the weight of the world

I'm so, so sick
I'm so, so sick

Now you think you've won this time
Thinking life was yours to buy
But you should wonder why
You can't sleep at night

You wouldn't care if it killed me
Misunderstood when you're guilty
Now you can bite your tongue
'Cause I won't bite mine, this time

It's all so complicated
The way we're built to break it
I think it's overrated
I'm sick, I'm sick
I'm sick of the weight of the world

Don't need your validation
Your drawn out dedication
I think it's overrated
I'm sick, I'm sick
I'm sick of the weight of the world

I'm so, so sick
I'm so, so sick
I'm so, so sick
I'm so sick

It's all so complicated
The way we're built to break it
I think it's overrated
I'm sick, I'm sick
I'm sick of the weight of the world

Don't need your validation
Your drawn out dedication
I think it's overrated
I'm sick, I'm sick
I'm sick of the weight of the world

I'm so, so sick
I'm so, so sick
I'm so, so sick
I'm so sick
