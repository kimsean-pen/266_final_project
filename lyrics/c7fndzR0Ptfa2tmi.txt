Understand, understand, understand, understand this
Ooh, and if you don't know, and if you don't know
Understand this, understand this, right now
Understand this, understand this, understand this

For too long I've been in the background
For too long I've been in the background, baby
It's time to step up to the front now
So you can hear me out
(So you can hear me out baby)

For too long I've been in the background
For too long I've been in the background, baby
It's time to step up to the front now
So you can hear me out yeah
(So you can hear me out)

Oh my god, I'm having the best time
Babe, me too, the music is amazing
Where's your drink?
Oh, sorry, it's here
Cheers!
Cheers!
Yas!
Wait, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
What?
Wait, wait

Oh my god, I love this song
Yay! Never forget you!
You will always be by my side
Hey, oh, it's Zara Larsson and M-Neck
Wait, who?
You know, M-Neck, M-M-M-Neck
MENK? M-Neck? M-Neck. I don't?
Hey babe, it's MNEK
What?
M-Neck sounds like an STD
Oh no wait, is that how you say it?
Babe, I love his music
Well then, girl, fucking say his name right
But that's how I thought you said it!
