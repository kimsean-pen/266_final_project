You think unkindly, simple not sane
Know what I mean?
Say I'm deliberately sent here to please
It's what you need, so I'm here tonight

You won't confuse me with somebody else
Look in your mirror, you're too good for yourself
It's all in your books, your magazines, can't you see?
I'll be headin' out in time, if it's wrong or right

I'll leave the morning after
I'll leave the morning after
Say I'm inviting to somebody else, know what I mean?
I know you'll always think one of my kind

You're on my mind, baby, all the time
Lift your skirt, lady, high in the night
I'm just what you need, won't you give it a try?
Don't put up a fight, it's gonna be alright, can't you see?
I'll be headin' out in time, if it's wrong or right

I'll leave the morning after
I'll leave the morning after
I'll leave the morning after
(Stay by my)

It's gonna be right, right out of the night
When out of the night, now, it's gonna be right
It's gonna be right, right out of the night
When out of the night, can't you see?

I'll leave the morning after
I'll leave the morning after
I'll leave the morning after
I'll leave the morning, morning, morning, morning, morning, on and on
I'll leave the morning after
I'll leave the morning after
