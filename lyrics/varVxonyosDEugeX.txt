Silence lays like lace around my mind
Delicate embrace I need sometimes

Guides me when I'm on my way back home
Tells me when I'm truly all alone

And when I get sick of the silence
I get back on the highway

Could be going nowhere
I can be going your way

Sick of the silence
But I'll be somewhere new by dawn

They could be
Better, better, better, better, better

Better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better
Oh, oh-oh-oh

And can you can recall that moment at all
When we warmed up way last June?

And how many times do we talk through the night
And sleep in way past noon?

But now I'm sick of the silence
Getting back on the highway

Could be going nowhere
I can be going your way

Sick of the silence
But I'll be somewhere new by dawn

They could be better
They could be better

Better, better, better, better, better
Better

Better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better

Be-be-be-be-be-better, better
Be-be-be-be-be-better, better

Better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better

Better, better, better, better, better
Be-be-be-be-be-better, better

Oh, oh-oh-oh
Better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better

Better, better, better, better, better
Be-be-be-be-be-better, better

Oh, oh-oh-oh
Better, better, better, better, better
