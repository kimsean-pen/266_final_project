How lovely is
Your dwelling place
O Lord almighty
My soul longs
And even faints
For you

For here my heart
Is satisfied
Within your presence
I see beneath
The shadows of
Your wings

Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Thousands elsewhere

One thing I ask
And I would seek
To see your beauty
To find you in
The place your glory dwells

Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

My heart and flesh cry out
To you, the living God
Your spirit's water for my soul
I've tasted and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will draw near to you
I will draw near to you

Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Thousands elsewhere
