Nobody sees, nobody knows
We are a secret, can't be exposed
That's how it is, that's how it goes
Far from the others, close to each other

In the daylight, in the daylight
When the sun is shinin'
On a late night, on a late night
When the moon is blindin'
In the plain sight, plain sight
Like stars in hidin'
You and I burn on, on

Put two and to-gether, forever we'll never change
Two and to-gether, we'll never change

Nobody sees, nobody knows
We are a secret, can't be exposed
That's how it is, that's how it goes
Far from the others, close to each other

That's when we uncover-cover-cover
That's when we uncover-cover-cover

My asylum, my asylum is in your arms
When the world gives heavy burdens
I can bear a thousand tons
On your shoulder, on your shoulder
I can reach an endless sky
Feels like paradise

Put two and to-gether, forever we'll never change
Two and to-gether, we'll never change

Nobody sees, nobody knows
We are a secret, can't be exposed
That's how it is, that's how it goes
Far from the others, close to each other

That's when we uncover-cover-cover
That's when we uncover-cover-cover

We could build a universe right here
All the world could disappear
Wouldn't notice, wouldn't care

We could build a universe right here
The world could disappear
Yeah, I just need you near

Nobody sees, nobody knows
We are a secret, can't be exposed
That's how it is (it is), that's how it goes (it goes)
Far from the others, close to each other

That's when we uncover-cover-cover
That's when we uncover-cover-cover (ooh, yeah)
That's when we uncover
