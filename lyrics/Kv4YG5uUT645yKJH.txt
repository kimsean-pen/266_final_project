You said, "There's a place for you up in the sky and next time we meet I know you'll be shining."
But the forces of gravity, uncertainty, self doubt, they pushed me back down to the ground right where I started.

Oh I wish the wind would just carry me
home, because I don't belong here no.

I Know there's a place for me out in this world but I got lost I'm just a girl. I'm fearful but learning.
And I don't want anyone to see me break cuz' I'm held together with string. And lately it's tearing.

And I wonder if I will ever be fine.
Yes, I wonder if I will ever smile again.

Oh I wish the wind would just carry me
home, because I don't belong here no.

Please Lift me, please lift me off of my heavy feet,
till this ground can't be seen, I'm so scared I could scream.
Scream out loud, scream out loud, but you could never tell,
lock it away so well, I don't belong here no.

Oh I wish the wind would just carry me
home, because I don't belong here no
