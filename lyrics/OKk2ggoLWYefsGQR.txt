With this ink in our skin, we've sealed our fate
And the axe comes early (Only naturally)
So what does that matter?
There's a bed of skeletons waiting for me
On the other side
They're waiting for my next move (next fatal breath)
Human lives to me seem so unreal, can't see through the fog
(Nothing past a grey wall)
See past the stereotype
Belief, structure built up in you
I'll tear you down and the one who created you

If they didn't have one how would they act?
If we didn't have hope how would we behave?
Would they still feel remorse if they slaughtered innocent beings
Or is hope the only thing that keeps you sane?

A good friend once told me you are memory
Without them we equal nothing
All I can see is the place I wanna be
Suddenly my life was so free

Leaves at my feet, blown to the ground
Their echoes are reaching my ears
Nights coming fast, suns going down
But keep away from me, keep away from me
It's hard to keep me in this place (keep away from me)
Keep away from me (keep away from me)
Keep away from me

We may have created the beginning, mentally
We may have created the beginning, physically
To the end of our human existence

I see through you
The fear that's in your eyes

A good friend once told me we are our memory
Without them we equal nothing
And all I can see is the place I wanna be
Timeless my life was so free
Leaves at my feet, blown to the ground
Their echoes are reaching my ears
Nights coming fast, suns going down, confused
I don't know the answers but neither do you
