Where do you draw the line?

Shape shifters, short term thinkers
Every single one wants to point the finger
No one wants to take the blame
Look into the mirror

You've done the same

From the machine to the street
What once had significance is now just pestilence
It lays dead at our feet
I don't live in your world of empty promises
I don't live in your world of zero consequence

You live to destroy the things I love
You live to feel the pain you've caused
Piling on then begging off
The champion of every worthless cause
Erode the structure of our culture
Just to move on
I don't care what you have to say
We are not the fucking same

This is real now motherfucker
And it's only your fault
Now this is real
