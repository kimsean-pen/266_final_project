Spirit walker

Spirit walker, Spirit walker
Too much living on the fringe
please come here
and sample my love.

Spirit walker, desonara (?)
shields her eye from the sun
truns from the wind
feeling the burn, from reaching within

NUrsing around feelings
Holding the llama's milk and (?)
Puring it thorugh the center
Can it be all around us
Coating us with the kind word
Words are alive with feelings
I am a lively spirit, I am a lively spirit...

Spirit walker, happy laugher
Trying hard to find it all
Sealing your fate
Fate will allow
Have faith in us all

Spirit walker, Spirit walker
Don't get me wrong
I'd follow you down
Just love me back
and i will respond
