Walked into the aisles of our lonely lives
Lift our idleness thinking will we die sometime
Who will sing and make our dreams wake up tonight
For a no no wasteland came into the light

I know that you're waiting for me
No, girl, this ain't make-believe
I know that you're waiting for me
No, girl, this ain't make-believe

Let me think a moment for the second time
Stay inside while I find past still very blind
Left me somewhere sitting patient still right mind
Brightness into always sun shines bright as skies

I know that you're waiting for me
No, girl, this ain't make-believe
I know that you're waiting for me
No, girl, this ain't make-believe

I know that you're waiting for me
No, girl, this ain't make-believe
I know that you're waiting for me
No, girl, this ain't make-believe
