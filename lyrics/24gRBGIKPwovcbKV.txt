I'm hiding behind, a thick haze of all my worries,
Feel broken inside
It's been days since I could think straight.
I used to feel so alive
Whatever happened to the rest of me
I use to think you were right
but you just tried to get the best of me

Been in haze for way to long
Now I'm disappearing
Can't find my way out of this fog
I can't see clearly
I want to be the one that I once knew
I want to see the world the way I use to
Before I ever let you get your way
I'm caught in a haze

I'm cutting the ties
Prepared to save the mind I'm losing
Counting your lies
I know what kind of life I'm choosing
I think I've finally arrived
I am exactly where I'm meant to be
I use to think you were right
but now my conscious isn't letting me

Been in haze for way to long
Now I'm disappearing
Can't find my way out of this fog
I can't see clearly
I want to be the one that I once knew
I want to see the world the way I use to
Before I ever let you get your way
I'm caught in a haze

Caught in a haze

I want to be the one that I once knew
I want to see the world the way I use to

Been in haze for way to long
Now I'm disappearing
Can't find my way out of this fog
I can't see clearly
I want to be the one that I once knew
I want to see the world the way I use to
Before I ever let you get your way
I'm caught in a haze
I'm caught in a haze
I'm caught in a haze
I'm caught in a haze
