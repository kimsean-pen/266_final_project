So I basically daydream
When I'm doing anything
I daydream when I walk
I daydream when I'm in class
I daydream when I dance

Next time around
I'll watch the words I say
Next time around
I'll bury my love
And hide it away
Next time around
I'll take it slow
And try holding it back

It's fun daydreaming, you know
You get to be whoever you want
And you get to do whatever you like
