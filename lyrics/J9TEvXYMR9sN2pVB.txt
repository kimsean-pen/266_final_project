Only fear what I fear I'll find
In an aimless answer
To a trusting mind
Asking if I'm wrong or right
With a mind so loud
That I fear I might be broken
Broken, I'm broken
In a colder shoulder
In a heated breath
In the past that shapes us
In the time that's left
It's a pale imitation
Of who you should have been
But it's all that's there now
And it makes me think I'm broken
Broken, I'm broken
In the way that you talk, in the words that you said
You're the shadow of doubt in the back of my head
You're the fire that burns like it's under my skin
You're the shame that I feel when I feel who I am
And I know who you are and I know who you were
It's as much in your silence as in every word
And I fucking despise that I care if you win
And I hate that I love when I feel like I'm broken
Broken, I'm broken
Broken, I'm broken
Broken, I'm broken
In all your rage, in all your own
I turn to stone, I turn to stone
In all your rage, in all your own
I turn to stone, I turn to stone
Broken (In all your rage, in all your own)
Broken
Broken (I turn to stone, I turn to stone)
Broken
Broken (In all your rage, in all your own)
Broken
I'm broken (I turn to stone, I turn to stone)
