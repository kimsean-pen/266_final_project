So hear me now
This weakened voicing
Listen one last time
It is dying
Here at the end I am
Watching closely
Afraid to see you
Afraid to be

So here it is again
This loneliness of mine
I can't seem to find you
I don't believe you're there
Is this your hand?
Is this the turning?
I need to say I lost you
I need to say goodbye

And save me from this blinding night
Of nothing
Save me from the dying
Save me from my god
Choose to find salvation in the sorrow
I hope to see you laughing
Laughing at the end

So here it is again
This loneliness of mine
I can't seem to find you
I don't believe you're there
Is this your hand?
Is this the turning?
I need to say I lost you
I need to say goodbye

I'm standing here in line
Hoping to see
My dreams are intertwined
I'm here by your side
So here it is with me
This old friend of mine
I'm trying to break free
I'm here by your side

So here it is again
This loneliness of mine
I can't seem to find you
I don't believe you're there
Is this your hand?
Is this the turning?
I need to say I lost you
I need to say goodbye
