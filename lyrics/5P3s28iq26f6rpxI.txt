What's a sunny day without you?
Just another twenty four that passes by
What's a sunny day without you?
Just another twenty four that passes by

As I sit upon the grass in the shade
I reminisce on what we had
The romance that we shared strolling through the park
Two people in love, walking hand in hand

But now that you're gone I feel so alone
All I do is think of you
Till the day you return
It doesn't mean a thing

What's a sunny day without you?

It's funny how you learn from your mistakes
Sometimes we take things for granted
But now that I have a change to make it right
I wanna give you, I wanna give you all my love

But now that your gone I feel so alone
All I do is think of you
Till the day you return
It doesn't mean a thing
