Ash his heart onto the ground
Pull his guts out by frustration
Be careful you might kill him.

Just 'cause he can't hear what you say
Doesn't mean that he's not listening.
If you listen to your words,
he might like what you say.

So you've been going out for years
And I'm sure that you've been happy
Happy with your role.

You've been looking up to him
As if you've forgotten of your own life,
Forgotten of your own face.
Burn and start again

Just 'cause he can't hear what you say
Doesn't mean that he's not listening
If you listen to your words
Then he might like what you say

On my own again
That's what she said
That's what she said
I'm leaving you tomorrow
But she already left
She already left

On my own again
Thats what she said
Thats what she said
I'm leaving you tomorrow
But she already left
She already left me

She said I'm better off dead
It's your own life
Live it for yourself
It's your own life
Live for your...

Just 'cause he can't hear what you say
Doesn't mean that he's not listening
If you listen to your words
Then he might like what you say

On my own again
That's what she said
That's what she said
I'm leaving you tomorrow
But she already left
She already left

On my own again
That's what she said
That's what she said
I'm leaving you tomorrow
But she already left
She already left me

She said I'm better off dead
