Isn't this nice?
My own worst enemy
taking control of things...
Now is the time
This is the melody
This is the symphony

Now hear my cry
There's no words beneath
There's no in between
There's no alibi to make this right
No behind the scenes
Everything you see
what you get don't fight

The world outside
is changing me
is changing me
to who I'm afraid of
I can't confide in anything
The crowd will not rest tonight

If you look twice
the second time you might fail to recognize
Look through my eyes
maybe a part of the
only is left inside

Now hear my cry
There's no words beneath
There's no in between
There's no alibi to make this right
No behind the scenes
Everything you see
what you get don't fight

The world outside
is changing me
is changing me
to who I'm afraid of
I can't confide in anything
The crowd will not rest tonight

The crowd will not rest tonight

Finally I can hold the key
The clock is still ticking
clock is still ticking
I can see
What does all this mean?
When the lock is still missing
Lock is still missing?

Finally I can hold the key
The clock is still ticking
clock is still ticking
I can see
What does all this mean?
When the lock is still missing?
The world outside
is changing me
is changing me
to who I'm afraid of
I can't confide in anything
The crowd will not rest tonight
