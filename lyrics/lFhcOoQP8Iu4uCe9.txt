He had a stroke at the age of 24
It could have been a brilliant career
Painting lines in a school that was too well known
Painting lines with a friend you had gone before

She challenged everyone to a fight
But the people all backed down
And they ran her out of town
'Cause she drank and swore and spoke
Out of turn, she was the village joke

She had a stroke at the age of 24
It could have been a brilliant career
Getting clients to finance her strategies
She's filling time in on Safeways on Saturday

She wears the clothes of an emperor
But her paintings are a sham
And they're going for a grand
When the dealers come to view
Do they ever see the real you?

He had a stroke at the age of 24
It could have been a brilliant career
Selling lies to the boys with the old Dansettes
Pulling the wool, playing the fool, it's no wonder that
He is dribbling spit tonight

And the one he sent away
Was the only one who stayed
With a spoon and a decent book
You can tell by the way she looks
She is sorry and resigned
As he wets himself for the final time
