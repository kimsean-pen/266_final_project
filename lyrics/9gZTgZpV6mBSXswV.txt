First one's a fool, who'll be the fool now
Who's gonna get in line
First one to go, first one to [?] the way
Let's go to moonlight, then that will never find
Let's go to home free from the mother mind
Come on along along along along along along

Jump on it
Jump on it
Jump on it
Hit me with a left
Hit me with they knock knock
Ht em with a play

Hit em with a knock knock
Hit em on the top
Hit em when they flock flock
Hit me with a shock
Then away and away and away and away

Hit em when they watch
Hit em with a dot dot dot dot dot dot
Then I'm up up up and away and away and away and away

Hit em when they watch
Hit em when they cop cop cop what you got
Then away and away and away and away and away and away

Jump on it
Jump on it on it
Jump on it
Jump on it

You want to be the teacher
Don't want to go to school
Don't want to do the dishes
Just want to eat the food

But what you gonna do when they saw all your moves and practiced em daily
Protect your neck or give invitations?
