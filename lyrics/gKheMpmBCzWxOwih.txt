You're in the dark
Just you and anger
Your oldest friend
Your closest lover
Show them your art
Show them your alchemy
Your addictive viral
Euphoric raging need

Kick down the door
Kick through the pain
You've been talking to the wall
Everybody is dead in this house

Kick down the door
Kick through the pain
You never wanted to be born
Everybody is dead in this house

You think too much
Mind over muscle
You keep seeing those dancing stars
They're all just idiots and whores
You cannot trust
The world's just trouble
Any chance you get â€“ destroy
Take everything back to the start

Kick down the door
Kick through the pain
You've been crawling up the wall
Everybody is dead in this house

Kick down the door
Kick through the pain
You never wanted to be born
Everybody is dead in this house
