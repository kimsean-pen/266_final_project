there is no castration fear
in a chair you will be with me
we'll dance [x4]
but no one will dance with us
in this zany town
chim-chim-chim, sing a song of praise
for your elders, they're in the back
pick out some brazilian nuts for your engagement
check that expiration date, man,
it's later than you think
you can't enjoy yourself, i can't enjoy myself [x2]
move that swing and
watch it break strafe like an arc
but i won't be there to leave you ah-ah-ah
'cause i don't have a clue anymore
maybe we could dance [x3] together
together
together
together
first time you'll see
and then you'll be
five times forever
and you'll never get lost
