Time won't change you, money won't change you
I haven't got the faintest idea
Everything seems to be up in the air at this point

I need something to change your mind
I need something to change your mind
I need something to change your mind
I need something to change your mind

Drugs won't change you, religion won't change you
I haven't got the faintest idea
Everything seems to be up in the air at this time

I need something to change your mind, mind
I need something to change your mind, mind
I need something to change your mind, mind
I need something to change your mind, mind

Science won't change you, looks like I can't change you
I try to talk to you to make things clear
But you're not even listening to me
And it comes directly from my heart to you

I need something to change your mind, mind
I need something to change your mind, mind
I need something to change your mind, mind
I need something to change your mind, yeah
