Now has come the day that I take the lead
And I make you follow
Toast of champagne 'cause I came for
Greed and not for tomorrow
If it feels good then it feels good and I do it all day
You want me to play you best bring your brain,
You best bring your money (Yeah!)

Make me a superstar (Yeah!)
No matter who you are.

Razor blade and lines and I walk
The line without feeling no one
Damn my throat is dry, I can't taste
The wine from these empty bottles
Films and magazines its all what
I need and all what I planned on
Where's my limousine
It's just like a dream that I won't wake up from (Yeah!)

Make me a superstar (Yeah!)
It don't matter who you are (Yeah!)
Make me a superstar (Yeah!)
No matter who you are.

And all of my pills and all of my drinks
Is makin' me, makin' me, makin' me
And all that I feel and all that
I see is makin' me, makin' me, makin' me

Cover me in greed, 'cause you planted
The seed when you fed my ego
Needless and disease for old
Invincible me like some kind of hero
Is it no surprise that I'm paralyzed
By my fame and fortune
As I close my eyes and dive
Into the sky I'm dead 27 (Yeah!)

Make me a superstar (Yeah!)
It don't matter who you are (Yeah!)
Make me a superstar (Yeah!)
No matter who you are.

And all of my pills and all of my drinks
Is makin' me, makin' me, makin' me
And all that I feel and all that
I see is makin' me, makin' me, makin' me

And all of my pills and all of my
Drinks is killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
And all that I feel and all that I see is
Fakin' me, fakin' me, fakin' me (Yeah!)

Make me a superstar, (Yeah!)
It don't matter who you are (Yeah!)
Make me a superstar, (Yeah!)
No matter who you are (Superstar)
