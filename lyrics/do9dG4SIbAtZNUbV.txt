Why'd you do babe
Why'd you do
Well your proof babe is untrue
Why'd you do babe
Why'd you do

Tell me once, tell me twice
I will hear you
We used to be long life
... for you
I can't stand by, live a lie with you
Cause there'll never be another one

Hear my song, hear my voice screamin' help me
I will be on the floor beggin' save me
I'm told remember this man looking for my hand...
But there'll never be another one, so

Why'd you do babe
Why'd you do
Well your proof babe is untrue
Why'd you do babe
Why'd you do
And there won't be another one

I might be,... tell me you want me
Ask you once, used to say do you love me
I could... for you, write for you, die for you
And there'll never be another one, so

Why'd you do babe
Why'd you do
Well your proof babe is untrue
Why'd you do babe
Why'd you do
And there won't be another one

Boy, I can feel your heart bursting through my chest
I can feel your lips running over my neck
Still I hear your lies, these words should not be said
One question I can't get out of my head

Why'd you do babe
Why'd you do
Well your proof babe is untrue
Why'd you do babe
Why'd you do
Well your proof babe is untrue
Why'd you do babe
Why'd you do
Well your proof babe is untrue
Why'd you do babe
Why'd you do
