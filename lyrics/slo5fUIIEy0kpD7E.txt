You were a silhouette
A shivering shadow in the mirror, ash and snow
I took your fevered hands
Felt like embers of the world's dying cloak
And you were phantom light as I carried you quietly through the crumbling streets
And in the fading light I could see in your eyes that somehow we were meant to meet
Would you stay with me?
If you thought the war was over
and everything made right
Would you still believe in us?
Would your love for me grow colder?
With no one left to fight
Would you stay with me?
Would you stay with me?
After the fever left
Together we scavenged through the city and the scars
When the day would end
Bar the door against the viewers and the dark
We'd share a can of something
and a bottle of bourbon I'd hid away
It warmed me from within
and you from without till I forget the chill ingrained
Would you stay with me?
If you thought the war was over
and everything made right
Would you still believe in us?
Would your love for me grow colder?
With no one left to fight
Would you stay with me?
Would you stay with me?
It seems like every night
I lie in bed and worry that the world would start to heal
And now I'm terrified
That if it did you'd start to ask if what we had is real
Would you stay with me?
If you thought the war was over
And everything made right
Would you still believe in us?
Would your love for me grow colder?
With no one left to fight
Would you stay with me?
Would you stay with me?
