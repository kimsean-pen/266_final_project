Lookin' out on the morning rain (Hohoo)
I used to feel so uninspired (Hohoo)
And when I knew I had to face another day (Hohoo)
Lord, it made me feel so tired

Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
And you're the key to my peace of mind

'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it

Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm livin' for
And if I make you happy, I don't need to do more

'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

Oh baby what you've done to me (what you done to me)
You make me feel so good inside (good inside)
And I just wanna be (wanna be)
Close to you, you make me feel so alive
You make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)
You make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)
You make me feel, you make me feel...
