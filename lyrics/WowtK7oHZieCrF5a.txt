There's a hundred love boats
All around me
And they all make the waves too high
There's a heavy burden
On my shoulders
And it slowly pulls me down

I just have no one to sail with me
I just have no one to sail with me

Would you sail away with me
Could you leave it all behind and float away
And to lie beside me
When the sun goes down
Would you take me as I am
I would hold you all the way I'd understand
We will break the strongest waves to see the land

There's some in the water
Close to drowning
And I'm always a stroke behind
The taken sailors
Don't realize
How they'd need to respect their wives

I just have no one to sail with me
I just have no one ...

Would you sail away with me
Could you leave it all behind and float away
And to lie beside me
When the sun goes down
Would you take me as I am
I would hold you all the way I'd understand
We will break the strongest waves to see the land

Would you sail away with me
Could you leave it all behind and float away
And to lie beside me
When the sun goes down
Would you take me as I am
I would hold you all the way I'd understand
We will break the strongest waves to see the land

The wind is calm
The ocean sleeps
We must leave now
The sky is dark
Others are gone
We must leave now

The wind is calm
The ocean sleeps
We must leave now
The sky is dark
Others are gone
We must leave now

Would you sail away with me
Could you leave it all behind and float away
And to lie beside me
When the sun goes down
Would you take me as I am
I would hold you all the way I'd understand
We will break the strongest waves to see the land

Would you sail away with me
Could you leave it all behind and float away
And to lie beside me
When the sun goes down
Would you take me as I am
I would hold you all the way I'd understand
We will break the strongest waves to see the land
