I'll love you, if you ain't got nobody to love
And girl I'll adore you, if there's no one to adore
And I'll show you, if there's no one to show
And I'll know you, if you want somebody to know

Every time you come around
You put a lightning bolt on my face
Baby, everytime you come around
Girl, you take my breath away

And I just wanna breathe until I take you in
'Cause I want you to breathe until you take me in
But the truth is

She has no idea, no idea
That I'm even here, I'm even here
She has no idea, no idea
I'm standing here, I'm standing here
I'm standing here

I'll kiss you, whenever you want to be kissed
How I miss you two seconds after you leave
Screaming come back to me, come back to me

Let me please you, let me see you
Let me take that heart of yours
And I'll be whatever you need me to be
The good guy, bad guy, just tell me baby

Every time you come around
You put a lightning bolt on my face
Baby, everytime you come around
Girl, you take my breath away

And I just wanna breathe until I take you in
'Cause I want you to breathe until you take me in
But the truth is

She has no idea, no idea
That I'm even here, I'm even here
She has no idea, no idea
I'm standing here, I'm standing here
I'm standing here

Please tell me you can heal me
I'm expressing my love
Won't stop till I get you
I'm not letting up
I'm running to your heart
Like a kid in a store
Take every ounce of love
And beg you for more
And beg you for more

She has no idea, no idea
That I'm even here, I'm even here
She has no idea, no idea
I'm standing here, I'm standing here
I'm standing here
