I'm a recovering undercover over-lover
Recovering from a love I can't get over
Recovering undercover over-lover
And now my common law lover thinks he wants another

And I'd lie for you
I'd cry for you
And pop for you
And break for you
And hate for you
And I'll hate you too
If you want me too
Ah, Uuu...
I'd pray for you
Crochet for you
Make it from scratch for you
Leave out the last for you
Go to the store for you
Do it some more for you
Do what you want me to
Yes I'm a fool for you...

I'm a recovering undercover over-lover
Recovering from a love I can't get over
(I) recovering undercover over-lover
And now my common law lover thinks he wants another

And I'd lie for you
And cry for you
And pop for you
And break for you
And hate for you
And I'll hate you too
If you want me too
I gotta do my love for you
Chopped and screwed for you
Pay the rent for you
It's true it's true
Poor Badu
Thought I was through with you
Guess I'm a fool for you...

Could this be
Love from high
New frontier
Whose this guy
Your so wise
I'm so good
Like summertime
You'd had it all
Build a wall
Ten feet tall
Now I laugh at it all
Out my mind
Just in time
Never knew...
I was blind
What it through
I can't see there
Mama say
Let there be
Easily
Said and done
I can't feel
I am numb
Bitter dream
Fruit so raw
Winter cold
Let me out
I know you
Do you hear me

Out my mind,
Just in time

Oho I...
Oho I...
Oho I...
Oho I...
Yeah
Man...
This This
I'm so addicted
I can't quit
Oh
I follow this, Yeah.
It's time for me to make some steps
Easy to blame somebody else
But not this time

No

But not this
No
But not this time...
But not this time

No
But not this time...
But not this time
But not this
No
20 feet out of ashes I can rise
Just like birds and children
I can fly
And I'll take my phoenix flight
And you can't take mine
but you can try, ah no
But not this time
But not this time
But not this time
But not this
No
But not this time
But not this time

Hey
On and on
I seem to go
Round and round I seem to go
Always had the antidote
Looking for the Holy Ghost
Found him in the missing note
Sinking in a holy boat
Round and round
I seem to go
Round and round...(round)...and round
Oho I ...
Oho I...
Oho I...
Yeah,
Guess it's time to grab a coat
Evolution time to grow
Ego trying to block the door
Might not have nowhere to go
I finally got a leading role
Introducing super dope
Staring in her episode
Hello, new world
Out my mind.
