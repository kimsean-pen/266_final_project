Purple-brown skylit streetlight
Walking home, there ain't a trace of moonlight
You hold out your hand and everything is so easy
And I think that's the part that scares me
Do you feel the same?
I've been searching within
Looking for the point where you end and the place where I begin
It's taking so long now, babe

Well, we bathe in the living room lamplight
Casting shadows on the walls that have heard these sighs before
I don't know if it's over
I guess the years just made us older
And I can't imagine life without you
How, I built my world around you!
We've been together so long now, babe

I'm seeing spirals
I'm moving with you again

Heavy ever-circling dawnlight
We've been talking so long that we lost just who we are
Like we're looking for answers
Come on and make my heart a dancer
I wanna hear not another word spoken
Let's get lost inside this moment
And I won't take no for an answer now

I'm seeing spirals
I'm moving with you again
