You wandered through the willows, in the forest you were found
Trying to hide your footprints in the ground
It's not so wise, if you try to run
It's not so wise, you know I've won, you know I've won
And you'll smile, on your knees
The Hunter becomes... the hunter becomes the hunted
The Hunter becomes the hunted...

The Hunter becomes the hunted...
The Hunter becomes the hunted...
The Hunter becomes the hunted...
The Hunter becomes the hunted...
The Hunter becomes the hunted...
The Hunter becomes the hunted...
