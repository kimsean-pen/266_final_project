Baby, I'll wait
Love, it's never too late to save this
Take them downtown, go round, and rest assured
I'm hanging from your lips, dancing in your stillness
While you're killing this,
but only say the words and I'll be yours
'Cause darling if you call me,
I'll come running
(Try and stop me)
Turn out all the lights
In the dead of night
'Cause I, I, I'm your love
I'm ready for my turn to be your one and
Your only
Ready for your eyes
Sweet on the inside
By your summertime, like cherry
Like cherry
Baby, I'll keep my hands where you can see them
Finally got me up against the wall
All my friends say:
"Stop wasting your days on a runaway,
Nevermind the time it took to fall"
'Cause darling if you call me,
I'll come running
(Try and stop me)
Turn out all the lights
In the dead of night
'Cause I, I, I'm your love
I'm ready for my turn to be your one and
Your only
Ready for your eyes
Sweet on the inside
By your summertime, like cherry
Like cherry
Like cherry
Red lips, soft skin
Sit me on your shoulders
Swing me round your hips
Gold hair, cold stare
I'll be your July
and I can take you there
'Cause darling if you call me,
I'll come running
(Try and stop me)
Turn out all the lights
In the dead of night
'Cause I, I, I'm your love
I'm ready for my turn to be your one and
Your only
Ready for your eyes
Sweet on the inside
By your summertime, like cherry
Like cherry
Like cherry
Like cherry
Like cherry
