I believe in littering
Waste should not be hidden, but seen I believe in stealing
For we cannot possess anything
I will be good when I'm gone
I'm going West where I belong
I waited all summer long
Don't it sound funny? Don't it sound strange? I'm going to make my home out on the range
I believe in junk food
In solidarity with the poor and screwed I believe in the Great Spirit
When you sing, I want to hear it
I will be good when I'm gone
I'm going West where I belong
I waited all summer long
Though it might sound strange
I'm going to make my home out on the range
I will, I'm gone
My whole life for a song
I'm going where I belong
Some people never change
I'll make my home out on the range
