I fell asleep
I-I fell asleep

I fell asleep,
but in my dream i was awake and you were there flying through the air
You told me a lie
about blue light
a glitter? in your eyes
And you dove into the ocean and never came up

Because I was awake I wept
after, your face appeared in a cloud
I put a photo of the cloud online
and I smiled and I knew it was a dream
When I shook myself out,
my body was soaked a thousand times
over sweat and tears and strangers________

Sure, everything's fine
was I kicking at the night?
look at me the colds and the fire
we could sweat it up, any dream to the sink
where I'm running away from the terror out of breath
white eyed looking for a place to hide
Cause you lead me astray,
run your fingers through my hair and
tell me everything is fine until i'm

DEAD!
give me mouth to mouth again
I'M DEAD give me mouth to mouth again

I fell sleep

Congratulations

You never give up

That's because I'm in love with you

We'll do it again?
Yes! Yes!
Where is everybody?
Was it only a dream?
(Sure, everything is fine)

Sure, everything is fine

WHY?
Why am i always running for my life?
Being chased by faceless mobs through the night
Can we fuck it up?
Some cheap motel
We worth that, we can put it all night
With a tight red dress, anything to keep my mind
Off a (you?) falling forever why can't I say this
out loud oh no, yes everything is fine untill I'm

DEAD!
Give me mouth to mouth again
I'm dead, give me mouth to mouth again
