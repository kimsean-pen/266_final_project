This year's love had better last
Heaven knows it's high time
I've been waiting on my own
Too long
And when ya hold me like you do
It feels so right, oh now
I start to forget
How my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feelin' like ya can't go on

Turnin' circles and time again
Cut like a knife, oh now
If ya love me, got to know for sure
'Cause it takes something more this time
Than sweet, sweet lies, oh now
Before I open up my arms and fall
Losing all control
Every dream inside my soul

When ya kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singin' ain't this life so sweet

This year's love had better last
This year's love had better last

'Cause who's to worry
If our hearts get torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Don't ya know this life goes on

Won't ya kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singin' ain't this life so sweet

This year's love had better last
This year's love had better last
This year's love had better last
This year's love had better last
This year's love had better last
Wohohoho ahah yeah
This year's love had better last
