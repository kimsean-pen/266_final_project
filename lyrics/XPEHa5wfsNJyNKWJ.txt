I've never been the social type
But I talk to myself every night
A million voices in my head
Scream out the things I should've said

Yeah, yeah
Cause I'm walking awkward
Yeah, yeah
But that's obvious
Yeah, yeah
And we get to talking
Yeah, yeah

But I would just bite my tongue

I can tell you so much
But we both heard enough
You said I'm making you blush
I bite my tongue
Like a devilish curse
That you put on my words
But I love that it hurts
Whenever you bite my tongue

Bite my tongue

I've played out this scenario
So many times it's getting old
Just put my weary mouth to rest
So we can talk a little less

Yeah, yeah
Cause I'm walking awkward
Yeah, yeah
But that's obvious
Yeah, yeah
And we get to talking
Yeah, yeah
But I would just bite my tongue

I can tell you so much
But we both heard enough
You said I'm making you blush
I bite my tongue
Like a devilish curse
That you put on my words
But I love that it hurts
Whenever you bite my tongue

Bite my tongue

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

But I would just bite my tongue
I can tell you so much
But we both heard enough
You said I'm making you blush
I bite my tongue
Like a devilish curse
That you put on my words
But I love that it hurts
Whenever you bite my tongue
Bite my tongue
