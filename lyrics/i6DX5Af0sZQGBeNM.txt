desperately wanting a life without me
night calls she falls for sins like an animal
who can i trust anymore?
the woman i love falls for another
my heaven falls apart
secretly praying you don't find love
given the time
the woman i love falls for another
my heaven falls apart
secretly praying you don't find love
given the time
i'll find you
