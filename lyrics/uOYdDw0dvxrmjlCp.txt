Now is the end of time a fool and his legacy are gone
His pride found another way to make sure it all went wrong
Awake in a new day our fears have come to pass
And this time they're gonna last. This time they're gonna last.

Don't let me drown! Don't let me drown!

Now all of the fields are burning it blocks out the sun
I see all the water rising to drown everyone

This is the season we tear our rivals down
This circle of tyrants will end us all right now
The earth has provided the means to burn it down
Well don't you see it now? Well don't you see it now?

Don't let me drown! Don't let me drown!

Now all of the fields are burning it blocks out the sun
I see all the water rising to drown everyone
This is tomorrow's way to end our days
Watch as the clouds they gather now to wash us away

Water is rising coming to wash it all way
There's no denying we were so wrong
Water is rising coming to wash the filth away
There's no denying we are so lost

Staring down the end of time every fear is realized
Crying out it's much too late there's nothing we can do to save
For the time has come
Watch as the clouds, they gather now
To wash us away
At the end of days
The end of days
