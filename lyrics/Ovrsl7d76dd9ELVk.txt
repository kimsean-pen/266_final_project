It's not hard to play the victim, ooh
When these scars belong to you
I'm a walking contradiction
To practice what I preach
Would be a heavy load to bare

Novelty you and I
Have been unfamiliar
And I don't know when
But I can't believe we've run dry
I let you steal my thunder
No reprieve for my mind

Paralyzed, paralyzed
I'm caught in the middle of voices
Pulling me far from where I'm able
To stand in the light and walk without you
I'm paralyzed, paralyzed
I'm caught in the middle of choices
Pushing me far from where I'm stable, capsized
Paralyzed

Oooh, oooh

Venture into dreams we hope for
But live in fear of truths we hide
To let them show would leave me open
And I could not conceive a harder load to share

Novelty, you and I
Have been unfamiliar
And I don't know when
But I can't believe we've run dry
I let you steal my thunder
No reprieve for my mind

I'm paralyzed, paralyzed
I'm caught in the middle of voices
Pulling me far from where I'm able
To stand in the light and walk without you
I'm paralyzed, paralyzed
I'm caught in the middle of choices
Pushing me far from where I'm stable, capsized

Fallen like darkness at night
Feel it cloud over my eyes

You and I
Have been unfamiliar
And I don't know when

I'm paralyzed, paralyzed
I'm caught in the middle of voices
Pulling me far from where I'm able
To stand in the light and walk without you
I'm paralyzed, paralyzed
I'm caught in the middle of choices
Pushing me far from where I'm stable, capsized
Paralyzed
