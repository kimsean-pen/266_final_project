Came in from the city
wakled into the door
I turned around when I heard
The sound of footsteps on the floor.
Love just like addiction now I'm hooked on you
I need some time to get it right
Your love gonna see me through.
Can't stop now
don't you know
I ain't never gonna let you go, don't go!

Don't go
don't go

Baby
make your mind up
give me what you got
Fix me with your lovin shut the door and turn the lock.
Hey

doctor came too late
Another night I feel alright my love for you can't wait.
Can't stop now
don't you know
I ain't never gonna let you go, don't go!

Can't stop now
don't you know
I ain't never gonna let you go, don't go!

Don't go
don't go

Came in from the city
walked into the door
I turned around when I heard
The sound of footsteps on the floor.
Said he was a killer
now I know it's true
I'm dead when you walk out the door

Can't stop now
don't you know
I ain't never gonna let you go, don't go!

Don't go
don't go

Oh, don't go
