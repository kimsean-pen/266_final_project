Shadows of time are coming
Shadows of time arise from the corners of my mind
Over and over watching
Over and over searching for those hearts that are blind

In the night, hiding in the night
Laying here by your side, lying about the lie
Fighting with myself, hiding from myself
Running to your arms, dying in your arms
Coming back to life

Knocking at doors and windows, hiding in silky pillows
They're coming through the years
You should just hold me tightly, you should be close and quietly
Protect me from my fears

In the night, hiding in the night
Laying here by your side, lying about the lie
Fighting with myself, hiding from myself
Running to your arms, dying in your arms
Coming back to life
