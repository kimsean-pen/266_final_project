You lead them, livin in a doubt (?)
But thinking, thinking if you smart.
I dont need you, i dont have to plead you.
You know my name, will i feel the same,
Im so grooving(?) now, and i dont care!
You know the rules,
Im not a fool,
If you think i am,
Will i feel the same.
Im so grooving(?) now, and i dont care.
I DONT CARE, I DONT CARE, I DONT CARE!
I just dont care!
Im figured out, im just gonna do what i feel, i do it. i dont care, i just dont care.
