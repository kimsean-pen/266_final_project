I don't know what you're after
Wanna know all the details of my disaster
Like an accident on the side of the road
And you're driving past slow but there's nothing to see here

Wanna take a look, take a look
Wanna take a look, take a look
Wanna take a look, take a look
Wanna take a look, take a look

I'm some kind of freak now and you'll never see me the same
What's all the fuss about? Are you sure you wanna find out?
'Cause once you know the truth you might wish you'd walked away

Wanna take a look, take a look
Wanna take a look, take a look
Wanna take a look, take a look
Wanna take a look, take a look

What if I'm not able
To put my cards on the table?
And would it liberate you
If you knew what I knew?

It's been over a year now
And I never saw him again
The facts and the fiction
Collide as the bodies untangle
And the traffic moves on like it did

Wanna take a look, take a look
Wanna take a look, take a look
Wanna take a look, take a look
Wanna take a look, take a look

Wanna take a look, take a look
Wanna take a look, take a look
Wanna take a look, take a look
Wanna take a look, take a look
