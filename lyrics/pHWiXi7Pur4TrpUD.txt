Rattling our cages now, coming on like thunder
This marigold run
So far away, I won't be coming back
Just a little too much
Just thought that they would find me
Dig me out
Spiders and flies coming up inside
I'm rebirthing

And we all rise
From the shadows, from the slumber, sun rise
Each and everyone
It's gonna be alright if we stick together for all time

This is a good time, I've heard about my life
Deepest of dreams ahead
Just a little too much
Just thought that they would find me
Dig me out
Alright, I'm having a good time
Here's to the long run
Slowly falling out of mind into heaven

And we all rise
From the shadows, from the slumber, sun rise
Each and everyone
It's gonna be alright if we stick together for all time
And we all rise
From the shadows, from the slumber, sun rise
Each and everyone
It's gonna be alright if we stick together for all time

It's you and me together right now, now, oh yeah
It's you and me together right now, now
Hey, they, they have a new guest
I'm feeling best of the best
The movements part of the land together

And we all rise
From the shadows, from the slumber, sun rise
Each and everyone
It's gonna be alright if we stick together for all time
And we all rise
From the shadows, from the slumber, sun rise
Each and everyone
It's gonna be alright if we stick together for all time
And we all rise
From the shadows, from the slumber, sun rise
Each and everyone
It's gonna be alright if we stick together for all time
