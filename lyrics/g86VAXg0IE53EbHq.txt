I had a dream
Just like Mr. King
You were there too
Dressed only in blue
Go

And I love the way you love
To take such comfort in yourself
And I hate the way you hate
To take no tears about your health
Well I'd like to pick you up
But I would rather watch you crawl
Well I'd love to pick you up
But I would rather watch you fall
Go
