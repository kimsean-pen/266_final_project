Reputations made
I failed to save
The cold I seek is all I'll feel
Today I'm selling mine after all
Watch it all fade away to gray
I sold it to rule the world
If only I could rescue you
Cleaning up the mess we've made
It's not the same without your love

Do you care at all?
I don't see a difference
Is this love at all?

We stayed so close in this life at one time
Now I watch as you fade away
Behind the wall of hate inside your mind
Will we meet again?
I'll be waiting beyond the edge
Forever frozen
Now time stops again
Revelation

I've found that it's all gone
The absence within us grows
Illuminate the way we choose to flow

Do you care at all?
I don't see a difference
Is this a love at all?

I hold one last feeling of hope
Our paths will meet again
Beyond the edge
Forever frozen
Time stops now
