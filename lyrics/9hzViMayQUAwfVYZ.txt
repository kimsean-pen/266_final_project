Weaving a web
of lies and deceit

It's a dangerous game
we play...
All this time!

the pain eating us away

All this time!
the memories refuse to fade

A rotting shell
of dying trust

We share this hell
at any cost

Phases and stages
Circles and cycles
And empty charade
This pointless

masquerade
A dangerous game!
A dangerous game!
we play...
Web of lies
I can see it
in your eyes!
Web of lies
You can see it
in my eyes!
It will never be the same
We have gone too far this time
Our temple of false dreams
Comes crashing down...
A rotting shell
of dying trust
We shared this hell
at any cost
Phases and stages
Circles and cycles
And empty charade
This pointless
masquerade
A dangerous game!
A dangerous game!
we play...
Web of lies
I can see it
in your eyes...
Web of lies
You can see it
in my eyes...
You can see it... see it...
see it in my eyes
(solo)
Web of lies
I can see it
in your eyes!
Web of lies
You can see it...
in... my... eyes!
