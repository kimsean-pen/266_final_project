We are one thirty-eight, we are one thirty-eight, we are one thirty-eight
We are one thirty-eight, we are one thirty-eight, we are one thirty-eight
We are one thirty-eight, we are one thirty-eight, in the eyes of tiger

Do you think we're robot clean
Does this face look almost mean
Is it time to be an android not a man

The pleasantries are gone
We're stripped of all we were
In the eyes of tiger

We are one thirty-eight, we are one thirty-eight, we are one thirty-eight
We are one thirty-eight, we are one thirty-eight, we are one thirty-eight
Eight
