I had a feeling you broke and the smoke filled you up
I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you
You have a mind on excite of the weight you pick up
I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you

Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you
I wasn't, I wasn't
Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you
I wasn't, I wasn't

There is a color that shines through your skin
Like the moon on the wind, [?] you in
The night is full on the height of your evaded minds
And the rings vandalize

We are stranger than Earth with the seasons misled
Stronger than the moons
When I [?] she bled and bled and bled
I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you

Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you
I wasn't, I wasn't
Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you
I wasn't, I wasn't

There is no lesson in magic
There were untimely dreams where I knew
Lookin' in a fog, don't sweat it
And reckon none of it had come from you
There is no lesson in magic
There were untimely dreams where I knew
Lookin' in a fog, don't sweat it
And reckon none of it had come from you

Pity seek what we might lose
But in a week might our weakness elude

There was a stagger that shifted my hips
Oh how swiftly it shook the dew from my lips
There was a danger that seeped from my skull
How it dripped on us all but it wasn't your fault

We are stranger than Earth with the seasons misled
Stronger than the moons
When I [?] she bled and bled and bled
I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you

Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you
I wasn't, I wasn't
Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you
I wasn't, I wasn't

And we break downstairs with our fevers in the air
I forgot to ask how I only left them there
How thick it sets and why your eyes glare
How thick it sets and why your eyes glare
