Eh-eh-ahem, special announcement, rich bitches don't die
And that's why you won't survive the summer
Amen

Uh, she's salty, I sauté the bitch
Alaïa jacket and I slay the bitch
Big body on display and shit
This is just another day and shit
Was down for love, I got played and shit
Cameras flashing, downplay the dick
I would never ever claim your dick
In interviews, I'm like, "Who is this?"
Bitches tryna put an end to me
Producers still sending beats
I send it back in like a day or so
You bitches writin' slow like centipedes
My crib got amenities
I just bought a T-Rex tooth 'cause I'm tryna stunt on Mr. Flintstone
One look and your bitch gone
Turned a T-Rex tooth to a chain, shit cost more than your Range
I'm a diamond in the rough, fancy diamonds by the way
I been making moves, been writing rhymes, been stacking commas
But you? Hold up, bitch, can you survive the summer?

Woah, uh
You won't survive the summer, look, yeah, uh
You won't survive the summer, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't stay alive much longer, look, look
You won't survive the summer

Ummm, I just wanna get in my Ferrari and
Drive real slow, so everyone can see my face

I know you bitches gon' hate this shit
Get the fuck up out my way and shit
Give 'em hell 365
You would think I'm 'bout to bake a bitch
Summer's over, it's a cold front
Tryna stop me is a witch hunt
Lemme' drop a lil' wisdom
Crack kills, you a victim
You a victim, you a victim
If I don't like it then I switch (uh)
Label tripping so I switch (uh)
Which one? Which one?
Bring the bag and it's done

Woah, uh
You won't survive the summer, look, yeah, uh
You won't survive the summer, yeah, yeah, uh
Can't stay alive much longer, look, look
You won't survive the summer!

You're a victim

Hold up bitch (hold up bitch), I think you're moving too fast (fast)
Money spent (money spent), ain't even counted the cash (cash)
Hold up bitch (hold up bitch), I think you're moving too fast (fast)
Money spent (money spent), ain't even counted the cash (cash)
Trust me it ain't gonna last, it ain't gonna last, it ain't gonna last
You're 'bout to fall on your ass

Look, you won't survive the summer
You won't survive the summer, damn, uh
They ain't getting dumber and dumber (Dumber and
Dumber and dumber and dumber and dumber and dumber)
Shit, you won't survive the summer!

I know these Chanel shoes are ugly, but
That's your rent, bitch
