Afterlife, so comforting to live in life forever
Glory to the one you choose, the ghost you call a friend

Stone me to sleep
No soul to keep

I don't go for no holy books
Those ancient rhymes, they ain't got no hooks
I don't go for no holy books
Those ancient rhymes, they ain't got no hooks

The longer chariness is creeping in the claw
Cover up your verged sluts temptation, never rust

Stone me to sleep
No soul to keep
Don't wander beneath
Like fog release

I don't go for no holy books
Those ancient rhymes, they ain't got no hooks
I don't go for no holy books
Those ancient rhymes, they ain't got no hooks
I don't go for no holy books
Those ancient rhymes, they ain't got no hooks
I don't go for no holy books
Those ancient rhymes, they ain't got no hooks
