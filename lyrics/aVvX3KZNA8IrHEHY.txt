In the distance, light years from tomorrow
far beyond yesterday
she is watching heart aching with sorrow
she is broken as she waits
hoping when all is said and done
we learn to love and be as one
Oh Starlight
don't you cry we're gonna make it right
before tomorrow
Oh Starlight
don't you cry we're gonna find a place
where we belong
where we belong
and so you know
you'll never shine alone
There are shadows sleepin' on the horizon
that leave us scared and so afraid
of the fallout of a world divided
that brings us tears and so much pain
so we take cover from the dark
hoping to find where we can start
Oh Starlight
don't you cry we're gonna make it right
before tomorrow
Oh Starlight
don't you cry we're gonna find a place
where we belong
where we belong
and so you know
you'll never shine alone
Starlight we'll find a place where we belong
where we belong
You will see as mountains crumble
and turn to dust
there is one thing that one change
cause I believe there is something within each of us
that always stays
and will always remain
as long as love never fails
Oh Starlight
don't you cry we're gonna make it right
before tomorrow
Oh Starlight
don't you cry we're gonna find a place
where we belong
where we belong
and so you know
you'll never shine alone
Starlight, we'll find a place where we belong
where we belong
She is watching
heartaching with sorrow
she is broken
as she waits
