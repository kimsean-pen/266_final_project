I've got a problem
I don't know what to do
I can only love her if she lets me love you too
I'm trying hard to show her
What a man like me could do
If only I could show her
All the things I want to

I've got a problem
I don't know what to do
I think I'm really like you
I hope you're really like me too
What else can I say girl
I miss you all the time
A promise is forever
So I'll keep yours on my mind

You looked at me so curiously I never asked you why
I hope that you don't think that I am trying to decide
It tears me up, it puts me out head spinning again again
We fall in love and fall apart again

So here we are and yes it's a little bit
Too built up and no I aint feeling this
Can't you see that this trouble
142 yes this could be trouble
Here we are and yes I'm a little bit
Too worked up inside to be feeling this
Can't you see that this is trouble
142 yeah this is trouble
