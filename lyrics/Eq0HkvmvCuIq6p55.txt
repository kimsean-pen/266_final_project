When she walked in, with her painted lips
Did she tease you for your flirty quips?
Did she leave you frozen with the wrong words chosen?
You gotta show her why she can't resist
Make her blush when you put your hand on her hips
She's gonna keep on playing until you stop chasing

So wrap your arms around her body
Tell her all she needs to know
Give a little heart and soul
Let your body lose control
Give a little oh, oh, ooh
Give a little
Wrap your arms around and give a little!

You gotta show her, when she can't decide
You gotta hold her, with that look in your eyes
When you move in close, take your time
Leave an empty shoulder, let her move in closer

And wrap your arms around her body
Tell her all she needs to know
Give a little heart and soul
Let your body lose control
Give a little oh, oh, ooh
Give a little
Wrap your arms around and give a little!

She loves to keep you in suspense
You know she loves to keep you in suspense
But you know she just wants to dance

Give a little heart and soul
Let her body lose control
Give a little oh, oh, ooh
Just give a little
Wrap your arms around and give a little!

Wrap your arms around and give a little!
Now you wanna hold her!
