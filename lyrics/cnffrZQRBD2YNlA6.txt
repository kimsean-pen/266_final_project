All the way from where we came
We built a mansion in a day
Distant lightning, thunder claps
Watched our neighbors house collapse
Looked the other way

And then the storm was overhead
All the ocean's boil and river's bled
We auctioned off our memories in the absence of a breeze
Scatter what remains, scatter what remains

Pushed away and I'm pulled toward
A come down of revolving doors
Every warning we ignored
Drifting in from distant shores
The wind presents a change of course, a second reckoning of sorts
We were wasted waiting for a come down of revolving doors

Fate don't fail me now

And when the days that followed past
In another mansion built to last
From our window we could see
Only possibilities down the road and back

But, then the storm returned for more
In a come down of revolving doors
Auction off our memories in the absence of a breeze
Scatter what remains, scatter what remains

Pushed away and I'm pulled toward
A come down of revolving doors
Every warning we ignored
Drifting in from distant shores
The wind presents a change of course, a second reckoning of sorts
We were wasted waiting for a come down of revolving doors

Fate don't fail me now
Fate don't fail me now
Fate don't fail me now
Fate don't fail me now
