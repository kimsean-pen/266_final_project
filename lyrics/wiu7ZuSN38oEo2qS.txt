Calling from a distance
I hear your voice again
All the signs are pointing to
What I don't understand

Are you now the kiss of life hiding in the dark
Cause every time I've reached alone
Feels like I'm missing every mark

I'll take a chance tonight
Another roll of the dice
I can't lose with you...

High... But you're falling like the rain
Blinded by illusion, but you do it all over again
High... You know it's just a game
Not looking for forever
Just a chance to start again

They say I'm out of action
Losing all control
I'm keeping count of every move
In a city I call home
You never gave a warning
Like an arrow tears the sky
Bring me to my senses cause tomorrows open wide

I feel more alive than I ever did in time
I can't lose with you

High... But you're falling like the rain
Blinded by illusion, but you do it all over again
High... You know it's just a game
Not looking for forever
I just wanna start over again
