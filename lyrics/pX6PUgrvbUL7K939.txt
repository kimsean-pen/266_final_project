It's all too much to take in now
You're much too lateâ€”your petty fate in pieces on the ground
Blame all your faults and failures on your own human nature
Speak now or forever hold your pride

You think you're not just another, but you're no better than the others
Rumor has a way of seeing through the end of anything
Truth will find a way of seeing through the end of anything

Who would've thought that anyone could be so vain?
But it's the little things you do that go and give yourself away
You're onto something new, another breakthrough
You think this could be the one
But that'll never be
No, it's not hard to see
Your own hands will bring you to your knees

You wanted more than you could afford

You think you're not just another, but you're no better than the others
Rumor has a way of seeing through the end of anything
Truth will find a way of seeing through the end of anything

Tell me something
How does it feel to be the only thing that keeps your dreams from being real?
It's a fallacy at best, and you're already on the edge
And now it seems that you're the only one drowning in regret

Face me down the line, and bring your worthless alibi
Your self-proclaimed bequest to fame's the only thing tainting your name

You think you're not just another
But you're no better than the others
Rumor has a way of seeing through the end of anything
Truth will find a way of seeing through the end of anything
