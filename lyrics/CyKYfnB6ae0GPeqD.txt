A little early in spring
A bonfire ring, she's shivering alone
I bumped into you somehow

You can wear, my duct-taped vest
It's my party best, it's really all I own
Everything's changing now

And I am high like a star that's flying
Cassiopeia
Everything's changing now

She said it's alright
No, don't die alone
There's no goodbyes

Lightening comes and lightening goes
And it's all the same to me
Let it in
But then I want you so
I can hardly breathe, or release
Into one thousand pieces
I have broke into, over you
Night shade will soon be gone
I keep burning on

If nothing else I am myself
That's all I have to give
Everything's changing now

And we could live like kings if we take a risk
Or we could live in doubt
Everything's changing now
Oh now, come on, come on

Lightening comes and lightening goes
And it's all the same to me
Let it in
Cause I want you so
I can hardly breathe, or release
Into one thousand pieces
I have broke into, over you
Night shade will soon be gone
I keep burning on and on and on

This, this is, this is the last time
And this, this is, this is your goodbye
And this, this is, this is the last time
And this, this is, this is your goodbye

Some girls will break you down
Just to see you come undone
Everything's changing now

Maybe you and I are cursed
Or maybe you and I are one
And that's the universe
Spin round, keep changing

Lightening comes and lightening goes
And it's all the same to me
Let it in
Cause I want you so
I can hardly breathe, or release
Into one thousand pieces
I have broke into, over you
Snuff the flames at dawn
I keep burning on and on and on
