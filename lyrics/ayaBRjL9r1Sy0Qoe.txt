I shouldn't choose to play your games
What's more I lose all the same
And I come to realise how
I tell the truth, you haven't changed
Look breaks the tank and you hold the key
But I swear it's true, I know it's all the same
I saw you today
Heart break on your face
Won't someone remind me?
Don't ever come back
While my heart's still intact
I'll hide 'til you find me
I followed you into the dance
The place been reaped with bold cigarettes
And I warned you girl that we're all the same
Tell me the truth one last time
Did you feel my heart and ignore my cry?
You've got to know that it hurts me all the same
I, don't know
'Cause I got you on my mind
Yeah, I got you alright
I saw you today
Heart break on your face
Won't someone remind me?
Don't ever come back
While my heart's still intact
I'll hide 'till you find me
