Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

I hold my hands up high
And throw my glass into the sky
And when the morning comes
We'll never see the sun
And if the walls close in
Then let's just start it all again
That's when the evening comes

Oh yeah, the evening comes
No we're not going home tonight
Wake up the stars are shining
We'll do it, and we'll do it
And we'll do it again

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes
No my head don't feel so bright
What the hell happened last night?

Oh Yeah last night
Think we were dancing
Singing all our favorite songs
Think I might have kissed someone
And if tomorrow never comes
We had last night

Let's shut this party down
And pull the building to the ground
Yeah girl let's live it up
One night is all we got

Let's dance until we die
Nobody's going home tonight
This kiss could be our last
Come on and raise your glass

No we're not going home tonight
Wait up the stars are shine
Then we'll do it and we'll do it and we'll do it again

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes
And no my head don't feel so bright
What the hell happened last night?

Oh Yeah last night
Think we were dancing
Singing all our favorite songs
Think I might have kissed someone
And if tomorrow never comes
We had last night

We do it all again
We do it all again
So bring your friend
And tell your friend
We had last night

We do it all again
We do it all again
And by the end of the night
We had last night

We do it all again
We do it all again
So bring your friend
And tell your friend
We had last night

We do it all again
We do it all again
We had last night

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes
And no my head don't feel so bright
What the hell happened last night?

Oh Yeah last night
Think we were dancing
Singing all our favorite songs
Think I might have kissed someone
I hope tomorrow never comes
We had last night
