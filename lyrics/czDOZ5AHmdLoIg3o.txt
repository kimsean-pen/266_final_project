Whisper, whisper on
I won't forget to close your eyes for you
I'll sing before you lie down, down, down
Push your sleep along
Sink below the ground
Find the weeping, wailing calls you echo
And I'll build a house around you
Stir a moat until you drown

Whisk away your heart sigh and bury it in mine
Whisk away your heart sigh and bury it in mine

Only lonely, hidden breath beneath the floor
Only, only, where your tears drip from the drawers
Only lonely, hid the morning from the stars
Only, only, meeting glimmers in the dark

I can hear your back crackin'
Over the sky so you can wear it
Thunder whispered, oh so
You could bare it in

Only lonely, hidden breath beneath the floor
Only, only, where your tears drip from the drawers
Only lonely, hid the morning from the stars
Only, only, meeting glimmers in the dark

Come down, come now back
Carry on, wearily on [?]
Come down, come now back
Carry on, wearily on [?]
Only lonely, hidden breath beneath the floor
Only, only, where your tears drip from the drawers
Only lonely, hid the morning from the stars
Only, only, meeting glimmers in the dark
