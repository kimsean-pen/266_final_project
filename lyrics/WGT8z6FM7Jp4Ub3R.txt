there's a few bad things i've done
that nobody made me do
most just to get myself off
and the rest to get over you
though you meant the things you said
turns out i had no idea
i never told me we were done
oh and how i feel like to hear
now i know i'm not so special
cause i'm all dressed up
good you think that i'm beautiful
but it's not enough
now i know i'm not so special
cause i'm all dressed up
good you think that i'm beautiful
but it's not enough
guess i'm gonna find another bride
guess i'll see you in another life
guess i'm gonna tell one more lie
im surprised
you don't wanna stay by my side
think about the time
when i went down on you at the gallery
and i was always out of line
but i thought you were right there with me
now i know i'm not so special
cause you're all dressed up
and i think you're so beautiful
but i'm not your love
now i know i'm not so special
cause you're all dressed up
and i think you're so beautiful
but i'm not your love
guess i'm gonna find another bride
guess i'll see you in another life
guess i'm gonna tell one more lie
im surprised
you don't wanna stay by my side
stay by my, stay by my side
guess i'm gonna find another bride
guess i'll see you in another life
guess i'm gonna tell one more lie
im surprised
you don't wanna stay by my side
guess i'm gonna find another bride
guess i'll see you in another life
guess i'm gonna tell one more lie
im surprised
you don't wanna stay by my side
