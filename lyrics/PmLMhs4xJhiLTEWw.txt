Make a space
for my body...
Dig a hole,
push the sides apart...

This is what
I'm controlling...
It's the mould,
The inside that I carve...

This will be my monument
This will be a beacon when I'm gone...
gone...
gone...
when I'm gone...
gone...
gone...
When I'm gone...

So that when the moment comes,
I can say I did it all with love...
love...
love...
all with love...
love...
love...
all with...

Make a space
for my body...
Dig a hole,
push the sides apart...

This is what
I'm controlling...
It's the mould,
the inside that I carve...

This will be my monument,
this will be a beacon when I'm gone...
gone...
gone...
When I'm gone...
gone...
gone...
when I'm...

Make a cast
of my body...
Pull back out
so that I can see...
Let go of
how you knew me...
Let go of
what I used to be...

So that when the moment comes,
I can say I did it all with love...
love...
love...
all with love...
love...
love...
all with love...
love...
love...
love...
love...
all with love...
love...
love...
all with...
