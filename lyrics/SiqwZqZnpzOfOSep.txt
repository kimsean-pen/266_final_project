Sounds so cliche

catch phrase of the day
Middle, index

Just as complex

(Someone said give peace a chance)
And, that's all that we're saying
(While we're sitting on the fence)
Pretending
(Our hearts are in the right place
But your face shows a trace of)
Hypocrisy
Don't tread on me

(Someone said give peace a chance)
And, that's all that we're saying

Sounds so absurd, ha, sounds so absurd
We can't afford to say these words lightly, ha, ha, ha, ha
Or else our world will truly rest in peace
Make love not war, sounds so absurd to me
We can't afford to say these words lightly, yeah
Or else our world will truly rest in peace
Make love not war, sounds so absurd to me, oooh
We can't afford to say these words lightly
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Or else our world will truly rest in peace
