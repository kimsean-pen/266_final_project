I'd been putting off the burn
I thought the high court was on recess to adjourn, yeah
I wanted justice for whatever I lack
Oh, Samson, I never thought your hair would grow back

So do no harm
Mister Hiroshima, 'shima

'Cause I used to be your Holly Golightly
I could think of one to a thousand things I'd rather be
Than be your cheap painkiller

What if I slit my wrists and you were my last call
And you found out on your Facebook wall?
What if I got famous and convinced every fan
To write you a letter and say, "Treat her better, man"?

So do no harm
Mister Hiroshima, 'shima

'Cause I used to be your Holly Golightly
I could think of one to a thousand things I'd rather be
Than be your cheap painkiller
Your cheap painkiller

Mister Hiroshima, 'shima
Do no harm
Mister Hiroshima

'Cause I used to be your Holly Golightly
I could think of one to a thousand things I'd rather be
Than be your cheap painkiller
Your cheap painkiller
Your cheap painkiller
Your cheap pain
