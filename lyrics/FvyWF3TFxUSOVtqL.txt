The ... or the laws that I follow
Cause of the ... life today
So I'm talking I feel, ... over the shadow
I turn you my hand and I'll take you today
I couldn't refill you
Cause you move ... faster
Did you tried and feel like I was today
So it's down to skill
So it's just a death
But ... feel it, so far away
...for ever ... these... cry
How I ...
The ... resistance, consider...
...different, so far away
...no one standing, then why does it all fall
... far away.
