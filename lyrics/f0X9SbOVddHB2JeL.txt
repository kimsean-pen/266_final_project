Switch the light off welcome to the night
What's the problem, not gonna make it right?
Bite the bullet then pull the trigger hold tight
(It's a feeling you know)

Running under
Lights off in the sky
Nothing matters When you're in the fight
Hold your fire
Maybe we can make it all right
(You take, take, take, take me for no one)

But I don't know what to call it
When I know I don't care anymore
In the end we know It's always wrong

Cry out
Will you tell me now
So is everyone changing?
Never be the same
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Cry out
Oh I'm burning out
Can't you hear the sound?
(Voices all around)
(Cause we're going down)

In the moment, can't move from the start
So close, so hard to fall apart
Only heaven know how far we are
(I take, take, take, take you for no one)

I love this feeling
You're the only one that's really lost
Never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
(You take, take, take, take me for no one)

But I don't know what to call it
When I know I don't care anymore
In the end I know we'll all be gone

Cry out
Will you tell me now
So is everyone changing?
Never be the same
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Cry out
Oh I'm burning out
Can't you hear the sound?

One by one it's taking apart it's taking apart of me
Can't you hear the voices screaming?
Out loud to me I feel it
We can be the change we need it
Shout it out now shout it now
Can't you hear the voices screaming?
Out loud to me I feel it
We can be the change we need it
Shout it out now shout it now

Cry out
Will you tell me now
So is everyone changing?
Never be the same
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Cry out
Oh I'm burning out
Can't you hear the sound?
(Voices all around)
Can't you hear the sound?
(Cause we're going down)
(Voices all around)
