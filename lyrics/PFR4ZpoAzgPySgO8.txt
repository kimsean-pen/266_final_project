We started dancing and love put us into a groove
As soon as we started to move
The music played while our bodies displayed through the dance
Then love picked us out for romance

I thought it was clear the plan was we would share
This feeling just between ourselves
But when the music changed, the plan was rearranged
He went to dance with someone else

We started dancing and love put us into a groove
But now he's with somebody new
What does love want me to do?

Love said, "Let the music play
He won't get away
Just keep the groove
And he'll come back to you again"
Let it play
Let the music play
He won't get away
This groove he can't ignore
He won't leave you anymore
No, no, no

He tried pretending a dance is just a dance, but I see
He's dancing his way back to me
Guess he discover we are truly lovers, magic from the very start
'Cause love just kept me groovin' and he felt me movin'
Even though we danced apart
So we started dancing and love put us into the groove
As soon as we started to move
As soon as we started to move

Love said, "Let the music play, he won't get away
Just keep the groove
And then he'll come back to you again"
Let it play
Let the music play
He won't get away
This groove he can't ignore
He won't leave you anymore
No, no, no

He tried pretending a dance is just a dance, but I see
He's dancing his way back to me
He's dancing his way back to me
Love said, "Let the music play, he won't get away
Just keep the groove
And then he'll come back to you again"
Let the music play (let the music play)
He won't get away
This groove he can't ignore
He won't leave you anymore
Let the music play (let the music play)
He won't get away
Just keep the groove and then
He'll come back to you again
Let the music play (let the music play)
He won't get away
This groove he can't ignore
He won't leave you anymore
Let the music play
He won't get away
