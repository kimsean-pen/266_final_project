I? m watching you walk
As you walk that distant way
Take that thing away from me
Take away most everything

I couldn't say I? d blame you
But you should never look in back
You wouldn't be to blame
If you couldn't take it back

Hours slipping by as you watch
The worlds collide
And now you? re nothing more
Than another passerby

The dark it turns to light
In a distant flash of night
I'm rolling with the tide, I confide
The act we wear it thin again

If affection holds you back
Oh, then what is left to hold
If I could find the answer
To that question then I? d know

The thoughts that clutter up your mind
And leave me feeling drained
And walking, pacing up the walls
Across the floor again

And all the things I haven? t seen
Once the final curtain has been raised
The act, we act is wearing thin
The act, we act we under my skin

The words, the words we said goodbye
The words left choking in my mind
The act, we act is wearing thin
I think we wear it out again

Another big explosion
Leaving you hoping
That something that once held you down
Could leave you feeling on the ground

The confusion that persists
Decisions that you guessed
The one to stay and watch this
The one you might have missed

All the things I haven? t seen
Once the final curtain has been raised
The act, we act is wearing thin
The act, we act we under my skin

The words, the words we said goodbye
The words left choking in my mind
The act, we act is wearing thin
I think we wear it out again, now

The act, we act we under my skin, now
The act, we act we under my
Forming a conclusion
And you? re left standing
