It don't take much, a little affection
Just some of your time
That's all that I'm asking for
Feels like this dream will never come true

I just want somebody who
Knows how to listen and give me attention
Who won't break my heart
I have good intentions, I ain't hard to please
Don't need a lot, just show me that you care

Can you be there when I need you most
And when I say I don't
Make me feel secure, forever

I just need someone to love me
When it's hard to
I can trust with all my issues
Someone who is patient and consistent

I need good sex and commitment from somebody loyal
Understanding who won't change up
Take advantage on my emotions or my feelings
I need good sex and commitment

I don't want money
I'd rather f with somebody real
I can be myself upfront
Who makes me mad, don't makes me cry
Who knows what it means to sacrifice

If I'm having of bad day, you know just what to say
I can show you all my thoughts and where my demons play
And you won't use them against me
You rather use them to lift me

Can you be there when I need you most
Make me feel beautiful (Oh, oh, oh)
Give reassurance
4AM phone

I just need someone to love me
When it's hard to
I can trust with all my issues
Someone who's patient and consistent

I need good sex and commitment from somebody loyal
Understanding who wont change up
Take advantage of my emotions or feelings
I need good sex and commitment
