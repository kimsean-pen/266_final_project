You think this life would make me bolder
But I'm running scared is all
I hang on everything about you
You think I'd settle down cuz I'm older
But I roll with the changes is all
I'm same old trailer trash in new shoes

She gets sad when there's nothing going on
She says it makes her feel damn worthless

Well you got to think with a girl like that
Any love at all, is better than nothing
It's better than nothing

I put my hands around your shoulder
You're saying you're scared is all
I think I know too much about you
You think this life would make me colder
I'd give in to the alcohol
I put my loving arms around you, child

You knew damn well there was nothing going on
Is that what makes you feel damn worthless

Well you got to think with a girl like that
Any love is better than nothing
It's better than nothing
You got to think, with a girl like that
Any love at all, is better than nothing
It's better than nothing
Yeah she drags you down and she pulls you up
She pulls you up
Says that she's sorry now but it's not enough
To pull you up
She's sorry

I wake up quick just like I want to
Yeah but I stay out much too late
You think this life can get a bit unkind but she stays
Down till the worth is gone
And pulls you up, she pulls you up,
She pulls you up and over, over
Well you got to think with a girl like that
Any love is better than nothing
It's better than nothing
You got to think, with a girl like that
Any love at all, is better than nothing
It's better than nothing
Yeah she drags you down and she pulls you up
She pulls you up
Says that she's sorry now but it's not enough
To pull you up
She's sorry

Well you got to think with a girl like that
Any love at all, is better than nothing
It's better than nothing
