He's got a way with words
So I got away from him.
He's got ocean blue eyes
and I just realized I can't swim.
He's got a spell he casts
with the way he laughs
something his smile does
that I'd believe in fact that the world was flat
if he smiled when he said it was

Every life so pretty
don't you dare fall for it
That's what I tell myself as I lie here on the floor

So here I am, once again
Trying to smell the scent of plastic roses,
Roses

Hear as good as it feels
I know your love is no more real
Than plastic roses, and the roses
Roses

Ignorance is bliss
But see I know it's a lie
Which in lies a problem with this

Is it wrong to pretend
I don't know that the truth exists
Can I make believe
I'm a fool just long enough
For one last kiss

Every night so pretty
Don't you dare fall for it
That's what I tell myself as I lie here on the floor

So here I am, once again
Trying to smell the scent of plastic roses,
Roses

Willingly the fool,
cause you can only do to me what I let you
all so beautiful, this bouquet of disease
But to me the roses never smelled so sweet
smelled so sweet never smelled soo sweet
Yeah

So here I am, once again
Trying to smell the scent of plastic roses,
Roses
