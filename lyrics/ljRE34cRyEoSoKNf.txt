Pray for me
Suffer peace
Wait for sleep
It's like a sickness that we breathe
Is it too much further
Is it too much further
Is it too much further
Is it too much further for you?

Feeling our way, we are
Lost in the fray, but burning bright
Feeling the same
Lost in the dark, we are so light
We are so light
We are so light

Feeling our way, we are
Lost in the fray, but burning bright
Feeling the same
Lost in the dark, we are so light
We are so light
We are so light
