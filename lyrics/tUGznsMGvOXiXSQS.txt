From the east to the south
I tongue the roof of my mouth
To new days of doubt without you
First gear

I face the trouble ahead
Final word's been said
Long distance spread between us
I tell myself to

Hold on, won't be long
Till I grow through this struggle
Time to wake up
Find my soul

Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you

Not called for weeks now
It's six days without sleep means
I am a slave to my early grave

If I do not be brave, behave
Seize myself out of this mess
I have created of myself yet again
Yet again I say

Hold on, won't be long
Till I grow through this struggle
Time to wake up
Find my soul

Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you

We go on, heart beats strong
Still whole, unbroken
As we divide our love goodbye
Thanks for the time, time of my life

Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you

Time, time of my life
Time, time of my life
(So happy without you)

Time, time of my life
Thanks for the time of my life
(Happy without you, happy without you)

Happy without you
