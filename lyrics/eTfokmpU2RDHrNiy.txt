Ooh, ooh, ooh
L-L-Lastic

I was down and out, [?], yeah
Who stress, where he come from?
Ooh yeah, gettin' numb, numb
What's wrong? Know your business, baby
You'll know if you comin' with me
Hop in, do you wanna, [?] you gonna

Strip down, easy
Move low, quickly
Don't know what's real, that's real
Mind gone, wavy
Touch, feelin' safe
But will we end the sorrows here?

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
'Til the morning company I need
Ooh, ooh, ooh (yeah, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Give it 'til I'm right down to my knees

Now we at your spot, takin' shots
Be sick when it all [?]
Ooh shit, all the patience's gone
Love me 'til the pain is gone
Missed call, don't you view it, baby
Right now, when your world is ending
Ooh quick, give me fun, fun (yeah)
'Til I see the sun, sun (yeah)

Strip down, easy
Move low, quickly
Don't know what's real, that's real
Mind gone, wavy
Touch, feelin' safe
But will we end the sorrows here?

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
'Til the morning company I need
Ooh, ooh, ooh (yeah, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Give it 'til I'm right down to my knees

Erase my mind, 'til morning is here, is here (woah, is here)
You'll be my drug, 'til the sun bring me to (to wake me up)
We spend the night back, we don't remember much
Wake up and reset, time to wake up again
We spend the night back, we don't remember much
Wake up and reset, time to wake up again

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
'Til the morning company I need
Ooh, ooh, ooh (yeah, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Give it 'til I'm right down to my knees
