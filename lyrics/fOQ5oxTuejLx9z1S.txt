So you just stand there
With a dollar at your feet
And you wait as I retreat
To go get mine
And when I get back
You're still waiting silently
Cause my mother's fast asleep
Right next door

Yeah, I'm 26 and I still live with my parents
Oh, I can't do laundry
Christ, I can't do dishes
What'll I do without you
When your body fails you
When nobody loves you
All they do is miss you
But they don't even care
So be careful when you run downstairs
Be careful who you talk to
Or the wonderful way you walk
You are like a magnet for evil

So you just stand there
With a dollar at your feet
And you wait as I retreat
To go get mine
And when I get back
You're too terrified to speak
And my brother's such a creep
Even more

Yeah, be careful when you run downstairs
Be careful who you talk to
Or the wonderful way you walk
You are like a magnet for evil
Cause there's so much good inside you
And I wish that I could hide you
Some place no one could hurt you
Where nobody could change you

I'll lock you in my room
And I'll tie you to the sheets
Cause I could watch you sleep for weeks
Oh, the things you'd never see
If it were up to me

Oh, I can't do laundry
Christ, I can't do dishes
What'll I do without you
