There's blood in the sun
There's blood in the sun
But I'm not afraid
I cut myself with Heaven's blade

Inside the wound I found my wings
And walked away from this human skin

I asked the earth to open up the sky
To get inside and live with me for life

I stand before the sun
Rise up and see the shape of things to come
It's all the same
(repeated)

Just cut yourself
(repeated)
With Heaven's blade
Just cut yourself
With Heaven's blade
Just cut yourself
With Heaven's blade
(repeated)
