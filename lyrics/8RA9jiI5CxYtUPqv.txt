It's all about confidence baby
She was a confident lady
And I know she's driving me crazy
I know she'd probably hate me

And I should've said this
And I should've said that
All that I know now

It's all about confidence baby
She was a confident lady
And I know she's driving me crazy
I know she'd probably hate me

I think she knows, and I think she knows
She's making me nervous, she's making me nervous
I think she knows, and I think she knows
She's out of my league

'Cause it's all about confidence baby
She was a confident lady
And I know she's driving me crazy
I know she'd probably hate me

And I should've said this
And I should've said that
All that I know now

It's all about confidence baby
She was a confident lady
And I know she's driving me crazy
I know she'd probably hate me

I think she knows, and I think she knows
She's making me nervous, she's making me nervous
I think she knows, and I think she knows
She's out of my league
