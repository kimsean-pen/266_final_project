Consider this a sign
This is a train in the night
And now it's time for you to go
You know you had a healthy life boy
You walk this world like you're a ghost
Your hands are coming through the needles
Sick of your tragic and the evils
I am the keeper of the songs of everyone

Look into the sun and see
Your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith
But now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone
What you have stolen from everyone
How are you feeling?
Seems a little sick to me now

This is a coming of the times
You are a witness to the movement
If all you're seeing is lies
You had your chance, but now you've blown it
You want this world so you can own them
I am the keeper of the songs of everyone

Look into the sun and see
Your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith
But now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone
What you have stolen from everyone
How are you feeling?
Seems a little sick to me now

From the light on high
A chance to change your fate
Forgiveness falling down
On those who chose to wait
Remember the time
Find yourself home again
Deep within your life
Find yourself home again
Find yourself home again
It's a choice
You have chosen your own

In the old days
When the world was young and bright
If you raise the mask
Who will lead us home tonight

Look into the sun and see
Your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith
But now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone
What you have stolen from everyone
How are you feeling?

Look into the sun and see
Your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith
But now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone
What you have stolen from everyone
How are you feeling?
Seems a little sick
Seems a little sick
Seems a little sick to me now
