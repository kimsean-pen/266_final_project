But I don't know how this whole business started
Of you thinkin' that I had been untrue...
But if you think that we'd be better parted
It's gonna hurt me but I'll break away from you...

Well, just give me the sign

I will be gone... yeah...

(that's how much I feel)
Feel for you, baby
(how much I need)
Well I need your touch
(how much I live)
I live for your loving
That's how much that's how much

That's how much that's how much
Oooh

Sleep alone and late at night I'm dreamin'
Of the togetherness that seems to be leavin' me...
Oh, no (aaah...)

Give it all and then I'd give some more
(aaah...)

If you would only love me like you had before

Well take hold of my hand
All will be forgiven... (aaah...) yeah...

(that's how much I feel)
Feel for you baby
(how much I need)
I need your touch
(how much I live)
I live for your loving
Well that's how much that's how much
That's how much that's how much
So you try... (try...)
Try to stay in the middle... (try...)
And then you cry... (cry...)
Well you cry just a little... (cry...)
Then you both realize
Just how foolish you've been, oooh
(aaah...)
And you try to make amends
But you're better off as friends
'Cause that's how much that's how much
That's how much that's how much
Oooh
How's your life been goin' on?
I've got a wife now
Years we've been goin' strong
Oh, no (aaah...)
There's just something that I've got to say
(aaah...)
Sometimes when we make love
I still see your face (aaah...)
Ooh... just try to recall when we were as one (aaah...) yeah... (aaah...)
(that's how much I feel)
Feel for you baby
(how much I need)
I need your touch
(how much I live)
I live for your loving
That's how much
