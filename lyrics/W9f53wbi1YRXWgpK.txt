Boy you let me down
I am so confused
I stood right by your side through everything that you went through
Why is she around?
Why are you so cruel?
How could you just turn your back when I stood by you?

When you were broke I didn't leave you
Somehow through it all I believed in you
No, no, no not my man
'Cause he would never hurt me
Let alone just desert me
No, no, no not my man

Word around town
Is that you live with her
And you said she took your heart away, oh baby
I told them that's a lie
'Cause I don't wanna hear no bullshit stories 'bout my man

Can't stop the screaming and yelling (Oh no no I'll pass)
No I just can't believe that you're with her
Is she the one you played me for? (My man)
Shoulda noticed it the day she walked in the door (My man)
I just can't believe she stole my man
Not my man (oh yeah)
She walked right in the door
Looked me in the face and she took my man

Never trust a lonely woman with the one you love
She ate dinner at my table, even watched my kids
And she took my man
Bitch acting like she was my friend
She called me about her man, but I didn't understand
She was talking 'bout my man, heifer
Oh my man, my man, my man, my man, my man
My man, man, man, man, woo

Is this my life?
It cuts me like a knife
To know the one I loved could leave me for a friend
I'm not desperate, but I would reconsider (Baby I ain't sorry)
All the years I put in this thing to be a winner
But I know it's too late, she took my man
(Not my man)
See I was just a fool
Didn't wanna see the truth and she took my man
And my heart screams out loud
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, woah (not my man)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (not my man)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (not my man)
Not my man, no, no, no (not my man)
