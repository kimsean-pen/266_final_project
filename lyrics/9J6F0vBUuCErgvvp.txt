There's no law
There's no God
There's no harm
There's no love

We are more like you
Than the ones that you knew

Fountain bold
Crystal dress
Tribeca queen
Dismantle cross

We are more like you
Than the ones that you knew

Is it that we know we are animals?
All because to them we are animals
You're inventing words for defending me
While I know to shoot for the enemy
While I know to shoot from the enemy
You're inventing words for defending me
It's because to them we are animals
Or because we know we are animals

Concrete soul
Machine the heart
Poison creep
Prime me for love

We are more like you
Than the ones that you knew

Is it that we know we are animals?
All because to them we are animals
You're inventing words for defending me
While I know to shoot for the enemy
While I know to shoot from the enemy
You're inventing words for defending me
It's because to them we are animals
Or because we know we are animals

Is it that we know we are animals?
All because to them we are animals
You're inventing words for defending me
While I know to shoot for the enemy
While I know to shoot from the enemy
You're inventing words for defending me
It's because to them we are animals
Or because we know we are animals

There's no law
There's no God
There's no harm
There's no love

We are more like you
Than the ones that you knew
