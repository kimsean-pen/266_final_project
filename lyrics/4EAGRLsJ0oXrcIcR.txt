There's nothing left to say
'Cause you don't want to try
And I don't want the pain.

There's nothing let to do.
I don't want the lies,
And you don't feel the same.

It's time to let you go
And bow out of the game
And maybe we will find
The answers through the blame.

It's time for me to go.
It's time for me to go.
