All aboard, just say goodbye, raise your sword, you are gonna die!

Ride the waves with your boat, and pull up your anchor.
This wind leads us to shore
But there is nothing to explore.
On the deck from side to side, pull up the black flag
Come on, let's take control.
Time to kill, to steal and to roll.
Time for me to set things straight!
For the mistakes we made!
The ocean will be afraid!
Of our mad crusade!
Ship to shore!
We are the ocean's criminals, pirates that will kill you all.
Fear is what we provide now.
The wind is on our side.
So you would better run away.

You know you are sinking much further as you swim
We are not in the world where you live in.
You will give it up
If you are not on our side, so...
Tell me what you decide!
Oh! We are not here to stay we are here to strike you today!
Your fall will be so hard that you would better run away!

We are the ocean's criminals, pirates that will kill you all.

Fear is what we provide now.
The wind is on our side.
So you'd better run away.
Ship to shore, we will find your treasure! Close your door!
This is war, and this is nothing more than the way we are!

Just say goodbye...

My friends!

On the horizon a merchant ship in sight
(In sight)
And the crew makes ready to board and fight.
(And fight)
Sail the seas for eternity!
We are the ocean's criminals, pirates that will kill you all.
Fear is what we provide now.
The wind is on our side.
So you'd better run away.
Ship to shore, we will find your treasure! Close your door!
This is war, and there is nowhere to hide.
Compass will be our guide!
Compass will be our guide!
