Help me darling now I'm feeling lonely
Help me darling now I feel afraid
Ah, help me darling now I'm feeling older
And I now, the time, it doesn't wait

Help me darling now I'm feeling tired
Help me darling now I'm feeling low
But honey I just wanna let the sun in
Let the day just come and go

And I just want to find
Oh, I just want to find
All the secrets that you're keeping inside
Oh, I do, I do

Help me darling now I'm feeling so lost
And help me darling now I'm feeling shy
With you I see the world completely different
With you I need no place to hide

And some would like it best if their headed for you chest
But I just wanna talk again tonight
And some would be okay, just washing you away
But I don't wanna do that anymore
'Cause it's real

And now I know it's real
Oh, yes I know, it's real
And now I know, it's love, oh it's love, oh it's love
Just let the sun in, it's love, oh it's love
Just let the sun in, it's love, oh it's love, ay
Just let the sun in, it's love, oh I love
Oh, it's love
Oh, it's love
Oh, it's love
Oh, it's love
Oh, it's love
Oh, it's love
Oh, it's love
Oh, it's love
