Together, together, alone
Stay true, true to your phone
Together, together, alone
Stay true, true to your phone

But I wanna talk
Talk until the neighbors knock
And I wanna move
Move the furniture around the living room
'Cause I wanna dance, unwind the universe
'Cause I wanna talk, talk until my throat hurts

Come and sit next to me, faces lit by a screen
What does it mean inside, outside reality?
I want in real life, turned on the Christmas lights
And put on a song, one that's kind of fast and kind of long
'Cause I wanna dance, unwind the universe
'Cause I wanna talk, talk until my throat hurts

Together, together, alone
Stay true, true to your phone
Together, together, alone
Stay true, true to your phone

But I wanna talk
Talk until the neighbors knock
Cause I wanna move, move, move
Move the furniture around the living room
'Cause I wanna dance, unwind the universe
'Cause I wanna talk, talk until my throat hurts
'Cause I wanna dance, unwind the universe
'Cause I wanna talk, talk until my throat hurts
