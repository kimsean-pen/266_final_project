Please don't speak
Don't make a peep and wake a vacant spark
Please don't eek
Don't make a creek and shake her aching heart
She's so sweet
Don't make a scene and break her brazen charm
She's so weak
Just leave her be a ways away from harm

Stop with gawking
Making mockeries to seize the light
Stop with talk
Your gaping chops will taunt and tease her might
Soft like cotton
Breaking constantly she has tears to wipe
Watch her blossom, oh

Worth your ear, huh?!
Hurts to hear, huh?!

Hold your mutter
If you love her, leave these dreams to grow
Hold your blunder
She won't run from greed with reek of hope
Fold like butter
Under summer breeze a pleasing cold
Phony lover, no

Worth your ear, huh?!
Hurts to hear, huh?!
Worth your ear, huh?!
Hurts to hear, huh?!

Wait up sir
What have you heard?
That sounds absurd
For I'm not hurt
I have lost my pearls
Both my pearls
