I can feel your shadow
I just wanna be next to you
Wanna be next to you

I can't fight the world's battles
I just wanna be next to you
Wanna be next to you

I don't have any country
I did but it tore me up
And I don't know anymore

And this life is such a mystery
But I don't feel so fucked up
As long as I'm next to you

So many people
Watch how they fall
So many good ones
Can't be who they are
So many people
Are fading away
So many people
Can't make it today, no

Days go by and I'll never know
I'll never have words to explain what is going on
Guns are pointed at everyone
But together we're better off
I wanna be next to you

So many people
Watch how they fall
So many good ones
Can't be who they are
So many people
Are fading away
So many people
Can't make it today, no

But I'm with you
But I'm with you
Yeah, I'm with you
You
You
