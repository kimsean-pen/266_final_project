Don't listen to what they say
Make up your mind, walk away
Oh don't even give them the time of day
They put you wrong, turn away

So why'd they all just walk away
There was something wrong
But you don't want to say

Oh why did they listen to someone else
I did something wrong
Something

Oh that attitude
They all got that attitude
Oh that attitude
They all got that attitude

Something they say
Make up your mind, walk away
Oh never happen again
They've all gone wrong, gone insane

That's why they all just walked away
There was nothing wrong
Didn't want to say
Oh that's why they listened to somebody else
I did nothing wrong
Nothing I could say

That's why, that's why
That's why, that's why
