You're my bad habit, I'm trying not to love you like I do
(But it's no use, you know it's no use, you know it's no use)
You're my bad habit, no, somehow I don't wanna be rid of you
(But it's no use, you know it's no use)

It's obvious to me your kiss is lethal
Your drug of choice is love and I can't come down
All the names under the sun
You could be everyone but I still want you bad, some say it's sad

You're my bad habit, I'm trying not to love you like I do
(But it's no use, you know it's no use, you know it's no use)
You're my bad habit, no, somehow I don't wanna be rid of you
(But it's no use, you know it's no use)

Always got someone out lookin' for you
And sometimes I just wanna knock you out
You think I've lost half of my brain, clinically I'm insane
'Cause I fiend for you bad, you're the best I ever had

You're my bad habit, I'm trying not to love you like I do
(But it's no use, you know it's no use, you know it's no use)
You're my bad habit, no, and somehow I don't wanna be rid of you
(But it's no use, you know it's no use)

You do me so wrong but you love me so right
There's more than one reason why you shouldn't be in my life
To tell you I don't want you no more would be a lie
So I gotta step back and accept the fact that, you're my

You're my bad habit, no, I'm trying not to love you like I do, oh I do
(But it's no use, you know it's no use, you know it's no use)
You're my bad habit, baby, I'm trying not to love you like I do
(But it's no use, you know it's no use)
Like I do, ooh I don't wanna be

I need to have you baby
I'm lost without your tasty
You're my drug, my lifetime craving
You're my bad habit, baby

You're, you're you're you're my
You're, you're you're you're my
You're, you're you're you're my
