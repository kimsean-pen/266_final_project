Across the street, the river runs
Down in the gutter, life is slippin' away
Let me still exist in another place
Runnin' undercover of a helicopter blade
The flames are gettin' higher in effigy
Burnin' down the bridges of my memory
Love may still be alive somewhere, some way
Where they're downing only deer
A hundred steel towns away

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beatin' like a drum
With the words "I love you"
Rolling off my tongue
Oh, never will I roam
Now I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailin'

Photographs, kerosine
Light my darkness, light it up, light it up
I can still feel the touch
Of your thin blue jeans
Runnin' down the alley
I've got my eyes all over you baby, oh baby

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beatin' like a drum
With the words "I love you"
Rolling off my tongue
Oh, never will I roam
Now I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailin'

Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shiftin' like the handle of a slot machine
Love may still exist in another place
I'm just yankin' back the handle, no expression on my face

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beatin' like a drum
With the words "I love you"
Rolling off my tongue
Oh, never will I roam
Now I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailin'

The rhythm of my heart
Is beatin' like a drum
With the words "I love you"
Rolling off my tongue
Never will I roam
Now I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailin'
