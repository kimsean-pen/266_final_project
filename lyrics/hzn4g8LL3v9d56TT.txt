What's that in the corner?
It's too dark to see
What's that noise I'm hearing
Who's that calling me?

Long ago and far away I heard your voice
But once I heard you sing your song I had no choice
Terror took control it told me what to say
And let me loose I fear I've finally found a way

After dark, I see you
After dark, I feel you
After dark, I want you
After dark, I need you

Of age there is no question
Death's shadow is undone
We only need each other
In shelter from the sun

Long ago and far away I heard your voice
But once I heard you sing your song I had no choice
Terror took control it told me what to say
And let me loose I fear I've finally found a way

After dark, I need you
After dark, I want you
After dark, I feel you
After dark, I see you

There's no turning back now
My fate is traced in blood
I've tasted true salvation
Your power is my drug

Long ago and far away I heard your voice
But once I heard you sing your song I had no choice
Terror took control it told me what to say
And let me loose I fear I've finally found a way

After dark, I need you
After dark, I want you
After dark, I feel you
After dark, I see you
After dark, I touch you
After dark, I do!
After dark
After dark
After dark
