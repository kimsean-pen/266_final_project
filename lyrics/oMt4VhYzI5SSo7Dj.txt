I'm sorry that I hit you
But my string snapped
I'm sorry I disturbed your cat-nap
But whilst finishing a chore
I asked myself "what for"
Then something snapped,
I had a relapse... A Suburban relapse

I was washing up the dishes
Minding my own business
When my string snapped
I had a relapse... A Suburban relapse

(Should I?)
Throw things at the neighbors
Expose myself to strangers?
Kill myself or... you?
Now memory gets hazy?
I think I must be crazy
But my string snapped
I had a relapse...
A suburban relapse
