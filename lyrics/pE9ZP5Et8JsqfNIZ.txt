And when the body finally starts to let go
let it all go at once
not piece by piece,
but like a whole bucket of stars
dumped into the universe
Whoooh! Watch it go!
Good-bye small hands,
good-bye small heart,
good-bye small head
My soul is climbing tree trunks and swinging from every branch

They're calling on me,
they're calling on me
they're calling on... (I am fine)
They're calling on me,

they're calling on me
they're calling on... (I'm not blind)
Do you think I'm an animal?
Am I not?
Do you like fur (I'm alright)
Do you wanna come over
Are we captive only for a short time (I'm not blind)
Is there splendor, I'm not ashamed (The way you move,)
Desire shoots through me (no waves were ever)

like birds singing (quite as fluid)
They're calling on me,

they're calling on me
they're calling on... (I am fine)
They're calling on me,

they're calling on me
they're calling on... (I'm not blind)
I hit the mark
I target moon,

I target sky,
I target sun.

Fall down on the world
Fall down on the world
Fall down on the world before it falls on you.
Like beggars, like stars,
like whores, us all
Like beggars, like dogs (I'm alright)
Like Stars, us all (I'm not blind)
Shoot for my heart (And when you were near)
Shoot straight for my heart (no sky was ever quite as clear)
Like stars, so small
Like us, when we fall
Like beggars, like whores (I am fine)
Like lovers, Get Up!
Too far
Get Up!
Too far
Like stars above
Look down we're so small
Like stars above (I am scared)
Look down on us all (and I'm not scared)
