Help me
Something is a misery
Save me
Somebody wants to take me
Kill me
So I have a reason to live
Take me
So I have a reason to give

I'm in my prison
And I am the only prey
You are the reason
Why my heart and soul would stay

La la la la la
La la la la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't forget it on my mind
I can't remember
La la la la la
La la la la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't be coming home tonight, oh

Faster
Cars are slowly moving
Shining
Like a dream that we are facing

I'm in my prison
And I am the only prey
You are the reason
Why my heart and soul would stay

La la la la la
La la la la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't forget it on my mind
I can't remember
La la la la la
La la la la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't be coming home tonight, oh

I'm in my prison
And I am the only prey
You are the reason
Why my heart and soul would stay

La la la la la
La la la la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't forget it on my mind
I can't remember
La la la la la
La la la la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't be coming home tonight, oh

La la la la la
La la la la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't forget it on my mind
I can't remember
La la la la la
La la la la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't be coming home tonight, oh
