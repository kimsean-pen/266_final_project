I'm a sweet
Little love maker
Finding time
To make my words better (I)
Lately I, not so present now

Not in low
For your constant fun
I've got time, but your tired of waiting
Do you only want me in open spaces?

Come fill your gaps with people
I don't know one so lonely trying to be yours
When you're looking for so much more
You forgot how we fell in love

I'm your sweet little love maker
You're younger than I am broken
I dance feelings like that sparkle
So my conversations not enough
So lonely trying to be yours

What a forsaken curse
So lonely trying to be yours
When you're looking for so much more
(So lonely trying)

How does it feel for him to think about you?
Wishing that words were enough to consume you
So lonely trying to be yours

How does it feel for him to think about you?
So lonely trying to be yours
What a forsaken curse
So lonely trying to be yours
When you're looking for so much more
To be yours
To be yours
