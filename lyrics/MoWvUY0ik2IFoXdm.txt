Anxiously I enter the necropolis
A defile for me to chose
Six feet below me - object of lust and defilement

Deep red - dark abyssal Eden
Six feet below me, a tortured soul on all fours to go

Deep red - necrotic nemesis
Six feet behind me, a pounded corpse
On all fours to go

Anxiously I enter the necropojlis
A defile for me to chose
Six feet below me
Object of lust and defilement

There's no addiction like this
Spellbound by her sphincter
I wreck havoc beyond abasement

Deep red - she bled
From tomb and purity stripped away
Deep red - she fucking bled
Roast beef of sullen meat a main course today
Your god is dead, now come let us pray

Deep red - she bled
From tomb and purity stripped away

Your god is dead, now come let us pray

The bonding of the living and the grave
amore morte
With pure passion and surreal delight
I sucked her dry and ate her rare
Your god is dead, now come let us pray

Deep red - she bled
From tomb and purity stripped away
Your god is me, now come fornicate

Deep red - she fucking bled
Roast beef of sullen meat a main course today

Nothing can quench my appetite
All I need is my afternoon delight
Through rotting meat and crumbling bones
A gross feast I relentlessly adore
Nothing can hold me from my sodomite
All I need is my afternoon delight
A shall devastate and fornicate
Through sin and lust the heavens I rape
