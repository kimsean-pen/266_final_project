The heart it is a beast, we're not written equally
Where can we lay this blame, between the clouds and the flames?
Raise my hand up to the sun, dazed in mortuary
Crimson drops upon the ground, confusion all around, confusion all around

I know that she loves me, why do I always pull it all apart
I know that she gets me, yeah she's always got my back
I know that she adores me, she's everything I want
But black has always been the colour of my heart
The colour of my heart

Under a silent moon, beats a sea without a shore
Hear the floorboards creek while the angels gently weep
The chambers of the sun, will they judge me now?
The great eternity is all but mystery, all but mystery

I know that she loves me, why do I always pull it all apart
I know that she gets me, yeah she's always got my back
I know that she adores me, she's everything I want
But black has always been the colour of my heart
The colour of my heart
