It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

From the start it's plain to see
You're suffering from a serious broken heart,
You know that it's a shame
But I'm here to ease your pain
There's no need for you to feel so all alone
When you and I could seriously
Be a sure enough happening thing

Don't you know that
It takes two to make a thing go right?
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

I can see it in your eyes
You feel the same way I feel about you
Some call it chemistry
I call it you should be with me
'Cause I know together we can really turn this mother out
In my mind there is no doubt
That one and one equals me and you

Don't you know that it takes two to make a thing go right?
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
Eh, eh, eh!

I don't believe in fairy tales
I believe some things were meant to be
Why should we be alone
When we could have each others arms to hold?
I know together we could really turn this mother out
In my mind there is no doubt
That one and one equals me and you

Don't you know that it takes two to make a thing go right?
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you

Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you and me, together we will be
Forever and ever, eeeeh!

It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you
Me and you, takes you and me
My man, my man, my man, my man, my man, my man
