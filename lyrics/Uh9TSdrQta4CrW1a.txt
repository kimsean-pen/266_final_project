And I'm up down spinning around
I'm high and dry and kicked to the ground
I'm lost and ill never be found
My lips were much too shy
The lines about you they never rhymed
And you said I'd never get things right
(I never said it was the best thing for you)

And baby where'd you go
I need you here tonight

Singing myself to sleep
And you're still my favorite melody
It's been three weeks
How long can this go on
Singing myself to sleep
And you're haunting every memory
Goodbye, get out, of my life
Goodnight

And you're hot cold
You're bad around the bones
You run while I lose control
I miss you forever you'll stay gold
And girl you know I'm not getting by
I've lost it you're in my mind
And everyday's the darkest day of my life
(I never said it was the best thing for you)

And baby where'd you go
I need you here tonight

Singing myself to sleep
And you're still my favorite melody
It's been three weeks
How long can this go on
Singing myself to sleep
And you're haunting every memory
Goodbye, get out, of my life
Goodnight

Cause I'm drowning when I close my eyes
And I'm falling can't breathe tonight
and our story has fade to black inside (inside)
