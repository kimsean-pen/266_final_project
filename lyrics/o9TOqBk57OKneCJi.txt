Damn
Thought I was someone
Thought we were something
It's always hard to understand
When every feeling
Leaves with no reason
Can't even balance no more
'Cause I put all my weight on you

But you're gone
Don't care how much I try
You're gone
And I'm not too surprised
You're gone
When you're all that's on my mind

You're gone
You're gone

Damn
I poured the concrete
You laid the ceiling
And it hurts to tear it down
But our home is empty
And all of the memories
I keep trying to erase
But I spent all my change on you

But you're gone
Don't care how much I try
You're gone
And I'm not too surprised
You're gone
When you're all that's on my mind

You're gone
You're gone

How did a feeling so strong
End up just feeling so wrong?
Answers to questions I want

But you're gone
Don't care how much I try
You're gone
And I'm not too surprised
You're gone
When you're all that's on my mind

You're gone
You're gone
You're gone
