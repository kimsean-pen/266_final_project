If I could speak to the breeze
What would she teach?
I'd ask politely for peace
Or some guidance at least
Perhaps she'd tell me to leave
Conceal the secrets in the air that I breathe

If I could speak to the sea
What would she preach?
I'd ask her what does it mean, to know the depths of belief?
Perhaps she'd guide me beneath
Reveal the meaning in the fathoms unseen

Then they'd say reality, was never for me
Reality, was never for me, never for me

If I could speak to the trees
What would they plea?
I'd watch the wind thieve their sees
Lend them moments to grieve
Perhaps they'll bleed just like me
Deliver their message in the words that I read

If I could speak to the leaves
What would they heed?
I'd ask them what do they seek?
As they descend from the trees
Perhaps they'd rest at my feet
Administer healing in the tea that I drink

Then they'd say reality, was never for me
Reality, was never for me, never for me

How am I to understand
Everything I am
If I don't look beyond the thoughts I have?
Learning that it takes some time
To separate the mind
And I just wonder now
If all that I have ever known
Is all that I was ever shown
Questioning who sees behind these eyes
Maybe If I find a reason, that lasts beyond the seasons

I'd ask if reality was ever for me
Reality, was never for me, never for me

If I could see the supreme
What would he think?
If he stood in front of me, would I believe?
He'd ask me to take a sit
Pour us a drink
And show me all I could be
