The other day when someone asked me
"are you living your dream?"
I didn't know what to say,
I honestly had to think.
I try to be so many places at the same time
Every day a million things cluttering up my mind.
Another feather falling off my wings
I climb so high it gets hard to breathe
Forget to remember, what I really need.

What means the most to me
Is waking up next to you.
Feel the morning breeze
Your my favorite thing in love
Coming home to your arms
When you kiss me hello
It's these simple things that mean the most to me.
That mean the most to me, yeah.

Every time I have to leave
I feel like I'm leaving a part of me
You're the only place I want to be.
Well nothing else matters
I just loose focus
Swinging all around cause your the only one I notice
I can't help the way I feel.
It doesn't matter if I win or Loose
Cuz
What means the most to me
Is waking up next to you
When you're holding me
& have a little time to play
In your arms rest your heart laugh till it gets dark
It's these simple things that mean the most to me
Yeahh ohh

No more days far away where I miss you.
No more nights trying to fall asleep without you
From now on I'm always gunna be there
I wont miss another day that we wont share
I'll be there
Cuz
You mean the most to me
Oh
You mean the most to me
Now that I'm here with you
I will stay by your side
I wont leave you this time
Oh no
The next time that someone asks me
"are you living your dream?"
I guess I'll know what to say
I wont even have to think.
