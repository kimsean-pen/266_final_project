I remember it was that Wednesday
Oh, when it rained and it rained
They traipsed mud all over the house
It took hours and hours to scrub it out

All over the hall carpet
I took my mop and my bucket
And I cleaned and I cleaned
The kitchen floor until it sparkled

Then I took my laundry basket
And put all the linen in it
And everythin' I could fit in it
All our dirty clothes

That hadn't gone into the wash
And all your shirts
And jeans and things
And put them in the new

Washing machine
Washing machine
Washing machine

I watched them go 'round and 'round
My blouse wrappin' itself around your trousers
Oh, and the waves are goin' out
My skirt floatin' up around my waist

As I wade out into the surf
Oh, and the waves are comin' in
Oh, and the waves are goin' out
Oh, and you're standin' right behind me

Little fish swim between my legs
Oh, and the waves are comin' in
Oh, and the waves are goin' out
Oh, and the waves are comin' in

Out of the corner of my eye
I think, I see you standin' outside
But it's just your shirt, hangin' on the washing line
Wavin' its arm as the wind blows by

And it looks so alive
Nice and white
Just like it's climbed
Right out of my

Washing machine
Washing machine
Washing machine

Slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy
Get that dirty shirty clean
Slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy
Make those cuffs and collars gleam
Everything clean and shiny

Washing machine
Washing machine
