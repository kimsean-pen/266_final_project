Taken back, overdone
Free and safely
Souvenirs out of style
(Right before you got it all)
You do it so, I'll be mad
You'll be gone

Enough said you be go apart
On and writing
Tango with daddy
Seperate only
Smile my only right of passage

Only you, mark my words
to get engaged in California

Enough said you be go apart
On and writing
Tango with daddy
Seperate only
Smile my only right of passage

Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose
Don't say I'm the one you want to lose
