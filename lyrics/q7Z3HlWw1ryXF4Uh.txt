Your eyes they have this glowing
You were more than I deserve
After all our shame and suffering
I turn my back to everything or anyone
And put you first

But are we really in love, completely in love?
Did mentioning make your skin start to crawl?

Started off limping and broken
It unfolded like a dream
Dazzled by the very thought of it
Like the way dreams are supposed to be

If I'm not what's to come
I will sleep with that I will carry that on
And we will lose in the end
Only start the whole pattern over again
Over again

Are you truly in love, absolutely in love?
You're happy enough
Are you fully in love?

If I'm not the point in carrying on
Why spend half the time indifferent
And the other half alone?

I will live with my regrets
Learn from, accept them, and be done with them
Start the whole thing o...
Start the whole thing over again now

It unfolded like a dream
Like the way dreams are supposed to be
It unfolded like a dream
Like the way dreams are supposed to be
