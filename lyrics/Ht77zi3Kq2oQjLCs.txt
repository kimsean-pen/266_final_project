When I was young
Lying in the grass
I felt so safe
In a warming bath
Of sunlight, of sunlight

Vast open sky
Could do no harm
Like an embrace
Of a mother's arms
In sunlight, in sunlight
In sunlight, in sunlight

With every year
That came to pass
More clouds appeared
Till the sky went black
And there was no sunlight, no sunlight
And there was no sunlight, no sunlight anymore

It disappeared at the same speed
The idealistic things I believed
And the optimist died inside of me

No sunlight, no sunlight
No sunlight, no sunlight

It disappeared at the same speed
The idealistic things I believed
And the optimist died inside of me

No sunlight, no sunlight
No sunlight, no sunlight
No sunlight, no sunlight
No sunlight, no sunlight
No sunlight anymore
