I give you this [?] for a second
I can't [?] but I'm keeping my promise
You are so sweet when you act right [?]
I give you this [?] for a second

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Just let me drown
Just let me drown
Give me a bow
Give me a bow

Hey, I can take it-take it side ways
I can make it-make it my way
We can do this like all day
I'mma flip it-flip it like this
Do you take it-take it like that
But sometimes it gets a little black
Sometimes it gets a little [?]
Sometimes it gets a little hard (babe)
[?] just to make that buck
So that you get paid
I know you came to change my life
Just know you're my ride or die

Don't let me down
Don't let me down, no
Just let me drown
Don't let me drown, oh
Give me a bow
Give me a bow, oh-oh

Don't get me
Don't get me, ohh
Just let me
Just let me, oh
Give me a
Give me a, oh-oh
