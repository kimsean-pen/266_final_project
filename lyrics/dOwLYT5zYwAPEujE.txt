Think you know it now
When you've finally had enough
Memories unzip themselves
Fill my head full of doubt

Hop on planes and try to figure out
I'm checking off the boxes on ways I could fix myself
Dreams of life so hollow but it sells
Don't get up too close to the fire you're starting to melt

Fairytales aside
Miracles are dangerous
Rectify all your flaws
It's all poison

Floating so high I think I could taste it all
But the comedown's steep, you're dizzy from the fall
Pick your scabs, you say they've healed before
Irrational and angry, it's familiar I recall

Scouring
Who knows what you might find there
Discovering
There's more than surface deep desires

Runnin out of ways to stay in line
When will I find a space that I could feel safe inside
Busy hands and bitter tired minds
There's only so much my head can handle at a time
