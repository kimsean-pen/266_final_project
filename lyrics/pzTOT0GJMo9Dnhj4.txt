Come into your hotel room,
And you told me that the things I showed you just wouldn't do.
Put me down in front of the quays,
Then you told me that you'd make the changes you wanna see.

Oh Brian won't you come out
Instead you swim around
Oh Brian won't you come out
Instead you swim around
Oh Brian won't you come out

Tell me what it's like to head south
Before I accidentally tell you what I'm thinking about
Told a joke I shouldn't have made
Now you're teling me you're never gonna come back again

Oh Brian won't you come out
Instead you swim around
Oh Brian wont you come out
Instead you swim around

You're trying to save me, but maybe
All that I want is you
You're to help me, so tell me
All that I want is you
All that I want is you

Oh Brian won't you come out
Instead you swim around
Oh Brian won't you come out
Instead you swim around

You're trying to save me, but maybe
All that I want is you
You're trying to help me, so tell me
All that I want is you

Oh Brian won't you come out
Oh Brian won't you come out
Oh Brian won't you come out
Oh Brian won't you come out
