When my heart starts beating like a hammer
and my eyes get full of tears,
oh, when my heart starts beating like a hammer
and my eyes get full of tears,
you know you've only been gone 24 hours, baby,
oh, but it seems like, it seems like a million years.

now if i ever mistreated you baby,
you know i didn't mean no harm.
oh, if i ever mistreated you baby,
god knows i didn't mean no harm.
you know, i'm just a little country boy, baby,
and i was raised right down on the cotton farm.

oh, you give me so much trouble, baby,
babe, that i don't know what to do.
oh, you give me so much trouble, baby,
baby, i don't know, i don't know what to do.
oh, i ain't got nothing, i ain't got nothing now, baby,
babe, and it's all on, it's all on account of you.
