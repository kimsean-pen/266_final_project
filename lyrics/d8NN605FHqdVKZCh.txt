Baby I see this world has made you sad
Some people can be bad
The things they do, the thing they say
But baby I'll wipe away those bitter tears
I'll chase away those restless jears
That turn your blue skies into grey

Why worry, there should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
There things has always been the some
So why worry now

Baby when I'm down I turn to you
And you make sense of what I do
I know it isn't hard to say
Bat baby just when this world seems mean
Our love comes shining red and gold and cold
And all the rest is by the way

Why worry, there should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
There things has always been the some
So why worry now
