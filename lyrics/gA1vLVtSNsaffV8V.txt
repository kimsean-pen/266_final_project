I woke up when it was getting dark
That's not how life is supposed to work
But I got up on my own
And I looked at my phone
We're all talking about nothing
I wanna do something cool
And I wanna get paid
And wake up feeling great every day
Is that too much to ask?
Is that too much to ask?
Well maybe, I'm an idiot

Thoughts drowned in()
A sinking feeling
I'd rather be thinking about something else

Now the walls are caving in
I see and feel everything in waves
And the air is too thick
It's making me sick
I should get out and get over it
