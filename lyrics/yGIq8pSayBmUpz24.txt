The elevator in the hotel lobby has a lazy door
The man inside is going to a hotel room
He jumped out right after seeing just the very sight of me
Decided he better hike it to the second floor

It's temporary, this place I'm in
I permanently won't do this again
My belongings scattered all across the hotel floor

An hour later I was thinking it over by the snack machine
I thought about you in a candy bar
An hour later melon gum stuck between my teeth
I fell asleep to the greatest movie of the year

A man gets lonely for heavens sakes
Was wondering only what did you do today
The world is spinning round to an old sad song

It's coming down outside like I've never even seen before
I fell into some kind of sorry state
But looking back now I think it's finally time for me to laugh about it
Get my things together and find something to say

Well, I feel awful and I believe that time gets wasted in this misery
And darling, I don't ever wanna come back home
