Go on my gun
stop you and carry on
You haven't been there
time to sell the rose around
she takes it now
You give it up

You'll steal this one, when all is over
You'll go and you can, see all you gave her
You'll flee the door, your eyes glowing
She's there but you can't, keep on going

Racing on
ties it up and moves along
You're waiting there
came into the room and then
You stare me down
you turn around

You'll steal this one, when all is over
You'll go and you can, see all you gave her
You'll flee the door, your eyes glowing
She's there but you can't, keep on going x2
