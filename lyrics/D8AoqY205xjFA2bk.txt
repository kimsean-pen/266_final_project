I heard you singing in the shower
The alarm went off again
And now you're putting on your makeup
I'm still laying in the bed
And I thought I could never stay
I'd feel stuck in one place
Then you came along
And all of that changed

I've got these visions keep coming up, coming up
That I cant shake, all day, all day
I've got these visions keep coming up, coming up, so I wait

Now if time is what it takes
I'll be here, I'll be waiting for you
I don't need a break
No tears, always in your corner
You know, I'll be waiting for you
You know, always yours
My hearts always yours
My heart
My hearts always yours
My heart, my heart

I used to be just weekends
Now I want ya' every day
I believe you when you tell me
You wouldn't have it any other way

All these visions keeping taking up, taking up
All of my time, is this the right time
Every day I keep waking up, waking saying goodbye

Now if time is what it takes
I'll be here, I'll be waiting for you
I don't need a break
No tears, always in your corner
You know, I'll be waiting for you
You know, always yours
My hearts always yours
My heart
My hearts always yours
My heart, my heart

All these visions got me staying up, staying up
All of my life, I'm never on time
Every day I keep waking up, waking thinking goodbye, goodbye

Now if time is what it takes
I'll be here, I'll be waiting for you
I don't need a break
No tears, always in your corner
You know, I'll be waiting for you
You know, I'll be waiting for you
You know, my heart's breaking for you
It's yours
My hearts always yours
My heart
My hearts always yours
My heart
My hearts always yours
My heart, my heart
My heart, my heart
