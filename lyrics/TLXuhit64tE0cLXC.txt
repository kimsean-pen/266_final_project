Reeling the liars in. We are reeling the liars in. We are removing their face, collecting their skin, we are reeling the liars in. We are burning thmen in a pile. We are burning them in a pile. The only true thing, the place to begin, is to burn up the liar pile.
Now the sun will hide beneath the ridge tonight. Clear flames of revenge will lick the black sky. And I, I will sing as you eat their tongues. For I am the saint who will lead them to us...
So I'm reeling the liars in, reeling the liars in, Here is my, now drive the nail in, I am reeling the liars in. Here is my tongue, now cut out my sin, we are reeling the liars in. There is only one way. One place to begin. By reeling this liar in.
