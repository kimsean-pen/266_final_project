When you wake up
For when you wake up

There once was a land little known to your kind
There once was a land only we knew how to find
Where we were fire
Simmer down, simmer down

Ah...
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)

When my hands are sore from carrying this weight around
When my eyes are numb, and the air is failing on our lungs
And we're left with a bitter taste on our tongues

Your shallow truth
Fractures and distorts
Our self views
And my tether beat
Echoes in the minds
Of a few

(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
For when you wake up
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
For when you wake up
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...)

All light absorbed, in the shadows I will hide
'Til the contour of my silhouette fades to undefined
I still have fire
Simmer down, simmer down

Your shallow truth
Fractures and distorts
Our self views
And my tether beat
Echoes in the minds
Of a few

Your shallow truth
Fractures and distorts
Our self views
And my tether beat
Echoes in the minds
Of a few

When you wake up
For when you wake up
