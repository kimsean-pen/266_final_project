Here it comes, another lonely day, playing the game
I'll sail away on a voyage of no return to see
If eternal life is meant to be
And if I find the key to the eternal dream

The painted ladies of the Avalon play in the sun, take to the road
To the North, there lies the chills of cold
To the South, there lies the tales untold
But in-between, there lies the place to close your eyes

And I will stay
I'll not be back, Eldorado
I will be free, yeah
Of the world, Eldorado

"Say goodbye", the city's heroes sing, bird on the wing
Feel, feel so free, though the life upon the rooftop haze
All the cheating and the broken days
So through it all I see, there's nothing left for me

So I will stay
I'll not be back, Eldorado
I will be free, yeah
Of the world, Eldorado

Sitting here on top of everywhere, what do I care?
Days never end, know the voyage's end will soon be here
No eternal life is here for me
But now I found the key to the eternal dream

Then I will stay
I'll not be back, Eldorado
I will be free, yeah
Of the world, Eldorado
Then I will stay
I'll not be back, Eldorado
