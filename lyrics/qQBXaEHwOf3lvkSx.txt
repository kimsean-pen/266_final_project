Oh, don't you think that I'm bound to react now
Well, my fingers definitely turning to black now, yeeah
Maybe I'll put my love on ice
And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice, yeaah

My books are sitting at the top of the stack now
Well, The longer words are really breaking my back now, yeaah
Maybe I'll learn to understand,
Drawing a square with a pencil in hand, yeah

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ahh, ahhh

Mathematically turning the page
Unequivocally showing my age
I'm practically center stage

Undeniably earning your wage
Well, maybe I'll put my love on ice
Teach myself, maybe that'll be nice, yeeaah

Listen master can you answer a question
Is it the fingers, or the brain that you're teaching the lesson
Oh, I can't tell you how proud I am
Writing down things I don't understand

Well, maybe I'll put my love on ice
And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice,
Yeeaah, yeeeah, yeeeah, yeeeah.
