The void, is like space.
Now space contains everything,
The mountains the oceans the stars.
The good people and the bad people.
The Clock? the Arms? everything.
Now the the mind in us.
The true mind is like that.
You will find that when bodies use the word mind.
The have several words with mind,
but i'm not going into that particolare calgery.
They mean space.
See space is your mind.
