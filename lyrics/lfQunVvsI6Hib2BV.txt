Will I wake up? Some dream I made up
No, I guess it's reality.
What will change us? Or will we mess up
Our only chance to connect with a dream?

Say a prayer for me
(Say a prayer for me)
Say a prayer for me

Say a prayer for me
(Say a prayer for me)
I'm buried by the sound

Of a world of human wreckage
In a world of human wreckage
In a world of human wreckage
Where I'm lost and I'm found and I can't touch the ground
I'm plowed into the sound

To see wide open with a head that's broken
Hang a life on some tragedy
Plow me under the ground that covers
The message that is the seed

Say a prayer for me
(Say a prayer for me)
Say a prayer for me

Say a prayer for me
(Say a prayer for me)
I'm buried by the sound

Of a world of human wreckage
In a world of human wreckage
In a world of human wreckage
Where I'm lost and I'm found and I can't touch the ground
I'm plowed into the sound

Will I wake up? Some dream I made up
No, I guess it's reality!
