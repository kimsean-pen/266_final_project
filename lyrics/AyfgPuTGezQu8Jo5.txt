Pick a day from memory, when innocence was common
It's just not like that anymore
We've all seen better days, been bitten by familiar ways
The result of giving til it hurts
This is our time, so take some sound advice
A simple life is a life worth fighting for
Make their antics deafening, while the drama queens keep punishing all the time
Cuz what they say is ridiculous
Rehashing history lives little left to mystery and what's the fun in living in the past?
This is our time, so take some sound advice
A simple life is a life worth fighting for
Make their antics deafening while the drama queens keep punishing all the time
Cuz what they say is ridiculous
Swerving down memory lane
We've moved ahead, you're still the same
Forget those memories, move forward once in awhile
Cuz we're still changing
Changing all the time
All the time
All the time
We're changing
Swerving down memory lane
We've moved ahead, you're still the same
Forget those memories, move forward once in awhile
Cuz we're still changing
