You fire words but all they do is ricochet
You think I'm paying the price but it's not costing me
Your love was a waste of time, you've been left behind
You made no mark on me, you're gone and you left no sign
You're not on my mind, don't try to press rewind
It's like walking on snow, without leaving a trace
You know what you said never carried away
I came out untouched and in another place
When ya gonna get it
I'm so unaffected
When I was flying high you tried to clip my wings
(You shot me out of the sky)
You tried to make it up by buying expensive things
(My love you cannot buy)
Your love was a waste of time, you've been left behind
You made no mark on me, you're gone and you left no sign
You're not on my mind, don't try to press rewind
It's like walking on snow, without leaving a trace
You know what you said never carried away
I came out untouched and in another place
When ya gonna get it
I'm so unaffected
It's like walking on snow, without leaving a trace
You're not gonna see, gonna see this heart break
You huff and you puff but I'm not blown away
When are you gonna get it
I'm so unaffected
You try and find, find faults in me
You project yourself, hate so easily
You already lost so you push me more
'Cause I didn't buy it so, so you push me so
One, two, three, four
It's like walking on snow, without leaving a trace
You know what you said never carried away
I came out untouched and in another place
When ya gonna get it
I'm so unaffected
It's like walking on snow, without leaving a trace
You're not gonna see, gonna see this heart break
You huff and you puff but I'm not blown away
When are you gonna get it
I'm so unaffected
(Leaving a trace,
See this heart break, untouched and in another place)
When are you gonna get it
I'm so unaffected
