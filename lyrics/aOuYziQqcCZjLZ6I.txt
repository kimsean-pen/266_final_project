You aren't what I love
You aren't what I need
You aren't what I love
You aren't what I need
What I need
No, don't let them take me down there
Don't let them take me down there
Don't let them take me down there
Don't let them take me down
You aren't what I love
You aren't what I see
You hate from above
You become what I need
What I need
