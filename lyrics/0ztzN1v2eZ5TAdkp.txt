There's a sign in the rain
Every now and again
It is a symbol of hope
In the midst of a catastrophic episode

In the hour of death
There's a spiritual wealth
When we dance through the rain
And form the signs once again

If even for a second

I hear a voice on the air
It has a warning to share
"Don't believe what you see"
"You can't perceive what you feel"

But if I do what I'm told
And shun the spirit I hold
I'm no longer a human
And I will not shift with the sands

The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you

The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you

There are moments of doubt when I don't know what to do
And giving in is the only way out
When there's too much shouting about how I should choose

Incapacitated, I'm left behind
In a sea of hatred I go blind
A storm is coming, I hide away
In the years of need reason leads astray

The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you

The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you
He lives in you
He lives in you
