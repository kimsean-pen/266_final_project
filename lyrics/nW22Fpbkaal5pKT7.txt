I'm dropping out of school
I found a new
Job
Doing what I love
And you can't stop me now
Mom and dad
Sorry that you had
To find things out this way
But I guess you could say
It's better now with me
Being the one
To take your souls away

I wanna be the grim reaper
I wanna be the grim reaper
I wanna be the grim reaper
I wanna be the grim reaper

And nothing you say
Could change my mind
