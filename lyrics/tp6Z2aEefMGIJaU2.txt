Love seems all I want
Love seems all I need
Love seems everything
I know everything bleeds

Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds

Love for things I love
Love for thing to think
Love for everything
I know everything bleeds

Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds

Do, do you know my name?
Do, do you know what I've shamed?
Do, do you think I'm lost?
Do, do you think I pray?

Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds

Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
