I lie awake, no one can hear me, no one can hear when I scream.
I'm trapped in here in a fortress you created and locked me in
I talk to myself, I hide in the corner, I'm delusional like sedated.
I'm trapped in here in this fortress you created and locked me in.

Sarah...

Release me, release me from your cage,
Release me from these chains you created!
Release me from this rusted cage, you have to let me go
I'm not your property! I'm dying here!

I follow my footsteps wet on the floor, they're changing to blood trailed marks.
What I've done, you must tell me because I'm losing it, I don't dare to find out!
I don't know this person, who's that in the mirror, those fierce staring eyes reflecting.
I'm trapped in here in this fortress you created and locked me in.

Release me, release me from your cage,
Release me from these chains you created!
Release me from this rusted cage, you have to let me go
I'm not your property! I'm dying here!
