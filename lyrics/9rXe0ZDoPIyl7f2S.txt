A divisive force
Bestowed with the power of gods
Move us like pawns
Marching us towards the fall

Conquerors of heaven
Tearing down our gates
Like hands of God
Molding our world's fate

Their vipers unleashed
Their conspiracies slither among us
Orchestrating death
The filthiest of work in motion

Masters of perdition
Imprison us in chains
Like hands of God
Choking life and seeding ruin

Pull the strings that oppress
Another day of pain
Like nooses around our necks
We die once again

Taint the air and fill our lungs
Poison the ground and drink it deep
Masses of fire seen for miles
Watch the horizon burn with their greed

All glimmers of hope will fade
Corral us in and watch us fail
Wretched forms of humanity
Consuming all life and light

Like demons racing towards the sun
We'll fall to ashes one by one

Pull the strings that oppress
Another day of pain
Like nooses around our necks
We die once again
