Don't, don't know
Like it's ever gonna change it
Don't, don't know
I can't find, I can't find my words right now
To describe what's really goin' on
I can't mind, I can't mind my own right now
And it's a world of insanity but it's my home
And I can't change it
But I can change myself
No, I can't change it
But I can change myself

Got so caught up in my world,
Seems like it's never gonna change at all
No, no, no
I just gotta throw up my hands
Some things are never gonna understand ooh, no, no
Got so caught up in my world,
Seems like it's never gonna change at all
No, no, no
I just gotta throw up my hands

Some things are never gonna understand ooh, no, no

I can't find, I can't find y peace of mine
But I can close, I can close my eyes and see
I can try, I can try to read between these lines
All I know is a cuffery
But I can't change it
But I can change myself

No I can't change it
But I can change my self

Got so caught up in my world,
Seems like it's never gonna change at all
No, no, no
I just gotta throw up my hands
Some things are never gonna understand ooh, no, no
Got so caught up in my world,
Seems like it's never gonna change at all
No, no, no
I just gotta throw up my hands
Some things are never gonna understand ooh, no, no
