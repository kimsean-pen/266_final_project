To the freedom fighters, to the everest climbers, to the castaways
To the midnight riders, to the spark igniters, I am on my way
Let it be said, and let it be known,
He who is free is never alone
The path before us, the world behind us
I'll wait for you there

To the lost ark raiders, to the lion tamers, to the stowaway
To the white tide chaser, to the black flag raiser, I'm on my way

Let it be said, and let it be known,
He who is free is never alone
The path behind us, the world before us
I'll wait for you there

There's a song that sailors know
Lost, alone and far from home
Golden gallions. golden guns
And find that place under the sun

There's a song on the Sahara wind
That lifts you to your feet again

That dances on the clockwork stars
That pulses through a beating heart
