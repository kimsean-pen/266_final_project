On the night we met
It was your birthday
I bought a cardigan and you stole it
Then we all went back
Back to your place
Everyone fell asleep by the fireplace

You played a song for me on your guitar
But I got too tired from the alcohol
So you lent me a shirt to sleep in
And you left me alone until morning

You got me
You win again every time
I give into you
You've got me now
You win again every time
I'm blaming it all on you

On the night we went on our first date
We ate terrible food at a diner
Then we both went back
Back to my place
And we watched a movie on my laptop
