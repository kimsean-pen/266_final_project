I try to find you
If I can relate
To beauty in things
I would come down
Come down
Change who I am
Make most of it up
Pretend its my fault
And lack of your opinions
Of anything, well
I'm okay
I'm alright
I believe that this time
Everything will work out, yeah
Don't wanna lie to you

Change a thing
And make most of it up
Pretend its my fault

For something to lean on
