I can't believe I have to sit around and watch what you do

Hurt people, hurt people, yeah yeah
She said: Hurt people, hurt people, yeah
Hurt people, hurt people, yeah

He told me: Watch after my kids, please

That all changed when I met Lucy
(Oh Lucy, oh Lucy, oh yeah)
That all changed oh Lucy
(Oh Lucy, oh Lucy, oh yeah)

She said: Hurt people, hurt people, yeah
Hurt people, hurt people, yeah yeah
She said: Hurt people, hurt people, yeah
Hurt people, hurt people, yeah

She said: Hurt people, hurt people, yeah
Hurt people, hurt people, yeah yeah
She said: Hurt people, hurt people, yeah
Hurt people, hurt people, yeah
