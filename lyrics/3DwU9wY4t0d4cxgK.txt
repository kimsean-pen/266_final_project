Something's calling in the night
Electric madness roars in sight
Heat is rising, blazing fast
Hot and evil, feel the blast

Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at ya

Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives

Raging fury, wired for sound
Nitro bombshell shakes the ground
High and mighty rips the air
Piercing lazer, burning glaze

Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at ya

Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives

Temperature is boiling, magnifying might
Feeding like a virus, flashing light
Imminent collision, shockwaves all around
Generating energy, screams so loud

It's comin', meltdown
Start runnin', countdown

Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives
Oh yes
Metal meltdown
Metal meltdown
Metal meltdown
Metal meltdown
Metal meltdown
Metal meltdown
Metal meltdown
Metal meltdown
