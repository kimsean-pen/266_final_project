Take me away
From the same barren place
My mind always drags me back to
Stuck here again
Abandoned in the end
Can't keep track of all I've been through

Never stopped falling apart
Burning years off my life just to fall apart my way in the end
Anything to keep me at distance
I'll sew my eyes shut if it means I'll never see your face again

I'll sew my eyes shut if that means I won't see you again
Now I know
I won't see you again

Can't keep myself together when your voice is lingering in my head
Can't keep myself together when I'm dying to move past you
Just leave me be
I want my last breath in peace
Watch closely as my eyes roll backwards
Take my life from me
Just as I find out what it means
It's the only way the world moves forward

Never stopped falling apart
Burning years off my life just to fall apart my way in the end
Anything to keep me at distance
I'll sew my eyes shut if it means I'll never see your face again

I'll sew my eyes shut if that means I won't see you again
Now I know
I won't see you again

I'll sew my eyes shut if that means I won't see you again
Now I know
I won't see you again

You'll never understand the ditch I dig in my head
You'll never understand the ditch I dig in my head

I'll sew my eyes shut if it means I won't see you again
I'll sew my eyes shut if it means I won't see you again
I'll sew my eyes
I'll sew my eyes
