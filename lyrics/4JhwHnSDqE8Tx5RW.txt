With the strength of the mountains,
come forth from the North; Agios Daimon!
With the hunger of oceans,
come forth from the West; Agios Daimon!
As fire and flame,
come forth from the South; Agios Daimon!
As thunder and storm,
come forth from the East; Agios Daimon!

In the darkness,
in the nothingness of absent light,
where no life force is permitted to exist.
From far beyond the borders,
where god not dares,
the Serpent gloats in hunger.

No star will shine tonight.
No star, no matter how bright.
Across the firmament goes its flight.
A great darkness devouring the light.

God of Death. Manifest.
God of Doom. Move and appear!

Spread thine countless tentacles
across the universe.
Let them spasm throughout
the labyrinth of trembling stars.
Strangle their flickering flames,
eat them whole.
Wander ancient Dragon,
across the cursed heavens.

Yes, behold now as it opens
to swallow the world
and to melt the very essence of creation.
The burning mouth of SamaÃ«l,
through which all shall be reborn.
Wide agape now in this final hour.

And from its reeking darkness
a new kingdom shall ascend,
erected on the pillars
of the ever-burning underworld.
Can't you see the twisted branches
of the tree of Death?
Rising now in putrid doom
at the center of the world!

Let us welcome the Bringer of the End
with open arms.
Let us adorn the gates to nothingness
with blood.
Let us lay its enemies
like palmleaves upon the path
on which the Lord is coming in glory.

The upheaval of the ages,
that naught shall shun.
Time and space devoured as one.
From your abode in the dark,
come forth; Thou who eats the stars!

God of Death. Manifest.
God of Doom. Move and appear!
God of Death. Manifest.
Strike once more.
Stellarvore.
