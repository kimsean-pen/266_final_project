You can find me drifting slowly sinking beneath the sea
Try to catch my breath, a silent struggle drowned in my apathy
Yeah I'm still caught up in all the things I know I'll never be
Erase me

You won't find me
Because I don't know where I am myself you see
I've been waiting for so long and hoping that I'd see
A sign to point me in the right direction
Where I am the signs have been torn down
No I won't be found

Feeling fragile, cast aside these walls surround you
Losing touch with what surround you, I just don't feel like myself anymore.
Can't even sleep. Take my dreams they're yours to keep
Take my head and hold me down, I'm in too deep I can't get out

Running in circles and falling in hopes on the way to where I'm trying to go
Most of the time that I think there's an end I come to find out that it's not even close.

You can find me drifting slowly sinking beneath the sea
Try to catch my breath, a silent struggle drowned in my apathy
Yeah I'm still caught up in all the things I know I'll never be
Erase me

Most of the time, I'm invisible
Most of the time, I'm between the cracks
Most of the time, I'm wandering
Most of the time, I'm not coming back

Most of the time, I'm hopelessly lost
Most of the time, I'm between the tracks
Most of the time, you'll find me drifting
Most of the time, I'm never coming back
