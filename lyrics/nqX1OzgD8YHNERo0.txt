There's a way just walk the line
Keep your direction
And read the signs
Just play the game or fade away
Make your confessions and book a ride

Now that your sparkling smile is outworn
Now that your famous blue raincoat is torn
Spin me a lie and we'll slip through the haze
Just like Louise we'll get lost in the shades

Change your name and change your face
For your protection and the new day
Believe in me you can be free
Escape the aggression and book that ride

Now you're a rat and you can't sleep at night
Under the spell of the following eye
This is the game there's no getting out
I've seen the end and it looks like a nine
You feel the chill that just crept down your spine
This time, the last surrender
The axe won't be buried, not ever, not sorry
It is too late to worry
