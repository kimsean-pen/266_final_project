Small fish stuck in a fish bowl
Do you pine for the sea?
Watching life all around you
Are you looking at me?

Swim around in a circle
Come along when it's feeding time
You're the king of the castle
Who likes to hide (whoa-oh)
But when you find the ocean
How will you know where to go?

Oohhhhh ooh ooh, oh
Oooh-oooh oooh ooh oh oh
Yeah...

小さい場所だけど
幸せそう
When I see you tomorrow
Will you remember this song?

Oohhhhh ooh ooh, oh
Oooh-oooh oooh ooh oh oh
Yeah...
