You leave me, you leave me again. Can't change how I feel. I cannot pretend.
That I don't feel, that I'm not real.
You're a ghost. A haunting dream. Hold me close, stay with me. Even if it's just make believe.
You lied to me. You lied to me before. I can't trust you. I cannot ignore the things that you do.
Because it was always you.
