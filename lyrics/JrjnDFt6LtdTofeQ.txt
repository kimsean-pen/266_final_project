Every other night
When the last light of your life hits your eyes
Every other night
There's a feeling that we're bound to make it right
But I need a ghostwriter
To make my words brighter
'Cause every single day
I lean over to the shadows

Don't slip in our footsteps, ooh
'Cause we're running with the devil
Don't slide into regrets, ooh
There's too much to unravel
I was brave and gave you a promise
From now on I would only be honest
Kicking myself in the morning
Kicking myself at night

Every other day
When you open up you eyes and check your head
Every other day
When you wake up and regret the things you've said
I need a hard reminder
Or the thickest blinders
'Cause every other night
I believe that we can make it

Don't slip in our footsteps, ooh
'Cause we're running with the devil
Don't slide into regrets, ooh
There's too much to unravel
There's a map, there's a path through the madness
But the dirt snaps back like a magnet
Kicking myself in the morning
Kicking myself at night

Kicking myself in the morning
Kicking myself at night
Kicking myself in the morning
Kicking myself at night
Kicking myself in the morning
Kicking myself at night
Kicking myself in the morning
Kicking myself at night
