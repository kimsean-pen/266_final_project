Hello, it's nice to see you again
Did you miss me
We're meant to be friends
But it feels like a century
In my head

If I say something that comes out all wrong
Please forgive me
For feeling this strong
Like it feels just like angels
Hm, in my head

But darling the truth is
In darkness I'm ruthless
I wanna scream your name
Again and again

Maybe I
Intend to but all that I see
You're nothing like me
I'm circling the room
In golden french perfume

But darling the truth is
In darkness I'm ruthless
I wanna scream your name
Again and again

Oh baby
I'm misunderstood
You look the only one who knows that could
See it all in black and white
Who could be by my side

Oh baby I don't want to be
The only one that's talking my sleep
I could be your lullaby
Be my lover if you might

Can we fly away?
Can we fly away?

'Cause darling the truth is
In darkness I'm ruthless
I wanna scream your name
Again and again

Oh baby I don't want to be
The only one that's talking in my sleep
I could be your lullaby
Be my lover if you might
