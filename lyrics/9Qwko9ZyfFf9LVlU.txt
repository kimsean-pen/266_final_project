I can't be
The one who sets you free
There's no place
For you to follow me
Consumed by
The way you try
To fill voids
Deep inside
I can't feel my atrophy
And I don't want to be
All I see is vanity
And I don't want to be
I can't fill
You're self identity
There's no chance
You'll ever find
Your peace
Confused by
The way you lie
To yourself
To sleep tight
I can't feel my atrophy
And I don't want to be
All I see is vanity
And I don't want to be
I can't feel my atrophy
And I don't want to be
All I see is vanity
And I don't want to be
