I gave you your regal name.
'Cause you treat me like a queen, but like a queen I don't know we'll be slain.
And now I'm fifth in line to the throne.
How am I gonna tell my king that I don't trust his throne anymore?

If you want me to leave, then I'll go.
If you want me to stay, let it show.
Do you want me to leave?
Let me know.
Just let me know.

I have seen your deepest flaws.
I'm ashamed to say they made me want you more.
Then I was in awe.

If you want me to leave, then I'll go.
Do you want me to stay?
Let it show.
If you want me to leave, let me know.
Just let me know.

If you want me to leave, then I'll go.
If you want me to stay, let it show.
If you want me to leave, let me know.
Just let me know.

Let me know.

Let me go.
