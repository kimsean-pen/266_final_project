I got the call today, i didn't wanna hear
But i knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone
And i thought of all the bad luck,
And the struggles we went through
And how i lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

I'm learning to live without you now
But i miss you sometimes
The more i know, the less i understand
All the things i thought i knew, i'm learning again
I've been tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But i think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
...people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age
The trust and self-assurance that can lead to happiness
They're the very things we kill, i guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms
And the work i put between us,
Doesn't keep me warm

I'm learning to live without you now
But i miss you, baby
The more i know, the less i understand
All the things i thought i figured out, i have to learn again
I've been tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But i think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

There are people in your life who've come and gone
They let you down, you know they hurt your pride
Better put it all behind you; life goes on
You keep carrying that anger, it'll eat you inside

I've been tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But i think it's about forgiveness

Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

I've been tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So i'm thinkin' about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore
