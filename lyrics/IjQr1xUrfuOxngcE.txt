Moon, I already know
I'm small on the ground
I roll around and feel menacing mountains
And all depths of sorrow dwarf me
All towering terrors of mine to cower below
I know I know I know already

So don't look at me like that
And then duck behind clouds
I know I'm small and that I have no idea
I know I know I know

Let me be dumb again
Let food drip off my chin
Let me think you're alight
Please Please let me sleep through the night
and knowing
Let me close eyes
