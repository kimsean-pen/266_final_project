You were the right face at the wrong time, love
I only wish I woulda known it
Wouldn't have been so quick to give you up
When you got a good thing you should hold it

We were almost legends, you and me
We were almost perfect
We were almost like the people in the paintings
It's like we were almost
It's like we were almost famous, famous, famous
It's like we were almost famous, famous, famous

Much as I want to, I can't lie now, babe
Oh, I can't deny how much I miss you
But we were just victims of the time and place
Oh, lack of love was not the issue
I changed my mind
I turned to tell you, you were already gone

We were almost legends, you and me
We were almost perfect
We were almost like the people in the paintings
It's like we were almost
It's like we were almost famous, famous, famous
It's like we were almost famous, famous, famous

It's funny how
We say "Forever"
I see you now
You're just a stranger
We wave hello
Say "See you later"
I'll see you later
It's funny how

We were almost legends, you and me
We were almost perfect, yeah
We were almost like the people in the paintings
It's like we were almost
It's like we were almost famous, famous, famous
It's like we were almost famous, famous, famous
It's like we were almost famous, famous, famous, yeah
It's like we were almost famous, famous, famous

You were the right face at the wrong time, love
I only wish I woulda known it
