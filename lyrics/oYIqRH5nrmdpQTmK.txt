You, you ain't ever got time
You're rushing (when I call)
You, you be sitting here acting
Like it's not your fault

Baby you drive me crazy
But how come you so damn lazy?
I don't like it but I put up with you
Baby don't you change no

Oh baby 'cause you hurt so good
And I love to love ya, love to love ya, love to love ya
That's the thing I love, it's the 'making up for' line
Every time we fight
(That's the thing I love)
You been giving me one thing that's the way it is
And I really love it when you, what I mean is
You're so good I can't believe it
Ohh and I never get enough
Baby that's because
That's the thing I love
(That's the thing, the thing I love)
Baby that's the thing, the thing I love

You, you ain't taking me out
You're always working late
You, be rushing it always saying
'I love you babe'
The less you give attention
The more my heart's affection
I don't like it but I put up with you
Baby stay the same, ohhh

Oh baby 'cause you hurt so good
And I love to love ya, love to love ya, love to love ya
That's the thing I love, it's the 'making up for' line
Every time we fight
(That's the thing I love)
You been giving me one thing that's the way it is
And I really love it when you, what I mean is
You're so good I can't believe it
Ohh and I never get enough
Baby that's because
That's the thing I love

But I love when you're holding me
I love how it makes me feel
And I know you push me to the edge
Boy I love you so
And I love when you're touching me
I love how you make me feel
Even though you keep pushing the same old line
That's the thing I love

Its the 'making up for' line
Every time we fight
You be giving me one thing that's the way it is
And I really love it when you, what I mean is
You're so good I can't believe it
Ohhh and I never get enough
Baby that's because

That's the thing I love
(That's the thing, the thing I love)
Baby that's the thing, the thing I love
