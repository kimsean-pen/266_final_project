I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant
And Bel Air now

Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

I've seen the world, lit it up
As my stage now
Channeling angels in
The new age now

Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?

I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?

Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven
Please let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that you'll let him in
Father, tell me if you can

All that grace, all that body
All that face, makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine
Like diamonds

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?
I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I'm not young and beautiful?
