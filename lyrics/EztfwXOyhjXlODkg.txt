Does he know who you are?
Does he laugh, just to know
what he has?

Does he know not to talk
about your dad?
Does he know when you're sad?

You don't like to be touched
Let alone kissed.

Does he know where your lips begin?

Do you know who you are?
Do you laugh, just to think
what I lack?

Do you know your lip shakes
when you're mad?
And do you notice when you're sad?
You don't like to be touched
Let alone kissed.
Does his love make your head spin?
