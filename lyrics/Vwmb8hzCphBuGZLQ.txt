We aim to walk upon the future ground
When we talk we make the same sound
The cave echoes echoes desire through the crowd

Here we go again
Let's all let ourselves echo
Round and round again
Spinning in your head
Let's all let ourselves echo echo

Echo echo
Echo echo

I know it's bad, but it's good timing
I wanna be old because youth is sad
I count the minutes but I don't know why
Can I, can I get by as the future unwinds

Here we go again
Let's all let ourselves echo
Round and round again
Spinning in your head
Let's all let ourselves echo echo

Echo echo
Echo echo

We are golden stars above silver seas
We hear echoes from another galaxy

We are golden stars above silver seas
We hear echoes from another galaxy

Let's all let ourselves echo echo
Let's all let ourselves echo echo
Echo echo

We are golden stars above silver seas
We hear echoes from another galaxy

We are golden stars above silver seas
We hear echoes from another galaxy

All the echoes that confuse you
They all now ring true.
