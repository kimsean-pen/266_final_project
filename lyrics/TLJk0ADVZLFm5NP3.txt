Listen up, I'm gonna tell you a bit about myself
I got a situation, ain't concerning nobody else
Just you and what you can do for me
(Ooh)

I had the life of ordinary, I spat it out
Now my condition's kind of scary, I need you now
Not love but I need something else

So here's my confession
This time, this time
Don't just want you to love me

I want to be your attention
This time, this time
Want my name on the marquee

I want you
(To want me)
I want you
(To need me)
I want you
To hear my confession
I want to be your obsession, oh

I'll fake sick, shy until you never let me go
So I can be your addiction in the stereo
I could be just your type of high
(I can give what you like)

Your talkin' 'bout the narcissist
It means in Hollywood, I'm lovin' myself
The word I need for you to feel good
(Let's go)
Let the music just take control

So here's my confession
This time, this time
Don't just want you to love me

I want to be your attention
This time, this time
Want my name on the marquee

I want you
(To want me)
I want you
(To need me)
I want you
To hear my confession

I want to be your obsession
I want to be your obsession

Ain't nothing wrong with O.C.D.
Long as it's for me, long as it's for me
Ain't nothing wrong with O.C.D.
Long as it's for me, long as it's for me

So here's my, so here's my confession
This time, this time
Don't just want you to love me

I want to be your attention
This time, this time
Want my name on the marquee

I want you
(To want me)
I want you
(To need me)
I want you
To hear my confession

I want to be your obsession
I want to be your obsession
I want to be your obsession, oh
