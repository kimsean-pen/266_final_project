The cold winds blew into life, my adored
A bleeding heart we share, now on Azrael's wings

I fall like autumn rain...
You are my everything

This lovelorn kiss of death in lugubrious silence...
Dawn breaks open like a wound... and the dreadful sun

Two souls entwined together
Still so alone
Both you and I are shattered
And frozen in stone

You begged for air from within this cold tomb
With pain sharp as a knife
I now lie resting like a child on thy womb
Gave back a part of my life

For a while it had disappeared, but nothing was changed
A haze fell forever with her fading life
I leaned my head back... then drank of opaline
The emerald goddess came to me... she craved my soul
And just for a while... I had forgotten

Yes, it was all forgotten, but nothing was changed
Suddenly a cold breeze blew across our room...
It felt like I wanted to leave... this world with her

Come; drink with me the divine nectar of Olympus!
Sit beside me and help defy our adversity and loss...
This adversity and loss. It all ends with you!

I kiss you in your dying breath; sleeping quietly now
Swept away by heavy eyelids; forever in my dreams...
And you will be safe in my dearest dreams...
My love... forever in my dearest dreams
