I've forgotten what it feels like to feel normal
To be normal
And I've forgotten what food tastes like
The way it tastes right
The taste buds taste right
Well, I wake up in so much spit and sweat
It is not normal
What is normal?
Well, I go to bed
When I wake up
After cleaning all
All the spit and sweat

Now I'm, now
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
Now

I tossed and turned all night
'Cause I, 'cause I was looking for, for an ending
This was so because, because I watched all day
The Neverending Story with Atreyu

The next day came but not a beam of light
Because the blinds were shut
Sh-sh-sh-shut so tight

Well, I fell out of bed laced in spit and sweat

It made me very cold
It made me very cold

Now I'm, now
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin'

Well, I'm supposed to feel better
This nightmare's supposed to end

I am holdin' on
I am holdin' on
I am holdin' on
I am holdin' on

I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
Now, yeah, now, yeah

I'm shakin'
I'm shakin'
I'm shakin'
I'm shakin'
I'm shakin'
