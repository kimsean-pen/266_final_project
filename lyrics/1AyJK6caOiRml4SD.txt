Every day, you want me to make
Something I hate, all for your sake
I'm such a fake, I'm just a doll
I'm a rip-off
And it turns you on

Put on your clothes, then I
Polish my toes, then I
Powder my nose
In case you get close
(Get too close, baby)

Knock on your door, then I
Put on a show, then I
Gave you the floor
And you just froze

Every day, you want me to make
Something I hate, all for your sake
I'm such a fake, I'm just a doll
I'm a rip-off
And it turns you on

And it turns you on
And it turns you on
And it turns you on

Someone has to do it (Do it)
So I guess I will (Me!)
You want more influence, and I
I can be your flint
I can be your flint
I can be your flint (Can I be yours?)
I can be your boy

And it turns you on
And it turns you on
And it turns you on
And it turns you on
