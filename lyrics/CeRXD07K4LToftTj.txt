All my time passed me by like a stranger
Gravity pulled me down to the center
No, I couldn't see it
Oh, how could I sow what I couldn't find
And I couldn't feel it
A page folded over into the spine

But you won't realize 'til after it's happening, oh no
You'll never recognize 'til after it's coming on
Feel it, it's real
It's clear from far away
It's clear from far away

All my time passed me by like a stranger
Still I find I'm still looking for answers
No, I couldn't see it
Oh, how would I know what it said to me
And how could I feel it?
Sit down and descend, searching for a key

But you won't realize 'til after it's happening, oh no
You'll never recognize 'til after it's coming on
Feel it, it's real
But you won't realize 'til after it's happening, oh no
It's clear from far away
It's clear from far away
