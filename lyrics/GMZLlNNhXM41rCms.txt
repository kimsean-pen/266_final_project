A flickering candle, forlorn in the night
You wander in darkness
Can't shelter your light
But if you find me, we'll burn in the skies
Take my hand and dry your eyes

You and me against the world
They can't stop us now
You and me against the world
We'll make it somehow
Come with me, we're free like the wind
Breaking all the chains
It's you and me, you and me against the world

Too long we've been hiding
We shrouded in grey
And too many sunsets just faded away
No, they won't find us, together we'll fly
Under cover of the night

You and me against the world
They can't stop us now
You and me against the world
We'll make it somehow
Come with me, we're free like the wind
Breaking all the chains
It's you and me, you and me against the world

Against the world

You and me against the world
They can't stop us now
You and me against the world
We'll make it somehow
Come with me, we're free like the wind
Breaking all the chains
It's you and me, you and me against the world
