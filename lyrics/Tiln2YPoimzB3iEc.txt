Huge flowing movements
Crashing footsteps
Beautiful strangeness
Earth trembles
Forest edge trees in motion
Sun is gathered
Two hundred million years ago

Forest edge trees in motion
Sun is gathered
Two hundred million (years ago)
Huge flowing movements
Crashing footsteps
Beautiful strangeness
Earth trembles under forest edge

Come into vast open view with you
We see with love eyes our home for now
Turn in slow circles to see all around
