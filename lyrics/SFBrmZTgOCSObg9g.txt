I was happy in my harbor
When you cut me loose
Floating on an ocean and confused

Winds are whipping waves up like skyscrapers
And the harder they hit me
The less I seem to bruise

Oh, when I find the controls
I'll go where I like
I'll know where I want to be

But maybe for now I'll stay right here
On a silent sea
On a silent sea

I was happy in my harbor
When you cut me loose
Floating on an ocean and confused

Oh, when I find the controls
I'll go where I like
I'll know where I want to be

But maybe for now I'll stay right here
On a silent sea
On a silent sea

I'll stay right here
On a silent sea
On a silent sea

Oh, when I find the controls
I'll go where I like
I'll know where I want to be

But maybe for now I'll stay right here
On a silent sea
