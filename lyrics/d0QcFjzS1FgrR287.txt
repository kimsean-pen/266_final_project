Maybe I got it wrong
How do I turn you off
Cause now you're out my reach
Maybe I played too safe
How do I pull away
Am I to blinded to see
I've been hoping you catch up somehow
Like I'm way too far ahead
Every time I think I'm gaining ground
I'm misunderstood again

I thought that I said it
In the things that I didn't say
I thought that you felt it
In the games that I didn't play
So let the record show
I never let you go
Can we get back on track
Oh
I thought that I said it

In the things that I didn't say

In the things that I didn't say

In the things that I didn't say
What if I shout it out
What if I take a vow
When you think it's too much
What do you want from me
Thought that I was going deep

Guess it was never enough
I've been hoping you catch up somehow
Like I'm way too far ahead
Every time I think I'm gaining ground

I'm misunderstood again
I thought that I said it
In the things that I didn't say
I thought that you felt it
In the games that I didn't play
So let the record show
I never let you go
Can we get back on track
Oh

I thought that I said it

In the things that I didn't say

In the things that I didn't say
In the things that I didn't say
I thought I told you

I thought I told you
I thought I told you
I thought that I said it
In the things that I didn't say
I thought that you felt it
In the games that I didn't play
So let the record show
I never let you go
Can we get back on track
Oh
I thought that I said it
In the things that I didn't say
In the things that I didn't say
In the things that I didn't say
