Red hot iron heated by living coal
Ready for branding to strike his goal
The torrid cast iron marks the leather
To banish the renegade from now on forever

Many relocated all across the land
Together we've got the power in our hands
We're strong enough to fight mendacious laws
We've got the wrath, 'cause we are
Branded & exiled
Together we can stand the night

Rabbits would sink into the morass of unjustice
They try to deliver it from the deep black abyss
Our shell of wrath explodes, they're winding like an ill
That day we're ready to make those bastards kneel

Many relocated all across the land
Together we've got the power in our hands
We're strong enough to fight mendacious laws
We've got the wrath, 'cause we are
Branded & exiled
Together we can stand the night
