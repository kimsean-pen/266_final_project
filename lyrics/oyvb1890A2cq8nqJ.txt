I always felt uneasy when we weren't in the same place
Taken back by the feeling that this could all go away
She said "Baby I would never do what those girls do"
Funny how I'd only hear that when it benefitted you

Did I get too close?
Didn't mean to have your true colors exposed

Wait, did you ever take a moment just to think
About anyone, anyone other than yourself?
Give me back the love I wasted now
Cold, one day it's gonna hit you you're alone
I won't be there, won't be there
It's cruel to turn around
Give me back the love I wasted now

It's your eyes that told me you were in it
All the flags that were red I told myself they were tinted
Then I noticed that you couldn't stand the sight of your own shadow
Like the devil on your shoulder couldn't stand to wait much longer

Did I get too close?
Didn't mean to have your true colors exposed
Imperfections start to show
That's when I wanted you more

Wait, did you ever take a moment just to think
About anyone, anyone other than yourself?
Give me back the love I wasted now
Cold, one day it's gonna hit you you're alone
I won't be there, won't be there
It's cruel to turn around
Give me back the love I wasted now

Give me back the love I wasted now
Now, now

Wait, did you ever take a moment just to think
About anyone, anyone other than yourself?
Give me back the love I wasted now
Cold, one day it's gonna hit you you're alone
I won't be there, won't be there
It's cruel to turn around
Give me back the love I wasted now
