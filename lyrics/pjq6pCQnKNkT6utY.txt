Hollow ground and I keep on falling
Breathing in, but it's not enough
When I drown my eyes in the river flowing
You said you'd stay just a little more

Cause the faith isn't gone, I still hear it calling
But something is wrong, teardrops are falling
But just before they hit the ground
Oh, when I hear you say
Oh, when I hear you say

Dont give it up, don't give it up, it's glorious
Don' give it up, don't give it up, it's glorious
But I can't help it, oh, I can't help it
Don't wanna stay, I'll run away
No I can't help it, oh, I can't help it

I close my eyes and I feel your heartbeat
A deep blue sea rushes over me
And when the thunder cries, I feel the warmth around me
Cause I found a place underneath your heart

Cause the faith isn't gone, I still hear it calling
But something is wrong, teardrops are falling
But just before they hit the ground
Oh, when I hear you say
Oh, when I hear you say

Dont give it up, don't give it up, it's glorious
Don' give it up, don't give it up, it's glorious
But I can't help it, oh, I can't help it
Don't wanna stay, I'll run away
No I can't help it, oh, I can't help it

When the time is right and there's no way out
And I ain't losing something I ain't got
When the love has gone, when I'm all alone
I'll give it everything, I'll give it everything now
When the time is right and there's no way out
I'll give it everything, I'll give it everything now

When the time is right and there's no way out
And I ain't losing something I ain't got
When the love has gone, when I'm all alone
I'll give it everything, I'll give it everything now
When the time is right and there's no way out
I'll give it everything, I'll give it everything now

When the time is right and there's no way out
And I ain't losing something I ain't got
When the love has gone, when I'm all alone
I'll give it everything, I'll give it everything now
When the time is right and there's no way out
I'll give it everything, I'll give it everything now
