Heaven is mine, seems I've been losing my time
The silence warns and prevents me from crying
My deserts are green, and the tales are true
That's where I wanna keep my lovin' for you
Angels whisper something unreal
They put me up to a place of heal
Come into my dream
Let me show you where I've been
It's you and me I've seen
Let me tell you what I mean
In the deep blue sky
There were rainbows in the night
You, and me could fly
And the ocean shines so bright
Come into my dream
Come into my dream (to my dream)
It's you and me I've seen (me I've seen)
In the deep blue sky (deep blue sky)
You, and me could fly (me could fly)
And the ocean shines so bright
Heaven is mine, seems I've been losing my time
The silence warns and prevents me from crying
My deserts are green, and the tales are true
That's where I wanna keep my lovin' for you
Angels whisper something unreal
They put me up to a place of heal
Come into my dream
Let me show you where I've been
It's you and me I've seen
Let me tell you what I mean
In the deep blue sky
There were rainbows in the night
You, and me could fly
And the ocean shines so bright
Come into my dream
Come into my dream (to my dream)
It's you and me I've seen (me I've seen)
In the deep blue sky (deep blue sky)
You, and me could fly (me could fly)
And the ocean shines so bright (shines so bright)
