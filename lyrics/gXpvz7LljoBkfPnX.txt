Its a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world.
Was I born as a promise to keep the peace
Or meet the shame
Before you split, one thing left
To give me my ordinary name
Give me my ordinary name
Now that Im still standing,
Ive got something left to prove
Got a bullet left, but I cant decide
Which scorpion Im going to shoot
Will it be me, will it be you?
Its a bad man's world
Its a bad man's world
Im a bad, bad girl
Its a bad man's world

I will never forgive you
For what you put us kids through
Remember that night
You tried to take your own life?
When I found you
You were a shade of blue
Success is a state of mind
With a little bit of follow through
And then you failed at that, too
Its a bad mans world
Its a bad mans world
Im a bad, bad girl
Its a bad mans world

Will it be me, will it be you?
Its a bad man's world
Its a bad man's world
Im a bad, bad girl
Its a bad mans world Its a bad man's world

Was I born as a promise to keep the peace
Or meet the shame
Before you split, one thing left
To give me ordinary name
Give me my ordinary name
Now that Im still standing,
Ive got something left to prove
Got a bullet left, but I cant decide
Which scorpion Im going to shoot
Will it be me, will it be you?
Its a bad man's world
Its a bad man's world
Im a bad, bad girl
Its a bad man's world

I will never forgive you
For what you put us kids through
Remember that night
You tried to take your own life?
When I found you
You were a shade of blue
Success is a state of mind
With a little bit of follow through
And then you failed at that, too
Its a bad mans world
Its a bad mans world
Im a bad, bad girl
Its a bad mans world

Will it be me, will it be you?
Its a bad man's world
Its a bad man's world
Im a bad, bad girl
Its a bad mans world
