Dark bodies floating in darkness
No sign of light ever given
Imprisoned in a world without a memory
Unconscious or am I conscious?
Cut from the heart I am part of
Sometimes I feel as though I'm frozen in Heaven

And I saw my own face in the dark and loneliness
And I saw my own face like a spark frozen in Heaven

In dreams I see myself flying
Closer to the sun and I'm climbing
Tried to touch the sun
But the brightness burned my eyes
Unconscious or am I conscious?
Fell from the sky like a star
Sometimes I feel as though I'm frozen in Heaven

And I saw my own face in the dark and loneliness
And I saw my own face like a spark

Dark! dark! dark!
My life was so dark! dark! dark!
My mind was so dark! dark! dark!
My life was so dark! dark! dark!
Everything was! (dark)

Unconscious or am I conscious?
Fell from the sky like a star
Sometimes I feel as though I'm frozen in Heaven

And I saw my own face in the dark and loneliness
And I saw my own face like a spark frozen in Heaven

Dark bodies floating in darkness!
Dark bodies floating in darkness!
Dark bodies floating in darkness!
Dark bodies floating in darkness!
Dark bodies floating in darkness!
Dark bodies floating in darkness!
Dark bodies floating in darkness!
