I am waiting for your love
missing faces in my room.
I am waiting for your love
lie looking at the moon.
Emotional.
Devotional.
Give me the greatest love
something there is in the heaven
sometimes I just can'T hide
why can'T we live together now.
I am waiting for your love
we're playing silly games.
I am waiting for your love
let me standing in the rain.
Emotional.
Devotional.
Give me the greatest love
something there is in heaven
sometimes I just can hide
why can we live together now.
Emotional.
Devotional.
Give me the greatest love
something there is in heaven
sometimes I just can hide
why can we live together now.
I am waiting for your love
I am waiting for your love
I am waiting for your love
I am waiting for your love
I am waiting for your love
I am waiting for your love
