It wasn't her fault
She makes sugar taste like salt
Cause she was so sweet
Now you're shuffling your feet with your hands in your pockets
It wasn't her fault
She made sugar taste like salt
And when she walked in the room
You could hear your eyes rolling round in their sockets

Their sockets, their sockets, their sockets!
She doesn't know if it's a blessing or a curse
Money in her hand but never any in her purse
Looking at the crowd thinking "who's it gonna be?
Who's the lucky boy that's gonna quench my thirst?"
It wasn't her fault that she didn't have a say
Spending every second wishing they would go away
Tying up my shoes is becoming a problem
But that's the way it is and that's the way it's gonna stay
It wasn't her fault
She made sugar taste like salt
Cause she was so sweet
Now you're shuffling your feet with your hands in your pockets
It wasn't her fault
She made sugar taste like salt
And when she walked in the room
You could hear your eyes rolling round in their sockets
Their sockets, their sockets, their sockets!
You can point the finger but she's not the one to blame
For chemical reactions that are starting in your brain
Looking at the crowd thinking "who's it gonna be?
Who's the lucky boy that's gonna ease my pain?"
It wasn't her fault that she didn't have a say
Spending every second wishing they would go away
Tying up my shoes is becoming a problem
But that's the way it is and that's the way it's gonna stay
It wasn't her fault
She made sugar taste like salt
Cause she was so sweet
Now you're shuffling your feet with your hands in your pockets
It wasn't her fault
She made sugar taste like salt
And when she walked in the room
You could hear your eyes rolling round in their sockets
Their sockets, their sockets, their sockets!

It wasn't her fault!
It wasn't her fault!
It wasn't her fault!
It wasn't her fault!
It wasn't her fault!
It wasn't her fault!
It wasn't her fault!
That you could hear your eyes rolling round in their sockets
