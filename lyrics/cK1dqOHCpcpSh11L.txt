Yep, O.K. Noel

But I tried and I sighed
He didn't listen to me, I felt that way
Still I tried and I sighed
He wouldn't understand me, I felt that way
But you're so young and you don't get me now
I feel so guilty, and you are chocolate brown

Chocolate brown, I can't play
Not too long, I will make it up to you
Chocolate brown

Still I learn, and I learn
There's so much to think about you
So much to lose
But it's just fine, and you don't see it now
Don't make me guilty
Please, don't chocolate brown

Chocolate brown, I can't play
Not too long, I will make it up to you
Chocolate brown
Chocolate brown
Chocolate brown
Chocolate brown
