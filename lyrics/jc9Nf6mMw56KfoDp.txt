My eyelids float
Between two states
On the borderline
Flows a slow intake
They don't let much in
I don't let much out
Just a broken bulb
Flickering with doubt

Yeah, it happens all the time

Misery loves me
But I don't love her
It's a one-way street
Circling planet earth
If I take a right
Maybe I'll outrun
To the great unknown
Goes the great no one

Yeah, it happens all the time
Yeah, it happens all the time

Wanna move, I do I do I do
I'm trying to get this right
But I'm losing the appetite
It's not the way I'd choose I'd choose I'd choose
Always caught in between
The ache and the apathy

If there is a record
For most hours wasted
Least worthy reason
To cry on a Thursday evening
I'm in the lead

Yeah, it happens all the time
Yeah, it happens all the time

Wanna move, I do I do I do
I'm trying to get this right
But I'm losing the appetite
It's not the way I'd choose I'd choose I'd choose
Always caught in between
The ache and the apathy

Staring up at the stars at night
I know their light is so behind the times
The more I live in the world
I find
Seclusion's pleasing
Is an illusion

Wanna move, I do I do I do
I'm trying to get this right
But I'm losing the appetite
It's not the way I'd choose I'd choose I'd choose
Always caught in between
Always caught in between
