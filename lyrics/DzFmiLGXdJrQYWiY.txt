Come on by my side
Come on both sides
Come on by my side
Come on both sides

Step out of the shadows
said the children to their saint

you create these zombies
just to keep them from their fate

no communication as the masses
cheat and steal

stars and constellations
now I notice who you are

Come on by my side
Come on both sides
Come on by my side
Come on both sides
come on.

No retaliation
said the poets to his kid

separate the idols
and commit your deadly sin

And all this put aside,
wanna finish what you start

I'll connect the numbers
you protect my heart

Come on by my side
Come on both sides
Come on by my side
Come on both sides

No communication
from the poets to his kin

separate the idols
and commit your deadly sin

no communication
wanna finish what you start

I'll connect the numbers
You protect my heart.

Come on by my side.
Come on both sides.
Come on by my side.
Come on both sides.
