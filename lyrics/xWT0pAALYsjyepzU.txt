You don't care about the road
The one that lead us to the places we know
A road of promises we made
There's just nothing left to hold

Feels like you just keep on pulling me down
Sometimes I fall without making a sound
Will it ever be the same again?
It took me to long to take the blame

Dark, so dark are all my reasons
And in your bed I toss and turn
My love has grown
Like a vine around my throat

Feels like you just keep on pulling me down
Sometimes I fall without making a sound
Will it ever be the same again?
It took me to long to take the blame

Love, love, lost its way
Love (love) love, lost its way
Love (love) love, lost her way
Love (love) love
She lost her way
She lost the way
My baby, maybe you'll come back again another day
Until then, I'll just hope and pray
