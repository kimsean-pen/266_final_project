It hurts to be dancing round your telephone
Wondering if she's at home doing the same dance
And you pass the time for an hour or two
Wishing he was holding you with both hands

But no matter who let the phone ring
There's no reason to be leaving you guessing
No matter who got you down
Even the weakest of the weak have come around
No matter who

Our fearless beginning and the tragic end
For two lovers, but not two friends
Hello regret
You're thanking God above
That you've been loved
While wishing you had never met

But no matter who let the phone ring
There's no reason to be leaving you guessing
No matter who got you down
Even the weakest of the weak have come around
No matter who

Oh if I understand
How the heart behaves
If you could see that man
I know you'd say

Still in love
I'm still in love
Are you?

Still in love
I'm still in love
Are you
