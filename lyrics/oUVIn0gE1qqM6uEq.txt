Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally
'Cause I'm every woman (Every woman)
It's all in me
It's all in me
Yeah

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every woman, whoever made ya say...
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa (oh) whoa (oh) whoa

I can cast a spell
See, but you can't tell
Mix a special groove
Put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Then instantly
I will appear
Yeah oh

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

I can set your knees
like playing unto the seas
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some little flash of love
I got it, I got it
I got it, got it, baby baby

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every woman, whoever made ya say...
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

I ain't braggin'
'Cause I'm the one
Just ask me
Oh, it shall be done
And don't bother
to compare
I've got it

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Ahhhhh

I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman

I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman

I'm every woman (Chaka)
I'm every woman (Chaka)
I'm every woman (Ha ha ha)
I'm every woman (Come on girl)
