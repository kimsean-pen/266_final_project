Lately I'm getting better.
Wish I could stay sick with you,
But there's too many egos left to bruise.
Call it sin, you call it whatever.
Eating deep inside of you.
Well if it were me, It's all I'd ever do.

Steal me now and forever.
I'll steal something good for you,
The criminal in me is no one new.
'Till you find something better.
When there's nothing left to use,
And everything starts going down on you.

I'm the Generator, firing whenever you quit
Yeah, whatever it is, you go out and it's on.
Yeah, can't you hear my motored heart?
You're the one who started it.

Send me out on a tether.
Swing it 'round, I'll spin your noose.
You let it down, I'll hang around with you.
'Till you find someone better.
When there's no one left to lose,
And everyone keeps going down.

I'm the Generator, firing whenever you quit
Yeah, whatever it is, you go out and it's on.
Yeah, can't you hear my motored heart?
You're the one who started it.

I'm the Generator, firing whenever you quit
Yeah, whatever it is, you go out and it's on.
Yeah, can't you hear my motored heart?
You're the one that started it.

I'm the Generator. I'm the Generator.
I'm the Generator. I'm the Generator.
'Im the Generator. I'm the Generator.
Yeah, can't you hear my motored heart?
You're the one who started it.
