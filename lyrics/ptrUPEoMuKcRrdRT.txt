Holy Father in Darkness
Hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom came
The rise of Thy reign

The bloom of the silvern night
Hail King of Antumnos

Holy Father in Darkness
Thy will was done
When the gates of Antumnos
Were opened wide

From Thy bosom
Arose in glory
The children of the Otherworld

You are the nameless
You're the primordial one
Who was, who is and is to come
Senisteros
You are my genesis

A rose e'er blooming
From noble stem
Hath sprung the tribes
Of the night born

Holy Father in Darkness
Bright sun of the night
Thine is the power and the glory
Forever more

Holy Father in Darkness
Blessed be Thy name
Thy kingdom came
The rise of Thy reign
From Thy bosom
Arose in glory
The children of the Otherworld
You are the nameless
You're the primordial one
Who was, who is and is to come
Senisteros
You are my genesis
A blossom (...?)
So envied it took words of her wise
He, who has ears to hear
Let him hear
