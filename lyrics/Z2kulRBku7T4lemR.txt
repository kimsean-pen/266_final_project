I had it all planned out before you met me
Was gonna leave early and so swiftly
Maybe in a fire or crash off a ravine
People would weep, "How tragic, so early"

I was gonna die young
Now I gotta wait for you, honey
Now I gotta wait for you, honey
Now I gotta wait for you, honey

I was a firecracker, baby, with something to prove
Now I gotta contend with the living blues
I could've missed it, and never knew
Chain reaction, but you're holding the fuse

I was gonna die young
Now I gotta wait for you, honey
Now I gotta wait for you, honey
Now I gotta wait for you, honey

Oooh, I don't mind
I've got the fire, electric life, so high, so wild
It's not like I chose, not like I tried
But now I gotta wait around and watch you burn so bright

I was gonna die
I had it all planned out before you met me
I had a plan, you ruined it completely
Had it all planned out before you met me
I had a plan, you...

I was gonna die young
Now I gotta wait for you, honey
Now I gotta wait for you, honey
Now I gotta wait for you, honey

I was gonna die young
Now I gotta wait for you, honey
Now I gotta wait for you, honey
Now I gotta wait for you, honey
(Ohh yeah, yeah, yeah)

Had it all planned out before you met me
I had a plan, you ruined it completely
Had it all planned out before you met me
I had a plan, you ruined it completely
