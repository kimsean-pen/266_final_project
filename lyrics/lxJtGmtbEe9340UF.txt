Hey I know, hey I know, hey I know
Fuck you want?
Hey

I'm tryna catch a wave, these bitches know the way
These trappers see the way, it's all up in my way
These niggas in the way, I'm survin' it away
I'm surfin' in a wave
These bitches know to wait, you trappers know to wave
Real niggas know to weigh, you prolly not on the wave
I'm Gucci in a wave, I'm Louie in a wave
I'm surfin' on a wave
Aye, surf's up, nigga
Surf Club, nigga, ya'
Don't touch, nigga

Pullin' up in the Gucci store
Spendin' like a nigga got money
Tell the guard block off the door
6 months I'm on the Forbes'
Headed downtown with a Boujee
Hoping that the bands go boozie
Pull up in that DOC, tell that bitch "Hop out the roof" (juice)
Tell that bitch you in denial, tell a bitch check on my file
Tell that bitch I am the man, I been the man since a child
I know I got it for now, swallow so I know you down
She put it all in her mouth, and still don't know how it's pronounced

Baby you fit like a diamond, is you lit
Trap don't ever die, now is you ready for me?
Every fucking time I get it wet, God's ain't ever lie
Now is you ready for me?

These bitches know to wait, you trappers know to wave
Real niggas know to weigh, you prolly not on the wave
I'm Guccin' away, I'm Louien' away
I'm surfin' on a wave
Aye, surf's up, nigga
Surf Club, nigga, ya
Don't touch, nigga

Bottles on, bottles on, bottles my nigga
She said, "I been trappin' like that shit religious"
I said, "I'm goin' too hard, please forgive her"
You know there's no love, 'cause my heart just tuned in December
I need a Porsche, fit at least 10 bitches inside
I need a crib, only lingerie models get invited
I need Megan Good, know she taken, keep in mind
I won't tell nobody though, keep it so private aye
You know I got niggas to do it, when I took a different approach
Ten thousand feet in the air when I swear I look different in coach
Good thing you started a wave my nigga, I live on a boat
I put my finger in the air, when they ask me to give them a quote

Baby you fit like a diamond, is you lit
Trap don't ever die, now is you ready for me?
Every fucking time I get it wet, God's ain't ever lie
Now is you ready for me?

These bitches know to wait, you trappers know to wave
Real niggas know to weigh, you prolly not on the wave
I'm Guccin' away, I'm Louien' away
I'm surfin' on a wave
Aye, surf's up, nigga
Surf Club, nigga, ya
Don't touch, nigga

If you wanna go get a scooter
Baby this is drugs but it's true love, I shine like a diamond
You don't wanna' find us
