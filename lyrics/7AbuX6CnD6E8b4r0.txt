I dream about your car
I dream inside my room
Afraid of you finding out

And you sat closer, then next to me
Icebreaker

I need to feel you always

And you sat closer, then next to me
Icebreaker

You tell me I'm a god
When we never talk
I really slipped hard for you

Icebreaker

I need to feel you always
