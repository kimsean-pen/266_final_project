Stand beside it
We can't hide the way it makes us glow
It's no good unless it grows
Feel this burning love of mine

Deep inside the ever-spinning
Tell me, does it feel?
It's no good unless it's real
Hillsides burning, wild-eyed turning
Till we're running from it

I'd take care of you
If you'd ask me to
In a year or two
Oh

You say swimming in the lake
We'll come across a snake
It is real and then it's fake
Feel its heartbeat
Feel what you heat
Far so fast it feels too late

I'd take care of you
If you'd ask me to
In a year or two
Oh

I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
