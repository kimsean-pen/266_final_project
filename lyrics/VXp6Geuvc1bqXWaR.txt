Silently moving in the snow covered mountains of North
Krieg—and the whispering cold winds
of death, in the snow covered mountains of North
Freedom, through the memories buried by time

Silently moving in the snow covered mountains of North
Cries—death will set me free,
in the snow covered mountains of North
Quietly breathing—knowing this is the
day when our fire burns brighter than yours

Memories fading
Bloodthirst and truth

Black wings and withering gloom
And bloody broken feet
In the throes of war with unscarred youth
Death takes no prisoners
Blood back to earth

Silently--in the snow covered mountains of North

Memories fading
Bloodthirst and truth

Black wings and withering gloom
And bloody broken feet
In the throes of war with unscarred youth
Death takes no prisoners
Blood back to earth

No Triumph or glory
in the painful suffering of loss
No victor or king
Just the bloosoaked armour of Tyr
Set me free
From the misery distorting my mind
No triumph or glory, no victor or king
Just the bloosoaked armour of Tyr

Black wings and withering gloom
And bloody broken feet
In the throes of war with unscarred youth
Death takes no prisoners
Blood back to earth

Ashes to ashes
and dust to dust
No son forsaken
but many forgotten
Their names written in the sand

Black wings and withering gloom
And bloody broken feet

Silently--knowing this is our fate
in the snow covered mountains of North
