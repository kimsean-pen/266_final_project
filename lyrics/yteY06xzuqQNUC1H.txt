To my UFO friend
Goodbye, goodbye, like a seed in the wind
She's taking up root in the sky
See her flickering
Her system won't even try
To defend and ripen in the radio action

She'll never return again
Polarize, polarize, the seasons will bend
There'll soon be proof that there is no alien
Just a system of truth and lies
The reason, the language and the law of attraction

Just like a bad dream you'll disappear
Another map turns blue
Mirror on mirror
And I imagine you taking me outta here
To deepen our love it isn't even a fraction

Switch to another lens
The last sunlight
I don't need any other friends
The best kiss I ever had is the flickering
Of the water so clear and bright
To leap in, my skin and I could feel the reaction

Just like a bad dream you'll disappear
Another map turns blue
Mirror on mirror
And I imagine you taking me outta here
To deepen our love it isn't even a fraction

Just like a bad dream you'll disappear
Another map turns blue
Mirror on mirror
And I imagine you taking me outta here
To deepen our love it isn't even a fraction
