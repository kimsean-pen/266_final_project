Waiting for the dawn
Waiting for the night
Waiting for the dawn
Waiting for the night

The day's too long
The day's too bright
The day's too long
The day's too bright

Love me,
love me to the end
this man pursues you
a dagger in his hands
this man pursues you
a dagger in his hands

Yet he will never
get into our land
Yet he will never
get into our land

Love me,
love me to the end

Fall down by my side
down in my arms
fall down by my side
down in my arms
this night forever
no morning will come
this night forever
no morning will come

Love me,
love me to the end
Love me,
love me to the end
Love me, love me...
