Girl
You lived your life like a sleeping swan
Your time has come
To go deeper

Girl
The final journey has just begun
Your destiny
Chose the reaper

No fear
Destination darkness
No fear
Destination darkness
No fear

Girl
Rain falls down from the northern skies
Like poisoned knives
With no mercy

Girl
Close your eyes for the one last time
Sleepless nights
From here to eternity

No fear
Destination darkness
No fear
Destination darkness
No fear

(Destination darkness)
(Destination darkness)

Ooooh
No fear
Destination darkness
No fear
Destination darkness
Ooooh
No fear
Destination darkness
No fear
Destination darkness
No fear
