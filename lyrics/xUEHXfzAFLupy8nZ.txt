Get off the car
Kick his chain
Kick his pride
Get him soaked hit run

Lift up your toes
In my mouth
And we can make love
And we can go
And we can go
And we can go

We're covered by the sacred fire
When you come to me
You come to me broke

Get off the car
Kick his chain
Kick his pride
Get him soaked hit run

Lift up your toes
In my mouth
And we can make love
And we can go

And we can go
And we can go
And we can go
And we can go

We're covered by the sacred fire
When you come to me
You come to me broke

Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt

Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt

Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt

We're covered by the sacred fire
When you come to me
You come to me broke

Guilty girl, guilty boy
Get to make out
Him chocked with mousse

Lift up your toes
In my mouth
And we can make love
And we can go

Guilty girl, guilty boy
Get to make out
Him chocked with mousse

Lift up your toes
In my mouth
And we can make love
And we can go
