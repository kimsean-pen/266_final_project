Bang!
Explosions in my head that just won't quit
A train has crashed into the wall around my heart and left the old me dead
Obliterated
Stop!
My breathing in the night when you're not there
The silence ringing through my ears and all I want to do is hear your voice
But you're not there

Drawn together
Painter's brush stroke
Sleight of hand we, we won't go up in smoke
Fates colliding
Love undying

Like the rising tide
Beating hearts grow but never die
To simplify, I'll stand by your side
Close my eyes, hope will never die
Like the rising tide
Beating hearts grow but never die
To simplify, I'll stand by your side
Close my eyes, hope will never die

Go!
And take away the pain of being me
Soothe my soul caress my heart and end my fear all my bad memories
Eradicated
Ring!
Like gunshots heard against a silent night
My love is louder than these words they're stronger than the rest unstoppable
Unstoppable

Drawn together
Painter's brush stroke
Sleight of hand we, we won't go up in smoke
Fates colliding
Love undying

Like the rising tide
Beating hearts grow but never die
To simplify, I'll stand by your side
Close my eyes, hope will never die
Like the rising tide
Beating hearts grow but never die
To simplify, I'll stand by your side
Close my eyes, hope will never die
Will never die

Die
Drawn together
Painter's brush stroke
Sleight of hand we, we won't go up in smoke
Fates colliding
Love undying

Like the rising tide
Beating hearts grow but never die
To simplify, I'll stand by your side
Close my eyes, hope will never die
Like the rising tide
Beating hearts grow but never die
To simplify, I'll stand by your side
Close my eyes, hope will never die
Will never die
Die
