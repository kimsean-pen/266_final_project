Why do these cold stars burn bright?
All these cold stars
Why do these cold stars burn bright?
All these cold stars
Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
Nothing will stop me
Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
Nothing will stop me
Still the world keeps spinning around you
Heaven knows we're drifting apart
All the burning buildings surround you
All the world is falling down
All the world is falling down
Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
Nothing will stop me
Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
Nothing will stop me
Underneath the shooting stars
Fireworks tearing us apart
Tiny sparks and broken hearts
Bruised and bleeding broken hearts
Hopelessness turned to despair
Shattered glass lies everywhere
Flying form the deadly blast
Armageddon's come at last
Bring it on (bring it on)
Bring it on (bring it on)
Bring it on(bring it on)
Bring it on (bring it on)
Bring it on (bring it on)
Bring it on (bring it on)
Bring it on (bring it on)
Bring it on (bring it on)
Bring it on (bring it on)
Bring it on (bring it on)
Bring
Bring it on
Bring it on
