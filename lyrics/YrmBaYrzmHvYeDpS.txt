Won't someone tell me what is happenin' to me?
Why am I so misunderstood?
Why can't they see?
Now I'm caught between the devil and the angel
That I used to be

They say I'll understand it all in good time
But age ain't nothin' but a number in my mind
I'm going crazy with this push me pull me
Caught between wrong and right

I wanna give in to the woman in me
I wanna be someone they don't want me to be
The moral of the story is I got no choice
I must not chase the boys

I started writing down my deepest secrets
Seven days a week of truth and fantasy
Got the feelin' that the way my life is
Got to be prepared for changes

Won't someone tell me what is happenin' to me?
Why am I so misunderstood?
Why can't they see?
Now I'm caught between the devil and the angel
That I used to be

I wanna give in to the woman in me
I wanna be someone they don't want me to be
The moral of the story is I got no choice
I must not chase
I wanna go left but they tell me go right
Don't wanna be the little girl they're kissin' goodnight
The moral of the story is I got no choice
I must not chase the boys

They can try to make me write a thousand lies
But that won't ever change the way I feel inside
They've got their opinions but I just don't care
'Cause that's not what I wanna hear

I, I must, I must not chase the boys
I, I must, I must not chase the boys
I must, I must, I must not chase the boys

I wanna give in to the woman in me
I wanna be someone they don't want me to be
The moral of the story is I got no choice
I must not chase
I wanna go left but they tell me go right
Don't wanna be the little girl they're kissin' goodnight
The moral of the story is I got no choice
I must not chase the boys
