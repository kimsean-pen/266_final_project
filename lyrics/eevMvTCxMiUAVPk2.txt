Let you free
I don't know because
You already have me

Let you lose yourself
Like purple rain
How can I find myself this way?

Tchu bee doo bee doo
I'm listening to the movement that starts at the right time
Telling my soul a secret, like it never happened before
My grandmother told me that now I'm mature
I'm trying to understand it, but these stupid things
Tchu bee doo bee doo
Make me irrational
I see a man, spinning like crazy
My mind is full of corny chords
Why drugs, when people can just smoke love?

Tchu bee doo bee doo
I'm listening to the movement that starts at the right time
Telling my soul a secret, like it never happened before
My grandmother told me that now I'm mature
I'm trying to understand it, but these stupid things
Tchu bee doo bee doo
Make me irrational
Why am I seeing these things?
Oh, is it because
The stupid things I never thought
Bee doo bee doo
I never thought
I could like
How can I feel like a queen
And let it go, let it die
I'm so sorry but I insist
You are mine
