Is this disguise, is this diguise
going to play out?
How many times, how many times,
we had laid out?
You can't decide how to divide
what you laid out.
And all the lines you drew

that you thought out.
It's no surprise, your shaking eyes
get you caught out,
A little time, a little time
and it's alright.
And all the lines you drew
you didn't find what you
set out to, set out to, set out to,
