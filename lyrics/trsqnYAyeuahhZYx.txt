When I dare close my eyes
I feel the vibrant morning rise
On the shores of that dear and secret island

I've waited for to long
To join you where true love belongs
Let's embark on a journey back to our land

Leave the world behind this once in a lifetime
Our compass will reveal the place where "us" is real

Sailing the sea where our legend will live
All our stories and memories are mine to believe
Walking there, hand in hand
As kings of our own land
Our return to Lemuria

Until the day has come I wish to stay with you alone
But I dread that you'll leave without a warning

I hear your words my dear inside I share this deepest fear
But we know there will dawn a darker morning

Leave the world behind this once in a lifetime
Our compass will reveal the place where "us" is real

Sailing the sea where our legend will live
All our stories and memories are mine to believe
Walking there, hand in hand
As kings of our own land
Our return to Lemuria

Leave the world behind this once in a lifetime
Our compass will reveal the place where "us" is real

Sailing the sea where our legend will live
All our stories and memories are mine to believe
Walking there, hand in hand
As kings of our own land
Our return to Lemuria

Holding you in my heart
As we sail apart
End the dream called Lemuria
