Standing on the same road again
Sister's in the master bedroom
Time to dig that hole again
You have the tools but you did not choose them
You are a cutlass cruiser
I'm just a part-time loser now
Do you take scars or bruises?
All have proof that we struggled somehow

We all know our troubles will end
Why'd you have to go and make illusion your friend?
I can see him chasing you around your head
Come on, everybody saw it sooner
You don't really think you're that good, do you?

You really feel all alone again
Need a glass of something to soothe you
Time to make that soul whole again
But the carpet on the wall is moving
You're all footloose and woozy
You could walk but you better sit now
I don't want to talk down to you
I feel the same, much of the time anyhow

We all know our troubles will end
Why'd you have to go and make illusion your friend?
I can see him chasing you around your head
Come on, everybody saw it sooner
You don't really think you're that good, do you?
Come on, everybody saw it sooner
You don't really think you're that good, do you?
That good, do you?

There are many women
Three or two are better
Girls look good together
Ask any man, he'll tell ya

We all know our troubles will end
Why'd you have to go and make illusion your friend?
I can see him chasing you around your head
Come on, everybody saw it sooner
You don't really think you're that good, do you?
Come on, everybody saw it sooner
You don't really think you're that good, do you?
That good, do you?
That good, do you?
