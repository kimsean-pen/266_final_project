Hmmm
Hmmmm
All my life i waited for the right
Moment to let you know
I don't wanna let you go
But now i realize there's just no perfect time
To confess how i feel
This much i know is real
So i refuse to waste one more second

Without you knowing my heart
Baby, 'cause i don't need anything else but your love
Nothing but you means a thing to me, i'm incomplete
When you're not there, holding me, touching me

I swear all of the rest could just disappear
And I wouldn't even care, as long as you're there
Take these words
Don't let them go unheard

This is me reaching out
I hope you can hear me now
'Cause baby, my heart says stay
Take it, it's yours to break

I'd rather try and lose
Than keep this love from you
Yeahhh
So I refuse to waste one more second
Without you knowing my heart
Baby, 'cause i don't need anything else but your love
Nothing but you means a thing to me, i'm incomplete

When you're not there, holding me, touching me

I swear all of the rest could just disappear
And I wouldn't even care, as long as you're there

Each day and night that i kept this a secret
It killed me, it's time to share what i feel inside
Oh, I don't need anything else but your love
Nothing but you means a thing to me, i'm incomplete
When you're not there, holding me, touching me
I swear all of the rest could just disappear
And I wouldn't even care, as long as you're there
