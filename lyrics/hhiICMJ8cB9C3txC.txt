Is six afraid of seven, 'cause seven eight nine?
I'm about to lose it a second time
Staring at the wall, hour after hour
Running up and down, over and over

It's so tricky tricky, this little one too,
Well, if it is a lunatic we'll name it after you.
Put it in your pocket and pick it up
We're here to entertain, show them what you got.

Six afraid of seven, 'cause seven eight nine
I'm afraid of losing the places I find
If I was made equal, is this what I get:
A bunch of stories to interpret?

I'm ready to rocket like rock and roll
You are the flower in glittering gold
Sleeping in the palm, the palm of my hand
They show you who to follow, it looks like a man.
