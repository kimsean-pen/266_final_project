Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help, falling in love with you
Shall I stay
Would it be a sin
If I can't help, falling in love with you

Like a river flows, surely to the sea
Darling so it goes, some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help, falling in love with you

Like a river flows, surely to the sea
Darling so it goes, some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help, falling in love with you
For I can't help, falling in love with, you
