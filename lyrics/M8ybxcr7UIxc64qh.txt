Love Without Sound

Beyond the outside was one left to right
Within ourselves the suns or the night
Just bound by blue ethereality
Drifting onto my dream free

My mind explored our labyrinth eyes
Her sundrenched body lay hypnotised
Perfumed electric garden roused female
But now the laughter turns pale

Dreams gone just melting fever in my soul
Within my head the bell seems to toll
Fast breathing wreathing heaving hippies down
Now making love without sound

It never had been made like that before
Our maiden knighthood longing bright for more
Her leg stood firm the dead wind sighed come on
Mistral away now she's gone
