Hey, the chances I must waste
Hey, ever dirge even their moth got a jar
Is what it takes
Is what it takes
Is what it takes
Is what it takes

Paper chase is on
These are on my speed
For you are but
But around the fold
On the charnel, by your gin trap
Paper chase is on
These are on my space

Paper chase is on
Hey, the chances I must waste
These are on my speed
For you are but
But around the fold
On the charnel, by your gin trap
Oh, you are but ever by the jar
Paper chase is on
These are on my space

I watch him trail
I watch him trail
I watch him trail
I watch him trail
