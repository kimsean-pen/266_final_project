Happiness is an allusion
Hold me close to see me a little more
Until my body feels your magic touch and steals my skin before it rots
My castle is a great illusion

Now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone
Now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone, its less than I've ever been

Hairy eyes are an obstruction
Help me die don't wanna rush ya

And all I need is a philosophy of noise to help me laugh and breath
My castle is a great illusion

Now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone
Now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone, its less than I've ever been
Now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone
Now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone, its less than I've ever been

This is the one [x38]
