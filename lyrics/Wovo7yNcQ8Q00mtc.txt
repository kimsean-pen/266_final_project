Give me somewhere to be
Take me to somewhere now
You might as well waste your time with me
If you're gonna be here

Get away
From the woods that make you afraid
Down to the last few strands of thought
Making you a target for a fight

Give me somewhere to be
Take me to somewhere now
You might as well waste your time with me
If you're gonna be here

Wait

Wait

Wait

Wait

I don't think I'll work out
As your best friend
I don't want to hold you down
I know there's someone better for you

I don't want to be around
When you've gotta go

Go away
Go away
