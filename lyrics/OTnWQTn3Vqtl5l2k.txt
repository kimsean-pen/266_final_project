I know when he's been on your mind
That distant look is in your eyes
I thought with time you'd realize it's over, over

It's not the way I choose to live
But something somewhere's got to give
A share in this relationship gets older, older

You know I'd fight for you but how can I fight someone who isn't even there?
Had the rest of you now I want the best of you, I don't care if that's not fair

'Cause I want it all
Or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom it's now or never

Is it all?
Or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends?
With a simple telephone call
You leave me here with nothing at all

There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you with memories
I feel it in my heart but I don't show it, show it
Then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
Those times I don't believe it's right I know it, know it

Don't make me promises, baby, you never did know how to keep them well
I've had the rest of you now I want the best of you, it's time to show and tell

'Cause I want it all
Or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom it's now or never
Is it all?
Or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends?
With a simple telephone call
You leave me here with nothing

'Cause you and I
Lose it all if you've got no more room
No room inside for me in your life

'Cause I want it all
Or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
It's now or never
Is it all?
Or nothing at all?
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom it's now or never
Is it all?
Or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends?
With a simple telephone call
You leave me here with nothing at all
