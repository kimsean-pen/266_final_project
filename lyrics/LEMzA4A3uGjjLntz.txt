Hang out the flags, a new world order? s on the way
Start singing now, a song to greet the joyful day

Just when we thought the time was right for celebrating
With music of the spheres
What? s this another boat of fleeing refugees
On a sea of children? s tears

Once more the sound of crying
Is number one across the earth
Once more the sound of crying
Is number one across the earth

We? re only men and women doing what we can
Sometimes I think that God is working to a plan

Then other times I swear that he is improvising
Discordant and remote
Another orphan baby in a failed uprising
Another real bum note

Once more the sound of crying
Is number one across the earth
Once more the sound of crying
Is number one across the earth

Once more the sound of crying
Once more the sound of crying

And if you? re listening up there
You could consider this a prayer

Well, who am I to tell you how to run your business
Man, you could strike me blind
What kind of noise we gotta make down here
Before we destroy your peace of mind

Once more the sound of crying
Is number one across the earth
Once more the sound of crying
Is number one across the earth

Once more the sound of crying
Once more the sound of crying

And if you? re listening up there, yeah, yeah
The sound of crying

Once more the sound of crying
Once more the sound of crying
(The sound of crying)

Once more the sound of crying
Once more the sound of crying
Once more the sound of crying
Once more the sound of crying

Once more the sound of crying
