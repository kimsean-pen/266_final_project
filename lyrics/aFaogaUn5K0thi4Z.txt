Everyone except for you passes me by
Oh, tell me why I am doomed to hold on to this fight
While I stay in all day shutting away these thoughts I have to hide
But I'm kidding myself
I know that nothing will change the way I feel inside

These pages of gold that we have in stored
In all minds, oh
Telling me otherwise, they say
Don't give in to the unheard, cry
Don't give in to the unheard, cry
Oh, oh, oh

A year has passed and I still am Engrossed, how I feel, I forget
If it's such a big ask to be granted a day
When there's no need to fret
Then suddenly you cease to love me
I was so silly to think I was free
I worry too much
It's true I miss your touch
But I can't be a part of this villany

These pages of gold that we have in stored
In all minds, oh
Telling me otherwise, they say
Don't give in to the unheard, cry
Don't give in to the unheard, cry
Oh, oh, oh

Still trying to love another, I'll pretend it doesn't bother me
To try to love another, I'll pretend it doesn't bother me
For now, it's been too long for me to expect any sympathy

And I have now found the key

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
