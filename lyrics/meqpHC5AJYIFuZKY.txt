Heard of your voice, heard the melody of your song
Know of your passion of your roots and culture
For you know who brings forth, all the fruits of nature
Who brings forth your light when the earth turn to dark
Hear I little darling, ease your troubles down
Hold to your faith, watch your troubles drown

Virtuous girl
Jah has your heart
Lust of earth couldn't set you apart
This I know, have no doubt
Cuz true faith never quick to give out
Virtuous girl your eyes remind me of a time before this life
Back to a dream when evil did cease
as the dawn of time yea

Like a chizel to a rock,
you have worked spoken word, carved them into I heart
See truth in you eyes, hits all the time
and heals as the green herb
As smoke is driven away, drive them away
Hold to your faith
Jah see them from far away
and judges their fate
Hear I little darling, just sow to your ground
Reap your love, for the wicked gone down

Virtuous girl
Jah has your heart
Lust of earth couldn't set you apart
This I know, have no doubt
Cuz true faith never quick to give out
Virtuous girl your eyes remind me of a time before this life
Back to a dream when evil did cease
as the dawn of time yea

Ring out your voice, ring out your voice
Virtuous girl

Virtuous girl
Jah has your heart
Lust of earth couldn't set you apart
This I know, have no doubt
Cuz true faith never quick to give out
Virtuous girl your eyes remind me of a time before this life
Back to a dream when evil did cease
as the dawn of time yea

Virtuous girl your eyes remind me of a time before this life
Back to a dream when evil did cease
as the dawn of time yea
