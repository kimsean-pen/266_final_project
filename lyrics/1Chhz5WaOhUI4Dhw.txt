I do declare, there's something in the air
I'm burning the candle at both ends
Bitter betrayals, skeleton keys
Houses to haunt, well it's alright by me

Rags to ruin, some foolhardy choices
Some would say, not a ghost of a chance
The ghosts in my mind, they're one of a kind
They tell me what to do, and it's shut down you

Some things are best just left unsaid
End of the line, end of the line
One door closes, another door closes
And now you're boxed in

End of the line, end of the line
Feel eyes in the trees, the foreboding path
The turn of the head, I hear it laugh
It says "Hang 'em now," it says "Hang 'em high"

When you are done, then hail to the sky
I've been taught to get the fuck up
To dust myself off, and to go it again
The ghosts in my mind, they're one of a kind

They tell me what to do, and it's shut down you
Some things are best just left unsaid
End of the line, end of the line
One door closes, another door closes

And now you're boxed in
End of the line, end of the line
Shit

Bitter betrayals, the foreboding path
I've come to shut you down
Rags to ruin, some foolhardy choices
Some would say, not a ghost of a chance

The ghosts in my mind, they're one of a kind
They tell me what to do, and it's shut down you
Some things are best just left unsaid
End of the line, end of the line

One door closes, another door closes
And now you're boxed in
End of the line, end of the line
