Everything the sun touch, belongs to me
And everywhere the moon creeps, is where I be
It's simply no defeating us
We can't be beat
You see HollowSquad the regimen, pull the strings
I stomp you boys from underneath, stay away from me
We pull up to your venue, and crush the whole thing
I might let her smoke the blunt but not the whole thing
I'm higher than the Gundam wing, eating chicken wings
I know this girl from Asia, all I say is dong ding
She flipped them words around then she descend to her knees
Bitch I don't say please I'm just taking what I please
Boy, stay the fuck up out my way before I swing on ye
He thought that I was playin' till he saw me on his street
All these rap niggas need help, so they listenin' to me
I got ears in the streets, I got eyes in the streets
Bitch talkin' shit 'bout me can get you mangled in your sleep
I ain't ever been a bitch, boy ask anyone with me
You can copy all my style but you can't copy my unique
All I do is roll a blunt and keep watch on the sea
I'm a Bloodshore lord, can't no human tangle me
Put my blade in his mouth, now let this pussy boy speak
I will cut his teeth up out his gums if he lie on me
I won't ever become weak. I can't ever become weak
Cause the truth is in my strength that lets me swing so freely
All I want to do is smoke my weed, and live in peace
But these idiots in the world, make it hard to keep it clean
Tell the children wait inside while I'm on the killing spree
Tell the children close their eyes while the blood cover me
We don't need no damn help, all you labels lookin' silly
Why the fuck would we sell music, when we sellin' out the building
We don't need no gas, we on E, driving fast, smokin' on a new zip
I ain't even finished with my last, bitch
