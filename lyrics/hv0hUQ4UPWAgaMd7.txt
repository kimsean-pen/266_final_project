I stare the skies of abandoned hearts
Dare I break the waves will I be safe?
Our secret Atlantis
We were the only ones who knew what we were hiding
You from me and me from you

Show me where I go when my life's run dry
Hold me until my wounds stop bleeding
And I wanted to let you know

That I'm leaving to let this go
And the sky is painting my sorrow
The sky is painting my sorrow

Recreate the created and a certain fate
Through the waters I got to learn how to swim again
I never thought that I'd embrace new horizons
Once boarded with a purpose

Never thought I'd wake up in defiance
But I knew how I felt when the sky changed
When the treason was too hard to follow
I felt left, tainted and hollow

Show me where I go when my life's run dry
Hold me until my wounds stop bleeding
And I wanted to let you know

That I'm leaving to let this go
And the sky is painting my sorrow
The sky is painting my sorrow

And I wanted to let you know
That I'm leaving to let this go
And the sky is painting my sorrow
The sky is painted in sorrow
The sky is painted in sorrow
