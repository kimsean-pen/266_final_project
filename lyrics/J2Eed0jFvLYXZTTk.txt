It's been almost 20 years on the red planet
A place where there are no tears
It is just water floating, no they're not quite emoting
I dream of the other days of the time I held you
Left in an odd(?) embrace, Now I do in bottles
Just Collecting the Marbles(?)
Well I waited for you out here
But that was just dillusional
And I've painted all these pictures
Of Earth, but that's unusual
Unusual, to you
Met at a seminar, Shared the same table
Brushed by you a the bar
Didn't match your discription
Soon became my prescription
I think of the dream that passed
In the spring going far more than Jupiter
It doesn't draw a reaction, Temporary distraction
And I've waited for you out here
But that may be dillusional
And I've painted all these pictures
Of Earth but that's unusual
Unusual, To you
Unusual, Unusual, Unusual
To you

And for forever, and that was just dillusional
So I've painted all these pictures
Of Earth but that that's unusual
Unusual, Unusual, Unusal
To You
