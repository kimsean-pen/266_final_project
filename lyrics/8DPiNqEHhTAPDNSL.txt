Again x 10

The idea was always there in its infancy
The seed took root over many years
An idea grows before it walks
And as it walks, it learns to run
And as it runs, it feels its form
The waterfall, can it be stopped?

Again x 12

Again I stop the waterfall by simply thinkin'
Again I stop the waterfall before my breathin'
Again I stop the waterfall by finally feelin'
Again I stop the waterfall by just believin'
Again I stop the waterfall by simply thinkin'
Again I stop the waterfall before my breathin'
Again I stop the waterfall by finally feelin'
Again I stop the waterfall by just believin'

Again x 11

The idea was always there in its infancy
The seed took root over many years
