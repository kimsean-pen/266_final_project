La, la, la, la...

When I'm stuck on the ground,
There's no up, only downs,
Every slip sends me falling,
Not sure how to begin,
How to rise, like the wind,
So that soon I'll be soaring,
I just breathe, and I let myself believe,

Coz' hope has wings,
To carry you,
Anything is possible,
Just might be,
A miracle,
Waiting to come true,

So I lift my eyes,
And see the sky,
Feel my heart begin to fly,
I will be carried by my dreams,
Coz' hope has wings.

(Coz hope has wings, hope has wings)

I can climb through the clouds,
Far away from the down,
That would be so amazing,
Feel the sun on my face,
Such a beautiful place,
Yeah, I know that it's fading,
Skating the same,
With courage and with faith,

Coz' hope has wings,
To carry you,
Anything is possible,
Just might be,
A miracle,
Waiting to come true,

So I lift my eyes,
And see the sky,
Feel my heart begin to fly,
I will be carried by my dreams,
Coz' hope has wings.

Like a flame, like a spark,
I'm make the change,
There's a star in the dark,
Calling out my name
Finally, I can see,
Now I'm on my way (now I'm on my way)

Coz' hope has wings, (Hope has wings)
To carry you,
Anything is possible, (Anything)
Just might be, (yeah)
A miracle,
Waiting to come true, (come true)

So I lift my eyes, (lift my eyes)
And see the sky,
Feel my heart begin to fly, (yeah)
I will be carried by my dreams, (by my dreams)
(lalalalala)

I have a new hope that lives in me,
Anywhere I go it sets me free,
It shines a light, its everywhere,
From north to south, it takes me there,

I have a new hope that lives in me,
Anywhere i go it sets me free,

La la la la...
La la la la...
Hope has wings, Hope has wings,
La la la la.
La la la la...
