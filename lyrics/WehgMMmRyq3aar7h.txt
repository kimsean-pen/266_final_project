If you love it like I love it
And you feel what I feel inside
If you want it like I want it
Then baby let's get it tonight
If you feel it, say hell yeah (hell yeah)
Say hell yeah (hell yeah)
Say hell yeah (hell yeah)
This is love, this is love, this is love

Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
This is love, this is love, this is love

This is love for the beats
Steal it in the streets
Love for the melody, no song is cheap
The dope crusader, funky terminator
I created me a rocker just so we could rock it later
And the wait up beat is knocking
Got me feeling, alright, cause the dj got me walking on a steeler
I got a rocket full of gold, mami's just gold
I fill it up and love it, and then I watch it explode

If you love it like I love it
And you feel what I feel inside
If you want it like I want it
Then baby let's get it tonight
If you feel it, say hell yeah (hell yeah)
Say hell yeah (hell yeah)
Say hell yeah (hell yeah)
This is love, this is love, this is love

Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
This is love, this is love, this is love

This is love for the bass, and love for the treble
Love for the orchestra, violin chelo
Love for computer beats, harder than metal
House beats housing, bouncing in the ghetto
We sip till we smash up, feeling alright
And we rock the ghetto blaster, rocking all night
I sent a rocket to the globe, armor just stole
I fill it up and love it, and then I watch it explode

Eh, baby, yeah, alright
Can you feel it?
Good god, yeah, alright

Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
This is love, this is love, this is love

This is love, this is love, this is love
This is love, this is love, this is love
This is love, this is love, this is love
This is love, this is love, this is love
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
