We're indifferent to this deadly conversation
I know you know we both know that it's...

I wonder if you still think I'm right there,
You would make up your mind
Slower than the changing of the seasons.
Wouldn't you know that I have come to terms?
That you wouldn't even care if I choked up and stopped my breathing

This isn't something more than life
Why only calling the breaks tonight
before the morning comes?
I hope you know that
We're indifferent to this deadly conversation
I know you know we both know that it's wrong,
to stay outside
like ships in the night.
I know you know we both know that it's wrong,
so carry on.

I wonder if you think I'm wasting time
I bet you got it all figured out,
but must we try to break the ice
beneath this heart of mine.

I was perfectly lonely,
I want you to show me.
How you'd ever change my mind
When I was the same kid?

This isn't something more than life,
Why only calling the breaks tonight
before the morning comes?
I hope you know that
We're indifferent to this deadly conversation
I know you know we both know that it's wrong,
to stay outside
like ships in the night.
I know you know we both know that it's wrong,
so carry on.

So don't you ever say my name.
When it comes to keep you sane,
I know that you're already gone.

Cause when reality sets, embrace.
You'll be showing the world your second face,
and we can carry on
I hope you know.

We're indifferent to this deadly conversation,
I know you know we both know that it's wrong,
to stay outside
like ships in the night.
I know you know we both know that it's wrong.

This isn't something more than life,
Why only calling the breaks tonight
Before the morning comes?
Before the morning comes?
