There goes the neighborhood
And somehow you knew it would

'Cause you understand
Armageddon's right around the bend

You got your fortune
Right in your hands

You do what you gotta do
'Cause you got a climb an attitude

And you say goodbye
As easy as most people tell a lie

You choose no options
You do or die

Goddamn
The torpedoes
It's time to run away with the sideshow
Full speed
Right ahead
Don't stop
You can sleep when you're dead

Goddamn
The torpedoes
It's time to run away with the sideshow
Full speed
Right ahead
Don't stop
You can sleep when you're dead

That's just the way it goes
That's how the river flows

If you stay stone cold
Chance are your option will unfold

All that glitters
Turns into gold

Goddamn
The torpedoes
It's time to run away with the sideshow
Full speed
Right ahead
Don't stop
You can sleep when you're dead

Goddamn
The torpedoes
It's time to run away with the sideshow
Full speed
Right ahead
Don't stop
You can sleep when you're dead

Be proud to deviate
This time to instigate
Dictate your own fate
Your about to detonate
See the world obliterate

Goddamn
The torpedoes
It's time to run away with the sideshow
Full speed
Right ahead
Don't stop
You can sleep when you're dead

Goddamn
The torpedoes
Dictate your own fate
You're about to detonate
See the world obliterate

Goddamn
The torpedoes
It's time to run away with the sideshow
Full speed
Right ahead
Don't stop
You can sleep when you're dead

Goddamn
The torpedoes
It's time to run away with the sideshow
Full speed
Right ahead
Don't stop
You can sleep when you're dead

Goddamn
The torpedoes
It's time to run away with the sideshow
Full speed
Right ahead
Don't stop
You can sleep when you're dead

Goddamn
The torpedoes
Dictate your own fate
You're about to goddamn detonate
