The time is now, now is the time
Is not the only time, eye on the prize
My eye on the prize
Now is the time, the time is now
Now is the time to
The time is now, now is the time
To say, say, say, say what I mean
Eye on the prize, I got my eye on the prize
The time is now, now is the time
The time is now to say, say, say, say
Your eyes wide-eyed on the prize
I've got my eyes on the prize
The time is now, now is the time
The time is now to say, say, say, say
Say, say, say, say, say what I like
Eye, eye, eye, eye on the prize
I got my eye on the prize
The time is now, now is the time
The time is now to say, say, say, say
What I like, like, like
Eye on the prize, I've got my eyes on the prize
The time is now, now is the time
The time is now to set, set, set, set
Set your arms apart-art-art-art-art-art
Eye on the prize
The time is now, now is the time
The time is now to set, set, set, set
Say what I like to be
Eye on the prize
The time is now, now is the time
The time is now to set, set, set, set
Set your arms apart-art
Eye on the prize, I got my eyes on the prize
The time is now, now is the time
The time is now to set your eyes apart
Eye on the prize, eye on the prize
The time is now, now is the time
To set your eyes apart
Eye on the prize, eye on the prize
