Ahh
Ahh
Ahh, ah
See I've been working on a jailbreak
Got no time for a mistake
Any moment 'til the day breaks
No more time to get to know you

I've been working on a jailbreak
Keep it calm with the fast pace
Any moment 'til the day breaks
No more time to get to know you

Now I'm living in a dream
Ahh
Now I'm living in a dream
And I don't think I'm ever gonna wake up
Now I'm living in a dream
(Now I'm living in a dream)
Ahh
Now I'm living in a dream
And I don't think I'm ever gonna wake up

See, I've been working on a jailbreak
Got no time for a new fate
Any moment they'll replace me
Should've tried to get to know you

I've been working on my timing
Insecurity beside me
But, your taste is so inviting
Should've tried to get to know you

Now I'm living in a dream
Ahh
Now I'm living in a dream
And I don't think I'm ever gonna wake up
Now I'm living in a dream
(Now I'm living in a dream)
Ahh
Now I'm living in a dream
And I don't think I'm ever gonna wake up

Oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo
Mama, it's a jailbreak, It's a-it's a jailbreak
Oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo
Mama, it's a jailbreak, It's a-it's a jailbreak

Now I'm living in a dream
Ahh
Now I'm living in a dream
And I don't think ever gonna wake up
Now I'm living in a dream
(Now I'm living in a dream)
Ahh
Now I'm living in a dream
And I don't think I'm ever gonna wake up

Ahh
Ahh
Ahh
Mama, it's a jailbreak, It's a-it's a jailbreak
Ahh
Ahh
Ahh
Mama, it's a jailbreak, It's a-it's a jailbreak
