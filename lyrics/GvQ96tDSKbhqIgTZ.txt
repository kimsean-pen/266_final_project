Lying here with you
Listening to the rain
Smiling just to see
The smile upon your face
These are the moments
I thank God that I'm alive
These are the moments
I'll remember all my life
I found all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more
Looking in your eyes
Seeing all I need
Everything you are
Is everything to me
These are the moments
I know heaven must exist
These are the moments
I know all I need is this
I have all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more

I could not ask for more
Than this time together
I could not ask for more
Than this time with you
Every prayer has been answered
Every dream I have's come true
And right here in this moment
Is right where I'm meant to be

Here with you, here with me

These are the moments
I thank God that I'm alive
These are the moments
I'll remember all my life

I've got all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more

I could not ask for more
Than this time together
I could not ask for more
Than this time with you
Every prayer has been answered
Every dream I have's come true

And right here in this moment
Is right where I'm meant to be
Here with you, here with me
I could not ask for more
Than the love you give me
'Cause it's all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more
And I could not ask for more
