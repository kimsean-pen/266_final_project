It's all here, now it's all here
Now it's all here
Now it's always been here
It's alright, now it's alright
Now it's alright
Now it's always been right

You do nothing, to leave girl looking, do
You do not have to reach out to somebody new
You do not have to hold her in your fingertips

It's always there with you
You are what I need

And it's alright, now it's alright
Now it's alright
Now it's always been right
All right, all right, all right

I hear you in my thoughts
I see you in my dreams
I know you are my mind
And you are everything
Stay and stay a while
I still remind all be here
And stood here
All night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night
