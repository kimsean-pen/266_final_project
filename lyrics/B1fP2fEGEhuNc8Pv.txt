Ground below, just save me from it all
Ground below, embrace me
Dark the soul that saves me, you save me from
With all your faith, the more we take away

In a daydream all along such fragile words
A daydream all along fragile worth
It escapes me, all alone my tainted soul
It escapes me, all control, Tragic Idol

Dark the soul, such frailty and self control
The more we take, the more you fade away

In a daydream all along such fragile words
In a daydream all along, fragile worth
It escapes me all alone my tainted soul
It escapes me, all control,

Ground below, just save me
Ground below, embrace me
Long ago you saved me, saved me from it all
Your darkened soul embraced me
Gave me such resolve
Long ago you saved me, saved me from it all
Your darkened soul embraced me
It escapes me all alone my tainted soul
It escapes me, all control, Tragic Idol, Tragic Idol, Tragic Idol
