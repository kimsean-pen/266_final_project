Running out of time
Spending all my money at the garage and grime nights
My face looks weird when its too bright
Please turn off the lights
Lets make this one to forget
Is that alright
When i wake up ill regret tonight
Drink some shots
Take off our clothes
Gonna get a piercing on my nose
Mum asks why
I dont know who knows
Its not like me who chose
I feel so sad and i feel so happy
Please someone come change the size of my nappy
Cups and speakers
...bleachers
London crew
We're just like you
Wanna lose weight
But i wanna get take out
You're gay im straight do you wanna make out
Run a zoo
Have a hoot
Forgot i told you
I liked you
Im on pill number two
Fayes got a fag
So do you wanna...
Drunk calls and drunk texts
Twitter updates i regret
I know i get that we are young
But i feel like we are having too much fun
In my dreams you take me to the side
In my dream you say you got feelings you cant hide
I wish one day my dream could be in real life
Cos in my dream i never wanna close my eyes
In my dream you proberly come and chill at mine
In my dream its me and you all of the time
I wish one day my dream could be in real life
Cos in my dream i never wanna close my eyes
We call ourselfs squad
Its an act we want you to appauld
It makes me feel so alive
To in chill... and take a dive
The odd ones out of the bee hive
We do the stank
You do the jive
We're the girls
And their the guys
My big sister still makes me cry
Do you ever get that feeling
That we are taking too much time
To realise
We're living in lies
In disguise
But it feels so nice
Its not about what your grades are
What job you end up to do
As long as you like me
And i like you
We'll be too
Be too cute
Run a zoo
Have a hoot
Forgot i told you
I liked you
Im on pill number two
Fayes got a fag
So do you wanna...
Drunk calls and drunk texts
Twitter updates i regret
I know i get that we are young
But i feel like we are having too much fun
In my dreams you take me to the side
In my dream you say you got feelings you cant hide
I wish one day my dream could be in real life
Cos in my dream i never wanna close my eyes
In my dream you proberly come and chill at mine
In my dream its me and you all of the time
I wish one day my dream could be in real life
Cos in my dream i never wanna close my eyes
In my dreams you take me to the side
In my dream you say you got feelings you cant hide
I wish one day my dream could be in real life
Cos in my dream i never wanna close my eyes
In my dream you proberly come and chill at mine
In my dream its me and you all of the time
I wish one day my dream could be in real life
Cos in my dream i never wanna close my eyes
In my dreams you take me to the side
In my dream you say you got feelings you cant hide
I wish one day my dream could be in real life
Cos in my dream i never wanna close my eyes
In my dream you proberly come and chill at mine
In my dream its me and you all of the time
I wish one day my dream could be in real life
Cos in my dream i never wanna close my eyes
