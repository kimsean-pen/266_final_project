Outside, there's a boxcar waiting
Outside, the family stew
Out by the fire breathing
Outside, we wait 'til face turns blue

I know the nervous walking
I know the dirty beard hang, hang, hangs
Out by the boxcar, waiting
Take me away to Nowhere Plains

There is a wait so long
(So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man

Big shake on the boxcar moving
Big shake to the land that's falling down
Is a wind, makes a palm stop blowing

A big, big stone fall and break my crown

There is a wait so long

(So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Hey, here's your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here he comes
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here he comes, your man
Here comes your man
Hey, here's your man
Here he comes
