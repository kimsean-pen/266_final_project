(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Come into the union district
Drive down on Sharmon Palms
White ghettos paint a picture
Broken homes and broken bones
I was so full of scotch I could not stand up
I was hittin the shots and I moved to a cup
Release me from moral assumption
Total rejection total destruction
Nihilistic feelings are movin
If you try really hard
You'll see right through them
(Nihilism, nihilism, nihilism, nihilism)
Come into the union district
Drive down in Sharmon Palms
White ghettos paint a picture
Broken homes and broken bones
Raking a path of self destruction
Not affected by the repercusions
Lady in the billboard offer me a drink
Said not right now i need time to think
Nihilistic feelings are movin
If I try real hard
I'll see right through them
(Nihilism, nihilism, nihilism, nihilism)
Nihilism
Nihilism
Nihilism I was so full of scotch I could not stand up
Nihilism I was hittin the shots and I moved to a cup
Nihilism Come into the Union District drive down on Sharmon Palms
Nihilism White ghetto paints a picture broken homes and broken bones
