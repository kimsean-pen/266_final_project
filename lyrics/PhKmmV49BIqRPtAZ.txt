Stand here for me angel
Oh little child so broken and wild
Bear not for life on your shoulder
Just kiss it one last time

Was the music too loud for you, too raw to be true
Were the abstracts too dark for you, I beg you now too...

...watch the sky so bright, see all its light - fade!

Here I am, was it everything you spoke of
Oh little angel
Yeah! Here I am, was it verything you've dreamt of
Oh little angel

Bow down for me heavenly one, shed not those tears my little friend
Fear not God anymore because you'll find him in my arms

Was the volume too high for you, too tough for the blue
Were desires too dark for you, too good to be true

...watch the sky so bright, see all its light - fade!

Here I am, was it everything you spoke of
Oh little angel
Yeah! Here I am, was it verything you've dreamt of
Oh little angel

Tell me now how your wings got broken
Tell me now how your spine got whipped by leather
Tell me now how your tounge got split
Tell me all the things you need to fell to drift away

Watch the sky so bright see all its light

Watch the sky so full of light
For the last time so bright
