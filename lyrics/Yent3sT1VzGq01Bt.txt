I thought I have you - but, I feel alone
You are my gravity - but, now I fall

Fall!
Now I fall!
Fall!
Now I fall!

I've been following your footprints
Following your leads
I've been following your footprints
Following your leads

I want to go out and get lost
In the forest in the dust
I want to forget my way back home
And get more drunk the further I go

I thought I have you - but, I feel alone
You are my gravity - but, now I fall
Your words fooled me - I've been clouded by your beauty
Trusted all your promises - now I'm lost in eternity

Somebody blow the air into my lungs
Cause I forgot how to breathe
Somebody please help me rise
Cause I have swollen, tired knees
My weakness is the reason of my pain
Being selfish and possessive is my shame
I'm far and all alone, I miss you!
I miss you and I know you are my home

I thought I have you - but, I feel alone
You are my gravity - but, now I fall
Your words fooled me - I've been clouded by your beauty
Trusted all your promises - now I'm lost in eternity

Fall!
Now I fall!
Fall!
Now I fall!

I've been following your footprints
Following your leads
Now I fall!
I've been following your footprints
Following your leads
Now I fall!

There's no way out of this misery
It's gonna be hard every time

There's no way out
It's gonna be hard every time

There's no way out
It's gonna be hard every time

There's no way out of this misery
It's gonna be hard every time
Endlessly fighting with the insecurity
It puts us on the edge of committing a crime

There's no way out of this misery
It's gonna to be hard every time
Endlessly fighting with the insecurity
It puts us on the edge of committing a crime

There's no way out
