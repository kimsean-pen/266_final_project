Desolate, i just watch... the trail
in which i walked to get here...
...all in vain,
no reward to make me lift up my head.

Bitter was my defeat,

I see the sky covered

with the grey smoke that my eyes were never able to stand.

...in
the...
decaying reality...

I am just a crawling worm in a world of lies.
