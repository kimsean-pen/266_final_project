Drive!

Drive!
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
Yes she did
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac

She said, "Hey, come here, Daddy
I ain't never comin' back!"
Baby, baby, won't you hear my plea?

Yea, c'mon, sugar
Just c'mon back to me
She said, "Balls to you, Big Daddy"
Yea

Baby, baby, won't you hear my plea?
Oh, oh c'mon, just hear my plea
She said, "Balls to you, Daddy"
She ain't comin' back to me

Oh God
Baby, baby, drove up in a Cadillac
I said, "Jesus Christ, where'd you get that Cadillac?"
She said, "Balls to you, Daddy"
She ain't never comin' back
She ain't, she ain't comin' back
She ain't never comin' back
She ain't never comin' back
She ain't never comin' back!
