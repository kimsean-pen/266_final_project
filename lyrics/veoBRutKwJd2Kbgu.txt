The end on the road
And i won't be there tomorrow,
The end on the road
And i won't be there
I won't be there

Story of the night
Shows Itself
When you go? to sleep
There another ceiling
God release me, please release me!.

The end on the road
And i won't be there tomorrow,
The end on the road
And i won'tbe there
I won't be there

Seeing grey and white
choose there
all my spine.
greatments on the inside
God release me, please release me!.

The end on the road
And i won't be there tomorrow,
The end on the road
And i won'tbe there
I won't be there

The end on the road
And i won't be there tomorrow,
The end on the road
And i won'tbe there
I won't be there

Shivers all around me
Circles on the floor
it is till breathing
Around the soul

The end on the road
And i won't be there tomorrow,
The end on the road
And i won'tbe there
I won't be there

The end on the road
And i won't be there tomorrow,
The end on the road
And i won'tbe there
I won't be there

I won't be there
I won't be there
