Cradle more
The hours reel
Cradle more
How you feel
Baby, you're still too proud to come down
Maybe I'm still too loud to hear
All the waves ascend and disappear
Like a storm
The air you steal
Glacial form
The icy heel
Baby, you're still too proud to come down
Maybe I'm still too loud to hear
All the waves ascend and disappear
Earth is born
To wound and heal
Cradle more
The hours reel
Baby, you're still too proud to come down
Maybe I'm still too loud to hear
All the waves ascend and disappear
