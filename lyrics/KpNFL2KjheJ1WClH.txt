I sing roll away the stone
Set up a trembling in my bone
I sat there all alone
I cried and cried
I saw the moonlight's mirrored glow
On that old dirty city snow
I sat there feeling low
My, oh my

I found some fortune, found some fame
I found them cauterize my veins
Yea, I've been fucked up and I've been a fool

()
Like the shepherd to the lamb
Like the wave onto the sand
I fixed myself up to come and be with you

See I was slow to understand
This river's bigger than I me
It's running faster than I can
Lord, I tried

Between the shadow and the stone
A little pup was being born
A little whelp without his home
Oh my, oh my

Hey mama meet me 'neath the moon
I will be humming out that tune
I've been fucked up and I've been a fool

But like the shepherd to the lamb
Like the wave onto the sand
I fixed myself up to come and be with you

Oh now, mama, here I stand
And mama, I'm reaching for your hand
I fixed myself up to come and be with you

I fixed myself up to come and be with you
I fixed myself up to come and be with you
