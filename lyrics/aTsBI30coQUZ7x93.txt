Your voice is way too loud
there's a crowd
coming down
you say you're leaving town
are you the same
am I to blame?

those words...(?)...
don't quit: and I won't

listening to the tone
of your voice
she...(?)... choice

whatever brings you joy
you gotta go
...(?)...

those words...(?)... how long
don't quit: and I won't
those words...(?). how long
don't quit: and I won't

I guess it could be worse
I guess it won't be worse

those words.(?).
don't quit: and I won't
those words ...(?)
don't quit: and I won't"
