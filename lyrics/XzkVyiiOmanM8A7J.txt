You say it's the words, the words
that we didn't speak
But it's mostly the words that you didn't keep
The mistake's being me, I didn't see
All of the smoke and the mirrors being reflected of of me

Somebody should have told me
Darkness is key
Somebody should have showed me
How was I supposed to see
That even as you think you're breaking
and even as your voice is shaking
I am not the only
That is what somebody should have told me

Dancing in a haze we pretend
to be just fine
While inside in disbelief
I'm lost with no cause
just like my, my mommy before me
I needed some peace, someone to believe
See the same as me

Somebody should have told me
Darkness is key
Somebody should have showed me
How was I supposed to see
That even as you think you're breaking
and even as your voice is shaking
I am not the only
That is what somebody should have told me

My will is pure, I adore
grief and give all of me
All I have, all I am and all I wish to be
To be part, to be part of your harmony
Still in my mind, I'm in the corner singing of key

Hey
Somebody should have told me
Darkness is key
Somebody should have showed me
How was I supposed to see
That even as you think you're breaking
and even as your voice is shaking
I am not the only
That is what somebody should have told me
