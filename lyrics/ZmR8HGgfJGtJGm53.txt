Who wants to know?
All that is gold, is rusted
No one will know
Seasons cease, to change, and...
How far we've gone
How far we're going to go
So here and the now
And the love for the sound
Are the moments that keep us moving

Waves crash along
Battered lonely lighthouse
Tomorrow she's gone
And if not, someday, somehow
Are these hands a waste?
Well this side of mortality is
Scaring me to death
To death

Don't think about it at all
Just keep your head low
Don't think about it at all
Soldier on
Soldier on
Keep your heart close to the ground
Soldier on
Soldier on
Keep your heart close to the ground
Don't think about it at all

Just keep your head low
Don't think about it at all
Yeah...

Will you take me tonight
Yeah...
Will you take me tonight
Yeah...
Will you take me tonight

Yeah...
Will you take me tonight
Tonight
Soldier on
Soldier on
Keep your heart close to the ground
