Are you still waiting?
I guess I'll just set the tone
Well maybe I'm jaded
Or maybe I just feel numb
Or maybe it's all her fault
She left my heart alone
Or maybe it's personal and no one needs to know
But what was I saying?
I guess I'll just take it slow
You said that I gave in
Or maybe I just let go
But you wrapped your hands around my neck and said I choked
Well maybe it's all your fault
You left my heart alone
(Maybe I just feel numb)

Let this fill your soul
Do what you have to do to make yourself feel whole
(Maybe I just feel numb)
Let me feel your heart
I only ever tried to love you from the start
(Maybe I just feel numb)

I'm full of regret and I can't forget the way you could
If I only meant as much as you said I always would
After the hell that you've put me through
I guess I'm a fool for not knowing it's true
But now that I see the proof
Your love only shows when it benefits you

Let this fill your soul
Do what you have to do to make yourself feel whole
(Maybe I just feel numb)
Let me feel your heart
I only ever tried to love you from the start
(Maybe I just feel numb)

I can't say that I feel nothing for you
Because the truth is I still try
But I can't feel any sympathy for you
When you keep pushing me aside

Let this fill your soul
Do what you have to do to make yourself feel whole
(Maybe I just feel numb)
Let me feel your heart
I only ever tried to love you from the start
(Maybe I just feel numb)
(Maybe I just feel numb)
(Maybe I just feel numb)
(Maybe I just feel numb)
