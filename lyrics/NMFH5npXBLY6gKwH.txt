Here's my confession
My true belief
Look at me I am the living proof that end can mean relief
I'm gracious but there's something you should know
You have large shoes to fill
So welcome to my freakshow
Here in my netherworld I rule
Let all your manners disappear
Finally your duty's come clear

Sing to me
All you voices of doom
Come on sing to me
Let me hear the sound I like
Cry for me
All you voices of doom
Come on sing to me

You're sweet perdition
I'm lunacy
Look round 'cause this is so different from what you thought you need
I'm driven by 666 my dear
No way back no way out
Been lost before you came here
Here in my netherworld I rule
Let all your manners disappear
Finally your future's come clear

Sing to me
All you voices of doom
Come on sing to me
Let me hear the sound I like
Cry for me
All you voices of doom
Come on sing to me
Sing for me
