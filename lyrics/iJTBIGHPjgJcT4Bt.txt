Talk to me girl, tell me your lies
Let your secrets have no ties
'Cause the light will never shine on this heart of mine
And all the love we sacrificed
Look at all of the damage you have done in time
You can see what a savage I've become, in my eyes
If you look in my heart you will find

No love, no light, no end inside
And I'm looking for a miracle
And I'm looking for a miracle
But I hope, I pray, and I will fight
Cause I'm looking for a miracle
Cause I'm looking for a miracle

There's a place I wanna go
And a life I wanna know
But you crucified my heart of gold
But oh, look at all of the damage you have done in turn
If you offer salvation, I will run into your arms
And deep in my heart you will find

No love, no light, no end inside
And I'm looking for a miracle
And I'm looking for a miracle
But I hope, I pray, and I will fight
Cause I'm looking for a miracle
Cause I'm looking for a miracle

Miracle
And I'm looking for a miracle

There's no love, no light, no end inside
And I'm looking for a miracle
And I'm looking for a miracle
But I hope, I pray, and I will fight
Cause I'm looking for a miracle
Cause I'm looking for a miracle
