I was young and I was reckless, man
Moved out at seventeen and made my momma mad
I thought I had it all figured out
A pocket full of pills and a forty in my mouth
Peeled out in my big black Chevy
Tipped it six times and I knew that I was ready
To straighten up because my best friend died
I didn't wanna carry on living that life

And now I'm running from the scene
'Cause I was caught up in the crime
It's a loaded memory
Yeah, it kills me every time
And I'm trying not to scream
But It's eating me alive
I'm still haunted by
The best years of, the best years of my life

Yeah!
Let me take y'all back
I was young and I was helpless, man
Self-medicating my own depression, man
I drank a bottle after breakfast
Took a look in the mirror, ripped the rosary of my necklace, damn
I lost my job, so I lost faith
I just saw a baby bump in my girl's waist
I need a drink to feel right
Party with my homies to escape from real life

Yeah, we had it all figured out
Pocket full of pills and a forty in my mouth
But, I never should have let my best friend drive

'Cause he's the reason my child would never see me alive
Damn

Now I'm running from the scene
'Cause I was caught up in the crime
It's a loaded memory
Yeah, it kills me every time
And I'm trying not to scream
But It's eating me alive
I'm still haunted by
The best years of, the best years of my life

All the sudden nothing matters anymore
He lost it all, his life was scattered on the floor
And now his family's tryna pick up all the pieces
I am locked up in a box
I am a monster
I'm the reason that's he's gone
Wish I could take it all back
Press rewind and take a picture of the past
Pause it, feel my heart turn black
My lungs are smoldering, I'm breathing in the ash

Now I'm running from the scene
'Cause I was caught up in the crime
It's a loaded memory
Yeah, it kills me every time
And I'm trying not to scream
But It's eating me alive
I'm still haunted by
The best years of, the best years of my life

I'm still haunted by
The best years of, the best years of my life
I'm still haunted by
The best years of
