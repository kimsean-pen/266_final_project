Everything inside of me is what it is, it's not changing
For you, for you; to myself, I stay true
So try to understand it when I tell you that I want you out
'Cause I've been reprimanded for the last time, so just shut your mouth
Bite your tongue 'cause I've had enough
You're speaking under your breath too much, shut up

It's my life, it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same, and I'mma stay this way
It's my life, it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same, and I'mma stay this way

I live my life the way I choose, so walk away before I lose
My mind, it's time for you to say goodbye
Over and over you try to force my hand and make me change
As I get older, I understand it more and hate these games
You put me through, and now I'll never lose
And now the strides I take will guide me straight away from fake-ass punks like you

It's my life, it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same, and I'mma stay this way
It's my life, it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same, and I'mma stay this way

It's never gonna change, it is the same, and I'mma stay this way
It's never gonna change, it is the same, and I'mma stay this way

Let me be, just let me breathe; guaranteed, you can't fix me
Everything that's underneath and inside me is not changing
Let me be, just let me breathe 'cause everything that's underneath
Everything that's underneath is never changing
Everything that's underneath is never changing

Everything inside of me is what it is, it's not changing
For you, for you
It's never gonna change, it is the same, and I'mma stay this way

It's my life, it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same, and I'mma stay this way
It's my life, it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same, and I'mma stay this way

It's my life, it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same, and I'mma stay this way
It's my life, it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same, and I'mma stay this way
