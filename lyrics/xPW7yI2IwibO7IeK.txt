Find a wheel, and it goes round, round, round
As it spins along with a happy sound
As it goes, along the ground, ground, ground
'Til it leads you to the one you love

And your love will hold you round, round, round
And your heart's a song with a brand new sound
And your head, goes spinning round, round, round
'Cause you found what you've been dreaming of

Oh, in the night, see the lights and moon
Going round and round in tune
And the ball of snow in the day
Makes them all wanna say

Find a song (find a song)
And sing it round, round, round
And with ties so strong, your hearts are bound
Hold them near (hold them near)
The ones you found, found, found
For you know that this is really love

Find a wheel (find a wheel)
and it goes round, round, round
As it skims along with a happy sound
As it goes, (as it goes)
Along the ground, ground, ground
'Til it leads you to the ones you love

And your love (and your love)
You'll hold her round, round, round
And your heart's a song with a brand new sound
And your head (and your head) goes spinning round, round, round
'Cause you found right what you've been dreaming of

In the night, you see the lights and moon (the moon)
Going round and round in tune (in tune)
And the ball of snow in the day (day)
Makes them all wanna say

Find a song (find a song) and sing it round, round, round
And with ties so strong, (oh) your hearts are bound
Hold them near (hold them near)
The ones you found, found, found
For you know that this is really love

Find a song, find a song
For you know that this is really love
Yeah, you know that this is really love
