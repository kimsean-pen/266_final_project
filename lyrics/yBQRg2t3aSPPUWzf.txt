Dead in moments and contemplations
Lying on the floor
You've been watching what I've been drinking
Since the night before
Subtle movements are motivations
We hid them in a drawer
Counting birds and carpets
Head straight to the heart with you for sure

So won't you have me over
It's getting dark
Now it makes no difference when we started
I'll take anything to slow this heart down

'Cause its no surprise on most nights
How black skies poured down around us
An entire waving of goodbyes crashed against the surface
It's no surprise on most nights
How black skies poured down around us
And I'm tired of waiting for our lives to crash against the surface
To crash against the surface

I've been counting the marks on ceilings
In all the trips that I did in my feelings
With a single hit of what you've been dealing
I'll stay out of you

So won't you have me [?]
It's getting dark to see this through

'Cause its no surprise on most nights
How black skies poured down all around us
It's an entire waving of goodbyes crashed against the surface
It's no surprise on most nights
How black skies poured down all around us
And I'm tired of waiting for our lives to crash against the surface

To crash against the surface
To crash against the surface
To crash against the surface
To crash against the surface

'Cause its no surprise on most nights
How black skies poured down all around us
An entire waving of goodbyes crashed against the surface
Its no surprise on most nights
How black skies poured down all around us
And I'm tired of waiting for our lives to crash against the surface

To crash against the surface
To crash against the surface
