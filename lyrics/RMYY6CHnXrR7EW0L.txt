I've got something here worth fighting for
Give it all, give it all, give it all
Give me everything that you've got
It's all for one or it's none for all
You're giving me the reason to keep coming back again and again
Give it all, give it all, give it all
Not a single voice unheard or unspoken
I'm not passing time, not along for the ride
You're the fuel to my fire, now watch me burn

Who needs fame and who needs fortune
Cause I've got guts and I've got glory?
We took a shot in the dark and we might have failed
This is our one chance
So ready to see how things turn out

I might have to bite the bullet again
Resentment, no longer my cross to bear
Bitterness and emptiness are a thing of the past
I've found my shelter
I have my home

I've got something here worth fighting for
Give it all, give it all, give it all
Give me everything that you've got
It's all for one or it's none for all
You're giving me the reason to keep coming back again and again
Give it all, give it all, give it all
Not a single voice unheard or unspoken
I'm not passing time, not along for the ride
You're the fuel to my fire, now watch me burn

There's no coming back from this
This could be my destiny, I won't stray from the path
Nothing else can take control of my mind

I've got something here worth fighting for
Give it all, give it all, give it all
Give me everything that you've got
It's all for one or it's none for all
You're giving me the reason to keep coming back again and again
Give it all, give it all, give it all
Not a single voice unheard or unspoken
I'm not passing time, not along for the ride
You're the fuel to my fire, now watch me burn

Burn

With screams over silence taking place of the violence
Standing together we are never alone

With screams over silence taking place of the violence
Standing together we are never alone
With screams over silence taking place of the violence
Standing together we are never alone
