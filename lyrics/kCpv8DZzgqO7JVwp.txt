It.
Started as a joke
Just one of my larks
To see
If somehow I could reach you, so
I swam into your shores
Through an open window
Only to find you all alone
Curled up with machines

Now it seems you're slipping
Out of the land of the li... ving

Just take a closer look
Take a closer look at
What it is that's really haunting you
I have to trust

You'll know
This digital ghost, but
I fear there's only so much time
'Cause the you I knew is fading away

Hands
Lay them on my keys
Let me play you
Again

I am not immune to your net
Find me there in it
I won't go even
If in
Your heart only beats ones and oh's
Switch you on, my friend
Pull you from that rip

Current
But only you can fight against this

Take a closer look!
Just take a closer look at
What it is that's really haunting you
I have to trust
You'll know
This digital ghost, but
I fear there's only so much time
'Cause the you I knew is fading away
Fa... ding
Fading away
