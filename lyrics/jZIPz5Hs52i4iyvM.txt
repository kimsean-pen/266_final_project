Living in your life
All your secrets wishes as an open door for me
But no-one knows them
In a foolish time
When the empty promise're surrounding your heart
I can see you cry
For a million times
I will protect you
For a million times
I will take you home
I'm your guardian angel
You have to remember
I'm your guardian angel
Forever by your side
Living in your life
Everyday is dedicated to your fragile soul
But you can't see me
In a foolish time
Everything is nothing and a golden wave of sand
Can reflect my sight
For a million times
I will protect you
For a million times
I will take you home
I'm your guardian angel
You have to remember
I'm your guardian angel
Forever by your side
I'm your guardian angel
You have to remember
I'm your guardian angel
Forever by your side
I'm your guardian angel
I will take you home
I'm your guardian angel
You have to remember.
