Oh boy for your loveI've searched so thoroughly
But denying all love is where you've left me
We were never believers, yet I'm down on my knees
Praying to escape from these tricks my mind plays
While I'm holding
I'm lying out cold
I'm holding
I'm crying out for more
'Cause you won't leave me alone
Can't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
Even though only your eyes can speak to me
And even though only your lips can sing to me
And although only to your scent I breathe so lasciviously
When I told you you broke me I meant it literally
While I'm holding
I'm lying out cold
I'm holding
I'm dropping on fours
No you won't leave me alone
Can't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
You had me between your thighs
Toes intertwined
Forming roots into a grapevine
From which we'd quench our thirst
Drink, drank, drunk
Drenched in our lust
What happened to us
Crying out for more
Leave me alone
Can't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
I'm holding
