Fall down
Marigold
Fall sounds of rain
Why can't I go
Why can't I go
Those days when spokes wound baseball cards
Tear hear them roar
And faster still those boards which let fly souls
Honeysuckle walk right afternoon time dies
Wish for sometime soon
I'll work it out
Work it out
On my way
So many faces
On my way
So lost
Fall down
Marigold
Fall sounds of rain
Tear hear them roar
Why can't I go
Why can't I go back when this mess was not made
Forever turns out just the same as two months
That rages, that rages on then after
