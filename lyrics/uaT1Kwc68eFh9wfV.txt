he said
come wander with me, love
come wander with me
away from this sad world
come wander with me

he came from the sunset
he came from the sea
he came from my sorrow
and can love only me

oh where is the wanderer
who wandered this way
he's passed on his wandering
and will never go away

he sang of a sweet love
of dreams that would be
but i was sworn to another
and could never be free
