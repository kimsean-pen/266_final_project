Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly
last night
now they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready for a fight gonna see what them racket boys can do

Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state
and the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade
and the gamblin' commissions hangin' on by the skin of its teeth

Everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty
and meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Well I got a job and I put my money away
But I got the kinda debts that no honest man can pay
So I drew out what I had from the Central Trust
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus

Everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Now our luck may have died and our love may be cold
but with you forever I'll stay
We're goin' out where the sands turnin' to gold
so put your stockings on, cause it might get cold
Everything dies, baby that's a fact
but maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
and meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Now I been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find
There's winners and there's losers, and I'm south of the line
Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end
But I talked to a man last night, gonna do a little favor for him
everything dies, baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and meet me tonight in Atlantic City
