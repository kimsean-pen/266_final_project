Whiskey
Give it to me straight
Straight and strong
Drink it til it's gone
Dirty
I got a dirty mouth
Say what I wanna say
Can't wash it away

Well, I'm high, stepping outta the box
Getting out of the cage, I'm busting the lock
Oh, yeah
I'm not scared, I ain't trying to be
I won't give nothing less than all of me
Oh, yeah.

Because I'm unapologetic,
Unapologetic with you tonight
Nothing to hide
Oh, yeah
Unapologetic,
Unapologetic,
Turn on the light, all the lights
And I'll take you as you are
And we'll burn like the stars

Gimme
Gimme something real
Don't play no games
No masquerade
'Cause it's last call, it's closing time
And I think I'm gonna let you read my mind
Oh, yeah, every little piece of me

Because I'm unapologetic,
Unapologetic with you tonight
Nothing to hide
Oh, yeah
Unapologetic,
Unapologetic,
Turn on the light, all the lights
And I'll take you as you are
Burning like the stars

I give you every piece of me
I give you every piece of you
Babe, there's nothing you can say
To make me throw it all away
I won't give nothing less than me
Nothing less than all of me

Unapologetic,
Unapologetic with you tonight
Nothing to hide
Oh, yeah
Unapologetic,
Unapologetic,
Turn on the light, all the lights
And I'll take you as you are
We're burning like the stars
I'll take you as you are
We're burning like the stars
