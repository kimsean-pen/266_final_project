Now I was heading to the bus stop, Matty
You were reading in your room, holed up all day
You picked me up in a brand new Audi
And said "She bought it for herself, on Mother's Day"

Then, we hum along
To some familiar tune
"I like women and songs"
And you said "It's from volume two"

But there you give me one, another you just finished
You're my library, always open for business
But you never show it, you're just sitting with it
But I know the score, and you're killin' it
Line after line, when you're taking it in
To the time after time, when you try to fit in
To some white shoes or a blue collar, alright

So we listened to your choice for the first ten seconds
I turned the dial, I turned your expression
I said "Now haven't you learned your last lesson?"
I try to understand, I just don't get it

Then, we hum along
All from memory
"I like women and songs"
You said "It's from volume three"

But there you give me one, another you just finished
You're my library, always open for business
But you never show it, you're just sitting with it
But I know the score, and you're killin' it
Line after line, when you're taking it in
To the time after time, when you try to fit in
To some white shoes, or a blue collar
To some white shoes, or a blue collar

Take me to the bus stop Matty
Drive me back to Hamilton
You talk about your step dad funny
You sound just like your father's son
In '98 he liberated every latin rhythm
He never used to play it
She could never stand to listen, ho

But there you give me one, another you just finished
You're my library
But you never show it, you're just sitting with it
But I know the score, and you're killin' it
Line after line, when you're taking it in
To the time after time, when you try to fit in
To some white shoes, or a blue collar
Is it your white shoes, or your blue collar

Time after time
Time after time
