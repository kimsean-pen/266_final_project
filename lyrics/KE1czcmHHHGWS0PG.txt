Do you find it can be calming
Do you find it can be soothing
To be lost in your desires
Kill the thoughts for just an hour

Fear pounding hard in my head
This heart clenching up in my chest
It's so hard to ever forget
How you looked the moment I left

I didn't mean to hold back
The warmth I never showed
I didn't mean to tell you
You're better off alone

Pour me another glass
Of your finest bottle of shame
Drown me in all the cheap thrills
This world has to give

Do you find it can be calming
Do you find it can be soothing
To be lost in your desires
Kill the thoughts for just an hour

Emptiness, Emptiness, Emptiness...

Do you find it can be calming
Do you find it can be soothing
To be lost in your desires
Kill the thoughts for just an hour

Emptiness, Emptiness, Emptiness...

Take me
Will you take me away?...
