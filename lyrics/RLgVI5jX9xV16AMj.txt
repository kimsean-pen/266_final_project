I have a hole in my tooth
And my dentists are shut
Maybe this is a sign that I'm all out of luck
Not that I had much of that in my life before
At least my teeth were okay and my gums weren't sore

I have a hole in my tooth
And my dentists are closed
Will I have needles in my mouth I do not know
Looks like I'll be worrying for at least a week
I hope I'm still allowed two sugars in my tea
