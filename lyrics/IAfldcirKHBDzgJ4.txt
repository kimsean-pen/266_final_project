My gut is burning.
Won't you find me some water?
Hey, just forget it can you bring me gasoline?
Collect a couple forks,
Hold them three feet apart
And wait for lightening to strike to burn me up

Cause I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today.

My head is swirling.
Its been carried off in the sky
And where it lands is where it lands.
I guess that I will get another head
Then get on with my life
Leave you somewhere beneath the waves of time.
And I'll wear glass shoes and plastic wrap.
No, I'll just wear my insides.
You want to know who I really am?
Yeah, so do I.
Yeah, so do I.

Cause I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today.

Cause I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today.

Right now, I am turning off the lights

Cause I don't think
I have got the stomach to stomach calling you today.

Cause I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today.

Cause I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today.
