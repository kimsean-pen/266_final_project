I left home to never come back
But I want you, but I want you
Your persuasion brought me back
'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
Expectations got me running away
But I want you, but I want you

You're the one that gave me life
We were bounded by my bondage
Makes me terrified to change
But I just wanted to be honest
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I got my eyes on you,
No turning back
Lock and loaded,
I'm gonna lay you down
I got my eyes on you,
No turning back, no
Lock and loaded,
I'm gonna lay you down

Who do you think you are?
Oh oh hey

Setbacks and failures
Used to put me shame

I always conquer
Exportation wants me to be the same
But I don't want to
I don't want to

Who do you think you are?
Oh yeah
Who do you think you are?
Oh oh yeah

I got my eyes on you,
No turning back
Lock and loaded,
I'm gonna take you down
I got my eyes on you,
No turning back
Lock and loaded,
I'm gonna take you down

Who do you think you are?
Oh oh yeah
Who do you think you are?
Oh oh yeah

I-I got my eyes on you,
No turning back
Lock and loaded,
I'm gonna take you down

I left home to never come back
But I want you, but I want you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I...
