Got some free advice the other day
From an older relative of mine
He said, I dig what you do
But I think you're wasting your time
Yes I do

'Cause driving around
Getting drunk with your friends in a van every night
Sounds like a lotta fun, but you need a plan B
'Cause it ain't gonna last long past twenty one

You'll never make enough money
And no one cares about the things you say
You're gonna wake up someday
And you'll wish you got a job

Spend half your life in that Chevrolet
Driving up and down the freeway
Someday when you're too old to play
Yeah, you'll wish you got a job

I bummed a cigarette from a guy in Manhattan last week
I told him politely, thank you
Then with this hollowed out look, he turned to me and said
You know for twenty five years I've been a banker

In all my many years of life
I suddenly feel obliged to impart to you one free piece of advice
You must invest in your future
I said thanks for the cigarette but I think I know the rest

Or you'll never make enough money
And no one cares about the things you say
You're gonna wake up someday
And you'll wish you got a job

Spend half your life in that Chevrolet
Driving up and down the freeway
Someday when you're too old to play
Yeah, you'll wish you got a job

You'll never make enough money
And no one cares about the things you say
You're gonna wake up someday
And you'll wish you got a job

Spend half your life in that Chevrolet
Driving up and down the freeway
Someday when you're too old to play
Yeah, you'll wish you got a job

You'll never make enough money
And no one cares about the things you say
You're gonna wake up someday
And you'll wish you got a job
