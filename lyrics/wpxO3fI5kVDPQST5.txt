I know a girl who? s obsessed with a guy
She talks for hours and still tomorrow
She? ll call again and when he thinks that this could be the end
She calls again

At six in the morning, she waits to the door
He tells her to leave but still tomorrow
She? ll be there again

She won't let go
Can? t you just go somewhere on vacation?
I could book your flight
And pack your bags

If you want
A one way ticket out of my life
Watching you fly away
I never liked you

She doesn? t care if he tries to ignore
He runs away but still she follows
She'll tries again
She likes to think, she? ll get him in the end, yeah
Can? t you just go somewhere on vacation?

I could book your flight
And pack your bags
If you want
A one way ticket out of my life
Watching you fly away
I never liked you
I never wanted you
I never liked you
I never wanted you, whoa
Can? t you just go somewhere on vacation?
I could book your flight
And pack your bags
If you want
A one way ticket out of my life
Watching you fly away
I never liked you
I never wanted you
I never liked you
I? m not in love with you
