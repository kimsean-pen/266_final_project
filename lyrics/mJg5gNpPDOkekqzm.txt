I stay awake in the middle of a paradise
You're sleeping like a bird and it's fine
My love is good enough
Believe me I'm the truth
When I dream in your arms
Oh come come come on

You go away in the middle of this bloody night
I'm aching like a dog but it's fine
My love was good enough
Believe me I'm the truth
When I cry all the day
Oh come come come back

I stay awake in the middle of a paradise
You're sleeping like a bird and it's fine
My love is good enough
Believe me I'm the truth
When I dream in your arms
Oh come come come on

You go away in the middle of this bloody night
I'm aching like a dog but it's fine
My love was good enough
Believe me I'm the truth
When I cry all the day
