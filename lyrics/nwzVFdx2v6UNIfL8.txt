in this blank night I'll see their blank faces
mutating into something that's even less

they drain the city, dry the pools of consciousness
they drain the city, dry the pools of consciousness
how are you feeling? good
how are you feeling? good

and the conversation rises
and then slowly fades into silence
how are you feeling? good
how are you feeling? good

I want to sleep

and everything seems less like itself
and more like everything else
there was never meant to be clarity
there was never meant to be clarity

how are you feeling? good
I'm not losing it all the time

how are you feeling good?
