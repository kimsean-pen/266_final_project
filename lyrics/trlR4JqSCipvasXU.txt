Uh, big will, uh I'm 'bout to freak this
What you want me to freak this?
Just peep it while I freak this
Aight, aight

I'm 'bout to freak this full out the King of the hill
Big will keepin' it real knees in da grill
The whole set all locked down, makin' you flock down
Where I'm at they here my rap
I be that cat to set trends
Where y'all at on the corner with your friends
Heard you screamin' about cream in your rap kid
Yo my last check for wild wild west came on a flat bed

Once and for all lets get this straight
How you measure a rapper what make an M.C. great
Is it the sales? 20 mill, is it the cars? Bentley's
Is it the women? Jada, is it the money? Please
Mr. Clean yet the fact remain
Got girls that don't speak English screamin' my name
All you rappers yellin' 'bout who you put in a hearse
Do me a favor write one verse without a curse

I'm 'bout to freak this

Can't nobody do this the way I do
You like how I freaky freak this say I do

Haters sick of the hits like the witch
Of the west nobody wicked as this
I read in rap pages they refer to me as soft
Yeah, more like Microsoft

Will gates of the rap game
Quintessential mega maniac what's my rap name
Big will I'm the man
Not conceded I'm as good as I say I am
Dang, diggy, dang, da-dang, da-dang, diggy, diggy

Tone and poke lace tha track
I lace the rap, Jeff do the cut
Yeah what, Rob do the mix, tape to J.L.
Then Tommy Mattola put it on sell
Then come da moment of truth
Hot off the press to the D.J. booth
(Ay yo here it comes y'all that brand new Will Smith cut)
As soon as it drop watch the phones blow up

Boom then ship a mill
Quick to the store, what sold out?
When y'all gettin' more
Finally get it, bump the track
Then come the multi-platinum plaque
Now I'm gonna leave it up to you
I bang the hits out just for you
And then my dream come true
