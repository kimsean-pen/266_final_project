This is manipulation
Yeah

I hesitated, got lost again
You saw me as wounded prey
I was a wreck, I was a bloody mess
And you couldn't look away

You broke me down
So you could take me out

This is isolation
Kept in the dark and waiting
You're wearing the crown of kingdoms I created
Now I can't escape it
All of the light is fading
This isn't trust
This is manipulation

I didn't say what you wanna hear
And your lips began to curl
I'm pushing back and now you start acting
Like you gave me the world

You broke me down
So you could take me out

This is isolation
Kept in the dark and waiting
You're wearing the crown of kingdoms I created
Now I can't escape it
All of the light is fading
This isn't trust
This is manipulation

I don't need, I don't need, I don't need you
This isn't trust
This is manipulation

I don't believe, don't believe, don't believe you
This isn't trust
This is manipulation

You've got hell to pay
You'll get what's coming to you

This is isolation
Kept in the dark and waiting
You're wearing the crown of kingdoms I created
Now I can't escape it
All of the light is fading
This isn't trust
This is manipulation

I don't need, I don't need, I don't need you
This isn't trust
This is manipulation

I don't believe, don't believe, don't believe you
This isn't trust
This is manipulation

This is manipulation
This is manipulation
