You got the whole world in your pocket, but you just don't know
Everybody's smilin' at you everywhere you go
It's like you've got that secret that everybody else wants to know

Anywhere you are is just like home to you
From the beaches in Manila down to Kathmandu
Yeah, you've got that secret that everybody else wants to know
But you won't ever let it go, oh-oh

Everybody wanna hold your hand
Everybody wanna shine that bright
Everybody wanna say they can
Everybody wanna live your life

Everybody wanna talk like you
Only wanna do the things you do
'Cause they always gonna turn out right
Everybody wanna live your life

We take a whole room full of strangers, and we make them friends
We do it all around the world, just so it never ends

It don't matter where we're coming from or going to
You're the only one that ever turns a gray sky blue
And everybody needs a friend like you, oh-oh

Everybody wanna hold your hand
Everybody wanna shine that bright
Everybody wanna say they can
Everybody wanna live your life

Everybody wanna talk like you
Only wanna do the things you do
'Cause they always gonna turn out right
Everybody wanna live your life

Somos ciudadanos del mundo así
Yo siempre a tu lado y tú junto a mí
El mundo está en tus manos, ¿no lo sabes ya?
Como un diamante siempre brillarás, oh-oh

Everybody wanna hold your hand
Everybody wanna shine that bright
Everybody wanna say they can
Everybody wanna live your life

Everybody wanna talk like you
Only wanna do the things you do
'Cause they always gonna turn out right
Everybody wanna live your life

Everybody wanna hold your hand (somos ciudadanos del mundo así)
Everybody wanna shine that bright
Everybody wanna say they can (yo siempre a tu lado y tú junto a mí)
Everybody wanna live your life

Everybody wanna talk like you (somos ciudadanos del mundo así)
Only wanna do the things you do
'Cause they always gonna turn out right (yo siempre a tu lado y tú junto a mí)
Everybody wanna live your life

Everybody wanna hold your hand
Everybody wanna shine that bright
Everybody wanna say they can
Everybody wanna live your life

Everybody wanna talk like you
Only wanna do the things you do
'Cause they always gonna turn out right
Everybody wanna live your life
