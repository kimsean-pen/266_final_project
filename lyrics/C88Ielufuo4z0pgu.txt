You don't know my heart
You don't know my heart
So don't you dare

You don't run my heart
You don't run my heart
Don't pretend to care

I've been working on making it start
Working on making it start again
I'm not in love
I'm not in love

I've been working on making it start
Working on making it start, and I can't
I'm not in love
Can't you see, I'm not in love

You want to meet me out in the dark
You want to meet in misery
How about a room, so low and lovely
With the gloom that's above me

You couldn't know makes me dream
And I couldn't wear the things I've seen
Like the shake, the trembling fiends
Like ache of unused wings

I've been working on making it start
Working on making it start again, but
I'm not in love
I'm not in love

I've been working on making it start
Working on making it start again, but

This isn't love
This isn't love
I'm just a boy
And you're just a girl

You want to be the one to believe it?
You couldn't be the one to believe it
I'm just a boy
And you're just a girl

You don't know my heart
You don't know my heart
So don't you dare

You don't run my heart
You don't run my heart
So don't pretend to care

I've been working on making it start
Working on making it start again
But, I'm not in love
I'm not in love

I've been working on making it start
Working on making it start again, but

This isn't love
This isn't love
I'm just a boy
And you're just a girl

You want to be the one to believe it?
You couldn't be the one to believe it
I'm just a boy
And you're just a girl

This isn't love
This isn't love
I'm just a boy
And you're just a girl

You want to be the one to believe it?
You couldn't be the one to believe it
I'm just a boy
And you're just a girl

You hear what you want to believe.
But you don't owe me
And I don't owe you nothing
