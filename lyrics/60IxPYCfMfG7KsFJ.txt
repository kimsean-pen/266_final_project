My eyes can't believe what they have seen
In the corner of your room
You've stockpiled millions of my memories

Oh doctor, doctor, I must have gotten this sick somehow
I'm going to ask you a series of questions
And I want them answered on the spot, right now

Is it serious? I'm afraid it is, am I gonna die?
Well, son, death is gonna catch up to all one day
But yours is coming quicker than ours, than ours

Some things I may have taken for granted
Again and again, well, here's what was said then
Hold your head high heavy heart

So take a chance and make it big
'Cause it's the last you'll ever get
If we don't take it, when will we make it?

I make plans to break plans
And I've been planning something big
Planning something big, planning

I've never tried to make the best of my time
When I thought that I had plenty of it

Is this serious? I don't know what to think, is it all a lie?
Well, one thing is for sure, I'm taken back to the glory days when
When we were kids without a brash or bitter thing to say

Now my life is one big, make it, or break it
Hold your head high heavy heart
And save your strength for the morning after

So take a chance and make it big
'Cause it's the last you'll ever get
If we don't take it, when will we make it?

I make plans to break plans
And I've been planning something big
Planning something big

So take a chance and make it big
'Cause it's the last you'll ever get
If we don't take it, when will we make it?

I make plans to break plans,
And I've been planning something big
Planning something big, planning

Hold your head high heavy heart
And save your strength for the morning after

So take a chance and make it big
'Cause it's the last you'll ever get
If we don't take it, when will we make it?

I make plans to break plans
And I've been planning something big
Planning something big

So take a chance and make it big
'Cause it's the last you'll ever get
If we don't take it, when will we make it?

I make plans to break plans
And I've been planning something big
Planning something big, planning
