The sea breeze with you
Together with the blues
Smile on all day
Can't get enough of you
As long you feel that too
There is nothing to change
They keep on saying the same
But I don't give a single damn
I wan't to try

You can abuse me baby
Do whatever is on your mind
I want to feel you really close
And then
I want to touch your hair
All over and over again

She really think she got it
She's got it

Red dress looks fine on you
But I bet you know that too
Some things stays the same
Can't get enough of you
As long you feel that too
There's nothing to change

You can abuse me baby
Do whatever is on your mind
I want to feel you really close
And then
I want to touch your hair
All over and over again

She really think she got it
She's got it

Honey I know that you can see that
She's got it
She really think she got it
She's got it
That is fine with me
And that is ok with me

It's not a lie to say
That I do not need a brake
I want to stay with you
And your hand on my hair
Your face and your smell
You belong to me do

I can hardly breath
When you're here with me
She really got it from God
I can hardly breath
When you're here with me
She really got it from God
I can hardly breath
When you're here with me
She really got it from God

She really think she got it
She's got it

Honey I know that you can see that
She's got it
She really think she got it
She's got it
That is fine with me
And that is ok with me
