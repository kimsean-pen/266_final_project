You think I'm good well I'm soil in a sifter
A stone won't fall through it just keeps getting thicker
Please take this back it has too much salt
I hope there's no trouble it's nobody's fault
Fault, fault, fault
You think I'm good so I'm almost done wanting
I'm suddenly full this is belonging
I've had too much fun when will it get taken
I love my secrets I'm lucky in making
Making, making, making
You think I'm good well I want to be gooder
I'm warmed by my own wool I lie to the others
Decide where I'm from they do what they like
It isn't important it isn't their life
Life, life, life, life, life
