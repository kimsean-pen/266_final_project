On a Sunday I'll think it through
On the drive back I'll think it through
What you wish for won't come true
Live with that, with that

And on a Sunday she thought that through
Now as I drive back, there's thirty six less hours
I have to change the course I send myself
I've gotta live with that, with that

The haze clears from your eyes
On a Sunday
The haze clears from your eyes
On a Sunday, on a Sunday

On a Sunday go once around
'Cause when the ride's done, the hopes that you have carried
They fall out from your hands back to the ground
Live with that, with that
They fall out from your hands back to the ground
Live with that, with that

The haze clears from your eyes
On a Sunday
The haze clears from your eyes
On a Sunday, on a Sunday

Learn as the drugs leave
Learn as you lose it you will
Learn as the drugs leave
Learn as you lose it you will

And the haze clears from your eyes
On a Sunday
The haze clears from your eyes
On a Sunday, on a Sunday yeah

The haze clears from your eyes
On a Sunday, on a Sunday yeah
The haze clears from your eyes
On a Sunday, on a Sunday, on a Sunday, on a Sunday
