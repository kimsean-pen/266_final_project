Far away there's a land of snow and sorrow
Time has made the frozen tears fall like rain from the starlit sky
And I feel so cold, I can't make it tomorrow
Oh, but the night will see where this path will lead my life
Endless field of snow at the edge of the world and the wailing
Winds so cold scar my face, I'm going insane
I am lost from the light - And the memories follow me in the night
I'm left in the arms of winter and I am carried far away - Far away

Night is falling over my home
The land of snow and sorrow, oh carry me away from the cold
And I fall asleep, I will dream the last dream
All I was, is gone now and sorrow is all I feel

And the white snow is falling from the starlit sky
And the stars are shining like your eyes
You are so beautiful
And I will follow them in this cold winter night
So I'd find my way to you this time

Drifting away from the warmth of the darkness
Caressed by the light of a million stars
The darkness will always be a part of my heart
Until I'm carried away by the winter's arms

Night is falling over my home
The land of snow and sorrow, oh carry me away from the cold
And I fall asleep and I will not be afraid
All I was, is gone now and sorrow is all I feel
