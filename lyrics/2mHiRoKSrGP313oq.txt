Boy 1 was famous from TV
He carved my name into a tree
First cut's the deepest and I left him bleeding

Boy 2 had earned a law degree
He charged me with a felony
I stole his heart and pled insanity

I know nothing lasts eternal in life
But love hurts forever

Boy 3 worked at the cemetery
His crooked smile was kinda sweet
All things must end, now he is 6 feet deep

Boy 4 was filthy rich indeed
He flew a private jet, but see
He crashed and burned, there's just no buying me

I know nothing lasts eternal in life
But love hurts forever

Every heart that's broken is a murder one
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done
Cause every heart that's broken is a murder one

Boy 5 composed a symphony
Strings and choir just for me,
Then he turned deaf; it was a tragedy

Boy 6 lived in a monastery
He chose a life of poverty
I chose Chanel; so much for chastity

I know nothing lasts eternal in life
But love hurts forever

Every heart that's broken is a murder one
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done
Cause every heart that's broken is a murder one

Every heart that's broken is a murder one
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done
Cause every heart that's broken is a murder one

Boy 7 was a Don of all Sicily
He tried to kiss and tell on me so now he
Sleeps with the fishes, arrived erci baby

Last boy was a director on a silver screen
He went and wrote a slasher flick just for me
When he said cut, I took it literally

Every heart that's broken is a murder one
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done
Cause every heart that's broken is a murder one

Every heart that's broken is a murder one
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done
Cause every heart that's broken is a murder one
