For one more poor boy
There's someone for he, for she
For one more poor boy
There's someone for him, for me

Your eyes resemble mine
You see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom
Speak of our peoples plan

Ill be here for my baby
For my baby Ill be near
So many things I need to tell you
Things you need to hear

So this is the aftermath
Your eyes resemble mine
You see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom
Speak of our people's plan

I'll be here for my baby
For my baby, I'll be near
So many things I need to tell you

For one more poor boy
There's someone for he, for she
For one more poor boy
There's someone for him, for me

For one more poor boy
There's someone for him, for she
For one more poor boy
There's someone for him, for me

Your eyes resemble mine
You see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom
Speak of our peoples plan

Ill be here for my baby
For my baby, Ill be near
So many things I need to tell you
Things you need to hear

How can I, how can I
How can I be sure?
In a world that's constantly changing
How can I be sure?

Just when I thought
I was winning
Just when I thought
I could not be stopped

Just when I thought
I was winning
Just when I thought
I could not be stopped
How can I be sure?
