There's a storm coming
I can see it in your eyes
There's a heartache showing
That you can't discuss
It's really tragic
i can see it in your face
You're losing something
That you can't replace

So hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
'Cause everything changes
It'll soon be gone
So hold on
Hold on
Just hold on
Hold on
'Cause everything changes
It'll soon be gone

There's a thunder rolling
And it's heading this way
There's a shadow showing
In everything that you say
There's a storm coming
I can see it in your eyes
Oh my heart is aching
You know ya'
You know you can't disguise

So hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
'Cause everything changes
It'll soon be gone

Oh but I, I, I
Will still be here
Oh and I, I, I
But I, I, I
Will still be here
Oh, hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Stick around and baby
It'll soon be gone

Hold on
Hold on
Just hold on
Everything changes
It'll soon be gone
