Take a step away from me, I love my enemies
You feel the energy, when you get next to me
I am the man now, I got a plan now, I got some bands now
I got some fans now, I got a whip now, I got a bitch now

Well if you don't comply than you cannot ride with a real ass guy like me nikes on the feet simplicity is key keep a distance when you talk to me
Cause I can't trust a soul nonetheless my own judgement (bitch)
There's no antidote for being this dope i woke up like this feeling' myself fuck your 360 I'm signing the radio disney feeling gorgeous when I'm recorded
Got the show jumping like I'm Jordan stupid for a fuck what you're saying bitch I need a manual, can't understand you, can't even stand
You I am an animal I am so valuable look at my capita (bitch look at my capita)

Take a step away from me, I love my enemies
You feel the energy, when you get next to me
I am the man now, I got a plan now, I got some bands now
I got some fans now, I got a whip now, I got a bitch now

I got a whip now, I got a whip now, I got a whip now
I got a bitch now, I got a bitch now, I got a bitch now
I got a whip now, I got a whip now, I got a whip now
I got a bitch now, I got a bitch now, I got a bitch now

Speak my mind never hold my tongue
Stay in line boy take your number
I've been hungry, I've been under, slowly commin' over with the rover
My boys seen me at my lowest, so they coming up with me
You ain't with us but you can witness this greatness like a bum with a blunt just face it boy
I've been on the rise, I've been on the side, I've been on the track
My hoes wait more to me still i put the whole city on my back
Back to back grab the mac attack anyone how lag
I'm still gon' fuck your hoe fuck what the fuck you think you know got your hood up my shit now like I'm still on the road

I got a whip now, I got a whip now, I got a whip now
I got a bitch now, I got a bitch now, I got a bitch now
I got a whip now, I got a whip now, I got a whip now
I got a bitch now, I got a bitch now, I got a bitch now

Take a step away from me, I love my enemies
You feel the energy, when you get next to me
I am the man now, I got a plan now, I got some bands now
I got some fans now, I got a whip now, I got a bitch now

I got a whip now, I got a whip now, I got a whip now
I got a bitch now, I got a bitch now, I got a bitch now
