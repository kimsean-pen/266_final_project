What's the use in wasting time
When we've finally found a home
Everybody's feeling fine
What's the use in wasting time

Cause I never listen to my own best advice,
Like one thing leads to another
Like one heart bleeds for another

And everybody wants what they can't have

You told me your best advice
You said stop and let it die
You told me your best advice
Don't you waste it all at once
