Grilled cheese
In my mouth
Get on your knees
If you want a bite, go fly a kite
Got the bread, got the cheese
Make me a grilled cheese please
Try and steal a bite
We'll get in a fight
Grilled cheese
In my mouth
Get on your knees
If you want a bite, go fly a kite
It's all about the butter [?] mother then make you another
Whoa

Grilled cheese
In my mouth
Grilled cheese
In my mouth
