"It's very difficult to keep the line between the past and the present,
you know what I mean?"

Honey, I'm a roller concrete clover, Tadzio, Tadzio
Arm wrestle your mother simply over, Tadzio, over you
But beware my heart can be a pin, a sharp silver dragonfly

Tryin' to get my mansions green
After I've Grey Gardens seen (gardens seen)

In between tonight and my tomorrows, Tadzio, where've you been
In between tonight, I know it's Tadzio
Tadzio, don't you fight
Honey can you hear me, in between
Been draggin' a dragonfly

Tryin' to my mansions green
After I've Grey Gardens seen (gardens seen)
Honey, won't you hold me tight (hold me tight)
Get me through Grey Gardens tonight

Tadzio, Tadzio
Tadzio, Tadzio

Tryin' to get my mansions green
After I've Grey Gardens seen (gardens seen)
Honey, won't you hold me tight (hold me tight)
Get my through Grey Gardens tonight

Tadzio, Tadzio
Tadzio, Tadzio
