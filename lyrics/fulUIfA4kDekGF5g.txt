Allison, put down your sword
Give up what you're fighting for
'Cause he's been waiting at the shore
His feet are in the water
He's waiting for an answer
If you've put in the water
But you're not on the sea

Ooh
Allison, I'll tell you something
You just broke this child's heart
'Cause he won't ever see those dreams
I'm waiting at the subway
Waiting for the next train
'Cause you're not on the next train
You're waiting for your own
You've been waiting for your own
You've been waiting for your own
You've been waiting for your own
You've been waiting for your own
