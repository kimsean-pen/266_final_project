I Can't Believe

It was you and me
Till there was no moe
I promised you love and trust
Why wasn't that enough
I kept hanging on
Hoping you would stay
I kept blaming myself
For making you lose faith
And I can't believe that
You've done this to me
Now i'm crying tears
Cause you were a lie
I wish that I never
Let you walk right in my life
My friends say be strong
They tell me move on
I gave you the best of me
And you threw it all away

And I can't believe that you've done this to me
And I can't believe that you've done this to me

Don't tell me that you and I
Are better off as friends
I don't believe a word you say
Cause you are just pretend
Where did you do, the man
That i truly love
You took him away from me
The day you walked away

And I can't believe that you've done this to me
And I can't believe that you've done this to me
