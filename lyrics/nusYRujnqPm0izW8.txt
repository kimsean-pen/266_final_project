I'm seein' this girl
And she just might be out of her mind
Well she's got baggage
And it's all the emotional kind

She talks about closure
And that validation bit
I don't mean to be insensitive
But I really hate that shit

And I said, yeah hey
Yeah hey
Oh man, she's got issues
And I'm gonna pay
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
She thinks she's the victim
Yeah

Now, I know she'll feel abandoned
If I don't stay over late
And I know she's afraid to commit
But it's only our second date

And I said, yeah hey
Yeah hey
Oh man she's got issues
And I'm gonna pay
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
She says, she's the victim
And she takes it all out on me

I don't know why you're messed up
I don't know why your whole life is a chore
Just do me a favour
And check your baggage at the door

Now she talks about her ex nonstop
But I don't mind
But when she calls out his name in bed
That's where I draw the line

You told me a hundred times
How your father left and he's gone
But I wish you wouldn't call me daddy
When we're gettin' it on

And I said, yeah hey
Yeah hey
Oh man, she's got issues
And I'm gonna pay
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
She's playin' the victim
And takin' it all out on me
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
My God, she's got issues
And I'm gonna pay
Gonna pay
Gonna pay
Gonna pay
Gonna pay
Gonna pay
Huh
Wow

If you think I'm controllin'
Then why do you follow me around
If you're not co-dependent
Then why do you let others drag you down

I don't know why you're messed up
I don't know why your whole life is a chore
Just do me a favour
And check your baggage at the door
