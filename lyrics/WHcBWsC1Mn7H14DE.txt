Planned a show
Trees and balloons
Ice cream snow
See you in June

Could have known
I would relive
Should have known
I would conceal

Your way, she knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
How's it she knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows

Colors show
After the moon
I should go
See you in June

Your way, she knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
How's it she knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows

Open your eyes to these must I lie?
Open your eyes to these must I lie?

Your way, she knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
How's it she knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
