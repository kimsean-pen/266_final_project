Louie, Louie, oh baby
Baby, Louie, Louie
Gotta sing my song
Louie, Louie, oh baby
Now Louie, Louie
Come on, help me sing this song

I walked down the street
On saturday night
I go to the joint
Where they're havin' a fight
I jump all around
I jump up and down
I can't find my baby
She can't be found, let's go

Louie, Louie, oh baby
Baby, Louie, Louie
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Louie, Louie, yeah baby
Louie, Louie

Come on, let's...

I love every girl
I see on the street
...
I'd like to meet
I walk around all day
And com the street
I know when the bitter
I went with the sweet, let's go

Louie, Louie, oh baby
Baby, Louie, Louie
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Louie, Louie, yeah baby
Louie, Louie

Let's go one more time
Here we go
Louie, Louie...
