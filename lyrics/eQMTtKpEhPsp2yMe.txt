I have been trying to get out of here
away from evil hate and endless fear
settle down take a feverish breath
to be free away from inevitable death

why do we live our failure to thrive
on singularity of humanity
tireless fight to feel alive
in a war that leads us to insanity

beyond this place full of doubts and tears
it looms ahead the horror of the shade,
eventhough the menace of the years
it will search and shall find me unafraid.

I hold you my dear
nothing to fear
salvation near
faith over your fear

to see beyond
a solid bond
I hold you my dear
nothing to fear

salvation near
another final frontier
to see and grief
what lies beneath
