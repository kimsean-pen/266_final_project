So, Y' been hangin with my ex all day, all day
Ya don't say
Thanks for taking what I threw away
I ain't fazed

Y' play these little games
Such a joke
Ain't even tuned in to your show
Oh, you think your claims are made of gold

But deep down everybody knows, knows
They be standin round tryin'a one you up
Ya' sensing every lie on the tip of their tongue

When you had enough gotta hit 'em wit de shrug like
They be standin round tryin'a one you up
Ya' sensing every lie on the tip of their tongue

When you had enough gotta hit 'em wit de shrug like
Hola, Hola, Hola, see you lookin' at me take a picture and don't be jelly
Girl, we ain't even friends, you just imaginary
This is gettin' old

Let it, let it go
Y' play these little games
Such a joke
Ain't even tuned in to your show
Oh, you think your claims are made of gold

But deep down everybody knows, knows
They be standin round tryin'a one you up
Ya' sensing every lie on the tip of their tongue

When you had enough gotta hit 'em wit de shrug like
They be standin round tryin'a one you up
Ya' sensing every lie on the tip of their tongue
When you had enough gotta hit 'em wit de shrug like

Oh, you think your claims are made of gold
But deep down everybody knows
Hit 'em wit de shrug like
Hit 'em wit de shrug like
They be standin round tryin'a one you up
Ya' sensing every lie on the tip of their tongue
When you had enough gotta hit 'em wit de shrug like
They be standin round tryin'a one you up
Ya' sensing every lie on the tip of their tongue
When you had enough gotta hit 'em wit de shrug like
