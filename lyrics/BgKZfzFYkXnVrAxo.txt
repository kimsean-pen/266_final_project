Go

Your words are just as simple as the next
You know my heart meant no disrespect
It seems that there is nothing left
No honor, no respect
Your mind is just as confused as the next
Keep your opinion to yourself

Go take your opinion with you
'Cause I dont want to hear it
Go take your decisions with you
'Cause I dont need to hear them
(You know exactly who you are)

Your voice is clawing at my ears all day
Leaving me restless and plaguing my mind
Your lies are clouding up my thoughts everyday
Seeing your motives realizing it's jealousy

No honor, no respect
No honor, no respect
(You know exactly who you are)

Your voice is clawing at my ears all day
Leaving me restless and plaguing my mind
Your lies are clouding up my thoughts everyday
Seeing your motives realizing it's jealousy

I can see right through you
I can see right through you

Go take your opinion with you
'Cause I don't want to hear it
Go take your decision with you
'Cause I dont need to hear them
Go
