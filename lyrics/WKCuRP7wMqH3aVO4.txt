It's a ugly day in Glendale
In a place that you once knew
Where you held that senile woman
That now has outlived you
I'm still taking it all in
I'm adapting to this loss
I wonder if she remembers you
How could she have forgotten

There's a crack in the shelf
And some light is shining through
As I sorted through the pieces
They told the stories I never knew

You left a hole in this earth
And you paid for it up front
I had to fill it with dirt
While your friend sang the song
May the lord
Mighty God
Bless and keep you forever
Grant you peace
Perfect peace
Courage in every endeavor

It was a sunny day in Norfolk
Next to the tree that caught your eye
I walked the ground you grew on
With my brother at my side
I'm still taking it all in
I'm adapting to this loss
People say that with time it gets easier
But I just think that they are wrong

You left a hole in this earth
And you paid for it up front
I had to fill it with dirt
While your friend sang the song
May the lord
Mighty God
Bless and keep you forever
Grant you peace
Perfect peace
Courage in every endeavor
