These things'll go slowly by
These things
They'll be where no-one would think
And when given this life
I ought've thanked you all who will take it away
I notice that you're fine
Setting up beside wherever turns a blind eye
Any solemn phase
And you belong at two times at once
My radios my heart
We live as one
Two ways at once
I know the waves I form
I know the way I won't become
These still places that are gone by
Believe they're somewhere else
(Believe they're somebody else)
Jumping in the mind of a passerby
And being replaced like times flies
Another wasted flaw
Going up against the endless law
I'm flown through a mirror
Almost disappearing
I glow faintly
You know this is nobodys life
I saw the days I lost
Hiding behind tomorrows costs
Time Goes Back
