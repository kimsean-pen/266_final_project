You can dance, every dance with the guy
That gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile, every smile for the man
That held your hand beneath the pale moonlight

But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me

Oh I know, that the music's fine
Like sparklin' wine, go and have your fun
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
Please, don't give your heart to anyone

And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Please darlin' save the last dance for me

Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it when we touch
I will never, ever let you go
I love you, oh so much

(Save, save it, save)
(Save, save it, save)

You can dance, go and carry on
Till the night is gone and it's time to go
If he asks, if you're all alone
Can he take you home, than you must tell him no

Please don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Please darling, save the last dance for me
Save the last dance for me

(Save, save it, save)
Save the last dance for me
(Save, save it, save)
Won't you save the last dance for me?
(Save, save it, save)
Baby, save the last dance for me!
(Save, save it, save)
