Kneel before craven decrees
Admonished from on high
Chained to a perception of flawless mortals
Within shrines of closed minds
The affliction of man
There are none immure
Cling to destructive ideals
To figments of rapture
Untill the final moment
None will concede
Straying from the passages wich we have carved ourselves
With indignation glaring from reflections
All that remains from the burdens of flowing blood
Are expanses of dust
Effigies of false purpose
Corroding
The final hours are not remorse
But for contempt
With ascendancy weighing down
Plead to the shrines
Release us
We must tie the ends of unknown
Withdraw into the pale
In this scantuary of death
revere the inertia
Resisting breath
Turn away all prayers
The collapse is owed to stagnation
Shrines of a paralysis
