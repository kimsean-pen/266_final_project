Ooh
You left me in chains
You left me in shackles, babe
In this open case
I wanna do you justice, babe
If I'm swearing under oath
I promise that I will take control
Nobody will ever hurt you, no
Just give me a second chance

I catch a felony for you
Whatever it takes to pay my dues
To show you my love is bulletproof
'Cause you are my crime and I'm your life

I want you, babe (Oh, yeah)
I want you back, baby (Oh, na-na-na)
I want you, babe (Oh, yeah)
I want you back, baby (Na-na-na)
I want you back (Want you back, want you back)
I want you back (Want you back, want you back)
I want you back
I want you, oh, ya-ya
I want you back, baby (Oh, na-na-na)

I'm doing my time
I know that I'm guilty, babe
But you've stolen my heart, oh
I'm under your jurisdiction, baby
Disturbing the peace when we go inside
If we talking sex, you're my partner in crime
Destroy anyone who'd bring you pain
My permanent record, babe
Let's start a new record, babe

I catch a felony for you
Whatever it takes to pay my dues
To show you my love is bulletproof
'Cause you are my crime and I'm your life

I want you, babe (Oh, yeah)
I want you back, baby (Oh, na-na-na)
I want you, babe (Oh, yeah)
I want you back, baby (Na-na-na)
I want you back (Want you back, want you back)
I want you back (Want you back, want you back)
I want you back
I want you, oh, ya-ya
I want you back, baby

I catch a felony for you
Whatever it takes to pay my dues
To show you my love is bulletproof
'Cause I am your life and you are my crime, oh

(You're my baby)
I want you back, baby (Oh, na-na-na)
I want you, baby (Oh, yeah)
I want you back, baby (Na-na-na)
I want you back (Want you back, want you back)
I want you back (Want you back, want you back)
I want you back
I want you, oh, ya-ya
I want you back, baby (Oh, na-na-na)

I want you back
I want you, oh, ya-ya
Oh, na-na-na
