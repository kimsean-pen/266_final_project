I can hear the echo
ringing in my head
in moments I remember
everything you said
I can hear the echo
ringing in my head
in moments I've been dreaming of
all night long
The conversation runs
through the end we've always started
I can hear the echo
Ringing in my head In moments I've been dreaming of all night long
No it don't matter to me
I can hear the echo
I can hear the echo
ringing in my head
in moments I remember
everything you said I can hear the echo
ringing in my head
in moments I've been dreaming of
all night long
The conversation runs
through the end we've always started
I can hear the echo
Ringing in my head In moments I remember
trying to call me back
No it don't matter to me
I'll make you believe
I can hear the echo
Now is there a way
some movement I'd make
There's something to recreate here again
Not something to give
Just something I lost
Where has it gone
Cause I can hear the echo
