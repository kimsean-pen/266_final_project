I don't want nobody
If i can't have you
oh i can't love nobody
unless i'm loving you

chorus:
the way you hug me
the way you squeeze me
the way you kiss me
ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
if i can't have you

i can't talk to nobody
unless i'm talking to you
i don't wanna hold nobody
unless i'm holding you

chorus

i can't be kissing nobody
unless i'm kissing you
i just don't i just don't i just don't want to be bothered with nobody
unless i'm bothered with you

chorus
