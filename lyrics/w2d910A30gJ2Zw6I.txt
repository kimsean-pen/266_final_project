Sleeping dragon
Now wide awake
Poisoned mind
Ignited by the infected beat, the stomping feet, and an axe to grind

Oh yeah
Fuck it all
Turn it up

Come on

Fuck it all, cut the cord, scream for more
Turn it up, throw it down, bleed for more
Give it all you got and never fold
Axe to grind

Fuck it all, cut the cord, scream for more
Turn it up, throw it down, bleed for more
Give it all you got and never fold
Never hold back

Axe to grind
Swing and swing wild
Axe to grind

Sleeping dragon
Now wide awake
Poisoned mind
Ignited by the infected beat, the stomping feet, and an axe to grind

Breaking your neck walking the line
Burn all the rest wasting no time
Throw it down
Cut the cord
Break your neck
Walk the line
Burn all the rest wasting no time

Sleeping dragon now wakes

Axe to grind
Swing and swing wild
Axe to grind
Swing and swing wild

Take me
Take me

Give it all you got and never fold

Fuck it all, cut the cord, scream for more
Turn it up, throw it down, bleed for more
Give it all you got and never fold
Sleeping dragon

Fuck it all, cut the cord, scream for more
Turn it up, throw it down, bleed for more
Give it all you got and never fold
Axe to grind
