Woah-o, woah-o, yeah, yeah
Woah-o, woah-o, yeah, yeah
You say I'm looking really bad
you say I'm looking really sick

And I don't even care
I never really did
So when push comes to shove
and I slap you in the face

Just remember one thing...
When its time to fill the void
my whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says my Time Is Running Out

I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender
So when I'm out of control
and I'm out of my mind

Just remember one thing
I think I'm just fine
So catch me when I fall
I won't remember a thing at all

So catch me when I fall
When its time to fill the void
my whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says my Time Is Running Out

I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender
Woah-o, woah-o, yeah, yeah

Woah-o, woah-o, yeah, yeah
When its time to fill the void
my whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says my Time Is Running Out
When its time to fill the void
my whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says my Time Is Running Out
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender
