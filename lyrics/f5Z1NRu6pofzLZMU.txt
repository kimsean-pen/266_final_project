Each evening the sun sets in five billion places
Seen by ten billion eyes set in five billion faces
Then they close in a daze and wait for the dawning
But the daylight and sunrise
Are brighter in our eyes
Where night cannot devour golden solar power
Once we were damned now I guess we are angels
For we passed though the dark and eluded the dangers
Then I awoke with a start to startling changes
All the tension is ended
The sentence suspended
And darkness now sparkles and gleams
And it all seems larger than life to me
I find it rather hard to believe
So I stand as the sound goes straight through my body
I'm so bloated up, happy, I can throw things around me
And I'm growing in stages, and have been for ages
Just singing and floating and free
It's a heavenly pop hit
If anyone wants it
It's a heavenly pop hit
It's something that we're humming as
We swoop low on trees, or we sweep under carpets
We can dive into suns though its not recommended
We can hover, silent, and listen, closely.
It all seems (all seems)
Larger than life to me
I find it (find it)
Hard to believe
So where was our home
Well, our home was in tears
For it's fruit has gone bad
They'd been that way for years
Yet their lives are elastic
They should be fantastic
They should be expanding
It's a heavenly pop hit
If anyone wants it
It's a heavenly pop hit
For anybody
Oh, for those that still want it
