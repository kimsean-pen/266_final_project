I still walk in that bar a little drunk
I still ask you what you're drinkin' what's your name
I still kiss you by the shuffleboard, last call at 2am
Even though we break up in the end

I'd introduce you to my mom and dad
Say "I think I love her" when you leave that room
I still might take their advice when I say you're movin' in
Even though we break up in the end

Even if I knew you'd be the one that got away
I'd still go back and get you
Even if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake
Oh, I'd still make it with you
Over and over, again and again
Even though we break up in the end

I'd still play my favorite song in your car
Let you love me to it, 'til it felt like ours
Now all I hear is you in it, but I'd still let you ruin it
Even though we break up in the end

Even if I knew you'd be the one that got away
I'd still go back and get you
Even if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake
Girl, I'd still make it with you
Over and over, again and again
Even though we break up in the end

You've just had one too many tonight
You're just callin' 'cause you're lonely, that's okay
But you know if you come over, I cannot let you in
Even though we'll break up in the end
I'd do it over and over, again and again
Even though we break up in the end
