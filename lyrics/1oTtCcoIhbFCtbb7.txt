I don't give in that easy
So don't play games to tease me, no way
No no, no way
I look like I don't bother
Cause I know you don't love her, no way
No no, no way

Slow down, pick it up, bring it up
Slow down, take your time, do it fine
We got something
We sure got something, yeah
Lay down, pick it up, bring it up
Lay down, give it time, do it fine
All or nothing right now

Too late
Baby it's never too late
'Cause I like the way you touch me, love me, hold me now
Too late
Baby it's never too late
'Cause I like the way you touch me, love me, hold me now
Too late
Too late

If what they say is true
About what love can do, there's no way
No no, no way
We have a chance let's take it
We don't have to fake it, no way
No no, no way

Slow down, pick it up, bring it up
Slow down, take your time, do it fine
We got something
We sure got something, yeah
Lay down, pick it up, bring it up
Lay down, give it time, do it fine
All or nothing right now

Too late
Baby it's never too late
'Cause I like the way you touch me, love me, hold me now
Too late
Baby it's never too late
'Cause I like the way you touch me, love me, hold me now
Too late
Too late

It's not too late to turn the time
If you want me by your side
Touch me, love me, show me how

Too late
Baby it's never too late
'Cause I like the way you touch me, love me, hold me now
Too late
Baby it's never too late
'Cause I like the way you touch me, love me, hold me now
Too late
