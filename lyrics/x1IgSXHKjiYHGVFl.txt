She's got a target painted on her back
And keeps a list of the qualities a good girl lacks.
She bites her lip and tips her bottle
I take a drink cause the truth is hard to swallow.
Oh, oh, oh

Sex and white lies
Handcuffs and alibis
She lays her halo on the pillow where she sleeps...
Her heart beats, red wine
My toxic valentine.
Lays her halo on her pillow that used to be mine.
Oh, oh.

I live a lifestyle full of first impressions.
I've got my hands full of unhealthy obsessions.
She bites my lip, I'm sure to follow.
We take a drink to the guilty and the hollow.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Sex and white lies
Handcuffs and alibis
She lays her halo on the pillow where she sleeps.
Her heart beats, red wine
My toxic valentine.
Lays her halo on her pillow that used to be mine.

Oh, oh.
My toxic valentine
Oh, oh.
My toxic valentine.

I'm not the type to forget or to bury my head.
Just take off your wings
They could never get you quite as high as I do
And you know it.

Sex and white lies
Handcuffs and alibis
She lays her halo on the pillow where she sleeps...
Her heart beats, red wine
My toxic valentine.
Lays her halo on her pillow that used to be...

Sex and white lies
Handcuffs and alibis
She lays her halo on the pillow where she sleeps...
Her heart beats, red wine
My toxic valentine.
Lays her halo on her pillow that used to be...
She lays her halo on her pillow that used to be mine.
