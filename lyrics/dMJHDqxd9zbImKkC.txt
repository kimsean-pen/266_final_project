Lose me on the way
I've got a price to pay
Till I hear the northern (side?)
All the world's a flame
this heart will never be the same
She's the flower in your eyes

What a fool of heart
Such a fool of heart
What a fool of heart
Such a fool...

Lose me on the way
She's the flower in your eyes (now?)
All the world's a flame
this heart will never be the same
Never...
