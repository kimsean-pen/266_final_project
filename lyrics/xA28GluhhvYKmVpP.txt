All the way from Waco to WE-HO
With a rabbit on a chain
Drove her little slick car to ten bar
With the static on her brain
She's a little burner, burner,
gonna throw you to the flame
Leave a ticking time bomb,
time bomb gonna blow us all away

Ohohoho
Take the time to waste a moment
Ohohoho
Never ask to be forgiven

Sexy was her boyfriend, with no kin,
Always running from the law
Every other weekend, weekends
With his back at her claw
He's a live wire, wire,
Shooting sparks in the night
He's a little higher, higher,
With the beat in his sights

Ohohoho
Take the time to waste a moment
Facing where the lines are broken
Ohohoho
Name a price to all this living
Ohohoho
Never ask to be forgiven

Ohohoho
Take the time to waste a moment
Facing where the lines are broken
Ohohoho
Name a price to all this living
Ohohoho
Never ask to be forgiven
