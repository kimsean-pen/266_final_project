Well, I know it's the night
But have you gotta beat the daylights out of me
I'm getting so god-damned bruised
I'll soon, I'll soon be softer than a stoned cherry

And when you let your flesh creep over me
You know I don't know what's come over me
Something about the way you drool and kiss
That makes love, makes love seem nothing like this

You tear me up, you grab what's mine
You tear me up every single time
You tear me up, what a hideous crime
You tear me up, you're a bloody swine

All this slurping and sucking
You know it's putting me off my food
You're noisier than a motorway
About two times, you're a three times as rude

You know, you got such big eyes
They make me feel so small
My heart is only one mouthful
But you, yeah you, you can have it all

You tear me up, you grab what's mine
You tear me up every single time
You tear me up, what a hideous crime
You tear me up, you're a bloody swine

And you know you're just as hard as a pavement
And I don't know where my passion went
You think that maybe I should walk on you
You'd make a damned good anesthetic, I'll say that for you

You tear me up, you grab what's mine
You tear me up every single time
You tear me up, what a hideous crime
You tear me up, you're a bloody swine
You're a bloody swine, you're a bloody swine
You're a bloody swine, you're a bloody swine
