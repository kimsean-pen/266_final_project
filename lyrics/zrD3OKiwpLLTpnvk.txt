I can be as angry as I want to be
Just watch me burn (need to be motivated)
I think you're way to cold
Just watch and learn

I'll never sleep here anymore
My house is not my home
I like you better dead
I'm better off alone

Destiny will you cure me?
Trust will you age with me?
Hear me scream as I face tomorrow

Your vision may be in colour but you look all pale
In these times we should be learning but with you I'll always fail

I need to save myself before i drown it took so long to see
The world your mind creates
It Pushes me under
