The old enemies are dead and long gone, my friend
You are like the boy who cried wolf
A voice buried in another decade's fears
And those songs you sang, to what end?

We are the ghosts among the ruins
Without history, without nation
And without names

How you silenced with joy the words of noble men
Tear down the statues and burn the books
Strike their deeds from history
And turn the clocks to nought
And let year zero begin on my watch

We are the ghosts among the ruins
Without history, without nation
And without names

Remember when I said war was coming?
You hear the engines grinding fast
Express growing louder
We are grinding louder

Pray for me
You pray on your deathbed
You pray for me

We are exiled among the ruins
And we are ghosts among the ruins
Without history, without nations
Without names, without a future

We are the ghosts among the ruins
Without history, without a future
