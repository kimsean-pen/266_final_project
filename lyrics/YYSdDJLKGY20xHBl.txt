Walked back home from this disaster
Saw your ghost under the plaster
Heart's in throat and broken to pieces
I'm coming home

Lost my way and gave up my treasure
Hid my heart and lost you forever
There's flesh in you that won't know her father
I can't come home

Loved you first when we were children
You broke my heart but all that's forgiven
We lost our chance to love one another
We'll love again just not each other
