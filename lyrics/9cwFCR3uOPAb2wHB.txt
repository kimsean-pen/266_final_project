I don't care about a fancy car
Unless it's taking me to you
And I don't care about how far you are
You know I'll always come through for you

I don't want to miss another birthday party
Or any day in between
I picture us holding hands when we're older
Though its probably just a dream

Cus life is so busted
Life is so busted
My car is so busted
Life I'm so busted

And I just wanted to be loved
By you by you
I just wanted to be loved
By you by you
I just wanted to be loved
By you by you
I just wanted to be loved
By you by you
I just wanted to be loved
By you
I just wanted to be loved
By you by you
I just wanted to be loved
By you
I just wanted to be loved
By you
