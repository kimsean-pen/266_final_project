I see the writing on the wall
I was playing it too safe
Playing it too safe is dangerous

All the things that kept me going
Was all the things that slowed me down
I see the writing on the wall

I thought it was here, but it's not my fault
You said it was there, but it's not over there
Oh, fuck yeah
It's gonna be somewhere you'll see

I don't wanna know
Guess we could make up stuff to talk about
Whoa

I wanna put you in my crocodile mouth
And drag you to the, right over my swamp
Oh, fuck yeah
It's gonna be something to see

I don't really know where I'm going
Not sure that I wanna be knowing
Everyone does, you only name it boring life
I was playing it too safe I see
Playing it too safe is dangerous
Maybe not for me but for them

People who do not do anything know
Exactly where all the time has gone
Oh, fuck yeah
They're gonna be happier maybe

People in the wrong bodies
Mine is broken like a heart
Drive a highway through you
Like a rainbow arc
It's all over there
Oh, somewhere
It's gonna be, cheap maybe free

Stay a while
I never wanted it to go that way
Say it in a while

Those things right through the moon
Oh we could think of things to talk about
Save it in a pile
Whoa
