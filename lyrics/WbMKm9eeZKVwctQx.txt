Treat me like a fool
Treat me mean and cruel
But love me, do, do, do

Wring my faithful heart
Tear it all apart
But love me

(Won't you love me?)
If you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
Praying on my knees
All I ask is please
Please, please
Love me

I would beg and steal
(Beg and steal)
Just to feel
(Just to feel)
Your warm heart
(I want your heart)
Beatin' close to mine
(So close to mine)

Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear only
Ooh, oooh, oooh

I would beg and steal
(He would beg and steal)
Just to feel
(Yes, just to feel)
Your warm heart
(I want your heart)
Beatin' close to mine
(So close to mine)

Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
Beggin' on my knees
All I ask is please, please love me
Oh yeah

Hey DJ
Thank You
Don't fight, don't fight
That's better than grabbing
Your shirt anyway...

(About the,
About the new music of today)

(About the new music of today
Everything has improved over the last
ten or twelve years
Sound has improved
The musicians have improved
The engineers have improved
The overall sound is much better
I think today
But it all stemmed basically
From gospel music or rhythm and blues
And that's where I got my style of
Singing from was rhythm and blues
And gospel
Mixed with Country and Western
And that's about it baby
That's all I gotta say

(Stay with me)

They trying to get the DJ to move
So that...
Don't hurt the drummer

(They got me trapped here)
