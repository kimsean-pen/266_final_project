You wasted your summer
On nothing but drugs
We're killing each other
Who gives a fuck

I want a new high
Don't ask me why
You want a new high
Give it a try

When will you recognize
This world was built off lies?
It should be no surprise
No need to cry

I want a new high
Don't ask me why
You want a new high
Give it a try

Don't tell me how to live my life
Don't tell me what happen when you die

I want a new high
Don't ask me why
You want a new high
Give it a try
I want a new high
