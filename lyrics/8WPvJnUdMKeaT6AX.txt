So maybe I was wrong, I couldn't leave it dead
I never felt so alone I think I'm seeing red
We'll never be the same, I see it missing
I hate the way that you are but we're not that different
Face in the mirror I'm okay now, I'm okay now
Least that's what I'll keep telling myself on the way down, on the way down
Maybe I'm to blame, can't help what I'm thinking
Least that's what I'll keep telling myself but I'll keep singing
Cut down like it's all tradition
Heart rate, can you see it missing
Step back, I won't admit that maybe I'm broken, I won't listen
Cut down like it's all tradition
Heart rate can you see it missing
Leave it, I don't want to be that, I don't want to be the one left bleeding
But now I'm stuck tailored to this suit of broken skin
So maybe I was wrong I couldn't leave it dead
I never felt so alone I think I'm seeing red
We'll never be the same, I see it missing
I hate the way that you are but we're not that different
Am I worth fixing, is all I really have to say
Take in my perspective or I can find myself a way
Breaking down the structure of my soul until I can see
Everything so resilient, showing proof that I can breathe
Just know that I'll keep singing, I'll keep breathing
My reflection is all I'm missing
I'll keep singing, I'll keep breathing
My reflection is all I'm missing
So maybe I was wrong I couldn't leave it dead
I never felt so alone I think I'm seeing red
We'll never be the same, I see it missing
I hate the way that you are but we're not that different
