I know there are some things
About you I don't know
So many so many sides we
Haven't seen
If we get the chance to be alone, baby
So much so much that I would
Like to know

Show me you're the way
Show me the right way
Show me, love me
See me, perfectly
Show me, Show me.

I don't I don't know how to
Behave, baby
When you see that you had me
All along

I want to feel
I want to feel

Show me you're the one
Show me you're my only

Show me you're the way
Show me the right way
Show me, love me
See me, perfectly
Show me, Show me...
