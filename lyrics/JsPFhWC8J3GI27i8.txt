18 'til I die

I wanna be young the rest of my life
Never say no, try anything twice
'Till the angels come, and ask me to fly
I'm gonna be 18 'til I die, 18 'til I die

Can't live forever, that's wishful thinkin'
Whoever said that, must have been drinkin'
Don't wanna grow up, I don't see why
I couldn't care less if time flies by

18 'til I die, 18 'til I die
It sure feels good to be alive
Someday I'll be 18 goin' on 55
18 'til I die, all righ'

Anyway, I just wanna say
Why bother with what happened yesterday?
That's not my style, I live for the minute
If you wanna stay young, get both feet in it

18 'til I die, a little bit of this, a little bit of that
Little bit of everything, got you out on track
It's not how you look, it's what you feel inside
I don't care when I don't need to know why

18 'til I die, 18 'til I die
Sure feels good to be alive
Someday I'll be 18 goin' on 55
18 'til I die

'Cause one thing for sure
I'm sure gonna try

Don't worry about the future
Forget about the past
We're gonna have a ball, yeah
Gonna have a blast, we'll make it last

18 'til I die, 18 'til I die
I'm gonna be 18 'til I die
18 'til I die, 18 'til I die
18 'til I die, 18 'til I die
