I'm tired of beeing the odd man out
I speak with a whisper and feel with a shout
I feel out of tune, I feel out of key
I feel like I'm missing a part of me

I've got a lot on my head
And my condition's read
I think I'm better off dead
Sometimes

Some people say that lightning never strikes twice
But I've been hit more than once in my life
I've been taken in so many times
A thousaint promises, a thousaint lies

I've got a lot on my head
And my condition's read
I think I'm better off dead
Sometimes, sometimes

Sometimes I take a look at the world
And sometimes I take a look at the girls
I'm just a spectator, I don't get involved
I've got too many problems of my own to solve

I've got a lot on my head
And my condition's read
I think I'm better off dead
Sometimes
I've got a lot on my head
And my condition's read
I think I'm better off dead
Sometimes, sometimes
