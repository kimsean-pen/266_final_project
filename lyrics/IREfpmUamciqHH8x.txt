The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

Here we are at the end of the road
A road that's quietly caving in.
Come so far to pretend that we don't
Don't miss where we started.

Lookin' back, I see a setting sun
And watch my shadow fade into the floor.
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering how we got this far
How we got this far.

They left us alone,
The kids in the dark
To burn out forever,
Or light up a spark
We come together,
State of the art
We'll never surrender,
The kids in the dark

So let the world sing
What a shame
(Hey)
What a shame

(Hey)
Beautiful scars on,
Critical veins
We come together,
State of the art
We'll never surrender,
The kids in the dark
The kids in the dark

(The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)

Here we are at the top of the hill
A hill that's quietly crumbling.

Been awhile since you dressed for the kill
The kill that sent me tumbling

Looking up, I see a falling star
And watch it's fire burn into the floor.
And I am left, standing on the edge
Wondering why we fall so hard

Why we fall so hard.

They left us alone,
The kids in the dark
To burn out forever,
Or light up a spark
We come together,
State of the art

We'll never surrender,
The kids in the dark
So let the world sing
What a shame
(Hey)

What a shame
(Hey)
Beautiful scars on,
Critical veins
We come together,
State of the art

We'll never surrender,
The kids in the dark
The kids in the dark
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
(Whoa)
(Whoa)

They left us alone,
The kids in the dark
To burn out forever,
Or light up a spark
We come together,
State of the art
We'll never surrender,
The kids in the dark
So let the world sing
What a shame
(Hey)
What a shame
(Hey)
Beautiful scars on,
Critical veins
We come together,
State of the art
We'll never surrender,
The kids in the dark
The kids in the dark

The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark.

We'll never surrender
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
