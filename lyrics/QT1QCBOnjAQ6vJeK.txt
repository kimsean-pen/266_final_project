There's a tear in my lover's eyes
He's at my window, it's a gloomy night
Said he dreamt of God's search light
It remembered his name
Lays his hand gently to my face
Through the promise of wedding lace
And I feel his dark embrace
As my baby, he cries

I'm falling in love
(Don't say goodbye)
I'm falling like a star from above
(Don't say goodbye)
And I finally found my pot of gold
(Don't say goodbye)
And now I can't see just what my heart can hold
But what does it mean?
The bad things that I've seen

He saw angels at his bedroom door
And a body on a checkered floor
There was lightning in his black leather
And it struck out his name
No more tears, baby, please don't cry
I tried to tell him everything is fine
Cross my heart and hope to die
I won't say goodbye

Cause I'm falling in love
(Don't say goodbye)
I'm falling like a star from above
(Don't say goodbye)
And I finally found my pot of gold
(Don't say goodbye)
And now I can't see just what my heart can hold
But what does it mean?
The bad things that I've seen

Oh, what does it mean?
The bad things that I've seen
What does it mean?
The bad things that I've seen
