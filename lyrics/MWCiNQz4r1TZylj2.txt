Ladies and gentlemen,
we interrupt our program of dance music to bring you a special
bulletin from the intercontinental radio news.
Our very own Pop Princess, now Queen of Pop,
has a special announcement she would like to make.
You're on

I think I'm ready for my closeup
Yeah
You don't like me, I don't like you

It don't matter (Ooh)
Only difference: you still listen
I don't have to (Ooh)
In one ear and out the other
I don't need ya (Ooh)
Your words don't stick, I ain't perfect
But you ain't either (Ooh)
If you're feelin' groggy, leave (Ooh)

I ain't even losin' sleep (Ooh)
There's more to me than what you see (Ooh)
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry
Mister photographer

I think I'm ready for my closeup
Tonight
Make sure you catch me from my good side
Pick one
These other hoes just wanna be me
Is that money in your pocket or you happy to see me?
Kill the lights

Take 'em out, turn 'em off, break 'em down
Kill the lights
Don't be scared, make a move, see me now
Kill the lights
I feel you, watching me, watching you
Kill the lights
You can't handle the truth, what happened to him?
I killed the lights, the lights, the lights (Pure satisfaction)

I killed the lights, the lights, the lights (Lights, camera, action)
I killed the lights, the lights, the lights (Pure satisfaction)
I killed the lights, the lights, the lights (Lights, camera, action)
All the flashin', tryin' to cash in

Hurts my eyes
All the poses, out of focus
I despise
"F" me over, your exposure
Not the best
You want me bad, watch how I
Relieve this stress

I killed the lights, the lights, the lights (Pure satisfaction)
I killed the lights, the lights, the lights (Lights, camera, action)
You're the star now

Welcome to the big league
They all want a pic
They all wanna see, see
See what you're made of
What you're gonna do
Is life gonna get
The best of you?
Kill the lights

Take 'em out, turn 'em off, break 'em down
