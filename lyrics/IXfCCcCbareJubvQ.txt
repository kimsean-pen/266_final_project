I'm useless and I know it
Auditory hallucination
You said I don't care what I'm thinking about
But I'm thinking of you right now

Night time is my time
dreamin' of moving
Falling in space

So will i sit down?
Or go faster and faster?
Into the maybe
Slow down
Right now

I wouldn't feel anything
When we burst into dust forever
And no angels will help us out
'Cause they've all gone

Night time is my time
I'm dreaming of moving
Falling in space

So will i sit down?
Or go faster and faster?
Into the maybe
Slow down
Right now

Faster and faster
I'm going faster and faster
I'm going faster and faster
I'm going faster and faster
I'm going faster and faster
I'm going faster and faster
Faster and faster and faster
