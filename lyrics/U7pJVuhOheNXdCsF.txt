I've never felt so empty, does anything exist left in the dark?
I never liked pretending, but you had me believing from the start

Feels like you left me out so you could let them in

Feels like you didn't need a reason
To stab me in the back again
None of this makes any sense
Those words it's clear you didn't mean them
Reality keeps stepping in
I pray this won't come back again
Phase me out of the picture
Feels like you left me out so you could let them in

...But when I fall asleep I think of you, not of your twisted game for two
And every time I blink I know it's true... there's nothing I can do...

Feels like you left me out so you could let them in
Feels like you left me out so you could let yourself in

Feels like you didn't need a reason
To stab me in the back again
None of this makes any sense
Those words it's clear you didn't mean them
Reality keeps stepping in
I pray this won't come back again
Phase me out of the picture
Feels like you left me out so you could let them in

You needed something, you needed something more
Get out of my head, out of my head
Infectious things you said
You needed something, you needed something more

Feels like you didn't need a reason
To stab me in the back again
None of this makes any sense
Those words it's clear you didn't mean them
Reality keeps stepping in
I pray this won't come back again
Phase me out of the picture
Feels like you left me out so you could let them in
