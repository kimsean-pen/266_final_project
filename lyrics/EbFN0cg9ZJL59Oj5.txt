I will provide just what you need
Exotic fruits, delicious treats
Control your mind, it's mine to keep
Now stick your tongue between my teeth
I talk so smooth but cut so deep
I'm hurting you, bruise like a peach
I am the best you've ever seen
You don't know how I do it but know what I'll be giving you

Hold on, hold on
Something fishy's going on
But everything just feels so right
Hold on, hold on
Something fishy's going on
But everybody feels

Through these words I choose to speak
We feel the gods smile down on me
See once I did the magic trick
Caught you off guard I'm just too quick, just too quick

If I said I remembered what your name was I'd be lying
Told you my real name then I was lying
Yes, I can keep this bullshit up all night
Yes I can, don't you know
Hold on, hold on
Something fishy's going on
But everything just feels so right
Hold on, hold on
Something fishy's going on
But everybody feels so right
Make love, now we make love
Now you're making love with me now, making love with me now
Make love, now we make love
Now you're making love with me now, making love with me now

Said I remembered what your name was I'd be lying
Told you my real name then I was lying
Talkin saucy nonsense 'til the end of time
And don't we know
If you said you knew a single truth about me you'd be lying
If we said we felt a real connections we'd be lying
Yes, we can keep this bullshit up all night
Yes we can, don't we know

Hold on, hold on
Something fishy's going on
But everything just feels so right
Hold on, hold on
Something fishy's going on
But everybody feels so right
Make love, now we make love
Now you're making love with me now, making love with me now
Make love, now we make love
Now you're making love with me now, making love with me now
Hold on, hold on
Make love, now we make love
Now you're making love with me now, making love with me now
