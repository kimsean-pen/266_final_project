Let me show you the way
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Let me show you the way

Didn't I make a good lady, didn't I have your baby
Maybe I should've known you were crazy
When you was caught playin' me shady

Didn't I keep your kids when you were out smokin' and drinkin'
Why did I treat you like my king
When you were out doing your own thing
(Let me show you the way)

Tell ya what I think about you, you're tired and confused
And I want nothing to do with you, tell you what you think about me
You think that I'm crazy, you think that I am dumb and naive
(Let me show you the way)

Let me break it down, let me show you how I'mma put you out
Watch me show and prove, how to play my moves and get rid of you

You can pack your things, you can take this ring, it don't mean a thing
(Let me show you the way)
To the front door 'cause I can't take no more, I can't take no more

(Let me show you the way)
Didn't I show you this good love, didn't I do it just because
Tell me why you went and did me wrong
I heard you sayin' you love her on the phone

I know I told you and even when you put me through it
Why didn't I listen to my girlfriends when they said you were not worth it
(Let me show you the way)

Tell ya what I think about you, you're tired and confused
And I want nothing to do with you, tell you what you think about me
You think that I'm crazy, you think that I am dumb and naive
(Let me show you the way)

Let me break it down, let me show you how I'mma put you out
Watch me show and prove, how to play my moves and get rid of you
(Let me show you the way)

You can pack your things, you can take this ring, it don't mean a thing
(Let me show you the way)
To the front door 'cause I can't take no more, I can't take no more
(Let me show you the way)

Let me show you the way
Uh, yeah, ah, ha

Since you went and broke the rules, this is what I got for you
Take your jacket and your shoes, you'll never play me for a fool
(Let me show you the way)

Tell ya what I think about you, you're tired and confused
And I want nothing to do with you, tell you what you think about me
You think that I'm crazy, you think that I am dumb and naive
(Let me show you the way)

Let me break it down, let me show you how I'mma put you out
Watch me show and prove, how to play my moves and get rid of you
(Let me show you the way)

You can pack your things, you can take this ring, it don't mean a thing
(Let me show you the way)
To the front door 'cause I can't take no more, I can't take no more
(Let me show you the way)

Let me show you the way

Let me break it down, let me show you how I'mma put you out
Watch me show and prove, watch me make my moves and get rid of you

You can pack your things, you can take this ring, it don't mean a thing
To the front door 'cause I can't take no more, I can't take no more
(Let me show you the way)

Let me show you the way, uh
'Cause life you know
Let me show you the way
