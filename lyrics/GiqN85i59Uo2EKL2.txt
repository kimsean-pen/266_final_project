Pacing aimlessly
With my mind is (at) unrest
Unsure of what may come
What have I done to bring this down on me?
Helpless to make this undone

All in due time
See the world through different eyes
All in due time
The shadows will give way to light

How much more can I give of myself
As these walls close in on me?
As I slip down into this despair (into this despair)
There is nothing to attain
What victory (what victory)
When my soul is weak (is weak)
Where does my help come from?

All in due time
See the world through different eyes
I see the world through different eyes
All in due time
Shadows will give way
Give way to light

All that we suffer through leads to determination
The trials we all go through gives us the strength to carry on
Something within us burns
Desire feeds the will to live
A reason to believe I will see redemption

All in due time
See the world through different eyes
I see the world through different eyes
All in due time
The shadows will give way to light
All in due time
