And we trudged along through the mud
We tried to call it home
We weren't alright, not at all
Not for one, for one, for one second

Never have
Been one to write it down
Now I think I can
I know I'm stronger now

Who's looking south?
Not me, I'm not looking back
I'm done denying the truth to anyone
'Cause I'm alive

And we trudged along through the mud
We tried to call it home
But we weren't alright, not at all
Not for one, for one, for one second

Showed me how
You seemed to find a hole
But I just laughed and smiled
Begged and rolled my eyes

Even cried
Denied the truth to you
Just like the truth to me
Mostly lied

I'm not going to look back
I'm not going to look back
I'm not going to look back
I'm not going to look back

White it out
Glittering
Wax butterflies
(Butterflies, butterflies)

Never have
Been one to write it down
Now I think I can
I know I'm stronger now

Who's looking south?
Not me, I'm not looking back
I'm done denying the truth to anyone
'Cause I'm alive

I'm not going to look back
I'm not going to look back
I'm not going to look back

I'm not going to look back
I'm not going to look back
I'm not going to look back
I'm not going to look back
