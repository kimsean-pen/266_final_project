This county road
I've fallen away
I've fallen away
This country road

To a place unknown
I traveled away
I traveled away
I fall into nothin'

The sea side road
Has fallen away
Has fallen away
I have to go

My place is sold
I've fallen away
I've fallen away
I fall into nothin'

The sky has turned again
You can't fight
And you won't die
Memory

It's tearing you apart
You won't run
And you can't die
Memory

The sunset gold
I've fallen away
I've fallen away
I've traded away

A sea side day
It's fallen away
It's fallen away
Fallin' into nothing

The sky has turned again
You can't fight
And you won't die
Memory

It's tearing you apart
You won't run
And you can't die
Memory

I promise you with warm salt air
Hallowed breezes in your hair
Days on end and days long gone
The beach and the fires and the nights are gone

Flow, tide, ebb, road
Night, sky, sand, home
The fair in the park
By the sea in my heart is never gone
