Now we've arrived in a new time and world and elements are we of gold
How many times were we able to see the infinite void of the soul?
All that way gonna give it away?
You're gonna give it away to some muscle?
Long, long way till the pain is at bay, so hit it one more time!
Fight!
Along that way got the temper at bay finding new ways to loosen the load
And we will settle the day when the son will obey and the gods of it all will implode
Long, long way you're-a-giving away, you're gonna give it away to the muscle
You've come a long, long way so be not afraid you've gotta use your mind!

Alien world
Arrogant mental
This world seems arrogant, sick and demented
Alien world
So you bet your body and soul!

It hurts so much and that is why they fear it
But never fear, all is here!
It hurts so much and that is why we fear it
But pay no mind,
Rejoice!

Don't fear it!
Don't fear it!

I know you'll follow,
I know your war

It hurts so much and that is why they fear it
But never fear, all is here!
It hurts so much and that is why we fear it
But pay no mind,
Rejoice!
Rejoice!
Rejoice!
