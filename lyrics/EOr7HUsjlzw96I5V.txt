Blur like a rocket
Torch like a dying sun
Snap like a dragon
Dive like a pelican
Kingdoms of my kingdom come
Skip like a prophet
Spit like a poet's gun
But say how long can this go on?
Stumbling before you speak
Stunning and stunning and stunning the black
You turn turncoat
Inward to seek out all your hopes
It's your signals
That hurts me most
We're in the middle
We're in the middle, ghosts
We're in the middle
We're in the middle, ghosts
Rue like a tyrant
Make like a valentine
Tear like a siren
Sulk like a sunken mine
Kingdoms of my kingdom come
It's all but one, so
Row like a felon
Drown like a captain's son
But say how long can this go on?
We're in the middle
We're in the middle, ghosts
We're in the middle
We're in the middle, ghosts
Stumbling before you speak
Stunning and stunning with canons to lead
And tigers tight
You scan the field
Someone dies tonight, it's tragic
But at least it's not you
We're in the middle
We're in the middle, ghosts
We're in the middle
We're in the middle, ghosts
We're in the middle
We're in the middle, ghosts
We're in the middle
We're in the middle, ghosts
