I numb out all the time, all the time
I get, get scared of the true colors of the past
So I hide and deny
How long this has gone on
Putting anything to pieces
Then forgetting about it all
Still numb out all the time, all the time

You know that I wanna feel the rain when it hits me
Wanna see with a clear eye view
I numb out all the time, all the time

I'm sleeping in the day every day again
Too safe in my old ways
Looking for the right time to change
I can start over with so much to show for me
Pulling anyone to pieces
Then singing about it all
Still numb out all the time, all the time

You know that I wanna feel the rain when it hits me
Wanna see with a clear eye view
I numb out all the time, all the time
You know that I wanna feel the wave when it gets me
Wanna look into the beautiful blue
I numb out all the time, all the time

I'm still standing as the history fades
It shows I've been long before
I'm just looking at the mess that we make
