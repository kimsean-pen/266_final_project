Gain through terror
Maintained the growth of my empire
Pain caused by anger
Maintained the fall of their empires

Blinding, is, my crown
Fearless, is, my throne
Your land... I will make my own

"Hail, my master"
Shall be the words spoken in my honor
Curse of the conqueror
Besieges your soul as you surrender

Shadows of my hand
Darkness on your land
Forever and now
You shall kneel and bow to me... slavishly

Bitter is your defeat
Treasures at my feet
Your wealth... I behold, with greed

Gain through terror
Maintained the growth of my empire
Pain caused by anger
Maintained the fall of their empires

Shadows of my hand
Darkness on your land
Forever and now
You shall kneel and bow to me... slavishly
