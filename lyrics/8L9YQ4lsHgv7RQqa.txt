Oh, no-whoa, look into your eyes
People always talkin' bout
People always run their mouth
But when I hold you there's no doubt my love for you is true
Before my life was ups and downs
And happiness I used to chase around
That's why I'm glad you came 'cause now there's no substitute

And I don't care whatever may come our way
It's you and me forever and ever to be, 'cause

When I look at you I see me from my head to your toes every part of me
And everything you do I did too 'cause I'll always be a part of you
(Always be a part of you)
When I look at you I see me from my heart to your soul I'll always love you so
And everything I do you'll do too 'cause your every little part of me

I've seen how easy things can change
And people never stay the same
But baby ever since you came you made me feel secure
Yes I think you should know
That people gonna come and go
Be assured of this one thing I will still remain

And I don't care whatever may come our way
It's you and me forever and ever to be, 'cause

When I look at you I see me from my head to your toes every part of me
(When I, everything)
And everything you do I did too 'cause I'll always be a part of you
When I look at you I see me from my heart to your soul I'll always love you so
(Oh, oh, I love you so)
And everything I do you'll do too 'cause your every little part of me
(Every little part of me)

I know that there will come a day
When you have to go away
But you have no reason to fear I promise I'll be here
If someone ever breaks your heart
And you feel your world is torn apart
My love for you will bring you through hard times
I'll help you be strong

When I look at you I see me from my head to your toes every part of me
(Oh, I see me, head to your toes)
And everything you do I did too 'cause I'll always be a part of you
(Everything you do, part of you)
When I look at you I see me from my heart to your soul I'll always love you so
(Oh, yeah)
And everything I do you'll do too 'cause your every little part of me
(You'll do too, oh yeah)

When I look at you I see me from my head to your toes every part of me
(I see me)
And everything you do I did too 'cause I'll always be a part of you
(Everything you do, always be a part of me)
When I look at you I see me from my heart to your soul I'll always love you so
And everything I do you'll do too 'cause your every little part of me
(Oh yeah, every little part of me, yeah)

Every little part of me
(You're every little part of me)
You'll always be my baby
(You're every little part of me)
Yeah
(You're every little part of me)
Oh
(You're every little part of me)
