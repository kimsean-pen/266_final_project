Jump into the fire
Dive in head first into the flames
We're broken and tired
Forgiving it is not the way

Here we are
Killing ourselves to live
We just need one more hit
And we might just live forever

Oh, here we are
We're going down with this ship
And if this is our last trip
At least we'll go together
We might just live forever

Hang on to the morning
Watch the wall light up the sky
Cave without a warning
We will be dead before we say die

Here we are killing ourselves to live
We just need one more hit
And we might just live forever
Oh, here we are
We're going down with this ship
And if this is our last trip
At least we'll go together
We might just live forever

Breaking out of the cage and into the fire
Channel the rage, holding it tighter
And I'm not ashamed to give into desire
And I'm not afraid of the pain that I fight for

Out of the cage and into the fire
Channel the rage, holding it tighter
And I'm not ashamed to give into desire
And I'm not afraid of the pain that I fight for

Yeah
Oohoh
I will fight for you
Win or lose

Here we are
Killing ourselves to live
We just need one more hit
And we might just live forever
(We might just live forever)
Oh, here we are
We're going down with this ship
(Going down with this ship)
And if this is our last trip
At least we'll go together
(Oh, least we'll go together)
We might just live forever
