Living right under the crumbling empire
Death holds the world in chains, dragged in the dirt behind him.
Burning for change, earning nothing, learning to hate
Modern life is an itch that can't be scratched
Suffer oppression from the politics of fear
The generation of hopelessness is here
In a race to the worst, we are finishing first
This existence is bleak and all our futures are cursed.
