The day's done
She won't listen
She won't listen
My head's numb
And I can't hear her
Any clearer

Bill Clinton in my head
Little clearer through the roof
Bill Clinton in my head
Little clearer through the roof
Bill Clinton in my head
Little clearer through the roof
Bill Clinton in my head
Bill Clinton!

My alien
He's still missing
He's still missing
My plan's done
And I can't hear ya
Any clearer

Little clearer in my head
Bill Clinton through the roof
Little clearer in my head
Bill Clinton through the roof
Little clearer in my head
Bill Clinton through the roof
Bill Clinton

Wipe all the sweat from my eyes
And hide from the ocean!
Waves crash my flesh and skull;
But I still feel stupid... stupid... stupid...
Stupid!
Stupid!
Stupid!
Stupid!
