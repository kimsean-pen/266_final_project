When you're lost and you know it, love
When you fought and you're hollow
When you give and you gotta go
Take the long road
Three kids broke home,
Knocked down but not alone
You can give but it's not enough
Take it on one more night
Never in sight, one last fight
One more dagger inside
All my life I've been searching in the dark
Searching in the dark,
How long must I wait for you?
We're taking on your hero,
Taking on your hero
We're got one more night
One more dagger inside
Taking on your hero,
Taking on your hero
We gotta one more night,
How long will I stay to wait for you?
You pretend there's nothing wrong
Fake smiles and open arms
You can live but it's not a home
Take it on one more night!
Never in sight, one last fight,
One more dagger inside
All my life I've been searching in the dark
Searching in the dark,
How long must I wait for you here?
You're taking on your hero,
Taking on your hero
One more night
One more day
Taking on your hero,
Taking on your hero
We gotta one more night,
How long must I wait for you?
These darker days
Happened so fast that we lost the way
As long as you'd think to tell me call your name
I really don't think that I'm staying
'Cause I'll be breaking down the chain
Breaking down the chains
Breaking down 'cause honestly it was nothing you could hold
Because I'm taking on your hero
How long must I wait for you?
Taking on your hero,
Taking on your hero
How long must I wait for you?
Take it on your hero,
Take it on your hero
How long must I wait for you here?
