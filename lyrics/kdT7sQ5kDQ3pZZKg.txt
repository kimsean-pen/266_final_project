Strange
I barely know you,
But yet I feel deeply connected to you

Crave
I never had you,
But yet I feel so lonely without you

Beautiful Stranger

Safe
I barely know you,
But yet I feel secure when I'm with you

Strange
I don't even know you,
But yet I feel so strong and bold when I'm with you

Beautiful Stranger
My Beautiful stranger

I know it sounds a little strange
But it will never be the same
It's like being locked up in a cage
It will never be the same
Nothing's lost but I feel shamed
And there ain't no one here to blame
Well, do you even know my name
I was right there when you came
It will never be the same
