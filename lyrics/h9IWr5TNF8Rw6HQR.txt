I don't want to understand this horror
There's a weight in your eyes, I can't admit
Everybody ends up here in bottles
But the name tag's the last thing you wanted

As the world explodes we fall out of it
And we can't let go because this will not go away
There's a house built out in space

And I can't see that thief that lives inside of your head
But I can be some courage at the side of you bed
And I don't know what's happening and I can't pretend
But I can be your, be your

Someone help us understand who ordered
This disgusting arrangement, time and the end
I don't want to hear who walked on water
Because the hallways are empty, clock ticks

As the world implodes we fall into it
And we can't go home because this will not go away
There's a house built out in space

And I can't see that thief that lives inside of your head
But I can be some courage at the side of you bed
And I don't know what's happening and I can't pretend
It's a long, long get away, it's a long, long get away
Make it home again, make it home again
It's a long, long get away, it's a long, long get away

I can't see that thief that lives inside of your head
But I can be some courage at the side of you bed
And I don't know what's happening and I can't pretend
But I can be your, be your, I'm here
And I can be your, be your, I'm here
It's a long, long get away
