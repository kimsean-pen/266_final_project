Of all the white horses

In these times of evil spirits
Of material thugs and mischief
Fearing Saint Noni's wisdom
And his love for rainbow spirits
Jealous of their faithful heart-bond
And their dancing and their laughing
Made at last a league against them
To molest them and destroy them
Saint Noni wise and heart-strong
Often said to Rainbowarrior
"O my brother, do not leave me!
Lest the evel spirits harm you!"
Rainbowarrior of two spirits
Gentle hand and lion-hearted
He laughed and then he answered
Like a child he softly whispered:

We are Rainbowarriors
Evil come not near
Rainbow love awaits us
With hearts of love and tears

He's dead, our sweetest mother
Loving father and our teacher
He's gone forever
He has moved a little nearer
To the master of all laughter
To the master of all song
O my brother, O my brother
Crystal brother of two spirits
Then we gathered in a circle
Stood round the rainbow fire
Burning ember's hearts united
We remember mystical beauty
If you look hard you can find a
Rainbow trail it's deep inside ya
Fear not you're a Rainbowarrior
Golden light on everything gleaming

We are Rainbowarriors
Evil come not near
Rainbow love awaits us
With hearts of love and tears
