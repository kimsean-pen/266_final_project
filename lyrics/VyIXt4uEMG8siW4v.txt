Followed you down to the end of the world
To wait outside your window
In the heat of the rain I would call your name
But you just pass me by
If you put me up like a fly on the wall
You'll be to blame when the heavens fall

Give me a sign that you hear me call
But you just pass me by
The colours around me are fading away
And I'll be waiting, come what may
I'll find you (I'll find you),
Yes I'll find you (Yes I'll find you)

If I'm gonna be the man who walks the earth alone

I followed the stars and I sailed to the sea
With heaven in my fingers
Alone on a beach, on my own out of reach
But you just passed me by

I'd give you the world if you take my hand
But you left me alone in the sinking sand
Strike up the band for one last stand
But you just pass me by
Show me the rules of the games you play
I'll be waiting, come on lady
I'll find you (I'll find you),
Yes I'll find you (Yes I'll find you)
Find out and be the man who walks the earth

I'll find you (I'll find you),
Yes I'll find you (Yes I'll find you)
If I'm gonna be the man who walks the earth alone

Followed you now to the end of the world
To wait outside your window
The heat of the rain I will call your name
But you just pass me by
Wherever you are I'll be on your tail
Whatever you're hiding behind your veil
I'll find you (I'll find you),
Yes I'll find you (Yes I'll find you)
If I'm gonna be the man who walks the earth
I'll find you (I'll find you),
Yes I'll find you (Yes I'll find you)
If I'm gonna be the man who walks the earth alone
