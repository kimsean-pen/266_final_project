Walking slow down the freeway, Sarah says that it's not much further
Kiss the sunlight on her face, let's say goodbye to this old and broken
town

Where we fell in love
Dead end streets became a drug
Held our voices like a prison cell, but now we shout it from the rooftops

Oh, we are the kids that you never loved
We are the ones that will never grow up
We're just some kids from the West End, oh oh oh
We are the voices you never heard
We are the fire you never let burn
We're just some kids from the West End, oh oh oh

Say goodbye to your old friends, kicking down all the rusty fences
Don't need much where we're going, just a little bit of love to get us by
Goodbye, we're on our way
You and I, we got it made
Throw your gold into a wishing well
And we'll be shouting from the rooftops

Oh, we are the kids that you never loved
We are the ones that will never grow up
We're just some kids from the West End, oh oh oh
We are the voices you never heard
We are the fire you never let burn
We're just some kids from the West End, oh oh oh

We are the kids, we are the kids, oh
We are the kids, we are the kids, oh
We are the kids, we are the kids, oh
And we'll be shouting from the rooftops- oh!

We are the kids that you never loved
We are the ones that will never grow up
We're just some kids from the West End, oh oh oh
We are the voices you never heard
We are the fire you never let burn
We're just some kids from the West End, oh oh oh

We are the kids, we are the kids, oh
We are the kids, we are the kids, oh
We are the kids, we are the kids, oh
And we'll be shouting from the rooftops

We are the voices you never heard
We are the fire you never let burn
We're just some kids from the West End, oh oh oh
