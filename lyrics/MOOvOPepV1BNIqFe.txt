Woman of a certain age
made to feel like they've gotta change.
Some of them change their faces,
but they don't smile the same.
Some of them take like horses,
some of them get divorces.
As the world gets strange,
it's time for a change.

Go on let your men get strange mama.
Go on let the world get strange.
Never change.

Women of the world unite.
It's all the boys, they just wanna fight.
And women of the world are born
to the boys little wars.
Mother, sister, daughter.
The boys are just killing father.
It's time to take the reigns,
and lead us away from the strange.
Go on and let your men get strange, mama.
Go on let the world get strange,
but never change.
Never change.
Never change.
