Take me back where I was your only friend
Well I was patiently waiting on your response
You're perfectly out of place

You say if I can't love myself
Then how the hell can I try to love you?
Did you forget how it first felt
Or did you feel nothing when I held on to you?

You're perfectly out of place
You're perfectly out of place

It made me wanna hurt myself
But I would never do that to you
And I still thought it through
Sleep tonight and think this through
You are the only one that I care about

And you're so beautiful
I wish I could reach out and touch you
Soft skin, your lips
I could die, could die and never cry again

And I'll just say it outright
I won't try to be poetic or silly
I cut myself on the bathroom floor with scissors and I bled
I couldn't reconcile the pain I had so I made myself breathe a new way
And I tried to hide my scars
But when you saw the blood stains on my bed sheets
You said: What's wrong?
And held me
And I felt loved
And I felt loved for the first time in what seems like forever
And as you grasped me tight I felt like I was in the arms of God
And there I wailed
And there I wailed

You're perfectly out of place
