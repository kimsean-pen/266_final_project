Never forgot the time You made me feel alive
When death was on my mind
Or when You held onto me
When the world let me fall behind

You were love to me
Rather than just a word
A friend was all You were
And it changed my heart

Stood next to me through the storm
Felt the wounds and kept me warm
Something I had never seen before
And I thank You
