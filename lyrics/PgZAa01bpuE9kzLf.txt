If I could only stand
And stare in the mirror
What could I see?
One fallen hero with a face
Like me

And if I scream would anybody hear me
If I smash the silence, you'll see what fame
Has done to me
Kiss away the pain and leave me lonely
I'll never know if love's a lie, ooh
Being crazy in paradise is easy
Do you see the prisoners in my eyes?
Where is the love to shelter me?

Give me love, love, love come set me free
Where is the love to shelter me?
Only love, love, love, love set me free
Set me free
