Be here, yes it is
It's so good just to be alive, well, well, well
It's so good to be here, yes it is
It's so good just to be alive, well, well, well
It's so good to be here

Natural disasters, all these emotional rappers
Master of my own fate and I own my own masters
Don't let this smooth taste fool you, when I bust, I school you
They throw rocks and hide behind the computer
It's yellow tape and white chalk when I'm on the beat
Yeah, you rich, but your talk is cheap
Never see me tryna walk a sheep
I'm so famous, can't even cough in peace
Your alter ego is Maltese
I was waitin' for Auntie Punken release
You niggas cryin' over spilled milk
Probably never seen your friend killed
Probably never seen your dad die
Or played dodgeball with fed time
I done some things I ain't proud of
Like sold my mom drugs
The devil put some toxin in me
Demons tryna have an auction in me
They wanna sell my soul
Goin' once, goin' twice, never sold
Best story that was never told
Keep in mind that I have several episodes
A lot of things to be thankful for
A wife and three kids, I may make it four

Never get the credit I deserve
I don't know if you hearin' every word
I don't get the credit I deserve
Rest in peace Johnny, really had them birds
Yeah, I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat
Yeah, I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat
You know I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat
Yeah, I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat

They wanna know where the jumpshot come from
Coach Outlaw taught me the BEEF method (Rest in peace)
Balance, eye contact, elbow room, follow through
See, that's what I was taught to do
I probably learned more from Coach Gwynn
Than I did from my own kin
Yeah, the streets was my sensei
I sold dope then rapped about it on my mixtape
I had respect but I gained more
You rather be underrated or unemployed?
Hmm, think on it
Keisha ring big enough to skate on it
My lifestyle big enough to hate on
This beat hard enough to put Jay on
My yard too big to put a rake on it
But I got the Cullinan and the Wraith on it

Never get the credit I deserve
I don't know if you hearin' every word
I don't get the credit I deserve
Rest in peace Johnny, really had them birds
Yeah, I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat
Yeah, I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat
You know I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat
Yeah, I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat

It's so good to be here,
Yes it is
It's so good just to be alive,
Well, well, well
It's so good to be here,
Yes it is
It's so good just to be alive,
Well, well, well
It's so good to be here,
Yes it is
It's so good just to be alive,
Well, well, well
He could have taken my life
