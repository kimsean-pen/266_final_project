You could read a million pages, know the words and all the phrases.
You could try to turn a lie into the truth.
And you can live to be a hundred, memorizin' every number.
You could even put a man on the moon.
And the science of the heart is sometimes lost on me.
But I'm following this feeling!
I don't know why, it's so hard to swallow our pride!
And I don't know how many wrongs make a right.
I don't know the reason.
Sometimes it just feels so good to cry!
And I don't know which way the wind will blow.
But you're here with me.
And that's all I need to know!
There's a moment in the morning, when I feel the most alone
But then I hear your voice, whispering my name.
It's like a wave of understanding and I never could have planned it
When the questions, and doubts all fade away.
And I don't know why, it's so hard to swallow our pride!
And I don't know how many wrongs make a right.
I don't know the reason.
Sometimes it just feels so good to cry!
And I don't know which way the wind will blow.
But you're here with me.
And that's all I need to know!
That's all I need to know
I figured it out, you turned me around at the speed of light.
All that I ever needed to know was in your eyes.
I don't know why, it's so hard to swallow our pride.
And I never count all the stars in the sky.
I don't know the reason.
Sometimes it just feels so good to cry!
And I don't know which way the wind will blow.
But you're here with me.
And that's all I need to know!
That's all I need to know!
That's all I need to know.
All I need to know!
