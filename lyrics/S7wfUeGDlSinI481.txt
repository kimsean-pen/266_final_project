Sick in the hot, hot bathroom
Glasses steamed, I couldn't see
And wasn't it a lovely time?
Didn't we have such a time?

Home in the cold cold morning
Roommate's sick, I'm disturbing his sleep
And wasn't it a lovely time?
Didn't we have such a time?

wasn't I the life and soul?

what drugs can I take to make me enjoy this?

I wish I was drunk
I wish I weren't here
I need to be more drunk
Or be less here

And when the cops came
Hiding in the back of the closet
And these people would not stop laughing
They could not shut their mouths

You wouldn't think having a good time would be so goddamn hard
You wouldn't think having a good time would be so goddamn hard
You overthink, you don't have a good time, you just wait for it to end
You don't think you'll ever try something as meaningless as this ever again
