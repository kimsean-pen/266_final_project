I was wrong
I struggle to sleep, put me on my knees
Good lord, I beg you
You gave me strength to stand
But then you took it away, I don't deserve this
You don't know what it's like to breathe
In a world that believes a void is clarity

So tell me, conscience can't you help me?
I put my faith in you
Because I can't make myself believe
And now I feel so abused
'Cause through it all, nobody could save me
I'm hoping I can get out of here someday
I know this soil too well, this pain is what I need
Dear conscience, pull me underneath
Pull me underneath

Confined 'cause I can't clean up

And I can't feel anything
I'm too fucked up
And God, you taught me every word is left unsaid
When you're talking to the dead
And I'm still talking to myself

Conscience can't you help me?
I put my faith in you
Because I can't make myself believe
And now I feel so abused
'Cause through it all, nobody could save me
I'm hoping I can get out of here someday
I know this soil too well, this pain is what I need
Dear conscience, pull me underneath

I'll sell my guns, sell my heart and put my blades on the table
Clean it up 'cause I'm not stable
And do I fight fair, or do I fight myself?
I swear, I'm just a half-empty heart
Given no chance to restart
I may never be good enough for myself
I'd better, I'd better
Clean up, clean up

I didn't think I'd stay
I didn't know I'd ever think this way
But these days are overwhelming
I'd turn away the pain
But it's standing right in front of me
I shouldn't have to hurt myself
Just to feel something
Just to feel something

So tell me, conscience can't you help me?
I put my faith in you
Because I can't make myself believe
And now I feel so abused
'Cause through it all, nobody could save me
I'm hoping I can get out of here someday
I know this soil too well, this pain is what I need
Dear conscience, pull me underneath
