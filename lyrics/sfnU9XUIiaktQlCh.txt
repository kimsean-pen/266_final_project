When I need to spark a bit
Of inspiration
And the melody
Feels like it's trapped inside

All I need is a little bit
Of illumination
So the rhythm can
No longer run and hide

When I take a puff
From the leaves of the devil
And it carries me
On to the other side

Fire it up
I like to fire it up
And it feels so right

Fire it up
'Cause when I fire it up
I feel like serenity
(Oh, I feel like serenity)
Is mine

When I need a little bit of relaxation
My medicine isn't too hard to find

When I'm looking for
A bit of rejuvenation
I only partake of the finest kind

And then the mystery
Begins to unravel
And it helps me break
Through to the other side

Fire it up
I like to fire it up
And it feels so right

Fire it up
'Cause when I fire it up
I feel like serenity
(Oh, I feel like serenity)
Is mine

Fire it up!
Fire it up!

Fire it up
Fire it up
I like to fire it up
And it feels so right
Fire it up
'Cause when I fire it up
I feel like serenity
(Oh, I feel like serenity)
Is mine!
