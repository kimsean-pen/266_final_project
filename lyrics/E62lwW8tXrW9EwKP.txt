I-I-I-I'll take you there
Where the sunset's over the sea
Our place where no one gets
One day gonna see
Now I can't feel my feet
I'm way too deep
Holding on for an hour
I'd be faded in, faded in, faded in
Tell me what went feeling is all true
Waiting here to lose it
Spotlights and all weaks on my
Tell me you are losing it all, too
Waiting here, but now we're stuck in plain sight
We are shadows in the dark
So, I won't blame,
Start talking
Show me your spark
'Cause we are in PLAIN SIGHT.
Now I can't feel my feet
I'm way too deep
Holding on for an hour
I'd be faded in, faded in, faded in
Tell me what went feeling is all true
Waiting here to lose it
Spotlights and all weaks on my
Tell me you are losing it all, too
Waiting here, but now we're stuck in plain sight
I'll take you to do whatever you wanna do
So, you can come with me to feel what you never shake
I feel like they've taken us away
But I couldn't care less about
What they have to say!
Tell me what went feeling is all true
Waiting here to lose it
Spotlights and all weaks on my
Tell me you are losing it all, too
Waiting here, but now we're stuck in plain sight
Tell me what went feeling is all true
Waiting here to lose it
Spotlights and all weaks on my
Tell me you are losing it all, too
Waiting here, but now we're stuck in plain sight
