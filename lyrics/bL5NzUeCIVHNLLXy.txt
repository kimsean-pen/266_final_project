I can tell by your eyes
That you've probably been crying forever
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothing
To you, they're a mirror

I don't wanna talk about it
How you've broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay, won't you listen
To my heart?
Oh, my heart

If I stand all alone
Will the shadows hide the colors of my heart?
Blue for the tears, black for the night's fears
The stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you
They're a mirror

I don't wanna talk about it
How you've broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen
To my heart?
Oh, my heart

My poor heart

Oh, my heart

I don't wanna talk about it
How you've broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen
To my heart?
