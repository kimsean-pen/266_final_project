See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long

And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline
See these eyes so red

Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near

Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me

Ya wouldn't believe what I've been through
You've been so long
Well it's been so long
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline

See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
Tears that never dry

A judgement made can never bend
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me

Ya wouldn't believe what I've been through
You've been so long
Well it's been so long
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline

Putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out fire
I've been putting out fire
Well, it's been so long (so long, so long)

Yes, it's been so long (so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire (been so long, so long, so long)
Been Putting out fire (Been so long, so long, so long)
Yeah, putting out fire (Been so long, so long, so long)
Putting out fire (Been so long, so long, so long)
Yeah, putting out fire (Been so long, so long, so long)
Putting out fire (Been so long, so long, so long)
Been so long (been so long, so long, so long)
Been so long (been so long, so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire
(Been so long so long so long)
I've been putting out fire
