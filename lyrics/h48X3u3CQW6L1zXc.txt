You say my name
I pull away
I can't help it, I can't take on all your pain
There's a guilt in this
I taste in every kiss
I don't know, I'm just a little selfish

You need me, I don't need you
Just admit it
Admit it
Oh, I'm too broken to fix you too
I admit it
I admit it
(Oh)

Ha, ha, please don't lean on me
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth
(Oh)
Ha, ha, think I gotta leave
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth
(Oh)
I can't take the pressure of it, I can barely breathe
(Oh)
Ha, ha, please don't lean on me
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth, no

In a perfect world
I'm the perfect girl
So together, always there to solve your problems
But underneath
It's bittersweet
The more I give, the more I'm feeling incomplete

You need me, I don't need you
Just admit it
Admit it
Oh, I'm too broken to fix you too
I admit it
I admit it
(Oh)

Ha, ha, please don't lean on me
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth
(Oh)
Ha, ha, think I better leave
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth
(Oh)
I can't take the pressure of it, I can barely breathe
(Oh)
Ha, ha, please don't lean on me
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth

I-I-I bite my tongue
'Cause I don't know how to tell you
I'm getting this urge to run
And I-I-I bite my tongue
'Cause I don't know how to tell you
That you deserve someone else, who can treat you like I want to

Ohhh
Ah, please don't lean on me
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth
(Oh)
Ha, ha, think I better leave
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth
(Oh)
I can't take the pressure of it, I can barely breathe
(Oh)
Ha, ha, please don't lean on me
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth, no
