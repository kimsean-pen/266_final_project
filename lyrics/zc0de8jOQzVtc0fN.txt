In the beginning I believed in love and things
It happened like a hurricane
I could never really tell you what this did to me
I could never make it better for you
Anyway

Thing is
Time was
Part of me used to love you
Part of me still does
This light here
Some become strangers

Did it have to be so easy to live without it
I was hoping to remember you with just a smile
Now the memory of giving you is giving out
Well, I could say that I knew it all the while

Thing is
Time was
Part of me used to love you
Part of me still does
This light here
Some become strangers

Didn't want to be the one to
Say goodbye
In a stranger's eyes
Look how we've changed

I don't really need this in my life
Why don't we forget about it

Thing is
Time was
Part of me used to love you
Part of me still does
This light here
Some become strangers
Let your soul become a stranger

Baby, you're no stranger
You're no stranger
Not that I am
Well, you've become that stranger
And let your soul become a stranger
Well, you're no stranger not that I am
So you do it I think that you should do it
Well you do it
