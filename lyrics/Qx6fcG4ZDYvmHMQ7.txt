Don't tell me I've been dreaming
When you're standing there in front of me
It's just the simple things, you see
It's all the things you do to me

When everything is crazy
You find a way to make it right
Yes, I love and I love and I love and I want you
It's gonna be 'til the end of time

You only have to look my way
For me to know it's not in vain
And even when it's raining
I don't see the clouds again

When everything is changing
When I'm tripping up against the tide
Yes, I love and I love and I love and I want you
It's gonna be 'til the end of time
I wanna be right by your side
I'm gonna love you day and night
It's only you that makes it right, ooh

When everything is crazy
You find a way to make it right
Yes, I love and I love and I love and I want you
It's gonna be till the end of time
Gonna love you day and night
It's only you that makes it right, ooh
