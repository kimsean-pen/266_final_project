Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze!

Squeeze my arms a little tighter
Let me know I'm still alive
Cause you're the only one here keeping both my eyes open tonight
And I know that we got problems
Who are they to criticize
If I tell you all my secrets would you tell me all your lies
And when I stop writing her letters
I want her to know that it's because
I have someone that makes me feel the same exact way that she does
And I will not deny the privilege to someone else who wants my love
I have stitched a mask of confidence and I wear it like a glove
And a man that knows what he's talking, spoke to me today
He said that no ones going to listen until you mean every word you say
So if you can't find the feeling, you better learn to lie
And if you know we're gonna fail, then there's no point to even try
No point to try, no point try, no point to try

I don't get it for real, this is blowing my mind
We keep saying we're unhappy and they keep saying that we're fine
I guess pain will be the only thing I ever get to bring
But I will send it through the air like a loosely gripped baseball bat swing
All I ever wanted was something different, maybe by another name
We could set ourselves on fire, there is cleansing in the flame

So keep clapping and dancing
Let them know you're still alive and if you're tired of giving up
At least make them think that you surived
So keep laughing, its not funny but at least you don't have to cry
When you wake up in the morning and you know you're still alive
You're still alive, you know you're still alive
You're still alive, you know you're still alive

Until we break down, til we shut down
Until the weight of our lifeless bodies hit the ground
Until we break down, til we shut down
Until the weight of our lifeless bodies hit the ground
Until we break down, til we shut down
Until the weight of our lifeless bodies hit the ground

And a man that knows what he's talking, spoke to me today
He said that no ones going to listen until you mean every word you say
So if you can't find the feeling, you better learn to lie
And if you know we're gonna fail, then there's little point to even try
Little point to try
