Turn away technology
How about an apology?
You got a lot to say
But not to my face
Everybody thinks they know
How every little thing should go
But I'm just a stranger, stuck in a strange place

Cause I love, and I cry
And I feel, all the time

I don't wanna ever grow up
I don't wanna ever grow up
I don't wanna ever grow up
I don't wanna ever grow up

Anger makes the world go 'round
That's the way it is right now
Life's still a mystery
Don't spoil it for me

Cause I love, and I cry
And I feel, all the time

I don't wanna ever grow up
I don't wanna ever grow up
I don't wanna ever grow up
I don't wanna ever grow up

Let them fight it out
They don't know nothing about me-e-e
Cause love is everywhere
If you even care to see-e-e
They can say I'm wrong
They don't know I'm strong
All tis world is cold
So even when I'm old

I don't wanna ever grow up
I don't wanna ever grow up
I don't wanna ever grow up
I don't wanna ever grow up
I don't wanna ever grow up
I don't wanna ever grow up
I don't wanna ever grow up
I don't wanna ever grow up
