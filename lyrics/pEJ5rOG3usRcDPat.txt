You tried to taste me
I taped my tongue to the southern tip of your body
Our bones are too heavy to come up
Squished into a single cell of wood

And I made an excuse
And you found another way to tell the truth
I put no one else us above us
We'll still be best friends when all turns to dust

We are so smooth now
Our edges are beaten driftwood whittled down
Old bodies slip when they make love
We'll mine our sparks to shoot above us
