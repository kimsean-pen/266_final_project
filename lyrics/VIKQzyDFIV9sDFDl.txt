Well it's happening again, like I always thought it would

Madmen dancing in the street and fires rage
And it's a strange infatuation taking off across the nations
Crazy dialling confrontation 'cause it's one more move and it's all over

Gimme some lovin', it's what I need
Gimme little lovin', makes me feel right
Gimme some lovin' that's the way
Gimme little lovin' makes me say

It's spreading everywhere, showing here and growing there
There's no time for condemnation, just to wait
And it's an eerie indication of things that's turning out to be
Destruction to distraction
'Cause it's one more move and it's goodbye
You know why we've got to say, just

Gimme some lovin' it's what I need
Gimme little lovin' makes me feel right
Gimme some lovin' that's the way
Gimme litlle lovin' makes me feel like

They fall, again, on the streets tonight

And we're wakin' up every day, looking this way looking that way
Wondering who will come and end this game
Of one more move and it's all over

Gimme some lovin' it's what I need
Gimme little lovin' makes me feel right
Gimme some lovin' that's the way
Gimme some lovin' that's the way

Gimme some lovin' (makes me feel right)
Gimme some lovin' (makes me feel right)
Gimme some lovin' (yeah, you got it)
Gimme some lovin' (makes me feel right)...
