Crystal core
Your mind has been divided from your soul
Now you say you are that stranger on your shore

Grief it, brings the need, the naked freeze
Caught in the frost
Numb, unbearable thoughts, your inner need
Fire not lost, no way, not lost

I've just come from the Reindeer King
He says: Your purity of soul, crystalline
Gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you
You gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you
You, you, you, you, you

Crystal core
You are at the still point of the turning world
The divide
Fearing death, desiring life

Ice, you were the one most tender with the rivers
You, the roof of the waves, layer after layer
After layer

I've just come from the Reindeer King
He says: Your purity of soul, crystalline
Gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you
You gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you

Know that I would skate
Skate all the way
Just to hold your hand
To take away your pain
You know that I would skate
From Scandinavia, ooh
All the way
To the moons of Jupiter
With you
You, you, you, you

Gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you
You gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you
You gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you
You gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you

I've just come from the Reindeer King
