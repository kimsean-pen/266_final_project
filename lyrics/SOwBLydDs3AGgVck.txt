Girl, you've been gone away a real long time
Now I really went out of my mind, went now
Ah, I miss your lovin' when you left me, baby you did

Ah baby, come here
Let me caress you
Ah, ah baby let us, ah, tell me what you missed
Come here, sugar, and get to this

Ah baby, I want you here
I want to do something freaky to you
I want to feel what I've felt long
Ah come baby and get to this

Ooh remember, baby
How you made me feel just like a king
Ah, I've been waiting
I'm ready for you to start doing the things

So I'll know you're mine
You're so fine, so petite, oh candy sweet
Ah, I've been waiting
Come here, come here, baby, get to this

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sweet love, sweet love, oh so good
Get back, ooh, everything else will have to get back
Oh, nothin's changed, you're still sweet as the mornin' rain
Girl, I'm standin' ready to
Love you, babe, make it good to you

Oh, I need your love
Don't make me wait, I can't wait
Oh, I'm so impatient for your love
Come here, sweet sweet baby, get to this

Girl, I know you've been gone a long time
You nearly blew my mind, baby
Girl, you've been gone for so long
I'm so glad, glad that you call me your baby
