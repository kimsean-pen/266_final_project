You wanna disappear in a crowd
Just a stranger in a room
Wanna change your colours just for the night.
With no word of it following you home
No word of it following you home
No word of it following you home
No word of it.

Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger in a room
ooh, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger in a room

Tonight I fell for the outline
Of someone I've wanted to know
Cos here, under the blue lights
There's always someone I've wanted to know
With no way of it working back home
No way of it working back home
No way of it working back home
No way of it

And I don't wanna waste my time
On an unfamiliar eye
Been looking in from the outside
I come in

Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger in a room
ooh, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger in a room
