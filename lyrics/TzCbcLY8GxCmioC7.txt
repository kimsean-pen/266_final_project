Your Empty walls
Your Empty walls
Pretentious attention
Dismissive apprehension
Don't waste your time
On coffins today
When we decline
From the confines of our mind
Don't waste your time
On coffins today...

Don't you see their bodies burning?
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication
Don't you see their bodies burning?
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication
I want you to be left behind those empty walls

Taunt you to see from behind those empty walls...

Those empty walls
When we decline
From the confines of our mind

Don't waste your time
On coffins today...

Don't you see their bodies burning?
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication
Don't you see their bodies burning?
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication
I want you to be left behind those empty walls
Taunt you to see from behind those empty walls
Want you to be left behind those empty walls
I taunt you to see from behind those empty walls
From behind those empty walls

From behind those empty walls
The walls!
From behind those empty walls...

I loved you yesterday
(From behind those empty walls...)
Before you killed my family
(From behind those empty walls, the walls...)

Don't you see their bodies burning?
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication
Don't you see their bodies burning
Desolate and full of yearning
(I want you...)
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication
(To be left behind those empty...)
I want you to be left behind those empty walls

Taunt you to see from behind those empty walls
(Desolate and full of yearning, Dying of anticipation, Choking from intoxication...)
Want you to be left behind those empty walls
(Don't you see their bodies burning? Desolate and full of yearning, Dying of anticipation, Choking from intoxication...)
I taunt you to see from behind those empty walls
(Trust your empty walls, trust your empty walls)
From behind those empty walls
(Trust your empty walls, trust your empty walls)
From behind those fucking walls
(Trust your empty walls, trust your empty walls)
From behind those goddamn walls
Those walls!
Those walls!
