Tell me, come on, tell me what you can.
Even as you wait for death, you're wiser than I am.
Tell me, what does it mean to exist?
I am not a scientist - I must believe in more than this.
I cannot accept that everything that's real
Is only what our eyes can see and our hands can feel.

Not even Earth can hold us.
Not even life controls us.
Not even the ground can keep us down.
The memories in my head
Are just as real as the time we spent.
You'll always be close to me, my friend.
This is not the end.

I see, I can see you're so afraid.
Wear it like a silver hood - on you, even fear looks good.
I wish, I wish I had some words to give.
But all that I can think to say is I'll be with you everyday.

Not even Earth can hold us.
Not even life controls us.
Not even the ground can keep us down.
The memories in my head
Are just as real as the time we spent.
You'll always be close to me, my friend.
This is not the end.

La la la la la la la la la la la
This is not the end.
La la la la la la la la la la la
This is not the end.
La la la la la la la la la la la
This is not the end.
La la la la la la la la la la la

I don't care, I don't care what you believe.
As long as you are in my heart, you're just as real as me.
Maybe, maybe even more.
Someone who's touched so many lives could never ever die.

Not even Earth can hold us.
Not even life controls us.
Not even the ground can keep us down.
The memories in my head
Are just as real as the time we spent.
You'll always be close to me, my friend.
This is not the end.

La la la la la la la la la la la
This is not the end.
La la la la la la la la la la la
This is not the end.
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la
This is not the end.
