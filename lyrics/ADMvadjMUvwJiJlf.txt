Check, check
One, one

Born in the sunset
Brought here to love but weighed by the seed
All of this hope has changed
I'm sinking slow in chains
Fool taught to keep myself in chains
Words from the preacherman
Engraved in my head
Do I believe in faith?
It's so hard to feel your faith
It's so hard to feel your faith

Why don't you just preach?
Why don't you just preach?
Said why don't you just preach?
Hey, why don't you just preach?
Said why don't you just preach?
Hey, why don't you just preach?
Said why don't you just preach?
Hey, why don't you just preach?

Waiting to be saved
Hung by the tree in flames from your sun
And where were you in all this pain?
'Cause I feel it more than ever now
And where were you through all this rage?
And why should I believe?

Why don't you just
Preach
And why don't you just preach?
And why do you just preach?
And why don't you just preach?
And why don't you just preach?
And why don't you just preach?
And why do you just preach?
And why don't you just preach?
I said why do you just preach?
Yeah, why don't you just preach?
And why don't you just preach?

Preach
