It was 4 a.m., I couldn't sleep
So I did my hair and I fixed a drink
Sat on the porch with my guitar
Sang about how you broke my heart
Singing "la la la la la la"

I went and tore your pictures up
Built a fire in my bathtub
Painted my toes while I watched them burn
Then put out the flames with your t-shirt

If you think that sounds crazy, then you should've seen me
Sitting by the phone, all those nights alone
Believing lies you told me, thinking I'm your only
Putting off my friends to be with you again
Forgiving when you say "I love you, baby"
That's what I call crazy

If the neighbor looked through my windowpane
He'd say she's finally gone insane
All the things I do around this old house
Like cussing your name, screaming out loud
My bedroom wall's got a hole in it now

If you think that sounds crazy, then you should've seen me
Sitting by the phone, all those nights alone
Believing lies you told me, thinking I'm your only
Putting off my friends to be with you again
Forgiving when you say "I love you, baby"
That's what I call crazy

I've been seeing red since you said goodbye
I might break a thing or two sometimes

If you think that sounds crazy, then you should've seen me
Sitting by the phone, all those nights alone
Believing lies you told me, thinking I'm your only
Putting off my friends to be with you again
Forgiving when you say "I love you, baby"
That's what I call crazy

That's what I call crazy, yeah
That's what I call crazy, oh
That's what I call crazy.
