Your mama likes me and she doesn't like anyone
Your dumb, drunk friends don't care for me and always told you so

I wished you didn't tell me I was special
'Cause now it's far too hard to see through
'Cause you shine brighter than morning
At least I thought you did

I really thought you were my four-leaf clover
I know I'm lonely but I won't come over
I really thought you were my four-leaf clover
I really thought that I was lucky
I really thought you were my four-leaf clover
I know I'm lonely but I won't come over
I really thought you were my four-leaf clover
I really thought that I was lucky, fuck me

Am I pathetic from this year-long deficit
You don't like drama so why you wanna live on top of it
I'm sorry I don't hack your phone like he did
And when you need space to breathe, I leave it
But who needs space from across the country
I'm accustomed to feel like nothing, fuck me

I wished you didn't tell me I was special
'Cause now it's far too hard to see through
'Cause you shine brighter than morning
At least I thought you did

I really thought you were my four-leaf clover
I know I'm lonely but I won't come over
I really thought you were my four-leaf clover
I really thought that I was lucky
I really thought you were my four-leaf clover
I know I'm lonely but I won't come over
I really thought you were my four-leaf clover
I really thought that I was lucky, fuck me

This line's here to make you think of Burbank
And all of those firsts that we lived in LA
I chased you down the stairs every day
This line's here to say fuck the 100
Out of state plates made me think of something
This line's here to make you think you know [?]
The one I always loved but you were so self-conscious
I'm haunted

Your mama likes me and she doesn't like anyone
Your dumb, drunk friends don't care for me and always told you so

I really thought you were my four-leaf clover
I know I'm lonely but I won't come over
I really thought you were my four-leaf clover
I really thought that I was lucky
I really thought you were my four-leaf clover
I know I'm lonely but I won't come over
I really thought you were my four-leaf clover
I really thought that I was lucky, fuck me

'Cause you shine brighter than morning
At least I thought you did
I chased you down the stairs every day
