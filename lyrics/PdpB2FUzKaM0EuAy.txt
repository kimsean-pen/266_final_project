Sophisticated mood swings,
manipulated day dreams.

We've got champagne taste,
but not enough money for the real thing.
We've got flames in our veins and just enough money for the weekend.

Last night I did things my mother told me not to with the people I shouldn't see,
in the places that I should not go and it felt just like, it felt just like,
it felt just like, it felt just like, it felt just like, felt just like love and drugs.

Debilitated feelings sprawled across the bed
She's spinning perfect blue buildings
while I'm counting crows inside my head.

We've got champagne taste but not enough money for the real thing.
We've got flames in our veins and just enough money for the weekend.

Last night I did things my mother told me not to with the people I shouldn't see,
in the places that I should not go and it felt just like, it felt just like,
it felt just like, it felt just like, it felt just like, felt just like love and drugs.

Let the waves of strange fall down.
Let them crash and drift around.

Last night I did things my mother told me not to with the people I shouldn't see,
in the places that I should not go and it felt just like, it felt just like,
it felt just like, it felt just like, it felt just like, felt just like love and drugs.
