I'm (I'm) so (so) hypnotised
Open the days
Mesmerised
I'm trying to visualise

You right now
Keep me cool right now
I like to be OptimistiC
You and me âž¡ that's futuristic
We can fly high like a spaceship,
Zoom right now
To the moon right now
You want me all alone
Yeah, I heard that before
But first I got to know
Got to know if you insecure

Can you take contro-o-ol?
Tell me baby
Can you break my lips?
Boy, I got to know
I wanna know if you're built for this
Built for this
Built for this
I-I-I wanna know if you're built for this

I-I-I wanna know if you're built for this
Too fly for you, have to go
So cold like a popsicle
Row deep when we at the show
Guest list, Becky G plus Mexico
You don't know what you do to me
Got me acting all stupidly!
If I'm allowed to speak truthfully
In a world full of lies?
You're the truth to me
You want me all alone

Yeah, I heard that before
But first I got to know

Got to know if you insecure
Can you take contro-o-ol?
Tell me baby
Can you break my lips?
Boy, I got to know
I wanna know if you're built for this
Built for this
Built for this
I-I-I wanna know if you're built for this
I-I-I wanna know if you're built for this
Built for this
Built for this
Built for this...
I-I-I wanna know if you're built for this
i-i-i-i-i...
I-I-I wanna know if you're built for this

You want me all alone
But first I got to know
Can you take contro-o-ol?
Boy, I got to know
I wanna know if you're built for this
I wanna know if you're built for this
I wanna know if you're built for this
