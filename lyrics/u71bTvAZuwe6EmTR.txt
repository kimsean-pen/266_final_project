Some sort of assembly took us through time / Awakened my mind
I was as clockwork-you were alive to prevent my eyes from surprise
When we wish for the same things many see signs - some others find
When we're together we come alive when we organise

Collective arrival
We share the same space
We feel the same impact on arrival and embrace

Some joining connection larger than life carried our minds
You were in contact - I was alive when your eyes united with mine
When we rise through the stages many still minds grow as we find
We are connected weaving our lives - now we're boundless

We share the same space
We share the same space
We share the embrace
