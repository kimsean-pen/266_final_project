Had the package
I was waiting at the station
I caught her in
The corner of my eye
She was heading for
A secret destination
I never had the chance
To ask her why

And this cold war is
Just raging on and on
In a second we
Could all be gone

Lost my love
Somewhere in the city
Drops of blood
With a stranger's DNA, yeah
Lost my love
Two boys who raise the pity
Had enough
Of internal affairs

She was trouble
So they sent her on a mission
They wanted her to
Infiltrate my heart
She succeeded
Guess she made the wrong decision
The plans they made were doomed right from the start

And this cold war is
Just raging on and on
In a second we
Could all be gone

Lost my love
Somewhere in the city
Drops of blood
With a stranger's DNA
Lost my love
Two boys who raise the pity
Had enough
Of internal affairs

-Solo-

Lost my love
Somewhere in the city
Drops of blood
With a stranger's DNA, yeah
Lost my love
