I couldn't sleep last night cause I tried to forget you
In the suffocated air I resolved to let you go
Twisted all our dreams til you became the nightmare
Close it off inside or else the hurt is gonna rise

I couldn't sleep last night cause I tried to forget you
Heard the old man and the sea sing a note
And the silver felt she cried, never forget had gone and died
And their babes have clumb to her had all let go

I wish she touched my skin
An old gentle skin
Said as a warning
I wish she touched my skin
Where once we kissed a man
That man was forced demand
I have to tell you dear
Death has me on my breezes
My dear, she touched my skin
And all she did she touched my skin
Where once we kissed a man
That man was forced demand

Still I'm holding out my hand
Started my heart on demand
He's the ghost that haunt me too
And it's me and you, all about us

Still I'm holding out my hand
Started my heart on demand
He's the ghost that haunt me too
And it's me and you, all about us
