I, chase, blind, faith
To brand new obsession
She's a coping device
For another addiction
That I can romanticize, oh oh

But it's a wonderful feeling
And I built it this way
So I can cherish the heartache
When all of the DJs and Porsches steal her away

D-D-DJs
D-D-D
D-D-DJs
D-D-D

I need another exemption before I can rise
Can try a bit of passion but soon it'll die
There is no time for appreciating
Oh, it's killing my flow
Fly away to your castle
The science of letting go, oh oh (oh oh, oh oh)

Steal her away

But it's a wonderful feeling
And I built it this way
So I can cherish the heartache
When all of the DJs and Porsches steal her away

D-D-DJs

D-D-DJs (chase)
D-D-D (blind)
D-D-DJs (faith)

D-D-DJs

D-D-DJs

(Steal her away)

But it's a wonderful feeling
And I built it this way
So I can cherish the heartache
When all of the DJs and Porsches steal her away
Steal her away
