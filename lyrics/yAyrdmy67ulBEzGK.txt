I want it, I got it. It's like I just can't get enough
I see it, I need it. More of whatever keeps me numb
I feel it consuming but I'll ignore that till I die
I want what they have and I won't stop until it's mine

I fear myself becoming calloused and unable to feel
Greed takes over!
I lose control and question what is real
I want more than I need, the American dream
Take and take until I have everything
Now I'm covered in greed and the reflection I see doesn't look like the man I want to be

I spent my life chasing after things that I fought for and now I'm torn
Because none of it has ever satisfied my soul
It just leaves me wanting more

I know that it's wrong but it feels so right
I can't deny!
I'm losing this war with my self-indulgent life

What if I gave it all away, and shed the layers of the selfishness I hate?
I want to be free but I'm so afraid that I am too far gone and I'm stuck with all the choices I have made

There has to be more to life because I got it all, and never got it right
There's got to be more than this
Tell me there is something that I missed

I spent my life chasing after things that I fought for and now I'm torn, because none of it has ever satisfied my soul
It just leaves me wanting more
I gave myself to things I thought I loved but they never gave me enough
Now I'm right back where I started from
I'm so sick of wanting more
I'm so sick of wanting more!

Want and want and want until we want to die because we never find what we're looking for
What are we looking for?
Consume, consume, consume until it consumes us
Want and want and want
When will it stop?

I spent my life chasing after things that I fought for and now I'm torn, because none of it has ever satisfied my soul
It just leaves me wanting more
I gave myself to things I thought I loved but they never gave me enough
Now I'm right back where I started from
I'm so sick of wanting more
