I get back home at a quarter to four
What ya doin' with ya keys inside my door?
Seventeen and you've never been here before

I try my best not to put you down
But there's a hole in my head where the words fall out
I don't care what faithless people say
Should I care?

Seventeen
Don't change one thing

We take our chances every day
We watch those bleeding hearts decay
I'd walk through walls, would it make you stay?

I burnt my bridges and I burned my friends
If I had my time, I'd do it again
I don't care what faithless people say
I don't care

Seventeen
Don't change one thing
Just burn to the end
That's seventeen girl
Seventeen
Don't change one thing
Just burn to the end
That's seventeen girl

I don't wanna talk, I wanna go home
There's a voice in my head, won't leave me alone
I want you to follow me home

Coz I know this star that we transcend
Could be the only chance we get
Seventeen, I've never been here before

Seventeen
Don't change one thing
Just burn to the end
That's seventeen girl
Seventeen
Don't change one thing
Just burn to the end
That's seventeen girl
Burn to the end
