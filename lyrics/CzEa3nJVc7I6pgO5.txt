See,
Those days have gone by
So fast it died
Like it wasn't anything
But I'd do anything
To make it right
And I think all the time
About that night

I was saying
You meant something to me
You sailed away that day
Make your way to me

Cause I, I, I, will wait
I, I, I will wait
So sai-ai-ail to me
Sai-ai-ail to me

Say just where you'll go
I'm always waiting
I'm always waiting
I will wait for you to find your way
So you can sail back to me
So you can sail back to me

Now,
You drift in your days
To find your way
You've been gone so long
But I'd do anything
To be your tides
To move you along
to my lonely side

I am waiting
For you to come back to me
You let the wind guide your way
Left me nothing but sad

Cause I, I, I, will wait
I, I, I will wait
So sai-ai-ail to me
Sai-ai-ail to me

Say just where you'll go
I'm always waiting
I'm always waiting
I will wait for you to find your way
So you can sail back to me
So you can sail back to me
Say just where you will go to see
That you must sail back to me
So you can sail back to me
Let those waves flow the love we had
I will wait, cause I will wait
