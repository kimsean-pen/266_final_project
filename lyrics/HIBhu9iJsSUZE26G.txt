Every now and then I think about you
And it makes me, it breaks me
Out of you and into me, I'll make it

So take a look at what you do to my head
When you're leaving, I'm breathing
Out of me and into you, I feel sick, I feel sick

Now that you're leaving
It complicates our lives
But I am the reason
That I will stay alive

We are the energy
We are the same as you
Take everything you need

We are the answer to
The broken, breaking through
Take everything from me

Every now and then I dream about you
I've lost the feeling, it's dead skin
I will never be dependent again

And every now and then I think about you
It's bringing me closer to closure
Every now and then I know it's over, it's over

Now that you're leaving
It complicates our lives
But I am the reason
That I will stay alive

We are the energy
We are the same as you
Take everything you need

We are the answer to
The broken, breaking through
Take everything from me

We are the energy
We are the same as you
Take everything you need

We are the answer to
The broken, breaking through
Take everything from me

'Cause I'm not dying
No I'm not dying, today
