In a tiny little cave
A dog is sleeping on his back
Iron chains around his leg
But he's purring loud enough to snap
I see blood around his snout
A smile that's bigger than his mouth
They come to hurt him every day
To stomp him back into a crouch
They will never quite cut through
Cause he's got a little piece of you
The time gets longer every day
But he sits there smiling in his cave

They will never quite cut through
we've have a little piece of you

And all the spite you ever spate
betrays your monument to fate

Fall asleep and dream.

Salt in your skin
That leaves a small scar
It sits there in time
A red shiny star

Salt in your skin
That leaves a small scar
It sits there murdering time
A red shiny star

Shadow sweet in your bones
Helps to know what you said
The hand on your skin
Brings a war to your face

Fall asleep and dream now
Windows are made in your sighs
The piece you had hid to hide
The cave walls high in your mind

Fall asleep and dream now
Your heart is ready to die
Your jaws open wide
Windows are made in your mind
