My heart beats loud enough to deafen me
And you keep coming to me in my dreams
And lights flash
I beg that you'll appear in flesh
And tell me everything I want to hear
And the again

La la la la la la...

If the pain is endless
How can I live?
How can I live?
When the weight is relentless
To be with you now
Feels like the only way out

Maybe you can make it better
I don't need forever
Just find me somehow

And if you're unsure, cause we're been here before
I don't want more than for
You to talk me down
And love me just for now
Love me just for now

My mind plays with you like you're it's favourite game
And I shake, addicted to the drug I crave
And I'm trapped, carrying this burden on my back
But I won't let you fall
Even if my body cracks

La la la la la la
Even if my body cracks
La la la la la la la

I don't need my body
If the pain is endless
How can I live?
How can I live?
When the weight is relentless
To be with you now
Feels like the only way out

Maybe you can it better I don't need forever
Just find me somehow
And if you're unsure
'Cause we're been here before
I don't want more than for
You to talk me down
And love me just for now
Love me just for now

I can't erased what we had
So please understand
It's not how I want this to be
Yet, I'm chained to the past
And in sinking fast
It's not how I wanted you to see me
If the pain is endless
How can I life?
How can I live?
When the weight is relentless
To be with you now
Feels like the only way out

Maybe you can make it better
I don't need forever
Just find me somehow
And if you're unsure, cause we're been here before
I don't want more than for
You to talk me down
And love me just for now
Love me just for now
