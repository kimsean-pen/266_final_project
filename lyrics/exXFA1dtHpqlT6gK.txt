Child of autumn was born
To a world of deceit and death, the land of lies
Break her bonds would take her away
And install a sense of loss and eternal sorrow

She walks across the country
She holds her head up high in the rain
Mother was screaming for help
She turns around to stare
At a scene from her memory

She's sighing a wish in her heart
That flows through her blood always
it's come from a dream
That someone is waiting to say her name
And call her to his side at the cusp of eternity
