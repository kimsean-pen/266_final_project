(Alan Parsons/Eric Woolfson)

Well, even the longest night
Won't last forever
But too many hopes and dreams
Won't see the light
And all of the plans I make
Won't come together

Something in the air
(Something in the air)
Maybe for the only time in my life
Something in the air
(Something in the air)
Turning me around and guiding me right

And it's a prime time
Maybe the stars were right
I had a premonition
It's gonna be my turn tonight
Gonna be my turn tonight

Well, even the brightest star
Won't shine forever
But all of the hands I play
Are working out right
And every move I make
Feels like a winner

Something in the air
(Something in the air)
Maybe for the only time in my life
Something in the air
(Something in the air)
Turning me around and guiding me right

And it's a prime time
Maybe the stars were right
I had a premonition
It's gonna be my turn tonight
Gonna be my turn tonight
Gonna be my turn tonight

(Something in the air)
(Something in the air)

And it's a prime time
Maybe the stars were right
I had a premonition
It's gonna be my turn tonight
Gonna be my turn tonight
Gonna be my turn tonight
Gonna be my turn tonight
