Just when it falls apart
And when it's time to start
Will you sit down here for another day
And when it's time to be
All the things that we
Are wishing away for another day

Cos in my soul we know where we're goin
We're goin where the grass is green,
the air is clean and the good times are growin'

So take me away
Just for today
Cos I'm sat here on my own
I'd like to be
Under the sea
Where they'd probaly need a phone

And just when it falls apart
And just when it's time to start
Will you sit down here for another day

Cos in my soul we know where we're goin
We're goin where the grass is green,
the air is clean and the good times are growin'

So take me away
Just for today
Cos I'm sat here on my own
I'd like to be
Under the sea
Where they'd probaly need a phone

I could be you
If I wanted to
But I've never got the time
You could be me
And pretty soon you will be
But you're gonna need a line

Need a line
Need a line
Need a line
