Money moans calls you home
Vacant eyes they won't tell a soul
You fooled me once, now I'm twice as old
See, I ain't gonna lie but I ain't gonna phone you
No, I ain't gonna try to forget what I've gone through

Got a little box yeah
I'm gonna open
Take your promises
'Cause they've all been broken

Everybody knows about what you do
Everybody saw and sold the truth
I was young and gullible
But baby I grew
Now the whole world's watching you

Hands to the bone, hands to the heart
Bodies alone, they hide in the dark
But is it a fight worth fighting?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
See, I ain't gonna lie
But I ain't gonna hold back
Or try to deny
You turned a damn good heart black

I got a little box yeah
I'm gonna take back
Don't make your promises
'Cause I'm finished with all that

Everybody knows about what you do
Everybody saw and sold the truth
I was young and gullible
But baby I grew
Now the whole world's watching you
Everybody knows about what you do
Everybody saw and sold the truth
I was young and gullible
But baby I grew
And now the whole world's watching you

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh
