Far from these lands
where gods mercy doesn't reach
where the words of the jew sheyherd have forgotten
cremated in the flame of hatred

There the love for Adams children
reased to exist and withered away
The shadow has build its kingdom
and a new black God risen to his glory

We are the black arrow
poisoned by the snake
aimed at holy done
from the bow of the fallen angel

The ritual of cursing life
we drink the rotten blood,
from the skull of gods creation
with the death of believers of Christ in our minds

In the stenght of the dead rats
Your burning piety rooled
Your belief is foltering
and once you denial your own god...

We are the black arrow
poisoned by the snake
aimed at you
from the bow of fallen angel
