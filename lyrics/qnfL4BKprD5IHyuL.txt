Put on your best clothes
We've been waiting too long for this moment
I'll put on my best smile
I'm shining inside and I'm proud of our love, but

Everytime I turn around you say
That you're not checking for love in that way, but
Everytime I come around you seem
So ready for this

Showtime, our love's coming out
Lights camera action, show what we're about, cause it's
Showtime, our love's breaking out
Let's show the world you're my boy, I'm your girl, cause it's
Showtime, our love's coming out
Lights camera action, let it all hang out, cause it's
Showtime, yeah our time is now
Let's show the world you're my boy, I'm your girl

Let's break a leg out there
This could be the start of the rest of our lives
I've got so much to share
And I'm ready to put it all out there for you

But, everytime I come around you seem
So afraid of what people might say
But, can't you see it's a game they play
Trying to cast a shadow on our love

Showtime, our love's coming out
Lights camera action, show what we're about, cause it's
Showtime, our love's breaking out
Let's show the world you're my boy, I'm your girl, cause it's
Showtime, our love's coming out
Lights camera action, let it all hang out, cause it's
Showtime, yeah our time is now
Let's show the world you're my boy, I'm your girl

Cause I, wanna love you when I wanna
Wanna love you where I want to
Wanna touch you when I want to
Wanna kiss you when I wanna

Showtime, our love's coming out
Lights camera action, show what we're about, cause it's
Showtime, our love's breaking out
Let's show the world you're my boy, I'm your girl, cause it's
Showtime, our love's coming out
Lights camera action, let it all hang out, cause it's
Showtime, yeah our time is now
Let's show the world you're my boy, I'm your girl

Cause it's, not fair to love you in chains
It's not fair to love you in chains
