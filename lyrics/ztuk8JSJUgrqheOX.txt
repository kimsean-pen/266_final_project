Your thoughts are dirty
And your clothes are too
Just passed thirty
And you don't know what to do

Your flat is empty
And your heart is too
There's space for rent
But not enough for two

You don't
Know what to do
You don't
Know what to do

Your thoughts are dirty
And your clothes are too
Just passed thirty
And you don't know what to do

Don't
Know what to do

Yeah you don't
know what to do

You don't
Know what to do
You don't
Know what to do
