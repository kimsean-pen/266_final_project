Can see it from the way you're looking at me
You don't think I'm worth your time
Don't care about the person that I might be
Offended that I walk the line

So what if I'm not, so what if I'm not
Everything you wanted me to be?
So what if I am, so what if I am
More than you can see

When you treat me like that, when you treat me like that
It's pushing me harder, it's pushing me harder
When you're breaking my back, when you're breaking my back
I only get stronger, I only get stronger

I should've walked away one year ago
When you said I couldn't make it out alive
When you treat me like that, when you treat me like that
I only get stronger, I only get stronger
When you treat me like that

As far as I can tell it's kinda crazy
That you even care at all
Convincing everybody you can save me
But you're the one who made me fall

So what if I'm not, so what if I'm not
Everything you wanted me to be?
So what if I am, so what if I am
More than you can see

When you treat me like that, when you treat me like that
It's pushing me harder, it's pushing me harder
When you're breaking my back, when you're breaking my back
I only get stronger, I only get stronger

I should've walked away one year ago
When you said I couldn't make it out alive
When you treat me like that, when you treat me like that
I only get stronger, I only get stronger
When you treat me like that

Why you wanna see me bleed?
Why you wanna watch me fall apart?
Tryna find the worst in me
But I won't follow you into the dark

When you treat me like that, when you treat me like that
It's pushing me harder, it's pushing me harder
When you're breaking my back, when you're breaking my back
I only get stronger, I only get stronger

I should've walked away one year ago
When you said I couldn't make it out alive
When you treat me like that, when you treat me like that
I only get stronger, I only get stronger
When you treat me like that
