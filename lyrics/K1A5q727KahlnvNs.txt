13 days since you left me wondering what it all meant
Was I just something for the moment?
21 questions weighing on my brain

I wanna dance 'til I'm drunk on the feeling
Dance like it's my first time
I wanna dance 'til I speed up the healing
Get up, show you what I find

Somebody like you
Somebody like you that I could dance to this to
Somebody like you
Somebody like you that I could dance to this to, that knows what to do
Somebody like you that I could move to this to
Until our bodies are singing hallelujah

Somebody like you
Somebody like you that I could dance to this to
Somebody like you
Somebody like you that I could dance to this to, that knows what to do
Somebody like you that I could move to this to
Until our bodies are singing hallelujah
Singing hallelujah

Want to taste you
On that lips to make you jealous
Make me forget I feel much better
But you move those hips
So come on, press it next to mine

You really help, really help with my emotions
Like no one else
Oh my god, it gets me going
I surrend, I surrender my devotion
As long as it is

Somebody like you
Somebody like you that I could dance to this to
Somebody like you
Somebody like you that I could dance to this to, that knows what to do
Somebody like you that I could move to this to
Until our bodies are singing hallelujah

Somebody like you
Somebody like you that I could dance to this to
Somebody like you
Somebody like you that I could dance to this to, that knows what to do
Somebody like you that I could move to this to
Until our bodies are singing hallelujah
Singing hallelujah

We move in time, our steps align
I grace on high, hallelujah
Oh, me and you, boy, I can move
Your power pulls me under

Somebody like you
Somebody like you that I could dance to this to
Somebody like you
Somebody like you that I could dance to this to, that knows what to do
Somebody like you that I could move to this to
Hallelujah
Oh, somebody

Somebody like you
Somebody like you that I could dance to this to, that knows what to do
Somebody like you that I could move to this to
Until our bodies are singing hallelujah
Hallelujah, oh
Singing hallelujah
Until our bodies are singing hallelujah
