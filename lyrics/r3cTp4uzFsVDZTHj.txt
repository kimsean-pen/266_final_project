Sometimes you take it too far, going at the deep end
Uh huh, uh huh
No matter what the deal, babe, you know that I'll be there
Uh huh, uh huh
If we lose our way, let the world start to creep in
Uh huh, uh huh
Can't let nobody's words be the why we ain't speaking
Uh huh, uh uh

Only the birds and the bees know we go
Little bit high, Little bit low
Cause we've come, we've come so far, oh baby
Baby, too much is not enough
All the things that we do for love
Cause we've come, we've come so far, oh baby
When you coming around?

'Cause nothing else matters like us
And nothing else matters like love
I don't wanna fight, not tonight
'Cause we're having fun now
And nothing else matters like us
And nothing else matters like love
You've just gotta believe, if it leaves
That it's coming back around

And I don't really care about nothing else
Nothing else matters
Yeah, no, nothing else

I told ya don't let me down, I know you never did
And I don't want ya, don't want ya, this time now

I got the lock, give you the key
Look at us now, still you and me
Man, we come, we come so far, oh baby
So when you coming around?

'Cause nothing else matters like us
And nothing else matters like love
I don't wanna fight, not tonight
'Cause we're having fun now
And nothing else matters like us
And nothing else matters like love
You've just gotta believe, if it leaves
That it's coming back around

And I don't really care about nothing else
Nothing else matters
Yeah, no, nothing else

No, I don't want, don't want nobody else
And I got you, I got you all to myself
All of them, all the boys will never be you now
I give it all, all to you, so baby, don't let me down
You love so deep, your body on me
I'm all the way up when I got you on my scene
We got it all, babe, right where we want it to be
I told you no-no-nothing else matters to me

I said, 'cause nothing else matters like us
And nothing else matters like love
I don't wanna fight, not tonight
'Cause we're having fun now
And nothing else matters like us
And nothing else matters like love
You've just gotta believe, if it leaves
That it's coming back around

And I don't really care about nothing else
Nothing else matters, yeah, no, nothing else
I don't really care about nothing else
Nothing else matters, yeah, no, nothing else
