it's far from simple
and as usual
I'm stepping further
away from comfortable

I'm not done
till I've told everyone
goodnight from
a thousand places
I'm not done
till I've seen everything
and you can't even remember our faces

just face it
there's no changing me

I know you hate me
but that's ok
'cause I promise it's no deeper than my own
'cause I promise we're both better on our own

just like
the sun on your face
just like
the dirt on your grave
I am never going away

I just can't take how it feels
and now I'm standing alone

there's no hell
more imprisoning
than the memories
that you left with me

I know you hate me
but that's ok
'cause I promise it's no deeper than my own
'cause I promise we're both better on our own
