Nothing lasts forever
I just walk my way

We're not done with our life
Why can't we see eye to eye?
We're not done with our life
Will you just leave me alone
What's the point of thinkin' 'bout(one's) life
Our journey ain't fair after all so why don't you all
find your own life. you only live once!
Now I know from the bottom of my heart
People around me don't accept for the path I've taken
That's why I decided to go for what I wanna do.

何と引き換えになっても
決して消えないから
Whatever!
I go my way!! I go my way!!
I am not living for you!
今やっと言葉にするから!
もう僕には I don't care!!
I go my way!! I go my way!!
I can't stand it anymore!
僕だって変わるから!
will never be the same again!!
We're not done with our life
Why can't we see eye to eye?
We're not done with our life
Will you just leave me alone

何もかも捨ててまで
自分変えるつもりなんかないから!
I can't wait!! and lead my own way!
何したって バカにされ
気付けばほら、また一人ぼっち 今
誰かの為に生きてる訳じゃない!!
無駄な事なんてないから!
最後の最後まで...
Lead my way

In time, you will know
That you all can't win against me
Gather your luck cause it won't last forever
You can't do anything on your own right?
Get out from my first story
Done living days after days implying your feelings
Spoiled but I like to live my own life
crazy? or you?
No way I'm gonna lose
If you're going to tell me what to do
I'll be the hater if that's what it takes
This is my policy
Sick of being pushed around
It all comes down to me
Move, or it's over, just like that!!

Break my way
Find my way
We will live our life!!
いくら願っても想っても
もう戻れないんでしょ?
誰だって何か背負った上で必死に生きてて
迷っても悩んでも
変わることはないから!
こうやって最後まで叫び続けるの!

Whatever!
I go my way!! I go my way!!
I am not living for you!
そうやって必ず見つけて
もう誰にも will not say!!
絶対などないから希望捨てないんでしょ?
僕だって気付いてる!
will never be the same again
We're not done with our life
Why can't we see eye to eye?
We're not done with our life
Will you just leave me alone
