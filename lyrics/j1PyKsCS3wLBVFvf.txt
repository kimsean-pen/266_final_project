I love the time
and inbetween
the calm inside me in the space
where I can breathe

I believe there is a distance
I have wandered to touch upon the years of
reaching out
and reaching in
holding out
holding in.

I believe
this is heaven
to no one else but me
and I'll defend it as long as
I can be
left here to linger
in silence
if I
choose to
would you
try to
understand.

I know this love
is passing time
passing through like liquid
I am drunk in my desire
but I love the way you smile at me
I love the way your hands reach out and
hold me near.

I believe.

I believe
this is heaven
to no one else but me
and I'll defend it as long as
I can be
left here to linger
in silence
if I
choose to
would you
try to
understand.

Oh the quiet child
awaits the day
when she can break free
the mold that clings like desperation.

Mother
can't you see I've got to
live my life the way I feel is
right for me
might not be right for you but it's
right for me.

I believe...

I believe
this is heaven
to no one else but me
and I'll defend it as long as
I can be
left here to linger
in silence
if I
choose to
would you
try to
understand it.

I would
like to
linger
here in
silence
if I
choose to
would you
try to
understand...
