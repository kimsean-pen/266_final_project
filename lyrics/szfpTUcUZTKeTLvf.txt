We lay awake
Silent in the dark
You don't have to hide a trace

Emptiness left its mark

Ring of ice, ring of ice, round your heart

Ring of ice, ring of ice, break apart
We are lonely people

Wearing in a ring of ice
Dancing in the night

Trying to disguise
All that lies behind
Countless empty lies
Wearing a ring of ice
I walk alone
Searching for a sign
Someone else must be alive
With warmth behind their eyes
Ring of ice, ring of ice, round your heart
Ring of ice, ring of ice, break apart
All the lonely people
Wearing a ring of ice
Dancing in the night
Trying to disguise
All that lies behind
Countless empty lies
Wearing a ring of ice
Ooooh...
All the lonely people
Wearing a ring of ice
Dancing in the night
Trying to disguise
All that lies behind
Surrounded by a ring of ice
Dancing in the night
Trying to disguise
All that lies behind
Surrounded by a ring of ice
Dancing in the night
Trying to disguise
All that lies behind
Surrounded by a ring...
