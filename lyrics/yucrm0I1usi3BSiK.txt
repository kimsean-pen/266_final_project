When radiation fades and remnants dissipate
Sacrificed we reunite in obedience
Decayed and lapsed in entropy
Bewailed, intoned the last elegy

Elapsed this diminished last piece of time
Shattered, convulsed, distressed in clarity

Diluvium
A vortex of primordial black holes
Unbound
Diluvium
A stream into nothingness, unleashed

Drowned evaporation
Enduring lucent purity
Grand deprivation
Eternal cosmic unity

When resplendence elapsed
And fragments abrogates
Consecrated we insist in allegiance
Constrained and deformed in ecstasy
Enrapt, entranced in parity

Bygone this languished finite state of mind
Battered, relinquished, distraught deformity

Diluvium
A vortex of primordial black holes, unbound
Diluvium
A stream into nothingness, unleashed

Drowned evaporation
Enduring lucent purity
Grand deprivation
Eternal cosmic unity

Elapsed this diminished last piece of time
Shattered, convulsed, distressed in clarity

Diluvium
A vortex of primordial black holes
Unbound
Diluvium
A stream into nothingness, unleashed

Drowned evaporation
Enduring lucent purity
Grand deprivation
Eternal cosmic unity.
