we wander through the darkness of the day
To show me where the years have slipped away
It's hollow sounds are fade to gray
So give your fingers one day crave

The fliers bloomed as prices plunged
Your fatal grounds are laying in the mud
We said to death not to wait
Brings among what was at night
No find me why the crows fly
With my fatal ground
Prison I am drawing
Drinking the tears from the bleeding eyes
The murder
The murder
The murder she cries
The murder cry
The murder she cries

We wander through the darkness of the day
To show me where the years have slipped away
It's hollow sounds are fade to gray
So give your fingers one day crave

With my fatal ground
Prison I am drawing
Drinking the tears from the bleeding eyes
The murder
The murder
The murder she cries

The murder cry
The murder she cries
