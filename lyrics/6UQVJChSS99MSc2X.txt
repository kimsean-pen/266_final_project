The Road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began
Now far ahead the Road has gone
And I must follow, if I can

Nêbâ
Bîtham
Magâ
Nanê

I tuo, I macil
Nai lelyat túrenna!

Hey ho! To the bottle I go
To heal my heart and drown my woe
Rain may fall and wind may blow
But there still be many miles to go
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain
And the stream that falls from hill to plain
But better than rain or rippling brook
Is a mug of beer inside this Took!
