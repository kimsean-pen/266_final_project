I've been, I've been
I've been holding on and hard time take it
I've been holding on and hard time take it anymore
I've been holding on and hard time take it
I've been holding on and hard time take it anymore
I've been holding on and hard time take it
I've been holding on and hard time take it anymore
I've been holding on and hard time take it
I've been holding on and hard time take it anymore
I've been holding on and hard time take it
I've been holding on and hard time take it anymore
I've been holding on
And hard time take it
I've been holding on
And hard time take it anymore, anymore, anymore!
I've been holding on and hard time take it
I've been holding on and hard time take it anymore
I've been holding on and hard time take it
I've been holding on and hard time take it anymore
I've been holding on and hard time take it
I've been holding on and hard time take it anymore
I've been holding ooon!
I've been holding ooon!
