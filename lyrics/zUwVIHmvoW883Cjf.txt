Gonna build a rocket
Anytime you want it
Paint it pretty colors
Gonna light it up and take us to the moon
That's what I'm gonna do
That's what I'm gonna

Save up all the paper
Gonna need later
Maybe take a minute
To get to my head directions of the way
You want to get away
I'm taking you

Through the eyes of the black hole
And the open doors
Through the cracks in the pavement
In conversation

From the top of the empire
To a state unknown
If I say that I'm leaving
Just got to hang on

'Cause we're just stars
Tryn'a get back to where we're from
One by one, we're gonna leave this planet
So don't look back
'Cause you know that it's all just time,
When you've got nothing on your mind,
You've made it

Somewhere in the future
Talk about forever
Take yourself a picture
Waiting in the rain for a postcard from the sun
The one that never comes
The one that never shows
The one that never-
Is building something

From the heart of the wreckage
In another zone
Are we losing our balance?
I think we've got vertigo

From the top of the empire,
To a state unknown
If I tell you I'm leaving
Just got to hang on

'Cause we're just stars
Tryn'a get back to where we're from
One by one, we're gonna leave this planet
So don't look back
'Cause you know that it's all just time
When you've got nothing on your mind
You've made it

From the top of the empire

I think we've got vertigo

'Cause we're just stars
Tryn'a get back to where we're from
One by one, we're gonna leave this planet
So don't look back
'Cause you know that it's all just time
When you've got nothing on your mind
You've made it

'Cause we're just stars
Tryn'a get back to where we're from
One by one, we're gonna leave this planet
So don't look back
'Cause you know that it's all just time
When you've got nothing on your mind
You've made it
