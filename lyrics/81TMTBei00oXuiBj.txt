Landscapes of frozen methane
Vast fields of blue dust before my eyes
I was sent here to describe and tease
The minds of the fantasy kings of my homeland
On a ship of curiosity I sail
Oh what treasure can be found here!
And why must eyes face this
Unearthly show of morbid climate
Behind the Neptune hillsides
They say the towers stand tall
Built by hands dissimiliar to mine
And Brought alive
By hearts of ancient alien cultures
