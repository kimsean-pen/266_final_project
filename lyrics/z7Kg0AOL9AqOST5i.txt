Rise in Glory!
Rise from the flames and come out from the shadows
And let your dead eyes glow wherever you roam!
A dark millennium of evil and sin
Amass the black arts as the tide is turning
Rivers of poison, oceans of depravity
By the hands of the antagonist
Winds of fire, storm of the apocalypse
Proclaim the relentless return of Satan!
Crush all morality and bring forth the Beast
Hunt down the weaklings and abase all that is holy
Nail them to the cross
Thorns shall carve
Nail them to the cross
Angels weep
Nail them to the cross
Eradicate "God"
Nail them to the cross
Divinity is me
Now set aflame their sanctuaries of light
In masses they burn and the flame reach higher
The winds keep howling
As we reinstate the unholy art, of human sacrifice
Let them be heard, all the trumpets of glory
And let the sound of doom deafen their cries
For we shall strike as one with victory at hand
To conquer all, to reinstate the unholy
Rivers of poison, oceans of depravity
By the hands of the antagonist
Winds of fire, storm of the apocalypse
Proclaim the relentless return of Satan!
Crush all morality and bring forth the Beast
Hunt down the weaklings and abase all that is holy
Nail them to the cross
Thorns shall carve
Nail them to the cross
Angels weep
Nail them to the cross
Eradicate "God"
Nail them to the cross
Divinity is me
