I think you took my heart away when you said you're leaving
'Cause right now I am hurting all over again
And I never thought that I'll be in this place, is this a mistake?
And now I don't know how much more that I can take

I'm breaking at the cracks and everything goes black
It's another heart attack and I can't handle that
Whoa, love I need you back

I know that I'll get through this, the feeling's stronger somehow
I got my feet back on the ground and I'm turning around
And I'll be everything you always said that I could be
If only you'll be waiting right here for me patiently

I'm breaking at the cracks and everything goes black
It's another heart attack and I can't handle that
Whoa, love I need you back

Oh, never would I take you back
My heart was filled with love
And I wipe these tears and I will laugh
If only I could make it last, make it last

Breaking at the cracks and everything goes black
It's another heart attack and I can't handle that
Whoa, love I need you back

I need you back, I need you back
I need you back, I need you back
I need you back, I need you back
I need you back, I need you back

I need you back
Love, I need you
Love, I need you back
I need you back, I need you back
