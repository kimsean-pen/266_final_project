Come on, talk me to stay, I dare you to
Running, running out of time, what can I do?
Everlasting never lasts if you refuse
To commit, to never stay away

Everything gets out of hand when you're in doubt
Pulling me is what I need to push you out
Everybody, lose control, but you my dear
Got you far, so far and help can't bring you here

It's ok, you can't be my lover
It's ok, I can get another
Here you'll stay, please don't bother
I'll make my own way

It's ok, you can't be my lover
It's ok, I can get another
Here you'll stay, please don't bother
I'll make my own way

Won't you please leave me be?
Won't you please leave me be?
Won't you please leave me be?
Won't you please leave me...

It's ok, you can't be my lover
It's ok, I can get another
Here you'll stay, please don't bother
I'll make my own way

It's ok, you can't be my lover
It's ok, I can get another
Here you'll stay, please don't bother
I'll make my own way

Won't you please leave me be?
Won't you please leave me be?
Won't you please leave me be?
Won't you please leave me...
