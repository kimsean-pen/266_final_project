Fell asleep on the hardwood floor
3 o'clock in the afternoon
I awoke to a pale blue sky
And the song of an old friend
Took me back to our life, ooh

I don't live anymore
I don't live anymore

All the ashes of our days are ether and wood
All the ashes of our days are ether and wood

Oehohohoh oooohh
Ashes, ashes
Oehohohoh oooohh
Ashes, ashes

I walked through the house we built
Saw the life I left behind
Ivory paint
Cracked and peeled on the walls
The hydrangea and red rose
Strangled by vines, ooh

I don't live here anymore
I don't live here anymore

All the ashes of our days are ether and wood
All the ashes of our days are ether and wood

Oehohohoh oooohh
Ashes, ashes
Oehohohoh oooohh
Ashes, ashes

Next thing I knew her spirit called
She took shelter in my whomb
And I felt her tiny feet
Kick me from the inside
And when I looked into her dark eyes
She couldn't help but cry - ooh

I don't live there anymore
I don't live there anymore

All the ashes of our days are ether and wood
All the ashes of our days are ether and wood

Oehohohoh oooohh
Ashes, ashes
Oehohohoh oooohh
Ashes, ashes
Oehohohoh oooohh
Oehohohoh oooohh
Ashes, ashes
