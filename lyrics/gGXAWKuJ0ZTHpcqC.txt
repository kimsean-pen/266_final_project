You"ll never know
Only my soul
Bares the truth
Cares for you
Only my soul
And you"ll never see
Stays here with me
Overload, nothing more
Only my soul

Knew you were ready
Because you had no answers for me

Take me back to where love grows
Because I don't want to be here anymore

Take me back to where love grows
I don't want to be here anymore
