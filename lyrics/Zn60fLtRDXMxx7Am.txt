You hold my hand and tell me it's fine
It's getting rough but we're still alive
You hold me close your hair against mine
I love you so I'll be there hold tight

I'll be around
As soon as I leave this town
And we will be alright
Alone in the sunlight
And time is moving slow
As your hair starts to grow
I'll be with you sometime
Alone in the sunlight

I want to but I can't articulate
My feelings but I know you feel the same
As others come and go we still remain
I feel as close as we both separate

I'll be around
As soon as I leave this town
And we will be alright
Alone in the sunlight
And time is moving slow
As your hair starts to grow
I'll be with you sometime
Alone in the sunlight

I'll be around
As soon as I leave this town
And we will be alright
Alone in the sunlight
And time is moving slow
As your hair starts to grow
I'll be with you sometime
Alone in the sunlight

I'll be around
As soon as I leave this town
And we will be alright
Alone in the sunlight
And time is moving slow
As your hair starts to grow
I'll be with you sometime
Alone in the sunlight
