I want to live in a land of lakes
Where the great waves break
And the night runs right into the day
I wanna be with ones I left

But I'm way out West
And the years keep on slipping away
Want to run on the sacred dunes
Through the ancient ruins

Where the fires of my ancestors burn
I remember the fateful day when I ran away
And you told me I couldn't return

You made me swear I'd never forget
I made a vow I'd see you again
I will be back one day
And I'll find you there by the great big lake

I been running a long, long time
Trying to flee that life
But I can't seem to leave it behind

Wanna visit the windswept shores of the time before
When the moon and the stars were aligned
I remember the bright spring day
When you sparked a flame

And a fire that continues to burn
I remember the day I left headin' way out West
When you told me to never return
You made me swear I'd never forget
I made a vow I'd see you again
I will be back one day
And I'll find you there by the great big lake
I will be back one day
And I'll find you there by the great big lake
