Drinking enough to knife to death the dumb down
Drinking yourself to death am I in touch now
You ask me how to cure your headache, use a gun
If you think you're doing something special, it's been done
So just think dumb

Think harder, sip up, sick up, your life just think dumb
Think harder, sip up, sick up, your life just think dumb
Think harder, sip up, sick up, your life just think dumb
Think harder, sip up, sick up, your life

Don't leave out the sure to itch in your opinion
The louder they come, the thicker they are so dream on
If you think you got style in your limo to a club
You may feel like a kick but the coma looks more fun
So just think dumb

Think harder, sip up, sick up, your life just think dumb
Think harder, sip up, sick up, your life just think dumb
Think harder, sip up, sick up, your life just think dumb
Think harder, sip up, sick up, your life

Drinking enough to knife to death the dumb down
Drinking myself to death am I in touch now?
You ask me how to cure your headache, use a gun
If you think you're doing something special, its been done
So just think dumb

Think harder, sip up, sick up, your life just think dumb
Think harder, sip up, sick up, your life just think dumb
Think harder, sip up, sick up, your life just think dumb
Think harder
Think harder
Think harder
Think dumb

Think harder, sip up, sick up, your life
Think dumb
Think harder, sip up, sick up, your life
Think dumb
Think harder, sip up, sick up, your life
Think dumb
Think harder, sip up, sick up, your life
