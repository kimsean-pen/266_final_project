I am full of my day
And afraid of tomorrow
It seems so far away
A day is straight as an arrow
I've been running my head
I only say yes or no
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
As an escape from commotion
I've been trying to act
Like things pass by in slow motion
As a matter of fact
I choose the lighting on stage
Finally coming of age
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head

I am full of my day
And afraid of tomorrow
It seems so far away
A day is straight as an arrow
I've been running my head
I only say yes or no
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
As an escape from commotion
I've been trying to act
Like things pass by in slow motion
As a matter of fact
I choose the lighting on stage
Finally coming of age
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am full of my day
And afraid of tomorrow
It seems so far away
A day is straight as an arrow
I've been running my head
I only say yes or no
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
As an escape from commotion
I've been trying to act
Like things pass by in slow motion
As a matter of fact
I choose the lighting on stage
Finally coming of age
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head

I am full of my day
And afraid of tomorrow
It seems so far away
A day is straight as an arrow
I've been running my head
I only say yes or no
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
As an escape from commotion
I've been trying to act
Like things pass by in slow motion
As a matter of fact
I choose the lighting on stage
Finally coming of age
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
I am in over my head
