This ships set sail
sail on you and me
This ships set sail
I just wanted to be free

So maybe we will fail
fail to not see
maybe we will fail
but at least we will be free

You stand so holy
nah don't sit down
join the feet all marching
across the ground

This place so lonely
but nah don't settle down
just hear the beat drown over
all this lonesome sound

It's a sad song that makes a man put
money before life
a sad song that puts a man for sale
A sad song that make a man put
money before life

How many asses are you gonna have to sell
We were born as animals
we were born as animals and we bros
But you put suits on animals
you try to put suits on animals but we bros

We bros you lost man
we bros so long
put away your guns man
and sing this song

We bros you lost man
we bros so long
put away your guns man
and sing this song

We bros you lost man
we bros so long
put away your guns man
and sing this song

We bros you lost man
we bros so long
put away your guns man

And I said the mountain wont go falling
if your still willing to climb
but when the mountain goes falling
true riches you will find

Nah we were born as animals
born as animals and we bros
But you
put suits on animals
you try to put suits on animals but we bros

We bros you lost man!
We bros so long!
Put away your guns man!
And sing this song!

We bros you lost man!
We bros so long!
Put away your guns man!
And sing this song!

We bros you lost man!
We bros so long!
Put away your guns man!
And sing this song!

We bros you lost man!
We bros so long!
Put away your guns man!
And sing this song!

We Bros, We Bros
We Bros, We Bros
We Bros, We Bros
We Bros, We Bros
We Bros, We Bros
We Bros, We Bros
We Bros, We Bros
We Bros, We Bros...
