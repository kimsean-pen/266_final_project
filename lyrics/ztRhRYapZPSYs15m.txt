You got a boyfriend and he's a total loser
All your friends tell you that he's got no future
But they like me
Just saying
He barely takes you out and if he does he's late
And when the check comes he always makes you pay
I'd never do that
Just saying
You should leave him, 'cause it really makes me sick
Just saying
Just saying
You don't need him, I'll help you get over it
Just saying
Just saying
When you change your mind, I'll be waiting
'Cause I'm better than him
Just saying
When you change your mind, I'll be waiting
(Just saying)
Got a big house, he says he lives alone
But when I drove by I can see his mum was home
I got my own place
(He totally lies to you)
Just saying
He says he loves you, but it's all an act
He's seeing someone else, from behind your back
You know I'd never do that
(He'd never do that)
Just saying
You should leave him, 'cause it really makes me sick
Just saying
Just saying
You don't need him, I'll help you get over it
Just saying
Just saying
When you change your mind, I'll be waiting
'Cause I'm better than him
Just saying
When you change your mind, I'll be waiting
Just saying
Just saying
You should leave that guy, 'cause it really makes me sick
Just saying
Just saying
You don't need him, I'll help you get over it
Just saying
Just saying
When you change your mind, I'll be waiting
'Cause I'm better than him

When you change your mind, I'll be waiting
