It was cold, we were laying by the lake
And oh, that's when I made my first mistake
I was sold, yeah, I thought that it was fate
Oh no, that's when I first felt my heart break

Lust, it made us hungry like the wolves
We chose to act like fools
We were young, thought we were wildly in love

But I wasted all my youth on you
Wasted all my youth on you
Oh, wasted youth
Oh, wasted youth

You, you stole the better parts of me
Cruel, you took my good and left no peace
Soon, there'll be no beauty left to see
Truth, wish I could erase memories

Lust, it made us hungry like the wolves
We chose to act like fools
We were young, thought we were wildly in love

But I wasted all my youth on you
Wasted all my youth on you
Oh, wasted youth
Oh, wasted youth

If I had the chance to take it back
I'd waste it again, waste it again

Wasted all my youth on you (wasted my youth, wasted my youth)
Wasted all my youth on you (you-u-uth)
Oh, wasted youth
Oh, wasted youth

If I had the chance to take it back
I'd waste it again, waste it again
