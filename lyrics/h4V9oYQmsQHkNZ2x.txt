There are black pots hangin' round the sink
Before we stop to think
We're not the ones who need a drink
Before we stop to think

And we stop to catch our breath
And we stop fearing our death
That's when we die
And we stopped to tear apart the clock from our beating heart

We would write our songs slow
And we tried to speed them up
We would write our songs soft
Then we'd try to make them tough

And we stop to catch our breath
And we stop fearing our death
That's when we die
