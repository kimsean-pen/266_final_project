Tile floor of the bathroom, scrubbed clean and bright
Checkerboard white and gray
Towels from the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Kingston, Jamaica
I can still see the rust colored stains today

The stage is set, someone's going to do something someone else will regret
I speak in smoke signals and you answer in code
The fuse will have to run out sometime
Something here will eventually have to explode, have to explode

You and me lying on the tile floor, trying to keep cool, restless all night
Sweating out the poison as the temperature climbs
Staring up, up at the hundred-watt light that burns above
Name one thing about us two anyone could love

We roll out the red carpet when rotten luck comes down the road
Five, four, three, two, one, watch for the flash
Something here will eventually have to explode
Have to explode
