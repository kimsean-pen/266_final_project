I can never tell what you want from me
Seems like you always gotta keep me guessin'
I don't care about your company
Just the fact that I'm alive is a blessin'
It's been a dark summer cause I keep my blinds shut
Thinkin' that the weather make it better, it don't
I took a lot of time tryna make my mind up
While you tellin' me that I'ma be fine cause I won't
Now I'm waitin' for the time, I could make a move
I'ma get it and run it right back
Cause now I'm far too tired of waitin' on it
I know they be hatin' on it
You know that ain't a thang to me
Have you ever felt alone, it's a crazy thing
I could feel it all the time, it amazes me
I could wait a lot of time but nothin' change for me
So everytime I fall it ain't a thang to me
Mama call me on the phone say she pray for me
I'ma make it through it's just another day for me
Time's hard but I'ma go harder
So I need somebody there, let me know will you wait for me
Let me know will you wait for me
Let me know will you wait for me
Have you ever felt alone, it's a crazy thing
I could feel it all the time, it amazes me
I could wait a lot of time but nothin' change for me
So everytime I fall it ain't a thang to me
