Everything around me seems so much
Different than where I'm from
And at this rate I think my fate's been sealed
This life's so unpredictable
We'll go 'cause we need to live a life that no one knows
Where's this gonna go?

Right here, right now
This is the beginning of the end
And I won't sing a single thing until we can get this right
I'm moving on, I'm moving on

Hey mom, I wrote you some soft songs
And tell dad I'm just fine
We had to choose, we made our moves
And now we gotta go, go

Everything about me seemed so much different when I was young
I couldn't wait to take my place
5 years have passed, good God have I been gone?
So why, I've never felt so alone in my whole life
Time's not on my side

Right here, right now
This is the beginning of the end
And I won't sing a single thing until we can get this right
I'm moving on, I'm moving on

Hey mom, I wrote you some soft songs
And tell dad I'm just fine
We had to choose, we made our moves
And now we gotta go, go

And why's this make me so nervous?
Why does everything go wrong?
Why's this make me so nervous?
And why does everything go wrong?

I'm holding on to a fairy tale
We're moving forward but we're not there yet
I'm holding on to a fairy tale
We're moving forward, we're moving forward

I'm holding on to a fairy tale
We're moving forward but we're not there yet
I'm holding on to a fairy tale
We're moving forward, we're moving forward

Hey mom, I wrote you some soft songs
And tell dad I'm just fine
We had to choose, we made our moves
And now we gotta go
And why's this make me so nervous?
And why does everything go wrong?
Why's this make me so nervous?
And why does everything go wrong?
