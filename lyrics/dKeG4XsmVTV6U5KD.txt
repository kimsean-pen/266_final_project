One of these days the sky's gonna break
And everything will escape and I'll know
One of these days the mountains
Are gonna fall into the sea and they'll know

That you and I were made for this
I was made to taste your kiss
We were made to never fall away
Never fall away

One of these days letters are gonna fall
From the sky, telling us all
To go free
But until that day I'll find a way
To let everybody know that you're coming back
Mmmm you're coming back for me
Cause even though you left me here
I have nothing left to fear
Fears are only walls that hold me here
Hold me here
Hold me here
Hold me here
Only walls that hold me here

One day soon I'll hold you like the sun
Holds the moon
And we will hear those planes overhead
And we won't have to be scared
Cause we won't have to be
Yeah...
Cause we wont have to be, yeah, scared, no

You're coming back for me
You're coming back for me
You're coming back for me
You're coming back for me

You're coming back for me
You're coming back for me
You're coming back for me
You're coming back for me

You're coming back for me
You're coming back for me
You're coming back for me
You're coming back for me

You're coming
You're coming back for me
You're coming back for me

You're coming back for me
You're coming back for me
You're coming back to me
You're coming back to me

You're coming back for me
You're coming back
