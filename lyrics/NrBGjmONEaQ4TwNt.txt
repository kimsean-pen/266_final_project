Pull him away
Jealous so with me
Go there for new
For new things there

Singing on a famous street
I want to love; I've all the wrong glory
Am I just in Heaven or Las Vegas?
But you're much more brighter than the sun is to me

He's a hustler
It's a role he'll never make suit
Hang on to this
Stay and stay and fail and fail

Pull him away
Jealous so with me
Go there for new
For new things there

Singing on a famous street
I want to love; I've all the wrong glory
Am I just in Heaven or Las Vegas?
You're so much more brighter than the sun is to me

Reaching this itch in my soul
Is like any good playing card
Must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas
Why it's more brighter than the sun is to me

Carnivals are bluster loud
I'm dizzy so I go under the Big Dipper
Come fantasy for a carnival
How fitting before a wedding

Singing on a famous street
I want to love; I've all the wrong glory
Am I just in Heaven or Las Vegas?
But you're much more brighter than the sun is to me

Reaching this itch in my soul
Is like any good playing card
Must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas
Why it's more brighter than the sun is to me

Maybe then you will swear
This is hardly personal
I suspect I'm singing to a tune
And still find that beats singing to you soon
