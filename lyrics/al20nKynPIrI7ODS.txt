You want me to come over I got an excuse
Might be holding your hand, but I'm holding it loose
Go to talk then we choke its like our necks in a noose
Avoid the obvious we should be facing the truth

Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes imagine life with out ya

And the love kick starts again
Starts again

And the Love kick starts again
Starts again

It's the same old you the same old me
You get bored and I get cold feet
Get high get wandering eyes
Forget I've never ever had it so sweet
I realize what I got when I'm out of town
Cause deep down you're my girl in a golden crown
My princess and I don't wanna let you down
No, I don't wanna let you down, down, down, down

You want me to come over I got an excuse
Might be holding your hand but I'm holding it loose
Go to talk then we choke it's like our necks in a noose
Avoid the obvious we should be facing the truth

Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes imagine life with out ya

Kick starts again

Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes imagine life with out ya
Imagine life with out ya
Imagine life with out ya
Imagine life with out ya

And the love kick starts again
Starts again

And the love kick starts again
Starts again

Kick kick starts

It's the same old you the same old me
You get bored and I get cold feet
Get high get wandering eyes
Forget I've never ever had it so sweet
I realize what I got when I'm out of town
Cause deep down you're my girl in a golden crown
My princess and I don't wanna let you down

Kick kick starts

Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes imagine life with out ya

And the love kick starts again
