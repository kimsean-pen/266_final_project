On the count of 3
What if we both stopped
Over
Overthinking everything

Maybe finally
You and I can be on the same
Same page, wavelengths

Is this for real?
No heads or tails?
I'm head over heels
Hope you feel the same

You once asked me
Have you stopped to think this through?
This through? no clue?
Yeah me too

I inconveniently
Enter a dream state around you, around you

Is this for real?
No heads or tails?
I'm head over heels
Hope you feel the same
