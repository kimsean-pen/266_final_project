Chalked up in a city street
Broke glass in bloody scene
Young guns that are half my age
Baghdad after Monterey
Cell phones and the magazines
Death bombs and the human beings
Hate war and diamond rings
Nightmares and silly things
How does anybody sleep at night?
Out of mind and I'm out of sight
Out of love and we just begun
Living large in America

But I found, one last thing
To believe in
But I found, one last thing
To believe in

Close calls and were holding on
Police lines and fire alarms
High winds with a heavy fall
Dead birds and a parking stall
How does anybody sleep at night?
I lay in bed and I close my eyes
I try to rest but it starts to hurt
Living here is a lot of work

But I found, one last thing
To believe in
But I found, one last thing
To believe in
But I found

(Transmission)
I was told
To breathe in the most righteous breath
A feeling of heartfelt purpose
A sense of hope
For something bigger than ourselves
