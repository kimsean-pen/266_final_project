Can't find my doctor
My bones can't take this ache
If you dance with the Devil
Your day will come to pay

Downtown

Fuel injected dreams
Are bursting at the seam
Am i in Persia
Or am i just insane?

Downtown, downtown

One foot in the grave
Such a foolish child
For a date with death
Sign the dotted line

I've been thru hell
And I'm never goin' back

Dancing on glass
Professional class
Dancing on glass
Never goin' back
Come on, dancing on glass
Dancing on glass
Dancing on glass

Going way too fast
Gonna burn and crash
Valentine's in London
Found me in the trash

Downtown

Need one more rush
Then I know, I know I'll stop
One extra push
Last trip to the top

Downtown, downtown

Silver spoon and a needle
Witchy tombstone smile
I'm no puppet
I engrave my veins with style

I've been thru hell
And I'm never goin' back

Dancing on glass
Professional class
Dancing on glass
Never goin' back
Come on, dancing on glass
Professional class
Dancing on glass
Never goin' back
Come on, come on
Dancing on glass

Dancin'
D-D-D-D-D-D-Dancin'

(Sweet Chiva, you were my Jesus)
