Sneak in the pillow, under the sheets
I know a place where everyone meets
But she knows a place where the cops don't go
And she'd be the one if anyone knows
If half the fun was to cut and run
And the other half was getting caught
Then don't stop (don't stop)
She was the daughter of a cop
Don't stop (don't stop)
Daughter of a...
Making love is an easy thing to do
And she didn't feel like pushing herself
But don't be fooled 'cause it could've been you
Or him, or anyone else
If half the fun was to cut and run
And the other half was getting caught
And when the fix comes in
She'll get a slap on the wrist
And leave you in a cell to rot
So don't stop (don't stop)
She was the daughter of a cop
Don't stop (don't stop)
The daughter of a cop
Don't stop (don't stop)
The daughter of a cop
Don't stop (don't stop)
The daughter of a cop
