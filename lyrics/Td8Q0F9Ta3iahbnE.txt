Let's go down by the grapevine
Drink my daddy's wine, get happy
Down by the grapevine
Drink my daddy's wine, get happy, happy

Oh, sweet blindness
A little magic, a little kindness
Oh, sweet blindness
All over me

Four leaves on a clover
I'm just a bit of a shade hung over
Come on baby, do a slow float
You're a good looking riverboat
And ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me?

Down by the grapevine
Drink my daddy's wine, good morning
Down by the grapevine, drink my daddy's wine
Good morning, morning

Oh, sweet blindness
A little magic, a little kindness
Oh, sweet blindness
All over me

Please don't tell my mother
I'm a saloon and a moonshine lover
Come on baby, do a slow float
You're a good looking riverboat
And ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me?

Don't ask me
'Cause I ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinking
Ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinking
Ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinking
Wine of wonder, wonder by the way

Oh, sweet blindness
A little magic, a little kindness
Oh, sweet blindness
All over me

Don't let daddy hear it
He don't believe in the gin mill spirit
Don't let daddy hear it
He don't believe in the gin mill spirit

Come on baby, do a slow float
You're a good looking riverboat
And ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me, good to me?
Now, ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me?
