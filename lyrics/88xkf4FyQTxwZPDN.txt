You know you don't understand
You were told, You can't comprehend
You flow
It was something someone said somewhere
So low
I don't know what to do
I'm going to lose my mind
I don't know what to do
I'm going to lose my mind
I don't know what to do
I'm going to lose my mind

I know what to do
I'm going to lose my mind
I know what to do
I'm going to lose my mind
I know what to do
I'm going to lose my mind
I know what to do
I'm going to lose my mind
I know what to do
I'm going to lose my mind

I don't know what to do
I'm going to lose my mind
