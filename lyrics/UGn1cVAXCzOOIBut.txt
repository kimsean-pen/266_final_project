Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know
It's been coming for some time

When it's over so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know
Shining down like water

I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day

Yesterday and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know
Been that way for all my time

'Til forever on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know
It can't stop, I wonder

I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day
(Yeeaahh)

I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day
