I broadcasted your face onto my TV screen
I compared our facial features with a mirror
I just wanna be around you every single day
Is it weird that I've been thinking about you?
I know the normal thing to do would be to talk to you
But I won't

And I read through all the e-mails that you wrote to me
And again the ones that I sent back to you
Hope I can be important in your life some day
Is it wrong that I've been thinking about that?
I just wanted to leave a message, no need to call back
Bye bye
