Bodies, please don't cry
bodies, don't die
bodies, please don't cry
bodies
I been taking all the silver
i been saving all the gold
i'm gonna stuff it down the throat
of a week old corpse
save that doggone soul
I been saving up my pain
i'm gonna give it back in spades
i been strangling the cries
from the murder of love
save your soul tonight
Bodies, please don't cry
bodies, don't die
bodies, please don't cry
bodies
I'm gonna save
I been raising up the dead
gonna send them to the house of cain
i been praying in light
of the waning moon
slay your doggone soul
I been taken out of heaven
i been put upon this world
i been walking up and down
to and fro
to save your doggone soul
I got bodies on the left
i got bodies on the right
i got bodies up and down
all across town
save your soul tonight
Bodies, please don't cry
bodies, don't die
bodies, please don't cry
bodies
I got bodies on the left
i got bodies on the right
i got bodies up and down
all across town
save your soul tonight
Bodies, please don't cry
bodies
i'm gonna take 'em up
i'm gonna take 'em up
i'm gonna take 'em up
oh yea
i'm gonna take 'em up
