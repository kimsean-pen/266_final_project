I'ma do it, do it like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like you ain't never known me before
I'ma bring it bring it, I'ma give it give it
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before

Too nice, too clean, too white, too green
Little haters, big dreams
I don't care what you think about me
Two faced old friends told me the end was near
Ha! Forget them, see, a lot of things changed since then
Don't they know that I came from Nebraska?
Am I gonna quit? Nice of you to ask, but
Momma told me go and chase what you after
I'm on track so I'm gonna rap faster
I'm gonna break it down for you and get a little deeper
Slayin' on it, prayin' on it
Like a Grim Reaper
Running on thermometer, yup, I got a fever
Hi, konnichiwa, are you a believer?

I'ma do it, do it like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like you ain't never known me before
I'ma bring it bring it, I'ma give it give it
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before

Too hard, too soft, too rough, too posh
Lemme do what I want
Lace it up, baby, tie it in a knot, uh
Race track, two legs, Hollywood, big break
Suck it up, intake
Let me tell ya how it happened real quick, ohh!
Touchdown in the middle of the city
Mass Ave. street, jammed up to Newbury
Million dollar party, now, tell me who you wearing
Lots of new hand held hype you can carry
I'mma break it down for you and get a lil' deeper
Slayin' on it, prayin' on it like a grim reaper
Running on thermometer, and yep I got a fever
Hi, konnichiwa, very nice to meet ya

I'ma do it, do it like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like you ain't never known me before
I'ma bring it bring it, I'ma give it give it
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before

Let me keep going
Baby, 'til I'm dead and gone
That's my only wish
And if you don't know
I'll be singing my song
I got a lot to give

I'ma do it, do it like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like you ain't never known me before
I'ma bring it bring it, I'ma give it give it
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
