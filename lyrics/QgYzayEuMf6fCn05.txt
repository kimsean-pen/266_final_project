Have I told you of the dark in me
Go easy on me, please
Have I told you of the vice I need
Go easy on me, please
Any style you want
I can leave it right here
Or slide it back beneath
But if you knew
You might leave me too
Let's see where we lie
In five years time
Let's see where we lie
In five years time
Let's see where we lie
In five years time
Is it simple, is it brave enough?
To go gentle
In to the cut
Any particular time
That you feel it all move?
That you fell it all move?
Cos' if you knew you might leave me too
Let's see where we lie
In five years time
Let's see where we lie
In five years time
Let's see where we lie
In five years time
Since 'sayonara'
Sign my name & time
And cursed every thought I had
Of leaving her crying
I've bought more presents for Jennifer
I'm towing the line
So let's see where we lie
In five years time
Let's see where we lie
In five years time
Let's see where we lie
In five years time
Let's see where we lie
In five years time
