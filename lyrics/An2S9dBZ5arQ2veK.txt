I don't how it happened but something came over me
Separate what I have to do from where I want to be
Backed up against the wall
I do it to myself
Always wanting more even when I get it
So I beg and plead for the unattainable
Once I have it, I lose interest just as fast
Fuck this anyway
Do I have to learn to live craving more than I'm given?
Fuck it all anyway
I will never be appeased
I don't know what's wrong with me
I will never be appeased
Panic in a post-apocalyptic state of mind
Manic mending severed satisfaction all the time
I always think there's more to find
One day I'm a wreck the next I'm fine
Fuck this anyway
Do I have to learn to live craving more than I'm given?
(Not enough!)
Fuck it all anyway
I will never be appeased
I don't how it happened but something came over me
Separate what I have to do from where I want to be
Can't get away from this space
Can't rip away, I'm displaced
Displaced
Once again, was it meant?
Everything feels different
Never sure, does it last?
Everything goes too fast
In the back of my head I become embedded long before I know
Should I want to be around you and the rollercoaster virtues?
I don't want to know what you do, when I'm gone
Cause I'm gone...
