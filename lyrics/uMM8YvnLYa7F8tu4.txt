Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, she's got it bad
She thinks that she could have it all
So she holding on for something more
She sees the writing on the wall
But she still has her doubts
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I was trying hard
He knew that it was over long before he began to see the end
But still he keeps on trying, we all do what we can
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Caught a ride with an old friend
It was a bad trend
And it was a bad scene
Headed down to the south folk
You know with one word but I know what you mean
He was an honest man
He was an honest man
Steady as she goes
She walks a tight, tight wire high up above the ground
And everybody knows he can't stay out forever
There's laws that will ll pull you down
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Caught a ride with the north wind
It was a bad trend
And it was a bad scene
Headed down to the south folk
You know with one word but I know what you mean
Yes, I know just what you mean
He was an honest man on a lost highway
We all know what we can, he was going my way
Caught a ride with an old friend
It was a bad trend
And it was a bad scene
Headed down to the south folk
You know with one word but know what you mean
Yes, I know just what you mean
He was an honest man
He was an honest man
He was an honest man
He was an honest man
