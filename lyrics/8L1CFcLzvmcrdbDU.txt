Anything is better than an emptiness and hopelessness
Suffering is where I see the truth in you
You're the arsonist that makes sense of this, I can't resist
In the flames, I feel a part of you, you

It's the only way to reach through
It's a path to the divine
It's the only place I go to
When dark and light collide

So burn me out
Use me 'til there's nothing
My heartbeat down
Kill me from inside
Burn me out, I need to feel alive
It's never enough, never enough

Take what you want from me
Take what you want from me
Take what you want from me
Burn me out, come burn me out

Nothing eats away like the cold regret you can't forget
Isolation only makes the hurt worse

It's the only way to reach through
It's a path to the divine
It's the only place I go to
When dark and light collide

So burn me out
Use me 'til there's nothing
My heartbeat down
Kill me from inside
Burn me out, I need to feel alive
It's never enough, never enough

Take what you want from me
Take what you want from me
Take what you want from me
Burn me out, come burn me out

Take what you want from me
Take what you want from me
Take what you want from me
Burn me out, come burn me out

It's the only way to get through
To where I know myself

So burn me out
Use me 'til there's nothing
My heartbeat down
Kill me from inside
Burn me out, I need to feel alive
It's never enough, never enough

Take what you want from me
Take what you want from me
Take what you want from me
Burn me out, come burn me out

Take what you want from me
Take what you want from me
Take what you want from me
Burn me out, come burn me out

Come burn me out
Come burn me out
Come burn me out.
