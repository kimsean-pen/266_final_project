You come along, you come along
And wash away the rain
You are the sun, you are the sun
That leads me babe, to where I belong
Where I come from
Because of you, I know where I belong

You're a new song
You're a new song baby
You're a new song to me
You're a new song
You're a new song baby
You're a new song to me

I was, I was, I wasn't wrong
To think, to think that it was wrong for me
I want, I want it, I want it all
I want, I want, I want it all so sweet
You got the moves, you got the moves
You got the moves, bang bang baby
You got the moves, you got the moves

I have never felt this strong
Dancing to you all night long

You're a new song
You're a new song baby
You're a new song to me
You're a new song
You're a new song baby
You're a new song to me

You're a new song
You're a new song baby
You're a new song to me
You're a new song
You're a new song baby
You're a new song to me

Dancing to you all night long
Dancing to you all night long (you're a new song baby)
Dancing to you all night long (you're a new song to me)

You're a new song
You're a new song baby
You're a new song to me
You're a new song
You're a new song baby
You're a new song to me
