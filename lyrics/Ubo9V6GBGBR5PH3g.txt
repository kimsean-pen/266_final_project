I can't help it if I make a scene
stepping out of my hot pink limousine
I'm turning heads and I'm stopping traffic
When I pose they scream
and when I joke they laugh
I got a
pair of eyes that they're getting lost in
I hypnotize by the way I'm walking
I've got them dazzled like a stage magician
When I point they look
and when I talk they listen well
everybody needs a friend
and I've got you, and you and you
So many I can't even name them
Can you blame me?
I'm too famous
Haven't you noticed that I'm a star?
I'm coming into view as the world is turning
Haven't you noticed I've made it this far?
Now everyone can see me burning
Now everyone can see me burning
Now everyone can see me burning
