We come to the killers for the cure

So, cold blade, it runs
Down the center of your spine, [?] heart
Like you're running out of time, something's wrong
And your mouth's stitched up shut like waking up
With your head against the gun

Seems that the lead has got your tongue
One spoken mind will speak with lie

If you want change, you got to chase the source
We come to the killers for the cure
Only the dead have seen the end of war
For we come to the killers

Are you you when spread the tick from the hungry
Wait for soul inject the flea
To get the rich blood flowing
Your sweat is to take you out
Your fear is to drive you
On a path that grows from tears, no drought
Where blood is shed on bones

Imprisoned, it needs no locks, it needs no guards
It's not your vision, a hijacked mind won't see the bars
It's your decision to accept all things as they are
The hatred to liberate cannot take benighted hearts

You don't need to understand
You just need [?] low

If you want change, you got to chase the cause
We come to the killers for the cure
Only the dead have seen the end of war
For we come to the killers

What would you say if you weren't afraid?
What would you say? What would you change?
What would it change?
