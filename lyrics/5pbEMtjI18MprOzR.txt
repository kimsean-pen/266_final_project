The damage has been done,
I am not having fun anymore.
Do what you do when you try
what you get when you see the light,
come down i'll set my hope
in a wonderful hospital man.
We got rooms to live room to live in
room to give but no room to give in,
but you never had a chance
no you never had a chance.
To those above take us out
throw us down shove us out.
We get down so so hard.
But your vulgar display
caught me off gaurd;
Cold cold boy with an American heart
gonna run in and lock up the shots again

But Ann don't you cry, don't you cry ann,
don't you cry.
Don't you cry Ann, don't you cry,
don't you cry Ann, don't you cry.

Well my heart is not a wide open thing, I know,
there is hardly not a lot to say,
except i met her and her 5 false friends.
They go, they go

Tied, tied, tied to the tracks
just remember the facts
Repeat until you're running aground again.

But ann don't you cry, don't you cry ann,
don't you cry.
Don't you cry Ann, don't you cry,
don't you cry Ann, don't you cry.

Dear Ann, don't you cry you'll sever the love.
Take you away, don't you cry you'll sever the love
Don't you cry you'll sever the love.
Don't you believe in what they say
believe in what they say
believe in what they
leave in what they
believe in what they say 'bout me
sweet sweet Ann.
