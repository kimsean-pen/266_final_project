Say I'm leaving this babylon
It will not be too long now
It will not be too long
I said my people are starvin'
But your money's runnin'
I said my people are starvin'
But your money's runnin'
I say
Your dollar, dollar drop down real low
And you ain't got no gold to show
We gonna step right through that door
We not gonna come back no more
