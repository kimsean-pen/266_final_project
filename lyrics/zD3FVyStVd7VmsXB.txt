She lives but she don't move
She loves but she don't groove
She thinks without no reason
That girl is out of season

Louise, you don't know louise
You don't know louise, you don't know louise
(just can't please her, can't please her)

She's high but I'm so down
Her head goes round and round and round
She stares with a crystal eye
But how that girl can hypnotize

Louise, you don't know louise
You don't know louise, you don't know louise
(just can't please her, can't please her)

Louise, you don't know louise
You don't know louise, you don't know louise
(just can't leave her, can't leave her)

Well I've heard you been dreaming now that's something new
You got a school teacher to talk to you
Well you got your daddy's car when the weather's clear
But you can drive mine if you sit right here, oh yeah

Louise, you don't know louise
You don't know louise, you don't know louise
(just can't leave her, can't leave her)

Louise (just can't please her, can't leave her)
