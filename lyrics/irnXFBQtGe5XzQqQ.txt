The blinds here are so sharp and they cut,
The light from the primitive sun
You know I really wanted her
Society thinks so highly of
this hotel I vomited on
Before I lost the sight of her
My man, he quietly closes the door
now the pharaoh is woken,
My hands, I feel like I've been here before
She has already spoken

Anyway
There's no reason to get hurt
You don't need to sell your shirt
To do the devil's work

You finally found your place
You know it always works
You know it always works

I saw someone who looked like you on
The platform at Bondi
station
But from a younger era
The lights in the bellhouse were still on
We all need somebody to love,
Be we clothed or naked.

My man, he quietly closes the door
Now the pharaoh is woken

Anyway

To do the devil's work.

You finally found your place
You know it always works
You know it always works

You finally found your place
