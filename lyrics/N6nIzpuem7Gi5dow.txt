You remember your first kiss?
Well how can I forget?
My hand still shivers from the very thought of it

Well sometimes I almost regret it
like I regret my regrets.
I see myself on my deathbed saying
"I wish I would have loved less".

But that's when the feeling hits,
so just lick your lips.
These are the good times that you'll miss
when you are sipping on the sweet nectar of your memories

Just take a sip
and let it wet your lips
You won't understand all this until you're
sipping on the sweet nectar of your memories

Last night I ran into my old life,
still waiting for someone at the station
Someone who never made it into my new life
So I called up Lisa
'Cause she's my only friend
"Lisa I don't know anymore,
every heartbeat needs a reason"

She said
"That's when the feeling hits
so just lick your lips
can you smell the spring time in the breeze
you gotta stop sipping on the sweet nectar of your memories"

I take a sip
I let it wet my lips
I think back on that kiss
I gotta stop sipping on the sweet nectar

That's when the feeling hits
