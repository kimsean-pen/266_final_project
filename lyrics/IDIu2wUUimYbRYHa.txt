When I was just a girl, I felt just so alone;
Locked myself in closets thinking if I was the only one...
Dim light shining on my room,
Locked up in this old raccoon...

Look at me, I'm just a girl still feeling so alone,
Looking at myself thinking faster coming or easy go.
Street lights shining on my room,
Locked up in this old cocoon...

All I wanted was the dream of being left with you...
All I wanted was the dream of being left with you...
All I wanted was the dream of being left with you...
All I wanted was the dream of being left with you...

When I was just a girl, I wore a thousand lives,
In and out of searching for the thing that makes me feel alright...
Ten black moments in my room;
Diamond shimmers from the moon...

And now I'm just a girl living in the satellite,
Taking what I need from this town and getting down at night...
Street lights shining in my room,
Getting out here sometime soon...

All I wanted was the dream of being left with you...
All I wanted was the dream of being left with you...
All I wanted was the dream of being left with you...
All I wanted was the dream of being left with you...
