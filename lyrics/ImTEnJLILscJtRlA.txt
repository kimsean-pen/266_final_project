I was born on a Saturday
My dad he held me screaming in his arms
He can talk like it was yesterday
When I got that holy water in my eye

It's alright, is it just alright?
See all those faces coming down
Trying not to let them down
This time, babe, is that alright?
Well, I can still see the sun on the water
I can still feel your sunlight

And all I ever wanted was time
You know that all I ever wanted was time

And I know that I come on strong
Forgive me, I just couldn't help myself
And I have changed, but I'm better now
And I see you in this new and perfect light

You're so fine, you're oh so fine
See all those faces coming down
Trying not to let them down
This time, babe, is that alright?
Well, I can still see the sun on the water
I can still feel your sunlight

And all I ever wanted was time
You know that all I ever wanted was time

You know that all I ever wanted was time
You know that all I ever wanted was time
You know all that we ever really needed was time
