Oh to find
Another lover
Oh to lie
In the bed of another
Breaking the bread
And raising the silver there
With you

And I dreamed your face
In the Mexican summer
With Texas above
To die with my brother
Breaking the bread
And raising the silver there
With you

And I dreamed your face a million times
And I vowed to get you out
And I dreamed your face a million times
And I vowed to get you out
And I dreamed your face a million times
And I vowed to get you out
Of here

Oh to find
Another lover
Oh to lie in the
Bed of another
Breaking the bread
And raising the silver there
With you
