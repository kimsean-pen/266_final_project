You said you didn't want to be friends;
I left you waiting on the weekend
I'm sad, that you're sad
What's new? You're dropping out of college;
I'm pissed I wish you were an honest man

I'm confined to sheds with artificial light
I can see you anywhere I look
With you inside, I'd say things I couldn't rectify
The world can't stay the same you're not a book

Life sucks you sounded disappointed;
So you packed left town to Oregon
I'm sad, that you're sad
Thought I saw you sleeping at a bus stop
But I wiped my eyes and you're not there
