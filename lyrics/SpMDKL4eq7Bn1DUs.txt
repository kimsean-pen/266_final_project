Are they calling for our last dance?
I see it in your eyes ... in your eyes
Same old moves, for a new romance
I could use the same old lines, but I'll sing
Shine on, just shine on
Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
They can scream and shout,
that they've been sold out But it paid for the cloud that we're dancing on
So shine on, just shine on
With your smile just as bright as the sun
Cause they're all just slaves to the gods they've made
But you and I, just shone, just shone
And when silence greets my last goodbye
The words I need are in you're eyes
And I'll sing ...
Shine on, just shine on
Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
They can scream and shout that they've been sold out but it paid for the cloud
that we're dancing on
So shine on, just shine on
With your smile just as bright as the sun
Cause they're all just slaves to the gods they've made
But you and I just shone, just shone
So shine on, just shine on
Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
They can scream and shout
that they've been sold out
but it paid for the cloud that we're dancing on
So shine on, just shine on
With your smile just as bright as the sun
Cause they're all just slaves to the gods they've made
But you and I just shone, just shone...
