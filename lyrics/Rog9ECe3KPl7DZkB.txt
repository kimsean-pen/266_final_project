Mama says, "Truth is all that matters
Lying and deceiving is a sin"
Drifting through a world that's torn and tattered
Every thought I have don't mean a thing
Don't stop, don't stop the dance
No more music
Don't stop the dance
Mama says, "Love is all the matters
Beauty should be deeper than your skin"
Living for the moment, lips and lashes
Will I ever find my way again?
Don't stop, don't stop the dance
Don't stop the dance
Don't stop, don't stop the dance
Mama says, "Only stormy weather
Don't know why there's no sun in the sky"
Footsteps in the dark come together
Got to keep on moving or I will die
Don't stop, don't stop the dance
No more music
Don't stop the dance
Don't stop, don't stop the dance
No music
Don't stop the dance
Don't stop, don't stop the dance
