Pin someone against the wall
Dial the number, make the call
Street lights on the girls ahead
Painted cheeks and ruby red

Can you hear me?
Can you hear me screaming loud?

All that glitter, all that foreign gold
Love all night and live before we're old
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me screaming loud?
All that glitter, all that foreign gold

Drown your sorrows at the bar
Touch the sky and count the stars
What you get is what you see
Shock you like you won't believe

Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Can you hear screaming loud?

All that glitter, all that foreign gold
Love all night and live before we're old
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me screaming loud?
All that glitter, all that foreign gold
