Talking to myself
But I can't hear over your mouth
I'm thinking out loud
What's keeping me around?
What's keeping me chained down to shapes and sounds
Your parents car and your town?

I'm nervous about staring across the room
And waiting for the walls to move
I don't see anybody else
And I don't need anybody else
I'm dirt beneath your feet
Step all over me

I don't see anybody else
And I don't need anybody else
And I don't see anybody else

Oh, use me
