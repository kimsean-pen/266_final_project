Into pain and into terror, in denial
Under pressure, under cover, under fire
Understand, under duress that I can kill
A daily battle to contain the way I feel
A daily battle to contain the way I feel

Pressure is building up inside my brain
Slowly, so I don't notice
Driving me insane

Over exaggerated, over all the pain
Over the mountain, I've been climbing up in vain
Over, under, over compensating dream
A daily battle to convey just what I mean
A daily battle to convey just what I mean

Pressure is building up inside my brain
Slowly, so I don't notice
Driving me insane

And then one day I just start walking
No direction, no one talking
Scattered images in mind
Don't bother what I leave behind
