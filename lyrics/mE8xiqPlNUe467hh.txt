It was our own fault that we couldn't stand our ground
the eternal winter is near
a million lives just wiped away without a sound
leaving a dead world in fear
no need to run, we're just waiting for someone
no eyes to see what we have become

We should die for the things we believe in
But live our lives in the dark, self-deceiving
In the snow, all the world that we knew is ice
and so we are: cold, dead and gone
Shine a light till the dark sky is burning
Wolves are hownling and fortune is turning
But our hearts and the words that we say are ice
and so we are: cold, dead and gone

Betrayed by greed and pride we stumbled through the dark
confusing blind men with kings
how can we ignite the flame while missing the true spark
or have we reached the end of things .
no need to run, we're just waiting for someone
no eyes to see what we have become

We should die for the things we believe in
But live our lives in the dark, self-deceiving
In the snow, all the world that we knew is ice
and so we are: cold, dead and gone
Shine a light till the dark sky is burning
Wolves are hownling and fortune is turning
But our hearts and the words that we say are ice
and so we are: cold, dead and gone
