Yeah I would wake up next to you if I could
And I would stare straight past them all to you
I could never say it like I sang it
Drunk dialing, 'cause we're faded, yeah
But I'll be, I'll be, I'll be the first to say

You could be my mistake
I know I want it but I can't stay
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
You could be my mistake
I know I want it but I can't stay
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
That it's a little too late
A little too late
A little too late

A little too late

And when the sun comes up again
And we're gone
We'll remember every beautiful thing that went wrong

I could never say it like I scream it
Drunk dialing, cause we're faded

But I'll be, I'll be, I'll be the first to say
You could be my mistake
I know I want it but I can't stay
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
You could be my mistake
I know I want it but I can't stay
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it

That it's a little too late
A little too late
A little too late

You could be my mistake
I know I want it but I can't stay
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
You could be my mistake
I know I want it but I can't stay
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
You could be my mistake
