I like when you sing to me
watching your hips take lead
I want you to feel loose
shoot me with those eyes
brushing down your thighs
I can't help but want you

My hands around you
your lips I'll lean to
I'm thrilled about you

Red to our cheeks
bliss down our feet
I won't spin without you
hold you close and tight
thirst quenched with mine
temptation surrounds through

My hands around you
your lips I'll lean to
I'm thrilled about you

I've been waiting for you
