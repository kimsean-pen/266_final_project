Sparks turn to flames (flames)
When hearts start to chase (chase)
You'll fall if you run right into the smoke (yeah)
The lights start to deem when it's almost enough
But flames light this place (place)

Fireflies tonight (tonight, tonight)
'Cause, love lights the sky
Hey, yeah

So put it up in, put it up in the air (air)
Put it up in, put it up in the air
So put it up in, put it up in the air (air)
Put it up in, put it up in the air

Baby, tell me right that you share (oh, oh)
That's the loving put it in the atmosphere (here we go)
If you want you put more
Living in the air (oh)
Just keep your attention so the clouds go nowhere (oh)
Just please light this place, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (oh)

Fireflies tonight (tonight, tonight)
'Cause, love lights the sky ('cause, love, burn)
Hey, yeah

So put it up in, put it up in the air (oh, won't you put it)
Put it up in, put it up in the air (oh, won't you put it)
So put it up in, put it up in the air (oh, won't you put it)
Put it up in, put it up in the air (oh, won't you put it, here we go)

So put it up in, put it up in the air (oh, won't you put it)
Put it up in, put it up in the air (put love in the air)
So put it up in, put it up in the air (oh, won't you put it)
Put it up in, put it up in the air (oh, won't you put it)

Let it burn, burn
Let it burn, burn
Let it burn, burn
Let it burn, burn, oh, oh

Fireflies tonight (tonight, tonight)
'Cause, love lights the sky ('cause, love, burn)

So put it up in, put it up in the air (oh, won't you put it)
Put it up in, put it up in the air (oh, won't you put it)
So put it up in, put it up in the air (oh, won't you put it)
Put it up in, put it up in the air (oh, won't you put it, here we go)

So put it up in, put it up in the air (oh, won't you put it)
Put it up in, put it up in the air (oh, won't you put it)
So put it up in, put it up in the air (oh, won't you put it, put love in the air)
Put it up in, put it up in the air (oh, won't you put it)
