Silence the words
Falling like walls
Borders comfort
Borders comfort
But you won't hear me
My only truth
Take it and burn it
Just don't leave it
Buried in me
Silence the words
Falling like walls
Borders comfort
Borders comfort
But you won't hear me
My only truth
Take it and burn it
Just don't leave it here with me
It walks these halls
And I need sleep
It walks these halls
And I need dreams
But not to dream
But not to dream
It walks these halls
And I need sleep
But you won't hear me
You won't hear me
You won't hear me
My only truth
My only truth
Take it and burn it
Just don't leave it
Buried in me
