I am on the rock and then i check a stock
i have to run like a fugitive to save the life i live
i'm gonna be iron like a lion in zion (repeat)
iron lion zion
i'm on the run but i ain't got no gun
see they want to be the star
so they fighting tribal war
and they saying iron like a lion in zion
iron like a lion in zion,
iron lion zion

I'm on the rock, (running and you running)
i take a stock, (running like a fugitive)
i had to run like a fugitive just to save the life i live
i'm gonna be iron like a lion in zion (repeat)
iron lion zion, iron lion zion, iron lion
zion iron like a lion in zion, iron like
a lion in zion iron like a lion in zion
