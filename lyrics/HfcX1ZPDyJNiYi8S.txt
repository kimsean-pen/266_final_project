Too fast, by the end
Too scared to prove what you said
I save multitudes
For you for I
And no one else

Got hit
I fell in, in heavy dreams
Face it
Got scared
I recline in my aptitude for waiting
So long, so long

Unscathed
Compromise my summer mood
Pacing my street, neighbourhood
All without you, wasted
So long, so long
