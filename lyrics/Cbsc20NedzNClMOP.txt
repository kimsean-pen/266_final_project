The one who has fallen
Wrapped in nocturnal despise
Surrender of the cosmic lie

Conjuration, evoke above and below
Arcane, occult, clandestine stars witnessed

The one who has drowned
Enshrouded in splendor so bright
Inclination of the blackest light

Fragrance of the perished, redemption revealed
Slaver, strive, iniquitous life redeemed in wrath

Invocation, ascend to its source and
Crave, cure, purity, the surrender of cosmic lies

In revelation, fathomless glory
Sacrificed mortals, a scorned trinity
