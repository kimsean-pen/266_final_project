If you miss the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow
A hundred miles
Lord I'm one...
Lord I'm two...
Lord I'm three...
Lord I'm four...
Lord I'm five hundred miles
from my home
500 miles
500 miles
500 miles
500 miles
Lord I'm five hundred miles
from my home
Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny to my name
Lord I can't go home
This away...
This away...
This away...
This away...
This away...
Lord I can't go home
This away
If you miss the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow
A hundred miles
