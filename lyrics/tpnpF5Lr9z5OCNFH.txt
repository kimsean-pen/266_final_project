Dirty brown attire
Singing by the fire
Old rhythm blues
Strumming rusty wires

Nothing in his bag
But whisky and cologne
Waiting on the deck
For my baby to come home

There is fire in your eyes
I would jump in a heart beat?

I want, I need
I want, I need
You
I want, I need
A bad boy like you

I want, I need
I want, I need
You
Cyclic Cowboy got no rules!

Where is my bad boy boy boy boy
I want my bad boy boy boy boy
Where is my bad boy boy boy boy
Cyclic Cowboy got no rules!

Kissing in our beat up truck
Whispering witty remarks
Teasing, pleasing, then you're leaving
Slip away into the dark

Loving like a wild storm
Electric current, I am drawn
Waiting on your love like rain
Dry until you come again

There is fire in your eyes
I would jump in a heart beat?

I want, I need
I want, I need
You
I want, I need
A bad boy like you

I want, I need
I want, I need
You
Cyclic Cowboy got no rules!

Where is my bad boy boy boy boy
I want my bad boy boy boy boy
Where is my bad boy boy boy boy
I want my bad boy boy boy boy

Let's be wild horses
Ride until the morning
Lay me down, on the ground
Come into my out of bounds

Let's be wild horses
Ride until the morning
Lay me down, on the ground
Come into my out of bounds

You're the vine
I'm the grape
Pick me, whip me
Into shape

Earth shakes when you take
Take me baby, take me take
Crack that whip and crack it quick
Whip me 'till I lose my grip

Love is torture, love is pain
I'm so dry without your rain

Where is my bad boy boy boy boy
I want my bad boy boy boy boy
Where is my bad boy boy boy boy
I want my bad boy boy boy boy
Where is my bad boy boy boy boy
I want my bad boy boy boy boy
Where is my bad boy boy boy boy
I want my bad boy boy boy boy
