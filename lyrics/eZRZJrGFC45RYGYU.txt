Why have ourselves abandoned us?
Why they no more belong to us?
Cries in the sky pray to believe
My heart and soul will never forgive

We are all being used
Our lives have been abused
Still no one resists
I guess
There's nothing to lose
I am no longer confused
You're killing my dreams

My heart cries out for the touch I will never have
Before my eyes you've burnt everything I loved
I'm on the edge and you're forcing me not to fall
You'll never see me crawl

We are all being used
Our lives have been abused
Still no one resists
I guess
There's nothing to lose
I am no longer confused
You're killing my dreams

We are all being used
Our lives have been abused
Still no one resists
I guess
There's nothing to lose
I am no longer confused
You're killing my dreams

Why have ourselves abandoned us?
Why they no more belong to us?
Cries in the sky pray to believe
My heart and soul will never forgive

We are all being used
Our lives have been abused
Still no one resists
I guess
There's nothing to lose
I am no longer confused
You're killing my dreams

We are all being used
Our lives have been abused
Still no one resists
I guess
There's nothing to lose
I am no longer confused
You're killing my dreams
You're killing my dreams
