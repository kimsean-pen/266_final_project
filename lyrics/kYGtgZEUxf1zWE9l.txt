Spectators made sense of us
Watched parts of you I'd never touch
And how you're rolling fast away
It's terrifying

When I touch two fingers to your stomach
You ask if I feel saved
We are in the bathtub
And I am dripping water on your face
When you say
With God's hands around your neck
You felt frightened
But mostly he was making you come

Eyes unmoving
It's you or it is nothing
Is it not obvious?

Mother and wife
Mother, I tried
And lately they've become the same
The bed that I was born in
The mattress I could die with
