No doubt it's you I think and dream about
And, oh, could it be possible for you to be with me?
And are you glamor glamorous?
Shemite eyes make it so obvious

I wanna tell you, you're hard to resist
I wanna tell you, you're hard to resist

And if this is all that you know
Don't go in alone
If this is all that you know
Don't go in alone

Go away, it's time for you to come away
Oh, would you think it's hard for me to stay this way?
But are you glamor glamorous?
Shemite eyes make it so obvious

I wanna tell you you're hard to resist
I wanna tell you you're hard to resist

And if this is all that you know
Don't go in alone
If this is all that you know
Then don't go in alone
