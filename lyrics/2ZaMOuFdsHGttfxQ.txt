Life used to be good
Now look what I've done
I've ruined my temple with drugs
My mind is done

Got down in my manhood
before my time
Left in my darkness
I've lost my mind

I can't even think straight
Nobody knows what I say
Even my guitar wonders
why I can't play

No more smile I wear on my face
I've gone the last mile
And I just lost the rays

How did I get this way
It's so unreal
I'm no longer a person
I can't even feel

Got down in my manhood
before my time
Left in my darkness
I've lost my mind
