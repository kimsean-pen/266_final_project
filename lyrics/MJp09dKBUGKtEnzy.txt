Someday they'll find your small town world
On a big town avenue
Gonna make you like the way they talk
When they're talking to you
Gonna make you break out of your shell
'Cause they tell you to
Gonna make you like the way they lie
Better than the truth
They'll tell you everything
You wanted someone else to say
They're gonna break your heart, yeah

From what I've seen
You're just one more hand me down
'Cause no one's tried to give you
What you need
So lay all your troubles down
'Cause I am with you now

Somebody oughta take you in
Try to make you love again
Try to make you like the way they feel
When they're under your skin
Never once do you think that they would lie
When they're holding you
Then you wonder why they haven't called
When they said they'd call you
You'll start to wonder
If you're ever gonna make it by
You'll start to think
You were born blind

From what I've seen
You're just one more hand me down
'Cause no one's tried to give you
What you need
So lay all your troubles down
'Cause I am with you now

I'm here for the hard times
The straight to your heart times
When living ain't easy
You can stand up against me
And maybe rely on me
And cry on me, yeah

Oh no, no, no

Someday they'll open up your world
Shake you down to the drawing board
They'll do their best to change you
They still can't erase you

From what I've seen
You're just one more hand me down
'Cause no one's tried to give you
What you need
So lay all your troubles down
'Cause I am with you now

Lay them down on me
Oh yeah
You're just one more hand me down
And all those nights
Don't give you what you need
So lay all your troubles down
On me
