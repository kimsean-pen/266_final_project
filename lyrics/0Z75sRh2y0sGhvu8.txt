Gives you something you
Can do with your hands
Makes you look cool and
Feel like a man
In the morning you'll
Probably regret me

Me and your cigarettes

Started young,
It's too late to quit
Most call it a
Bad, bad habit
Your momma told you you
Could end up dead with me

Me and your cigarettes

Always there every time
You need me
It ain't love but
Just like nicotine
You're addicted to a
Feeling you can only get

From me and your cigarettes

Light us up and then
Throw us down
Walk away when we
Hit the ground
How's it gonna feel when you
Come back around here and see

Just you and your cigarettes

Always there every time
You need me
It ain't love but
Just like nicotine
You're addicted to a
Feeling you can only get

From me and your cigarettes
