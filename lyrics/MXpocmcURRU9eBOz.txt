Are you sitting at home all alone
Trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone
Praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen
A thousand times?
Maybe playing some Mayer
Getting lost in your favorite lines?

If you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it
Takes to drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

I'm one number away from calling you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl I confess
I lied when I said, "I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away

Are you stuck at a red light with a
Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror
Get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station
Replacing our favorite song?
Maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes
I'm moving on

Well if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever
It takes to outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

And I'm one number away from calling you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, "I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away

Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all?
We don't have to talk, I just wanna hear your voice

And I'm one number away from calling you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, "I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, anything I want to say
But I'm still one number away
Away
Away
Yeah I'm still one number away
