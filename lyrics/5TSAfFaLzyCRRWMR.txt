Sat on the ground in the subway station
Thursday night and everyone's gone home
I've tried to square with the things I'm feelin'
Someone come and save me, pluck me out of this hole

Forced to confront him, forced to risk
All the pleasure leads to this
Devil breathing down your back
Devil breathing down your back kinda this

Sir, please respond
Sir, please respond
I swear I'll never let it happen again
Until it do
Let you in

I let you in
Makin' me choose
So unnaturally natural
This thing you do
Breaking me down
It feels so right
It can't be wrong
Sir, please respond
Sir, please respond

Yes, sir
Sir, can I call you "Sir?"
Makin' me feel so good (it feels so right)
Make me feel so good (it can't be wrong)
Make me feel so good (it feels so right)
Make me, make me, make me, make me, make me, make me, make me,
make me, make me, make me, make me, make me, make me feel so good
You make me feel so good

I've cried tears of pain and laughter
(He's cried tears of pain and laughter)
Tears of change and happy ever after
(Tears of change and happy ever after)
I've tried to square with the things I'm
feelin' (He's tried to square with things he's feelin')
Someone come and save me, pluck me out of this hole

Wakey, wakey up at dawn, don't hurt
Don't fuck it up, fuck it up-up-up
I'm gonna blunt, force, blunt, force, blunt
Fuck it, fix it up, fix it up-up-up
Wakey, wakey up at dawn, don't hurt
Don't fuck it up, fuck it up-up-up
I'm gonna blunt, force, blunt, force, blunt
Fuck it, fix me up, fix me up-up-up

Fix me up-up-up
Fix me up-up-up
No, I don't--
No, I--
You know I know what I want
