There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home (yeah)
Seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone

And I remember what you said to me
You were actin' so strange (mmm)
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

Was it somethin' I said
To make you turn away
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
Right now

I've been sittin' here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong

I've drove myself insane
Wishin' I could touch your face

But the truth remains you're...
Gone
You're (gone)
Baby, you're (gone)
Girl, you gone
Baby girl, you're (gone)
You're (gone)
You're...

Now, I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone (no-no)
But if there's somethin' that I could do
Won't you please let me know

The time is passin' so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
And maybe I could change my every day (yeah)
But baby, I don't want to

So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you
And I know in my heart
You can't say that you don't love me too
Please say you do

Yeeaah...
I've been sittin' here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane
Wishin' I could touch your face
But the truth remains

You're... Gone
You're...(gone)
You're... Gone
You're Gone, You're...(gone)
You're...(gone)

What will I do
If I can't be with you
Tell me where, will I turn to
Baby who (will I be)
Now that we, are apart
Am I still, in your heart
Baby why, don't you see
That I need you here with me

Ohhh...
I've been sittin' here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I've drove myself insane
Wishin' I could touch your face
But the truth remains

I've been sittin' here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane
Wishin' I could touch your face
But the truth remains

You're... Gone
You're...(gone)
You're... Gone
You're... (gone)
Baby girl, you're...(gone)
You're... Gone

But the truth remains you're
