I'd like to pack this in, and take you to the stars
we'll eat at fancy restaurants and drive in fancy cars
We tried our luck, we made a buck, so lean back have some fun.
(Oh yes my love, but first just this last one.)

We stood on this cliff in a starless night
I held your hand in my mine...
so stand by me with all your heart
I need you by my side

Over the river is cold and black
and the bottom is a long way down
(another one, going underground...)
Why can't we cut the ropes and let that poor fool go.
(Don't you go getting weak on me, not when i need you so.)

We stood on this cliff in a starless night
I held your hand in my mine...
so stand by me with all your heart
I need you by my side

(Dont lose your step, now we're almost there
go wash Your face, and comb your hair
So trust me now, believe in me
forever more your love, you have pledged to me.

We stood on this cliff in a starless night
I held your hand in my mine...
so stand by me with all your heart
I need you by my side

We'll stay at home and call this day our own
listen to a record and watch a candle burn
I'm feeling kind of drowsy
there's blood on the floor.
And when I'm gone you still will have my love forevermore
My Love, Forevermore
