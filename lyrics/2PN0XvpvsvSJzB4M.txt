One too many times
I fell over you
Once in a shadow
I finally grew
And once in a night
I dreamed you were there
I canceled my flight
From going nowhere

It's all I can do
To keep waiting for you
It's all I can do
It's all I can do

One too many times
I twisted the gate
When I was crazy
I thought you were great
I kept my renditions
Of you on the wall
Where holiday romance
Is nothing at all

It's all I can do
To keep waiting for you
It's all I can do
It's all I can do

You wait in the wing
Like a Saturday flirt
Protecting the judge
You don't want to get hurt
And once in a moment
It all comes to you
As soon as you get it
You want something new

It's all I can do
To keep waiting for you
It's all I can do
It's all I can do

It's all I can do
To keep waiting for you
It's all I can do
It's all I can do

It's all I can do
To keep waiting for you
It's all I can do
It's all I can do

It's all I can do
To keep waiting for you
It's all I can do
It's all I can do
