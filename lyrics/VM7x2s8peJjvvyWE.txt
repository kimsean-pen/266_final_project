You're getting closer
Look in my eyes soldier
Your heart has everything
I need ya know
I've waited for ya
I knew that my body might choose ya
And I can't stop crying
Now you got me on my knees

Tell me now what you'd like me to do
Come and tell me what you want
Tell me now what you'd like me to do
Come and tell me what you want

When we fall into the river
Every kiss is sweet and bitter
And as long, as we're together
Every touch feels so much better
Make me stay
Make me stay
But as long as we're together
Every touch feels so much better

We're getting closer (yeah)
Let the love take over
It's time to let it go
And lose control
I already know ya
And now that you're seeing me close up
You can tell my feelings
Are the ones you really need

Tell me now what you'd like me to do
Come and tell me what you want
Tell me now what you'd like me to do
Come and tell me what you want

When we fall into the river
Every kiss is sweet and bitter
And as long, as we're together
Every touch feels so much better
Make me stay
Make me stay
But as long as we're together
Every touch feels so much better

Make me stay
Make me stay
But as long as we're together
Every touch feels so much better

When we fall into the river
Every kiss is sweet and bitter
And as long, as we're together
Every touch feels so much better
