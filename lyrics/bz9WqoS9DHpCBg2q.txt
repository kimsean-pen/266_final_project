I was five, and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

Bang, bang
He shot me down, bang, bang
I hit the ground, bang, bang
That awful sound, bang, bang
My baby shot me down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down

Bang, wiz, zap, paw
Bang, wiz, zap, paw
