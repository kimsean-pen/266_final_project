Would you mind if I touched
If I kiss, if I held you tight
In the morning light

Would you mind
If I said how I felt
Tenderly tonight

Again cause
I never, ever felt this way
In my heart before
Love has found its way
In my heart tonight, yeah

Would you mind
If I looked in your eyes
Till I'm hypnotized
And I lose my pride, yeah

Would you mind
If I make love to you
Till I'm satisfied

Once again cause
I never ever felt, felt this way
In my heart before
Love has found its way
In my heart tonight

Once again cause
I never ever felt, felt this way
In my heart before
Love has found its way
In my heart tonight

Ooh, love, would you mind
Would you mind

Gonna look into your eyes
Till I'm hypnotized
Make love to you, baby
Till I'm satisfied
