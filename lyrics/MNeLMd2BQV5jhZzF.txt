Hostility to every living creature
Like gifted intellectual commands
Inalienable is not some moving feature
It's foundation, a bedrock of the land

So it's criminal
Antithetical
Inimical
To an enlightened plan
If you seek to make
Divisible
The principle
Of the profane rights of man

And so it turns
The bourgeoisie
The bastard child of democracy
Morphs into aristocracy
Demands advantage it must not receive
But if the citizen will not stay its hand
The myth becomes a menace on the land

And it's criminal
Antithetical
Inimical
Oh, oh
Intelligence and knowledge are an ordinance
A constant check on privilege and wealth
Nurture it, provisioning a furtherance
Of fundamental democratic health

So it's criminal
Antithetical
Inimical
To an enlightened plan
If you seek to make
Divisible
The principle
Of the profane rights of man
