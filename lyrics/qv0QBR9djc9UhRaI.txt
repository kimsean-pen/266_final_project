I can hear the sound
Of sirens all around
I see blood on the ground
Blood on the ground
I hear something's breaking
A heartache in the making
Oh what have you done?
What have you done?
Because I can't cope
When you are near
Somebody save me 'cause
I can't breathe now
'N' I can't love with too many tears, oh
You're my emergency
Why do you keep selling my heart out?
You're my emergency
My emergency baby
Let me go before I will shutdown
Just let me be, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why do you keep selling my heart out?
You're my emergency
My emergency baby
I know you're no good
'N' I know that I should live without you
You're my emergency
You turn me out, turn me in
Spin me like mannequin
Up and around
You play me around
Don't want a bitter ending
But I can't keep pretending
I see through your eyes
Your brilliant disguise
Because I can't cope when you are near
Somebody save me 'cause
I can't breathe now
'N' I can't love with too many tears, oh
You're my emergency
Why do you keep selling my heart out?
You're my emergency
My emergency baby
Let me go before I will shutdown
Just let me be, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why do you keep selling my heart out?
You're my emergency
My emergency baby
I know you're no good
'N' I know that I should live without you
'Cause you're my emergency
Because I can't cope when you are near
'N' I can't love with too many tears, too many tears
Because I can't cope when you are near
'N' I can't love with too many tears, too many tears
Why do you keep selling my heart out?
You're my emergency
My emergency baby
Let me go before I will shutdown
Just let me be, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why do you keep selling my heart out?
You're my emergency
My emergency baby
I know you're no good
'N' I know that I should live without you
You're my emergency
Why do you keep selling my heart out?
You're my emergency
My emergency baby
Let me go before I will shutdown
Just let me be, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why do you keep selling my heart out?
You're my emergency
My emergency baby
I know you're no good
'N' I know that I should live without you
You're my emergency
