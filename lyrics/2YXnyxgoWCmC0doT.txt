So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong.
So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong.

Stranger to me now, coming too close,
Coming too close for comfort.
When the sun went down
Midnight pass on the air.
I sound so sure, maybe in another life
Maybe at another time.

Was there somewhere before,
I wonder as I shut the door.

So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong.
So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong.

I got your name on a matchbook,
I'll leave your things in the past.

So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong.
So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong.

I leave your books unread,
Your mouth un-kissed,
Your bed can stay unmade.
I've stepped too easily
Into possibilities.

Is it wrong that I want more,
I wonder as I shut the door.

So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong.
So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong.

I got your name on a matchbook,
I'll leave your things in the past.

So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong.
So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong.
