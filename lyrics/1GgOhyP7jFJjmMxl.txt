I wish our skin would meet
A sting I wish would bleed
Like toothpicks sliding under fingernails
Don't you need a breath of air?
'Cause you're biting at my head
Like starving great whites feeding in the deep end

And I wish I was just as strong
As I make myself out to be

I'm twisting my words to appear like
This doesn't burn 'em
Staring at the sun, papercuts are in my eyes
Shrinking our worth, mixing fiction
With crime like a substance
I'm addicted to
Diving into the salt tides

I took you like a thief
A pinch that doesn't leave
It's like ice cubes grinding at your front teeth
And I miss you while you talk
It's a comforting sense of shock
Feels like silver caught inside a toaster

And I wish I was just as strong
As I make myself out to be

I'm twisting my words to appear like
This doesn't burn 'em
Staring at the sun, papercuts are in my eyes
Shrinking our worth, mixing fiction
With crime like a substance
I'm addicted to
Diving into the salt tides
(Diving into the salt tides)

A fever that I'll never break
'Cause I keep pushing pills away
Just to see my body shake
Expensive red wine
I hate the taste
And how the slightest spoon will stain
I drink with you anyway

'Cause I know that I'm not
As strong as I make myself out to be

I'm twisting my words to appear like
This doesn't burn 'em
Staring at the sun, papercuts are in my eyes
Shrinking our worth, mixing fiction
With crime like a substance
I'm addicted to
Diving into the salt tides

I'm twisting my words to appear like
This doesn't burn 'em
Staring at the sun, papercuts are in my eyes
Shrinking our worth, mixing fiction
With crime like a substance
I'm addicted to
Diving into the salt tides

I wish I was just as strong
As I make myself out to be
