One, two, three
She holds my hand
But it doesn't feel the same
Is it in my head?
Or has she really slipped away?
Her voice, her love
Make the night shine like the sun
But her silence is cold
I feel my mind come undone
She's all I've got
But I still feel alone
Like she's already gone
So watch me now as I start fires in the dark
Show me luck, show me fate
Show me any escape
I start fires in the dark
Burning bridges and hearts to the ground
'Cause it's too late now
'Cause it's too late now
What have I done?
I've made mistake after mistake
I need someone
Why'd I tear myself away?
No empty room becomes full with a flood of light
And my world's the same
All alone in the dead of night
She's all I want
Now that I'm on my own
Now that she's really gone
So watch me now as I start fires in the dark
Show me luck, show me fate
Show me any escape
I start fires in the dark
Burning bridges and hearts to the ground
'Cause it's too late now
'Cause it's too late now
'Cause it's too late now
It's too late now
She's all I want now that I'm on my own
Now that she's really gone
So watch me now as...
I start fires in the dark
Show me luck, show me fate
Show me any escape
I start fires in the dark
Burning bridges and hearts to the ground
'Cause it's too late now
'Cause it's too late now
