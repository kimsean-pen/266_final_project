Save me
I'm lost for words
Forgive me when I'm sinking
Caught in the chase
Our days are numbered...

I always thought that I was too far gone
But you gave me a place to belong
I feel the rain washing away all that I've done wrong

Well I just wanna make you levitate
I just want you to take my breath away
Complete the frame with the piece I found in you

No, I don't wanna be something you're not
No, I would never hurt you
The circumstances change but not the thought
That I sure don't deserve you

Oh, can't you see the light?
Shining as bright as the sparkle in your eyes?
It dissipates a lesser fate
So we can see the day where not a thing has changed.
Well I just wanna make you levitate
I just want you to take my breath away
Complete the frame with the piece I found in you

No, I don't wanna be something you're not
No, I would never hurt you
The circumstances change but not the thought
That I sure don't deserve you
Just trust in me, that's all I'll say
I promise I will keep you safe
Here in my arms you'll stay
I'll see to it as long as I have you...

So I'll be all I can make
Despite all of my mistakes
I'll see to it that my word follows through.
I'll be all I can make
For our undivided sake
I'll see to it as long as I have you, if I have you...

No, I don't wanna be something you're not
No, I would never hurt you
The circumstances change but not the thought
That I sure don't deserve you
Just trust in me, that's all I'll say
I promise I will keep you safe
Here in my arms you'll stay
I'll see to it as long as I have you...
