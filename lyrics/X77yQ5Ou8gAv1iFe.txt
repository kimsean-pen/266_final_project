Bring me just a glimpse of

Love love
Love is going to come as a photographer
Yes, a photographer, yeah, yeah
I need love
So someone better bring me a photographer
Yes, a photographer, yeah

A flash
A glimpse of perfect abs
In flimsy floral dress
Shows off her slender frame
Enjoys a private stroll

Love love
Love is going to come as a photographer
Yes, a photographer, yeah, yeah

Off duty beauty
You're keeping it real
She's got flawless features
Grabs a bite to eat

Stepping out
Sports a bruise on her neck
As she's heading to, to the studio
Decadent
No, she's never been shy
No she's never, never
Never been shy

Love love
Love is going to come as a photographer
Yes, a photographer, yeah, yeah
I need love
So someone better bring me a photographer
Yes, a photographer, yeah, yeah
