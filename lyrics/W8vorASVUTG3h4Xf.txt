When I see you walk you got me weak in my knees
Grab and fill some words, I don't know what I mean
Walking in the fog and a forest of trees
You got a stoic resemblence to something I need
Oh na-na-na Oh I hope I find my way out of this one
You got a nice cold case and a stealing smart look
And you can read my apprehension like an open book
I'm calling the corner but I'm sticking around
Because I gotta see what happens and how little goes down
Oh na-na-na Oh I hope I find my way out of this one
He can spend your money and break up your mind
But you better watch out when he comes after your mind
And when he grabs hold of your soul you know you never can win
And we don't know where it ends or where it all begins
Oh na-na-na Oh I hope we find a way out of this one
Nothing you could tell me now could put me at ease
Nothing you could show me now could shake my belief
Cause strip it all down and give me only defense
But nothing I could take could crack and turn it back
I got my redemption and I got my disease
And now I can't be bothered with reality
I got my redemption and I got my disease
And now I can't be bothered with reality
Oh na-na-na-na Oh na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Oh na-na-na Oh I hope we find a way out of this one
Find a way out of this one
