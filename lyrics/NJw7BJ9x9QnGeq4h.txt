I'm smoking drain
Imma take it to the face
Imma take it to the face
When she saw me come down, I made her fall in love
Might cause a sundown, .925 my own
Neck and I'm washed out, I need a bar of soap
I'm still locked when I'm all alone
I'm still combining when I'm on my own
2 and the white light calling me like a phone
Dress up for you, yeah I feel like a college boy
Fiends in the black light, street lights carry on

I'm in dark both night and day, I want to but I can't stay
Don't know why, so I can't say
Going missing MIA
You're my drug, I'm D.E.A
Just for you, I catch a case
Just for you I cut my face
I keep going in a maze
How they change, I pump the breaks
Cut the lames, won't say a name
Pull up late, I know they hate
Pull my jewelry out the lake
You're a snake, I take your place
Gotta eat, I take your plate
I can't wait, I take it straight
I'ma take it to the face

I'm smoking drain
Imma take it to the face
Imma take it to the face
Smoking drain
Imma take it to the face
Toxic waste, I need a eight
Imma take it to the face

Lead the way, can't leave no trace
Change my shape like it's some clay
Cut the breaks and let it shake
Cross the king and get away
I see gray, like 50 shades
She want bladee, I run away
She wanna meet me at my place
Duct tape on my license plate
Stay away, I switch my state
Silver trees look like a brace
Yeah I wait for your embrace
Pledge allegiance to the rain
Yeah it's bladee, I'm just a stain
Fuck the fame, don't say my name
Yeah you fake, and its a shame
See you fail, can't look away

Imma take it to the face
Imma take it to the face

When she saw me come down, I made her fall in love
Might cause a sundown, .925 my own
Neck and I'm washed out, I need a bar of soap
I'm still locked when I'm all alone
I'm still combining when I'm on my own
2 and the white light calling me like a phone
Dress up for you, yeah I feel like a college boy
Fiends in the black light, street lights carry on

Dress up for you, yeah I feel like a college boy
Dress up for you, yeah I feel like a college boy
