Breath in and cut shorter, don't let your heart sink lower
I know we had differences but this love will last a lifetime
If we put our heads together and trace back this history
It won't take long to realize how much you mean to me
Old photographs still stuck to the door, smoke stained teeth and damp cold floors
The first time your kiss seemed softer, that one time when your heart broke harder
It's this love we never had, sometimes I think that I'm glad this hate
I miss being by your side, I need a place to hide
I've tried to forget your name
But every night seems the same
Disintegration will follow
I've never felt a pain in life so hollow
I've given up
I'm letting go
I'm so scared, of what will follow
I've never felt a pain in life this hollow
Letting go of everything i used to know
Love let me go
