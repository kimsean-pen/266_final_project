Hey now, overcome your concern about the weather
And whether or not I'm still alive
Check the vital signs
So soft spoken and shy
Never gets high anymore
Did you poison my food, forgive me I've paranoid flu

I've been lying wide awake paralyzed by the buzzing of the television
These modern things we know, getting you off
These modern things we know, getting you off

Haunting us, these different meanings and spectral beings.
We're fighting sleep with broken, rusted weaponry.
Sing so softly and low, like you want me to hear.
Stolen what you can't afford,
What's that muffle beating for?

I've been lying wide awake paralyzed by the buzzing of the television
These modern things we know, getting you off
These modern things we know, getting you off

Something I could never say, speak so softly and low.
Something I could never say.
(Yltfos os kaeps) ["speak so softly" backwards]
Something I could never say.
(Yltfos os kaeps)
Something I could never say.
(Yltfos os kaeps.)
(Speak so softly and low.)
Something I could never say, speak so softly and low.
(Speak so softly.)
(Yltfos os kaeps.)
If you love me let me go.
(Stolen what you can't...)
Speak so softly.
(Speak so softly.)
(Stolen what you can't afford, what's that muffle beat...)
(Yltfos os kaeps.)
(Speak so softly.)
(Something I can never say. Speak so softly and low.)
(Speak so... softly.)
(Yltfos os kaeps. Yltfos os kaeps. Yltfos.)
