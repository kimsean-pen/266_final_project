I am a lonely painter, I live in a box of paints
I used to be frightened by the devil
And drawn to those who weren't afraid

Remember when you told me
That love was touching souls?
Well, surely you touched mine
Part of you pours out of me
From time to time in these lines

You're in my blood like holy wine
You're so bitter and so sweet
I could drink a case of you darling
I'd still be on my feet yea
I'd still be on my feet

You're in my blood like holy wine
You're so bitter and so sweet
I could drink a case of you darling
I'd still be on my feet yea
I'd still be on my feet
