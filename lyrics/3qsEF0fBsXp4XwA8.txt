Running from the suburbs, skipping heartbeats
Living by our own front teeth
Put my faith into a number, and push the odds aside
We slowly make it out alive, but you lied
An old dream still haunts me, a time machine
I knew you then, ripped jeans in a playground of cement
I knew you then, gold rings, but you never could commit
I heard you're living somewhere upstate with a new life
Is that really what you had in mind?
But I dont wanna let go, and watch it all unfold
I couldn't if I even tried, and I tried
You left me stuck sixteen without a time machine
I knew you then, ripped jeans in a playground of cement
I knew you then, gold rings, but you never could commit
I knew you then, I knew you then
I knew you then, I knew you then
I knew you then, ripped jeans in a playground of cement
I knew you then, gold rings, but you never could commit
I knew you then, I knew you then
