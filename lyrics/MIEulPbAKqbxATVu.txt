they don't walk
they don't talk
in Malibu

they don't vote
they don't even smoke

I know your blue
I know your blue
I know your blue

they don't cream
and they don't dream
in Kansas City

they don't cry
they don't they never act

I know you're ready
I know you're ready
I know you're ready

they don't cry
and they don't die
in south Dakota
just like a seagull

they don't mash
they don't hatch
in south Dakota
in south Dakota
here comes the coda

not much water comin' over the hill
not much
not much
not much (x4)
