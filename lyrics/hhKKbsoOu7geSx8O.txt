I was amazed by your light
Taken so far back, I was hiding
I think you took me by surprise
The way you made me feel inside

It was more than just a moment shared
Like something else was in the air
I've never felt this way before
Not since ever since
You walked through that door

I don't wanna complicate you
You seem perfect the way you are
Excuse me I'm taken by the
Way that you light my fire You kidnapped the night
It's like you're walk in on the light
Like an angel in disguise
You made me forget I was tired

And then I walked up to you
As you walked up to me
It's like your eyes were make-believe
I can't breathe better me
Than you, think I should leave

I don't wanna complicate you
You seem perfect the way you are
Excuse me I'm taken by the
Way that you light my fire Light my fire
Light my fire I don't wanna complicate you
You seem perfect the way you are
Excuse me I'm taken by the
Way that you light my fire Light my fire
Light my fire
