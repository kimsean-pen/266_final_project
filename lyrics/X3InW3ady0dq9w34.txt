I guess you don't believe me now
You never wanted this
Back turned and the wind is all you have
It's all you needed

You're all right, you're all right now
(You believe what you want to)
Gone somehow, you've gone somehow
But I'm waiting for you

Get back to where you once believed
Get back, get back
You want so bad to bury me
Get back, get back

A far cry from the picture perfect calm
Or can you see it?
A bright light from a distance leaves you dark
You're never free here

You're all right, you're all right now
(You believe what you want to)
Gone somehow, you gone somehow
But I'm waiting for you

Get back to where you once believed
Get back, get back
You want so bad to bury me
Get back, get back

You never noticed what I had in mind (had in mind)
I made a way but you have run so far now
Whatever thing that you just had to find (had to find)
You'll never see it but it kills you slowly
Yeah, it's gonna kill you slowly
Yeah, it's gonna kill you slowly

Get back to where you once believed
Get back, get back
You want so bad to bury me
Get back, get back

Get back to where you once believed
Get back, get back
You want so bad to bury me
Get back, get back!
