I got everything, and I don't know what to do
I can run on the show, cut the inventory too
Howling at the moon, howling at the moon
I can throw your 45s all day to into the sun
And say goodbye
At the shooting stars, at the crashing cars
At the future past, was made to last
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know, I didn't know

At night I cry and howl at the moon
At night I cry and howl at the moon

Say goodbye for now
Never seeing it again
All the stars at night
Won't save my friends
Howling at the moon Howling at the moon
Howling at the moon Howling at the moon

And if I ever fall asleep I'll turn around and face the sea
And if I crucified my dreams to be on your side
To see you alive, to see you alive
