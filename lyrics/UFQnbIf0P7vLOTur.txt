And I don't know where to go
It's over now
You keep me running back for more
You keep me burning at the foot of your door
And I don't know where to go
It's over now
You keep me running back for more
You keep me burning at the foot of your door

I never had a problem
With how the feeling of a broken face
I could be a friend for all you know
And we're living in a hopeless place
But if it takes some time
To rid me of my whiskey and wine
I hope that I don't find my sight
When I'm blinded by you

And I don't know where to go
It's over now
You keep me running back for more
You keep me burning at the foot of your door
And I don't know where to go
It's over now
You keep me running back for more
You keep me burning at the foot of your door

Can you feel me
Burning baby?
I don't use my mouth
Wading motion
Burning ocean
I wanna sit on the rock for someone new

And I don't know where to go
It's over now (it's over now)
You keep me running back for more
You keep me burning at the foot of your door
And I don't know where to go
It's over now (it's over now)
You keep me running back for more
You keep me burning at the foot of your door

And I don't know where to go
And I don't know where to go
And I don't know where to go
And I don't know where to go
