Here we lie
In paradise
Your beauty holds all the dark away
Our phones have died
Just like the light
But we're alive 'long as we can stay
It's getting close
The rising smoke
I gotta know
Will you be here all the way?

You got that devil on your shoulder
Saying "turn your back"
You got cold feet and now's your moment
I understand

It's gonna get heavy
They're gonna be with me
Be ready
You can't close your eyes when it comes
The bad might be breaking
But that's where we're laying
Be all in
Holding me tight when it comes
(Be ready, be ready)
When it comes
(Be ready, be ready)

Catastrophe
Or ecstacy
What happens next, we don't get to choose
By my side
Before we die
You decide what you're gonna do

You got that devil on your shoulder
Saying "turn your back"
You got cold feet and now's your moment
I understand

It's gonna get heavy
They're gonna be with me
Be ready
You can't close your eyes when it comes
The bad might be breaking
But that's where we're laying
Be all in
Holding me tight when it comes
(Be ready, be ready)
When it comes
(Be ready, be ready)

Breathin' me in
I'm touchin' your skin
If this is the end
Breathin' me in
I'm touchin' your skin
If this is the end
Breathin' me in
I'm touchin' your skin
If this is the end
Breathin' me in
I'm touchin' your skin
If this is the end

Breathin' me in (it's gonna get heavy)
I'm touchin' your skin (they're gonna be with me)
If this is the end (be ready)
You can't close your eyes when it comes
Breathin' me in (the bad might be breaking)
I'm touchin' your skin (but that's where we're laying)
If this is the end (be all in)
Holding me tight when it comes
Breathin' me in
I'm touchin' your skin
If this is the end
Holding me tight when it comes
Breathin' me in
I'm touchin' your skin
If this is the end
Holding me tight when it comes
