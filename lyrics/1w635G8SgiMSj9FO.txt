Close your eyes
Open wide
Stop and clear your mind

Feel the crowd
Move in time
Surrender to the sound

Get lost inside your mind

(Let this broke shit, let this broke shit)
(Let this broke shit, let this broke shit)
(Let this broke shit, let this broke shit)
(Let this broke shit)

Flashing lights
Shine so bright
You fall into a trance

All the tracks
Take you back
Makes you feel alive

Get lost inside your mind

(Shit it!)

(So that's how it goes)
(Thank you so much)
(I need to get)
(And I need to know, ha ha)
(I don't know where any of you are suffering in this world)
