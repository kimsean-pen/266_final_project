Another day since I saw you last
Time I've spent alone
I keep digging up the past
Cameos of us

Send me pictures from the lake
I assume that it's
'Cause I'm dreaming of summer days
And winter's dragging on

Still miles apart again
Still miles apart again

Start a conversation, keeping her up
A quiet voice and I think you're close again
Start a conversation, keeping her up
A quiet voice and I think you're close again

Now that the days are getting dark
Even in the afternoon
And there's no easy fix
To sort it out

Another night since I saw you last
The days spent by the phone
And we can't change the past
Just let it go

Still miles apart again
Still miles apart again
Still miles apart again
Still miles apart again

Start a conversation, keeping her up
A quiet voice and I think you're close again
Start a conversation, keeping her up
A quiet voice and I think you're close again
You're close again
A quiet voice and I think you're close again
You're close again
A quiet voice and I think you're close
