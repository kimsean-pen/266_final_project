Passion burns with a fiery vengeance
We are the eye of the storm
An equivocal static destruction
Bleeding out false idol swarms
Possession and lacking in foresight
Bathing in your vanity
A force fed, misled, tainted image
Choking on depravity

By design, I despise
The kingdom will divide
Evolution disillusioned
Apawn in kings disguise

Over the edge
I want to believe
I want to preserve this legacy
Do you mean what you say
In the art you create?
You're digging your grave
My helpless enemy

Insincere, corrosive incarnates
Fallacy in empty lines
A prophet in personal fortune corrupting all receptive minds

This gallant flirtation
No reverence though we were born together
Fraudulent, you remiss
To fragile to exist contaminate, eradicate
Disciples of this gift

Over the edge
I want to believe
I want to preserve this legacy
Do you mean what you say
In the art you create?
You're digging your grave,
My helpless enemy

The rain will wash away the blood
And all the gears will start to rust
In vain you destroy all I've loved
For them I sing this threnody

Tie the noose
Tie the noose
Repeat the cycle
Born a stray
You are unnatural
You are a slave

BLEH!

You know nothing of anger
You know nothing of pain
You know not how the path
That you walk on was paved
Now you bask in your pity
From the wrath of shame
For too long you have lived
With your facade unscathed

Over the edge
I want to believe
I want to preserve this legacy
Do you mean what you say
In the art you create?
You're digging your grave,
My helpless enemy

The rain will wash away the blood
(away the blood)
And all the gears will start to rust
(start to rust)
In vain you destroy all I've loved
For them I sing this threnody

Carry the torch
We will carry the torch, ignite the world
I rest my faith in flames
