Ain't no sunshine when she gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
Wonder this time where he's gone
Wonder if he's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
This house just ain't no home
Anytime he goes away
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I think I should leave the young thing alone
'Cause ain't no sunshine when she gone
Ain't no sunshine when she gone
Only darkness everyday
Ain't no sunshine when she gone
This house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime he goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
