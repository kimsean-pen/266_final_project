Well she's kinda pretty, drives a big car too
And when I hold her in my arms, I never know what to do
She's got everything she needs, what does she need me for
Just a crazy fool comin' back for more

And I know she's no good
Can't blame her but I know I should
Everybody says a watch out boy
She'll break your heart like it was a toy

You better save it for a rainy day
You better save it for a rainy day

Well I'd leave in a minute if I only could
But when she touches me, it makes me feel so good
My heart's in her hand this is sure a mess
There's no way I say no, when she says yes, yes, yes

Take me, shake me
And tell me this ain't a dream
Everybody says a watch out boy
She'll break your heart like it was a toy

You better save it for a rainy day
You better save it for a rainy day

Save it for a rainy day
You better save it for a rainy day

You better save it, save it for a rainy day
You better save it, save it for a rainy day
You better save it, save it for a rainy day
You better save it, save it for a rainy day

You better save it, save it for a rainy day
You better save it, save it for a rainy day
You better save it, save it for a rainy day
You better save it, save it
