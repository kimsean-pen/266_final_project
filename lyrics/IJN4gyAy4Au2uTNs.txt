maggots feast, eternal whisper
eating through your soul
in your head their bodies glisten
the stench of death is foul
riot inside you
swarming around and through
crucified
a trail of insects down your spine
vermin inside you
control you
devour you
funeral
my sickening mind made you dissolve
vermin inside you
they move you
devour you

poisonous, vile obedience
to rotting deadened art
made me let this death-inferno
rip my soul apart
your skin is turning blue
i kill myself through you
i trap myself in blasphemous torture
mind decaying fast
in hyper-death a carnal fortune
and deadly shadows cast
all the rotting flesh
turned into a mesh

their mastication
violent invasion of my mind
emptiness takes over
pleasure's gone, insanity i find

memories choke me
chloroform drenched anxiety
corpses provoke me
no more killing variety
pestering forgery
i'm gone beyond all help
dehydrated mind
i'm swallowing insects myself
