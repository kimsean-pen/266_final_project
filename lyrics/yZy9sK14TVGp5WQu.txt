Fail us down we'll fall
Spin your web tight
So you could end it all
Or shine so bright
Do you miss me?
Will we always be wrong?
Am I just a memory
Who plays along?
Happy sad it makes me mad
I knew when you cried
What happened tonight
Tomorrow you'd hide
Forget me cause I won't forget you
Or the things you said today and maybe didn't mean.
