I've got my mother's eyes
If you can bear to look past the sleep lines
Safe to say I'm not my father's son
I've never felt that way about anyone

Two bricks in a broken home
Held together by sticks and stones
It's true what they say, you reap what you sow
The best part of me died seven years ago

Torn and frayed, we sewed no stitches
Made no peace, mended no bridges
So will you carry me?
Will you carry me?

Still want to ask my father with tears in my eyes
Where do we go when we die?
Still want to sleep on the floor
In the dead of the night by my mother's bedside
And though you ceased to love me
And I have long stopped loving you
It's always unconditional
Only as strong as the hell I put you through

Torn and frayed, we sewed no stitches
Made no peace, mended no bridges
So will you carry me?
Will you carry me?

And that's the truth
The worst in me is the worst in you
And that's the truth
The worst in me is the worst in you

And that's the truth
The worst in me is the worst in you
And that's the truth
The worst in me is the worst in you

Torn and frayed, we sewed no stitches
Made no peace, mended no bridges
So will you carry me?
Will you carry me?

And that's the truth
The worst in me is the worst in you
And that's the truth
The worst in me is the worst in you
