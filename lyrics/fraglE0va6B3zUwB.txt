How Can I Just Let You Walk Away
Just Let You Leave Without a Trace?
When I Stand Here Taking Every Breath With You, Ooh Ooh
You're the Only One Who Really Knew Me at All

How Can You Just Walk Away From Me
When All I Can Do Is Watch You Leave?
'cause We've Shared the Laughter and the Pain
And Even Shared the Tears
You're the Only One Who Really Knew Me at All

So Take a Look at Me Now
Well There's Just an Empty Space
And There's Nothing Left Here to Remind Me
Just the Memory of Your Face
Ooh, Take a Look at Me Now
Well There's Just an Empty Space
And You Coming Back to Me Is Against the Odds
And That's What I've Got to Face, Sponsored Links

I Wish I Could Just Make You Turn Around
Turn Around and See Me Cry
There's So Much I Need to Say to You
So Many Reasons Why
You're the Only One Who Really Knew Me at All

So Take a Look at Me Now
Well There's Just an Empty Space
And There's Nothing Left Here to Remind Me
Just the Memory of Your Face

Now Take a Look at Me Now
'cause That's Just an Empty Space
But to Wait for You Is All I Can Do
And That's What I've Got to Face
Take a Good Look at Me Now
'cause I'll Still Be Standing Here
And You Coming Back to Me Is Against All Odds
It's the Chance I've Got to Take
Take a Look at Me Now
