I walk along the city streets you used to walk along with me
And every step I take reminds me of just how we used to be

Well how can I forget you girl,
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me.

As shadows fall I pass the small cafe where we would dance at night.
And I can't help recalling how it
how it felt to kiss and hold you tight.

Well how can I forget you girl
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me.
I was born to love her and I will never be free,
You'll always be a part of me.

If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share
Just come back to the places where we used to go and I'll be there.

Well, how can I forget you girl
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me.
I was born to love her and I will never be free,
You'll always be a part of me.

Cause there is always something there to remind me.
Always something there to remind me...
