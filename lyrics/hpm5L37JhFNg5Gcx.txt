She can hold onto her own
If it comes to push and shove
She has kept a lookout on
Over what's left of their love

And he keeps himself held back
For both their peace of minds
But he's no less quick to know
To begrudge of what he finds

Ooh, see I should soon
Ooh, ooh, see I should soon

As they watch themselves grow old
As he helps her into bed
Just a hint of it survives
Just this talk inside his head

Ohh, I can't tell
How much all they seemed gay
And something in the way she tells me
I wish that I been gone

Ooh, see I should soon
Ooh, see I should soon
Ooh, see I should soon
