You have to learn to pace yourself
(Pressure)
You're just like everybody else
(Pressure)

You've only had to run so far, so good
But you will come to a place
Where the only thing you feel
Are loaded guns in your face
And you'll have to deal with pressure

You used to call me paranoid
(Pressure)
But even you cannot avoid
(Pressure)

You turn the tap-dance into your crusade
Now here you are with your faith
And your Peter Pan advice
You have no scars on your face
And you cannot handle the pressure

All grown up and no place to go
Psych one, psych two
What do you know?
All your life is Channel 13
Sesame Street
What does it mean?

I'll tell you what it means
Pressure

Don't ask for help, you're all alone
(Pressure)
You'll have to answer to your own
(Pressure)

I'm sure you have some cosmic rationale
Now here you are, in the ninth
Two men out and three men on
Nowhere to look, but inside
Where we all respond to pressure

Pressure

All your life is Time Magazine
I read it too.
What does it mean?

PRESSURE!

I'm sure you have some cosmic rationale
But here you are with your faith
And your Peter Pan advice
You have no scars on your face
And you cannot handle pressure

The pressure
Pressure
1, 2, 3, 4 Pressure!
