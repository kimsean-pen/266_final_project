Standing on glass sheets
It hit like a cold one
Feeling our way out
We left all the old ones
Followed by treason
We left there believing we're fine

Undid our bracelets,
Gleaming and faceless
Wasted, you're beaming
You'll give every reason
Slurring your words
You would leave me outside

Oh I would wait up for you
Oh I would wait up for you

Tore at the ceiling
When I would stop breathing
Trained well and seasoned
Your hand left my mouth shut
Undid my learning by speaking too loud
Tell me how
When I grow older I'll know not to speak out

Oh I would wait up for you
Oh I would wait up for you
Oh I would wait up for you

Oh I would wait up for you
Oh I would wait up for you
Oh I would wait up for you

You and I left this home for a reason
You and I left this home for a reason
You and I left this home for a reason
You and I, you and I, you and I
