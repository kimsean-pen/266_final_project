Mama, I don't have time for dancing
That's just gonna have to wait a while
Ain't got time for messing around
And it's not my style

This whole town can slow you down
People taking the easy way
But I know exactly where I'm going
And getting closer, closer, everyday

And I'm almost there, I'm almost there
People down here think I'm crazy but I don't care
Trials and tribulations have had my share
There ain't nothing gonna stop me now 'cause I'm almost there

I remember Daddy told me, fairy tales can come true
You gotta make 'em happen, it all depends on you
So I work real hard each and everyday
Now things for sure are going my way

Just doing what I do
Look out boys I'm coming through

And I'm almost there, I'm almost there
People gonna come here from everywhere
And I'm almost there, I'm almost there

There's been trials and tribulations
You know I've had my share
But I've climbed the mountain, I've crossed the river
And I'm almost there, I'm almost there, I'm almost there
