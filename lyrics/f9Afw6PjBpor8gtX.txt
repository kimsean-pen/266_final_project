I used to live alone, but I found you, so certain
I'm yours to take
Now I can't wait for all the mistakes
We've yet to make

Now shake it up, baby, twist and shout
We're war-torn buildings, all bombed out

Love, not unlike
I got drunk, pissin' the night away
Love, not unlike

Won't you come over and love me?
Won't you come over again?
Can you overcome the unnerving
Ossifying body you're in?

I used to live alone just counting the pretty little flowers on my dress
I can't wait to consecrate this wondrous mess

Words unforgotten 'til we sing again
Start at the bottom, and then we descend

Love, not unlike
Little joy in/around no more
Love, not unlike
I am woman, hear me roar
Love, not unlike
Larry Lemon, sanctified
Love, not unlike

Won't you come over and love me?
Won't you come over again?
Help me overcome the unnerving
Ossifying body I'm in

I ask all the time
But you never tell me
What have I got to do, to make that man want me?

What have I got to do (Lovin you is makin it easy)
To make that man love me (Lovin you is makin it up)
What have I got to do (Lovin you is makin it easy)
To make that man want me? (Lovin you is makin it up)
What have I got to do (Lovin you is makin it easy)
To make that man love me (Lovin you is makin it up)
What have I got to do?
