If you look into the mirror thinking you're not good enough
And if all your friends look pretty but you're still the ugly duck
If you cry yourself to sleep every night
Remember that I think you're perfect just the way you are

From the tips of your toes to the depth of your soul
If you could see yourself through my eyes
You'd see you're perfect just like that

I think you're beautiful inside and out
Don't ever doubt that you are beautiful inside and out
Believe me when I say you are

I know exactly how it feels, been there a thousand times myself
Always looked into the mirror wishing I was someone else
All the time we waste on trying to change
Why don't we put all those hours on learning to love ourselves

From the tips of your toes to the depth of your soul
If you could see yourself through my eyes
You'd see you're perfect just like that

I think you're beautiful inside and out
Don't ever doubt that you are beautiful inside and out
Believe me when I say that you're beautiful

(Don't you know, don't you know you're beautiful)
(Don't you know, don't you know you're beautiful)
(Don't you know, don't you know you're beautiful)
Say that you're beautiful
(Don't you know, don't you know you're beautiful)
(Don't you know, don't you know) Inside and out
Believe me when I say you are (beautiful, beautiful)

I think you're beautiful inside and out
Don't ever doubt that you are beautiful inside and out
Believe me when I, believe me when I say
(Don't you know, don't you know you're beautiful)
(Don't you know, don't you know you're beautiful)
(Don't you know, don't you know you're beautiful)
Say that you're beautiful
(Don't you know, don't you know you're beautiful)
(Don't you know, don't you know you're beautiful)
(Don't you know, don't you know you're beautiful)
I think you're beautiful
