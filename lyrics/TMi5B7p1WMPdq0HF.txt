I've been a lot of things are going me
You figure it out even though you've a pain to know why
I know it's been we're both too old to leave
But I'd rather be fighting than sleeping alone
That's the thing if you think about us Holding on to you
Gotta leave when you need to find her
I've gotta get away
I always knew that love was what you wanted
I've gotta get away
The way you look I think that I might want it
I've gotta get away
It's time to face you don't belong to me
You fear the end but you know that I'm playing the long game
I try to take the time you love to keep
'cause I'd rather be fighting than sleeping alone
That's the thing if you think about us Holding on to you
Gotta leave when you need to find her
I've gotta get away
I always knew that love was what you wanted
I've gotta get away
The way you look I think that I might want it
I've gotta get away
I've gotta get away
I've gotta get away
Yeah
Lying here with you while I'm reminded

I always knew that love was what you wanted
I've gotta get away
I've gotta get away
I've gotta get away
