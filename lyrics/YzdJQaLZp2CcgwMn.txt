I don't need this now, don't need this now, don't need this now
Not from you. Not from you. Not from you. Not from you.
I don't need this now, don't need this now, don't need this now
Not from you. Not from you. Not from you. Not from you
I don't need this now, don't need this now, don't need this now
Not from you. Not from you. Not from you. Not from you
I don't need this now, don't need this now, don't need this now
Not from you. Not from you. Not from you. Not from you
I'm lying to myself!
When I'm laying next to you
I'm making love to myself
When I'm making love to you
I can hear you grind your teeth
When you're laying fast asleep
I think I'm the one I need
I think I'm the one I need
Being happy with you or be bad alone
Being happy with you or be bad alone
I just need myself, just need myself, just need myself
To love myself. To love myself. To love myself. To love myself.
I just need myself, just need myself, just need myself
To love myself. To love myself. To love myself. To love myself.
Can we stop watching the tv
Can I get up off of my knees
and find a rhythm of my own
and find a reason to leave home
Being happy with with you or be bad alone
Being happy with you or be bad alone
I just need myself, just need myself, just need myself
To love myself. To love myself. To love myself. To love myself
I just need myself, just need myself, just need myself
To love myself. To love myself. To love myself. To love myself.
