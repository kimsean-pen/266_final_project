She's calling you.
Floating up the street synthetic sounds are sweet.
To everyman I meet, this is how I greet.
Did you get that call? Or were you not at home?
Little chance you'll miss. Just steady on your phone.
I know you're glad. Wisdom's not sad.
She's calling you...
Vibrating cosmic waves, spirit electricity.
Kaleidoscopic treat. In the endless sea.
Is there one for all. Inseparable to no other.
One voluntary kiss keeps contemplating home.
I know you're glad.
She's calling you.
She's calling.
