You took my heart from the dark
I'm falling hard
With you it's like you kill the shade
My burning pain

I feel like something starting, staring
Playing in my head
And it's beating loud
I feel like something starting, starting
Walking on the edge
'Til we're crashing down

Hit me so hard I don't know where
Starstruck up in the air
Got me got me with my eyes wide open
Hit me so hard I don't know where
Starstruck up in the air
Got me got me with my eyes wide open

If you tell me no I'm Not Giving Up no
If you tell me no I'm Not Giving Up no
Never giving up
Not Giving Up on love, oh, oh, oh
If you tell me no I'm Not Giving Up no
If you tell me no I'm Not Giving Up no
Never giving up
Not Giving Up on love, oh, oh, oh

You're under my skin
Just stay right there
I want you there
Let the rest fade away
It's just you and me
What was meant to be

I feel like something starting, starting
Playing in my head
And it's beating loud
I feel like something starting, starting
Walking on the edge
'Til we're crashing down

Hit me so hard I don't know where
Starstruck up in the air
Got me got me with my eyes wide open
Hit me so hard I don't know where
Starstruck up in the air
Got me got me with my eyes wide open

If you tell me no I'm Not Giving Up no
If you tell me no I'm Not Giving Up no
Never giving up
Not Giving Up on love, oh, oh, oh
If you tell me no I'm Not Giving Up no
If you tell me no I'm Not Giving Up no
Never giving up
Not Giving Up on love, oh, oh, oh

Got me on overload
I'll be your rock of gold
Can we get overdose on love, oh, oh, oh
Got me on overload
I'll be your rock of gold
Can we get overdose on love

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Hit me so hard I don't know where
Starstruck up in the air
Got me got me with my eyes wide open
Hit me so hard I don't know where
Starstruck up in the air
Got me got me with my eyes wide open

If you tell me no I'm Not Giving Up no
If you tell me no I'm Not Giving Up no
Never giving up
Not Giving Up on love, oh, oh, oh
If you tell me no I'm Not Giving Up no
If you tell me no I'm Not Giving Up no
Never giving up
Not Giving Up on love, oh, oh
