Sunlight was the only thing that felt right
Before I came here
But inside, it feels like it keeps raining
And every drop is like the tears we could cry

'Cause this time we were all alone
But this place gave us something
And somehow made us strong

If there's a place inside this world
Where hopes and dreams are not yet lost
We'll stand and climb against these walls
And fight this fight forever more

Sometimes I feel this anger changing, slowly into
A monster that keeps on creeping under
And I don't think that I can take anymore
I need to kill like never before
But can you hear me call?

If there's a place inside this world
Where hopes and dreams are not yet lost
We'll stand and climb against these walls
And fight this fight forever more
If there's a place inside this world
Where we must go back to once more
Until the day
We find that place
We're not alone

When things go bad, when things go wrong
When on the verge of letting go
There's something that I really want you to know

When things go bad, when things go wrong
When on the verge of letting go
There's something that I really want you to know

You are not alone
No, you're not alone anymore
You are not alone, no you're not alone anymore!

If there's a place inside this world
Where hopes and dreams are not yet lost
We'll stand and climb against these walls
And fight this fight forever more
If there's a place inside this world
Where we must go back to once more
Until the day
We find that place
We're not alone

We're not alone
When things go bad, when things go wrong
When on the verge of letting go
There's something that I really want you to know
