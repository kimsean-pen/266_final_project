Taser, taser, kindergarten nap, nap time
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Highchair crumbles unannounced
Like a draft from outside
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Beacon shined a light from the faulty tower
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Colossal in tons, unknowing it wants
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Atop this podium built of fixation
(They like to choke)
All utensils are fixed on you

Cranes perched in scows, in the windows they would peek
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Snuck inside the sound of sleep
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
don't sweat the hemorrhaging gland
don't sweat the hemorrhaging gland
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Feast upon your illness
And let the puppet strings sag
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Atop this podium built of fixation
(They like to choke)
All utensils are fixed on you
(They like it)
Atop this podium split the confession
Dripping with drool from the nerves

Lazarus threw the party
Lazarus threw the fight
Lazarus threw the party
Lazarus threw the fight
Snuck inside the sound of sleep
Snuck inside the sound of sleep
Lazarus threw the party
Lazarus threw the fight

Cloak a dagger plot
Her sovereign majesty
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Bullet ridden with vermin
Be it the peasant stark frenzy
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Held onto its tusks, naked and disrobed
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
And the emperor still wears no clothes
Pacifier pacifies, yeah it pacifies
Atop this podium built of fixation
(They like to choke)
All utensils are fixed on you
(They like it)
Atop this podium split the confession
(They like it)
