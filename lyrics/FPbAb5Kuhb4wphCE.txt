A little ditty about Jack and Diane
Two American kids growin' up in the heartland
Jackie gonna be a football star
Diane's a debutante, backseat of Jackie's car

Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee-Freez
Diane's sittin' on Jackie's lap
He's got his hands between her knees
Jackie say, hey Diane, let's run off behind the shady trees
Dribble off those Bobbie Brooks, let me do what I please
And say uh

Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone, they say uh
Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone, they walk on

Jackie sits back, collects his thoughts for the moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean
Well then there Diane, we oughta run off to the city
Diane says, baby, you ain't missin' nothing
And Jackie say uh

Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah, they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

So let it rock
Let it roll
Let the Bible Belt come and save my soul
Hold on to sixteen as long as you can
Changes come around real soon
Make us women and men

Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah, they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

A little ditty 'bout Jack and Diane
Two American kids doin' the best they can
