Olhos verdes e boca cheia de vida
100 imagens feitas sobre sua camisa
Não contei minha história eu perdi a memória
De tudo o que passei
Fuja logo comigo e confie no vento que se foi

And you keep coming home
Cuz I'm running over my time
And you see that you're not far away
But you clearly

Don't make up your mind
So keep on moving on
keep on driving me home
And keep on moving on
Keep on driving me home
And I complain that you're not here
But you cant't hide
From moments of fear
And you're not there so I pretend
You're an image from my head
And you say
And you say

Recolhendo os pedaços do vaso da vida
Não precisa gritar meu desejo é te amar sem ter fim
Fotogramas de instantes
que foram importantes no mundo de nós dois
Fuja logo sozinho e confie no vento que se foi

And you keep coming home cuz
I'm running over my time
And you see that you're not far away
But you clearly

So keep on moving on
Keep on driving me home
And keep on moving on
Keep on driving me home
And I complain that you're not here
But you cant't hide
From moments of fear
And you're not there so I pretend
You're an image from my head
And you say
And you say

Clearly give it up
Give it up
Give it up to the sky

But you clearly
Give it up
Give it up to the sky

Clearly give it up
Give it up
Give it up to the sky

But you clearly
Give it so...

So keep on moving on
Keep on driving me home
And keep on moving on
Keep on driving me home
And I complain that you're not here
But you cant't hide
From moments of fear
And you're not there so I pretend
You're an image from my head
And you say
é você
é você
é você
é você
