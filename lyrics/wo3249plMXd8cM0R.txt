I'm on the battlefield, like, oh my God (Oh la la)
Knockin' soldiers down like House of Cards (Oh la la)
I'm a one woman army (oh la la)
Yes, I'm a one woman army
(Oh la la, oh la la, oh la la)

I pull up in a matte black supa car
Like Whitney, yeah, no body guard
Stylin' on 'em, gettin' him hard
I got it, I bring all the boys to the yard
You see me at the club in Hollywood
You know I bring that Detroit hood
You like it, and u feelin' good
You know that you want it
You know that you would

Let's march tonight
The music is still playin'
So get and up fight
You know that you want it
You know that you would

I'm on the battlefield, like, oh my God (Oh la la)
Knockin' soldiers down like House of Cards (Oh la la)
I'm a one woman army (Oh la la)
Yes, I'm a one woman army
(Oh la la, oh la la, oh la la)

I'm on the battlefield, like, oh my God (Oh la la)
Knockin' soldiers down like House of Cards (Oh la la)
I'm a one woman army (Oh la la)
Yes, I'm a one woman army
(Oh la la, oh la la, oh la la)

I hit cha with that kung-fu Jackie Chan
Boom, boom, boom, pow, I'm super fast
High heels, big deal, I'll kick your ass
They gunnin', they runnin' and that makes me mad
If you wanna rumble all you gotta do is ask
I'm a rude bitch, boy can you handle that?
I love to play but I don't really need a man
No daddy, no VISA, I got my own cash

Let's march tonight
The music is still playin'
So get up and fight
No daddy, no VISA, I got my own cash

I'm on the battlefield, like, oh my God (Oh la la)
Knockin' soldiers down like House of Cards (Oh la la)
I'm a one woman army (Oh la la)
Yes, I'm a one woman army
(Oh la la, oh la la, oh la la)

I'm on the battlefield, like, oh my God (Oh la la)
Knockin' soldiers down like House of Cards (Oh la la)
I'm a one woman army (Oh la la)
Yes, I'm a one woman army
(Oh la la, oh la la, oh la la)

One, two, three, hut
March if you don't give a fuck
One, two, three, hut
(Oh la la, oh la la)
One, two, three, hut
March if you don't give a fuck
One, two, three, hut
(Oh la la, oh la la)

I'm on the battlefield, like, oh my God (Oh la la)
Knockin' soldiers down like House of Cards (Oh la la)
I'm a one woman army (Oh la la)
Yes, I'm a one woman army
(Oh la la, oh la la, oh la la)

I'm on the battlefield, like, oh my God (Oh la la)
Knockin' soldiers down like House of Cards (Oh la la)
I'm a one woman army (Oh la la)
Yes, I'm a one woman army
