Aye Mrs. Hubert
You think that they should hang with us
Can't feel my music we used to dance so Thelonious
Monk from my monastery
Carried my bags out the door
Lit that shit with a big
Hit a jig
Threw the ash with the cash in a knapsack

Used to love me
I used to love you
We had the phones
(Goddamn)
We had the phones
But d-d-did you love me
Like I loved you

Wonder if you'll dismiss me
Maybe light-skin Aunt Viv me
Decadent executive
Make sure no nigga never miss me
No, once I go into the darkness
His darkest darkness

Wonder if you'll dismiss me
Maybe light-skin Aunt Viv me
Decadent executive
Make sure no nigga never miss me
No, once I go into the darkness
His darkest darkness

Hey listen Janet
Cool if I call you Janet?
Been hanging on this branch in the canopy out in Canada
Man just mangled my manager
Text say I'm boutta, vanish
What we doing this weekend was thinking it's time to dance, dance

Used to love me
I used to love you
We had the phones
(Goddamn)
We had the phones
But d-d-did you love me
Like I loved you

Wonder if you'll dismiss me
Maybe light-skin Aunt Viv me
Decadent executive
Make sure no nigga never miss me
No, once I go into the darkness
His darkest darkness

Wonder if you'll dismiss me
Maybe light-skin Aunt Viv me
Decadent executive
Make sure no nigga never miss me
No, once I go into the darkness
His darkest darkness

Said I wonder
Said I wonder
Said I wonder
Said I wonder
Why I want love
I just want love
Said I wonder
Said I wonder
Said I wonder
Why I want love
I just want love
Said I wonder
Said I wonder
Said I wonder
I just want love
