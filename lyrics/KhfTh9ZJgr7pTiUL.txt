1, 2, 3, 4
Days dedicated to the thought of being through
And I just want to lay in bed with you
And admit that I'm so tired of everything I do
But, with you, but, with you
It was new
And I can't stop thinking of the moon
In the nights, I saw your breath in the room
So, draw a line within the snow
Between what you thought and what you know
And, in that space, build a hole in the way
If this fire goes out, I will keep you warm
The best I can
I threw everything I have into the flames just to make it last
