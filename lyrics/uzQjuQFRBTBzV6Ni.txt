Like a lamb to its slaughter
Buried in water
...
Down
Under the ground
There's a town there
I've been down there
In the middle of the lake
I hold your hand, for goodness' sake

When the women and kids are asleep
The wolves there in the skin of the sheep
So lock all the windows and doors
The Devil's coming for you and yours

Love was all that it could give
But it died so other towns could live
They don't bury bodies from the ground
But they drowned our little town

Like a lamb to its slaughter
Buried in water
Buried in water
Buried in water

When the leaves go floating away
In the pale moonlight of day
Bury anchors in our ghosts
And we can let our heartbeats go

Love was all that it could give
But it died so other towns could live
They don't bury bodies from the ground
But they drowned our little town

Love was all that it could give
But it died so other towns could live
They don't bury bodies from the ground
But they drowned our little town

We're like a lamb to its slaughter
Buried in water
Buried in water
Buried in water
