(Oaken rod system show me sloping earlobes)
(The patient unlisted bit my lip sir)
(Basing the feeling off weed, Go!)
(But my Achilles is a shortly written poem)

(Go loco, slow from dro, broke your nose)
(Scraping my bristle missile)
(Go loco, slow from dro, broke your nose)
(Scraping my bristle missile, Go!)

My cost is cheap
My words are deep
Cutting right through your soul
It's sad to see the lights burn out
It's sad to see the lights burn out
Sad to see burn away, my words unchanged

(Another sucker punch)
(You were late for dinner, I was late for lunch)
(You wanna know the truth?)
(I eat a lotta soup)
(What's it like to punch a drum?)
(So belong and hold it tightly son)
(You wanna know the truth?)
(I eat a lotta soup)

Oh, no

(Such slow stoic teeth of mine)
(Box him in, uncle Leo is between your thighs)
(You're soakin' rusting these slope driven pots 'n pans)
(No time to rush him, delete my deleted land)
(Yo, who proves to me, to believe what you need without me?)
(Who proves to believe in me?)
(Yo, who proves to believe without me?)
(Don't believe that you're with me, just to believe)
(Just to and just to and just to and just to believe)

Blow up your lungs
Let your mouth fill with blood
Stop! Hang on my every word
Because I promise I'm coming back

(I blocked your three point shot, you get caught napping a lot)
(Your handles worse than Chris A, when he's high on pot)
(You're like an epileptic version of a ballet dancer)
(KG might say that you have cancer)

Blow up your lungs
Let your mouth fill with blood
Stop! Hang on my every word
Because I promise I'm coming back

Blow up your lungs
Let your mouth fill with blood
Stop! Hang on my every word
Because I promise it's gonna be your last
