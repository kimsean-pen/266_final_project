I'm fit and working again
Look down the road
In the sun
I [make a pact with forty strong gang]
I'm fit and working again
I've seen fit
We've seen the tail end
I'm fit and working again
I used to hang like chandeliers
My lungs are crusted in blood
But the facts is now cut clear
I'm fit and working, dear
still continue to write this song
I'm fit and working again
I used to think this spot was the domain
Opinion is at most
Stimulus reason
If you've got the most
With true, precise
Analysis is academic
Some thoughts can get nauseous.
Set opposite a freak on a train
Warts on his head and chin
Boy, was I getting so vain
I saw the recession around Victoria Station
I'm fit and working again
Gimme the sun.
I'm fit and working again
And I feel like Alan Minter*
I just ate eight sheets of blotting paper
And I tripped out on the Alka Seltzer
Cause I'm fit and working again...
Don't you know that was the tail end.
