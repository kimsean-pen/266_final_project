You, you and I
Yeah, start the day
We're out the door
We go to war
Protect an idea
One that can't even feed the poor
Yeah, run away
Fast as you can
How quick can people hope to be?
Here comes the sea
To take all you have
Soon you'll be swimming in the deep

You, you and I
Up outta bed without a care
We go to war
To protect an ideal
One that can't even heal the land
Yeah, run away
Fast as you can
How quick can people hope to be?
Here comes the Sun
To burn all you have

Lift all your ashes through the trees

You, you and I
Into the car on down the road
We cruise around
The motions profound
The natural state, the modern mode
Yeah, drive away
Fast as you can
How quick can robots hope to be?
Here comes the new

To bury the old
Which fate will I live to see?

I'm alive
But life is a dream
Will I wake before I die?
I feel my bones and I feel my skin
Time flies, it will pass you by
Yeah, run away
Fast as you can
How quick can people hope to be?
Here comes the sea
To take all you have
Soon you'll be sinking in the deep
