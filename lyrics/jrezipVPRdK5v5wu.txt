Congratulations for making this world a stage
As the curtain falls our lives will vanish in applause
Let this horrid scene be a one that lasts forever
Lasts forever

Triumph has its many faces
Theres only one that will decide
Triumph has its many faces
Theres only one that is divine

We can try and escape
The fate has us by the throat
I have never doubted death, never doubted death
Look to the sky
Say your fucking prayers

Devour what you thought was life
A pathetic script written by our fathers
If only there was hope for our souls
We would be home again

And I've seen beyond these walls
Take me home
And I've seen beyond these walls
Take me home

I have opened my eyes,
there was nothing left for me

So what if it's all a lie
Where will we go from here
So what if it's all a lie
Where will we go from here

Beyond the dead
Beyond the dead
