Grew up in a town that is famous as the place of movie scenes
Noise was always loud, there are sirens all around, and the streets are mean
"If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere" â€“ that's what they say
Seeing my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on Broadway

Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York: Concrete jungle where dreams are made
Oh, there's nothing you can't do now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York!

On the Avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a meltin' pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge

I'm gon' make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York: concrete jungle where dreams are made
Oh, there's nothing you can't do now you're in New York
These street will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York!

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeaaah, yeaaaah

In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made
Oh, there's nothing you can't do now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Now you're in New York!
