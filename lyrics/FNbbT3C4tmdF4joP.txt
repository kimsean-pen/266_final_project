Tryna seek it
Tryna see it through
And I saw your face
So fast
We should do this again
I've bit my lip before, did it again before

I don't believe it
Don't overthink it
I won't believe it

I want out of this world
I will not go back, I get love, not enough
I want out of this world
I didn't like it anyway

I want out of this world
I will not go back, I get love, not enough
I want out of this world
I didn't want it anyway

We should do this again
I've bit my lip before, did it again before
I got a job, I got a job
Anything you ask of me, I'll be

I want out of this world
I will not go back, I get love, not enough
I want out of this world
I didn't want it anyway

One eye, catch my look and be my
Side eye, like a crook

I was at your house
But you never came
And I wanted you
All the lights I face are following

I want out of this world
I will love only what, I can love only what
I want out of this world
I didn't want it anyway

I want out of this world
I will not go back, I get love, not enough
I want out of this world
I didn't want it anyway
