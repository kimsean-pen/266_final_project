living with me
I don't think it would be so bad
this is the first time this year
that I'm not going to make you mad
I'm tired of my conscious
always telling me to stop sleeping in
but I can't waste a second
on dreams that will never begin

everyone has a head upon their shoulders
we're losing our pride as we all get older
everyone has to pick on their saviors
you might not get it right
or you might realize that its too late

don't back down
I'm over the past
can't you see
don't back down
I don't really care about before
you met me

is it cool if I see you tonight
there's a thousand questions
I want to ask you
if you think that its alright

everyone has a head upon their shoulders
we're losing our pride as we all get older
everyone has to pick on thier saviors
you might not get it right
or you might realize that its too late

don't back down
I'm over the past
can't you see
don't back down
I don't really care about before
you met me

so don't take anything for granted
stand outside in the rain
an excuse you know I planned it
every ending
ends up the same

don't back down
I'm over the past
can't you see
don't back down
I don't really care about before
you met me
