Well, the men come in these places, and the men are all the same;
You don't look at their faces, and you don't ask their names...
You don't think of them as human - you don't think of them at all;
You keep your mind on the money, keeping your eyes on the wall...

I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money, I'll do what you want me to do;
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money, and any ol' music will do...

I wanna make a million dollars; I wanna live out by the sea,
Have a husband and some children - yeah, I guess I want a family...
All the men come in these places, and the men are all the same;
You don't look at their faces, and you don't ask their name...

I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money, I'll do what you want me to do;
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money, and any ol' music will do...
I'm your private dancer, dancer for money, do what you want me to do;
Just a private dancer, a dancer for money, and any ol' music will do...

Deutschmarks or dollars? American Express will do nicely, thank you;
Let me loosen up your collar - Tell me, do you wanna see me do the shimmy again?
Oh...
Ah...

I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money, do what you want me to do;
I'm your private dancer, dancer for money, and any ol' music will do...

Well, the men come in these places, and the men are all the same;
You don't look at their faces, and you don't ask their name...
You don't think of them as human, ah, you don't think of them at all;
You keep your mind on the money, keeping your eyes on the wall...

I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money, I'll do what you want me to do;
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money, and any ol' music will do...
I'm your private dancer, dancer for money, I'll do what you want me to do;
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money, and any ol' music will do...

I'm your private dancer, dancer for money...
I'm your private dancer, dancer for money...
Ah, I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money...
Just a private dancer, dancer for money...
Oh...
