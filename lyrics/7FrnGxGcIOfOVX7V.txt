I clench my fist and break my chains
Destroy the mirror of tears
I force the night to smash you down
And lose my innocence (I'm)

Blinded by the fire of universe
I'm falling down, no reverse

I can't rewind my life to then
When I was dreaming of warmth
You took away the child I've been
And left me frozen and

Blinded by the fire of universe
I'm falling down, no reverse

Rewind rewind to then-

I'm an angel
Born from the breath of life
An Ikarus
Burning and falling down

Blinded by the fire of universe
I'm falling down, no reverse
Blinded by the fire of universe
I'm falling down

Rewind rewind there is no rewind
