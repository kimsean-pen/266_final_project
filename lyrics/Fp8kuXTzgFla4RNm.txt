Let's not apologise
Let's not assume blame
And if there's a whisper of dissent
Send it to the library

Oh honey, dearest
We're all panicking now
I'm minded to take it away
Oh honey, darling
Can we learn to take what's coming?
Resounding with take, take, take, take
Resounding with take, take, take, take
Resounding with take, take, take, take

Let's write a book
Let's paint the walls
And if that makes us forget where we are
We'll always be somewhere else
We'll always be somewhere else
We'll always be somewhere else

Oh honey
Oh darling

Resounding with take, take, take, take...
