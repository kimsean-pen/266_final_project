I see myself in your hazy eyes
Hands on my side, moves just like mine
I could feel you on my shoulder, I could die
I wanna steal your summer kiss
I want to stay here just like this
Everything is frozen in time

Nothing else matters anyway
So let's run away
Let's follow the stars and get lost in outer space
Why don't we run away?
Why don't we run away?
Why don't we run away?

I want to see you run beside
Me as I try, try to find
Somewhere in the darkness we can hide
Let me be your Mary Jane
Kiss upside down in the pouring rain
Don't ever want to leave your arms again

Nothing else matters anyway
So let's run away
Let's follow the stars and get lost in outer space
Why don't we run away?
To the place we know
Back to the place where the green grass goes
We don't care about the time, we can take it slow

What if we just want to dance tonight?
Just want to dance
Don't make any plans, just move to the neon lights
What if we want to dance?

Nothing else matters anyway
So let's run away
Let's follow the stars and get lost in outer space
Why don't we run away?
Why don't we run away?
Why don't we run away?

Why don't we run away?
Why don't we run away?
Why don't we run away?
