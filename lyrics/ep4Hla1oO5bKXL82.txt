Can we get together today?
Or are we more different than not?
I'm cold and you're hot
Are we just stuck in our ways?
Call my friend up, yeah tell me what you got

Oh, we're opposite stuff
We're sandals and socks
We're nerds and we're jocks
And we're better off together
We got to hang out, we got to hang out
We got to hang out
'Cause we're better off to-

We can work together for sure (Na na)
Even though you fly first class, and I'm at the back
You're hilarious, I'm a bore (Na na)
And the choir starts up
Yeah show me what you got

Oh, we're different things
We're MJ and Prince
We're concrete and bling
But we're better off together
We got to hang out, we got to hang out
We got to hang out
'Cause we're better

Hello me and you (Na na na na)
We're better as a two (Na na na na)
Even though we're different, we're the same
We've got to work it out before it drives us insane
Hello me and you (Na na na na)
(Na na na na)
(Na na na na)
Hello me and you (Na na na na)

We've got to start playing in time
Can there be a marriage of minds?
Can we be alike?
Can we turn water to wine?
Or is too much fuss?
Are you all that I'm not?

Oh, we're far apart
We're casual and smart
We're logic and art
And we're better off together
We got to hang out, we got to hang out
We got to hang out
'Cause we're better

Hello me and you (Na na na na)
We're better as a two (Na na na na)
Even though we're different, we're the same
So get into the rocket
'Cause we're going to space

Hello me and you (Na na na na)
Hello me and you (Na na na na)
Hello me and you (Na na na na)
Hello me and you
Hello me and you (Na na na na)
Hello me and you (Na na na na)
Over and out
