You keep on giving me the hold up
(Hold up)
You know I wish you'd make your mind up
(Mind up)
'Cuz when we get it on its so, so
(So, so)
You used to be my Romeo
(Hoo, hoo, yea, ooo)
'Cuz you see my dear I have had enough
Of keeping quiet about all this stuff
You're neurotic like a yo, yo
(Yo, yo)
You used to be my Romeo
(Hoo, hoo, yea, ooo)

'Cuz you left me laying there
With a broken heart
Staring through a deep cold void
Alone in the dark
And I miss the warmth in the morning
And the laughter when I can't stop yawning
But the tears on the pillow have dried my dear
Gona let it all go 'cuz I have no fear
(Hoo, hoo, yea, ooo)
Let it all go
(Hoo, hoo, yea, ooo)
Let it all go
(Hoo, hoo, yea, ooo)
Let it all go
(Hoo, hoo, yea, ooo)
Let it all go
