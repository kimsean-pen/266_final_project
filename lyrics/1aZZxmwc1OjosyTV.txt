B-U-T-T-E-R-F-L-Y

Glitter baby boy
He don't have a choice
I sparkle like toys
But he can't find a boy
Sparkle baby girl
She will have this world
Once her life was poor
Tip the cannon boy

Not a caterpillar anymore
You know I'm her
B-U-T-T-E-R
F-L-Y, I got an alibi
B-U-T-T-E-R
F-L-Y, I got an alibi
B-U-T-T-E-R
F-L-Y, I got an alibi
B-U-T-T-E-R
F-L-Y, I got an alibi

She's misunderstood
Grew up in the hood
Was a little bird brain
Now she's fucking insane
Shallow men come first
To see her colors burst
Dancing on the table tops
Does what she wants and won't stop

Fuck
Fuck

Look what came to be
A butterfly you call me crazy on my knees
Fuck you expect from me
Trying to catch me on a flower
Trying to clip my wings

B-U-T-T-E-R
F-L-Y, I got an alibi
B-U-T-T-E-R
F-L-Y, I got an alibi
B-U-T-T-E-R
F-L-Y, I got an alibi
B-U-T-T-E-R
F-F-F-F-F fuck
B-U-T-T-E-R
F-L-Y, I got an alibi
B-U-T-T-E-R
F-L-Y, I got an alibi
Alibi, alibi
F-L-Y, I got an alibi
Alibi, alibi
F-L-Y, I got an alibi
