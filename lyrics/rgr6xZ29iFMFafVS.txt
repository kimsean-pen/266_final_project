If I don't say anything, it's wrong
If I said it it wouldn't come out right
It's been keeping me up all night
Half my life I've been told to shut up
So how I'm gonna open up?
Wish you could just read my mind

If I shared all of me would you run away?
If I sugar coated what I had to say

In poetry would it make you stay?

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
Had all the words to speak my feelings
I wish I stood up like Rosa Parks
And followed my heart
Unafraid of the truth
Even if I stood alone
I didn't know how it was gonna go
Even if the water was cold
I'd take a deep breath
And get it off my chest
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan

They say either way you'll win
If you're feelin' it, why you gotta hold it in?
What is meant to be will be
But all their wisdom doesn't help me now
I'm scared and I gotta find out
How to speak my mind
Without metaphors and prose and rhymes
And still make you mine
I hope you know what I mean
When I'm acting mean

'Cause I will see what I mean
When I'm caught in between
I'm afraid

The real you is eluding me
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
Had all the words to speak my feelings
I wish I stood up like Rosa Parks
And followed my heart
Unafraid of the truth
Even if I stood alone
I didn't know how it was gonna go

Even if the water was cold
I'd take a deep breath
And get it off my chest
I wish I was born Bob Dylan

I wish I was born Bob Dylan

With you I'm ripped wide open at the seams
I'm not that tough
Wish you could hear the song inside of me
But it's not enough
And All the things I wanna say

To you are written on my face
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
Had all the words to speak my feelings
I wish I stood up like Rosa Parks
And followed my heart

Unafraid of the truth
Even if I stood alone
I didn't know how it was gonna go
Even if the water was cold
I'd take a deep breath
And get it off my chest

I wish I was born Bob Dylan
Even if I stood alone
Didn't know how it was gonna go
Gotta get it off my chest
And hope for the best
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
I wish I was born Bob Dylan
