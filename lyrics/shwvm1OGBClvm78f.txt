I was fine just a guy living on my own,
Waiting for the sky to fall
Then you called and changed it all,
Doll,

Velvet lips and the eyes to pull me in,
We both know you'd already win,
Mm you're original sin.

You fooled me once with your eyes now honey,
You fooled me twice with your lies and I say,

Sarah smiles like Sarah doesn't care,
She lives in her world so unaware.
Does she know that my destiny lies with her?

Sarah,
(Sarah, Sarah, Sarah)
Oh Sarah,
(Sarah)
are you saving me?

Waking up to a kiss and you're on your way,
I really hoped that you would stay,
But you left and went your own way,
Babe,

I don't mind, take your time, I got things to do,
Besides sit around and wait for you.
Oh and I hope you do too,

You fooled me once with your eyes now honey,
You fooled me twice with your lies and I say,

Sarah smiles like Sarah doesn't care,
She lives in her world so unaware,
Does she know that my destiny lies with her,

Sarah,
Oh Sarah,
are you saving me?

And it's killing me inside,
Consuming all my time,
You've left me blind,
And when I think I'm right,
You strip away my pride,
You cast it all aside but I say,

Sarah smiles like Sarah doesn't care,
She lives in her world so unaware,
Does she know that my destiny lies with her,

Sarah,
(Sarah)
Oh Sarah,
(Sarah)
are you saving me?
