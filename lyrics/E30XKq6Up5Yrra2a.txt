Shot for shot
Let the bullet penetrate me
Embrace me
Tell me stories of golden gods
The precision in your voice
Pierce the walls that I've build
Your eyes reach deep in me

Take a chance
They don't come much bigger than this
Dark Star spend another day with me
A dead surface that doesn't reflect
The storm underneath
Take a chance
Bring me the calm
When there's nothing
Expose the dark side
Aching and emotional

Expose the dark side
Impossible to tame
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me
Throw yourself

Into the eye of chaos
Infiltrate me

Sneak out before I awake
Take out the trash and burn it
Try to find a beautiful place to lay
These fragile bones of mine
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me
-Solo-

When there's nothing
Expose the dark side

Aching and emotional
Expose the dark side

Impossible to tame
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me
