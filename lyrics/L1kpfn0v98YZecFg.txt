I don't care if you hurt me some more
I don't care if you even the score
You can knock me and I don't care
You can mock me and I don't care
You can rock me just about anywhere
It's alright

'Cause you're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
I need you tonight
I need you tonight

I don't care if you use me again
I don't care if you abuse me again
You can make me I don't care
You can fake me I don't care
You can love me just about anywhere
It's alright

'Cause you're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
I need you tonight
Said I need you tonight

I don't want to feel sorry for you
You don't have to make believe it's you
You can pump me I don't care
You can bump me I don't care
You can love me just about anywhere
It's alright

You're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
I need you tonight
Said I need you tonight

You're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
I need you tonight
I need you tonight
I need you tonight
