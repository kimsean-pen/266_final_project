High tension
You're stuck in the back of my mind
Oh, I apologize
But soon its fine
Replay
My mind gets carried away
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Stand up
Get loose
Get over it
Skip your body into my confidence
(Ooh) it's meant to be
(Ooh) it's meant to be

Stand up
Get loose
Get over it
Skip your body into my confidence
(Ooh) it's meant to be
(Ooh) it's meant to be

Bad intentions
All the wrong reasons
To go out and play
You're breaking hearts
Each and every day
And if I may
It ain't the first time I've seen it before
I know its fun
Yeah yeah

Stand up
Get loose
Get over it
Skip your body into my confidence
(Ooh) it's meant to be
(Ooh) it's meant to be

Stand up
Get loose
Get over it
Skip your body into my confidence
(Ooh) it's meant to be
(Ooh) it's meant to be

Never expect
Never assume
Never ask
Or never demand
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I'm just being honest with you all

Stand up
Get loose
Get over it
Skip your body into my confidence

It's meant to be
It's meant to be
Get get get get get
It's meant to be

Stand up
Get loose
Get over it
Skip your body into my confidence
(Ooh) it's meant to be
(Ooh) it's meant to be

It's meant to be
It's meant to be
It's meant to be
It's meant to be
