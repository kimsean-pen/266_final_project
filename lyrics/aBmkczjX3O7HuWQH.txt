Here I lay
My stomach burning
Body in pain while the room keeps turning
There's blood on the sheets and my skin
I need a bigger hole to bury me in

What did I do last night and will I be ashamed

What did I do last night and will I be ashamed
I keep on losing but I can't stop playing this game

Here I lay
My throat on fire
My stomach acid it keeps getting higher and higher
And I'm locked on my hands and knees
In sweat and tears just begging please
I promise I won't do this again

I'm in a daze at the end of the bottle
Clearer days are all long forgotten

I need your help but I can't say it
Pull me out I ain't gonna make it
And I guess the only thing to do
Is break all of my promises to you
To you

And I know what is wrong from right
But I always roll the dice
Cos in my eyes there might be something better
And at this point
What's another measure

Rawr 
Yeah

I need your help but I can't say it
Pull me out I ain't gonna make it
And I guess the only thing to do
Is break all of my promises to you
To you

I need your help but I can't say it
Pull me out I ain't gonna make it
And I guess the only thing to do
Is break all of my promises to you
To you
