The vapour in my mind makes it hard to find
The things in life that I lost back in time
And the trail of my heart has turned all roads so dark
So hard to find, so hard to overcome

And all the things that I believed were true
Were never roots to anything but lies
To demons in disguise
And all the roads that I've been strolling down
Now I've found they all seem to be marooned
So profoundly doomed

And the vapour in my heart makes it hard to love
The things in life that I used to love
And the trail of my soul, has made me feel so cold
So lost in life, so down and so alone

And all the things that I believed were true
Were never roots to anything but lies
To demons in disguise
And all the roads that I've been strolling down
Now I've found they all seem to be marooned
So profoundly doomed

Aeons are passing in the blink of an eye
Moments frozen, all the years I've tried to deny
Memories haunt me as the years pass me by
Feel the dusk, feel the fall, feel the winter inside

On the seventh summer of my life
Saw you turn your back on it all and left me far behind
There's a river between us, it's become so wide
I wish that you could be right here
To mend my broken life

And all the things that I believed were true
Were never roots to anything but lies
To demons in disguise
And all the roads that I've been strolling down
Now I've found they all seem to be marooned
So profoundly doomed
