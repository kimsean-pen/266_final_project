From nowhere through the caravan
Round the campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
With hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark
That hypnotized me with love

She was a gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman

She danced around and round
To a guitar melody
From the fire her face was aglow
How she enchanted me
Oh how I'd like to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun
Everyone was having fun
I hate to see the lady go
Knowing she will never know
That I love her
That I love her

Gypsy woman
She was gypsy woman
Gypsy woman
Gypsy woman

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun
Everyone was having fun
I hate to see the lady go
Knowing she will never know
That I love her
I love her

Gypsy woman
Gypsy woman
She was gypsy woman
Gypsy woman

She was gypsy woman
She was gypsy woman
