I know my world won't fall apart without you around
Is my time, is my time to quit you now
It's all over girl
(your love)
My world my world I can't give you, right now
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, don't you worry
I'll be in the same world
(Your love)
(Can't give it up, no, no, all I ever wanted was to be with you)
(Feels good)
(Just right)
(Don't you leave me now, that the world is so hard)
I know my world won't fall apart without you around
Is my time, is my time to quit you now
It's all over girl
My world my world I can't give you, right now
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, don't you worry
I'll be in the same world
