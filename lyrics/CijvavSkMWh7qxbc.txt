I've got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we shared
Makes me wish that you were here
Cause now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life
All the songs have been erased
Guess I've learned from my mistakes

Open the past and present
Now and we are there
Story to tell and I am listening

Open the past and present

And the future too
It's all I've got and I'm giving it up to you
Loose ends tied in knots
Leaving a lump down in my throat

Gagging on a souvenir
Lodged to fill another year

Drag it on and on until my skin is ripped to shreds
Leaving myself open wide
Living out a sacrifice
Open the past and present.
Now and we are there
Story to tell and I am listening
Open the past and present
And the future too
It's all I've got and I'm giving it up to you
If you got no one and I've got no place to go, could it be alright?
Could it be alright?
I've got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we shared
Makes me wish that you were here
Cause now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life
All the songs have been erased
Guess I've learned from my mistakes
Open the past and present
Now and we are there
Story to tell and I am listening
Open the past and present
And the future too
It's all I've got and I'm giving it up to you
It's all I've got and I'm giving it up to you
