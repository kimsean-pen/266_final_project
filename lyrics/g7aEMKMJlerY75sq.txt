All dressed up you're good to go
Checkin your style from head to toe
Hooked up and natural
You're feeling beautiful
9 times outta 10 you know
Late night club like a video, with the hot stuff- top stuff- we got stuff oh

What a night (night), so far (far)
Pulling up curb side in your car (your car)
What a sight (sight), you are (are)
Think I know somewhere we can park
After dark

System up with the top down
Got the city on the lock down
Drive by in the low ride
Hands high when we fly by

System up with the top down
Got the city on the lock down
Drive by in the low ride
Hands high when we fly by

Girl it's time to let you know
I'm down if you wanna go
We can take it nice and slow
We got until tomorrow
UK Style UK flow
We got you hot like whoa
With the hot stuff top stuff (yo) we got stuff oh

What a night (night), so far (far)
Pulling up curb side in your car (your car)
What a sight (sight), you are (are)
Think I know somewhere we can park
After dark

System up with the top down
Got the city on the lock down
Drive by in the low ride
Hands high when we fly by

System up with the top down
Got the city on the lock down
Drive by in the slow ride
Hands high when we fly by

I'll tell you this for a fact, fact
A lot of ladies step up on a fat track
Leave your fella in the corner
With his starter cap
Show me how to act
Show me love, where you at?

What a night, so far
Pulling up curb side in your car
What a sight, you are
Think I know somewhere we can park
After dark

System up with the top down
Got the city on the lock down
Drive by in the slow ride
Hands high when we fly by

System up with the top down (top down)
Got the city on the lock down (lock down)
Drive by in the slow ride
Hands high when we fly by
(After daaaaaaark)
System up with the top down
Got the city on the lock down
Drive by in the slow ride
Hands high when we fly by (we fly by)
System up with the top down
Got the city on the lock down
Drive by in the slow ride
Hands high when we fly by
