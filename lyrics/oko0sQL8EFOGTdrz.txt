Hope there's someone who'll take care of me
When I die, will I go?

Hope there's someone who'll set my heart free
Nice to hold
When I'm tired

There's a ghost on the 'rizon
When I
Go to bed
How can I fall asleep at night?
How will I rest my head?

O, I'm scared of the middle place!
Between light
And nowhere
I don't want to be the one
Left in there, left in there

There's a man on the 'rizon
Wish that I
Go to bed
If I fall to his feet tonight
Will I rest my head?

So here's hoping I will not drown
Or paralyze in light
And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed

Hope there's someone who'll take care of me
When I die, will I go?

Hope there's someone who'll set my heart free
Nice to hold
When I'm tired
