I'm from the broke land
You could get smoked, man
In the New York minute, with the newborns hittin'
Breakin' news report, better hide your children too
Another ape loose from the Brooklyn Zoo
So I could pace in the blue
The jace got word from the same face, snakes that bit you too
So get loose, when they gettin' public, they gettin' goose bumps
It's duck season, leave your rooster slumped
Early in the morning put the wormy in her mouth
I'm from the north, but I make [?] south
Back to this cheese, no time for cat and mouse
I get you sproused, let it out, look who's spazzin' now
