Drive west on sunset to the sea
Turn that jungle music down
Just until we're out of town
This is no one night stand
It's a real occasion
Close your eyes and you'll be there
It's everything they say
The end of a perfect day
Distant lights from across the bay
(babylon sisters shake it)
(babylon sisters shake it)
So fine so young
(tell me I'm the only one)

(here come those Santa Ana winds again)

We'll jog with show folk on the sand
Drink kirschwasser from a shell
San Francisco show and tell
Well I should know by now
That it's just a spasm
Like a Sunday in T.J.
That it's cheap but it's not free
That I'm not what I used to be
And that love's not a game for three

(babylon sisters shake it)
(babylon sisters shake it)
So fine so young
(tell me I'm the only one)
(here comes those Santa Ana winds again)

My friends say no
Don't go for their cotton candy
Son you're playing with fire
The kid will live and learn
As he watches his bridges burn
From the point of no return

(babylon sisters shake it)
(babylon sisters shake it)
So fine so young
(tell me I'm the only one)
(you gotta shake it, baby)
(you gotta shake it, baby)
(you gotta shake it)
(you gotta shake it, baby)
(you gotta shake it, baby)
(you gotta shake it)
(you gotta shake it, baby)
