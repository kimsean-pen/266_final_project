Lipstick and Polaroids
Late night hanging with your boy
Record player playing white noise
That's the way, that's the way I
Like it when the stars are out
Drop top cruising out of town
You and me, it's going down
That's the way, that's the way

Hold me down, I'll play your game
Kiss until I, I
I'm addicted to your everything, everything

My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish

Black nails and denim jeans
Every night feeling like a dream
Always know just what I need
That's the way, that's the way I
Like it when you play a little rough
Breathe you in, can't get enough
Keep it in, oh, I need a rush
That's the way, that's the way

Hold me down, I'll play your game
Kiss until I, I
I'm addicted to your everything, everything

My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish

Blurring all the lines, lost in paradise
Woah, woah
Baby stay the night, fading out of time
Woah, woah

My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish

Falling into you, foolish
Falling into you, foolish.
