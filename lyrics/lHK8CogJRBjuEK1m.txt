I am being haunted (haunted)

I am here all by myself
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am here all by myself
And you're somewhere else with someone else

I am, I am, I am, I am
I am here all by myself
I am, I am, I am, I am
And you're somewhere else with someone else
I am, I am, I am, I am

It's four o'clock in the morning
And I'm sitting on my stairs
And there's bangin' round the bedroom
But no one knows there's no one there

And I am here all by myself
And you're somewhere else with someone else
And I am being haunted by a love that isn't there

There is something in my house, my house
It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair
There is something in my house, my house
I just keep a hearing you runnin' on up my stairs
But you're not there

I really gotta say it to ya
Ya showed me a good time
But for every minute that you spent laughin'
There were hours that I cried
And I think about what might have been
If I'd never met that wicked queen
And my heart broke into pieces at midnight on Halloween

There is something in my house, my house
It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair
There is something in my house, my house
I just keep a hearing you runnin' on up my stairs
But you're not there

It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair
There is something in my house, my house
But you're not there

It's just a ghost, it's just a ghost
It's just a ghost, it's just a ghost
It's just a ghost, it's just a ghost
It's just a ghost
Just a ghost, just a ghost, just a ghost

And I am here all by myself
And you're somewhere else with someone else
And I am being haunted by a love that isn't there

There is something in my house, my house
It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair
There is something in my house, my house
I just keep a hearing you runnin' on up my stairs
But you're not there

It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair
There is something in my house, my house
But you're not there

It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair
There is something in my house, my house
It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair
There is something in my house, my house
I just keep a hearing you runnin' on up my stairs
But you're not there

I am being haunted
I am being haunted

I am, I am, I am, I am
I am being haunted

It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair
There is something in my house, my house
It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair
There is something in my house, my house
I just keep a hearing you runnin' on up my stairs
But you're not there

There is something in my house, my house
It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair
There is something in my house, my house
I just keep a hearing you runnin' on up my stairs
But you're not there
