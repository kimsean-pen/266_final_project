Powerless, depressed
I try to conceal all the wreckage inside
But they are denied the basic rights
Hand delivered to all of mankind

My patience tried, forgiveness died
My hands are tied, let go
All of the scars built up the walls
Life drifting far below

Instinct can't save you now
Man stand up, take a bow
The sun always hides behind the clouds
Always

Tell me when did we lose our way?
Why is the whole world our prey?
Inhumane is the trend nowadays
How much more can they pay in the end?
The end?

My patience tried, forgiveness died
My hands are tied, let go
All of the scars built up the walls
Life drifting far below

Instinct can't save you now
Man stand up, take a bow
The sun always hides behind the clouds
Always

How blind we've been to let destructive forces fly
Deaf ears hear them, closed hands feel them
Empathy begins when all this ends

End all innocent lives right now
We bring nothing and claim the crown
End all innocent lives right now
We bring nothing and claim the crown
