Ever since I was a baby girl I had a dream
Cinderella theme, crazy as it seems
Always knew that deep inside that there would come a day
When I would have to way, make so many mistakes

I couldn't comprehend as I watched it unfold
This classic story told I left it in the cold
Walking through an open door that led me back to you
Each one unlocking more of the truth

I finally stopped tripping on my youth
I finally got lost inside of you
I finally know that I needed to grow
And finally my maze has been solved

Finally, Now my destiny can begin
Though it will have a different set
Something strange and new is happening

Finally, Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him finally

I remember the beginning you already knew
I acted like a fool, just trying to be cool
Fronting like it didn't matter, I just ran away
On another face, was lost in my own space

Found what it's like to hurt selfishly
Scared to give of me, afraid to just believe
I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place
Stumbled through the nets that I had made

Finally got out of my own way
I've finally started living for today
I finally know, I needed to grow
And finally know that it must be so

Finally, Now my destiny can begin
Though we will have a different set
Something strange and new is happening

Finally, Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Gave my love to him finally
Finally, finally
Finally, Now my destiny can begin
Though it will have a different set
Something beautiful is happening, is happening
Finally, Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him finally
Oh, finally, finally, finally
