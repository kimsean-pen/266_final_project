We belong to the world
We belong to the wind
We are the spirit of the competition's end
Turning hours into days
Burning muscles feel the pain
The heart and soul of discipline, my friends

We are sending you a challenge
It's very clear
We came to win, that is why we are here
Demanding to be tested
Tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest

The time has come
All the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay

Let the game begin
Hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today
We will overcome
When the game is over
All the counting's done
We were born to win
Number 1

Today is the day
All the training through
We have come the Number 1
Not the Number 2
Let the contest begin
Play hard, fight to win
Immortality, victory and fame

The time has come
All the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay

Let the game begin
Hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today
We will overcome
When the game is over
All the counting's done
We were born to win
Number 1

Today is the day
All the training through
We have come for the Number 1
Not the Number 2
Let the contest begin
Play hard, fight to win
Immortality, victory and fame

Let the game begin
Hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today
We will overcome
When the game is over
All the counting's done
We were born to win
Number 1
