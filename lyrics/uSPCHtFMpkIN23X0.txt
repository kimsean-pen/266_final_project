If you gotta run, run from hope
If you gotta run, run from hope
If you gotta run, run from hope
If you gotta run, run from hope
Ah ah ah ah

I know I'll never be lonely
I've got songs in my blood
I'm carrying all the love of an orchestra

Gimme the love of an orchestra
Gimme the love of an orchestra
Gimme the love of an orchestra

So now in my deepest sorrow
there's no need for despair
I'm carrying all the love of an orchestra

Gimme the love of an orchestra
Gimme the love of an orchestra
Gimme the love of an orchestra

If you gotta run, run from hope
If you gotta run, run from hope
If you gotta run, run from hope
If you gotta run, run from hope
Ah ah ah ah
