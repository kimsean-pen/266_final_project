Down a spiral stairway
Like a blackout memory
You prop up your work
Like a figure of straw
Keeping your ghosts from the garden
But is it red ripe or deadened skin?
Spiraling further in
Spiraling further in

Burn a candle to my skin
Turn the handle, let me in
I can not be your guardian anymore
Burn a candle to my skin
Turn the handle, let me in
I can not be your medicine anymore, anymore

I am a moment in time
When your eyes start to wander
And your head starts to spin
From the simplest task
Deciding what you will wear
Finding faults in a straight line
I have to remember to stop
Wringing out the same cloth

Burn a candle to my skin
Turn the handle, let me in
I can not be your guardian anymore
Burn a candle to my skin
Turn the handle, let me in
I can not be your medicine anymore, anymore

Burn a candle to my skin
Turn the handle, let me in
I can not be your guardian anymore
Burn a candle to my skin
Turn the handle, let me in
I can not be your medicine anymore, anymore
