I can sit here watching you do all your stupid shit
All day long and i won't stop until you're through with it
You can make me laugh and turn around and make me cry
Such a complicated love is difficult to find

But you can have it
Take me and my pride
Take me for my body
Take all of my time
Take all of my money
And all that's in between
I will always want you
Every single piece

Everything in the beating of your heart
Everything in feeling of your skin
I want your everything (I want your everything)
Everything in the past that you regret
Everything in the future we can win
I want your everything (I want your everything)

Work is work and love is hard and moods are day to day
We can watch the years go by and cover up our grays
Every night i pray for you before i go to sleep
Asking god to keep you safe and keep you close to me

So in a decade
I can show you how
I will always love you
Even more now

Everything in the beating of your heart
Everything in feeling of your skin
I want your everything (I want your everything)
Everything in the past that you regret
Everything in the future we can win
I want your everything (I want your everything)

Whatever you do just know that I'll be here for you
Whatever you do just know that I'll be here
Whatever you do just know that I'll be here for you
Whatever you do just know that I'll be here
Whatever you do just know that I'll be here for you
Whatever you do just know that I'll be here

Everything in the beating of your heart
Everything in feeling of your skin
I want your everything (I want your everything)
Everything in the past that you regret
Everything in the future we can win
I want your everything (I want your everything)
Everything in the beating of your heart
Everything in feeling of your skin
I want your everything (I want your everything)
Everything in the past that you regret
Everything in the future we can win
I want your everything (I want your everything)

I want your everything
