I met a girl, she was crazy about me
And in a lifetime this happens once or twice, maybe
And who'd have thought that it would ever happen to me?
I met a girl, she was crazy about me

The two of us are getting high
We don't need drugs 'cause we know how to fly
The two of us are getting high
We don't need the drugs, just the two of us
The two of us are getting high

I met a boy, he was crazy about me
And all my friends say he is the other half of me
And everybody says we are so young and free
I met a boy, he was crazy about me

The two of us are getting high
We don't need drugs 'cause we know how to fly
The two of us are getting high
We don't need the drugs, just the two of us
The two of us are getting high

Well, I was born the day that I met you
I couldn't leave you if I tried
In a thousand years, I couldn't forget you
'Cause you're the reason I'm alive

You're the reason I'm alive
You're the reason I'm alive

The two of us are getting high
We don't need drugs 'cause we know how to fly
The two of us are getting high
We don't need drugs 'cause we know how to fly
The two of us are getting high
We don't need the drugs, just the two of us
The two of us are getting high
