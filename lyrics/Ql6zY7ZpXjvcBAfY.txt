My hopes are high
But my eyes can't believe what they see, no
Oh, give me something to believe
Give me something to believe

Oh, I've got lucky in life and had plenty to eat
And I saw this world as one big pool of opportunity
Oh but there's too much mind corruption
Too little remedy or that's how it seems to me
Yeah, we need a moral education to set the young minds free

So let us change what we can and accept what we can't
And impart some of the wisdom from that tried and tested man
Oh, there's no harm in being wrong, you know, no
In fact to me, it's common ground, yeah

So take that feather from you cap, sir
And pass that feather around

My hopes are high
But my eyes can't believe what they see
Oh, give me something to believe in
Give me something to believe, yeah

Oh, my hopes are high
But my eyes can't believe what they see
Oh, my hopes are high
Oh, give me something
Give me something to believe
