Tori: Promise not to say
Tash: that you told me so
Promise not to say
Tori: that I'm getting too old
Tash: Promise not to take
Tori: never take your phone
Tash: I mean take their word
Tori: you mean over yours?
what I need to know, will you
Tash: Be there
Tori: Where the sun shines
Tash: I will be there
Tori: you are the light
Tash: that follows you everywhere
Tash and Tori: look for my love
Tash: where the sun shines
I will be there
Tori: will you
Tash: Promise not to judge
Tori: to judge who you love
I don't know if I...
Tash: Yes, make that Promise
Tori: whatever it is
Tash: can you hear the truth
if they accuse me
Tori: you think I'll doubt you?
what I need to know, will you
Tash: be there
when I am all alone
Tori: you're not alone
Tash: when I am broken down
Tori: we all break down
Tash: when every door is closed
Tori: there is one more
Tash: will you look for me?
I will rescue you
