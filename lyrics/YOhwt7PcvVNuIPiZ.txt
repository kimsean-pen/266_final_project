I love my bionic eyes. I love my crystal vision.
If there's anybody out there baby, I'm not gonna miss him

I've watched the years go by
These are the same old guys I never had any use for
Beyond the feeling of pleasure
Or the thrill of the fight
I scored again last night
I said, "thanks for the drinks. Nice party," then I turned out the light

I've got timing and attitude
That can get to the baddest dude
That's when I hypnotize him
With my bionic eyes

As I got older, I had to step out of the lines and make my own mind
As I got light as feather, they got stiff as a board
I can't feel anymore, but I can fake it forever

It's easy in the beginning when I can dazzle them all night

Make 'em do what you want 'em to
Get 'em running after you
It's just the same old guys
Wearing the same old ties

As I got older, I had to step out of the lines and make my own mind
As I got light as feather, they got stiff as a board
I can't feel anymore, but I can fake it forever

I love my bionic eyes
I love my bionic eyes
I love my bionic eyes
I love my bionic eyes

If there's a parallel nation
And I'm a secret weapon
Show me a man you cannot break
And I will show you heaven

As I got older, I had to step out of the lines and make my own mind
As I got light as feather, they got stiff as a board
I can't feel anymore, but I can fake it forever
