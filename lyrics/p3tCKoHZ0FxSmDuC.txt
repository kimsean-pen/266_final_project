Plants and rags
Ease myself into a body bag

dreamt a man
He fed me fine food
He gave me shiny things

I dreamt of a man
He fed me fine food
He gave me shiny things

White and black
You looking for the sun boy
The sun doesn't shine down here
No no no

White and black
You looking for the sun boy
The sun doesn't shine down here
In shadows

House and home
Who thought they could take away that place
Outside, and they lead us out quietly
Lead us outside, and they lead us out quietly

House and home
Who thought they could take away that place
Outside, they lead us out quietly
They lead us outside, and they lead us out quietly
