Walking in circles
Heavy thoughts are on our chests
Never thought I
Would be in such a mess

Oh, won't you please just stick around
Just stick around, just stick around

Hands in my pockets
I'm feeling kinda down
Don't wanna make a scene
But I'm tired of holding on

Train's coming our way
I'll make sure I'm okay
Don't turn your back around

(Slow it down, slow it down)

Slow it down, slow it down
Can't we wait for the next eastbound
Train to come, train to come
I'm doing my best to keep my calm

(Slow it down, slow it down)
(Stick around, stick around)
