The place we went and sought for beauty, depth and silence

No matter how hard we looked
We never got to stay

Whatever there was we found
Could only makes us wonder

The things we try to hold on
Would always fade away

Those night we lost
In vain we hide
We only see
What was left behind

So hard we tried
to realize
The only peace
Is a state of mind
