We love our tragedies
We're both broken in our own little ways
We're broken, but we fit together just right
You know, I saw the black inside your eyes
I saw they were eclipsed by mine and they looked just right

When our lights meet, will you know me then?
And will you want to know it?
It feels like I've known you for so long

When our lips meet, will you want me then?
And will you ever know it?
It seems like you've known me for so long.

I love your analogies
We're both crazy in our own little ways
We talk about the future, and our past lives
I know I loved you then, I know I'd love you now
I know I'll love you then, I know I love you now

It seems like I've known you for so long

But you can't have everything you want when you want it
I will be everything you want when you want it

Wait for me, trust for me, fall for me
Even when you don't know you'll fall for me,
Will you fall for it?

If it should, it'll come around again
But don't wait for me, and don't trust in me, don't fall for me
Even when you know you're falling for me.

When our hearts meet, will we make it then?
Will we even notice that they are eclipsed?
