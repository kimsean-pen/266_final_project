Baby, I know you are hurting
Right now you feel like you could never love again
Now all I ask is for a chance
To prove that I love you

From the first day that I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would be together forever
Ooh, when I asked you out, you said, "No"
But I found out darling that you'd been hurt
You felt that you'd never love again

I deserve a try honey just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me (give you all of me)
Honey, that's no lie (that's no lie)

I'll never break your heart (never break your hurt)
I'll never make you cry (I never wanna see you cry)
I'd rather die than live without you (baby, no, no, live without you)
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

As time goes by you will get to know me
A little more better
Girl, that's the way love goes, baby baby
And I (I) know you're afraid (know you're afraid)
To let your feelings show (feelings show)
And I understand but
Girl, it's time to let go (girl, it's time to let go because)

I deserve a try (try), honey, just once (once)
Give me chance (chance)
And I'll prove this all wrong (wrong you walked)
You walked in, you were so quick to judge (quick to judge)
But honey, he's nothing like me
Darling, why can't you see?

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry (make you cry)
I'd rather die than live without you (I'd rather die than live without you, girl)
I'll give you all of me (give you all of me, baby)
Honey, that's no lie

I'll never break your heart (your heart)
I'll never make you cry (I'll never make you cry)
I'd rather die than live without you (die, can't live without you)
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie (I'll never break your heart)

(I'll never break your heart) No way (no way)
(Girl, I'll never make you cry) no how (Make you cry)
I swear (Oh I, oh I, I swear)
No way, no how (I'll never break your heart girl, I'll never make you cry)
That's no lie

I'll never break your heart (break your heart, I would never do that to you)
I'll never make you cry (oh, just give me a chance and I'll show you show much I love you)
I'd rather die than live without you (I would die, rather die than live without you)
I'll give you all of me (I would give you the world)
Honey that's no lie
I'll never break your heart (I'll never, I'll never, I'll never, I'll never)
I'll never make you cry (I'll never, no, I won't)
I'd rather die than live without you (baby, honey, I'd never)
I'll give you all of me
Honey that's no lie (I want you, I need you)

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey that's no lie

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
