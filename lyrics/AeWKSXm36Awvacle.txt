My transplanted head needs a change of direction
I can't find a hole I can put my erection
I hate my lover and she hates me
I don't know what I'm supposed to be

I'm facing up to the facts
I'm facing up to the facts
I'm facing up to the facts

I'm back from the dead and I need penetration
My heart on a stick gets a standing ovation
I hate my brother and he hates me
That's the way it's supposed to be

I'm facing up to the facts
I'm facing up to the facts
I'm facing up to the facts

You know there's no safety net
You know this is all we get
You know I can't take no more

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Facing up to the
Facing up to the
Facing up to the facts
Facing up to the facts
Facing up to the facts
