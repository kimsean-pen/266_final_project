Oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh, oh-oh

I'm a saint, and I'm a sinner
I'm a loser and a winner
Without faith and a believer
I am true and the deceiver
I'm a hero and a villain
I'm a myth, and I'm a legend
Without strength and a contender
I am real and the pretender

Take me as I am, or don't
'Cause I don't give a damn, no
Take me as I am, or don't
'Cause I don't give a damn, no

I have my flaws
I make mistakes
But I'm myself
I'm not ashamed
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh

I have my doubts
I lose my strength
Sometimes I fall, but I don't break
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh

I'm a poet and a soldier
I am young and growing older
Without hope, but I'm a dreamer
I'm the cure, and I'm the fever
I am lost with a direction
I am failure and perfection
Without grace, but I am tired
Of walking life like it's a wire

Take me as I am, or don't
'Cause I don't give a damn, no
Take me as I am, or don't
'Cause I don't give a damn, no

I have my flaws
I make mistakes
But I'm myself
I'm not ashamed
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh

I have my doubts
I lose my strength
Sometimes I fall, but I don't break
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh

I don't want to be someone else
I don't ever want to lose this higher
Never gonna try to change myself, oh-oh oh-oh-oh
When everybody's got their soul on sale
I don't want to be just a number
Never gonna try to change myself, oh-oh oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh oh
I have my flaws
I make mistakes
But I'm myself
I'm not ashamed
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh

I have my doubts
I lose my strength
Sometimes I fall, but I don't break
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh

That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh

That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am (oh)
That's who I am
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
