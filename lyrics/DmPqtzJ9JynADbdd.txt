Battle of gods
Fires beneath the one
Throne on the rise

Sons of the dark
From the mighty mountain we ride

North
Northern chaos gods
North
Northern chaos gods

Shadows arise
As the final prophecies blacken the sky
The battle of all
Rage from the mighty mountainside

North
Northern chaos gods
North
Northern chaos gods

Chaos has called its sons
Blackened from beyond
Hordes upon the ice
Where warriors ride through the final winterstorm
From the mountainous battleside
Come the echoes of battlecry
Come the wrath of the gods
Fires and battles and blood
The immortal sons and the hordes of Blashyrkh
By the north
Northern chaos gods
North, north
Northern chaos gods

Once shadows before now by the mighty mountain ride
Daylight all darkened under blood red sky
Thunderous ice, fanfares of old
The hordes of Blashyrkh bow to none

North
Northern chaos gods
North
Northern chaos gods

Out from the gates of the shadows we ride
Unleash the powers of battle and strife
Out from the ice, darkness to rise
Under the banner of Blashyrkh we ride

Battle of gods
Fires beneath the one
Throne on the rise

Battle 'em all
Now by the mighty ones you ride

North
Northern chaos gods
North
Northern chaos gods

Hordes of Blashyrkh
Kings of the Rabenrealms
Hordes of Blashyrkh
Sons of northern darkness ride
