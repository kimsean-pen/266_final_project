If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
I would be behind him

Straight shook up beside him
With strength he didn't know
It's you I'm fighting for

He can't lose with me in tow
I refuse to let him go
At his side and drunk on pride
Will he wait for the blow?

Put it in writing
But who you writing for
Is just us on kitchen floor

Justice done, reciting
My stomach standing still
Like you're reading my will

He still stands in spite of what his scars say
And I'll battle till this bitter finale
Just me, my dignity
And this guitar case

Yes, yes, my man is fighting
Some unholy war
And I will stand beside you

But who you dying for
B, I would have died too
I'd like to

If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
If my man was fighting
