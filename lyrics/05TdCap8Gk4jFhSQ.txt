And I've got a lot to lose, you've got a lot to prove
I've got a lot to risk, you know I can't afford to miss
So we're gonna run around forever just typing
Thinking of what could have been mine and
I know you say you're sorry you'll type back before
Running round in limbo, running round it all
(Running round in limbo, running round it all)
Show me that there's something I could go back for
Show me that there's love worth fighting for
Give me a good reason to believe at all
Running round in limbo, running round it all
If you say you're scared then I'm terrified
If you say you're ready then I'm justified
If you say it's easy then you've crossed the line
If you say it's over then I'm in denial
Show me that there's something I could go back for
Show me that there's love worth fighting for
Give me a good reason to believe at all
Running round in limbo, running round it all
And I've got a lot to lose, you've got a lot to prove
Show me that there's something I could go back for
(Show me that there's love)
Cause we're running round in limbo, running round it all
(Show me that there's love)
Show me that there's something I could go back for
(Show me that there's love)
Show me, cause we're running round in limbo, running round it all
(Running round in limbo, running round it all)
