Such a long time ago
Now I know
You've woke up to find
You were wrong
There ain't no doubt
Put me out
Nearly made me blind

You sent me a letter, brought tears to my eyes
Tell me you've changed, after all this time
Like a stone rolling down the mountainside
It's over, you can't turn the tide, and it's

Tears falling about love, falling without love
Tears falling about love, falling without love

I was glad
To be with you
Near to you
My heart can't deny
I was sad
To leave your side
Stripped of pride
When you said goodbye
For every new road there must be a friend
For every broken heart there must be a mend
And the rain only lasted so long
It's over, the thing we had is gone, and it's

To tell me you've changed brought tears to my eyes
Say you've rearranged after all this time
Like a stone rolling down the mountainside
It's over, you can't turn the tide, and it's
