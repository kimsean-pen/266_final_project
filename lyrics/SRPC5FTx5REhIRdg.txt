Gone for days
Cut the chase
Bite the bullet time
Ease the pain

Give me something new she said
Tell me something new instead

Fornicate
A love to break

I know we're all so self obsessed, so materialistic, over-sexed
I know we're all so self assured, burn a hole right through this perfect world

Blown away
Learn to taste
Find the essence now
Shake the frame

Give me something new she said
Tell me something new instead
Give me something new she said
Tell me something new instead

I know we're all so self obsessed, so materialistic, over-sexed
I know we're all so self assured, burn a hole right through this perfect world

Yeah, I wish I could be like you
Yeah, I wish I could be like you

We held their place, and stars come down, I must confess
She said...
I must contest we're too far gone, our hands won't mesh
She said...

You're the milk
Ease the guilt
There's no substitute
You're the milk

I know we're all so self obsessed, so materialistic, over-sexed
I know we're all so self assured, burn a hole right through this perfect world

Yeah, I wish I could be like you
Yeah, I wish I could be like you
Yeah, I wish I could be like you
Yeah, I wish I could be like you
