1 o'clock and I can't sleep
something calls me from the deep
2 o'clock I'm still awake
avalon's beyond the lake
3 o'clock there's something here
slowly moving up the stairs
4 o'clock with thoughts like rust
open wounds from blades of dust

Embrance the break of day
with yesterday still in motion
the walking dreams will pave
the road to my corrosion
embrace the break of day

5 o'clock has come and gone
inside my head the lights still on
6 o'clock I hear a sound
although I know no one's around
7 o'clock on waves of fear
a distant sea moves in my ear
8 o'clock as daylight breaks
never gives more than it takes
