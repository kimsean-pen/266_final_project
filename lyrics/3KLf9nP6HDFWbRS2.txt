Your sins are forgiven let me down
Your sins are forgiven let me down
Take these nails from my hands
Take this thorny crown
Your sins they are forgiven let me down

Your sins they are forgiven have a look
Your sins they are forgiven won't you have a look
Your sins they are forgiven it says it in the holy book
Your sins they are forgiven have a look

Your sins they are forgiven let me down
Your sins they are forgiven won't you let me down
Your sins they are forgiven
I'm not takin I'm just given here
Your sins they are forgiven let me down

Your sins they are forgiven I'm off the hook
Your sins they are forgiven I'm off the hook
Your sins they are forgiven
Just like it tells us in the holy book
Your sins they are forgiven I'm off the hook

Your sins are forgiven let me down
Your sins they are forgiven won't you let me down
Take these nails from my hands
Take this thorny crown
Your sins they are forgiven won't you let me down
