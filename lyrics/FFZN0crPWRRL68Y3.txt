I caught a glimpse
But it's been forgotten

So here we are again
I made a vow
To carry you home
Home

I really tried
To do what you wanted
It all went wrong again

I made a vow
To carry you home
If you fall sick
If you pass out
Out

I figured it out
I figured it out
I figured it out
I figured it out

I can see again
I can see again
I can see again
I can see again
I can see again
