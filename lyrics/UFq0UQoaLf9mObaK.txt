Mountain on top, a fire below
The pressure grows, pressure
I feel the weight of a billion years
Come down on me, come down
I try to do it alright
I went down, down, down
Working hard, little delight
I forgot the sound, of diamonds.

So bright I cannot hide them
So heavy I cannot mine
All of this pressure's making
Diamonds, so wild I cannot tame
So shiny I cannot name
All of this pressure's making
Diamonds, disperse the white light.

Dancing on top, the glitter glows
The pressure slows, pressure
I feel the blade, the cutting edge
Move out, out, out.
I try to do it alright
I went down, down down
Working hard, little delight
I forgot the sound
of Diamonds.

So bright I cannot hide them
So heavy I cannot mine
All of this pressure's making
Diamonds, so wild I cannot tame
So shiny I cannot name
All of this pressure's making
Diamonds, disperse the white light.

Pink, purple, green, red, yellow, blue
I am in that mood indigo
Pink, purple, green, red, yellow, blue
I am in that mood, for diamonds.

So bright I cannot hide them
So heavy I cannot mine
All of this pressure's making
Diamonds, so wild I cannot tame
So shiny I cannot name
All of this pressure's making
Diamonds, disperse the white light.
Disperse the white light
