You're original
No matter what you're sold
Oh, you, oh, you
You've got a lot to brave
You'll always find a way
It's true, it's true

Fighting from different sides
Trying to save it tonight, ooo, oh ooo
So open up the scars
And let the healing start for you, for you
A sea of broken hearts, scars
Maybe now it's time to embrace the dark
Love us and walk the way we're talking

Now I think it is time for us
We're ready to fight, no gloves
They might drag us out in cuffs
But we're standing up
Yeah, we're standing up
For love, for love
Oh, this time we'll fight for love
Fight for love, for love
Oh, this time we'll fight for love, fight for love

Been battling our fears
Been holding back our tears to get through, get through
But next to you, I'm stronger
I cover up no longer, let loose, let loose

Fighting from different sides
Trying to save it tonight, ooo, oh ooo
So open up the scars
And let the healing start for you, for you
A sea of broken hearts, scars
Maybe now it's time to embrace the dark
Love us and walk the way we're talking

Now I think it is time for us
We're ready to fight, no gloves
They might drag us out in cuffs
But we're standing up
Yeah, we're standing up
For love, for love
Oh, this time we'll fight for love
Fight for love, for love
Oh, this time we'll fight for love, fight for love
