I pick you up and we ride
'till the end of the earth
We can give it a try
But it will never work
Oh, no, I lied
Oh, no, you cried
Oh, you lied
Oh, no, I tried
Badillac!
Badillac!
Badillac!
Badillac!
Well I hate myself
And I hate the earth
We could give it a try
But it will never work
Oh, no, I lied
Oh, no, you cried
Oh, you lied
Oh, no, I died
