Everybody's tellin' everybody off
It's the last thing I wanna hear
You've
Been killing me for days and days it seems
But the truth is the thing I fear
I just don't understand

Why my love isn't good enough
I just don't understand
Why my love isn't good
Enough
For you
I want you to show me
Love and affection
Love and affection
Easing the
Tension
With love and affection

Everybody's showin' everybody up
It's a competition me and
You
I stood outside your doorway
Watching you ignore me
I still think that your games ar cute

I just don't understand
Why my love isn't good enough
I just don't understand
Why
My love isn't good enough
For you
I want you to show me
Love and affection
Love
And affection
Easing the tension
With love and affection

Put yourself in my shoes
Put yourself in my shoes
I don't know what you've been told
The rich get rich, the poor
Grow old
When everybody's blood runs cold
It's time for something real
Ah ah ah ah

Love and affection
Love and affection
Easing the tension
With love and affection

I just don't understand
Why my blood is
I just don't understand
Why my love is not
