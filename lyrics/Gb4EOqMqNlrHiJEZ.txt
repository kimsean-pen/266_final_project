Here I sit, all alone,
Thinkin' bout what I should of known,
You make me think that I could need you,
You weaved your magic spell and I believed you.

Looking back, on you and me,
Promises that will, never be,
I truely thought that we were lovers, (lovers)
But now I find i'm just like all the others.

Heartbreaker, wish i'd seen that love was blind,
Sweet little love maker, taking my heart and leaving me behind,
Heartbreaker, couldn't you be just a little more kind, to me?

Played with fire, felt it's burn,
I would have thought that I would of learned,
I melted every time you kissed me, (kissed me)
Everytime you'd leave I thought you'd miss me.

Heartbreaker, wish i'd seen that love was blind,
Sweet little love maker, taking my heart and leaving me behind,
Heartbreaker, couldn't you be just a little more kind, to me?

Heartbreaker, wish i'd seen that love was blind,
Sweet little love maker, taking my heart and leaving me behind,
Heartbreaker, couldn't you be just a little more kind, to me?

Heartbreaker, wish i'd seen that love was blind,
