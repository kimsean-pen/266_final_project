It's times like these when I'm on my way out of the woods
Never felt better than when I'm on my way out for good
It's times like these when I'm on my way back out of the woods
I'll never be afraid again now I'm out of here for good

It was just a dream
The most beautiful place I've seen
The white caps and the pines
Ripped our nations in the sea

It's times like these when I'm on my way back out of the woods
I've never felt better than when I'm on my way out for good

Now I've finally found
All my friends are in the clouds
Alone now, in my head now
All alone now, in my head

It's times like these when I'm on my way back out of the woods
I've never felt better than when I'm on my way out for good

Now I've finally found
All my friends are in the clouds
Alone now, in my head now
All alone now, in your head

And I've waited just so long
To sing you this final song

Time keeps ticking, time keeps pushing, time keeps rolling along
