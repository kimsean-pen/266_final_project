I don't remember his name
But I've got the keys to his house.
He slipped them into my tights
Just before we got kicked out.
After the show I was feeling so low,
Ordered two more mojitos.
On the rebound
The first face that I found
Laid me down like Romeo.

Leo, Rodrigo, live in the moment then let it go.
Marco, Diego, I'll give you tonight but I won't call you tomorrow.

And when the sun is rising up
I get my things and run
And if I wrote my number wrong,
Life goes on, just move on, just move on

I don't remember his face
But I remember when I came.
He spoke the language of love,
No there's no need to mansplain
Lock up your husbands and lock up your sons,
Tell the girls I'm coming around.
I get my kicks, learn some new fancy tricks
Let them know what I'm about.

Tito, D'angelo,
Live in the moment then let it go.
Nico, Antonio, I'll give you tonight
But I won't call you tomorrow.

And when the sun is rising up
I get my things and run
And if I wrote my number wrong,
Life goes on, just move on, just move on

And when the birds begin to sing,
I get my things and leave.
And if I wrote my number wrong,
Life goes on, just move on, just move on

And when the sun is rising up
I get my things and run
And if I wrote my number wrong,
Life goes on, just move on, just move on

And when the birds begin to sing,
I get my things and leave.
And if I wrote my number wrong,
Life goes on, just move on, just move on
