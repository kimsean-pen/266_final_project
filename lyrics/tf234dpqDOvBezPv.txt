We're breaking things we can't repair
But none of us will take the blame
No, nothing can be done this time
All the memories that we've made
I threw them all away
There's no need to talk it over

Don't let me get you down
Let's just move on
I am setting you free

'Cause I don't wanna hurt no more
No, I don't wanna make you
Go through one more rainy day
No, I don't wanna hurt no more

Strange enough, I always knew
I'm taking off today
Don't wanna hurt no more

The darkness you left in my soul
Now do we know how much we've lost?
Will the moon be shining as bright as before?
And as I'm singing this song
The tears well up in my eyes
And I will always wonder

Why I will never have
The life I wanted
Now I'm letting it go

'Cause I don't wanna hurt no more
No, I don't wanna make you
Go through one more rainy day
No, I don't wanna hurt no more

There's not much more to say
'Cause it's too late now
I won't hurt no more

So I wait till morning comes
He made it clear that
It has been only pain loving me
Things that we won't do for love
I am setting you free

'Cause I don't wanna hurt no more
No, I don't wanna make you
Go through one more rainy day
No, I don't wanna hurt no more

Strange enough I always knew
I'm taking off today
I am letting you go
