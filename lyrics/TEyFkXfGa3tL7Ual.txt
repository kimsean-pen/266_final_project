Hey ey
Every kiss is a door
Can I knock on yours? Can we knock a little more?
If your touch is a key
Keep on twistin', keep on lockin', keep on turnin' me

Let me in
I wanna be closer to you, let you under my skin
If I let you in
You gotta be careful with it
Let me tell you again (hey)

Love so soft, you ain't had nothin' softer
Break it then you buy it and it sure gonna cost ya
Love so soft that you can't rub off
You gon' love it if you try it
Got you hooked, now you're caught up

Love so soft, so soft (so soft)
Love so soft, so soft (so soft)

If your thought was the truth
We'd be doin' all the kinds of things I know you wanna do
But I need, need to know (need to know)
Will you protect me, respect me if I let you close?

Let (oh, let) me in (let me in, let me in)
I wanna be closer to you, let you under my skin
If I let (if I let) you in (let you in, let you in)
You gotta be careful with it
Let me tell you again (hey)

Love so soft, you ain't had nothin' softer
Break it then you buy it and it sure gonna cost ya
Love so soft that you can't rub off
You gon' love it if you try it
Got you hooked now you're caught up

Love so soft, so soft (so soft)
Love so soft, so soft (so soft)

If you want this love, gotta hold it tight
Never let it go, baby, let it give you life (give you life)
If you want this love, gotta hold it tight
Never let it go, baby, let it give you life

Love so soft, you ain't had nothin' softer
Break it then you buy it and it sure gonna cost ya
Love so soft that you can't rub off
You gon' love it if you try it
Got you hooked, now you're caught up
If you want this love (if you want), gotta hold it tight (if you want)
Never let it go, baby, let it give you life
(Love so soft) Love so soft
(Love so soft) Oh
If you want this love, gotta hold it tight
Never let it go, baby
C'mon love, c'mon, c'mon love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
If you want it baby
(Love so soft, yeah)
