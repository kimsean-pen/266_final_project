I found variety
On Nolan's Avenue
Down where the air is thick
As L.A. skies are blue
The water tried to break it down
But it held through
It gave a little for the sake of staying true

We cut ties
We tell lies
We hate change
And we want to claim where we feel
We take toes
We rake yours
Yeah we dig holes
And we're digging right in your fears

We're waking up
We're waking up
And right on time
And right on Time
We'll take these roads
We'll break them up
And right on time
And right on Time!

We got cars
We write laws
We won't pause
Don't you know we're always working this hard
We don't lose
We might bruise
Yeah but we'll rain fire on ya till you're playing
All of your cards

We're waking up
We're waking up
And right on time
And right on Time
We'll take these roads
We'll break them up
And right on time
And right on Time!
Break them up
Break them up
