Bring out your dead
I shout again
Will it ever end?
Rotting corpses everywhere
But I know how to transcend

Round and round, the bottle goes
Drown, drown all hope and sorrow

Mad men on the streets
Keep herding their sheep
High or low, we're all gonna go
Down at least for six feet

Round and round, the bottle goes
Drown, drown all hope and sorrow
Round and round, the bottle goes
Drown, drown all hope and sorrow

Like thunder in a pint
Divine truth I will find
Lifelong misery
It is not our destiny

Joy to the world, god is dead
So let's drink until the bitter end
Joy to the world, god is dead
So let's drink until the bitter end

They whip you with their made-up sins
They beat you until you finally give in
But know that there is another path
Filled with joy and not the grandeur of misery
Wake up and see
Drink with me
In our wanton harmony

Round and round, the bottle goes
Drown, drown all hope and sorrow
Round and round, the bottle goes
Drown, drown all hope and sorrow

Like thunder in a pint
Divine truth I will find
Lifelong misery
It is not our destiny

Joy to the world, god is dead
So let's drink until the bitter end
Joy to the world, god is dead
So let's drink until the bitter end

Joy to the world, god is dead
So let's drink until the bitter end
Joy to the world, god is dead
So let's drink until the bitter...
Bitter end
God is dead
Joy to the world, god is dead
