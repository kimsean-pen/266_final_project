I wish I could bubble wrap my heart
In case I fall and break apart
I'm not God, I can't change the stars
And I don't know if there's life on Mars

But I know you hurt the people that you love
And those who care for you
I want nothing to do with the things
That you're going through

This is the last time
I give up this heart of mine
I'm telling you that I'm a broken man
Who's finally realized

You're standing in moonlight
But you're black on the inside
Who do you think you are to cry?
This is goodbye

I'm a little dazed and confused
But life's a bitch and so are you
All my days are turned into nights
'Cause living without, without
Without you in my life

And you wrote the book
On how to be a liar
And lose all your friends
Did I mean nothing at all?
Was I just another ghost
That's been in your bed?

This is the last time
I give up this heart of mine
I'm telling you that I'm a broken man
Who's finally realized

You're standing in moonlight
But you're black on the inside
Who do you think you are to cry?
This is goodbye

Yeah, turn on the radio, honey
'Cause every single sad song
You'll be able to relate
This one I dedicate

Whoa, don't get all emotional, baby
You could never talk to me
You're unable to communicate

This is the last time
I give up this heart of mine
I'm telling you that I'm a broken man
Who's finally realized
This is the last time
I give up this heart of mine
I'm telling you that I'm a broken man
Who's finally realized
You're standing in moonlight
But you're black on the inside
Who do you think you are to cry?
This is goodbye
This is goodbye
