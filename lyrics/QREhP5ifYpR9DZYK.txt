I see your face drenched in sweat,
Freedom in death is what you need,
How blue is this lovely cat,
Overnight you start to bleed,
Spit your soul and go
Spit your soul and go
Spit your soul and go
Spit your soul and go

When you feel pain
I'll take your brain
And run away
Don't want to stay
See your suffering
In this one thing
I hear your shout
Please take me out
When you feel pain
I'll take your brain
And run away
Don't want to stay
See your suffering
In this one thing
I hear your shout
Please take me out
When you feel pain
I'll take your brain
And run away
Don't want to stay
See your suffering
In this one thing
I hear your shout
Please take me out

Broken ribs in the morning
You can eat them for dinner
Sudden misery is coming
You will never be a winner
Spit your soul and go
Leave your roe and go
Spit your soul and go
Leave your roe and go

When you feel pain
I'll take your brain
And run away
Don't want to stay
See your suffering
In this one thing
I hear your shout
Please take me out

When you feel pain
I'll take your brain
And run away
Don't want to stay
See your suffering
In this one thing
I hear your shout
Please take me out
