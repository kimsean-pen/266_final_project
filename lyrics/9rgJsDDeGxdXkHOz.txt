You are going down
You are going down
You are going down

Down, at the bottom, I have found
I cannot wait to get back in the fight
And send you straight to the ground

Hide and seeking when I'm on the ropes
You wanna knock me down, knock me out
Your cheap shots are denied

You're going down now
You can't kill my soul and kill my dream
Kill my soul and kill my dream
You can't kill my soul and kill my dream
Back down

You are going down
You are going down
You are going down

Now, you will understand me now
You don't want to come back to the fight
I've been the underdog all my life

I can feel it, I will not stop
Until I see you down on the ground
'Cause I am still alive

You're going down now
You can't kill my soul and kill my dream
Kill my soul and kill my dream
You can't kill my soul and kill my dream
Back down

You can't kill my soul and kill my dream
Kill my soul and kill my dream
You can't kill my soul and kill my dream

You are going down
You are going down
You are going down
You are going down

You can't kill my soul, kill my dream
You are going down
You can't kill my soul, kill my dream
You are going down

You can't kill my soul, kill my dream
You are going down
You can't kill my soul, kill my dream
You are going down

You are going down
You are going down
You are going down
You are going down
