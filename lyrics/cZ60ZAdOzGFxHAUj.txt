Beautiful Tango, take me by the hand
Beautiful Tango, until you make me dance
How sweet it can be, if you make me dance?
How long will it last, baby if we dance?

Come to the, come to the world
Come to the, come to the world
And baby let me show you things
'Cause time is running and we can lose
Baby come and dance we gonna make it through
'Cause we've got time
Yes, we've got time

Beautiful stranger, don't want to know your name
Beautiful stranger, just take me by the hand
'Cause how sweet it can be, if you make me dance?
How long will it last, oh baby if we dance?

Come to the place where the skin speaks
The secret words in Spanish
Where the night turns out the light of day
For us to show some courage

So don't go, if you wanna know
Don't go, if you don't know
Don't go, if you wanna know
Don't go, don't go, don't go

Beautiful stranger, take me by the hand
Make me dance all night
I wanna take the chance.
'Cause I love the way you move,
And the way you,
Put your hands on my hips are moving while you take it slow
Makes me feel like I'm on a river flow.
Cause we've got time,
And yes, we've got time

Beautiful stranger, I wanna lose my mind
Beautiful stranger, in the danger of your arms, oh oh oh oh
Beautiful stranger, I want to lose myself
Beautiful stranger, in the danger of your arms

Tripping on
Tripping on
Tripping on you baby

Tripping on
Tripping on
Tripping on you

Tripping on you baby
Got me tripping on you now, now, now
