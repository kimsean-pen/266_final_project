I lost my way, oh baby, this stray heart
Went to another, can you recover, baby?
Oh, you're the only one that I'm dreamin' of
Your precious heart was torn apart by me and you

You're not alone, oh, and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone, oh, I'll hold your heart and never let go

Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just can't have you

I said a thousand times and now a thousand one
We'll never part, I'll never stray again from you
This dog is destined for a home to your heart
We'll never part, I'll never stray again from you

You're not alone, oh, and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone, oh, I'll hold your heart and never let go

Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just can't have you

You're not alone, oh, and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone, oh, I'll hold your heart and never let go

Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just can't have you

Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just, just can't have you
