Oh sailor
Oh sail me
Silver mast do impale me
Oh windless
Oh windy
Remind me
Rewind me
Oh laughter
Oh laughless
Just sing this
Just mean this
Infinity whispered to me
A mumble so dreamy
A soft sound so creamy
So dreamy
Dreamy
Infinity whispered to me
A mumble so dreamy
A soft sound so creamy
So dreamy
So dreamy
So dreamy
