I've been led on
To think that we've been
Trying for too long.
Every time we drift
We're forcing what is wrong.
At last that voice is gone.
Please take your time
But you've got to know that
I am taking sight.
Oh, you look good
with your patient face and wandering eye
Don't hold this war inside.
Come back when you can.
Let go, you'll understand.
You've done nothing at all to make me love you less.
So come back when you can.
You left your home
You're so far from
Everything you know
Your big dream is
Crashing down and out your door.
Wake up and dream once more.
Come back when you can.
Let go, you'll understand.
You've done nothing at all to make me love you less.
So come back when you can.
Come back, I'll help you stand.
Let go and hold my hand.
If all you wanted was me, I'd give you nothing less.
So come back when you can
