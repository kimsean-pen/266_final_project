I wanted you to know
I wanted you to know
I wanted you to know
Beginning time is through
and the younger years are too
the younger tears are too
drying up slow
drying up slow
the cut on thicker skin
famous questions from within
I wonder
Can I hear the heart beat?
Tell me if the heart beats,
if the heart beats
How much longer
God will surround me
Tell me when will that be?
When will that be?
and I wonder
Can I hear the heart beat?
Tell me if the heart beats
if the heart beats
