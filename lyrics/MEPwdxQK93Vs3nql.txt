Sacred fall, I forgive nothing
Weathered hands keeping me still
Bleaching the fluorescent lights, sing to the dead
Ransom the last of the meat, you'd never love enough

Pressing, vibrant running down the stairs
Fire off the warning shot so everyone's aware
Fragments dance upon the ledge
High above the sleeping giant circling the edge

Sacrifice, I recall loving
Crows feet eyes keeping me alive
Sent to the gallows to see if you could believe it all
Ransom the last of the meat, you'd never love enough

Overwhelm, I've been seeing extra light
You'll be sorry, even if you have to fight

Pressing, blood shot a million miles away
Tamper with the sleeping giant laughing all the way
Promise running down your leg
Who will sound the mourning bell so everyone's awake?
