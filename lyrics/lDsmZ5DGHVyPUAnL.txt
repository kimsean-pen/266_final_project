Excuse me but can I be you for a while?
My dog won't bite if you sit real still
I got the Anti-Christ in the kitchen yellin' at me again
Yeah, I can hear that

Been saved again by the garbage truck
I got something to say you know
But nothing comes
Yes, I know what you think of me, you never shut-up
Yeah, I can hear that

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it?
Hey, but I don't care
'Cause sometimes
I said sometimes
I hear my voice
And it's been
Here
Silent all these years

So you found a girl
Who thinks really deep thoughts
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts?
Boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon
How's that thought for you?

My scream got lost in a paper cup
Do you think there's a heaven
Where some screams have gone?
I got twenty five bucks and a cracker
Do you think it's enough
To get us there?

'Cause what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his
With her name still on it?
Hey, but I don't care
'Cause sometimes
I said sometimes
I hear my voice
And it's been
Here
Silent all these

Years go by
Will I still be waiting
For somebody else to understand?
Years go by
If I'm stripped of my beauty
And the orange clouds
Raining in my head
Years go by
Will I choke on my tears
'Til finally there is nothing left?
One more casualty
You know we're too easy, easy, easy

Well, I love the way we communicate
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
Let's hear what you think of me now
But, baby, don't look up
The sky is falling

Your mother shows up in a nasty dress
And it's your turn now to stand where I stand
Everybody lookin' at you, here
Take hold of my hand
Yeah, I can hear them

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of yours
With her name still on it?
Hey, but I don't care
'Cause sometimes
I said sometimes
I hear my voice
I hear my voice
I hear my voice
And it's been
Here
Silent all these years
I've been here
Silent all these years
Silent all these
Silent all these years
