Bad boy

Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So so many things I could've done
But clouds

Angel dust gets in your eyes, your hair
On acid stars you're getting there
My body's assembled into
A little itty-bitty gift to you
When you die, I've looked at life that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
So, so don't let them inside, don't let them know
Don't give yourself ohh away

But now my friends are acting strange
They shake their heads man, they say I've changed, well
Well, something's lost, rearranged
From living every, every, every, I've

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
I'ts just illusions I recall

I really don't know, I really don't know
I really don't know, I really don't know
I really don't, I really don't clouds at all
Why are we here... terrified, terrified, wow
