I wanna be known
As the girl who's stone cold
Wears her heart on her sleeve
For everyone to need
Oh she'll make you proud
You'll like her for now

I get scared instead, when you say
"you've been in my head", let that stay
I wish I could hurry home
Hurry home
I better hurry home
Hurry home
I don't owe anything to anyone

I'm getting tired of having to explain myself
I shouldn't have to tell
You know I think I'm grown
And no I won't sustain myself

Don't you know I'm not selfish
Don't you dare say that to me
If you dare say that to me you'll see

Don't you dare say that to me
If you dare say that to me you'll see
