I lived out more than a little,
give my insides out til there's nothing left to see
stepped down, left in the middle of the mess you made
the mess I used to be
so give me love
give me every little bit of your broken heart
my heart skips a beat
so give me love, give me love love love
my insides out, there's nothing left to see

now I needed to find, now I needed to find out on my own
I needed to find, now I needed to find out on my own

from my head all the way to my feet
strange is what I've become
would you ask for a little more of me
why can't I find it?

empty, where my heart used to be
now I'm looking in the mirror, I see this monster that is me

...more than a little
just to watch you bleed leave broken words behind
give me love, give me love love love
insides out, til there's nothing left to see

now I needed to find, now I needed to find out on my own
I needed to find, now I needed to find out on my own

from my head all the way to my feet
strange what I've become
would you ask for a little more of me
why can't I find it?

empty, where my heart used to be
now I'm looking in the mirror, I see this monster that is me

now I needed to find, now I need to find out on my own
I needed to find, now I needed to find out on my own
now I needed to find, now I need to find out on my own
now I needed to find, now I needed to find out on my own
on my own, on my own, on my own...

from my head all the way to my feet
strange what I've become
would you ask for a little more of me
why can't I find it?

empty, where my heart used to be
now I'm looking in the mirror, I see this monster that is me
