Baby says I can't come with him.
And I had read all of this
in his eyes.
Long before he even said so,
Why go? I asked.
You know,
and I know why.

And it'll be just as quiet
when I leave
as it was
when I first got here.
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything...

Take care.
I've been hurt before.
Too much time spent
on closing doors.
You may hate me,
but I'll remember to love you.
Goodbye,
don't cry.
You know why.

And it'll be just as quiet
when I leave
as it was
when I first got here.
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything...

All the waves of blame arrange as broken scenery,
As they steal your best memories away.
What if I was someone different in your only history?
Would you feel the same
as I walk out the door?

Never to see your face again;
Never to see your face again.

And it'll be just as quiet
when I leave
as it was
when I first got here.
It'll be just
as quiet,
when I leave
as it was
when I first got here.
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything
to change
when I leave.
