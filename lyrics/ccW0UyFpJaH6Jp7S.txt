She's only 18
Don't like the Rolling Stones
She took a short cut
To being fully grown

She's got that mood ring
A little sister rose
The smell of Springsteen
A pair of pantyhose

This talking picture show
Is leaking from a silhouette
She said my man you know
It's time to get your fingers wet

Your hustle's busted when
You can't afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you
Were you screaming "handle it"

(Knock the world)
Right off its feet and straight onto its head
(The book of love)
Will long be laughing after you are dead

(Fascinated)
By the look of yound what was said
(Make a play)
For all the brightest minds and light will shed

I heard some P-Funk
Out on the road again
To get your head shrunk
Is what I recommend

It's in your bloodline
A perfect Frankenstein
Out on that lone pine
I'm gonna make you mine

It's understood you wrap
Your voodoo right around my neck
You've got some glitter on your
Kitty at the discotheque

I put my lovin' in your oven
Not a head to check
The last I heard from you
Were you screaming "resurrect"

(Knock the world)
Right off it's feet and straight onto it's head
(The book of love)
Will long be laughing after you are dead

(Fascinated)
By the look of you and what was said
(Make a play)
For all the brightest minds and light will shed

(Knock the world)
Right off its feet and straight onto its head
(The book of love)
Will long be laughing after you are dead

(Fascinated)
By the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the
Brightest minds and light will shed
