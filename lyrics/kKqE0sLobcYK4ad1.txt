Silence in the room
But I still hear your voice
I've been awake all night
My heart is aching for you

Blinded by the light
I cannot see the answers
Here with open arms
My heart is waiting for you

How much this is gonna hurt?
You promise you'll never tell a lie
Don't tell me it's over
Even in the end I feel alive

I did trust your words
But I don't trust your actions
Walk on broken glass
The chemical reaction

Burn baby
I will shut the door and hide the key
Burn baby
Give you a taste of your own medicine
Time to break free

I'm alive
