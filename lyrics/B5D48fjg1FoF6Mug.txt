All that I did was walk over
Start off by shaking your hands
That's how it went
I had a smile on my face
And I sat up straight

Ooh, yeah, yeah
I wanted to know you
I wanted to show you

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way
You'd just shut me out
Make me go away

(I'm so unwanted)
No, I just don't understand why?
You won't talk to me
It hurts
I'm so unwanted for nothing
Don't talk words against me
I wanted to know you
I wanted to show you

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way
You'd just shut me out
Make me go away
Make me go away

I tried to be long
It didn't seem wrong
My head aches
It's been so long
I write this song
That's what it takes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way
You'd just shut me out
Make me go away

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way
You'd just shut me out
Make me go away
Make me go away
Make me go away
