Wheeeeeeen I had you (had you)

I treated you baaaaaaad and wrong my dear
And girl since, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's lovin' you
I, I, I, I should have never, ever,

Ever made you cry
And and girl since, since you been gone
Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's lovin' you
Life with out love, huh...
It's oh so lonely
I don't think, I don't think! I'm gonna make it
All my life, all my life baby yeah I've been lost to you only
Come on & take it girl
Come on & take it, because...
All, all I can do, all I can do since you've been gone is cry
And don't you ever wonder or worry your head of what I do

Who's loving you

I, I, I gotta know yea

I, I, I, I, I wonder
Older brother singing in backgrond:

Who's loving you
Oh! oh! oh!
Oh, yeah
