You are still my brother
Till the end of time
You and I we lost our way
Differences of mind
Till the end of time

Listen to me Brother
I can't take your place
No one else can wear your face
That's the work of grace
Till the end of time

And here is my problem

Hey, I think you got me wrong
I am sorry for the riches that I found
I didn't mean no harm
So tell me where you're bound
You're welcome in my town
But if you try to force my compass 'round
I'm gonna stand you down

You are still my brother
Till the end of time
No one else can take your place
Difference is divine
Till the end of time

And here is my problem

Hey, I think you got me wrong
I am sorry for the riches I took home
I know I crossed a line
But show me what you've found
You're welcome in my town
But if you try to force my compass 'round
I'm gonna stand you down

Till the end of time
