camera kiss
affix another smile
bends my ears where i stay a while
all i know
this town can feel so small

i need to stretch my legs
find some big mistakes
find some big mistakes

dream maker takes another sip
starts a file through her fingertips and tiptoe[?]
falling into light

oh it seems like truth
i could fall for you
i could fall for you

you've got the eyes of them all
you're just dancing on your own
you've got the eyes of them all
you're just dancing on your own
dancing on your own

she stuck in circles
start to feel her words
float on past without being heard
i'm awash[?]
poured out into night

i'll keep my eyes holding on to hers
holding on to hers

you've got the eyes of them all
you're just dancing on your own
you've got the eyes of them all
you're just dancing on your own
you've got the eyes of them all
you're just dancing on your own
you've got the eyes of them all
you're just dancing on your own
dancing on your own

i want another so that i can breathe
deep in the cracks when she finally leaves
