What was that?
You sound deserted
Lost and alone
The world around you has gone perverted
Don't be afraid
This is what you've been saving for
Everything that you've done
Nothing seems to be what it's worth

I am really all that I've been looking for
It really doesn't matter so why try anymore
Just keep on searching
And I'll be uncertain
Your life will only be just what you want it for

Been around the world
Seen my share of existence
Smoked too much
An infidel for commitments
All over now
All as if it's just a beginning
My friends have come and gone
But you're still here and my head's spinning

I am really all that I've been looking for
It really doesn't matter so why try anymore
Just keep on searching
And I'll be uncertain
Your life will only be just what you want it for (x6)
