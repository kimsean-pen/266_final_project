Just let me say
One thing
I've had enough
You're selfish
And sorry
You'll never learn

How to love
As your world disassembles
Better keep your
Head up

Your name
Your face
Is all you have left now
Betrayed
Disgraced
You've been erased...
So long

So long
I have erased you!
So long
So long
I've wanted to
Waste you!

So long
So long
I have erased you
I have escaped

The Bitter Taste
Of you!
Just let me
Clear my head
I think I've
Had too much
You're so

Dissappointing

But you make
Good use of it
As your world disassembles
Better keep your

Head up
Your name
Your face
Is all you have left now
Betrayed
Disgraced
You've been erased...
So long

So long
I have erased you!
So long
So long
I've wanted to
Waste you!
So long
So long
I have erased you
I have escaped
The Bitter Taste
Of you!

The Bitter Taste
Of you!
