Driving down this road doing something bad
Every time I think we're through, you pull me back
Yeah you leave me lonely
Every time you hold me

Mama taught me better than to love like that
Cause I know this love is gonna be fatal
But I shut my mouth before I say no
One thing I'm addicted to is being on the edge with you
And I can't can't get enough

Love me love me like bulletproof
Love me love me like bulletproof
When I do the things that I shouldn't do
Love me love me

Love me love me like bulletproof
Love me love me like bulletproof
When I do the things that I shouldn't do
Love me love me

I made you give up drinking and your cigarettes
Cause I'm the best addiction that you'll ever have
A gun on my finger
So I pull the trigger
Didn't Papa tell you not to love like that
Cause I know this love is gonna be fatal
But I kiss your lips before you say no
I can get accustomed to playing all these games with you
Cause I just can't get enough

Love me love me like bulletproof
Love me love me like bulletproof
When I do the things that I shouldn't do
Love me, love me

Love me love me like bulletproof
Love me love me like bulletproof
When I do the things that I shouldn't do
Love me love me

Love me

I've been drinking
I've been drinking way too much
Got me drowning in your love
You've got me drowning

I've been thinking
I've been thinking of your touch
Got your feelings all messed up
and I hate myself

Cause I know this love's gonna be fatal
But I shut my mouth before I say no
One thing I'm addicted to is being on the edge with you

Cause I just can't get enough but you
Love me love me like bulletproof
When I do the things that I shouldn't do
Love me love me

Love me love me like bulletproof
Love me love me like bulletproof
When I do the things that I shouldn't do
Love me love me

Love me

THE END
