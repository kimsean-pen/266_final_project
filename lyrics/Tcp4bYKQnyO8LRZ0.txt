White light doorway here I am in the flesh again
Does this make you wanna see me here again?
I'll shout, I'll scream, I'll walk back but you'll bring me in
White light doorway please spare me, please forgive my sins

Golden flowers metal diamonds on the wall
I've not been there, I've not been here
Please come quick, I've stuck my head in the banister again
I've slid and pulled and chafed my neck and I'm freaking out
Please come quick, I've stuck my head in the banister again
But I just wanted to know what it would feel like
With one part of my body alive
With one part of my body alive
