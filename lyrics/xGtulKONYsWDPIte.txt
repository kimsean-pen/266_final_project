Spoken sideways and indirect
Without a single word left unchecked
And by your own admission no one is ever above suspicion
Defenses never to be let down
The lies readily abound, gaping jaw tightly wound

In your desolation
Still searching for nowhere
Desolation
You're living in nowhere

Smoking gun, cause and effect
Paradise lost, a beautiful wreck
And to you I solemnly swear
All I ever wanted was away from here
All that for nothing, what a fucking waste of time
I only took what was rightfully mine
Seek and you shall find

In your desolation
Still searching for nowhere
Desolation
You're living in nowhere

The dying man might take you with him
Until then I'll split the difference
All that for nothing, what a fucking waste of time

(I'm gonna take what is rightfully mine)

Desolation
Desolation

In your desolation
Still searching for nowhere
Desolation
You're living in nowhere

(All that for nothing, what a fucking waste of time)
(All that for nothing, what a fucking waste of time)

The dying man might take you with him
I swear to you I'll split the difference
All that for nothing, what a fucking waste of time (desolation)
