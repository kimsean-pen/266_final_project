It's that one type of night with the bright white ice pick
Slipped up signature, wrestle till I scribble shit
Who in my space smell khaki leather pants?
If my brain go missin' I'll be damned

The one ripped by the wind, instant implant
How we see what we thought was nothing before
Now the lost and the waste can slide behind them
Perform the custom of hissing lisp adorn

I've had a little bit too much
Don't wait for me, I'll wake up on my own tomorrow
I took a little medicine love to lubricate my flow
Don't wait up for me cuz I'll be coming home tomorrow

I'll crush a mound up on your birthday cake
With your whole family there watching or at your Aunt Viv's wake
Line up some blow on your titties and blow the rest in your face
If you're not turning up then your whole life's a disgrace
I like the self-destructive girls, where the fucks be all missin'
When you're home and I'm high I don't wanna hear no bitchin'
This is the modern man, modern plan, future transition
Worship the work and the product
American Joy Division

I know them and I know what
I think Imma start this up
(Eagle vs. crows)
We all suck, we were born to fuck this up
I know them and I know what
I think Imma start this up
(Eagle vs. crows)
We all suck, we were born to fuck this up

Take the fastest object overgrowth
Like a basket lobbin egg and yolk
I got the bombest little habit watch my head explode
Like the plant lion synthesized this shit

I've had a little bit too much
Don't wait for me, I'll wake up on my own tomorrow
I took a little medicine love to lubricate my flow
Don't wait up for me cuz I'll be coming home tomorrow
