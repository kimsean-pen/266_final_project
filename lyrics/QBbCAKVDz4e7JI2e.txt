Got into a bit of a state last night
Deleted every contact in my life
Built a fire in my mind, went back inside

The consequence is coming
I still have yet to learn
That every little bit
Helps the fire burn

It doesn't get worse, it doesn't get better
You just get old, it lasts forever
Can't get happy, can't get sad
It's hard to do

When I hate everyone but you
Everyone but you
It's hard to do
When I hate everyone but you
Everyone but you

I fell in love
'Cause no one saw me the way you did
And no one's seen me that way since
But for a short time that's how I lived

Can't get happy, can't get sad
It's hard to do

When I hate everyone but you
Everyone but you
It's hard to do
When I hate everyone but you
Everyone but you

I stay home
Just to get locked in different rooms
It's the presence that you feel
I swear it holds some type of truth

Can't get happy, can't get sad
It's hard to do

When I hate everyone but you
Everyone but you
It's hard to do
When I hate everyone but you
Everyone but you

When I hate everyone but you
Everyone but you
It's hard to do
When I hate everyone but you
