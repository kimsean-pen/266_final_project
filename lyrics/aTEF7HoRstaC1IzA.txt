So cold inside my heart
falling on ice in the dark
star lights the sky but I
can't see through frozen eyes

Come to me
I'm on my way, my dear
Between our hearts
there's only snow

Come to me
I'm on my way, my dear
Between our hearts
there's only

snowflakes that cover my
mouth sings
for no one to hear
my thoughts
imagining summer
imagining

Come to me
I'm on my way, my dear
Between our hearts
there's only snow

Come to me
I'm on my way, my dear
Between our hearts
there's only snow

Goodbye
Away, away
Weekend
we'll meet again
though time
is slower now
