I am scorn in this heavenly scheme
With a stench of destruction
I'm a reaper of beautiful dreams
And she knows I'm on the edge, sacrilege!

[Whispers] Push, please push me over

Tell me once upon a time
I close my eyes and see myself reborn
[Choir] Righting the wrong
I won't stay to stand in line
Or wait for God to shine all over me
I wait for the storm

I am you and I know that you heard
You and I are the last at the end of the world
then we talk and we run and we hide
then so what
the human race suffocates

[Whispers] Leave me breathless

Tell me once upon a time
I close my eyes and see myself reborn
[Choir] Righting the wrong
I won't stay to stand in line
Or wait for God to shine all over me
I wait for the storm
I wait for the storm
I wait for the storm

Move along
Through the ashes of a dream
Move along
I see myself anew again

Tell me once upon a time
I close my eyes and see myself reborn
[Choir] Righting the wrong
I won't stay to stand in line
Or wait for God to shine all over me
I wait for the storm
