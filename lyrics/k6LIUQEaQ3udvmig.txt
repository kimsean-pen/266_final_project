late at night
sometimes i can't seem to fight
the thought of you out my mind
years ago summertime

cigarettes
the taste of your whiskey lips
still haunting my every kiss
do you remember it?

i just wanna be
in your memory
wild and carefree
like we used to be

and if i go home
will you come around like when we were young
tell me that you always kinda missed me
wishin' we could still be 18

and if i come back
take me to the places that we talked at
oh, i can't forget the way you kissed me
wishin' we could still be 18

even now
i wonder when you're in town
yeah, maybe we could go down
take a walk along the silent sound

keep you close
i don't want to let you go
your memory's in my soul
thought i should let you know

i just wanna be
like we used to be

and if i go home
will you come around like when we were young
tell me that you always kinda missed me
wishin' we could still be 18

and if i come back
take me to the places that we talked at
oh, i can't forget the way you kissed me
wishin' we could still be 18

i know you were just a glimmer
i don't even know if you ever
think about the days we spent together

i know you were just a glimmer
i don't even know if you ever
think about the days we spent together

and if i go home
will you come around like when we were young
tell me that you always kinda missed me
wishin' we could still be 18

and if i come back
take me to the places that we talked at
oh, i can't forget the way you kissed me
wishin' we could still be 18
