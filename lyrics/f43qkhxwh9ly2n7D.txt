Lost on words for you
And I'd better make it soon
In a world for you
And the better one you are

And I'm turning off
To a place that you don't know
And I'm turning off here
To a place I know
I know, I know, I know

Lost on words for you
And I'd better make it soon
In a world for you
And the better one you are

And I'm turning off
To a place that you don't know
And I'm turning off here
To a place I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
