900 degrees with a bitch on her knees
Run up in the house
Whole squad black tees
That's a lick
Hit 'em when I want
Break in through the front
Call me $lick
Got a loaded pump in case you wanna jump
Just another bitch on my dick ridin' in the Chevy
Just another chick loving $lick tryna give me becky
Gotta grip with a loaded clip
Tell me is you with me?
Lunatic with no motive bitch smoking on some Whitney
Bobby Brown, hope no cops around but fuck 'em if they are
Pig killer mixed with gorilla
We the Lords of Chaos
See these mother fuckers can't touch me
Run up bitch I'm clutching
30 shots I'm dumping
In that bitch boy you fucking

This love between you and I
As simple as pie baby
This love between you and I
As simple as pie baby
This love between you and I
As simple as pie baby
This love between you and I
As simple as pie baby

66 bitch
You can bet I'm on the shit list
Dope sick
Fix your slip
Spit with my whole fist
No tricks
Goal kicks
No toe licks
Spit pole cold
Rich assholes shit gold bricks
Stick with show business
Your record gets more skips then a lunch line
Sometimes punch lines are played out all about hump fine bitches
Hitting switches
Getting riches
Fucking one time was enough
I'm from the motherfucking underground
We don't slip
Independent ripping off pendants and sending it to your bitch
So she can reminisce about the time I slipped her the dick
I mean she fucking asked for it
What the fuck do you want me to do?
Ruby da Cherry da Mixed Berry fucking smoothie so smooth

This love between you and I
As simple as pie baby
This love between you and I
As simple as pie baby
This love between you and I
