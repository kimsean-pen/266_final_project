I am the earthworm
I live underground
I am the earthworm
I live in the dark
I am the earthworm
I live off decay
I am the earthworm
And no one sees me
Ever
The forces of dynasty are laughed at in the street
Our teachers hide behind their lies
But we've got the vision to see
You waste your time running from one book to the next
and when you stand in front of the mirror
I might get some rest
The chief looks back into the dark
and no one cares to follow
Lovers wait behind the phones
Praying there's no mistakes
the city is made of concrete and stone
But we hide in the cracks
And the insects crawl through the dark
knowing nothing, nothing sees them
