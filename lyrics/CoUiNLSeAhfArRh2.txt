night time - turning out the sun
countdown - pulsing like a machine
conflict - cars and people, steel on flesh
night time - desperations sweat on breath
bloodstains - night covering the crimes
daytime - shows the face behind the mask
showtime - law and order life and death
funtime - a drunken time where all can lie
come, come with me, we'll run into the night
come, come and see, sweet madness of night
night time - party troops and governments
clubtime - lovers riches promises
no time - running hiding crying tears
it's night time - and time to run from all your fears
come, come with me, we'll run into the night
come, come and see, sweet madness of night
night time, night time
night time, night time
