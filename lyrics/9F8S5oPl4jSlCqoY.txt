Down the machines, dont have the answers
oh i've been looking for those bad boys since day one
one blade of grass in a field of dancers
oh i've searched for every reason and found none
take me on an adventure
let it be a golden one
i dont know much about the weather so meet me in the morning sun
moments will come but not in patterns
oh ive written it all down and i've not looked once
close your eyes and it might not happen
oh the mountains will be standing when we're done
so take me on an adventure
let it be a golden one
i dont care much about the weather
so meet me in the morning sun
oh your eyes and soul no one belongs to you
i listen to the words but no words will ever do
so take me on an adventure
let it be a golden one
i dont know much about the weather
so meet me in the morning sun
take me on an adventure
let it be a golden one
i dont know much about the weather
so meet me in the morning sun
