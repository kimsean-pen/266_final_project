Can you see me? Am I still here?
Tell me not to give in
Can you hear me?
Is it time to walk again to that place in silence?
Go back to the shadows
Back to the shadows

Can they heal me?
Can they help me be myself once again?
Can they?
Am I dreaming? Am I feeling love or is this just consolation?
I'm begging the devil
To feed me venom

There's a silhouette beside me, cutting tangles of my hair
Will this lunacy allow me to remember who I am?
The reflection on the mirror shows me eyes that cannot see
And I'm trapped inside illusion, severed from reality

In my head it ain't over
I surrender and give in to delusion deep within
It's in my head, taking over
And the only voice I hear is a prayer for release
All these pieces do not fit in my cosmic self
Overthinking everything
Inconvenient, unexpected sounds that call
For my strained reaction
My own occupier
Reset and rewire

There's a silhouette that haunts me and I know I can't be saved
As the shapes are moving closer and my sanity derails
The reflection on the mirror shows me eyes that cannot see
And the calling of a vision alters my reality

In my head it ain't over
I surrender and give in to delusion deep within
It's in my head, taking over
And the only voice I hear is a prayer for release
And I won't live in this sorrow
With no reason to get by
When divided from your light
No I won't live, I'll stay hollow
Without chance to reunite
While I'm driven to the night
You were pushed into a sidetrack, never to remain
You had every intention to leave with grace
When you're lying on your bed and descending into doubt
I just hope your light will still keep me warm
