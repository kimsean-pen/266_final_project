Something about the way she's wearing
Her dress a little tighter
Something about the way she's staring
She's looking to start a fire

Something about the way she's dancing
And drinking chilled Patron
If she's lonely now, she won't be lonely long

Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It's too late, too bad, she's too far gone
He should have thought of that before he left her all alone
If she's lonely now, she won't be lonely long

Something about the way she's blushing
You can tell she isn't sure
Let you know she's up to something
She's never done before

Tonight she wants to hold a stranger
But not the one at home
If she's lonely now, she won't be lonely long

Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It's too late, too bad, she's too far gone
He should have thought of that before he left her all alone
If she's lonely now, she won't be lonely long

If I had a woman like that, man, I'd let her know
I'd hold her tight, I'd hold her close
Do anything, do everything to let her know
She'd never, ever be alone

Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It's too late, too bad, she's too far gone
He should have thought of that before he left her all alone
If she's lonely now, Lord, if she's lonely now
If she's lonely now, she won't be lonely long
