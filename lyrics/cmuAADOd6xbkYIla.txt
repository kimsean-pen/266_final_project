There are no rewards for consuming the wounded
Starved for an easy kill, keep your hunger at bay
I will use your flesh to keep her warm

God would break character if he could for a chance to spit in your face
Guardian angels couldn't keep you safe from me

With my last breath, I will strangle you to death with your own fucking hands

I will make my peace removing the arms of unrepentant thieves
