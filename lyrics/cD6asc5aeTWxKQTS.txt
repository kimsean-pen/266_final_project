Lights turned way down low and music is soft and slow
With someone you love so
That's where it's at
Yeah

Your world turned upside down
You're making not a sound
No one else around
That's where it's at
Yeah

Let me tell
Your heart beating fast
You're knowing that time will pass but a-hoping that it lasts

That's where it's at
Oh
Yeah
That's where it's at
Pretty baby
That's where it's at
Oh
Yes
It is
That's where it's at pretty baby
That's where it's at
Oh
Yeah

Let me tell just one thing
To say it's time to go and she says "Yes I know"
But stay just one minute more

That's where it's at pretty baby
That's where it's at
I know that's where it's at
That's where it's at pretty baby
That's where it's at
