Say that you mean it
Whisper to me all night long
Chicks are getting hot on the fire
You want that rock and roll

Dancing where you want to
Shake that sugar right on my bone
Breathing heavy on my telephone
You want that rock and roll
Save it for the judge now, it's on the radio

Sugar on the bone now
Shaking your tits
Hit you like thunder
You got that hold on me

Come a little closer
Kiss the ring and kneel at the throne
Show me what you do when you're alone
You want that rock and roll

'Cause that's the way you need to
Know you been a bad, bad girl
Two for one sale on the world
You want that rock and roll
Save it for the judge now, it's on the radio

Sugar on the bone now
Shaking your tits
Hit you like thunder
You got that hold on me

Sugar on the bone now
Shaking your tits
Hit you like thunder
You got that hold on me
Sugar on the bone now
Shaking your tits
Hit you like thunder
You got that hold on me
