One is the Axis
Anonymous in glory
Love is now empty
And incomplete

Strike at the heart of hope
Where panic stirs the will
We hear Dog's blessing
This sleepless night's torture
We pray for it's ending
We push for the slaughter
Of a broken faith missing
Of a passing love dying
We start afresh
For love and for death

One is the Axis
Anonymous in glory
Love is now empty
Forever, incomplete
