I've got your number
I don't know how long I can wait
(oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh)
To call you over
So we can waste the night away
(oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh)
When the lights go out
We're getting up
We go where we go
We do what we want
Do want we want
We'll be the colour in
All this black and white
Are you feeling what I'm feeling
'Cause it's really feeling right
Don't wake me if I'm dreaming
I could stay here all night
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it coming true
I can feel it
I can feel it
When I'm looking at you
Are you feeling what I'm feeling
'Cause i'm really feeling fine
Kicking bottles under bleachers
And we're hiding from the light
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it coming true
I can feel it
I can feel it
When I'm looking at you
My head is spinning
I don't know how much I can take
(oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh)
No fortune teller
I guess we'll leave this up to fate
(oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh)
When the lights go out
We're getting up
We go where we go
We do what we want
Do what we want
Say you'll remember
Singing 'Forever Young'
Are you feeling what I'm feeling
'Cause it's really feeling right
Don't wake me if I'm dreaming
I could stay here all night
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it coming true
I can feel it
I can feel it
When I'm looking at you
Are you feeling what I'm feeling
'Cause i'm really feeling fine
Kicking bottles under bleachers
And we're hiding from the light
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it coming true
I can feel it
I can feel it
When I'm looking at you
(oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh)
Can you feel it
(oh oh oh oh)
Can you feel it
(oh oh oh oh)
Can you feel it
(oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh)
Are you feeling what I'm feeling
'Cause it's really feeling right
Don't wake me if I'm dreaming
I could stay here all night
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it coming true
I can feel it
I can feel it
When I'm looking at you
Are you feeling what I'm feeling
'Cause i'm really feeling fine
Kicking bottles under bleachers
And we're hiding from the light
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it coming true
I can feel it
I can feel it
When I'm looking at you
