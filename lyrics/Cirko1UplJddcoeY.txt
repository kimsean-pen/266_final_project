I disappear
I lost control
My body's moving
on it's own
I watch myself
Walk away
A foreign spirit
took my place

An empty stare
its eyes are dull
So my essence
It's riding my pulse

A burst of black
A breath of smoke
I disappeared
I lost control

I
I disappear
I disappear
I disappear

I disappear
I lost control
My body's moving
on it's own
I watch myself
Walk away
A foreign spirit
took my place

I
I disappear
I disappear
I disappear

How could I resist
It's all I've wanted
Now I guess I've got it
Why it happened, I don't know
Hope this doesn't last forever

I disappear
I disappear
I disappear
I disappear
