Don't disturb the beast
The tempermental
Goat, the snail
While he's feeding on

The rose
Stay frozen
Compromise what
I will, I am

Bend around the wind
Silently
Thrown about
Again I'm treading so

Soft and
Lightly
Compromising my
Will, I am

I am, I will
So no longer
Will I lay down
Play dead, play your doe

In the headlights locked down and terrified
Your deer in the headlights shot down and horrified
When push comes to pull comes to shove
Comes to step around this
Self-destructing dance that never would've ended till I

Rose
And I
Roared aloud here
I will, I am

I am, I will
So no longer
Will I lay down
Lay dead, play this
Kneel down, gun-shy
Martyr, pitiful
I rose and I roared
I will, I am
