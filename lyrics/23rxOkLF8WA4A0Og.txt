Foreseen the future coming dismal, regret
Selfish disposition, paybacks in order promptly
Power, control the means of commerce, dictate
Restrict those who try to flourish, unaided nihilist
Predict, choose who suffers largely, downfall
Invade, no private profits tolerable, contain dissent
Sharing the wealth with those who rule you, divine
Restraint, the sermon lectured to you, frequent rhetoric

Taxing only the rich, but they define, what rich is
Guardianship a must, regardless of your net worth
Bailouts reign in all, manipulate, enduring crowd
Relentless revolt crushed, just fall in line, must obey
All but killing the dream, that's in the past, nothing lasts
Boundaries in line, unyielding law

Prosperity as a whole, oppressing individuals
You'll be part of tranquility, member of the collective

Merely burdening our future generations
Why should we care?
Taxing you to death, regulate your life, unrest
Ensue

Must show discipline, follow the rules in place
They only adhere to you, pay or you're condemned

Constant pressure to relinquish more control
Believe
In the promise that they can handle the power

Establishment knows better than you do
They just might fulfill the prophecy
Using influence to take care of you

Limit personal freedoms, reimburse combined debt

Trusting fools inflating dependence
Incentive gone to attempt to strive for
Relying on yourself
Giving back clout was not part of
This covenant that masses signed on
Was not signed in blood
