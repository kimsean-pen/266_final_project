I've looked for love in stranger places
But never found someone like you
Someone who's smile
Makes me feel I've been holding back
An now there's nothing I can do

Cause this is real and this is good
It warms the inside just like it should
But most of all
Most of all it's built to last
It's built to last
(It's built to last)

All of our friends saw from the start
So why didn't we believe it too?
Now look where we are
You're in my heart now
And there's no escaping it for you

Cause this is real and this is good
It warms the inside just like it should
But most of all
Most of all it's built to last

Walking on the hills at night
With the fire works and candle light
You and I were meant to get love right

Cause this is real and this is good
It warms the inside just like it should
But most of all
Most of all it's built to last
(It's built to last)
Cause you are the sun in my universe
Consider the best when we felt the worst
But most of all
Most of all
Most of all it's built to last
