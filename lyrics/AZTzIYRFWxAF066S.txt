I know there's pain (I know there's pain)
Why do you lock yourself up in these chains? (These chains)
No one can change your life except for you
Don't ever let anyone step all over you

Just open your heart and your mind (Mmm)
Is it really fair to feel, this way inside? (Woah)

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye
Until then, baby, are you going to let 'em hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know? Don't you know, things can change
Things'll go your way
If you Hold On for one more day
Can you Hold On for one more day?
Things'll go your way
Hold On for one more day

You could sustain (You could sustain)
Hm, or are you comfortable with the pain?
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness (No, baby)
You got yourself into your own mess (Ooh)

Lettin' your worries pass you by (Lettin' your worries pass you by)
Baby, don't you think it's worth your time
To change your mind? (No, no)

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye
Until then, baby, are you going to let 'em hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know? Don't you know, things can change
Things'll go your way
If you Hold On for one more day
Can you Hold On for one more day?
Things'll go your way (Oh, things'll go your way)
Hold On for one more day

I know that there is pain, but you
Hold On for one more day, and ya
Break free from the chains
Yeah I know that there is pain, but you
Hold On for one more day, and ya
Break free, break from the chains

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye (and say goodbye)
Until then, baby, are you going to let 'em hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know? Don't you know, things can change (Know)
Things'll go your way
If you Hold On for one more day, yeah
If you Hold On

Don't you know, things could change
Things could go your way
If you Hold On for one more day
Can you Hold On
Can you Hold On

Mmm, can you Hold On, baby

Won't you tell me now
Hold On for one more day, 'cause
It's gonna go your way

Don't you know, things could change
Things could go your way
If you Hold On for one more day, yeah

Can't you change it this time
Make up your mind
Hold On, Hold On
Baby Hold On
