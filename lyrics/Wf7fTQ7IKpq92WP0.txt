Summer med fly ruled the airways
And was mostly superstitious
Now the kings of media
Invent the swine flu visions

Take a load off
(Yeah)
Take a load off
(Yeah)
Take a load off
(Yeah)

Take a load off
(Yeah)
Take a load off
(Yeah)

Take a load off
Yeah, it's alright
As we mosey on into the night
Yeah, just set us free

Can our shattered past just set us free?
Do you want those diamonds?
Get you more and more
Shattered all those lies

I bought you from the record store
Things are gonna crowd in
Now there's room for penetration
Drive around this castle

Howling angry Some were meant And was mostly superstitious
Now the kings of media
Invent the swine flu visions
Take a load off

(Yeah)
Take a load off
(Yeah)
Take a load off

(Yeah)
Take a load off
(Yeah)
Take a load off

(Yeah)
Take a load off
Yeah, it's alright
As we mosey on into the night

Yeah, just set us free
Can our shattered past just set us free?
Do you want those diamonds?
Give you more and more
Shattered all those lies
I bought you from the record store
Do you want those diamonds?
Give you more and more
Shattered all those lies
I bought you from the record
Shattered all those lies
I bought you from the record
Shattered all those lies
I bought you from the record store
