Sooner or later,
I'll be heading home,
Sooner or later,
I'll be on my own, (oh-woah).

June into summer,
I'll wear out my shoes,
June into summer,
Got nothing to lose.

Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,

Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere.
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,

Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere.
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere.

(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh),
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh).

Move in the sun till,
I burn all my ties,
Hayfever scratching,
And watery eyes.

I think I've been waiting,
For this all my life,
Oh, their stopped kisses,
Left frozen in time, oh.

(Woo)!

Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere.

Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere.

(Woo)!

Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere.

Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere.

Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere.

Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere,
Without your love,
I'm gettin' somewhere.
