My bullets made of blind desire
My rage is cast in sainted lead
Searching with atomic eyes
Disowning to the future times

I found myself with blind predation
Caught up in a hopeless game
Standing straight in a battle formation
What once begun will never changed

Partisan
Partisan
Up to my knees in warring blood
Partisan
Partisan
Breaking through the realms of god

Your blasted souls are sacrificed
By depth of hellish gorges
Don't leave the ravished dead unturned
Until the sun engulfs the darkness

We got no choice, we sniped them down
Guerrillas need no exculpation
When all resistance terminated
We'll raise the flag of resurrection

Partisan
Partisan
Up to my knees in warring blood
Partisan
Partisan
Breaking through the realms of god

I'm insane and imperfect
The shadow of the past
Death handed down at birth
Kill anything that I could grasp
I'll never stop my frenzy
Leave nothing undestroyed
Despise your splendorous kingdom
My hatred uncontrolled

Partisan
Partisan
Up to my knees in warring blood
Partisan
Partisan
Breaking through the realms of god

Partisan
Partisan
Partisan
Partisan
Partisan
