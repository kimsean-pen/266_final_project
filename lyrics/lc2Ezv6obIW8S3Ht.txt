I saw you there at night
Your shape appeared in the distance
Your face distorted in the light
And out of breath, I closely listened
Your hungry eyes glow with fire
And light up my humid hollow
Just like me, the treacherous kind
The warning's spelling out your name
The winds are shifting, are you in?
Oh, oh! You make my waters flow
Now look how tall I grow
I'm not human
Oh, oh! With you it's magical
The urge is animal
I'm not human
I felt you take a bite
Your calming voice silently whispered
How do you see your life in time?
And is it worth all of these blisters?
These broken limbs are worn and tired
But our words are not yet written
Our ember still burning inside
The warning's spelling out your name
Are you ready to begin?
Morning will put out this flame
The winds are shifting, are you in?
Oh, oh! You make my waters flow
Now look how tall I grow
I'm not human
Oh, oh! With you it's magical
The urge is animal
I'm not human
Oh, oh! You make my waters flow
Now look how tall I grow
I'm not human
Oh, oh! With you it's magical
The urge is animal
I'm not human
I saw you there at night
Your shape appeared in the distance
Your face distorted in the light
