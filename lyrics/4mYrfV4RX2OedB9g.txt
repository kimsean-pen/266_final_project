I don't mind
If your running around
Giving someone the time
It's all right
Cause I know that you love me
I'm laying in bed
With a whole lot of wonder
Going through my head
This 'don't give a f*ck'
Gets a little bit lonely

I'm too cool to lose my control
You're too cool to go
Later I just don't wanna know
You're out there happenin' it all

Baby Come Home to me
Baby Come Home to me
It's half past quarter to three
Baby Come Home to me
I said I'm that kind of guy
But you're bout to see a grown man cry
Baby Come Home to me
Baby Come Home

Maybe one more pill
Will help me close my eyes
To the pain I feel
I can't sleep
Unless you're laying beside me
I've got no doubt
That you'd be just fine
If you were living without me
But I just can't let you start it tonight

9 10 11 now midnight strikes
I don't know where you been
But I still want to make love tonight
When you come stumbling in

Baby Come Home to me
Baby Come Home to me
It's half past quarter to three
Baby Come Home to me
I said I'm that kind of guy
But you're bout to see a grown man cry
Baby Come Home to me
Baby Come Home

Baby, what do I do? (what do I do?)
Just to keep from turnin' in 2
Baby, what could you say? (what could you say?)
To drop my fears go away
Maybe one red letter day
There'll be no more chips to play
Will you come home
Baby Come Home

Baby Come Home to me
Baby Come Home to me
It's half past quarter to three
Baby Come Home to me

Baby Come Home to me
Baby Come Home to me
It's half past quarter to three
Baby Come Home to me
I said I'm that kind of guy
But you're bout to see a grown man cry
Baby Come Home to me
Baby Come Home
