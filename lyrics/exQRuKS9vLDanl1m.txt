No more running back in time
To many winters east without you
Now we're on the left side
And I can't believe I found you
No more running back in time
To many winters east without you
Now we're on the left side
And I can't believe I found you

Yeah, yeah...

No more running back in time
To many winters east without you
Now we're on the left side
Don't ever wanna leave without you
No more running back in time
To many winters east without you
Now we're on the left side
And I can't believe I found you

Oh, don't take me wrong, don't take me wrong
When I just want to speak, to speak my mind
Oh, don't take me wrong, don't take me wrong
When I...

Yeah, yeah...

Oh, don't take me wrong
Oh, don't take me wrong
Don't take me wrong

No more running back in time
To many winters east without you
Now we're on the left side
Don't ever wanna leave without you
