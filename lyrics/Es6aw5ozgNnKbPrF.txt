Need you for the old me
Need you for my sanity
Need you to remind me where I come from
Can you remind me of my gravity?
Ground me when I'm tumbling, spiraling, plummeting down to Earth
You keep me down to Earth
Call me on my bullshit
Lie to me and say my booty getting bigger even if it ain't
Love me even if it rain
Love me even if it pain you
I know I be difficult
You know I be difficult
You know it get difficult to

Open your heart up
Hoping they'll never find out that you're anyone else
'Cause I love you just how you are
Hope you never find out who I really am
'Cause you'll never love me, you'll never love me, you'll never love me
But I believe you when you say it like dat
Only you need me when you say it like dat
Oh I believe you when you say it like dat
You must really love me

For real, I'm not playing no games
Pulling back and forth
I need your support now (now, now, now, now, now)
In case you call my phone I don't care
Got no panties on
I need your support now (now, now, now, now, now)
I know you'd rather be laying up with a big booty
Body hella positive 'cause she got a big booty (wow)
I know I'd rather be paid up
You know I'm sensitive about having no booty, having no body, only you buddy
Can you hold me when nobody's around us

Open your heart up
Hoping they'll never find out that you're anyone else
'Cause I love you just how you are
Hope you never find out who I really am
'Cause you'll never love me, you'll never love me, you'll never love me
But I believe you when you say it like dat
Only you need me when you say it like dat
Oh I believe you when you say it like dat
You must really love me

You don't got shit to say to me
I ain't got shit to say to you
Granny, and that's the truth
And step on
Also you black heffa, you stand your ground
'Cause I feel the same wayIf you don't like me
You don't have to fool with me
You don't have to talk about me or treat me mean
I don't have to treat you mean
I just stay out of your way
That's the way you work that one
