on in down around
caught up in small flames
looking for light
it's always behind you
oh
gone are the ways we were
oh
love until end
suddenly surrender
give it to you
revolving
sink in
to skin
always reminded
oh
charging
madly
carrying your voice
gone are the ways we were
oh
love until end
suddenly surrender
give it to you
revolving
we fall
we fall
we fall
we fall
