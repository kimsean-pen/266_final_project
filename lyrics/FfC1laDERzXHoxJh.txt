Aftermath of the catch
Reeling in the secrets of the swamp
A motorcade harrowed and dapper underneath the surface founded
Its talons curl they come to get you boy
Howling like...
A toothless grinned swamp thing is lurking, come get you
Is lusting for your skin
Its hunger is climbing
A willow wisp, a rum soaked ritual
Ravenous it's cold stare is habitual
Send a message with fire smouldering across the lily pad,
saffron tears the sweetest you've ever had
A toothless grinned swamp thing is lurking, come get you
Come close dear I could hold you safe in the water where the pressure crush you like pestle and mortar
Kiss your fever sleep forever
To sleep forever
Forever
Forever...
