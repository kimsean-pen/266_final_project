Butterfly mornings
Butterfly mornings
Catch me there
Gonna get me there
If I have to climb all the mountains on the moon
I'll be in butterfly mornings
Butterfly mornings
And wild flower afternoons

I found you in the corner
Down there sitting on the seat
Gonna trace your footsteps
Underneath the waves
On the petals of a wild flower
With the sun
I want walks in butterfly mornings
And wild flower afternoons

Butterfly mornings
Wild flower afternoons
