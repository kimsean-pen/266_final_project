Yeah they scream when they with me
Yeah they dream when they with me
Yeah they beam when they with me
Glo'd up when they with me

I'm okay man
Hugh Hefner my dough man
Day ones with me still don't trust no-body
Bitches come and go I'm on the hunt for that punani
Why you acting single know you're married
Hoe you bluffin'
See me making movies say she fucking with the style man
Hitting on the pussy, call me up I fly like Tarzan
Licking [?] we make em' ball man
Hitting on the pussy balling full court on a Sunday

We twip the fwip and up the four, man
You know we caught that bitch on Sunday
Hit up that cookhouse in the round, man
We take your rolley rolley rolleys
I push the petal hold like 2k
And all I'm asking is a new day
You wasn't makin money fuck boy
You talking crazy in the dark boy

Bite her you know I'm a beast
Tasting so good imma feast
Girl, she in love with the squad
LNIP that's the team
My gang you know that's my bros
I got like 25 shows
She hit me up in the morning
Baby girl just want her clothes
All of them bitches go freaky
Fuck her so good that she need me
Hop on a plane, you know that I'm gone
I doubt this bitch ever gon' see me
I don't want love I want money
I buy that Polo and Tommy
We from the hood you know that we on
I dare you fuck boys come and try me (Ah yeah)

Yeah they scream when they with me
Yeah they dream when they with me
Yeah they beam when they with me
Glo'd up when they with me
Yeah they wanna fuck with me
Yeah they wanna text to me
Yeah they wanna come with me
So I guess I'm Diddy
