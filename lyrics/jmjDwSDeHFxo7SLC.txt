Every girl's a story, call it morning glory
She works at the Pink Pony, oh
Dancing on the table, and everybody's able
Holding up his dollars, pointing as he hollers

It's you, well you knock me out, baby
I want a secret family with you
Well you knock me out, baby

It's too big to bag on,
Gotta get my swag on
Looking for an adult
Standing in the mirror,
Tryin' to get you nearer
Funky misdemeanor
This is what he said

He said,
I've been a lonely man, du du du du du du du
Such a lonely man, du du du du du du du
I've been a lonely man, du du du du du du du
Such a lonely man, du du du du du du du

It's you, well you knock me out baby
I want a secret family with you
Well you knock me out, baby

First we went to the buffet
With the cell phone put away
Girl you dope like D.E.A.
And it's bigger than both of us

It's you, well you knock me out, baby
I want a secret family with you
And it's alright

I've been a lonely man
Such a lonely man
I've been a lonely man
Such a lonely man

Now I've got you, well you knock me out, baby
I want a secret family with you
Well you knock me out, baby

First we went to the buffet
With the cell phone put away
Girl you dope like D.E.A.
And it's bigger than both of us

It's you, well you knock me out, baby
I want a secret family with you
Start a secret family with you
And it's alright
Yeah it's alright
