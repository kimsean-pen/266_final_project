I am a back door man
I am a back door man
Well, the men don't know
But the little girls understand

When everybody's sound asleep
I'm somewhere making my midnight creep
Yes, in the morning, the rooster crow
Something tell me, I got to go

I am a back door man
I am a back door man
Well, the men don't know
But little girls understand

They take me to the doctor, shot full of holes
Nurse cried, please save the soul
Killed him for murder, first degree
Judge's wife cried, let the man go free

I am a back door man
I am a back door man
Well, the men don't know
But little girls understand

Stand out there, cop's wife cried
Don't take him down, rather be dead, six feets in the ground
When you come home you can eat pork and beans
I eats mo' chicken any man seen

I am a back door man
I am a back door man
