Two months ago now
Since she came around your house
Her answering machine's full
He thinks listening could give her doubts
But when this girl's made up her mind
She's made up her mind, made up her mind
Looking out to the horizon
No turnin' back
No wasting time

Smooth cat rider
Stop bragging cause she broke your facade
Don't we all want to be stars and all
Stop playin' with the one that you love
Smooth cat rider stop bragging cause it's gone to your head
So smooth wish you were smart instead
Stop playing with the one that you love

A fountain in the hall big old portraits of himself on the wall
A diamond sculpture face
This peacock is flying all over the place
The tiger's extra cars
No she's not impressed
Your laughs and stupid jokes
The only thing she missed
Now you can't stop looking back
Leaving messages

Smooth cat rider
Stop bragging cause she broke your facade
Don't we all want to be stars and all
Stop playin' with the one that you love
Smooth cat rider stop playing cause it's gone to your head
So smooth wish you were smart instead
Stop playing with the one that you love

Empty bottles, where to go next
Knowing what you truly missed
It's too late, can't rewind it
Can't get out your king-size bed
Now you're left with names to forget
Tryin' to heal from the pain
If only you could rewind it
Would not have acted the same
Smooth cat rider
She broke your facade
Smooth cat rider
Mmhmm
