Maybe it'll rain today
And I won't have to leave my room
Givin' me the time
I need to get rid of your things
Enough procrastinating

Why you gone?

Maybe it'll rain today
And I won't have to leave my room

The answers may sting

And the smoke
In my eyes makes it hard not to cry
Why you gone?
The reason is suppose to make sense
But it don't

Give me something to spark the flame
Take away the pain
Take it away
I can feel the heat
From my face

Give me something to spark the flame
Take away the pain
Take it away
I can feel the heat
From my face

Give me something to spark the flame
Take away the pain
Take it away
I can feel the heat
From my
