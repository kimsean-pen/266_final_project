Yeah, I'm waitin' for you, it's been so long
Yeah, I'm waitin' for you, it's been so long
Yeah, I'm sad when I'm on my own
They said, it takes a long, long time
If it's not too much, could you hear me now?

You promised me you'd always be
When I wake up, please come around again
Come around again

You promised me you'd always be
When I wake up, please come around again
Come around again, yeah

Yeah, I'm waitin' for you, it's been so long
Yeah, I'm sad when I'm all alone
They said it takes a long long time
If it's not too much, could you hear me now?

You promised me you'd always be
When I wake up, please come around again
Come around again

You promised me you'd always be
When I wake up, please come around again

Yeah, there's something I was thinking about
Get it out of my head
Yeah, something was kicking around
Somethin' you said

I don't know when I'm right
I only know when I'm wrong
So when you gonna leave some light to show it all?
And keep the lights from going off
'Coz I don't see, yeah

'Coz, I'm waitin' for you, it's been so long
Yeah, I'm lost but I'm at home
They said, it takes a long, long time
If it's not too much, could you hear me now?

Come around again
Come around again
Please come around again
