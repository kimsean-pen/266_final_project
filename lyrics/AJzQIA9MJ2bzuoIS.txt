Cantus lupus
Satura luna
Corpus nudus domina

Agnus totus
Animus mortus
Ave deus sinistra

Cultus lupus
Opus damnatus
Metus mortis nocturna

Terra sanguis
Padre occultus
Sanctus pupus anima

Dark is the day
God of the grey
Born to obey
All they will say
Mine is the way
Fall down and pray

Hey, hey, wolves don't pray!

Symbols of pain
Out in the rain
sent to remain
The harvest of the grain
Mine is the blame
The curse of the sane

Hey, hey, wolves don't pray!

Ahh - Lupus dei
