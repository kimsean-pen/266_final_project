How you make me feel this way
When there's nothing left to say
Just our eyes communicate
I lose control

I love it when you do that thing to me
I love it when you do that thing
I love it when you do that thing to me

I love it when you do

Oh my body gravitates

I love it when you do that thing
I love it when you do that thing to me
I love it when you do that thing
I love it when you do that thing to me

I love it when you do
