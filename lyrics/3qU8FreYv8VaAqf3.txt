Darling, I know that you still take care of me
It means the world to me
And my life sways back and forth like the light from above
It's true, now we we both can see opportunity
Or our chance

But, mother, you knew your love kept on hurting me
But you're my family, why would you?
But father and you, you tried to take care of me
But she came through for me, either side

She became my sun, my moon
She's my evergreen
She means the world to me

She means the world
