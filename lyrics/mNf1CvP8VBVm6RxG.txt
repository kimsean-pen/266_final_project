Out in the streets, they call it murder

Welcome to Jamrock, camp where the thugs them camp at
Two pounds a weed inna van back
It inna your hand bag, your knapsack, it inna your back pack
The smell a give your girlfriend contact
Soundboy nuh know this, them only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, and pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And don't know the real hardcore
Cause Sandals a now back too, the thugs then we do what them got to
And won't think twice to shot you
Don't make them spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A pure tuff things come at you

When Trenchtown man stop laugh and block-off traffic
Then them wheel and pop off and them start clap it
With the pin file dung and it a beat rapid
Police come inna jeep and them cant stop it
Some say them a playboy a playboy rabbit
get dropped like a bad habit
So don't bother pose off if you don't have it
Rastafari stands alone!

Welcome to Jamrock, Welcome to Jamrock
Out in the streets, they call it merther!

Welcome to Jamdown, poor people are dead at random
Political violence, can't done! Pure ghost and phantom, the youth
them get blind by stardom
Now the King Of Kings a call
old man to Pickney, so wave one hand if you with me
To see the sufferation sicken me
Them suit no fit me, to win election them trick we
And them don't do nuttin at all

Come on let's face it, a ghetto education's basic
And most a the youths them waste it
And when they waste it, that's when they take the guns, replace it
Then them don't stand a chance at all
And that's why a nuff little youth have up some fat matic
With the extra magazine inna them back pocket
And a bleach a night time inna some black jacket
All who not lock glocks, at them a lock rocket
Them will full you up a current like a short circuit
Them a run a roadblock which part the cops block it
And from now till a mornin not stop clock it
If they run outta rounds a broke- back ratchet

Out in the streets, they call it merther!
