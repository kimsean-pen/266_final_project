Sometimes my visions are distant and
vague, down at the base of the mountain
Once in a while I am weak and afraid, tired and sick of it all

I don't believe that my story is set, nothing is destined or blatant
Bound to this body, a world full of hate, no one will heed if I fall

No one can see it but you know that
it's there, guiding the steps of your soul
Holding the truth in the cross that
you bear, die with a heart that is bold

Fly on the wings of despair
No one is holding you back
The call on the wild is internal
(Oh, then you)
Conquer the silence you fear
Tomorrow will not fade to black
A new day is dawning, remember;
No one can save you today!

Questions are more than the answers I
know, that doesn't mean you are lonely
Searching for more consecutive goals, making it worth to go on

No one can see it but you know that
it's there, guiding the steps of your soul
Holding the truth in the cross that
you bear, die with a heart that is bold

Fly on the wings of despair
No one is holding you back
The call of the wild is internal
(Oh, then you)
Conquer the silence you fear
Tomorrow will not fade to black
A new day is dawning, remember;
No one can save you today!

You, and you alone, forging the path
Leave your sorrows with the past

Never believe that the story is set, nothing is destined or blatant
Bound to this body, a world full of hate, no one will heed if you fall

No one can see it but you know that
it's there guiding the steps of your soul
Holding the truth in the cross that
you bear, die with a heart that is bold

Fly on the wings of despair
No one is holding you back
The call on the wild is internal
(Oh, then you)
Conquer the silence you fear
Tomorrow will not fade to black
A new day is dawning, remember;
No one can save you today!

Fly on the wings of despair
No one is holding you back
The call on the wild is internal
Conquer the silence you fear
tomorrow will not fade to black
A new day is dawning, remember;
No one can save you to- no one can save you today
