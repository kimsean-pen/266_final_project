I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

Thinkin' of you and the love of our lives
In the sweet summertime
So sad but true
(So true, so true)
We must leave it behind in our hearts, in our minds

From April through September
Bittersweet was the love that we share
Don't forget, I remember

I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

Memories can fade
But my heart has a place for the smile on your face
And maybe someday
We can be more than friends, love will find us again

Red leaves and blue tomorrows
Time will give back the love that we shared
On the time that we borrowed

I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

From April through September
Bittersweet was the love that we share
Don't forget, I remember, baby, baby

I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

We'll leave behind the summertime
Our hearts, our minds, they will remind
We won't forget the day we met
The day we cried, autumn goodbye

I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
