Everything I do is never gonna work
I don't know my self worth
Everything I ever did
Everything I've never done
I know in the end I'm alone
I know in the end I'm alone
And if I died then
Everyone I love is let down
At least my pains are gone
I look at my life a thousand times
To live, to love, to learn, to lie
Until we are dust
