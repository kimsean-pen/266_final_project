Tricky:
(Hawkman in the background)
I can picture it now
You in your car
Left the bar
Playing Big Part
Keep up complainin'
It's probably rainin'
Keeping complaining
It's probably raining
You're gonna visit your car
It's one of my peeps
With a blow to your head
Is that what you need
You're probably bleeding
Is that what you needed
You're probably bleeding
Just like a movie
Just like a movie
Just like a movie
Life doesn't move me
Life doesn't move me
I keep with you now
Here in your car
Left the bar
Playing the Big Part
Keeping complaining
It's probably raining
It's one of my peeps
With a blow to your head
Is that what you needed
What you needed
What you needed
You caught me breathing
It's just like a movie
Life's just like a movie
It's like a movie
Just like a movie
It doesn't move me
Move me
Move me
It doesn't move me
Life doesn't move
It doesn't move me
Move me
It's like a blow to the head
It's like a blow to my head
It doesn't move me
Move me
Move me
Move me
It doesn't move me
It's like a movie
Just like a movie
Blow to the head
Life's like a blow to the head
What you needed what you needed what you needed

Life's like a blow to the head
It's that what you needed
Is that what you needed
What you needed
A blow to the head
Move Me
Move me
It doesn't move
It doesn't move
It's like a movie
Movie Movie
Just like a movie
It doesn't move me
It's like a movie
