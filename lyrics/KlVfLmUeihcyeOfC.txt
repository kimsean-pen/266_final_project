Well I'm gettin' tired workin' hard every day
Workin' every day and not a-gettin' much pay
I got a big geiger counter, it's a pretty good rig
When the needle starts clickin' it's where I'm gonna dig
Money-money honey, and the kind you fold
Money-money honey, rock 'n' roll
Rake it in, bale it up like hay
Have a rockin' good time and throw it all away

Well, I can see me now in my long Cadillac
Hinges in the middle, spare wheel on the back
Man, don't you know I'd be hard to stop
When I find that big uranium rock
Money-money honey, and the kind you fold
Money-money honey, rock 'n' roll
Rake it in, bale it up like hay
Have a rockin' good time and throw it all away

Yes, that's me in my long Cadillac
Headin' down the road and I ain't comin' back
Ain't no red light gonna make me stop
When I find that big uranium rock
Money-money honey, and the kind you fold
Money-money honey, rock 'n' roll
Rake it in, bale it up like hay
Have a rockin' good time and throw it all away
