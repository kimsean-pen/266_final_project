I've never been so in and out of touch
I've never given so little promised so much
I've never used a woman like you, before

You've never been so sure and so afraid
You've never been so broken and so brave
I'll never lose a woman like you, again

Wondering when
Carry me home
Keep my love
When you come
When you go

I don't want to do this anymore
We've been down this lonely road once before
We've seen it all
We know the flaws
I don't want to sing another song
About the ways I got everything wrong
To list it all, just takes too long

Wondering when
Carry me home
Keep my love
When you come
When you go

Wondering when
Carry me home
Keep my love
When you come
When you go

Keep my love
When you come
When you go
