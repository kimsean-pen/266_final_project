The Queen is marching back to Paris tonight
The priests are praying and preparing the rites
Another animal gets drowned in the Seine
Enemies, enemies will never be friends

The city's artifacts are thrown into bags
The safe's been blown apart, the river's been dragged
Another diver's got a case of the bends
Enemies, enemies will never be friends

The Queen is marching back to London tonight
The new regime is hunkered down for a fight
Another animal gets drowned in the Thames
Enemies, enemies will never be friends

The city's quiet and awaiting the Blitz
A candle's lit where old Victoria sits
Babylon's burning and a dynasty ends
Enemies, enemies will never be friends

Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away

It's a pain but not a shock
Bombs away
Let that old Gomorrah rock
Bombs away
Let the fires light the road
Bombs away
The metropolis explodes

Bombs away
It's a pain but not a shock
Bombs away
Let that old Gomorrah rock
Bombs away
Let the fires light the road
Bombs away
The metropolis explodes
Bombs away
It's a pain but not a shock
Bombs away
Let that old Gomorrah rock
Bombs away
Let the fires light the road
Bombs away
The metropolis explodes

The Queen is marching back to Paris tonight
The priests are praying and preparing the rites
I saw reflections of this world in the Seine
I saw the Amazon, the Rhine and the Thames

The times I tried to get away from it all
Just left me standing with my back to the wall
Another strategy regarding my heart
All these explosions are a shot in the dark

Bombs away
It's a pain but not a shock
Bombs away
Let that old Gomorrah rock
Bombs away
Let the fires light the road
Bombs away
The metropolis explodes

Bombs away
It's a pain but not a shock
Bombs away
Let that old Gomorrah rock
Bombs away
Let the fires light the road
Bombs away
The metropolis explodes
