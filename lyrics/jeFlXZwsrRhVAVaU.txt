Take me away
Yeah
That's enough of all your taunting
Seems I can't remove you from my mind
Don't you know sometimes I wish they'd
Kill me for wanting you
I will sit alone in silence
Can't allow the meaning I can find

Will you be defeated when they
Kill me for wanting you
I can't believe that my sanity lies
In abandoning you

I can't recall a more helpless time
Perpetrated by you
Sickened from wanting you
Frightened of finding the truth
Don't say any more
Now my mind isn't changing
This reckoning's long overdue
Alabaster walls surround me

In the prison of my own design
Will I win my freedom if they
Kill me for wanting you
Maybe arms of hell will hound me

Just as long as I remain confined

I will be completed when they
Kill me for wanting you
I can't believe that my sanity lies
In abandoning you
I can't recall a more helpless time
Perpetrated by you
Sickened from wanting you
Frightened of finding the truth

Don't say any more
Now my mind isn't changing
This reckoning's long overdue
So I have determined I am long done

Will I bury another problem
In the graveyard you allowed me to find
So I
Have determined I am no one
When I finally cling to something
That has never been tied to
Any single memory of you
Sickened from wanting you
Frightened of finding the truth
Don't say any more
Now my mind isn't changing
This reckoning's long overdue
So I
Have determined that I am long done
Will I bury another problem
In the graveyard you allowed me to find
