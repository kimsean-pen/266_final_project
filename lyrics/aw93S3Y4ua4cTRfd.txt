Where have all the heroes gone that used to bleed for us?
Still holding on to fading lullabies,
and fear the end when every note is lost

How can we know if a glance beyond
the shadow wall could free our souls?

In the wake behind the virtuous we carry
on while listening to the poetry of lies
And darkened by the prosperous we
carry on as ignorance of human life subsides

They left us blind and broke our pride, they told us to be brave
But like an insect drawn to light,
we circle around the radiance of truth

How can we know if a glance beyond
the shadow wall could free our souls?

In the wake behind the virtuous we carry
on while listening to the poetry of lies
And darkened by the prosperous we
carry on as ignorance of human life subsides

I am you, you are me
Feel the grace, I set you free!
I am the empire!
Empire!
I am the empire!
Empire!
I am the empire!
Empire!
I am- I am the empire!

I am learning to crawl
Denying the fall
In time, I'll stand again

I am bare to the skin, I'm refusing to give in
You can't break my heart again

But I try, I keep trying
And I'm dying to forgive
All the matters is what's going to be

I try, I keep trying
I'm dying to forgive

I am you, you are me!

In the wake behind the virtuous we carry
on while listening to the poetry of lies
And darkened by the prosperous we
carry on as ignorance of human life subsides
