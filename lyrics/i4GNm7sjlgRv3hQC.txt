I was on LSD when I saved that family
And I was on LSD at all the talk shows after
'Cause Jackie slapped me at a family party last year
He mumbled something
I mumbled something back
Neither of us said anything after that
Neither of us said anything after that

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm just a tie dye dragon
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm just a tie dye dragon

Back at school I was anxious
Played it cool
Let other people do the stressing for me
I'm a fool to feel anxious
When something dies that's it
It's dead, I gotta let it be

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm just a tie dye dragon
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm just a tie dye dragon

Guided by confused light
I am guided by confused light
I see the future in mysterious ways
I'm just a tie dye dragon

I guess I'm older now
I guess I'm older now
I am caught in between who I am
And who I'm supposed to be
Everything's confusing...
Everything's confusing...
Everything's confusing...
Everything's confusing...

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm just a tie dye dragon
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm just a tie dye dragon

Guided by confused light
I am guided by confused light
I see the future in mysterious ways
I'm just a tie dye dragon
