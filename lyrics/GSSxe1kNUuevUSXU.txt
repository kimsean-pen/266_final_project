Too low to love you, somebody to hold, somebody to care for.
And I would go back to the old lands I used to care for.
I'm so confused lying here alone locked up in my room.
Oh the night is cruel; You.
And there were no goodbyes; the only thing I know is that these walls have eyes.

And I would go back to the old lands I used to care for.
Oh your fist so red, leather jacket collar up I'm dead.
And you hit me first, bit through my lips until they bled and hurt.
And I feel so strange when the only one I know in this place's called Change.
Running through my veins; You
