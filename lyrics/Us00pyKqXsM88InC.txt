So if we start with a kiss on the lips tonight
Baby, will you do it right?
I drew a picture of you with a smile on it
But then I kinda drooled on it
And when we do it again, it will be for real (for real)
'Cause we are me and you
And me, and you
And me, and you
And me, and you
And me

Deep inside
Like a wet, wet slide
And kiss me deep inside
Like a wet, wet slide
And kiss me

(What you got?)

Tongue into tongue
Warm like a gun
Forever young
Fit like we run
Tongue into tongue
Warm like a gun
Forever young
Fit like we run

I like it when we kiss with a tongue
Muscle of fun, inside my mouth
I like it when we kiss with a tongue
Muscle of fun, inside my mouth
I like it when we kiss with a tongue
Muscle of fun, inside my mouth
I like it when we kiss with a tongue
Muscle of fun, inside my mouth

I like it when we kiss with a tongue
(tongue into tongue, warm like a gun)
Muscle of fun, inside my mouth (forever young, fit like we run)
I like it when we kiss with a tongue
(tongue into tongue, warm like a gun)
Muscle of fun, inside my mouth (forever young, fit like we run)
I like it when we kiss with a tongue
(tongue into tongue, warm like a gun)
Muscle of fun, inside my mouth (forever young, fit like we run)
I like it when we kiss with a tongue
(tongue into tongue, warm like a gun)
Muscle of fun, inside my mouth (forever young, fit like we run)

I think they're ready (for it)
I think they're ready (for it)

I like it when we kiss with a tongue
Muscle of fun, inside my mouth
I like it when we kiss with a tongue
Muscle of fun, inside my mouth

I like it when we kiss with a tongue
(tongue into tongue, warm like a gun)
Muscle of fun, inside my mouth (forever young, fit like we run)
I like it when we kiss with a tongue
(tongue into tongue, warm like a gun)
Muscle of fun, inside my mouth (forever young, fit like we run)
