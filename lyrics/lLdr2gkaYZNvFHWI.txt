I'll make it quick for you to know
Splashing my feelings is not what I'm the best at
I've never told you many things that I should
The words are on my lips, it's time to tell you the truth

I'll make it quick for you to know
Splashing my feelings is not what I'm the best at
I've never told you many things that I should
The words are on my lips, it's time to tell you the truth

I belong to the roads now
Coming home to my old town
This pretty smile on this pretty face
I think I am the happiest man on earth

I belong to the roads now
Coming home to my old town
This pretty smile on this pretty face
I think I am the happiest man on earth
I think I am the happiest man on earth

Will you let me empty
The pain in your eyes?
The chains in your heart
I'm gonna break it with my arms

Whenever you feel sad
In times of dark days
Going through a bad patch
Please come and take my hand

I care too much about you
To let you get drowned
I'll always stay around
Whenever you hit the ground

I belong to the roads now
Coming home to my old town
This pretty smile on this pretty face
I think I am the happiest man on earth

I belong to the roads now
Coming home to my old town
This pretty smile on this pretty face
I think I am the happiest man on earth
I think I am the happiest man on earth

Will you let me empty
The pain in your eyes?
The chains in your heart
I'm gonna break it with my arms

I care too much about you
To let you get drowned
I'll always stay around
Whenever you hit the ground

I belong to the roads now
Coming home to my old town
This pretty smile on this pretty face
I think I am the happiest man on earth

I belong to the roads now
Coming home to my old town
This pretty smile on this pretty face
I think I am the happiest man on earth
I think I am the happiest man on earth
I think I am the happiest man on earth
