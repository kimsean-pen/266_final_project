And if I ever (ever fall)
In love again (again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
Ladies
If I ever fall

I'm not like them regular chicks
When I go for a hit, I don't miss
Go for a hit, I don't miss
I'm not like them regular bitches
Not like them regular chicks
Not like them regular chicks
When my man dive in
I go in and smash on them bitches

Got my fam out the hood
Cash out buyin' good now
Got it poppin' like I should've
Live my life, kinda loca
In the neck of the woods
In the neck of the woods
It ain't trickin' 'if you got it
When I pull up on 'em they be wylin'

I'm in the city and I'm pretty wit' it
Diamonds on me, got me feelin' big
Is you with me if I fall down
Lemme know, lemme know, know
'Cause I'm in the goal, but fired up?
Fuck love, I'ma handle my stuff
Told you, I'm not like them regular chicks
I ain't gon' deal with no regular shit
He say he love me but play with the ting
I be like "damn, who you kiddin'?"

I'm not like 'em regular chicks
Nobody gon' diss me or call me a bitch
I be like them "damn, who you kiddin'?"
Run up, run up, get done up
If they kick me down I'm gon' come up
I'm always gon' have one up
Livin' my life, I won't give up
I got my money, I can make do
Made one milli, I could make two
Ain't no favors, I've been workin', working back to back
God knows I stay true

I'm not like them regular chicks
When I go for a hit, I don't miss
Go for a hit, I don't miss
I'm not like them regular bitches
Not like them regular chicks
Not like them regular chicks

When my man dive in
I go in and smash on them bitches
Got my fam out the hood
Cash out buyin' good now
Got it poppin' like I should've
Live my life, kinda loca
In the neck of the woods
In the neck of the woods
It ain't trickin' 'if you got it
When I pull up on 'em they be wylin'

Diamonds on my wrist, diamonds on my neck
Every time I step back I've got these bitches pressed
Ooh they throwin' shots, but it ain't direct
You know they could never come at me direct

Swear I ain't just like your regular
Poppin', we gettin' that chedda' bro
Flickin' my wrist like a balla'
Bitches gon' hate 'cause they regular
You think you're best, then you high?
Someone need slap you a joker
Someone need slap you a joker
Hailassie give money to ya, my guy?
Whoa-oah-oah-oah
You know what it is

Baby you know that it's like that
If I leave you, you ain't gon' like that
You know I'm wit' the G's
You know I'm turnin' up
You know I'm poppin' tags
You know I'm wit' the stuff
If I spend it I make it back
Money I run, and I run wit' Jah
How you gon' treat me like bitches on crack
How you gon' treat me like bitches
Bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches

Diamonds on my wrist, diamonds on my neck
Every time I step back I've got these bitches pressed
Ooh they throwin' shots, but it ain't direct
You know they could never come at me direct

Oooh, lovin' what you do
