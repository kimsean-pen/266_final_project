One more long haul
Across the day
The glow of radar lights
In my way

I just get by
Without a word
I'll let you work it out
On the way

Who knows when they'll open their eyes
It's a back to back sunrise

I won't be there
When your head rolls in
I am all at once none of it and everything
I can't look the other way
When you just keep getting higher

Missiles falling
Heavy and blind
Silent alarms
Fill up my mind

Wake me up with
My blinders on
I can't fight this
Resistance gone

It takes an army to light up your mind
Hallucinations to see your spine
I can't look the other way
When you just keep getting brighter

Missiles falling
Heavy and blind
Silent alarms
Fill up my mind

Wake me up with
My blinders on
I can't fight my
Resistance gone
Gone
Gone

Missiles raining
Heavy and blind
Miss me every
Single time
Wake me up with
Your crazy song
I can't fight my
Resistance gone
Gone
Gone
