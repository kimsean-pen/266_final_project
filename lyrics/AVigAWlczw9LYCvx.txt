Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god theyre gonna eat me up for breakfast
You think you look good in whatever they sugarcoat you in
If my body is a temple you can worship at my feet but it might kick you in the teeth some
So even when youre spitting blood you would save a thought for me

Cos I got so down I held the world to ransom
Lonely, bored and bad thank god I'm handsome (so handsome)

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I should be picking up the pieces
But it doesnt really matter as once you thought it would when you got nothing to lose
Everybody else I know would talk to me of misery as if it was contagious
So come to me and promise me youll catch me if you can

Cos I got so down I held the world to ransom
Lonely, bored and bad thank god I'm handsome
I'm as awful as they come oh what a pity
So I thank the lord above that I am pretty (so pretty)

P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p so pretty
I'm p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p so pretty

Well I got so down I held the world to ransom
Lonely, bored and bad thank god I'm handsome
Arresting, prepossessing and disarming
Oh what a stroke of luck that I am charming
With a hand layed out upon me by committee
I just thank the lord above that I am pretty (so pretty)
