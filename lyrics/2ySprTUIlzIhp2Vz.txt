I? ve played that song from long ago
When every morning longed to fall
It broke my sighs and my regrets
It stumbled on the steps

You? ve build for climbing towards me
Now it feels like sinners in the sun

When I said, I said, "I? d die for you"
Or was it in my head?
I took you down on ouzo
And now I think I? d rather see you dead

I said, "I? d die for you"
Or was it in my head?
You took me down on ouzo
And then you said you'd rather see me dead, dead

If my depression stood the wind
I spat the devil up his chin
It couldn? t do me any harm
It roughed my steel and shut my mouth

My late impression
Oh, that rain that? s itching on my skin

When I said, I said, "I? d die for you"
Or was it in my head?
I took you down on ouzo
And now I think I? d rather see you dead

I said, "I? d die for you"
Or was it in my head?
You took me down on ouzo
And then you said you'd rather see me dead, dead

Well, I mean
Hold me, scratch my shoulder
Fold me, sue me, watch me going mad

I said, I said, "I? d die for you"
Or was it in my head?
I took you down on ouzo
And now I think I? d rather see you dead

I said, "I? d die for you"
Or was it in my head?
You took me down on ouzo
And then you said you'd rather see me dead, dead
