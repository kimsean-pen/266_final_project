I'm so cold and numb today
I've nowhere to close my way
I will wait for you
I will see you through

Call off dinner
We can pretend
I don't want nobody
Alone anymore
Somewhere you'll find
Waking my mind
Frozen inside, way back home

There's a silence in this place
I can hear the sound ripping
Don't teach your mind
Need to be okay
I'll be better here with you
Guilty all over
Body or soul
Back off so different here with you

Away I come,
Away I go with you, with you
