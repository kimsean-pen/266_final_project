My heart is frozen
My soul's been broken
The whole world's on my mother fuckin' shoulders
and I can't seem to control it
I can't contain it
And I just don't give a shit
You need to feel the way that I feel
but you'll never fuckin' know it

Burn motherfucker
Burn motherfucker
Burn!
You try but you can't reach me
Burn motherfucker
Burn motherfucker
Burn!
There is nothing you can teach me
In hell

Motherfucker burn
Motherfucker burn
I swear you're out to get me
Burn motherfucker
Burn motherfucker
Burn!
I'd live but you won't let me
BURN!!!

Your life's been wasted
You'll die forsaken
You act like the world's on your shoulders
but it's not there so you fake it
Do you embrace it
How do you take it
I'll never feel the way that you feel
I'd rather fucking break it

Burn motherfucker
Burn motherfucker

Burn!

You try but you can't reach me

Burn motherfucker
Burn motherfucker
Burn!

There is nothing you can't teach me

In hell
Motherfucker burn
Motherfucker burn
I swear you're out to get me
Burn motherfucker
Burn motherfucker
Burn!
I'd live but you won't let me
Burn motherfucker
Burn motherfucker, burn
Burn motherfucker
Burn motherfucker, burn
Burn motherfucker
Burn motherfucker, burn
BURN MOTHERFUCKER!!!
BURN!!!
BURN!!!
BURN!!!
Burn motherfucker
Burn motherfucker
Burn!
Burn motherfucker
Burn motherfucker
Burn!
Burn motherfucker
Burn motherfucker
Burn!
BURN MOTHERFUCKER!!!!
Burn motherfucker
Burn motherfucker
Burn!
You try but you can't reach me
Burn motherfucker
Burn motherfucker
Burn!
There is nothing you can teach me
In hell
Motherfucker burn
Motherfucker burn
I swear you're out to get me
Burn motherfucker
Burn motherfucker
Burn!
I'd live but you won't let me
BURN!!
BURN!!!!!
