I make a frown, I always wear it upside down
'Cause life is carnage
I once was lost, but now I'm floundered
And running late for my funerary date
Burn me later, could you smile while you do it

I don't care anymore
Swear I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
Swear I don't care anymore

I was born with a lucky 88 on my door
Put down your last claim to fame for me, boy

(Keep me starving and get something better started)
(Keep me starving and get something better started)

Trying to work in this town
Without a silver spoon or foot in your mouth
You see that lucky 88 on my door

(Keep me starving and get something better started)
(Keep me starving and get something better started)

One more time with reeling
You siphoned out the feeling
Can't you act responsibly, you're the sick pup who created me
Burn out and fade
I'll convalesce you right into the grave

I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
Swear I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore

I was born with a lucky 88 on my door
Put down your last claim to fame for me, boy

(Keep me starving and get something better started)
(Keep me starving and get something better started)

I was born in the cold-clouded heart of the storm
You see that lucky 88 on the door
(Keep me starving, or get something better started)
(Keep me starving, or get something started started)

I was born with a lucky 88 on my door
A lucky 88 on my door
With a lucky 88 on my door
A lucky 88
