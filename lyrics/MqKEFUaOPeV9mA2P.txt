Oh my love, I remember
Waking up to the sound of your voice
Digitized and distraught
I was halfway to Calais from Dover
When the word had finally come over
Thought we said never again?

Ooh my love, can't believe
The headline crawls across the screen
I couldn't fall asleep

And it's raining on both ends of the phone
You're in the lobby and I'm on my way home
But there's no shelter without you there

Some things are so simple
They're impossible to explain
The Caf√© Amarillo
Stay dry when you're caught in the rain
We're caught in the rain

I don't wanna die before I learn to live
Looking for my exits
Still so bad at making plans I plan to keep
How long has it been?

And it's raining on both ends of the phone
You're in the lobby and I'm on my way home
But there's no shelter without you there

Some things are so simple
They're impossible to explain
You can't unpull a trigger
Or stay dry when you're caught in the rain
We're caught in the rain

I long for when the sun was in our eyes
One day, forever, the sun in our eyes
