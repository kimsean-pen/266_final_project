Have you heard about the boom on Mizar five
People got to shout to stay alive
They don? t even have policeman one
Doesn? t matter where you've been or what you? ve done

Do you have a dark spot on your past
Leave it to my man, he? ll fix it fast
This guy Pepe has a scar from ear to ear
He will make your mug shots disappear

You zombie
Be born again my friend
Won? t you sign in stranger

Do you like to take a yo-yo for a ride
Zombie, I can see you? re qualified
Walk around collecting Turkish union dues
They will call you sir and shine your shoes

Or maybe you would like to see the show
You? ll enjoy the cafe d? escargot
Folks are in a line around the block
Just to see her do the Can-Can-Jacques

You zombie
Be born again my friend
Won? t you sign in stranger

Find your fortune on this lucky star
The chances are good
You will cry if you make it back alive

Or maybe you would like to see the show
You? ll enjoy the cafe d? escargot
Folks are in a line around the block
Just to see her do the Can-Can-Jacques

You zombie
Be born again my friend
Won? t you sign in stranger
