Hey, do you need a reason
Is there a separate season
From which to come out of the spring
I wait all summer long
And then the winter's long
Then it's longer than afterwards
I don't need a timekeeper
I don't need an interlocuter
And baby you'll look a little cuter
Day by day, day by day
If you need a trademark for your sound
You'd better look around
Treat it like a window not a do-o-or
And we'll get some more ...yeah
Baby I could be a squirt
Loosen up your magic dirt
Waiting for the excellent coming of age
Maybe then you'd squirt along
Squirt along, squirt along
Whattcha wanna do
So easily fooled
You are so easily fooled
So easily fooled
Come on now, marry me
Please marry me
Hey, I just want some respect
I might be enough to cover you up
And hold you down
Next to me and then run you around
Look at me once you might see that the color is red
Blurring up your eyes and your head
Coppertones and empire home
Everybody needs a home
Takes centuries to build
And seconds to fall
I wait so patiently for you to fall fall fall fall
But you never fall
Jimmy coconut
I am the coconut, etc
Buying the coconut, etc
