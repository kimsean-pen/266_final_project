Lights, cars and people on the street
Fated meetings and every soul in between
It's hard to stay awake and hard to fall asleep
In the heated battle we cherish the kiss

Running and running and running don't run and hide
There is a feeling inside that would never die

Loneliness tastes so good
Randomly I split in two
I paint my memories in blue
No matter what I will get through

Broken conversation and the silence speaks
Jaded feelings make out with the violin
It's hard to take a break and hard to persevere
In the darkest hour we'll remember this

Running and running and running don't run and hide
There is a feeling inside that would never die

Loneliness tastes so good
Randomly I split in two
I paint my memories in blue
No matter what I will get through

Loneliness tastes so good
Randomly I split in two
I paint my memories in blue
No matter what I will get through

Loneliness taste so good
Randomly I split in two
I paint my memories in blue
No matter what I will get through
