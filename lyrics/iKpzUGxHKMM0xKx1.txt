I'm still in love,
But I'm going through a lot lately,
I hope you trust my prayers and thoughts daily, I still want this,
And I know I've changed a little bit,
If I admit this,
But I'm afraid that you'd hate me if you
knew, That I've become insensitive, It's true,
But even if you do,
None of this has been about you,
None of this has been about you,
None of this has been about you,
It may be wrong,
But I won't give you excuses,
All that I want,
I'm not the one to choose it,
It won't make it okay,
There's nothing I can say,
But anyway,
I'm afraid that you would hate me if you
knew, That I've become insensitive, It's true,
But even if you do,
None of this has been about you,
None of this has been about you,
None of this has been about you,
When I landed in Atlanta you called a
little late, I took to long to answer,
And said I was delayed,
But I never left the gate,
And anyway,
None of this has been about you,
None of this has been about you,
None of this has been about you,
None of this has been about you
