Escaping to the beyond
Mastering all things beyond the dark

Broken through the final dimension
My body is energy a fluid extension
Of one's absolution, of one's final form
This new version of me I truly adore

There is only connection only me, myself and I
Anything my mind can design it all takes form before my eyes
I can control it all
This is my final form

At moment's notice I move within time
No effort of motion only incredible design
All the feelings I once felt within I now allow to take control
Upmost absolution within
Breaking beyond the bodies skin

Replaying all moments in time
At any time I may desire
In the palm of my hand I hold the answer of life
Now I am the fucking cancer

Escaping to the beyond
Mastering all things beyond the dark

There is only connection only me myself and I
Anything my mind can design it all takes form before my eyes
I can control it all
This is my final form

Broken through the final dimension
My body is energy a fluid extension
Of one's absolution of one's final form
This new version of me I truly adore

Power is not the word to describe one's self
There is no definition to explain
I hold together the bonds of immortal reign

And I remain whole at last
Free from pain

At moment's notice I move within time
No effort of motion only incredible design
All the feelings I one's felt within I'd allow to take control
Upmost absolution within
Breaking beyond the bodies skin

Replaying all moments in time
At any time I may desire
In the palm of my hand I hold the answer of life
Now I am the fucking cancer

I am the fucking cancer

Broken through the final dimension
My body is energy a fluid extension
Of one's absolution of one's final form
This new version of me I truly adore
