Watch a tear fall, let them fall, and I'll
Make the seas calm, take you in my arms
You cry
(Let your tears fall)
(Let your tears fall)
(Let your tears fall)
It's not a crime to fall apart sometimes
It's not a crime to ask why, to ask why
You cry
(Let your tears fall)
(Let your tears fall)
(Let your tears fall)

I will come, no I won't run
I'm not scared to care
Come to me when you're in need, set it free
Let the truth breathe

Tell me all your secrets, tell me your fears
I won't push you away, I'll only pull you near

Tell me all your secrets, share in your pain
Confess it all in me, no matter tell me your name
No, I won't judge you, I'mma help you through

And you can call whenever you need me
