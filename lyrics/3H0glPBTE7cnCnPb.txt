I've been driving in this California sun
I've been on the run
Just to get a moment with you
I've been working on these isles all night long
When I hear that song that makes me think of you

I've been sipping on some California wine
Everything feels fine when I'm surrounded by you
I've been?? on some California couch
When thinking bout my life
How everything revolves around you, round you

I've been driving in this California sun
I've been on the run
Just to get a moment with you
I've been working on these isles all night long
When I hear that song that makes me think of you, of you
