It's wonderful
Everywhere, so white
The river has frozen over
Not a soul on the ice
Only me skating fast
I'm speeding past trees
Leaving little lines in the ice
Cutting out little lines in the ice
Splitting, splitting sound
Silver heels spitting, spitting snow

There's something moving under
Under the ice, moving under ice
Through water
Trying to get out of the cold water
(It's me)
(It's me)
Something, someone help them
(It's me)
