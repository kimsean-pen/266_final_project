Black out all the stars
Throw away the key
Turn the sign to closed
Over & out

Fold away the sun
I thought you were the one
Like words that lose their ink
Over & out

Where did you go?
I'm calling off the party
Been searching for too long
Over & out now
When did we lose control?
Was it in the winter?
I'm sick of wondering
Over & out now

Scratch off the tattoo
A face that looks like you
The blood drips down my arm
Over & out

And memories keep choking me
I'll leave them where they are
Over & out

Where did you go?
I'm calling off the party
Been searching for too long
Over & out now
When did we lose control?
Was it in the winter?
I'm sick of wondering
Over & out now

Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did we go?
Where did we go?

Where did you go?
I'm calling off the party
Been searching for too long
Over & out now
When did we lose control?
Was it in the winter?
I'm sick of wondering
Over & out now
