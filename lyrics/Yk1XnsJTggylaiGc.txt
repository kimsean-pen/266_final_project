Shiver through the fever,
silence of the trees.
Chasing woes of my weary soul,
blight of the leaves.
Rest from your troubles,
lay while you wait.
Dream something beautiful.
Fill these blank pages
with rue, each one.
Patient you stayed by my side for years.
I know i owe you more than I have.
Given the words that will make you leave,
there's nothing left here, no one to save.
How we share this hopeless devotion,
passing the hours as if they were days.
And I won't breathe until it's over.
No turning back here,
no final escape.
Bide here for the closing,
fearless by the sea.
Time to let go of what always' been there,
peacefully.
Struck by your silence,
drenched in my doubt,
numb from the burning cold.
Tear out the pages,
change what I sayed,
mend my wrong.
Patient you stayed by my side for years.
I know i owe you more than I have.
Given the words that will make you leave,
there's nothing left here, no one to save.
How we share this hopeless devotion,
passing the hours as if they were days.
And I won't breathe until it's over.
No turning back here,
no final escape.
