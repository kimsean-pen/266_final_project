Like you were eating sleeping pills
You don't know what you've got until
It's gone
And you're willing to kill
Tomorrow and today

Now you could cut a worm in two
Who never really bothered you
And find below a cherry moon
The price that I had paid

The majors
The billboards
The science of sleep
The workers with clocks and trainees
You'll find below a cherry moon

The show cats
And midgets
Who fall to their knees
With pagers and big smoking trees
You'll find below a cherry moon

Without a rhythm or a song
And nothing real to lean upon
The ones who never did belong
Will wind up in the hay

The ones who really did you in
Were bound to give you up to win
The war designed for sickening
That blew us all away

The ones who really did you in
Were bound to give you up to win
The war designed for sickening
That blew us all away

The meat pack district
The drums and the beat
The red lights that make us believe
You'll find below a cherry moon

The hood rat merits
With all certainty
We'll end up as beggars and thieves
You'll find below a cherry moon

Without a rhythm or a song
And nothing real to lean upon
The ones who never did belong
Will wind up in the hay

The ones who really did you in
Were bound to give you up to win
The war designed for sickening
That blew us all away

Without a rhythm or a song
And nothing real to lean upon
The ones who never did belong
Will wind up in the hay
