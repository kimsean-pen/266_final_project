A murder in the dark
The convent in the night
The constable is on the way
The suspect out of sight
He trampled down the garden lane
The mystery has begun
He signed it by the pentagram
And now is on the run

I gotta tell you a story, and the story we start right at the scene of the crime
Another murder and tonight he's left in time
Another victim has gone, another inhuman slaughter on the lane of a park
And still the chief inspector tumbling in the dark

At night I saw him
Can you recall him?
And not a soul has called

Murder at midnight
The enemy on the way
Murder at midnight
Will he return with the day?
Murder at midnight
The Devil's seed on the way
Murder at midnight
And then we tell you to pray
Midnight!
Midnight!

He must have done it alone, he is a master of hiding and he left not a trace
And by the moonlight saw the goat shape of his face
He got an interrogation and they tried hard to break him but it couldn't be prooved
The only trace they couldn't find was cloven hooved

At night I saw him
The phantom crawling
And not a soul has called

Murder at midnight
The enemy on the way
Murder at midnight
Will he return with the day?
Murder at midnight
The Devil's seed on the way
Murder at midnight
And then we tell you to pray

Murder at midnight
The enemy on the way
Murder at midnight
Will he return with the day?
Murder at midnight
The Devil's seed on the way
Murder at midnight
And then we tell you to pray
