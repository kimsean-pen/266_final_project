Well I'm-a going back down maybe one more time, deep down home, October road.
And I might like to see that little friend of mine that I left behind once upon a time.
Oh, promised land and me still standing, it's a test of time, it's a real good sign.

Let the sun run down right behind the hill,
I know how to stand there still till the moon rise up
right behind the pine, oh, Lord, October road.

Let the sun run down right behind the hill,
I know how to stand there still till the moon rise up
right behind the pine, oh, Lord, October road.

It's the big-time life that I can't abide, raise my rent, tan my hide.
Sweet call of the countryside, go down slow, open wide.
I did my time and it changed my mind, I'm satisfied, oh.
I got so low down, fed up, my God, I could hardly move.
Won't you come on, my brother, get on up and help me find my groove.

Keep me walking, October road. Keep me walking in the sunshine, yeah
A little friend of mine, October road.
Keep me walking, October road. Keep me walking in the sunshine, yeah.
A little friend of mine, October road, help me now.
