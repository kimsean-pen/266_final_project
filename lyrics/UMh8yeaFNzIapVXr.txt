Hands on the wheel
All is straight ahead
Left behind
Second guessing all that I once said

I once said, ohhh...
I once said, ohhh...

My spirit is burned and there's blood on my hands
The more I'm down, the less I understand
Once so found, now I'm so lost
I ask no questions, it's just one more bridge to cross

Always black and white
Wouldn't change even if I could
I'll take what I'm handed
Whether it's damned or if it's good

If it's good, ohh...
If it's good, ohh...

My spirit is burned and there's blood on my hands
The more I'm down, the less I understand
Once so found, now I'm so lost
I ask no questions, it's just one more bridge to cross

My spirit is burned and there's blood on my hands
The more I'm down, the less I understand
Once so found, now I'm so lost
I ask no questions, it's just one more bridge to cross
I ask no questions, it's just one more bridge to cross
I ask no questions, it's just one more bridge to cross
