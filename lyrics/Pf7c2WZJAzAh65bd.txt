It doesn't have to be this way,
We're different, still the same,
Move your mind to a higher state,
You and I,
We are higher...
We are higher...
Push through and climb to a higher ground...
When you're reaching your limit and feeling resentment from how it falls,
You thought something was in it but now it's beginning to break apart,
You gotta fight to rise above...
Feel emotion get triggered and figure there's something blocking the road,
But I know that a flicker gets bigger I know that I'm not alone,
You gotta fight to rise above...
It doesn't have to be this way,
We're different, still the same,
Move your mind to a higher state,
You and I,
We are higher...
We are higher...
Push through and climb to a higher ground...
Higher, higher than myself,
Higher, higher than anything else,
Cause I dream of the day we can say that we changed us-
We are equal...
We are equal...
HIGHER and EQUAL
