When no one else can understand me
When everything I do is wrong
Youvgive me hope and consolation
You give me strength to carry on
And you're always there to lend a hand in everything I do

That's the wonder
The wonder of you
(Wonder of you)

And when you smile the world is brighter
You touch my hand and I'm a king,
Your kiss to me is worth a fortune
Your love for me is everything

I guess I'll never know
The reason why
You love me as you do
That's the wonder
(That's the wonder)
the wonder of you

Ohooohooo
Ohooohooo
Ohooohooo

I guess I'll never know the reason why
You love me as you do
That's the wonder
The wonder of you
