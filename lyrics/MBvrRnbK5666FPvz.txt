It don't matter when you turn
Gonna survive
You live and learn
I've been thinking about you, baby
By the light of dawn

A midnight blue, day and night
I've been missing you
I've been thinking about you, baby
Almost makes me crazy
Come and live with me

Either way, win or lose
When you're born into trouble
You live the blues
I've been thinking about you, baby
See it almost makes me crazy

Child, nothing's right, if you ain't here
I'll give all that I have just to keep you near
I wrote you a letter, I tried to make it clear
That you just don't believe that I'm sincere
I've been thinking about you, baby

Plans and schemes
Hopes and fears
Dreams that deny for all these years
I, I've been thinking about you, baby
Living with me, well

I've been thinking about you, baby
Makes me wanna

Child, nothing's right, if you ain't here
I'll give all that I have just to keep you near
I wrote you a letter, darling, tried to make it clear
Oh, but you just don't believe that I'm sincere
I've been thinking about you, baby
I want you to live with me, well
I've been thinking about you, baby
I want you to live with me
