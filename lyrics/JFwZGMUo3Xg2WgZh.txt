Behold the new design
Demonic worlds align
A new beginning, a world that was frozen in time
No thought of compromise
The smell of blood, stirring emotion
So darkly devoted, I have become

They yearn for genocide
Running from their fear of the dark
A new bleeding, a moment of turning the tide
A mortal enemy, fighting with eternal devotion
Becoming the nightmare they're running from

I...
Have fallen once before tonight
And I know... my
Mistake won't be repeated

Then you'll know why
You are burning alive
You're becoming unwhole
Now you will know what it's like
To become the animal

(become the animal)

A bloody legacy
Branded by the hunger within
A new meaning, a moment of felling the pain
A deadly tragedy, the last bit of sanity died
For what's inside of me
You will know your fear of the dark
And you now will be hunted, so flee before...

I...
Have fallen once before tonight
And I know my
Mistake won't be repeated

Then you'll know why
You are burning alive
You're becoming unwhole
Now you will know what it's like
To become the animal

Then you'll know why
You are burning alive
You're becoming unwhole
Now you will know what it's like
To become the animal

Then you'll know why
You are burning alive
You're becoming unwhole
Now you will know what it's like
To become the animal
