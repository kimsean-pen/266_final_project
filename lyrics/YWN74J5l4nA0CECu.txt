Laying in my bed all day
Hear nothing but the sound of rain
I'm under covers tonight, I feel so cold
I wish that you would come around
'Cause I'm sorry that I let you down
Turn back the clocks and have you here to hold

I regret the moment I saw you
Enter my lips on his, that fatal kiss
Intoxicated, I wasn't thinking straight
With my lips on his, that fatal kiss

Your eyes cut to the core of me
Oh, why did I give it all up for one night?
Tell me you won't let me go
Oh, your eyes crying an ocean
Oh, why did I give it all up for one night?
Tell me you still love me so
Tell me you still love me so

You used to make me feel so free
But now you got a hold on me
You're the one my body wants
But not what my heart needs
It feels like a million years
Since we had it all, no fears
Now I'm scared to get too close
In case you make me bleed

I regret the moment I saw you
Enter my lips on his, that fatal kiss
Intoxicated, I wasn't thinking straight
With my lips on his, that fatal kiss

Your eyes cut to the core of me
Oh, why did I give it all up for one night?
Tell me you won't let me go
Oh, your eyes crying an ocean
Oh, why did I give it all up for one night?
Tell me you still love me so
Tell me you still love me so

Let's get back together again
Could we make it better again?
All that I want is your hand

Your eyes cut to the core of me
Oh, why did I give it all up for one night?
Tell me you won't let me go
Your eyes crying an ocean
Oh, why did I give it all up for one night?
Tell me you still love me so

Oh, your eyes cut to the core of me
Oh, why did I give it all up for one night?
Tell me you won't let me go (Tell me that you won't let me go)
Oh, your eyes crying an ocean
Oh, why did I give it all up for one night? (one night)
Tell me you still love me so
Tell me you still love me so
