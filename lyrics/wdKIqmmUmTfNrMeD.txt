We've both been acting strangely
And you can hardly face me
And I can see no fire in your eyes
We both know the answer
But one of us won't say it
Love's the only game in town
You sure know how to play it
The future of our love is on the line
The both of us could lose more than we find
So turn around and count to ten
Before you lose the only one who really loves you
Somebody who likes you just as you are
Now how you might have been, oh baby
When you turn around again
I might be with someone else who really loves me
And now I'll say, what I don't want to say
I'll have you back again, I want you back

And if we think about it and come to the conclusion
That I want you, and you want me, we've come to the solution
And I cannot deny it, you were my perfect lover
If paradise is half as nice, I'd never find another
And now it's time, for making up your mind
The future is ahead don't look behind
So turn around and count to ten
Before you lose the only one who really loves you
Somebody who likes you just as you are
Now how you might have been
When you turn around again
I might be with someone else who really loves me
And now I'll say what I don't want to say
I'll have you back again
I want your love in my hands where I can feel it
Love in my heart, where I can keep it warm
Turn up your radio now
I'm calling out your name

What we've got cannot be left behind
It's time for you to tell me that you're mine
So turn around and count to ten
Before you lose the only one who really loves you
Somebody who likes you just as you are
Now how you might have been, ho baby
When you turn around again
I might be with someone else who really loves me
And now I'll say, what I don't want to say
I'll have you back again, I want you back
In my life where I can hold you
Back in my dreams,
where I can keep you warm
Here on my lips where I can taste your candy kiss
