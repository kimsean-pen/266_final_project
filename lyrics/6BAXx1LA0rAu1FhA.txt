Well, I got my mind out of sight
lost the common sense,
got a rave in my brain
like i'm without defense.

Till I catch my eyes right in front of me,
It's a bloke of a man, fine as he can be.
Hey cute from the left, oh yeah
Why'd his move he had me shake out a lie
He really had it going...

The crowd's getting thinner
we are getting closer,
with a hole in my head
he took me to his sofa...

Well now the sun ain't shining no more,
I don't know why but I've seen it before.
Ain't got no joy no man to lean on,
He leaves my soul on the floor like a doll.

He was young, he was hot,
he made me feel alive.
so in love I was falling,
ooh, it's early morning.

He took me in his hands
and squeezed me real tight.
I was humbled, so joyful
but depending on this guy
he didn't last very long,
a week or maybe two.
when he called me on the phone
saying baby I don't love you.

Just another lonely love
always giving never get.
And now I feel so stupid
it's like a deja vu ooooooo

Because the sun ain't shining no more,
I don't know why but I've seen it before.
Ain't got no joy no man to lean on,
He leaves my soul on the floor like a doll.

Oh no the sun ain't shining no more,
I don't know why but I've seen it before.
Ain't got no joy no man to lean on,
He leaves my soul on the floor like a doll.

Yeah, yeaaahhhh...

For a while I'm shining
but later I'm crying.
I'm sick and stronger,
I'm always getting weaker.

For a while I'm shining
but later I'm crying
I'm sick and stronger
I'm always getting weaker

Yeah now the sun ain't shining no more,
I don't know why but I've seen it before.
Ain't got no joy no man to lean on,
He leaves my soul on the floor like a doll.
