Wo-oah woah-oh
Wo-oah oh
Wo-oah woah-oh
Wo-oah oh

I've been around the block, I know a thing or two
I've got experience
Yeah I'm talking to you
And anything I've lost, you know I'll buy it back
Sweetheart I'm serious
Just like a heart attack

I'm the boss (ayy), applesauce (ayy)
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a wicked witch
Bang zoom (ayy), to the moon (ayy)
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a wicked witch
(battle axe, battle axe, battle axe, battle axe)

Wo-oah woah-oh
Wo-oah oh
Wo-oah woah-oh
Wo-oah oh

I got the casting call, you got the casting couch
I've got the upper hand
Your head is in the clouds
And you know all the youth is wasted only young
You're livin' for the likes, I do it for the love

I'm the boss (ayy), applesauce (ayy)
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a wicked witch
Bang zoom (ayy), to the moon (ayy)
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a wicked witch
(battle axe, battle axe, battle axe, battle axe)

Wo-oah woah-oh
Wo-oah oh
Wo-oah woah-oh
Wo-oah oh
(battle axe, battle axe, battle axe)

I see you crusin' for a bruisin'
I see you crusin' for a bruisin'
(laughter)

Wo-oah woah-oh
Wo-oah oh
Wo-oah woah-oh
Wo-oah oh
