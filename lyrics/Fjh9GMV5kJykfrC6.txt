Welcome to the world you see
An AK with a couple magazines
Whose blood it is don't matter to me
Scatter the ashes of the seven seas
That sickness, that feeling inside you
That's weakness, don't let it divide you
Keep this, that feeling of pride too
Digging up bones whilst you bury the truth
Your children, hypocrisy
That's what I give, you can take it from me
If you don't, we'll live to see
One last act of tragedy
No mother's heart can make me humble
No life lost can make me stumble
Our empire will never crumble

We did it for the glory
The glory, only the glory
We live and die the story
It's our story, all for the glory

Bullets begin to strip
A man of reason, he's a man of sin
The men of treason are the ones who live
They'll take what you've got, what you've got to give
An empire, a trial by fire
There are liars lighting funeral pyres
The letter to a mother from across the sea
A son in a box buried beneath
For whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee
For whom they smile when they put you to sleep
A deal with the devil is a deal with me
That deal is forever, as long as you breathe
Go forth, child, make us proud
Honor is yours underground
Know we loved you, lay you down

We did it for the glory
The glory, only the glory
We live and die the story
It's our story, all for the glory

Nobody runs, nobody runs
Nobody runs or makes it out alive
Nobody runs, nobody runs
Nobody runs or makes it out alive

Hearts beating faster, running to the front lines
Nobody runs or makes it out alive
Look up to heaven as it rains from the sky
Nobody runs or makes it out alive
Out alive...

Because we did it for the glory
The glory, only the glory
We live and die the story
It's our story, all for the glory

The glory, the glory, the glory
We did it for the glory
The glory, all for the glory
