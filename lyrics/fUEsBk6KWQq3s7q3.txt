Stand a little
From your head
Broken birdie
Lost its voice

Black, black lightening
Broken chord (Record, record, record)
Playful baby
Swan-soft land

Crying picture
Sorry hum
Lonesome sparrow
Little bird

Levelly... let the weakling go to air

Stand a little
From your head
Broken birdie
Lost its voice

Crying picture
Sorry hum (Some lovely song it knows)
Lonesome sparrow
Little bird

Singing of its
Pity peep
Lying shattered
Gram-a-phone

Open papa
Wholesome tones (Only tries the softer ones)
Lonesome sleeping
Sailing free

Levelly...

(Broken record: Broken record)
(Broken record: Broken record)
Let the weakling go to air
Let the weakling go to air
