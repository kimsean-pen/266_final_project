If paradise is half as nice as heaven that you take me to.
Who needs paradise, I'd rather have you.
They say, paradise is up in the stars,
but I needn't sigh because it's so far,
'Cos I know it's worth a heaven on earth
To me, where you are.
A look from your eyes, a touch of your hand,
And I seem to fly to some other land.
Whe nyou are around, my heart always pounds
Just like a brass band.
If paradise is half as nice as heaven ...
A look from your eyes ...
