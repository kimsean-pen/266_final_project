Rage from a distant
The name unfamiliar
Spikes reach the heart
Time set for rewind

The dark will rise
Abandon your freedom
Give up the right to find the true self
Forsake your own reasons

Forsaker
Forsaker

Hand of a leader
Bleached by snowfall
Position is a drug
The great end is sweeping in

The dark will rise
Abandon your freedom
Give up the right to find the true self
Forsake your own reasons

Forsaker
