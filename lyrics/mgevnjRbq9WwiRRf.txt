Hate to burst your bubble, bitch
I'm that weird girl that's runnin' shit
I'm a boss bitch runnin' big shit
Got a company, need a couple mil'
Ain't no rap talk, this my real life
And that's on God, I almost died twice
So I go 'head, and I get mine
And I cash checks, and I get fly
Pelle Pelle with the VB belt
Skinny jeans and a studded belt
I've been fly, never needed help
I been me, ain't nobody else
Skinny jeans and a pair of Vans
Pants sag 'til they hit my ass
Lit, lit, I'ma do my dance
Like a raver bitch goin' in a trance
Edru, I'm a skater boy
Anime and a lot of tours
MySpace, made a lot of noise
That's middle school and I'm actin' caught
Back of the class, they sending my ass
Roll up my skirt and they think that I'm fast
I got no ass and I got no titties
But all of your dudes, they hit me to hit me

Hold up a minute
You know I ain't did it
That is your man
And that ain't my business
So come for me different
You can make fun of me
But my bank account statement is somethin'
Is somethin', is somethin' to see
I've been down with the shits
The rap shit I do it, you bet
I ain't the best
But damn I'm the best
You might get hit
Or you might get checked
So don't disrespect
Or it will be hit for the neck

This shit is the illest
This that Scream 3, finna kill shit
I'm a rap boo and a misfit
And I throw 'bows in the moshpit
I bump bump that Gangsta Boo
That Loco, that La Chat
I respect that trill shit
And them OGs that really rap
I'm already back with some new shit
You Dionne and I'm clueless
I got my own movement
I do this, I move shit
I change rap forever, man
It's me who had the biggest plan
Ain't no average bitch, I've been the man
I've been the G.O.A.T, eatin' off the land
It's me who took the weirdo shit
To another level, and I'm killin' it
They ain't want me, that's beginnin-ish
Now I'm too hot and they suck my dick
