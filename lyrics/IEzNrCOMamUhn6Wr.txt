underworld (whispered throughout the intro)

They said the meek shall inherit the earth
oh god that seems like so much work
I want to sing and dream and drink and cry
and let this night pass me by

oh take me to the future, I'm ready
my affection is so unsteady
I can think up tomorrow
I can sleep through today
as the sun melts the ice caps away

I'll carry your cross now baby
it's a blasphemous world today
we are the tender missionaries
from the underworld, USA

It is so easy to confess
when you are guilty of nothing less
than a crooked, wretched,
stupid, tepid indifference

yeah, take me to your bedroom, I'm ready
my complexion is so unsteady
I remember tomorrow
I forget yesterday
I want to move into your body and stay

I'll carry your cross now baby
it's a blasphemous world today
we are the tender missionaries
from the underworld, USA

I'll bury your pain now baby
are you happier now, happier now?
In the tender cemetery
where we always are here to stay

They said the meek shall inherit the earth
oh I want to know what it's all worth
with a knife in my back and a star in my eye
oh let this life pass me by

Can you take me to your heaven, I'm ready
I know the weight of my heart is too heavy
I will love you with all of the love that I have
even if that means there's none left for me

I'll carry your cross now baby
it's a blasphemous world today
we are the tender missionaries
from the underworld, USA

I'll bury your pain now baby
are you happier now, happier now?
in the tender cemetery
where we always are here to stay
