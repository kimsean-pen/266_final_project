Leave
Leave me all alone to grieve
You've said your peace and now the walls are moving
It's like the room has come alive

Home
This will no longer feel like home
And I swear these sheets are trying to suffocate me
I can't shake this, something's not right

I'm just a sleepwalker waking up
All of the memories were never quite enough
I'm just a sleepwalker waking up
Waking up

How could you be so sure of it?
You didn't even have to blink your eyes
Said it was never enough, it's never been enough

I would say I would disagree
But what's the point of saying anything?
I was thinking on the way home

That I'm just a sleepwalker waking up
All of the memories were never quite enough
I'm just a sleepwalker waking up
Waking up

We were waiting for the train
The day you turned to me and said
That you were tired of the chase
And I was always half awake
I watched you as you walked away
Never even felt the way
But I am finally waking up
You and I were not enough

Hey!

I finally see it as it is
(You were not enough)
I've never needed more than this

I'm just a sleepwalker waking up
All of the memories will never be enough
I'm just a sleepwalker waking up
This little world that I created was a crutch
I'm just a sleepwalker waking up
Waking up
