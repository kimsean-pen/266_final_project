In this moment together
What will you hear in my voice?
All the things unspoken
Won't you come a little nearer
'Cause in here it's so much clearer

There are things I could only tell you quietly
That's why I wanna get inside
And use my inside voice
Ain't to proud to tell you, and girl I hope
That you get the message
When I use my inside voice on you

I ain't gonna scream and shout it
I ain't gonna send it to your phone
Just get in the same room
I ain't gonna write a letter
Cause you'll hear it so much better

There are things I can only tell you quietly
That's why I wanna get inside
And use my inside voice
I ain't to proud to tell you, and girl I hope
That you get the message
When I use my inside voice

Outside
I've got trouble hearing outside
Trouble feeling inside
There's a way to make you see
What you mean to me
Ooooh

There are things I can only tell you quietly
That's why I wanna get inside
And use my inside voice
Ain't to proud to tell you, and girl I hope
That you get the message
When I use my inside voice on you
Oooh

There are things I can only tell you quietly
That's why I wanna get inside
That's why I wanna get inside (inside voice)
That's why I wanna get inside, girl I hope
That you get the message
