I spent all the money I owe
I've got nothing to show for it
I made a black hole inside a black hole
I slept not a minute, oh no
I'm bleeding from my soul again
Is this the end
Before the end, yeah man

Me, and my reality, yeah
I'm screaming at the past but it's laughing at me

So give me back the night
Give me back the night
Give me back, give me back, give me back the night

I'm not making any new friends (oh no)
I'm all alone again (oh yeah)
I'll play pretend inside my head
I watched my idols come and go
Each one they died for rock and roll
So here I go on down that road
Ya man

Well me and my insanity
I'm screaming at the past but it's laughing at me

So give me back the night
Give me back the night
Give me back, give me back, give me back the night
I wanna make it right
So give me back my life
Give me back, give me back, give me back the light

Oh
Oh
Oh
Yeah

I'm singing in the hall of shame
I'm living in the house of pain
I'm singing in the hall of shame
I'm living in the house of pain

It's just me and my reality, yeah
I'm screamin' at the past but its, la la la la la la la la

So give me back the night (give me back)
Give me back the night
Give me back, give me back, give me back the night
I wanna make it right
So give me back my life
Give me back, give me back, give me back the night
