Slowly fading
Burnt like fire in a pyre
Life will disappear with you
And now
All I hear is silence
Somehow
All I wish for faded in the dark

I burn with you
We'll see it through
I burn in you
It will never be the same as it was before
It's true
We'll see it through
I burn in you
But we'll never be the same as we were before

And now
Feel the heat around me
See the blaze that burns me
All of this is tearing me apart

I burn with you
We'll see it through
I burn in you
It will never be the same as it was before
It's true
We'll see it through
I burn in you
But we'll never be the same as we were before

Burning the pyre
Take me in your arms
And start to burn
Yearning for life
Take me in your arms
And start to burn

I burn with you
We'll see it through
I burn in you
It will never be the same as it was before
It's true
We'll see it through
I burn in you
But we'll never be the same as we were before
