I believe in medication
And I believe in therapy
And I believe in crystal light
'Cause I believe in me, yeah
It's so uplifting, fuck yeah

I barely have motivation
They say I suffer from a lack of serotonin
Synapses, they happen too infrequently for me
To be functioning properly

I took the pills
I took the advice
The panic stopped
But still I'm not right
Racing thoughts and wasted time
It's the same old story-line
This is my nursery rhyme
And it goes:

I believe in medication
And I believe in therapy
And I believe in crystal light
'Cause I believe in me, yeah
It's so uplifting, fuck yeah

I'm barely off the medication
And now the walls are closing in again
I can't breathe
And I can't bleed
Will you be my alibi?
Tell them that I truly tried
To give in?

Whoa-oh-oh (hoo hoo)
Whoa-oh-oh (hoo hoo)
Whoa-oh-oh (hoo hoo)
Whoa-oh-oh...
