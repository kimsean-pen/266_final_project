You walk around the old neighbourhood
But your heart's not in it
Nonchantly pointing out the coffee shop
You made your plans in
The jobs you have to do there

You walk around the new neighbourhood
But your heart's not in it
To learn any more about this country
The apartment you have to live in
They decided that we didn't fit the records that they hold
And we created more

Following the hours ending
You know we have to leave the building
You know we have to leave all the doors unlocked
We know we will not be the last
We know that they have got a plan too

A car for us to drive in
A box for us to die in
A vote for us to write in
An app we all confide in
Making money is horrible
A rotten institution

We're here
We're here
I told you so
I told you so

We're here
We're here
I told you so
I told you so
Like oil in an ocean
Like we loved that poison
Please remember as a person
It's the land that's always foreign

Can you still call it a country?
If all the states are broken
Can you still call it a business?
If all you do is steal
Can you live our marine tigers?
All the boulder rain was made for
We huff and puff but nothing ever comes

There's nothing wrong with Jos—ê
There's nothing wrong with Moses
There's nothing wrong with kindness
There's nothing wrong with knowing

We're here
I told you so
We're here
I told you so
We're here
I told you so
We're here
I told you so
