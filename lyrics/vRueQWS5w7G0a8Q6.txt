You're here, I'm pleased
I really dig your company
Your style, your smile
Your peace mentality

Lord, have mercy on me
I was blind, now I can see
What a king's supposed to be
Baby, I feel free, come on and go with me

Let's take a long walk
Around the park, after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation

Share our situations
Temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations
Maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18

Your background, it ain't squeaky clean
Shit, sometimes we all gotta swim upstream
You ain't no saint, we all are sinners
But you put your good foot down to make your soul the winner

I respect that
Man you're so phat
And you're all that
Plus supreme

Then you're humble
Man I'm numb yo
With feelin'
I can feel everything that you bring

Let's take a long walk
Around the park, after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation

Maybe we can talk about Revelations 3:17

Or maybe we can see a movie
Or maybe we can see a play on Saturday
Or maybe we can roll a tree
And feel the breeze and listen to a symphony
Or maybe chill and just be

Or maybe
Maybe we can take a cruise and listen to The Roots
Or maybe eat some passion fruit
Or maybe, cry to the blues
Or maybe we could just be silent

Come on
Come on

Let's take a long walk
Around the park, after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation

Maybe we can talk about Psalms in entirety
