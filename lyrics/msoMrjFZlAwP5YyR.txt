Well I just got a car for my baby
For a million just where I am
Yet I miss her touch, something crazy
But I'm deep in the blues again

Stuck down on some lonesome highway
Tonight I could sure use a friend
Nothing but darkness is coming my way
And I'm deep in the blues again
Yes I'm deep in the blues again

And I'm driving, always driving
Trying to find my way back home to you
Yeah I'm running, yes I'm running
Gonna find my way back home to you

Where I go there there's no way to find me
I can't let nobody in
When I hear that thunder and lightning
I'll go deep in the blues again
And I'm deep in the blues again

And I'm driving, always driving
Trying to find my way back home to you
Yeah I'm running, yes I'm running
Gonna find my way back for you

I'm so deep in this hole
So dark I'm can't crawl my way back
Yeah so deep in my soul
Like that freight train that rode off the track
And I'm down, down, down
Deep in the blues again

When you hear that preacher stop praying
And you know that you're close to the end
All the those colours they start fading
And you're keeping the blues again
And you're keeping the blues again

And I'm driving, always driving
And I long just to walk and see you
And I'm running, and keep running
Trying to find my way back to you

And I'm driving, always driving
All night long just so I can see you
And I'm running, I keep running
Trying to find my way back to you
And I'm down, down, down
Deep in the blues again
