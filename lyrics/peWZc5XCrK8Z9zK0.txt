She was sugar and salt we all wanted
And one of those queens you need to get
And I got her to go out with me
I took her dancing

In the smoke I believed she's all mine
I was sure (cause) my moves went so fine
Then I asked her to go home with me
Then she looked and me

And she said
Bye bye bye I am not the one night kind
Guess you better find someone
Someone who's like you, just like you
Bye bye bad boy you cannot be fine
You should better find someone
Someone who is sick enough for you

Still I thought there must be some way
To get the kiss and the love just right away
Then I said I would take her straight home
It's not safe out there

Last minute I had to make my move
I said: "Honey could I sleep next to you"
And she said Disappear F***ing idiot
That's all folks. Period.

And she said
Bye bye bye I am not the one night kind
Guess you better find someone, someone who's like you just like you
Bye bye bad boy you cannot be fine
You should better find someone
Someone who is sick enough for you

Bye bye bye I am not the one night kind
Bye bye bye I am not the one night kind
Bye bye bye I am not the one night kind
Bye bye bye I am not the one night kind

Bye bye bye I am not the one night kind
Guess you better find someone, someone who's like you just like you
Bye bye bad boy you cannot be fine
You should better find someone
Someone who is sick enough ...
Someone who is sick enough ...
Someone who is sick enough for you
