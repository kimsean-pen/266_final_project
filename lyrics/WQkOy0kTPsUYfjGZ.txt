You say it's a shame
Then only life is to blame
Your mind is a cold world
Faces may change
Different names
It's the same words
The same gestures
Eye to eye, face to face, lips to lips and tongue to tongue
It's such a cold world

The words that you say
Aren't just a game that you play
Your choice is sincere
But the feelings you show
Make no difference at all
To those
You call the creatures
Eye to eye, face to face, lips to lips and tongue to tongue
It's such a cold world
You call it the communism
Call it the communism
Call it the communism of love
