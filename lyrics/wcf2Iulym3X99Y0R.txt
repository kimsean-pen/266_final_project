Stars live in the evening, but the very young need the sun.
Pretty baby, you look so heavenly.
A neo nebula from under the sun.
I was forming, some say I had my chance.
The boys were falling like an avalanche.
Ya ya baby, "La Dolce Vita" is a magic dance.
No one was listening.
Pretty baby, petite ingenue, teenage starlet, I fell in love with you.
You, you with the comb... you look ok in every way.
Ah... I, I should have known you'd look at me and look away, oh.
Pretty baby, you look so heavenly.
A neo nebula from under the sun.
Eyes that tell me "incense and peppermints"
Your looks are larger than life.
Long live innocence.
Petite ingenue, I fell in love with you.
