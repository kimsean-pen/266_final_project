Public enemy number one
Jailbreak and a smoking gun
You won't believe the things I've done
And the killing is just for fun

Public enemy number one
A stolen car and I'm on the run
Through the night till the rising sun
And the trouble has just begun

Roses on your grave
I'll be on my way
There's no time to stay
With the enemies I've made

I'm invincible
You might say despicable
Punishment's reciprocal
Public enemy number one

I'm unbeatable
My mind is untreatable
Crimes unrepeatable
Public enemy number one

Public enemy number one
Watch the authorities come undone
With every stand-off that I've won
Flirting death just for fun

Public enemy number one
Born a fugitive father's son
Another heist of a bank is done
And the trouble has just begun

Roses on your grave
I'll be on my way
There's no time to stay
With the enemies I've made

I'm invincible
You might say despicable
Punishment's reciprocal
Public enemy number one

I'm unbeatable
My mind is untreatable
Crimes unrepeatable
Public enemy number one

The posters say I'm wanted "dead or dead"
Anyone who's tried got a bullet to the head

I'm invincible
You might say despicable
Punishment's reciprocal
Public enemy number one

I'm unbeatable
My mind is untreatable
Crimes unrepeatable
Public enemy number one

Public enemy
