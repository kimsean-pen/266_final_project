So it started with the immigration information bore
You gotta know
Gambling floor, then to the S.T.U.D.I.O 54
You gotta go

Now we're leaving, L.A.S Vegas two times
Crazy horse too spent us dry
Vietnam vet taxi ride
L.A.S Vegas
So we parked at the ground floor, front door, car hire,
room for four
we gotta go
Rambling slow to the L.A Marquis, all the imitation folk
we gotta go

Now we're leaving L.A.S Vegas two times
Crazy horse too spent us dry
Vietnam vet Taxi ride
L.A.S Vegas

Leave (X4)

Now, we're leaving L.A.S Vegas two times,
crazy horse to spin us dry,
veitnam vet, taxi ride,
come again we'll make you fly,
vietnam vet taxi ride,
crazy horse too spent us dry,
las vegas two times.
