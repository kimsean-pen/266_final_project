To give yourself a little bit of hope's a lie,
you said, "we're just spinning where we stand."
And if you cling to tokens for your life you find
you wind up with imaginary men.
Static transmit me
to the other side of another room in pieces.
Like a steady beating,
the summer hurts. [6x]
The telescopic pull of what you know's a lie,
it's broken down 100, 000 times.
The parts collapse, in caving they're inside the atmosphere,
we're carving out our names into the air.
You are a runner, the steady balance as you're gaining in speed,
a photograph to scale the thrashing of your feet.

beats the tar out of the road you are on until it's won you,
the summer hurts. [6x]
And as for all your suffering you won't escape

The beauty that you breathe into the air won't clear your name
