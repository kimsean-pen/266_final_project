To another commotion
To another disruption
To another explosion
I raise my glass
To another investment
Into the future of wasteland
Well here's to pulling the waistband

But I know at least I thought, at least I fight
At least I know at least I tried
I know I thought, I know I'll fight
Tonight I kiss the world goodbye

We are one, and one is all
Through self-destruction we fall
Close your eyes, to darkened skies
Our ignorant demise

To another obsession
Over another possession
Another deal well made
Well I raise my glass
And to the blissful ignoring
That the unclaimable objects
Decide our pitfall or prospect

I know at least I thought, at least I fight
At least I know at least I tried
I know I thought, I know I'll fight
Tonight I kiss the world goodbye

We are one, as one we fall
Our self-destruction of all
Close your eyes, to darkened skies
Our ignorant demise

This will lead to personal gain
But I won't feel any personal pain
All the global implications in vain
Yes the price is high but so are the stakes
This belongs to all of us so
Really this belongs to no one at all
When it comes to owning up to our fall
Better brace yourself for the end of it all

I know at least I thought, at least I fight
At least I know at least I tried
I know I thought, I know I'll fight
Tonight I kiss the world goodbye

We are one, as one we fall
Our self-destruction of all
Close your eyes, to darkened skies
Our ignorance in demise

We are one, as one we fall
Our self-destruction of all
Close your eyes, to darkened skies
Our ignorant demise
