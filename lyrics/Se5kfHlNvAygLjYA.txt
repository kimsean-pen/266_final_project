When they poured across the border
I was cautioned to surrender
This I could not do
I took my gun and vanished

I have changed my name so often
I've lost my wife and children
But I have many friends
And some of them are with me

An old woman gave us shelter
Kept us hidden in the garret
Then the soldiers came
She died without a whisper

There were three of us this morning
I'm the only one this evening
But I must go on
The frontiers are my prison

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Through the graves the wind is blowing
Freedom soon will come
Then we'll come from shadow

Les allemands e'taient chez moi
Ils me dirent, "signe toi"
Mais je n'ai pas peur
J'ai repris mon Ã¢me

J'ai change' cent fois de nom
J'ai perdu femme et enfants
Mais j'ai tant d'amis
J'ai la france entie're

Un vieil homme dans un grenier
Pour la nuit nous a cache'
Les allemands l'ont pris
Il est mort sans surprise

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Through the graves the wind is blowing
Freedom soon will come
Then we'll come from the shadow
