Don't bend, don't blink
Don't beg, don't scream
Don't whine, don't fight, don't tell me
Don't tell me, don't tell me

Don't feel, don't tear
Don't kiss, don't care
Don't touch, don't want me
Don't want me, don't want me

Something's so sick about this
My misery is so addictive
I'm halfway there with your Northshore
From the floor singing to you over my shoulder

Don't run, don't hide
Don't hurt, don't lie
Don't breathe, don't try, don't find me
Don't find me, don't find me

Don't cringe, don't clinch
Don't look, don't flinch
Don't know, don't go, don't leave me
Don't leave me, don't leave me

Something's so sick about this
My misery is so addictive
I'm halfway there with your Northshore
From the floor singing to you over my shoulder

Don't sing, don't talk
Don't yell, don't laugh
Don't think, don't speak, don't save me
Don't save me, don't save me

Don't stay, don't plan
Don't heal, don't mend
Don't take, don't send, don't love me
Don't love, don't love me

Something's so sick about this
My misery is so addictive
I'm halfway there with your Northshore
From the floor singing to you over my shoulder

Something's so sick about this
My misery is so addictive
I'm halfway there with your Northshore
From the floor singing to you over my shoulder

Something's so sick about this
My misery is so addictive
I'm halfway there with your Northshore
From the floor singing to you over my shoulder

Something's so sick about this
My misery is so addictive
I'm halfway there with your Northshore
From the floor singing to you over my shoulder
