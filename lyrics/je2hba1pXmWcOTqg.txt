He's back in 94
He needs a better road
He always needs more
He's back in 94
He's back in 94
Walks like a shadow
He's dancing all alone

I'm going back to the places we've uncovered
I've got to return to a time I'll keep forever
I've got to gather a simple collection
Of all the sensations I felt before
Out of my fantasy
Back to my consciousness
Trying to catch all the colors that faded
They're floating above my head
I want them down

He's back in 94
He needs a better road
He always needs more
He's back in 94
He's back in 94
Walks like a shadow
He's dancing all alone

I know by heart
All the talks and the history
All of the feelings
Just passed out my memory
It's slipping out of my mind
It's slipping out of my mind
Out of my fantasy
Back to my consciousness
Trying to catch all the colors that faded
They're floating above my head
I want them down

He's back in 94
He needs a better road
He always needs more
He's back in 94
He's back in 94
Walks like a shadow
He's dancing all alone
