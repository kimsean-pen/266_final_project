Every raw material at hand
Remember all the things you said you'd do?
...?
What happens next?
What happens now?
What happens next?
And the need for a book...?
Conditioned by steps...
One
Two
Three
Four
Often seems that opportunity knocks
When the door is bolted
The door is locked
The door is bolted
And the door is locked
Don't take me by the hand
Don't take me by the hand
Don't take me by the hand
Don't take me by the hand
Don't take me by the hand
Don't take me by the hand
The tools of the trade are the head and the heart
And the joke I know
And the joke I know
And the joke I know
What I will be when I grow up
If I grow up
When I grow up
Throw away the brainwash
Throw away the brainwash
Throw away the brainwash
(And I give up)
Don't give up
(And I give up)
Don't give up
(And I give up)
Don't give up
Don't give in

Learn how!
Learn how!
Learn how!
