I wanna go back to it
I wanna backtrack to it
And if there's a path to it
I'd have to forget what you did

Tell me that you're sorry
And I promise to try to forgive
Tell me you still want me
And maybe I could be a little less sensitive

I wanna go back to it
I wanna backtrack to it
And if there's a path to it
I'd have to forget what you did

If you could acknowledge
That you left me here guarding the door
And hold me like you used to
Then maybe I could feel less insecure

I wanna go back to it
I wanna backtrack to it
And if there's a path to it
I'd have to forget what you did

Did you even bother
To understand how I might feel
How do I make sense of
What feels like we're pretending
And what feels real

I wanna go back to it
I wanna backtrack to it
And if there's a path to it
I'd have to forget what you did
