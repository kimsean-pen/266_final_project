(I've got it, yeah I've got it, yeah I've got it)

I've got a fire in me
There's so much I have to see
From where I was before
To how far I've yet to go
I'm gonna raise my hands
Gonna take a stand
Gonna turn my voice up loud

I'm glow in the dark now
Glow in the dark now, now, now
Glow in the dark now
I'm glow in the dark now, now, now, now

(I've got it, now, now, now, now, I've got it, yeah I've got it, I've got it)

I've got a fire in me
It's so bright I can't believe
I was ever scared before of things I could not control
I'm gonna raise my hands
Gonna take a stand
Gonna turn my voice up loud

I'm glow in the dark now
Glow in the dark now, now, now
Glow in the dark now
I'm glow in the dark now, now, now, now

Strange light, follow as it burns
Strange life, of unexpected turns
You fight on and even if you fall...
You get back up again

I'm glow in the dark now
(Some hearts you'll never win)
Glow in the dark now, now, now
(And some pain never ends)
Glow in the dark now
(But these are the shoes you're walkin' in)
I'm glow in the dark now, now, now, now
(So just get back up again)
Now, now, now, now
(get back up again)
Now, now, now, now
(I've got it, yeah I've got it)
