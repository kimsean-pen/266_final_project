How cold is the heart
My world is on fire
How deep is the mark
When you leave and your dream turn to water
I let myself feel
I'm wishing for something real

We are
We are
Chasing a shadow
We are
We are
Lost in the shame
You try to hide only to reach out
It's too late

With a smile you move on
Every fear left unspoken
There was hope
Now it's gone
So believe there is love in the open
You just have to let go and turn into something real

We are
We are
Chasing a shadow
We are
We are
Lost in the shame
You try to hide only to reach out
It's too late

Break the shade
See your hate
Black flames
No names
Who are you?
Janette said.

We are
We are
Chasing a shadow
We are
We are
Lost in the shame
You try to hide only to reach out
It's too late
