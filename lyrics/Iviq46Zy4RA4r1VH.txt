Falling on a...
Following a new nation
The days are growing up
Made for, our life are moments
Cover all the sky with lights
The wind is painful, raging
True love confusion
Senses are blowing up miles high
Get mixed up, get danger
let's merge up the the sky with lights

On the vertical streets
We go up up (up up)
With our eyes set to leap
Glowing with love love (up up)
In the spiral cities
Let's get lost 'cause
We count stars

Follow the procession
Walking in a new nation
The days are growing up
Made for, our life in moments
Everything's painful, danger
Our eyes are open

On the vertical streets
We go up up (up up)
With our eyes set to leap
Glowing with love love (up up)
In the spiral cities
Let's get lost 'cause
We count stars

Senses are blowing up miles high
Get mixed up get danger
let's merge up the sky with lights

On the vertical streets
We go up up (up up)
With our eyes set to leap
Glowing love love
In the spiral cities
Let's get lost 'cause
we count stars
In the spiral cities
We go up up (up up)
