I got somethin' up my sleeve
(I know you will cover me)
Inside out and in between
(I know you will cover me)
I've got bruises on my knees
(I know you will cover me)
Inside out and in between
(And I know you will cover me, yea, yea)

Run away
Make haste
And get laid
We get laid
You turn me up
I've had enough
So medicate

Medicate
I'm already incomplete
(I know you will cover me)
Broken by your empathy
(I know you will cover me)
I've been lyin' here for weeks
(I know you will cover me)
Inside out and in between

(And I know you will cover me, yea, yea)
Run away
Make haste
And get laid
We get laid
You turn me up
I've had enough

So medicate
Medicate
Run away
Make haste
And get laid
We get laid
You turn me up
I've had enough

So medicate
Medicate, yea, yea
Run away
Make haste
And get laid
We get laid
You turn me up
I've had enough
So medicate
Medicate
