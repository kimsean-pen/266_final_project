Enchanted, enchanted
This magical place that we've found
No one here but us and the sound
Of the stars and the night owls
Your breath and the rolling clouds
Enchanted, I am, by you

Now love has come to me
And set apart thee
From all of the maddening crowds
The orchard is leaning her boughs
To hear our laughter
And we roll in the ardor
Enchanted, I am, by you

Enchanted, I am, by you
