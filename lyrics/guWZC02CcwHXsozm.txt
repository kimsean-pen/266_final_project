What's happening to me?
I'm dying from the inside
Body hurts too much to feel.
And pressure adds to pain
Deliver us from evil
Straying out of sanity!

Why can't you let me be?
Is nothing else important?
Does my mind mean more to you?
'Cause if I carry on
Deliver us from evil
Screaming for your vanity!

Will darkness turn to light?
(Will darkness turn to light!)
Can someone wake me from this nightmare?
Here we go!
Here we go!

The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering!
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning!

The tank is empty, let it dry.

So now I hope you see
I'm nothing more than human
Making plans for enemies!
But here we go again
Deliver us from evil
Crawling back to insanity!

Will darkness turn to light?
(Will darkness turn to light!)
Can someone wake me from this nightmare?
Here we go!
Here we go!

The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering!
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning!
The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering!
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning!
The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering.

(Breakdown)
What's happening to me?
I'm dying from the inside
Body hurts too much to feel.
And pressure adds to pain
Deliver us from evil
Through evil...

Pressure adds to pain
You're evil! We're evil! I'm evil!

Will darkness turn to light?
(Will darkness turn to light!)
Can someone wake me from this nightmare?
Here we go!
Here we go!

The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering...
The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering.
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning!
The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering.
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning!

The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering. (I'm suffering!)
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning.
(Turning, turning, turning, turning!)
The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering. (I'm suffering!)
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning.
(Turning, turning, turning, I'm turning!)
The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering. (I'm suffering!)
(Turning, turning, turning, I'm turning!)
I'm suffering.
(Turning, turning, turning, I'm turning!)
I'm suffering.
(Turning, turning, turning, I'm turning!)
