I don't know the reason
Let's just make a choice
Lets throw out the caution
Just wanna hear your voice

So walk me through
Back through the fields
When I walked down
That road i find
I already know
On with the show
If there's a god
Then god only knows
Walk me back through
Fields I knew

So when
Like when we believed
A moment in time
When we shined
So walk me through

Back through the fields
Oh take me home
Back to the fields
Erase the dream
Rewrite the scene
If there's a god
Then god only knows
What we should know
On with the show

Ohh, ooaahh
ooaahh, oaah
oaaaooahh, oaaooaahhoahh
ooaahah, oooahh
oaaah, oaaah
oaahahhaa, oaaahhhh
oaaaaahh, oaaahh
oaaahhahhahh
