I wanna see you in the morning
I wanna see you when the breaking day is dawning
You gotta go you gotta go
It's alright

But I wanna see you in the see you in the light of the morning
And when I get the same reaction
I know this time it's gonna give some satisfaction
You gotta go you gotta go
It's alright

But I wanna see you in the see you in the light of the morning

I wanna see you in the morning
I wanna see you when the breaking day is dawning
You gotta go you gotta go
It's alright

But I wanna see you in the see you in the light of the morning
