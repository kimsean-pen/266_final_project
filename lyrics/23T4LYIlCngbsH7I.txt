Try to scrape it off the thought of skin against skin
Move it from the front to back and start it go again

But the depression and time breed and multiply
And I've got more mouths to feed
Than i could ever fit in this auto
You go have a good time
Bring back stories 'cause I will stay behind

So punch the clock two months are up and I am stuck down
Against the floor the heat rises out and leaves town

As the depression and time breed and multiply
'Til I've got more mouths to feed than
Than i could ever fit in this auto
You go have a good time
Bring back stories 'cause I will stay behind

And that's the story of the boy who tried to play it cool
Who found it hard to keep it up when you were changing rules

And the depression and time breed and multiply
'Til I've got more mouths to feed than
Than i could ever fit in this auto
You go have a good time
Bring back stories 'cause I will stay behind
