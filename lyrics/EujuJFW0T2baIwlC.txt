Rolling by, weary, uneven planes
A darkness lurks
Slowly, I am given to the mystery
I am drawn into its depths

A wall of, formidable strength
The power is palpable

As I hold on to your hand
Our bodies shaking in the cold, hard rain, "Help us!"
Will someone send us a raft?
Better we're eaten than left to starve

Floating by, the need for human touch
I'm all alone
Sadly, I think I am on my own
I am the only one left

These angry waves... are crushing me
Oh my god, it's hard to breathe
The poison swells in my flaccid body
Maybe I should swim back to what I know

Are lead pills easier to swallow than white powdery waste?
Should I hand you my head, or pull out my own tongue

The scales of deep constrict my body's weakness
I look to the sky and it cries for me

Once I held on to your hand
Now I'm fighting to stay alive, helpless
What will happen to the race of man?
Better to be lost than remembered wronged

Born for slaughter, raising child soldiers for pain
Giving our daughters, and all our hopes for your gain
Not even a wet escape, so take me, away
