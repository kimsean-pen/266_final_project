Mario
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Uh

Look at the time it took just to get to the top
Look at the run I had just to get to the spot
Look at the form I had just to hit me a shot
Look at the grind I had just to get me a lot
Look what I got

Look what I got
Look what I got, look what I got
Look what I got
Look what I got, look what I got
Look what I got
Look what I got, look what I got
Look what I got
Look what I got, look what I got

Look at the time I spent tryna whip up the foreign
Check on the stats, boy I'm scoring
Swapping these hoes out
Hit with no doubt but the pussy was boring
Back to the slab
Wrist was hurting, counting too much money that I barely could dab
Chemist in the lab, stirring the glass
Fuck the Uber app, I call her a cab
Yellow the swag
All the wins I got, I throw in the bag
Dig a hole, buried deep in the ground
Water it once in a while, watch it grow into cash
All you got is L's off in your stash
Picture perfect with it, watch for the flag
Getting to the money, marathon running
High hurdle jumping, hundred yard dash

Look at the time it took just to get to the top
(Tick tick tock)
Look at the run I had just to get to the spot
(Hustle hustle hustle)
Look at the form I had just to hit me a shot
(Swish swish swish)
Look at the grind I had just to get me a lot
Look what I got

Look what I got
(Whoa)
Look what I got, look what I got
(Whoa, whoa)
Look what I got
(Whoa)
Look what I got, look what I got
(Whoa, whoa)
Look what I got
(Whoa)
Look what I got, look what I got
(Whoa, whoa)
Look what I got (Uh)
Look what I got, look what I got

Look at the time it took just to get to the top
Hire out the condo and buy off the lot
Fuck off in Vegas, catch me at the table, like: Who want a knot?
Stiff arm the haters, Heisman the pose
Signal my nigga like I need a block
Touchdown, plenty time on the clock
Field goal ho, extra point for the top, good
Flood the diamonds in the wood, hood
Like the shooting guard for Cavs, splash
Early Tuesday morning, niggas still yawning
Only time I deal with trash
Bag, only emoji worth texting
Fuck the smiley face, missing
One hundred, strong-arm
Checkmate, multi flex-flexin'

Look at the time it took just to get to the top
(Tick tick tock)
Look at the run I had just to get to the spot
(Hustle hustle hustle)
Look at the form I had just to hit me a shot
(Swish swish swish)
Look at the grind I had just to get me a lot
Look what I got

Look what I got
(Whoa)
Look what I got, look what I got
(Whoa, whoa)
Look what I got
(Whoa)
Look what I got, look what I got
(Whoa, whoa)
Look what I got
(Whoa)
Look what I got, look what I got
(Whoa, whoa)
Look what I got (Uh)
Look what I got, look what I got

Look what I got
Look what I got, look what I got
Look what I got
Look what I got, look what I got
Look what I got
Whoa
Whoa
