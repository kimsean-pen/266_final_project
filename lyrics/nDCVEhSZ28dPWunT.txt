I can't deny what I've become
I'm just emotionally undone
I can't deny, I can't be someone else

when I have tried to find the words
To describe this sense absurd
Try to resist my thoughts
But I can't lie

I've been losing myself
My desire I can't have
No reason am I for

I can't divide or hide from me
I don't know who I'm meant to be
I guess it's just the person that I am

Often I've dreamt that I don't wait
Enjoy the gift of my mistake
and yet again I'm wrong and I confess

I've been losing myself
My desire I can't have
No reason am I for
