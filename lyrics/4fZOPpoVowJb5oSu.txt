Well, we were just another band out of Boston
On the road and tryin' to make ends meet
Playin' all the bars, sleepin' in our cars
And we practiced right on out in the street
No, we didn't have much money
We barely made enough to survive
But when we got up on stage and got ready to play people came alive

Rock and roll band everybody's waitin'
Getting' crazy, anticipatin'
Love, and music, play, play, play, yea, yea, yea, yea

Dancin' in the streets of Hyannis
We were getting pretty good at the game
People stood in line and didn't seem to mind
You know everybody knew our name
Livin' on rock and roll music
Never worried 'bout things we were missin'
When we got up on stage and got ready to play everybody'd listen

Rock and roll band everybody's waitin'
Getting' crazy, anticipatin'
Love, and music, play, play, play, yea, yea, yea, yea

Playin' for week in Rhode Island
A man came to the stage one night
He smoked a big cigar,
Drove a Cadillac car and said,
\"Boys, I think this band's outtasight;
Sign a record company contract!
You know I've got great expectations!
When I hear you on the car radio
You're gonna be a sensation!\"

Rock and roll band everybody's waitin'
Getting' crazy, anticipatin'
Love, and music, play, play, play, yea, yea, yea, yea
