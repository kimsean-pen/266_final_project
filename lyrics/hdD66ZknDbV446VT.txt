Now in comes the musical thing
From the King's offspring...
Jesse Royal

Some people you'll rate and them still choose to show you hate
Run them out of you yard
From them a play bad card

Them a backbiters
Hypocritical two-side lass
We call them modern day Judas
Spreaders of rumors

Them a backbiters

So why should I be afraid of you
When you bleed just like I do
The more you try fight
Jah Jah light keep shining through
So I've got no time for you
Cause in my view you wanna step in mi shoe
You wish you never live a luu and feel so damn confused
Oh every day you wake, a ache
Because you know you fake
And every step you take a bring you closer to your grave
But I'am like a column we no easily shake
Mi certain say fi mi no a unnu can't take
We guided by the Master
Defender of the Fate
Ordained to be Great

Them a backbiters
Hypocritical two-side lass
We call them modern day Judas
Spreaders of rumors

Both you teeth and tongue gonna let you down
Reward for your words shall be profound
Oh screw all you want
But go low and drown
Mi slew you like Goliath with a stone from mi crown
Not even the dog that pisseth on the wall of Babylon
Shall escape in this time
So words to the wise choose the right side
And don't be hindered by you foolish pride
I say no weapon formed against I-n-I shall prospa (prospa)
So tell Mr. Force ripe and mawga dog
Disrespect and face disaster

Hypocritical two-side lass
We call them modern day Judas

But I man denied concoctions you brew
You can gi mi spliff eh mi neva see a sluu
You can't gi mi stew not even cashews
Some a say mi paro
Some a say a narrow views
But I can't forget what Adolf did the jews
And what his friends did to the Tuff Gong too
All in the name of suppressing the truth
But I absolute
Mi them can't polute

Them a backbiters
