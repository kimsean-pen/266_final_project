Come on, now you're killing me
Come on, how you leaving?
You gotta live where the sound was born
The sound that never sleeps
Where it'll shine, please stay with me
Ride the tracks of the train out of New York City
Won't you? Won't you? Won't you?

(Listen to my noise)

This is where I live
Where the rich play dead
They don't wanna be found, watch you from the crow's nest
Draw a line between the need more and homeless
So we make our own fun, doing the lockjaw laugh
It's not the promised land, it's where I come from
So I tell myself not to ever forget

This is where I live
I'd never trade you for the west

Come on, now you're killing me
Come on, how you leaving?
You gotta live where the sound was born
The sound that never sleeps
Where it'll shine, please stay with me
Ride the tracks of the train out of New York City
Won't you? Won't you? Won't you?
