[Emma]
I was feeling done-in
Couldn't win
I'd only ever kissed before

[Brittany]: "You mean she?"
[Santana]: "Uh-huh..."

[Emma]
I thought there's no use getting
Into heavy sweating
It only leads to trouble and bad fretting
Now all I want to know
Is how to go
I've tasted blood and I want more

[Brittany & Santana]
More, more, more!

[Emma]
I'll put up no resistance
I want to stay the distance
I've got an itch to scratch
I need assistance
Touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me
I wanna be dirty
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night

Then if anything shows
While you pose
I'll oil you up and drop you down

[Brittany & Santana]
Down, down, down!

[Emma]
And that's just one small fraction
Of the main attraction ([Santana]: Oh!)
I want a friendly man ([Brittany]: Oh!)
And I need action

Touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me
I wanna be dirty
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night

[Santana]
Touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me
I wanna be dirty
[Britany]
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
[Santana]
Creature of the night

[Emma]
Oh, touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me!
Oh, I wanna be dirty
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night

[Will:] Creature of the night
[Kurt:] Creature of the night
[Carl:] Creature of the night
[Finn:] Creature of the night?
[Santana:] Creature of the night
[Brittany:] Creature of the night
[Will:] Creature of the night!
[Emma:] Creature of the night, woo!
