Baby, you drive me so crazy
Baby, you drive me so crazy

Baby you drive me so mad
You got me running round the town

Like a woman on a warpath

You put a spell on me
It's so good, can't you see?

But you got the magic to set me free

Baby, you drive me so crazy
Baby, you drive me so crazy

Baby you drive me so mad
You got me running round the town

Like a woman on a warpath

You use your magic touch
Blood runs faster, you make it boy
Then you're gone forever and it hurts so much
Baby, you drive me so crazy
Baby, you drive me so crazy
Baby you drive me so mad
You got me running round the town
Like a woman on a warpath

There was a time when you were high over me
But then the dark would stroke
And now you sail the sea

Baby, you drive me so crazy
Baby, you drive me so crazy
Baby you drive me so mad
You got me running round the town
Like a woman on a warpath

Baby, you drive me so crazy
Baby, you drive me so crazy
Baby you drive me so mad
You got me running round the town
Like a woman on a warpath
Baby you drive me so mad
You got me running round the town
Like a woman on a warpath
