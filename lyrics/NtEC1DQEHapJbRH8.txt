I've got to find a place to hideaway
Far from the shadows of my mind
Sunlight and laughter, love ever after
For how i long to find a place to hideaway
I hear you whisper and i must obey,
Blindly follow where you'll be
Knowing tomorrow brings only sorrow
Where can i go to find a place to hideaway
Bright colored pinwheels go round in my head
I run through the mist of the wine
(*) the night and the music remind me instead
The world once was mine
I'll save my pennies for a rainy day
But where can i buy another you?
Dreams are for sleeping
Love is for weeping
Oh, how i long to find a place to hideaway
Repeat (*)
