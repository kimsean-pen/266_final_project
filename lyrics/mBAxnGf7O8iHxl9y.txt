Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh-ahh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh-ahh
Turn up!

I got all of these bad thoughts in my head
Spent too many cold nights in my bed
Feelin' so lonely
I hate feelin' lonely

(Turn up!)

Gon' give you that good love you deserve (ooh-ooh)
Gon' give you that "ah" touch, till it hurts
Just want you on me
Hey, say that you want me

(Heh!)
(Turn up!)

Gotta pocket full of gold
What's your vice?
Anywhere you wanna go?
Well, just ask nice
You caught me on a good day
Oh, tell me what you like
I'll get it right
I'll get it right

I'm a taker, not a giver, but I'm into to you
And the way you lookin' at me got me in the mood
I'm feelin' generous
(Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha)
I'm feelin' generous
(Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha)

So, let's have the type of night you never had before
Give you all of my attention, then I'll give you more
I'm feelin' generous
(Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha)
I'm feelin' generous
(Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha)

(Turn up!)

You don't gotta feel guilty, just lose control
Kinda makin' me dizzy
(You know it's not your fault)
You make me want you
You know I look good on you
(I look good on you, on you, Babe)
(Turn up!)

Gotta pocket full of gold
What's your vice?
(What's your vice?)
Anywhere you wanna go
Well, just ask nice
(Just ask nice)
You caught me on a good day
Oh, tell me what you like
I'll get it right
I'll, get, it, right

I'm a taker, not a giver, but I'm into to you
And the way you lookin' at me got me in the mood
I'm feelin' generous
(Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha)
I'm feelin' generous
(Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha)

So, let's have the type of night you never had before
Give you all of my attention, then I'll give you more
I'm feelin' generous
(Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha)
I'm feelin' generous
(Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha)
(Turn up!)

(Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha)
I'm feelin' generous
(Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha)

Gonna give you that "uhm"
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh-ahh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh-ahh)
