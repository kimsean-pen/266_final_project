You're like a junk email in my inbox
Keep coming back, keep coming back
Like a constant ringing in my ears, oh
Keep calling back,
Why are you calling back again?

Like a train that's running out of steam, oh
You're losing track,
Should've stopped way back
You're with a new girl now, she's only 16
Hanging off a string,
I heard her heart smash

So tell your girlfriend
That you used to be my boyfriend
Used to be my boyfriend,
How would she like that?
She doesn't know about
All the things you've done then
All the things you've said
Just to try and get me back
But you had your chance

Peroxide on your heart
It's burning,
It's falling apart
Peroxide on my heart
It's turning light from the dye

Peroxide in your eyes
It's burning,
Burning your heart
Peroxide, you ask why
You ask why it all fell apart

She's one beautiful rose in a thorn field
She doesn't know that you're among those
She can only give so much until you take
Take yourself back
And leave the pain

So tell your girlfriend
That you used to be my boyfriend
Used to be my boyfriend,
How would she like that?
She doesn't know about
All the things you've done then
All the things you've said
Just to try and get me back
But you had your chance

Peroxide on your heart
It's burning,
It's falling apart
Peroxide on my heart
It's turning light from the dye

Peroxide in your eyes
It's burning,
Burning your heart
Peroxide, you ask why
You ask why it all fell apart

Let it burn
'Cause it's your turn
To feel something now

Peroxide on your heart
It's burning,
It's falling apart
Peroxide on my heart
It's turning light from the dye

Peroxide in your eyes
It's burning,
Burning your heart
Peroxide, you ask why
You ask why it all fell apart
