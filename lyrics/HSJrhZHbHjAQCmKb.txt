Rise with me now
And we'll walk to the shore
We'll look over the waves
To the break of day

I'll hold your hand
I'll hold you close
I'll wipe away your tears
And no one will know

On the morning tide
We'll hoist the sails to brave the crashing waves
Want you come with me
And hear the ocean sigh
And if to its deaths it called us by our names
Want you sail to the shore with me

Come to me now
And together we'll go
Where the clearer winds blow
Far and beyond
Leaving behind
All our sorrow and pride
Kissing 'em goodbye
Into another life

On the morning tide
We'll hoist the sails to break the crashing waves
Want you come with me
And hear the ocean sigh
And if to its deaths it called us by our names
Want you sail to the shore with me

Want you go with me
Sail to the shore with me
Want you go with me
Go with me

Love is still here
Never will it leave
You're always with me
And I'm always with you

On the morning tide
We'll hoist the sails to break the crashing waves
Want you come with me
And hear the ocean sigh
And if to its deaths it called us by our names
Want you sail to the shore with me

We'll hoist the sails to break the crashing waves
Want you sail to the shore with me
