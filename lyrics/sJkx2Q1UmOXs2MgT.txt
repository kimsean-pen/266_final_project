So many people i do not want to see
So many people don't want them standing next to
Me and my mind are crawling down the street
Severed my feet i severed
Seventy seven sevens in a line
Number of nothing something of a lie
Lie to myself when i start to feel heat
Right through my tooth while i'm literally
Grinding my teeth to the map of the beat
Flatten and flush when a quantized rush
I am the beast of the burden you seek

Trash generator
I'm not a bad guy

Feeling the grind of the infinite repeat
Switch it around so the loop's in between
What you can see and what everyone thinks
When you can feedback everything's neat
Is it dark enough
Am i dumb enough
Where's the darker stuff
