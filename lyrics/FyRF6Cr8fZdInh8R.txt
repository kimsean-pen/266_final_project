What's your problem?
Can't you see it?
And you go and blow it
Like everyone knows you will

Don't leave this rock unturned
'Cause you could like what you find
A sure shot hit
With your name attached to it
Will you keep me in mind?
I won't cast the first stone
Or leave the first mark
But I will leave a lasting impression
You believe what you want
And you said what's been said
And I do hope you learn a lesson
Ohh, do hope you learn a lesson

What's your problem?
Can't you see it?
And you go and blow it
Like everyone knows you will

Don't look too hard for what you want
'Cause it could be on the tip of your tounge
You're holding back
Like there's nothing left to it
Could this be a false alarm?
I won't cast the first stone
Or leave the first mark
But I will leave a lasting impression
You believe what you want
And you said what's been said
And I do hope you learn a lesson
Ohh, do hope you learn a lesson

What's your problem?
Can't you see it?
And you go and blow it
Like everyone knows you will

Why don't you get it together now
Failure's not flattering
When will you show yourself?
When will you show yourself?
Ohh, do hope you learn a lesson
Ohhhh, you'll never learn your lesson

What's your problem?
Can't you see it?
And you go and blow it
Like everyone knows you will

What's your problem?
Can't you see it?
And you go and blow it
Like everyone knows you will
