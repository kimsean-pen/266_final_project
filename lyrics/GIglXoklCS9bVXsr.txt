Millions of songs, all those years in my soul
And when we met, I just knew they're for you
Now your voice is singing them all
Your wings at mine, we will never fall

On and on, we will fly now âˆ§ forever
Side to side, now and forever, my love

Thousands of miles through the cold stormy air
There's really nothing that I wouldn't dare
I climb the eye of the hurricane
When the winds are whispering your name

On and on, we will fly now and forever
Side to side, now and forever, my love

Now and forever, now and forever
(Now and forever)
Fly, fly, now and forever
(Now and forever)
Now and forever

We will fly now and forever
Side to side, now and forever
Fly with you, now and forever
Me and you, now and forever
Now
