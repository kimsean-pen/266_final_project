Simple love
A flag in the ground
Taking this home
And making it ours
A life through windows
The highway sings goodnight
And selfishly I want it to be

Now and forever
Now and forever
Now and forever
Again

Steal me away
I will waste all your time
I never which are mine
This love is all yours

Now and forever
Now and forever
Now and forever
Again

Simplicity, the only thing that I need
No much wasting my legs
Or chasing my tail
Click the circus life
And take off my shoes
Must have paid what I owed
To be noticed by you

Now and forever
Now and forever
Now and forever
Again

Now and forever
Now and forever
Now and forever
Again
