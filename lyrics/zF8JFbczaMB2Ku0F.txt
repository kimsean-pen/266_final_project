I saw your tear fall from your grace
I fell in love
I saw that fear when you showed me that kiss
We fell in love
I'll play this song for you
I'll play this song for you
Ooh, I make mistakes
Mm I know things break
Hear me love you
Let me love you
Ooh, I'll lay you down
I feel you now
All my lives I've seen
I'm thankful for this
'Cause you're my favorite place to bleed
Bleed for me
All these ways I've been
Ooh, I'm thankful for them
Mm, you bleed for me
Bleed for me
Why don't you tell me what you need?
Oh, what you need
Oh, what you need
I feel your heart pain
I feel your pain
I feel your heart baby
I feel your pain (ooh)
I feel your heart baby
I feel your pain
I feel your heart baby
I feel your pain (ooh)
I feel your heart baby
I feel your pain
(Why don't you tell me what you need?)
I feel your heart baby
I feel your pain
I feel your heart baby
I feel your pain
I feel your heart baby
I feel your pain
