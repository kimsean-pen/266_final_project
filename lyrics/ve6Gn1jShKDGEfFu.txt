I was a boy from the hills
I ran so much before she came
Then I saw you, we grew together
You were just the same

We fell in love, oh so desperately
Against your family's will
Planned to run away
She said to meet me at night on the hill

They'll never find us is what she said
We could have made it out but
In the night they sold her life

Now there's nothing more than this
A lonely sky amongst the mist
Now you're gone
My black swan

I know there's nothing left to say
But if you ever fly my way
Sing your song
Now you're gone
Love so strong
My black swan

I may have said the case was a mystery
The joy has set them free
Now the town sails my history
To a place no one should be

You did the crime that's what they say
I wish I could clear my name from
That dark night they stole our light

Now there's nothing more than this
A lonely sky amongst the mist
Now you're gone
My black swan

I know there's nothing left to say
But if you ever fly my way
Sing your song
Now you're gone
Love so strong
My black swan

They'll never find us is what she said
We could have made it out but
In the night they sold her life

You did the crime that's what they say
I wish I could clear my name from
That dark night they stole our light

Now there's nothing more than this
A lonely sky amongst the mist
Now you're gone
My black swan
I know there's nothing left to say
But if you ever fly my way
Sing your song
Now you're gone
love so strong
My black swan
My black swan
My black swan
