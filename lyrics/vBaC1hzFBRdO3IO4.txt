On the bridge out of Hammond
See them brake lights burning feel my motor turnin
On the bridge out of Hammond
See the big city moon
See how it close comes (x2)
Watch my wiper blades pound it like a drum
On the bridge out of Hammond (x2)
Think about what's darkening my life (x2)
See the light of the afterworld shining on the ruins
It's the light of nowhere else burning to the west
See its sulphery shine (x2)
From the bridge out of Hammond (x2)
See the big city moon (x3)
Between the radio towers
Between the big diesel rigs
In the Midwest's witching hour
I watch the whole town eclipse
From the bridge out of Hammond (x4)
