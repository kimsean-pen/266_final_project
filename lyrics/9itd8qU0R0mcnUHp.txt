There's a hole in my head
There's a hole in my heart
There's a hole in the wall
That wasn't there in the start
There's a hole in the feeling
Fucking hole in the ceiling
But they still don't believe it
No they never could see it

There's a tear in the seam
There's a bend in the pane
There's a glitch in the stream
But we just fell there between
There's a fault in the system
So much talk but no listen
So much empathy missing

And it feels like everything is falling apart
Oh it feels like everything is falling apart

Got your head in the sand
Got your soul on a stand
Say you're so educated
With your elaborate plans
You don't care to correct it
Keep yourself unaffected
Who are you really protecting?

And it feels like everything is falling apart
Oh it feels like everything is falling apart

Way I wanna feel like
Way I wanna feel like with one
Don't wanna feel like
Don't wanna feel like it's done
Way I wanna feel like
(Way I wanna feel like)
Way I wanna feel like with one
(With one)
Don't wanna feel like
(Don't wanna feel like)
Don't wanna feel like it's done

And it feels like everything is falling apart
Oh it feels like everything is falling apart

Oh it feels like everything is falling apart
