Marching in the mist, leaving behind the weak's
Going this endless war like a tormenting nightmare
Over the devastated ruins, a sign
Sign of hate for a masses despair

To revenge the years arrested in abyss
(Where) Jesus Christ made his suffer
The final command is happening here now
Which I see is the warriors marching to death
