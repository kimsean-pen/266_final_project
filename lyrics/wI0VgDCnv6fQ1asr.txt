So it's a bust
But we don't wanna bail so stick with us
Cause even if we fail, you can trust
That we'll know for sure that our intentions
Are never anything but pure

We only want to be free
And as funny as it sounds it's all we want
To not have our egos bound with the rays of suns
Cause man should be free as falling rain
To find what he loves even if it's pain

We keep bringing
The same dream to bed every night
To keep our spirits fed to keep from being
Just another talking head that makes the world think
That there's something wrong with man

We only want to be free
And as funny as it sounds it's all we want
To not have our egos bound with the rays of suns
Cause man should be free as falling rain
To find what he loves even if it's pain

We only want to be free
And as funny as it sounds it's all we want
To not have our egos bound with the rays of suns
Cause man should be free as falling rain
To find what he loves even if it's pain
