Well, goodbye God, going to Bodie am I
Going to Bodie, looking for a good time
Goodbye good people, you can't help me anymore
I'm going down for sure

I'm a shoe
And so are you

Well, goodbye God, going to Bodie am I
Going to Bodie, looking for a good time
I'd follow you until the end of this Earth
But Bodie comes first

I'm a shoe
And so are you

Well, goodbye God, going to Bodie am I
Going to Bodie, looking for a good time
Lower down than the roots of a pine tree
Don't waste your prayers on me

I'm a shoe
And so are you
