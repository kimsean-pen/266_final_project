Make you up
Take you out
Play it up to bring you down
Take the time to make this last

Spin the wheel
Watch it crash
Turn the dress to broken glass
Strike a pose and hold the flash

I'm not the only one who's bleeding
Before the past is done repeating
Gets underneath my skin
It won't die

This time, if I can't win
Then I won't try to carry on
I'll play it satirical
Tonight won't be so long
I'll pray for a miracle

Wake you up
Pull you out
Talk you up to calm you down
Turn it up to scream and shout

Make you tired
Wear you out
Shut you up and turn you off
Clean you up and take you home

I'm not the only one who's bleeding
Before the past is done repeating
Gets underneath my skin
It won't die

This time, if I can't win
Then I won't try to carry on
I'll play it satirical
Tonight won't be so long
I'll pray for a miracle
