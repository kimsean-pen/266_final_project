I got a question for you
I got a question for You
Where did you get your name from
Where did you get your name from?

I got a question for you
Where do you see yourself
In five minutes time?

With a laugh like that
Or a look like that
You make us all feel gauche
Like it's a sweaty joke, but

With a laugh like that
Or a move like that
You make us all just go
La, la, la, la, woah

Woah, look out
You're what she came for
You're what she came for
No question, no doubt

Woah, look out
You're what she came for
Knows what she came for
No question, no doubt, woah

You're what she came for

I got a question for you
Another question for you
Oh, do you feel the
Oh, do you feel the pressure?

Why you're wearing
What you're wearing
Where will your life be gone
In five minutes time?

So say something stupid
You know that you'd love to

Woah, look out
You're what she came for
You're what she came for
No question, no doubt

Woah, look out
You're what she came for
Knows what she came for
No question, no doubt
Woah
You're what she came for, woah
You're what she came for, woah
You're what she came for, woah
You're what she came for
You're what she came for
You're what she came for
