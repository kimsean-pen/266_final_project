She keeps me up after late phone calls
Dreaming of her arms around me
Well, I think she's beautiful
She thinks I'm going blind

Well, I could spend my life tryin' to write these songs
And I could spend my time tryin' to right my wrongs
Oh, she's worth it, she says that I'm the one

And no one can love you like I can, honey
We gotta make this work 'cause when I get to runnin'
You get to thinkin' that one of us is gonna get hurt

We could walk around this town like we own the world
But everybody bows at your feet
Well, they think you're crazy, girl
Well, crazy for a guy like me

When I'm gone
You're the only one I want
When I'm here
You're the only one I need

'Cause no one can love you like I can, honey
We gotta make this work 'cause when I get to runnin'
You get to thinkin' that one of us is gonna get hurt

You're right, girl
Well, I don't know what's wrong with me
'Cause you need somebody
And I need some growing up
You're the one who's gonna get hurt

And no one can love you like I can, honey
We gotta make this work 'cause when I get to runnin'
You get to thinkin' that one of us is gonna get
(You're gonna get hurt)

You're right, girl
Well, I don't know what's wrong with me
You need somebody and I need some growing up
You're the one that said that I need somebody
And you need some growing up
So no one will ever get hurt
