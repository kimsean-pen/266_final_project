When others left before
I could bear to turn away
Now that it's come to this
Is there nothing left to say?
I've never known before
Such exquisite suffering
As I watched you walk away
I gave in to panicking

I can't believe that
This is really happening
Have I really lost again?
Desperation drives me insane
I will focus all the pain
Right into your heart

Till it makes you blind
Till the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight
Till you're mine
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I'm crucified

Cold and unwhole again
Crying out and questioning
Will I ever love again?
What's the point of anything?
It takes a toll again
This is where the "fun" begins
Visions haunt me through the night
Now I'm dying for your sins

I can't believe that
If you looked me in the face
You could say there's nothing left
How the silence drives me insane
I will focus all my pain
Right into your heart

Till it makes you blind
Till the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight
Till you're mine
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I'm crucified

I cannot feel anything; anger I've been harboring
You've nailed me to the cross; upon it, I will remain
I can't feel anything; rage inside is festering
You've nailed me to the cross; upon it, I will remain

I will focus all my pain
Right into your heart

Till it makes you blind
Till the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight
Till you're mine (mine)
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I'm crucified
Till it makes you blind (blind)
Till the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight (I'm crucified)
Till you're mine (mine)
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I'm crucified
