You know that it hurts me when you don't come home at night
My body can't rest unless you're sleeping by my side
You know that it hurts me when you stay away all night
What is it that keeps you there?
Keeping you occupied, from my heart
My heart
Somehow

You know that it hurts me when you don't come home at night
You'll see that it's better than beyond the ... side
You know that it hurts me when you can't see straight at night
Will keep you there, keeping you glorified, in my heart
My heart
My heart
Hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope
You know that it hurts me when
You know that it hurts me when
You don't, you don't, you don't

You know that it hurts me when you don't come home at night
My body can't rest unless you're sitting by my side
You know that it hurts me when you stay away all night
What is it that keeá¹—s you there?
Keeping you occupied from my heart
