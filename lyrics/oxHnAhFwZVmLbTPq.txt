Hello? (Hello)
How are you? (Yeah)
Can you talk for a minute? (Yes)
Ehm, I don't really know where to begin, but...
You know, I came home last night to talk to my husband
And I told him about us, and, ehm, talked for a long time
And, I guess long story short, we're gonna try to work things out
You and I can't talk anymore

They kills us off the guilty love

Guilty love (woah)

Guilty love (ooh)
They kills us off the guilty love
Woah, ooh, ooh, ooh, woah
