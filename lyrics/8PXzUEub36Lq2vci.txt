City lights shine on the harbor
Night has fallen down
Through the darkness and the shadow
I will still go on

Chorus:
Long Long Journey
Through the darkness
Long Long way to go
But what are miles across the ocean to the heart that's coming home?

Where the road runs through the valley
Where the river flows
I will follow every highway
To the place I know

Chorus:
Long Long Journey
Through the darkness
Long Long way to go
But what are miles across the ocean to the heart that's coming home?

Long Long Journey
I don't know where
Long Long way to go
But what are sighs and what is sadness to the heart that's coming home?

Chorus:
Long Long Journey
Through the darkness
Long Long way to go
But what are miles across the ocean to the heart that's coming home?

Long Long Journey
Out Of Nowhere
Long Long way to go
But what are sighs and what is sadness to the heart that's coming home?
