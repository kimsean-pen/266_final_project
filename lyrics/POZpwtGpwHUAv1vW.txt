From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
We'll be lovers once again
On the bright side of the road
Little darlin', come with me
Won't you help me share my load
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
And into this life we're born
Baby, sometimes, sometimes we don't know why
And time seems to go by so fast
In the twinkling of an eye
Let's enjoy it while we can
Won't you help me share my load
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
Again
And into this life we're born
Baby sometimes, baby sometimes we don't know why, don't know
Time seems to go by so fast
In the twinkling of an eye
Let's enjoy it while we can
And help me sing my song
Little darlin', come alone
On the bright side of the road
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
Little darlin', come alone
On the bright side of the road, come on dear
Alright
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
We'll be lovers once again
On the bright side of the road
Oh, we'll be, we'll be lovers once again
On the bright side of the road
We'll be lovers once again
On the bright side of the road
