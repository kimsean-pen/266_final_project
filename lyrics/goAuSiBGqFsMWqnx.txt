Alone in the dark
Hole in my heart
Turn on the radio
And the words fall out
But they got no place to go

Wasted on you
High on the fumes
Know I should let you go
But the world won't stop
And all I got is your ghost

Another day, another lonely night
I would do anything to have you by my side
Another day, another lonely night
Don't wanna to throw away another lonely life

No time to sleep
All that I see
Are old memories of you
Yeah, I try my best
But there's no one left for me to lose

Tear in my eye
I drive through the night
As far as I can from you
And I don't give a fuck If the sun comes up
Yeah, it's just another...

Another day, another lonely night
I would do anything to have you by my side
Another day another lonely night
(Just another lonely night)
Don't wanna to throw away another lonely life

(Night, night)

No, I don't give a fuck If the sun comes up
Yeah, it's just another...

Another day, another lonely night
I would do anything to have you by my side
Another day, another lonely night
(Just another lonely night)
Don't wanna to throw away another lonely life
