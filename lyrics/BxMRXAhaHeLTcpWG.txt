Let's throw a party
Dirty dishes and copious
Amounts of anxiety
Lurking toes under the sheets

The room is getting real uptight
Or are these kids just
High off adrenaline
Pacing 'round the balcony

Roaming 'round the streets
High off the summer sweet
I can see your silhouette still
Dancing 'round your feet

Lay here if you may
Stay here for the day
Doesn't matter if the earth caves
I'm sure we'll find a way
You know we'll always be okay

In the corner
Waiting for the mood to dim
'Cause the lights are blinding me
Artificial energies

I'm feeling so strung out
After all this time, I've realised
It was never meant to be
Let's stay home and watch TV

Roaming 'round the streets
High off the summer sweet
I can see your silhouette still
Dancing 'round your feet

Lay here if you may
Stay here for the day
Doesn't matter if the earth caves
I'm sure we'll find a way
You know we'll always be okay

Roaming 'round the streets
High off the summer sweet
I can see your silhouette still
Dancing 'round your feet

Lay here if you may
Stay here for the day
Doesn't matter if the earth caves
I'm sure we'll find a way
You know we'll always be okay
