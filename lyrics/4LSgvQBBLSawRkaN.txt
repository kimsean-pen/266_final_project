I lost a piece, a part of me
A way to release myself from hope
I lost a sense of peace and empathy
Beneath my bones
I lost a home of places and people around
The waves of speech and movements of our souls
I lost a piece, a part of me
In my own head
I lost a sense of peace and empathy
Through the ways I bled
I lost a home of places and people around the
Waves of speech and movements and things we know
I want a place I can call home
With you and me in a place we're free
But I notice all the things you say,
And the things you do, the words go away

So I feel so scared, and I don't know where to go
And I don't know where hide,
From the things inside of you and of me from what we be
I lost a piece, a part of me
A way to release myself from hope
I lost a sense of peace and empathy
Beneath my bones
I lost a home of places and people
Around the waves of speech and movements
I sense the grief,
The pain in the ways you explain the things you
Believe, you don't mean the words you say no more

You can not hide, you can't lie to me no more
