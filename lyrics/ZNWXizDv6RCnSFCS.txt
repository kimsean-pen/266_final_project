I don't know why you're here
Been trying to find it out
Why you're here
Been trying to find it out oh
Imma ask now
Take it off
Imma ask now
I wonder why you showed up
You don't think that I forgot
This time you stole my silver coat, hanging on your lips
Avoid my tricks to unwill your thoughts
I act like I forgot my purse at you house
Try me golddigger
You know me, fight me snake charmer
You know me, tricks don't work on me
You know me, tricks don't work on me
Try me golddigger
You don't think that I forgot
This time you stole my silver coat, hanging on your lips
Avoid my tricks to unwill your thoughts
I act like I forgot my purse at your house
Try me golddigger
You know me, fight me snake charmer
You know me, tricks don't work on me
You know me, tricks don't work on me
Try me golddigger
Fight me snake charmer
Try me golddigger
You know me
