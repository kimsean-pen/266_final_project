Turn on the lights I think I'm losing strength
I'll wait forever till it all make sense to me
The room is spinning while I'm standing still
I need a remedy to lift me up

Until it all falls back just like you said
My heart's not built for bitterness
I'm on the last train home, need to clear my head
And think aloud what's to dream

They said we could find safe haven
But I think it's wherever we are
You know I'll be patient despite our racing hearts

They said we could find safe haven
I know it won't tear us apart
You know I've got a lot to say
Don't you run away or stay in reverie, in reverie

Congratulations, I'm a wreck again
Messed around, feeling down, thought it was all pretend
I'm realizing I've got time to kill show
Give me a remedy to lift me up

Until it all falls back just like you said
My heart's not built for bitterness
I'm on the last train home, need to clear my head
And think aloud what's to dream

They said we could find safe haven
But I think it's wherever we are
You know I'll be patient despite our racing hearts

They said we could find safe haven
I know it won't tear us apart
You know I've got a lot to say
Don't you run away or stay in reverie, in reverie

Let's rewrite about our everything goes to hell from me
Out of spite
I'm taking one last chance to find my sanity

They said we could find safe haven
But I think it's wherever we are
You know I'll be patient despite our racing hearts

They said we could find safe haven
But I think it's wherever we are
You know I'll be patient despite our racing hearts

They said we could find safe haven
I know it won't tear us apart
You know I've got a lot to say
Don't you run away or stay in reverie, in reverie
