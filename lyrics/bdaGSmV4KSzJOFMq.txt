Ready mix, packet of Smash
Sex cults
6 packs lash
Drum edge
No tone, they're faceless
The mix on sticks
Ibiza's rotten encrusted rocks
Transmit, transmit (transmit)
What's he fuckin' doing?
What's he fuckin' doing?
Ha
What's he fuckin' doing?

Don't fall off the rocks

Plug it in, pre-mixed, all bought it
It's all about the gear
Bleached-hair wanking mates
Just flown in on the Lear
Private-jet, personal flyer
All Danny, all fucking Dyer
Straights eight quid a packet?
Fuck that
I'm on the baccy mate

What's he fuckin' doing?

'Cause the music, you're so darn dull
