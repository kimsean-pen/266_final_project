i whisper i love you
into your ear
i don't know
if you even hear
a word that i say
'cause you're lying there
i hope you're dreaming of me

we need to know that
you're not a () case
()
(feel nice to say back to me?)

you're sleeping
all of the time
you're sleeping
all of the time

when was the last time that
you saw a morning
when was the last time that i
saw your face
smiling awake like
it was in the old days
maybe you're dreaming of then

i wait around for you
watching the clock go around
and around and now the day is all gone
and i miss you

you're sleeping
all of the time
you're sleeping
all of the time

i love to go
under your pillow
i hope you find it soon
maybe you'll call me someday

do you remember when i used to wake you
each morning with kisses, you'd kiss me too
that was so long ago now i just slip away
quietly so as not to disturb you

i've only got so much time in the day to be with you
i'd love to be with you always but...
just nuts about you

you're sleeping
all of the time
you're sleeping
all of the time

you're sleeping
all of the time
you're sleeping
all of the time
