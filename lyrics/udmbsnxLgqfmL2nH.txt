And the earth spins round while the people fall down
And the world stands still not a sound not a sound
There is love there is love to be found

In the worst way
In the worst way
In the worst way

It's the buzz
It's the buzz
It's the buzz

It's the buzz
It's the buzz
I wish I was

It's the buzz
It's the buzz
With the most fun

From a little shell at the bottom of the sea
With the earth and the moon and the sun above me

Well the world fell down with the people still around

There is love
There is love to be found

While the gods are gone and the souls making sounds

In the worst way
In the worst way
In the worst way

It's the buzz
It's the buzz
It's the buzz

It's the buzz
It's the buzz
I wish I was

It's the buzz
It's the buzz
With the most fun

From a little shell at the bottom of the sea
With the earth and the moon and the sun around me

There is love
There is love
There is love

It's a buzz
It's a buzz
It's a buzz

It's the buzz
It's the buzz
I wish I was

It's the buzz
It's the buzz
It's the buzz
