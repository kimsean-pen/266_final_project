This time I'm taking it away, I've got a problem
With me getting in the way, not by design
So I take my face and bash it into a mirror
I won't have to see the pain, bleed, bleed

This state is elevating as the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked-up feelings again

The hurt inside is fading
This shit's gone way too far
All this time I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking
I'm done, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and oh, I cannot give anymore

My mind's done with this, okay, I've got a question
Can I throw it all away?
Take back what's mine
So I take my time
Guiding the blade down the line
Each cut closer to the vein, bleed, bleed

This state is elevating as the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked-up feelings again

The hurt inside is fading
This shit's gone way too far
All this time I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking
I'm done, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and oh, I cannot give anymore

I'm here to stay, bring it down
I'm here to stay, bring it down
I'm here to stay, bring it down
I'm here to stay, bring it down
Bring it down
Bring it down
Bring it down
Gonna break it down
Gonna break it down
Gonna break it down
Gonna break it down
Gonna break it down
Gonna break it down
Gonna break it down, gonna break it

This state is elevating as the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked-up feelings again

The hurt inside is fading
This shit's gone way too far
All this time I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking
I'm done, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and oh, I cannot give anymore
Give anymore
Give anymore
Give anymore
Give anymore
