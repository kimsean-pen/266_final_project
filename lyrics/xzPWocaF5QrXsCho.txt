I used to see the night so anxious
But now I know
The only thing it ever taught me was a grand illusion
That comes and goes
The city blanketed in snow

What if we die, no end and no conclusion?
How could you smile, just walk away?
Well, I don't know
I don't know

I met you at the railroad station
Now years ago
And something happened on the night I last drank with you
In the neon glow
Now I don't see you anymore

The Midwestern sky is gray and cold
The sun never shines but that's alright
And I couldn't find the letters that you wrote me
What did you write, where'd you go?
Well, I don't know

Take a little time, gonna roll the dice
Taken for a ride, any normal life will do too
Find another way, try to break the ice
Every day and night the banana peels were true, true
