Oh hey, I wasn't listening
I was watching Syria
Blinded by the sunshine strip
You, you were in the kitchen
Oh your mariner's mouth the wounded with the wounder's whip

And that's how summer passed
Oh The Great Dividing Range
The green, green grass and oh
Maybe it was peace at last, who knew

Hello love, my invincible friend
Oh hello love, the thistle and the burr
Oh hello love, for you I have so many words
But I, I forget where we were

Oh hey, I wasn't listening
I was stung by all of us
The blind leading out the bored
And as per usual, you were
Skipping and laughing eyes at the bedroom door
Don't take it so seriously, no
Only time is ours, the rest we'll just wait and see
Maybe you're right babe, maybe

And that's how summer passed
Oh The Great Dividing Range
The green, green grass and oh
Maybe I'll hold on fast to you

Hello love, my invincible friend
Oh hello love, the thistle and the burr
Oh hello love, for you I have so many words
But I, I forget where we were

I, I forget where we were
I, I forget where we were
I forget where we were, no
I forget where we were, no

And that's how summer passed
Oh The Great Dividing Range
The green, green grass and oh
Maybe it was peace at last, who knew
