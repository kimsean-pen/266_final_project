I've spent so much time above the earth
Thinking about life and each man's worth
How could one person be worth more than
A thousand people knoking on his door

Still the motion of your hair
Well that could take me anywhere
Because you're happier than I
Please don't say goodbye

Then I get of the plane
A thousand thoughts reaching through my brain
Like am I really here at all

Will I see her again
If I do will it feel the same
And am I really here at all
