I am what I create
Believing in my fate
Integrity is my name
All that I am doing
Can never be ruined
My song remains insane

Eye for an eye
Eye for an eye
Eye for an eye
Eye for an eye, for an eye, for an eye

Fuck

Get to watch my back
Get let my heart
Believe on day I'll fly
To reunite the tribe
To find a better way
Fucking envy changes everything

Eye for an eye
Eye for an eye
Eye for an eye
Eye for an eye, for an eye, for an eye

That's right

I hit the bottom
You don't understand
Pain, hate, pain
To born again
Arise again
I believe is the only way

Eye for an eye
Eye for an eye
Eye for an eye
Eye for an eye, for an eye, for an eye

Eye for an eye, eye for an eye
Eye for an eye, eye for an eye
