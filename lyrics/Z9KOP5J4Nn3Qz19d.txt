Lying awake in the dead of night
Listening to my heart beat away
Wishing I wasn't alone here tonight
But wishing just gets in the way

I just want, I just want a litle fire (2x)

The night's so cold when you're all alone
At least it's always been cold to me
And the clock ticks away, ticks away, ticks away
And the clock settles in around me

I just want, I just want a litle fire (2x)
Fire

You might be wondering just how it feels
Well I hope you never know
'Cause I know exactly how it feels
It's all I ever know

I just want, I just want a litle fire (4x)
Fire, fire
