Striking over oceans of blood
Over kingdoms in fears
Where the night bred its cold
dark the winter drew near

[Chorus:]
Watch the sky, the crimson tears of heaven
The darkened mist of burning hate

Ashes of the past, Years that fell into oblivion
Visions so dim they had, memories of a time
yet to come

[Chorus:]
Watch the sky, the crimson tears of heaven
As damnation reaches the hidden land

Through the forest of profanity
The sound of cries
Brought forth by the night sky

Invoked by their own tongues, Yes theyre truly
awake now
The souls that were sleeping, under the tree of death

And i laugh as i burn down the pearly gates of light
And forever Ill be within the arms of abomination

Embracement of eternal dark
With the ancient souls at the sides
Wasteland bathed in evil...
are one with the blackened sky

[Chorus:]
Watch the sky, the crimson tears of heaven
fade to black and welcome the night of all nights
