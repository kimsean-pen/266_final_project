- Lyrics and music by David Bowie

Tragic youth was looking young and sexy
The tragic youth was wearing tattered black jeans
Bearing arms and flooring all her mischief
The tragic youth was growing down on me
And I swear
Hoo, hoo
Yes, I swear

I feel the wall of silence separate us
I hear the morning junk, her wretched highs
I spin from Planet X to Planet Alpha
Struggling for reality

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Woo, hoo
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Woo hoo

Hey, now my sight is failing in this twilight
Duh duh duh duh duh-duh duh-duh-duh
Now my death is more than just a sad song
Da duh duh duh duh-duh duh-duh-duh

And I swear
Hoo, hoo
Yes, I swear
Hoo, hoo

I still don't remember how this happened
I still don't get the 'wherefores' and the 'whys'
I look for sense but I get next to nothing
Hey, boy, welcome to reality

Ha, ha, ha, ha
Woo, hoo

I've been right and I've been wrong
Now I'm back where I started from
Never looked over reality's shoulder

Ha, ha, ha, ha
Huh, ha, ha, ha
Woo, hoo

Huh, ha, ha
Woo, hoo
Wooh
