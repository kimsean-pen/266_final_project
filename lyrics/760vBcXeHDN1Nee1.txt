I'm too young to remember
I wanna get, wanna get what I want, hey
I'm too young to remember
I wanna get, wanna get what I want, hey

Rewind and let's go back tonight, back to 1991
Batman and Super Mario, nevermind playing all night long
Mm-mm, you're unbelievable
But you justify my love
Berlin is dancing on the wall
As the sun comes up, hey

Time has gone and my love is trouble
Get me more, yeah, you're now my trouble
Ay-ay-ay, no way-ay-ay
I gotta be the situation, but I find a way to fire
Never giving up, I'm taking it higher
Ay-ay-ay, no way-ay-ay

I'm too young to remember
I wanna get, wanna get what I want, hey
I'm too young to remember
I wanna get, wanna get what I want, hey

Rewind and let's go back again, back to 1989
Black Box playing on the stereo
Like a prayer, we ride on time
Big hair is my prerogative
If you don't know me by now
I can't take much more Karate Kid
I'mma show you how

Time has gone and my love is trouble
Get me more, yeah, you're now my trouble
Ay-ay-ay, no way-ay-ay
I gotta be the situation, but I find a way to fire
Never giving up, I'm taking it higher
Ay-ay-ay, no way-ay-ay

I'm too young to remember
I wanna get, wanna get what I want, hey
I'm too young to remember
I wanna get, wanna get what I want, hey

Maybe if I took another chance I could live forever like this
Maybe I could dance all night to forget what I shouldn't have missed
I don't wanna hear about the girl with the halo doing no wrong
I could live my life like that, but I know that I wouldn't last long
Feeling too young to run, feeling to young to care about what happens
Too young to run, and I won't throw it all away
All I want is some fun, it don't mean I don't care about what matters
Tell me I'm wrong cause only one thing I gotta say

I'm too young to remember
I wanna get, wanna get what I want, hey
I'm too young to remember
I wanna get, wanna get what I want, hey

Too young to remember
Too young to remember
