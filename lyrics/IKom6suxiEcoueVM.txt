You're whining bitching all day long
You don't connect you don't belong
When you wanna 'fess up
And you wanna come clean
It's like taking a kick in the spleen

Could you dial back just
A notch I'm asking...
Will you won't you do you don't you
With the insecurities that you're masking
Not that I would do but could you

You wear things out like
The air we breathe
You care about things
Like what's underneath
You rant about shit and nobody cares
Take a tumble down in a flight of stairs

Could you dial back
Just a notch I'm asking...
Will you won't you do
You don't you
With the insecurities
That you're masking
Not that I would do but could you

Your sob stories are the
Oldest ones in the book
Will you won't you do you don't you
That's what we call a storm in a tea cup
Not that I would do but could you
