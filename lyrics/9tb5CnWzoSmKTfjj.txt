I'm the trouble starter, punk and instigator
I'm the fear addicted, danger illustrated
I'm a firestarter, twisted firestarter
I'm the b***h you hated, filth infatuated
I'm the pain you tasted, well intoxicated
You're the firestarter, twisted firestarter
I'm the self inflicted, mind detonator
I'm the one infected, twisted animator
I'm a firestarter, You're a firestarter
