I can't believe I could have been so blind
But love is strange
I thought about it for a long long time
But the truth remains
I don't need another lonely night
To dry my tears
The answer's plain as black and white
And I can see the picture very clear

I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye

It isn't like you never had the chance
To change your tune
Did you think that I'm a dime a dance
Well the dance is through
I've been doing things for way too long
But baby that's over (baby that's over)
It won't be easy but I gotta be strong
And if I wanna cry I don't need your shoulder

I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye

I'll find someone else
Who's nothing like you
Two can play the game as well
And your gonna be sorry baby
When it's over

I've been doing things for way too long
But baby that's over (baby that's over)
It won't be easy but I gotta be strong
And if i wanna cry I don't need your shoulder

I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye

I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
