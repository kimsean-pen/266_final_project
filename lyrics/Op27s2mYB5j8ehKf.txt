Subconscious strange sensation
Unconscious relaxation
What a pleasant nightmare
And I can't wait to get there again

Every time I close my eyes
There's another vivid surprise
Another whole life waiting
Chapters unfinished, fading

Closer now
Slowly comin' into view
I've arrived
Blinding sunshine beamin' through

There's a house I'm drawn to
Familiar settings nothing new
And there's a pathway leading there
With a hauntin' chill in the air

There's a room at the top of the stairs
Every night I'm drawn up there
And there's a girl in the mirror
Her face is gettin' clearer

Young child, won't you tell me
Why I'm here?

In her eyes
I sense a story never told
Behind the disguise
There's something tearing at her soul

Tonight I've been searching for it
A feeling that's deep inside me
Tonight I've been searching for
The one that nobody knows
Trying to break free

I just can't help myself
I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head
Tears my heart into two
I'm not the one the sleeper thought he knew

Back on my feet again
Eyes open to the real world
Metropolis surrounds me
The mirror's shattered the girl

Why is this other life
Haunting me every day?
I'd break through to the other side
If only I'd find the way

Is something's awfully familiar?
The feeling's so hard to shake
Could I have lived in that other world?
It's a link that I'm destined to make

Still searchin' but I don't know what for
The missing key to unlock my mind's door

Today I am searching for it
A feeling that won't go away
Today I am searching for
The the one that I only know
Trying to break free

I just can't help myself
I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head
Tears my soul into two
I'm not the one I thought I've always knew

I just can't help myself
I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head
Uncanny, strange deja vu
But I don't mind, I hope to find the truth
