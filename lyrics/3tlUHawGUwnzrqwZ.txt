If I look
or if I don't look
clouds are always passing over
the place I live.
The place I live
passing under
my feet while my mind wanders
in a sea of fog.
On a ridge
seeing through a hole in the fog
("A thought out of nowhere comes passing through")
I say to myself
("I say to myself, like a voice on the wind")
"Behold"
but I see nothing.
Rocks and water and wood
not speaking to me.

("wanderer above the sea of fog")
I mean the place lives
and clouds pass over
("sitting on a ridge and watching clouds pass over")
the landscape
a blanket on stone
("where an ocean of glaciers rolled")
Land waves are rolling.
("Through a fog, this is a brief life.")
("Short and cold, momentarily.")
("A life as brief as the morning fog")
Momentarily,
I come out from under.
