Drink deep, it's just a taste, and it might not come this way again,
I believe in moments, transparent moment, moments in grace when you've got to stake your faith

(but why do I confine, when all I want is release?)

It moves outside you, it stays inside you,
And it's not something that I could prove,
Or could chose, to be moved.
Yes it's a promise, and it's a threat,
And it's not something that I'll let you for get,
Not just yet, not just yet

(but why do I chase when all I want is near?)

If it's not the rule then it's always the case,
Good intentions get fractured, good intentions get replaced,
So close to reach but so hard to hold,
The only chance you get is past your control, it's so hard, it's so hard.

Drink deep, it's just a taste and it might not come this way again,
Time to surrender, sweet surrender of all things in time, all things one place, one place.
