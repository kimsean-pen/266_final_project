Oh, now that you're no longer mine
Baby the thought makes me cry
But then I think of the reasons why
And I find myself
Wiping these tears, dry

But if you can't love this all goes away
If you can't love this all goes away

Oh, now that that I'm no longer yours
What does this realization employ?
You wanted me to completely ignore my ways
What I was made for

Well if you can't love this all goes away
If you can't love this all goes away
If you can't love
If you can't love
Can't love
Can't love
If you can't love

This all goes away
Every cruel word
Every pain
For a day
Every cruel word
Every pain
For a day
Every cruel word
Every pain
For a day
But if love takes its grasp on you
It may lead the right way
While I hope for your sake
Anyway
