the asphalt is leaning on me like a mountain.
the pressure is building and i'm exhausted.
i know you know there is nowhere to go.
knowing is trying; its not a secret.
i know you know there is nowhere to go.
i'm sleeping in a basement; it's cold and undusted.
the pictures are hanging all my walls like a guilliotine.
i know you know there is nowhere.
laying down here trying to think of nothing,
i know you know there is nowhere to go.
