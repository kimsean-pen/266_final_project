Far from their land
as they made their stand
They stood strong and the legend still lives on

1918 the great war rages on
A battalion is lost in the Argonne
Under fire there's nothing they can do
There's no way they can get a message through

Suffer heavy losses as the battle carries on
Liberty division standing strong

Far from their land
as they made their stand
A disregarded demand
It's surrender of die and the stakes are high
They live of they die there's no time for good bye

Weapon in hand they made their stand
Still disregarding demand
They would never comply
they would rather die
Broke through the blockade the were finally saved

Friendly fire munitions runnig low
the supplies the were dropped upon ther foe

1918 the war still rages on
the battalion still trapped in the Argonne

Chose not to surrender
they chose victory of defeat
Fallen brothers resting by their feet

Far from their land
as they made their stand
A disregarded demand
It's surrender of die and the stakes are high
They live of they die there's no time for good bye

Weapon in hand they made their stand
Still disregarding demand
They would never comply they would rather die
Broke through the blockade the were finally saved

Far from their land
as they made their stand
A disregarded demand
It's surrender of die and the stakes are high
Live of die who can tell there's no good bye

With a weapon in hand as they made their stand
Still disregarding demand
They would never comply
They would rather die
They stood strong and legend still lives on

Suffer heavy losses
throught the great war they stood strong
But the memory of the fallen still lives on

Far from their land
as they made their stand
A disregarded demand
It's surrender of die and the stakes are high
They live and they die
there's no time for good bye

Weapon in hand they made their stand
Still disregarding demand
They would never comply they would rather die
Broke through the blockade the were finally saved
