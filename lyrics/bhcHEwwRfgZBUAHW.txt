Nobody else can risk fucking with their name
So I'll come out and lay waste to good taste for you babe
Hate comes easy
But with you I come hard
Happy anniversary from the bottom of my credit card
Who was that inside you that made me feel so cock strong?
I wish the truth could do to you what your Snapchat put me through

Woman, I make war to you
If you give a fuck enough, you'll make war too
God damn, is this routine to you?
Woman

I'm so bored of digging your trenches
When all this time it was for your affection that's a lesson
Sometimes you gotta leave that god damn thing right where you lost it
I don't dig up the living corpses of scene whore kids; I just court them

Woman, I make war to you
If you give a fuck enough, you'll make war too
God damn is this routine to you?
Woman

Who was that inside you that made me feel so gone?
From your smile to your core, all I see is love gore
From your smile to your core, get off the bed and out the door
All I see, all I see is love gore
From your smile to your core, get off the bed and out the door
All I see, all I see is love gore

Woman, I make war to you
If you give a fuck enough,
You'll make war too
You'll make war too
You'll make war too
You'll make war too
