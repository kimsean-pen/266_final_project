This is a short race, this is a short life
Let's run, not walk, through this beautiful life
This is a good day, this is a good sign
You've got green eyes and I've got sunrise

We're falling sideways, big lights freeways
Heart beats through me, through this beautiful life

We're talking dreams maybe
Let's run away to New York City
We're talking dreams baby
We'll cut the strings maybe
Through rose-colored lenses
Try not to forget it
We're talking dreams maybe
We're talking dreams baby, yeah

(We're talking dreams baby)

This is a short race, this is a short life
Let's run, not walk, through this beautiful life
This is a good day, this is a good sign
You've got green eyes and I've got sunrise
