Mind
Flowers ~
Pretty
Mind flowers

Take a trip
To the center
Of your mind
To your mind

Letting only
Your conscience
Be your guide

Finding out
That life is
Where its edge
Where its edge

Sacrifice!
Of your ego!
Sacrifice,
Sacrifice.

Let it go!
Let it go!
Let it go!
Let it go!
Let it go!
Let it go!

Falling sounds explode
Across myriad conscience
Of tomorrow's mind

You feel yourself
Rising slowly
And yet falling down
Upon shattered dreams

Crystal sights are
Shattered and distorted
By reality's truth

Again.
You hear the crying
Of a thousand harpies
As tomorrow is gone

You are cleansed
You are cleansed
You are cleansed
You are cleansed
You will never hear
Distortion again

I am falling
I am falling
I am falling
Into the quicksand
of my troubled mind
my troubled mind
my troubled mind
my troubled mind

Peace,
Tranquillity,
Mind flowers ~

Pretty
Mind flowers ~

Mind flowers.
MIND FLOWERS!
