Too many people, places, calling opportunity
Can't settle down, so many problems that we've got to be
One shot, working America
Can't stop, feeling invincible
There's no limit how far we'll go
You will not believe, how

We don't have the time
For another lie
We don't have the time

We go out, stay late
Make no mistake
(We know how to get things done)
Truth, lies, we'll fake
We make or break
(We know how to get things done)

So if you want it bad, you
If you wanna take the lead
You gotta work on how to play
You keep it up to speed

We don't have the time
For another lie
We don't have the time

We go out, stay late
Make no mistake
(We know how to get things done)
Truth, lies, we'll fake
We make or break
(We know how to get things done)

Every hour of the day
No one else gotta wait
We're making it count
(We know how to get things done)
Every surplus night
Only giving hours away
We'll be there in the crowd
(We know how to get things done)
(We know how to get things done)

We go out, stay late
Make no mistake
(We know how to get things done)
Truth, lies, we'll fake
We make or break
(We know how to get things done)

Every hour of the day
No one else gotta wait
We're making it count
(We know how to get things done)
Every surplus night
Only giving hours away
We'll be there in the crowd
(We know how to get things done)
