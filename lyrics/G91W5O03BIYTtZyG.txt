Prejudice, wrote a song about it?
Like to hear it? Here it goes

Free your mind

I wear tight clothing, high heeled shoes
It doesn't mean that I'm a prostitute no, no
I like rap music, wear hip hop clothes
That doesn't mean that I'm out sellin' dope no, no, no

Oh my, forgive me for having straight hair no
It doesn't mean there's another blood in my heirs
Yeah, yeah
I might date another race or color
It doesn't mean I don't like my strong black brothers

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why, oh why must it be this way?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Before you can read me you got to learn how to see me

(I said)
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow

So I'm a sista
Buy things with cash
That really doesn't mean that all my credit's bad
Ohh

So why dispute me and waste my time?
Because you really think the price is high for me
I can't look without being watched no
You rang my buy before I made up my mind
Ohh!

Oh now attitude why even bother?
I can't change your mind, you can't change my color

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why, oh why must it be this way?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Before you can read me you got to learn how to see me

(I said)
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow

Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why, oh why must it be this way?
Before you can read me you got to learn how to see me

(I said)
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow

Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow

Free your mind
