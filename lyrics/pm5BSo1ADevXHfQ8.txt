You're on the go
You're always wanna go
You want to go somewhere
Where you don't know

And when you run
And when I try to run
You leave me bent over
With a stitch in the road

You are a maze
A complex sum
I've counted all my fingers
And I'm on to my thumb

You are a storm
You are my little storm
I watch the wind change
To find out where you've been blown

Pull it up
And steer it up
This game is over

You conjure a key
In the palm of your hand
You're burning all yours
Drawing a line in the sand

We travel far
Catch the last of the sun
We keep on going
Til we've nowhere to run

Look at the hills
They look so green
The horizon is the place
That you always dream

We shoot the nest
Like a bolt from a gun
You're tapping on the door
To the beat of the drum

Hold it up
And steer it up
This game is over

Look at the [?]
They look so free
It's the only real thing
That's been happening to me

You're taking all
You thought was wrong
You used to follow lyrics
Of your favorite song

You are a maze
A complex sum
I've counted all my fingers
And I'm on to my thumb

You are a storm
You are my little storm
I watch the wind change
To find out where you've been blown
