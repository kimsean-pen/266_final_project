There are things I could've told you
There's a time and a place
Where my words would allow me
To say what I want changed

Don't let me know as it's happening
Don't let me know what you've said

There were birds all around me
There were flowers pressed to my face
And in time you will forget me
And I'll try and do the same

Don't let me know as it's happening
Don't let me know what you've said

It's been years since I saw you
But each day I see your face
And in time you will remind me
That I wish we were the same

Don't let me know as it's happening
Don't let me know what you've said
