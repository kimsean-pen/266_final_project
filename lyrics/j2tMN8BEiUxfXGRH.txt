Shiver away, I thought the action was real
Somewhere I know that's just the way you are
It's hard to believe that you're a part of me
I can't believe when you carry on and on
I can't believe you got that right (oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo)
I can't believe you got that right (oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo)
Just as the radio goes on and on
Yeah, I can't believe you got that right

Shiver away, after the years passed us by
Make no mistake, we don't know who you are
And sometime in the mirrors, you get to me every time
And I can't believe when you carry on and on
I can't believe you got that right (oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo)
I can't believe you got that right (oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo)
Just as the radio on and on and on
Yeah, I can't believe you got that right

Shiver away, I thought the action was real
Somewhere I know that's just the way you are
So let me believe, let me be anything at all
'Cause I can't believe when you carry on and on
I can't believe you got that right (oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo)
I can't believe you got that right (oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo)
Just as the radio goes on and on
Yeah, I can't believe you got that right
