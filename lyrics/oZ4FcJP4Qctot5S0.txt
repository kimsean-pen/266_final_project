Lately I have no faith in myself
I have nothing offered but myself
And I wake up and it's lonely
And I think of you in that city
Or you're driving your car
And all the things we will do
When you are back again
It keeps me alive

Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness
Your tenderness

This world is a cold one
I'll never understand
And I feel like I've been hiding
All my life
Sometimes I wish the sea would open up
And take me
But then I think of you
And how you're strong and you're delicate
And that makes it alright

Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness
Your tenderness

Oh if there's anyone
Who can mend my heart
It's got to be you
Oh if there's anyone
Who can mend my heart
Well it's got to be you
It's got to be you

Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness
Your tenderness
