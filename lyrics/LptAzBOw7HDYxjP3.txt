I find myself daydreaming of a better world
Memories can bleed in my open heart
London clouds are crying
But I'm dancing in the pouring rain
Grown up life is to learn not to fall apart

And I'm closer to high vibrations
Earning all the sweeter and deeper waves
And what I can do, to make it
To be at peace
And be true to me, in every way

I know I'll be alright
I know that I'll survive
I know I'll rise above it
'Cause I believe in love
And even when it's hard
Living with my scars
It never miles to nothing
'Cause I believe in love

Nobody tells me how to grow, no
I just gotta know
Emotional, but I won't define myself on the past
Balance is key
Understanding I can won't be always in control
Sometimes the right road goes by
Taking the broken path

Now I'm closer to high vibrations
Earning all the sweeter and deeper waves
And what I can do, to make it
To be at peace
Be true to me, in every way

I know I'll be alright
I know that I'll survive
I know I'll rise above it
'Cause I believe in love
And even when it's hard
Living with my scars
It never miles to nothing
'Cause I believe in love

Yes
Keep it simple
Follow my heart
This love I'm into, yes
Can rush the all I trust now
The more the time flies away
The closer it feels to wise with age
No energy is giving me life

'Cause I believe in love
(I believe, I believe in love, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I believe)
'Cause I believe in love
(I believe, I believe in love, ooh yeah, yeah)
'Cause I believe in love
(I believe, woah-oah-oah)
Ohh, 'cause I believe in love
(I believe in love)
I believe in love

And we're done
