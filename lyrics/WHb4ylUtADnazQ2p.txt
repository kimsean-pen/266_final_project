When you look at me, tell me what you see
Do you see no love at all?
Or do you see in me what you always see in every girl that you fall for?
I will show you how love is meant to be
Just watch and learn and listen to me
Will you ever see the day, heartache leads astray?
Good love will always come from me
Will you ever learn to love without a little doubt?
Good love will always come from me
When you look away is it mean to say that she haunts you night and day?
And does it hurt your heart when I say, "Let's start", to heal the part that's been torn?
Don't you see that I, I'm really worth a try?
And I say to you, "I know just what to do"
Will you ever see the day, heartache leads astray?
Good love will always come from me
Will you ever learn to love without a little doubt?
Good love will always come from me

Will you ever see the day, (Heartache) heartache leads astray?
Good love will always come from me
Will you ever learn to love without a little doubt?
Good love will always come from me
Will you ever see the day, heartache leads astray?
Good love will always come from me
... Ever learn to love without a little doubt?
Good love will always come from me
