How can you feel content
With this world so cold?
Just forgotten souls
We are on our own
The sin of sins is to scorch the earth
Till there is nothing left
There is nothing left

Blackhole
Swallow us all
Reset the switch
Return to old
Blackhole
Swallow us all
Reset the switch
Return to old

Restart the age
Ignite the fire
Our time erased
Is all that's left
In search of this
Free from the pain
We can aspire
We cannot take
This constant ache
Can we return from this?

We've turned the sea from the land
Arrogance of man
Believing it's our given right
We're taking all that we can
Bodies piled high to fuel the fires
Creation of destruction that never tires

Blackhole
Swallow us all
Reset the switch
Return to old
Blackhole
Swallow us all
Reset the switch
Return to old

Restart the age
Ignite the fire
Our time erased
Is all that's left
In search of this
Free from the pain
We can aspire
We cannot take
This constant ache
Can we return from this?

Take it back
Take it back
Take it all back
To the place
The time and the moment
Can we make
Can we make
Can we make it right?
Build it from the ground
And let us shine
Our souls aligned
Let us shine
Our souls aligned

Restart the age
Ignite the fire
Our time erased
Is all that's left
In search of this
Free from the pain
We can aspire
We cannot take
This constant ache
Can we return?
