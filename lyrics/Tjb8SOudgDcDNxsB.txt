When the lights go down
I see hell in you
But you don't care, no
You don't care, no
You'd just rather watch me fall
From a quarter mile, I can see you at the call
Think about it, or I won't tell you what I saw
When you break it off, you'll see who had it all
You had it all

You said you wanted to fall into Oblivion
Forget about the world we're living in
Fall into Oblivion
I'm going in!

Fall into Oblivion

Fall into Oblivion
Forget about the world we're living in
Fall into Oblivion
I'm going in!

You can't fall asleep when you're counting stars
Get it together
Now you wanna see me fall
From a quarter mile, I can see you at the call
Think about it, or I won't tell you what I saw
When you break it off, you'll see who had it all
You had it all

You said you wanted to fall into Oblivion
Forget about the world we're living in
Fall into Oblivion
I'm going in!

Fall into Oblivion

Fall into Oblivion
Forget about the world we're living in
Fall into Oblivion
I'm going in!
