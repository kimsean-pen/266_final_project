Frostbitten I became
Forthwith to see
Crystalized dimensions
To where the unfaithful fly
You might say
I'm demonized
but yet not the only one
You must come to me
There are nocturnal paths
To follow
Painted faces
From earlier centuries
Wander by desecrating winds
Binded shadows
Cast out from daylight
And from the beaten lands
Frostbitten I became
Forthwith to see
Crystalized dimensions
To where the unfaithful fly
You might say
I'm demonized
but yet not the only one
You must come to me
There are
Nocturnal path to follow
Enjoying the circle of eminent silence
Amidst the glacial abyss
Join my yearning emptiness
And the knowing
Of being beneath
Grim and frostbitten kingdoms
