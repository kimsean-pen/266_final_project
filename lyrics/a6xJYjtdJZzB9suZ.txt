Remember when we were standing
Dappled and still unshaved
Hiding from hidden cameras
In the shadow of the cranes

The things that I stole I gave you
The things that you said you liked
I bought you those pretty things
But you gave them back

Now I don't know how to reach you
I don't know where to look
I turn away from my mistakes
Try not to look

And I don'k know how to reach you
I don't know where to look
I turn away, I fold the page, I close the book

I'd steal a shadow for you
I'd love you like a knife
From the towers I try to call you
From the depths of the power lines

Tell me the things that scare you
Touch me with terror's flame
Fill me with hesitation, again

Cause I don't know how to reach you
I don't know where to look
I turn away from my mistakes
Try not to look

And I don'k know how to reach you
I don't know where to look
I turn away, I fold the page, I close the book

And I don'k know how to reach you
I don't know where to look
I turn away, I fold the page, I close the book

I never thought it would happen
I never thought it would happen
I never thought it would happen
I never thought it would happen
I never thought it would happen
I never thought it would happen
I never thought it would happen
I never thought it would happen

Happen to me
Happen to me
