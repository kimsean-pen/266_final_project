Catch me in the back in all black
I be that shadow hovering just like the
shallow end bubbling up with blood and guts
I used to be known as a shark attack,
but now I'm hot like the cherry on my bitch's blunt wrap
Because I am the wave
Yung Plague the hurricane
I am the wave as I crash on the shore flooding the trail you paved
Move out my way bitch, I'm making a stain
Bleach ain't the way to remove all the grey
Hating 'cause I took the wind out of your sails
Now you dried up and salty 'cause I am the wave
I was the shipwreck, but then I sank
Full moon, hope you don't cry wolf
High Tide in the Snake's Nest, I'm the mongoose
Some say you can see the blue sky dilute
As I blow another grey cloud
Hangin' my noose

Fuck do you mean we not running the scene?
Took us only one year to be underground kings
Straight out of hell with the intent to sell
Y'all been doing this shit since the year 2012
Fuck do you mean when you say you don't see us
That grey that surrounds you created by Jesus
But Jesus is me I'm Yung Christ, I'm that leader
Better be careful when threading that needle
Word around town Lil Slick got a murder charge
Whipping cop cars while I'm gone off them Xanny bars
Don't you fucking reach for life
Bitch take this knife
Tape his mouth and cut the lights
Time for the last rites
