she walks here on sundays
so close yet so far away
she moves like a sunset
all eyes on her

and she's entitled to
and she's entitled to

let me see her
I hang around the bus stop
all the trees bow down

she's not in a hurry
smiles back for the fun of it
she points at the skyline
like it's hers to take

and she's entitled to
and she's entitled to

let me see her
I hang around the bus stop
all the trees low down

let me see her
I hang around the bus stop
all the trees low down
