Yesterday was a million years ago,
In all my past lives I played an asshole.
Now I found you, it's almost too late,
And this earth seems obliviating.

We are trembling in our crutches,
High and dead our skin is glass.
I'm so empty here without you,
I crack my xerox hands.

I know its the last day on earth,
We'll be together while the planet dies.
I know it's the last day on Earth,
We'll never say goodbye.

And the dogs slaughter each other softly,
Love burns its casualties.
We are damaged provider modules,
Spill the seeds at our children's feet.
I'm so empty here without you,
I know they want me dead.

And I know its the last day on Earth,
We'll be together while the planet dies.
And I know it's the last day on Earth,
We'll never say goodbye.

And I know its the last day on Earth,
We'll be together while the planet dies.
And I know it's the last day on Earth,
We'll never say goodbye.

And I know its the last day on Earth,
We'll be together while the planet dies.
And I know it's the last day on Earth,
We'll never say goodbye.

And I know its the last day on Earth,
We'll be together while the planet dies.
And I know it's the last day on Earth,
We'll never say goodbye.

We'll never say goodbye
We'll never say goodbye
We'll never say goodbye
