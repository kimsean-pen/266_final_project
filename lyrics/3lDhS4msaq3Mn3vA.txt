Summer is here and the summer is gone
Buzzkill
Killing my fucking buzz, buzzkill!

I had good shit all lined up, then you fucking showed up
Buzzkill!
Killing my fucking buzz, buzzkill!

My heart sinks into the deep
When you inflict yourself on me
Buzzkill

Summer is here and then the summer is gone
(Fuck off, the summer is gone)
Killing my fucking buzz, buzzkill!

I had a sweet hook up, and you fucked it all up
Buzzkill
Killing my fucking buzz, buzzkill!

My heart sinks into the deep
When you inflict yourself on me
A dark cloud of jealousy
Pissing rain and misery, buzzkill

Summer is here and the summer is gone
Buzzkill
Fuck off, the summer is gone
Killing my fucking buzz, buzzkill!
Fuck off, the summer is gone
Killing my fucking buzz, buzzkill!
Fuck off, the summer is gone

Buzzkill, buzzkill, buzzkill!

Buzzkill!
