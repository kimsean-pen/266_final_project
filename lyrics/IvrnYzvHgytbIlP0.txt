I was halfway up on the wings of a fantasy
Looking out for love, didn't know what was good for me

I stay out every night
And live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up now baby
But nothing feels the same

I'd rather be with you
Then I look into his eyes and I realize
I'd rather be with you
Though I try to trick myself, there's nobody else
I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you

Fillings days with distractions, only a waste of time
No one can compare, only you made me come alive

You're the one I need
So give it up, give it up, give it up now baby
You only have to say

I'd rather be with you
Then I look into his eyes and I realize
I'd rather be with you
Though I try to trick myself, there's nobody else
I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you

No more fighting, need to get your love
I know you're trouble, but you're my number one
And I'm gonna leave it all behind
Cause I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you
Then I look into his eyes and I realize
I'd rather be with you
Though I try to trick myself...

I'd rather be with you
Then I look into his eyes and I realize
I'd rather be with you
Though I try to trick myself, there's nobody else
I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you

And I realize, and I realize...
