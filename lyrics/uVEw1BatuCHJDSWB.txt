went looking for someone I couldn't find
staring at faces by the Serpentine
Walking slowly I realised
you'd been and gone, I know you lied

That's my impression
That's my impression
That's my impression
That's my impression

The wind was chilly and the sky was dull
I went for shelter to the temple
Once inside I couldn't believe my eyes
You'd been and gone, I know you lied

That's my impression
That's my impression
That's my impression
That's my impression

Go to a club, you think I'll be there
I don't go 'cause I'm not a member
You said you went to apologise
It's plain to me that's one more lie

That's my impression
That's my impression
That's my impression
That's my impression

I went looking for someone I couldn't find
staring at faces by the Serpentine
Walking slowly, I realised
you'd been and gone, I know you lied

That's my impression
That's my impression
That's my impression
That's my impression

It's an expression
and a suggestion
I learned my lesson
That's my impression
