No blind spots in the leopard's eyes
Can only help to jeopardise
The lives of lambs
The shepherd cries

An outdoor life for a silverfish
Eternal dust
Less ticklish than the clean room
A houseguest's wish

He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth
He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth

Face worker, a serpentine miner
A roof falls
An underliner of leaf structure
The egg timer

He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth
He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth

He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth
He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth

He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth
He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth

He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth
He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth

He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth, which he's known since birth
He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
