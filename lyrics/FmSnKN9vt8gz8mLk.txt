talk to me, you're closest thing to a friend.
honesty went overlooked in the end.
i understand the situation you're in.
oh, poor aileen. you weren't treated like a human.
they took your veins. don't be afraid.
in the woods, you're sleeping out in the cold.
life's no good. they took you out of your home.
i understand the situation you're in. strapped to a bed.
everyone says that you're a monster in the way.
needle goes in. how did you live?
you didn't get a chance.
