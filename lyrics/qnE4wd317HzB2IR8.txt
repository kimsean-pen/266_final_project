Take another shot at me
I love the way you
HATE ME

I don't care if I'm not good enough for you
I don't care if I don't live the life you want me to
I don't care what you wanna think of me

'Cause all you are
Is everything
That I don't wanna be

You say
I'm a
Freak
I say
I am
Free
Come take a shot at me
I love the way you hate me

You say
I'm insane
I say
You're afraid
I get stronger from the pain
I love the way you hate me

Take another shot at me
I love the way you hate me

You think I'm nothing
'Cause I'm nothing like you
You think you know me
You have no idea what I've been through
So take your shot
Say what you want about me

'Cause all you are
Is everything
That I will never be
Fake

You say
I'm a
Freak
I say
I am
Free
Come take a shot at me
I love the way you hate me

You say
I'm insane
I say
You're afraid
I get stronger from the pain
I love the way you hate me

I'd rather be a sinner than a slave
I'd rather be an outcast than just bow down and obey
When it's all done there's only one
Name upon my grave
I'd rather be a freak than be a fake

Tell me
I'm a
Freak
Tell me
I'm a
Creep
Tell me
I'm obscene
HATE ME
You say
I'm insane
I say
You're afraid
I get stronger from the pain
I love the way you hate me
I love the way you hate me
(I don't care)
I love the way you HATE ME
(Hate me)
