Stick to your guns, they fail to protect
I've seen this before and we die in the end
Leapt without looking, we land in the flames
We don't even care anymore
Are you tired of being ignored?

Speak up now, you are not alone
This is not a joke, pick up the megaphone
Think out loud, what are you waiting for?
Clear your goddamn throat, you are the megaphone
Don't wait, don't turn away, don't choke on words you meant to say
Speak up now, you are not alone
This ain't a fucking joke, pick up the megaphone
Say something, anything to me
Can you feel something, anything for me
Because it's not enough to wait for the storm, to relent and give up

Speak up now, you are not alone
This is not a joke, pick up the megaphone
Think out loud, what are you waiting for?
Clear your goddamn throat, pick up the megaphone
Don't wait, don't turn away, or choke on words you meant to say

Speak up now, you are not alone
This is not a joke, pick up the megaphone
Say something, anything to me
Feel something, anything for me
Say something, say something, say something, say something
Speak up, you are not alone, you are the megaphone
Speak up, you are not alone
You are the megaphone
