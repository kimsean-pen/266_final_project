Yea you know
Only you, only you

Only you can make me feel
Just like a king
Love you give to me so real
Makes me give in

Girl, just like magnet to steel
Your love keeps pulling me in
If it's a battle I'll fight for you
I have to win

To prove to you my love
Is so deep within
It's even getting deeper
Since I reach prison

Longing for
My baby to love me more
What am I longing for?
Babylon release the Cure

What am I longing for?
My baby to love me more
What am I longing for?
Babylon release the Cure

When, when, when, when
Can we see each other again?
When, when, when, when
Can we see each other again?

I know there's someone must be there comforting you
Whenever you need a friend
I'll make you mine, give me some time
I'll surely make you mine

It may be long but not forever
I vow to get myself together
I love you baby, always on my mind
No matter the time

What am I longing for?
My baby to love me more
What am I longing, longing, longing?

What am I longing for?
My baby to love me more
What am I longing for?
Babylon release the Cure

Only you can make me feel
Just like a king
Love you give to me so real
Makes me give in

Girl, just like magnet to steel
Your love keeps pulling me in
If it's a battle I'll fight for you
Surely win
To prove to you my love
Is so deep within
It's even getting deeper
Ever since
What am I longing for?
My baby to love me more
What am I longing for?
Babylon release the Cure
What am I longing for?
What am I longing for?
