Lost in a world created by man
I can't recall how it all began
Tell me, who am I?

Fictional stars in lost galaxies
Synthetic dreams and false memories
Is this all a lie?

There is no escape
There is no way out of here
I'm locked in this universe
The real world will disappear
Where fantasy dies
You will see your dreams
Material lies
Materialize
Computer eyes
Computerize

Virtual reality, computer override
Actual fantasy, locked away inside

Am I no more than a program?
An artificial dream?
A river of electrons flowing with the stream?

A parallel dimension, battle simulations
Mind over matter, brain stimulation

I don't know if I exist. I think therefore I am.
Without emotions, I'm but a hologram.

There's no escape!
I'm locked in this universe
Where fantasy dies
Material lies
Computer eyes

There is no escape
There is no way out of here
I'm locked in this universe
The real world will disappear
Where fantasy dies
You will see your dreams
Material lies
Materialize
