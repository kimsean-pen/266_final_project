Everybody's laughin in my mind
Rumors spreadin about this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me
Does he love you the way I can
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me
'Cause baby I didn't

That should be me
Holdin your hand
That should be me
Makin you laugh
That should be me
This is so sad

That should be me
That should be me

That should be me
Feelin your kiss
That should be me
Buyin you gifts
This is so wrong
I can't go on
Till you believe

That that should be me
That should be me

Said you needed a little time
From my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time
To have me replaced

Did you think
That I wouldn't see you out at the movies
What you doin' to me?
Your taking him where we used to go
Now if your trying to break my heart
It's workin, 'cause you know

That should be me
Holdin your hand
That should be me
Makin you laugh
That should be me
This is so sad

That should be me
That should be me

That should be me
Feelin your kiss
That should be me
Buyin you gifts
This is so wrong
I can't go on
Till you believe

That that should be me

I need to know should I fight for love
Or disarm it's getting harder to shield
This pain in my heart, oh

That should be me
Holdin your hand
That should be me
Makin you laugh
That should be me
This is so sad

That should be me
That should be me

That should be me
Feelin your kiss
That should be me
Buyin you gifts
This is so wrong
I can't go on
Till you believe

That that should be me
(Holding your hand)

That should be me
(The one making you laugh, oh baby, oh)

That should be me (yeah)

That should be me
(Giving you flowers)

That should be me
(Talking for hours)

That should be me
That should me
That should be me

Never should have let you go
I never should have let you go
