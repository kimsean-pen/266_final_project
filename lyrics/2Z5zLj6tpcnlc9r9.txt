I catch you smile as you snooze
As contented as i'll ever be

Running risk of sounding crude
but your pizazz is "Michael Jackson bad"

Trying to keep my cool around you
Skip my played out, swoony antics

I drop whatever Im doing,
At first chance of you sending an adorable dog pic

Dont have a clue what I am doing,
More than half the time, at least google can help me rhyme

Trying to keep my cool around you
Skip my played out, swoony antics
Trying to keep my cool around you
