Take me anywhere
I am a nervous passenger
I'll make it back if I can
I won't make you wait forever

I swear I'll meet you
Where the violets in the spring bloom
I'm not the blood in my veins
I'm not the blood in my veins

So take me anywhere
I am a nervous passenger
I'll make it back if I can
I won't make you wait forever

If we're born to pawners, crooks and thieves
What more are we meant to be?
Is it too late to save me?
Or am I already a distant memory?
