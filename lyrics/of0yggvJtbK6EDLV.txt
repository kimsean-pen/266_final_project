Get up and shake it up
It's time that you listen up and hear the call

They love the waterbed and not your own fire packed against the wall

Don't stop
Try to make your mark and make your mind up
Don't stop
Work it out and try to make it

Randy
Get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better
Randy
You don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover

When you know you've arrived
And it's time
Don't you know
Aim it high
When you know you've arrived
And it's time
Take it slow
Shoot it high-igh-igh-igh...

Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know

Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know

Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know

Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know

Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know

Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know

Don't you know
Don't you know
