I'm ever so lost
I can't find my way
Been searchin' but I have never seen
A turnin', a turnin' from deceit

'Cause a child, roses light
Tried to reveal what I could feel

I can't understand myself
Anymore
'Cause I'm still feelin' lonely
Feelin' so unholy

'Cause a child, roses light
Tried to reveal what I could feel
I'm lonely
It just won't leave me alone
Ohh, ohh

Yea
Yea
{I think this is right}

I'm foolin' somebody
A faithless path I roam
Deceiving to breath this secretly
The silence, the silence I can't bear

'Cause a child roses light
Tries to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone
Ohh no
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone
A lady of war
A lady of war
