Smoking me out
Giddy up, giddy up
Time for the cool down
But I want the whole city
Gonna heat it up, heat it up

I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something
I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something
I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something
I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something

Wow, wooh!
Wow, wooh!

Walk in the shop,
Let's go
Wow, drink it up,
Drink it up
Meet me on the
Eastside, eastside
'Cause I needed much,
Needed much

I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something
I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something
I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something
I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something

Wow, wooh!
Wow, wooh!

Wow, wooh!
Wow, wooh!

No way to bone on this time
On the floor, six nine, six nine
No way to bone on this time
On the floor, six nine, six nine

I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something
I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something
I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something
I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something

I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something
I won't sleep, gotta
Get into something
I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something
I won't sleep, gotta
Get into something
Wow

I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something
I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something
I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something
I can't sleep, gotta
Get into something

Wow, wooh!
Wow, wooh!
