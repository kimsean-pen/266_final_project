The sky, is falling, on you, I know, what you're after.
My eyes, so cold and abused, I know, what you're after.

I feel the pain, wake up inside, I take the blame, so I can hide, all the scars.
You've stayed the same, so long I've tried, to break the chains, now I can find, all your scars.

Get me out of here, so I can breathe, it's all become, so clear.
What lies beneathe, your skin (your skin), it's thin (it's thin).
You're never gonna keep me down, get me out, just get me out of here.

Stuck in here I, need to leave (need to leave), stuck in here I'm, breaking free, breaking free.
