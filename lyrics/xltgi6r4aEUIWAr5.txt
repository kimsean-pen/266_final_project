Up in a sterilized room
where they let you be lazy
knowing your attitude's all wrong
and you got to change
and that's not easy
dragon shining with all values known
dazzling you-keeping you from your own
where is the lion in you to defy him
when you're this weak
and this spacey...
So what are you going to do about it
you can't live life and you can't leave it
advice and religion-you can't take it
you can't seem to believe it
the peacock is afraid to parade
you're under the thumb of the maid
you really can't give love in this condition
still you know how you need it
They open and close you
then they talk like they know you
they don't know you
they're friends and they're foes too
trouble child
breaking like the waves at malibu
So why does it come as such a shock
to know you really have no one
only a river of changing faces
looking for an ocean
they trickle through your leaky plans
another dream over the dam
and you're lying in some room
feeling like your right to be human
is going over too
well some are going to knock you
and some'll try to clock you
you know it's really hard
to talk sense to you
trouble child
breaking like the waves at malibu
