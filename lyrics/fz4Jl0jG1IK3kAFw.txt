You've got a price tag hanging on the back of your dress
You've got your shoes undone, and your hair's a mess
But no one sees you like I do
You roll the windows down when it's starting to rain
Yeah, everybody else might think you're insane
But no one sees you like I do
'Cause the little things, don't mean much to me my

Girl, I'd cross the whole world, for someone like you
Oh oh no matter where I go, Oh oh my unpredictable
Girl, you're impossible girl, you know that it's true
Oh oh no matter what you do, I'd cross the world for someone like you

You love to sing along when you don't know the words
You lock your keys in your car right next to your purse
Yeah no one sees you like I do
You only show up right out of the blue
Then 20 minutes late's 5 early for you
Yeah no one sees you like I do

'Cause the little things, don't mean much to me my

Girl, I'd cross the whole world, for someone like you
Oh oh no matter where I go, Oh oh my unpredictable
Girl, you're impossible girl, you know that it's true
Oh oh no matter what you do, I'd cross the world for someone like you

Yeah, you're perfectly imperfect my love
Oh, I'll be waiting up all night because your little things
All the stupid things, oh the little things, don't mean much to me my

Girl, I'd cross the whole world, for someone like you
Oh oh no matter where I go, Oh oh my unpredictable
Girl, you're impossible girl, you know that it's true
Oh oh no matter what you do, I'd cross the world for someone like you
