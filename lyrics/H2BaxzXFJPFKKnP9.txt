Who's got the brain of JFK?
What's it mean to us now, yeah?
Pause, it sounds distrust.
I can tell ya this is no lie

The Whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The Whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved

You, you been taught, whipped into shape
Now they've got you in line
Stand behind the stripes
That will be yours; so give it good mind

The Whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The Whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved

(Slow Part)
Lend my name
The name they gave me
The name I'm letting go.

The Whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The Whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved

The whole world will be different
The whole world will be relieved
The Whole world will be different soon
SOON!
