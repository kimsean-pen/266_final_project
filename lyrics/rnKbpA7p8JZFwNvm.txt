They say I'm an evil canibal
but I don't like the taste of meat
that's why i put you in a cage
and the waiting is worth it
i wait until i see my favorite bone
my favorite bone is on your hip

They say I'm a evil canibal
but I don't like too much meat
that's why i think it's better boy
boy it's better if you don't eat
it's the hard things that make me soft
It's the hard things that taste sweet.
