Back and forth I've been here before,
The words you said just left me on the floor,
And I came round the blue smoke from my mouth,
I thought I saw you in the clouds,
But I chose to forgive,
I find it hard to forget,
Even though you said it was something you'd regret.
It's in the back of my mind,
But it's worse when I sleep,
Now I'm losing my breath,
And I could never understand how you could forget me,
This feeling will only get better,
I'll just hold it all together,
Cause we are good for each other and this will pass like the weather.
We both know that it doesn't work,
I don't what to do without making it worse,
But I don't like who I am when I'm not with you,
I couldn't make sense of it,
I hadn't slept for days,
I never had the feeling that could make me throw up in the street.
It's in the back of my mind,
But it's worse when I sleep,
Now I'm losing my breath,
And I could never understand how you could forget me,
This feeling will only get better,
I'll just hold it all together,
Cause we are good for each other and this will pass like the weather.
