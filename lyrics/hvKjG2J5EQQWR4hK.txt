Striking at mental apparitions
Like a drunk on a vacant street
Silently beset by the hands of time
And elegant in its fury
An aberrant crack as skeletons yield
To unrelenting gravity
While viruses prowl for helpless victims
Who succumb rapidly

Tell me!
Tell me where is the love?
In a careless creation
When there's no "above"
There's no justice
Just a cause and no cure
And a bounty of suffering
It seems we all endure
And what I'm frightened of

is that they call it "God's love"
Well we twist in torment and make believe
There's a truth and we all submit
"Believe my eyes," my brain replies

To all that they interpret

So tell me!
Tell me where is the love?
In a careless creation

When there's no "above"
There's no justice

Just a cause and no cure
And a bounty of suffering
It seems we all endure
And what I'm frightened of
Is that they call it "God's love"
I know there's no reason for alarm
But who needs perspective when it comes to pain and harm
We can change our minds
there's a better prize
But first you've got to tell me!
Tell me where is the love?
In a careless creation
When there's no "above"
There's no justice
Just a cause and no cure
And a bounty of suffering
It seems we all endure
And what I'm frightened of
Is that they call it "God's love"
They call it God's love
My pain is God's love
