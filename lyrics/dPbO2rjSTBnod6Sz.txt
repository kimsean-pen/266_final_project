It's such a long way down
Down from the high.
You're like the lonely sound,
I can't deny.
I didn't know I was feeling best
Til you had me falling.
It's such a long way down
Down from the high.

You're running through my veins
Like fire, I dance in the ground
Like my heart I'd never been without you now
Now you're gone
And anybody tell me how
To break

Ha. of you

Cause now I'm feeling for you
(I'm strong now and you left)
You left me longing for you
(like I can't get enough)
Fall down and begging for you
Cause I can't give you up
Junkie, I'm like a junkie yeah
Junkie, I'm like a junkie yeah

Cause now I'm feeling for you
(I'm strong now and you left)
You left me longing for you
(like I can't get enough)
Fall down and begging for you
Cause I can't give you up
Junkie, I'm like a junkie yeah
Junkie, I'm like a junkie yeah

There's nothing I want more
Into leave you behind
If I could close this door
And watch us die

You're running through my veins
Like fire, I dance in the ground
Like my heart I'd never been without you now
Now you're gone
And anybody tell me how
To break

Ha. of you

Cause now I'm feeling for you
(I'm strong now and you left)
You left me longing for you
(like I can't get enough)
Fall down and begging for you
Cause I can't give you up
Junkie, I'm like a junkie yeah
Junkie, I'm like a junkie yeah

Cause now I'm feeling for you
(I'm strong now and you left)
You left me longing for you
(like I can't get enough)
Fall down and begging for you
Cause I can't give you up
Junkie, I'm like a junkie yeah
Junkie, I'm like a junkie yeah

Yeah yeah yeah Junkie, I'm like a Junkie
