I'm gonna stay
'Cause you're really tired
More than you have shown
Deep in your eyes
There's no desire
Burning anymore
'Cause the will to fight
Can just slowly die
In the heart of night
How could you survive
When the dimmest light
Never touched your eyes
This time we will
Turn around and say the words that make us heal
And then we will
We will know and never more go back to this
You gotta give something something something for love
You gotta give something something
You gotta give something something something for love
You gotta give something something
I won't deny
Your lack of compassion
Pain is all you know
Even a life
Torn up in fire
Shouldn't burn alone
Cause the will to fight
Can just slowly die
In the heart of night
How could you survive
When the dimmest light
Barely touched your eyes
This time we will
Turn around and say the words that make us heal
And then we will
We will know and never more go back to this
You gotta give something something something for love
You gotta give something something
You gotta give something something something for love
You gotta give something something
Flying high above an imagined ocean
Nothing holding you so fly away
When Im holding you only feel devotion
Just let go and let us heal
This time we will
Turn around and say the words that make us heal
And then we will
We will know and never more go back to this
You gotta give something something something for love
You gotta give something something
You gotta give something something something for love
You gotta give something something
