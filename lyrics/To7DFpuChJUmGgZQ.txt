Come to the dinner gong
the table is laden high
fat bellies and hungry little ones
tuck your napkins in
and take your share
some get the gravy
and some get the gristle
some get the marrow bone
and some get nothing
though there's plenty to spare
I took my share down by the sea
paper plates and javex bottles on the tide
seagulls come down
and they squawk at me
down where the water-skiers glide
Some turn to jesus
and some turn to heroin
some turn to rambling round
looking for a clean sky
and a drinking stream
some watch the paint peel off
some watch their kids grow up
some watch their stocks and bonds
waiting for that big deal
american dream
I took my dream down by the sea
yankee yachts and lobster pots and sunshine
and logs and sails
and shell oil pails
dogs and tugs and summertime
back in the banquet line
angry young people crying
Who let the greedy in
and who left the needy out
who made this salty soup
tell him we're very hungry now
for a sweeter fare
in the cookie i read
"some get the gravy
and some get the gristle
some get the marrow bone
and some get nothing
though there's plenty to spare"
