I've been in a rut
Back and forth enough
Heart like a wheel
Without you around, so uncomfortable is how it feels
Every time you're near
Trouble disappears under the ground

But when you go to far, silver clouds will start hanging around
And I know why
Try to run, but I keep on
Coming back
Full circle, and I can't jump the track
Can't let you go, oh oh oh
Try to once so I keep on

Coming back
Full circle 'cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around
Skippin down a broken path, how long can I last?
Please let me know oh
Where's the finish line? 'cause I've got to find somewhere to go
I don't want to hear people interfere
What do they know,
What I feel inside when I'm up all night needing you home?
I don't know why
Try to run but I keep on

Coming back
Full circle and I can't jump the track
Can't let you go, oh oh oh
Try to once so I keep on
Coming back
Full circle 'cause I know you'll come around

You'll come around
'Cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around
I keep on runnin' till we meet in the middle
I'll push right aside and I'll give just a little
There's miles to go, but wait
Don't hold back, we'll make it

And I know why
Try to run but I keep on
Coming back
Full circle and I can't jump the track
Can't let you go, oh
Try to once so I keep on
Coming back
Full circle 'cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around
Yeah, I know you'll come around, you'll come around
Yeah, I know you'll come around, you'll come around
