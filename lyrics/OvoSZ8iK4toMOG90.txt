Fading out in black and white
I see technicolor lights
Our names written in the sky
Everything is ours tonight
Gonna leave it all to fade
Show it off like fever case
Leave it up and blame my age Young enough to make mistakes
Better than the movies
Better than the movies

Better than the movies
When we give it all we've got It's better than the movies
Better than the movies
Better than the movies

Better than the movies

When we give it all we've got It's better than the movies
Every moment is a dream
Every time we make a scene
Life is like a silver screen
We were born to take the lead
Never gonna let it go

Gonna give'em all a show
Walking to the After Globe

Stop and let the credits roll
Better than the movies
Better than the movies
Better than the movies
When we give it all we've got It's better than the movies
Better than the movies (better, better)
Better than the movies (better, better)
Better than the movies
When we give it all we've got It's better than the movies
Better than the movies (So much better than the movies)
Better than the movies (So much better than the movies)
Better than the movies
When we give it all we've got it's better than the movies Oh-oh-oh
Better than the movies (better, better)
Better than the movies (better, better)
Better than the movies When we give it all we've got It's better than the movies
