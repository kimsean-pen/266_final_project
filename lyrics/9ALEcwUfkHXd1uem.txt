Let the wind take care of gravity
There's one big secret hidden, come with me
Why should I want to leave,
Unless you wanted me to go away

Speak with a tongue that claims its kingdom,
come what may...
The stars came tumbling down
Worn-out heroes
Stepping into fields of firing grey

My restless soul will dance in harmony
In open air a subdued symphony
I've set myself an aim to keep the territory that I claim
I'll never let my kingdom fall

There's nothing keeping us in here
Abounded fear
Let me be free...

Speak with a tongue that claims its kingdom,
Come what may...
The stars came tumbling down
Worn-out heroes
Stepping into fields of firing grey
Speech of the deadland
Let them hear the song is still alive

Give me something I could sleep on
Give me something like a dream...
