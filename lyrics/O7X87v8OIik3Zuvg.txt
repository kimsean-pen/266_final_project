Jackie is a punk,
Judy is a runt
They both went down to Berlin,
joined the ice capades.

And oh, I don't know why
Oh, I don't know why
Perhaps they'll die,
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die,
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die,
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die,
Oh yeah

Second verse, same as the first,

Jackie is a punk,
Judy is a runt
They both went down to Berlin,
joined the ice capades.

And oh, I don't know why
Oh, I don't know why
Perhaps they'll die,
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die,
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die,
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die,
Oh yeah

Third verse, different from the first,

Jackie is a punk,
Judy is a runt,
They both went down to Frisco,
Joined the SLA.

And oh, I don't know why,
Oh, I don't know why
Perhaps they'll die,
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die,
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die,
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die,
Oh yeah!
