Here as I stand,
All the sounds become so clear
To get back home again
Sometimes I lose my way
Because I'm bound to fall and just lose it all
Am I running outta time?

I'm breaking the chain
From the life I knew
Beaten black and blue
It's time to be face to face
With the lies I choose
Pull the truth into the light
I make no mistake
I've paid my price
I've done my time
With the devil in disguise
'Cause the life I knew has a different view tonight
I'm breaking the chain

Days pass me by
Like I'm saving wasted time
I'm not alright
I think I'm falling for the lie
As it fades to black
I'm not looking back
I'm still blinded by the lies

I'm breaking the chain
From the life I knew
Beaten black and blue
It's time to be face to face
With the lies I choose
Pull the truth into the light
Make no mistake
I've paid my price
I've done my time
With the devil in disguise
'Cause the life I knew has a different view tonight
I'm breaking the chain

'Cause I'm done chasing
Chasing yesterday
(I've lost all feeling)
Scars don't fade
They never go away
And I'm still bleeding
Every step that I take
All the chains that I break
It brings me one step closer

(Breaking the chain)

I'm breaking the chain
From the life I knew
Beaten black and blue
It's time to be face to face
With the lies I choose
Pull the truth into the light
Make no mistake
I've paid my price
I've done my time with the devil in disguise
'Cause the life I knew has a different view tonight
I'm breaking the chain

I'm breaking the chain
I'm breaking the chain
