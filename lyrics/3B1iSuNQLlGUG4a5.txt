Corpse carried to the guardhouse
The more things change the more they stay the same
To coexist is to destroy yourself
Godless factions, heathens, wage war arise
Deviation won't be tolerated
Eternally perpetuated myth has gone beyond the core of grief
And leaves behind a path to how it must feel
To be the creator in the times before creation
Before their suffering could stir its troubled sleep
The loneliness once faced pales to the shame of mankind's dawning
The final act of penitence
Deviation won't be tolerated
Malignant delusions of the soul
The only way to protect you from yourself
Obey the fabrication or face imaginary punishment
A new age will arise from the blood and the ignorance
The final wishes of humanity are systematically ignored
Your heaven never existed at all
Deviation won't be tolerated
Malignant delusions of the soul
The only way to protect you from yourself
Obey the fabrication or face imaginary punishment
A new age will arise from the blood and the ignorance
How it must feel to be reborn
And follow black market peddlers of vice as messiah
