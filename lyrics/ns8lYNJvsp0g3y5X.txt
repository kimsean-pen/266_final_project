Welcome to the hotel in California
He pushes her chair and wheels her inside
They can hear the rain and wonder where it's going
Tuesday's rain
Tuesday's rain
They used to not dare
But now they love to go dancing
And with a little swivel he can spin her around
'Cause when love shows it's face
The rest just falls into your place
And all of the pain
All of the pain
That followed the lady in waiting
Lady in waiting
For a heart not alone anymore
Riding on a bus on the way to the airport
A couple stares, she knows the feeling well
But like her father used to say
Forgive and walk away
Tuesday's rain
Tuesday's rain
