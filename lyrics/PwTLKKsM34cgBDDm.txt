I am battle tested twice, arrested
Think I'd never wanna come down
You guessed it
Well, rested, God blessed
And they keep to bein' too fuckin' dope
I confessed it

'Cause there ain't no rest for
The wicked when I kick it
Burn the evidence like a tricky (Tricky)
'Cause there ain't no rest for
The wicked when I stick it
Danger imminent, this is it, kid

We ain't got no place to go
We ain't got nothin' to show
But if you don't gather, we don't get
Watch it all go up in smoke (All go up in smoke)
Yeah, we got no place to go
We ain't got nothin' to show
But if you don't gather, we don't get
Watch it all go up in smoke (All go up in smoke)

Elevated too 'cause I'm faded
Comin' off smooth 'cause
My rhymes are lubricated
X-rated, sophisticated
Chrome to the dome and the shit is gold-plated

'Cause there ain't no rest for
The wicked when I kick it
Burn the evidence like a tricky (Tricky)
'Cause there ain't no rest for
The wicked when I stick it
Danger imminent, this is it, kid

We ain't got no place to go
We ain't got nothin' to show
But if you don't gather, we don't get
Watch it all go up in smoke (All go up in smoke)
Yeah, we got no place to go
We ain't got nothin' to show
But if you don't gather, we don't get
Watch it all go up in smoke (All go up in smoke)

Click, clack, I say fuck that
Coppers on the line shout
Hootie-hoo, then I hook back
And grab my backpack and feel my back crack
All the pressures of the world makin' contact
We all low ride, we carry no knives
I got a bike and it glow so I go ride
Ride around as the wheels so round
We go, ride around, check my bicycle glow

We ain't got no place to go
We ain't got nothin' to show
But if you don't gather, we don't get
Watch it all go up in smoke

Yeah, we got no place to go
We ain't got nothin' to show
But if you don't gather, we don't get
Watch it all go up in smoke

Yeah, we got no place to go
We ain't got nothin' to show
But if you don't gather, we don't get
Watch it all go up in smoke
