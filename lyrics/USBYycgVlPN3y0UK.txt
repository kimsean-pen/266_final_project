Old man give me endless time
Never let these ties sever
It's breaking bottles in the yard
Never still my mind again

Mmm

Like old ties and companions
Just sitting on the fence

The tears we've carried through the years will change
And man that's just enough
To keep these ghosts around those haunted fields

Mmm

Like old ties and companions
You and I were just passing through

It's a hundred thousand miles of lonely track
Holding back tomorrow
Someday I'll hop along and ride it home

Like old ties and companions
We never leave alone

So old man give me endless time never let these ties sever
So heaven knows and all this fooling around
These times won't last forever, afterall
