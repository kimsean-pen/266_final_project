I hate this lands
The dimension of flesh
Lifeless I am
But still I breathe

Cold as winter I stalk the gates
As reaching out from unearthed grave
Black Dragon in my dreams
Spread your wings of poison
I hate this maze, emptiness, nothingness

I believe in Death
The dream will end tonight

Desert, Storms
Black Serpent from my dreams
Let me taste your poison
All dreams must end
