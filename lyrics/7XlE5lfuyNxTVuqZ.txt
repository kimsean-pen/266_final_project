when it's over, when it's done
we'll be older just because
you can break me down
break me down
break me down
winter's colder than I thought
but just to hold you is enough
I won't make a sound
make a sound
make a sound
in this pit
I feel sick
shine your boots boys this is it
don't you see
now we're free
we won't have to make believe
I'm not dying before I feel you again
I'm not dying before I feel you again
when it's over, when it's done
we'll have known it was enough
just to wait around
safe and sound
breaking down
you feel closer than I thought
the consolation of your touch
lord don't take me now
in this pit
I feel sick
shine your boots boys this is it
don't you see
now we're free
we won't have to make believe
I'm not dying before I feel you again
I'm not dying before I feel you again
I'm not dying before I feel you again
I'm not dying before I feel you again
