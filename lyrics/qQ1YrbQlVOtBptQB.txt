catch a boat to england, baby, maybe to spain,
wherever i have gone,
wherever i've been and gone,
wherever i have gone the blues run the game.

send out for whiskey, baby, send out for gin,
me and room service, honey,
me and room service, mama,
me and room service, we are living life of sin

when i'm not sleeping, honey, you are on my mind,
when i'm not sleeping, honey,
i ain't sleeping, mama,
when i ain't sleeping well you know you'll find me crying.

try another city, baby, another town,
wherever i have gone,
wherever i've been and gone,
wherever i have gone the blues come following round.

living is a gamble, baby,
loving's much the same,
wherever i have gone,
wherever i've rolled them dice,
wherever i have gone the blues are all the same.

when i'm not drinking baby, someplace down the line,
when i ain't drinking honey, i ain't drinking mama,
when i'm not drinking, well you know you'll find me crying

catch a boat to england, baby, maybe to spain,
wherever i have gone,
wherever i've been and gone,
wherever i have gone the blues run the game
