My tears are falling
'cos you've taken her away.
And though it really hurts me so,
there something that I got to say:

Take good care of my baby,
please don't ever make her blue.
Just tell her that you love her
make sure you're thinking of her
in everything you say and do.

Take good care of my baby,
now don't you ever make her cry.
Just let your love surround her,
paint rainbows all around her,
don't let her see the cloudy sky.

Once upon a time
that little girl was mine.
If I had been true
I know she'd never been with you.

So take good care of my baby,
be just as kind as you can be.
And if you should discover
that you don't really love her
just send my baby back home to me.

Take good care of my baby,
be just as kind as you can be.
And if you should discover
that you don't really love her
just send my baby back home to me.

Take good care of my baby,
take good care of my baby,
take good care of my baby.
