Love ridden, I've looked at you
With the focus I gave to my birthday candles
I've wished on the lidded blue flames...
Under your brow
And baby, I wished for you!

Nobody sees when you are lying in your bed
And I wanna...
Crawl in with you
But I cry instead

I want your warmth, but it will only make me colder
When it's over
So I can't tonight, baby!

No! Not "baby" anymore!
If I need you I'll just use your simple name
Only kisses on the cheek from now on
And in a little while, we'll only have to wave

My hand won't hold you down, no more!
The path is...
Clear to follow through
I stood too long in the way of the door!
And now, I'm giving up on...
You!

No! Not "baby" anymore!
If I need you I'll just use your simple name

Only kisses on the cheek from now on
And in a little while, we'll only have to wave

No! Not "baby" anymore!
If I need you I'll just use your simple name
Only kisses on the cheek from now on
And in a little while, I'll only have to wave
