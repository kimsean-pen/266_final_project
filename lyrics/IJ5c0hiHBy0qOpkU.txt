Bitch, I got some clout (eh, eh, eh)
Bitch, I got some clout (brrp)

All in my bag
All in my wrist
All of my shit (what)
Prank my dog for the vlog
Iced out rilla pawg
You busy tryna get fame
I'm busy countin' dis money (bands)
Callin' myself a comedian
But none of my shit even funny (hahaha)
I used to work for da coin (ay)
Now I ride clout wit' da boys (yuh)
Pretend to give money to bums (eh)
Now I got money for toys (eh)
Puffin' on purp for da snap
I run the 'rari and take it right back
Bitches be sleepin' wit' me
But they just be in it for tags
They just want this clout

Bitch, I got some clout (eh, eh, eh)
Bitch, I got some clout (brrp)
Bitch, I got some clout
Bitch, I got some

All I got is clout
Walk outside, watch 'em shout, bitch
Pull up to Supreme, drop some green
Ballin' out, bitch
Bought a wag, blow a bag
Bulldog, cost like 20 grand
Gucci tee, ripped jeans
That's just so my knees can breathe
Wake up in the Hills, I live in the Hills
Did I mention I live in the Hills?
Poppin' pills, no real skills
All the bitches be like "Come to Brazil!"
Clout got me this shirt, bitch, you know it ain't a knock-off
I could take a shit on camera, watch this shit pop off
Propose to my bitch, I'm obsessed with engagement
I'll write a fuckin' diss-track 'bout my mom, bitch, I'm shameless
Name my house after the clout, name my dick after the clout
I'm so poppin' you would think I'd think
of something else that fuckin' rhymes with

Clout
