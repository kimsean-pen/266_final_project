I don't wanna fight no more
I only wanna get to shore
Baby don't slam the door tonight
Ran another off the tracks
That's time we can't get back
We can save tomorrow if we try

Ohhhhh till we make this right
Ohhhhh I won't say goodnight

I just wanna make you laugh
I just wanna see that smile
Baby we're only here, oh, for a little while
I just wanna hold you till we fall asleep
I want love
I want us
I want you
I want me
I want peace

Yea everybody needs a place,
somewhere that's warm and safe
for shelter from this crazy world we're in
But tonight I let the rain inside
I took away your place to hide
I'm sorry if I made you cry again

Ohhhhh we can make this right
Ohhh kiss me good night

I just wanna make you laugh
I just wanna see that smile
Babe we're only here, oh, for a little while
I just wanna hold you till we fall asleep
I want love
I want us
I want you
I want me
I want peace

Yeah I want peace

Ohhhhh we don't have to fight
Ohhhh just kiss me all night

'Cause I want peace

I just wanna make you laugh
I just wanna see that smile
Baby we're only here, oh, for a little while
I just wanna hold you till you fall asleep
I want love
I want us
I want you
I want me
I want peace

I just wanna make you laugh
I just wanna see that smile
Baby we're only here, oh, for a little while
I just wanna hold you till you fall asleep
I want love
I want us
I want you
I want me
I want peace
I want love
I want us
I want you
I want me
I want peace
