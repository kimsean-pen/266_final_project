The flaming arrows are flying high
Illuminating the distant skies
My life is moving another way
Familiar motion, it brought me here today

The sky opens up across the night
Leaving us so small, pinpoints of light
All is forgiven, forgotten and sane
Through the sound of my voice, if not my name
The sound of my voice, if not my name

I'm hunching forward to my surprise
Tears welling upwards inside my eyes
I'm sure it's over, Apollo said
Another arrow straight for my head
And others are elated now I'm gone
The river Styx it didn't cover all
My heart was missed as well
Where'd I go wrong?
Calcaneus explodes and then we'll fall

The sky opens up across the night
Leaving us so small, pinpoints of light
All is forgiven, forgotten and sane
Through the sound of my voice, if not my name

The sky opens up across the night
(I'm not getting out alive this time)
Leaving us so small,
pinpoints of light (I'm not getting out alive this time)
All is forgiven,
forgotten and sane (I'm not getting out alive this time)
Through the sound of my voice, if not my name
The sound of my voice, if not my name
