I Can't wait for the weekend to begin

I'm working, all week long
I dream the days away
I wanna sing my song
So let the music play

I have to get my fix, and fly tonight
And when the clock strikes 6, on Fri-day Night
I need to blow it all away

I Can't wait for the weekend to begin ...

I make it what i can
I try, I try
I'm shakin' up my plan
And I feel fine

I'm saving all my soul and all my pain
So I can lose control on Sat-urday
I'm gonna blow it all away (blow, blow, blow, blow)

I can't wait for the weekend to begin ...

I got to get my fix, and fly tonight
And when the clock strikes 6 on Fri-day Night
I'm gonna blow it all away (blow, blow, blow, blow)

I can't wait for the weekend to begin ...
