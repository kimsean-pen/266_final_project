Where we going
I don't know if you're
Holding me back
You really put me through it
Yeah
I'm stuck in the middle
Hand on the trigger
I'm tempted a little, but
Could you open up
If you wanted to
Am I blinded by
The faith I put in you
Say you have to go
Then you overstay
I think I hate you but I just can't turn away

I can't remember the days
When you used to cherish my name
Don't be so dramatic
We're both melted plastic
And that's just the name of the game

Should I let you fall
Are you too far gone
Cause after all
I'm stuck in the middle
Hand on the trigger
I'm tempted a little but
Could you open up
If you wanted to
Am I blinded by
Those sexy things you do
Say you have to go
Then you overstay
I think I hate you but I just can't turn away

Stay awake for hours
Just to pass the days
On second thought
It's all I've got
It's making me behave

I can't remember the days
The look on your face hasn't changed
We've grown so damn toxic
There's no love we lost it
And that's how our story's explained

Should I let you fall
Are you too far gone
Cause after all
I'm stuck in the middle
Hand on the trigger
I'm tempted a little, but
Could you open up
If you wanted to
Am I blinded by
The faith I put in you
Say you have to go
Then you overstay
I think I hate you but I just can't turn away
