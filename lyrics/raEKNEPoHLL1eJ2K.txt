it start at the top
now it's spiralling down
works best when it's lost
diggin' under the ground

Never mind it now
we can bring it back
it's total trash
and it's a natural fact
that i'm not no cow

It's never the same
it's more than a game
can't take it away
can't kill all the shame

It's a guilty man
that increased the crack
it's total trash
sack 'em on the back
with a heavy rock

There he goes again
magic monkey friend
can i love the time
that he seems to spend
with all the kids in town

It start at the top
now it's spiralling down
works best when it's lost
diggin' under the ground
Never mind it now
we can bring it back
it's total trash
and it's a natural fact
that i'm not no cow
