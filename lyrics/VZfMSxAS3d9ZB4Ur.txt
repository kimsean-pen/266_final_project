I grew up all alone, my mom and dad fightin'
I moved around a lot, I did a lot of fightin'
I met my friend Ian, I seen a lot of cyphers
I did a lot of writin'âˆ’

Watch my uncles duck indictments
I'm used to ramen noodles, victims of mental illness
Products of neighborhoods with broken souls and wounded spirits
Don't judge me by appearance (I moved to California)
Started gettin' paid (Nigga, you broke,) shit's already borin'

Dashin' to the money like a hyphen
Fuck a pipe dream, man, had this shit when I was in my diapers
Burnin' through my diapers, hot shit
It was hot shit, back when niggas lookin' for the Loch Ness

Stuck 'round dip spittin' assholes, make they mamas bashful
Got holes in my pockets so my shoes full of cash though
Cigar, Fidel Castro, car full of Castrol
See the sunset when I backstroke, can't swim but I could act though

I was playin' rock paper scissors with imaginary friends
Imagine havin' no friends, ay
I was playin' rock paper scissors with imaginary friends, ay
Imagine havin' no friends, man
I was playin' rock paper scissors with imaginary friends
Imagine havin' no friends, man... ay, ay
Imagine havin' no friends, man
