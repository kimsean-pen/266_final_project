I've lived life drained, void of emotion
I've lived life drained
I will never become this again
I will rise over this

Smash through obstacles with a heart of gold and a mind of steel
Nothing will stand in my path
I've been consumed by my thoughts
I've become what I've always despised
The only way I can absolve myself is with your lies

Where my mind knows no bounds.
Never again
My mind has released itself from this anguish and I will overcome this suffering
I will be whole once again... I will be whole once again
And I will become the answers to my own prayers
And I won't let you bring me down
I will remain!
Nothing you say can take this heart away from me
