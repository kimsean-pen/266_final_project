So we got a little careless
And we broke our bones
I said "Johhny it's the last time"
In my last love note

And when I cracked your Rolex
You went and grabbed my throat
My baby, baby blue eyes
Looked so cold

We break all the dishes, I think there've been fifty
We say we just love the sex and keeping it risky

Ha, ha, ha
I come back every time
Ha, ha, ha
Now I'm out of my mind
Ha, ha, ha
I come back every time
Ha, ha, ha
Now I'm out of my mind
I said Johhny it's the last time
I said Johhny it's the last time

So we got a little careless
So we called they off
I get fixated
On the schemes and plots

I'll make you be the one begging
So I could call the shots
It's a power tactic
Daddy you had taught

We break all the dishes, I think there've been fifty
We say we just love the sex and keeping it risky

Ha, ha, ha
I come back every time
Ha, ha, ha
Now I'm out of my mind
Ha, ha, ha
I come back every time
Ha, ha, ha
Now I'm out of my mind
I said Johhny it's the last time
I said Johhny it's the last time
I said Johhny it's the last time
I said Johhny it's the last time

Ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha
I said
I said
I said Johhny it's the last time
