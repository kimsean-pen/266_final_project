Lately I've been missing you crazy
And when I need you the most
That's when I cry for your ghost

Tell me that we got our own shit
Mine's is mine nobody else's
Wish I could take back each cigarette
Bargain God for your birthdays
I hope that you're happy
You go ahead to make a place for us

Lately I've been missing you crazy
And when I need you the most
That's when I cry for your ghost

You are the library burned
But they can't take the lessons that I've learned
I heard it a hundred times, but I could never tell it right
Wish I could be by your side

Lately I've been missing you crazy
And when I need you the most
That's when I cry for your ghost

How is the view?
Can you feel it when we miss you?
The wind blew the hat from my head
Was it you? Was it you?
You always play too much
You still play too much
You make a place for us
And when I get there
I'll have to say so much
