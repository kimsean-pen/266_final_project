You look in my eyes and I get emotional inside. I know it's crazy but
you still can touch my heart. And after all this time you'd think that
I, I wouldn't feel the same but time melts into nothing and nothing's
changed.

I still believe someday you and me will find ourselves in love again. I
had a dream someday you and me will find ourselves in love again.

Each day of my life I'm filled with all the joy I could find. You know
that I am not the desparate type. If there's one spark of hope left in
my grasp I hold it with both hands. It's worth the risk of burning to
have a second chance. No, no no no no no I need you baby. I still
believe that we can be together (haaoo). If we believe that true love
never has to end. Then we must know that we will love again.

I still believe (yeeaaah) someday you and me will find ourselves in love
again. Oh baby yeah, I had a dream someday you and me will find
ourselves in love again. I still believe (oh baby
I do) some day you
and me (just give me one more try) in love again. I had a dream (I miss
your love) someday you and me will find ourselves in love again. I
still believe (yeah I still believe) someday you and me (baby) in love
again.
