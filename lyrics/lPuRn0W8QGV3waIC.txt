It's been too long since the last rain
Still the stars sizzle hot in the sky
And there undressed in the shadows
Stands my sweet Cherie hiding from July

And all night you kept me up
Up all night
Hoping that I could make you mine

You're gettin' me hot, Cherie
I want what you've got all over me
Isn't my love, strong enough
I'm ready to rock you long and rough
You're gettin' me hot, Cherie
I want what you've got all over me
I'm going crazy (yeah)

I can't wait, for October
When the breeze, from the lake, she's blowing cold
Well maybe she'll need me, for some shelter
When the campfire dies and the tall tales have been told (yeah)

And all night, I've been workin' overtime
Hoping that I could make you, mine

You're gettin' me hot, Cherie
I want what you've got all over me
Isn't my love, strong enough
I'm ready to rock you long and rough
You're gettin' me hot, Cherie
I want what you've got all over me
I'm going crazy

And all night, I've been workin' overtime
Hoping that I could make you, mine

You're gettin' me hot, Cherie
I want what you've got all over me
Isn't my love, strong enough
I'm ready to rock you long and rough
You're gettin' me hot, Cherie
I want what you've got all over me
Isn't my love, strong enough
I'm ready to rock you long and rough

You're gettin' me hot, Cherie
Cherie (Cherie ay, yeah)
You're gettin' me hot, Cherie (you're gettin' me hot baby, Cherie)
Isn't my love, strong enough
I'm ready to rock you long and rough
