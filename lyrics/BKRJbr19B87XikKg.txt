Trying hard to breathe
Head between my knees
Take my hand and squeeze
Say I'm all right

Whisper in my ear
Happy you are here
Everything seems clear
We're all right
We're all right

Tell me not to trip or to loose sight
You are walking in my dotted line
Take my hand and help me not to shake
Say I'm all right

I'm all right
Say I'm all right
I'm all right
It's okay to feel

Everything is real
Nothing left to steal
Cause we're all right
We're all right

Tell me not to trip or to lose sight
You are walking in my dotted line
Take my hand and help me not to shake
Say I'm all right

I'm all right
Say I'm all right
I'm all right
Say I'm all right
I'm all right
