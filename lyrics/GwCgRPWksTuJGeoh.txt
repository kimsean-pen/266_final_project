My hands are tied, my voice is still
My body wants to move
My eyes see beauty
I cannot reach it
Paradise lies here
Here in this aging heart of mine

I hunger to be seen I'm right here

My champion enlightened soul
Unchain the burden of all that I've become
My hero, I have lost so much
My angel call my name

Fighting demons
Torn between my love for darkness and the light
I seem to see the beauty
Oh guide me, lead me, shine for me

I hunger to be seen I'm right here

My champion enlightened soul
Unchain the burden of all that I've become
My hero I have lost so much
My angel call my name

Right here I'm safe, in my mind I am free
Right here I'm safe, in this moment I am free
I'll conquer this fear I'll rise

My champion enlightened soul
Unchain the burden of all that I've become
My hero I have lost so much
My angel hear me
Darkness wears a white dress
and wings of glass
