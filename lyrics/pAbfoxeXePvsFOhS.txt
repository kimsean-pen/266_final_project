You got me deep, just like they all said you would
Thought we were good, thought we were good
Until you put me down in front of a crowded room
I was stupid, thinking a leaf was turned
'Cause I got burned, yeah I got burned
I wear a scar in the place that you made the wound

'Cause you left me scored
I drew the five of swords, and now
I'm running, I'm running
I'm coming to bring you down

'Cause baby I'm a liar, I'm a bitch
And you and I have unfinished business
Narcissistic hypocrite
And I'm petty as hell but at least I admit it
Blow my phone up, say I'm crazy
I know what you've called me lately
It's time to burn the witch
It's time to burn the wi-i-i-i-itch

I called you out, but my critics all said I was wrong
It took a while, it took a while
But now they see what I've been saying all along
You took a match to the bridge I was trying to mend
What goes around, comes back around
If only you had been a nicer person

I'm a liar, I'm a bitch
And you and I have unfinished business
Narcissistic hypocrite
And I'm petty as hell but at least I admit it
Blow my phone up, say I'm crazy
I know what you've called me lately
It's time to burn the witch
It's time to burn the wi-i-i-i-itch

Roses are red, violets are blue
Lady Karma's a bitch and she's coming for you

Roses are red, violets are blue
Lady Karma's a bitch and she's coming for you

Roses are red, violets are blue
Lady Karma's a bitch and she's coming for you

Roses are red, violets are blue
Lady Karma's a bitch and she's coming for you

'Cause baby I'm a liar, I'm a bitch (liar)
And you and I have unfinished business
Narcissistic hypocrite (ah-hah)
And I'm petty as hell but at least I admit it (at least I admit it)
Blow my phone up, say I'm crazy
I know what you've called me lately
It's time to burn the witch (time to burn the witch)
It's time to burn the wi-i-i-i-itch

I'm a liar (ah-hah)
I'm a liar (ah-hah)
It's time to burn the wi-i-i-i-itch
'Cause baby, I'm a liar (ah-hah)
'Cause baby, I'm a liar (ah-hah)
It's time to burn the witch
(Liar, liar, liar, liar)
