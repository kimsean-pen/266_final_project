I never thought you'd be a junkie because heroin is so passe.
But today, If you think that I don't know about depression and emotional pain,
You're insane.
And you're a fool who hasn't paid attention to a word that I say.
In a way,
I can't help but feel responsible, I always knew that you were insane.
With your pain.
But I never thought you'd be a junkie because heroin is so passe.
Heroin is so passe.
Heroin is so passe.
So passe. Nowaday,
You never thought you'd get addicted, Just be cooler in an obvious way.
I could say,
Shouldn't you have got a couple piercings and decided maybe that you were gay.
In a way,
I can't help but feel responsible, I always knew that you were insane,
With your pain .
But I never thought you'd be a junkie because heroin is so passe.
Heroin is so passe.
Heroin is so passe. Ahh, ahh, ahh. Heroin is so passe.
Heroin is so passe. Heroin is so passe. Ahh, ahh, hey, hey.
