Here I go (higher, higher)
Here I go (higher, higher)
Here I go, go, go, go, go!

You gotta get me to the world on time
You gotta get me to the world on time

The minute you walk in the room
I break into a sweat
My hands begin to shake so bad
I can't light my cigarrette
Then you start walkin' towards me
And my cool comes all undone
If I could get my feet to move
I'd turn around and run

My pulse is beatin' faster
And I'm headin' for disaster

Here I go (higher, higher)
Here I go (higher, higher)
Here I go!

Get me to the world on time
You gotta get me to the world on time

One kiss from you
And my whole body starts to actin' strange
You shake up all my hormones,
You put me through a change
This chemical reaction isn't easy to refine
You drive me to distraction,
You disturb my peace of mind

You got me spinning like a top now
And I don't know how to stop now

Is this what loves all about
Lately I feel so without
Wild sensations
Sweet frustrations
You get me goin'
And theres no slowin' me down

Here I go!
Whoa here I go, go!
Whoa, Here I go, go, go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!
