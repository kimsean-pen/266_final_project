If loving you were a crime
I'd to the hardest time
You are perfection every time

You know it kills me
I can't always be right here
Cause right now you love me
Then you disappear

Wish I could always have you here with me
Wish I could hold you, never let you leave
Wish I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
Wish I could bottle you up
I wanna hear your voice inside of me
I drink you up and you're alive in me
And I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
Wish I could bottle you up

Bottle you up

Right now you're mine
But we're running out of ti-ay-ime
It's part of the rush it's taking me high

You know it kills me
We can't always be right here
Cause right now you love me
Then you disappear
(oh oh oh, ooh oh)

Wish I could always have you here with me
Wish I could hold you never let you leave
Wish I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
Wish I could bottle you up
I wanna hear your voice inside of me
I drink you up and you're alive in me
Then I can put it away, save it for a rainy day
Wish I could bottle you up

Bo-bottle you up
(Wish I could)
Bottle you up
(Wish I could)
Bottle you up
(Wish I could)
Bottle you up
(I wish I could)
Bottle you up
Bo-Bottle you up
(Wish I could)
Bottle you up
Bo-Bottle you up

(I wish I could)
Bottle You up (Up!)
(Wish I could)
Bottle you (Up!)
Bottle you up
(Wish I could)
Bottle you up!

(Bottle you up)
Oh oh
(Bo-Bottle you up)
Yeaaah

Wish I could always have you here with me
(here with me)
Wish I could hold you never let you leave
(let you leave)
Wish I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
Wish I could bottle you up
I wanna hear your voice inside of me
I drink you up and you're alive in me
Then I can put it away, save it for a rainy day
Wish I could bottle you up

Bo-bottle you up
(Wish I could)
Bottle you up
(Wish I could)
Bottle you up
(Wish I could)
Bottle you up
(I wish I could)
Bottle you up
Bo-Bottle you up
(Wish I could)
Bottle you up
Bo-Bottle you up

And I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
Wish I could bottle you up

Bottle you up
