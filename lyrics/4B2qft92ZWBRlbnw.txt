Calling out for the lonely, I am going home
I've been doing awful things again
I hear them laughing in my head
I went out in the morning looking for a man
I could see you were the perfect one
Standing all alone.

I've been walking ahead for a while
And dragging a body behind
My baby, I had a good time
My baby, I know you won't mind.

Got them all collected in these boxes
Underneath my bed, my bed.

Here I am still lonely with the souvenirs
I would kill for some company
Temporarily
I did once have a lover, only kept his hands
They can dance and play the songs for me
Play until I sleep.

I've been walking ahead for a while
And dragging a body behind
My baby, I had a good time.

Got them all collected in these boxes
Underneath my bed, my bed.

Got them all collected in these boxes
Underneath my bed, my bed.

Got them all collected in these boxes
Underneath my bed, my bed.
