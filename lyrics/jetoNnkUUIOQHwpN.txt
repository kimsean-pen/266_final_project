If you say we're falling
It's gonna be on our feet
We're gonna take you to town
We'll ride the dark side of the street

If you think we're not fighting
Like we used to do
So are you ready for this, you might learn a bit
A trick or two

'Cause all those years of rockin' hard
Have taught us how to rise
And how to fall
We're standing tall

We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
I said we're gonna go out with a bang
Ba-ba-bang, bang, bang
Out with a bang, yeah

If you say we're losing
Watch out, we're taking the crown
Thumbs go up all the way
No sign of slowing down

If you think we're excited
I cannot tell you how much
'Cause life's a heartbeat away
And we're never losing touch

'Cause all those years of rockin' hard
Have taught us how to rise
And how to fall
We're standing tall

We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
I said we're gonna go out with a bang
Ba-ba-bang, bang, bang
Out with a bang
Bang, bang, bang
We're going out with a bang
Ba-ba-bang, bang, bang
Out with a bang

'Cause all those years of rockin' hard
Have taught us how to rise
And how to fall
We're standing tall

I said we're gonna go out with a bang
Bang, bang, bang
Out with a bang
Bang, bang, bang
We're going out with a bang
Ba-ba-bang, bang, bang
Going out with a bang, bang, bang
Oh, bang
