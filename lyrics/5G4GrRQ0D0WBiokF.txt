Here I go again
Down that road again
I haven't solved it yet
What happened if we never met? Oh oh
If I'd just ignored
Those sliding doors
If I'd turned instead from your bed?

Am I queen?
Or something else I might have been?
A star?
Backseat of a blacked out car
Is that me or someone else entirely?

And do I ever find love?
Do I ever find love?
Do I ever find love?
Or am I still waiting?

In the midst of sleep
Pictures come to me
Memories and dreams
Things lost that might have been
If you'd broke my heart
Very near the start
Do I sink alone like a stone?

Am I queen?
A magisterial has been
I'm on fire
A head full of desire
This is me
I'm someone else entirely

And do I ever find love?
Do I ever find love?
Do I ever find love?
Or am I still waiting?
Or am I still waiting?

Am I queen?
Or something else I might have been?
A star?
Propping up the backstage bar
Is that me or someone else entirely?

And do I ever find love?
Do I ever find love?
Do I ever find love?
Or am I still waiting?
Or am I still waiting?

Am I queen?
Or something else I might have been?
A star?
Backseat of a blacked out car
Is that me?

Or am I still waiting?
Or am I still waiting?
Or am I still waiting?
Am I still waiting?
Or am I still waiting?
