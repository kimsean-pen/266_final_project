(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Spending time
Convinced that it's mine with her
Just to keep her out of mind

Still I'll take care to see
Which way the wind blows
Notice how her hair curls

Pay no mind to the clown
Who sits to your side
Content to yield, despite pride

He is a fool to assume, you'd spare a thought
I'm a thief who's just been caught
I don't find it funny anymore

And so I won't play the part I played before, oh no
Not to you

Mmm, I don't see you laughing anyway
And so I won't play a part in your mistake, no way
Not unless you stay

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
