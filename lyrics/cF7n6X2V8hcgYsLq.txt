Suddenly seeming
These eggshell rifts
Caving into your hands
Can't sustain this breathing
It weighs on my chest
These lungs are filled with water from the tide
From the tide
And I watch them go by

Can't define a purpose
Though hands set adrift
In eyelids, cobwebs forming
Realize through the vapor
Some strange trembling gift
In sleep, I dream of houses in the sky
In the sky
And I watch them go by

Sometimes I'm pulled away
From my own misery
Your hands cover me
Eyes drift slowly

Sleep the summer chill
In sheets of linen
Hush the static sound
Of time dispersing

Sometimes I'm pulled away
From my own misery
Your hands cover me
Eyes drift slowly

Sleep the summer chill
In sheets of linen
Hush the static sound
Of time dispersing
