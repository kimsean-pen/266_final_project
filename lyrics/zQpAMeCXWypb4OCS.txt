Oh, Madonna, Madonna

I don't miss you just who you used to be
and you don't ring true so please stop calling me
Your "I love you"'s are ten a penny
You're dropping clues like you've got any
You got to choose
There's been so many ohhhh

I love you baby
but face it she's Madonna
No man on earth
could say that he don't want her
This look of love
says I'm leaving
you're frozen now
I've done the freezing
I'm walking out
Madonna's calling me

She's got to be obscene to be believed
That's her routine not what she means to me
I found myself by circumstance
across a room where people dance
And quite by chance
she' danced right next me

I love you baby
but face it she's Madonna
No man on earth
would say that he don't want her
It's me not you
I've got to move on
You're younger too
but she's got her groove on
I'm sorry love
Madonna's calling me

I want to tell you a secret

We're having drinks
with Kate and Stella
Gwyneth's here
she's brought her fella
But all I wanna do
is take Madonna home

I love you baby
but face it she's Madonna
No man on earth
would say that he don't want her
It's me not you
I've got to move on
You're younger too
but she's got her groove on
I'm sorry love
Madonna's calling me
