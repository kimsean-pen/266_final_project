Would you pray if I said you were dying?
Would you be a little stronger or fall down on your knees?
Would you stay with me if you knew that I was lying?
Would you walk away or turn the other cheek?

I tremble where I stand
My wish is your command
The nature of a truly desperate heart
Give me something real
That I can truly feel
(Liar, liar)
On the wall

Whisper, whisper in the dark
Tell me what you see
Poisoned by your fly-infested poetry (poetry)
Liar, liar on the wall
Give the world to me
A wasteland or a monarchy?
(Liar, liar)
Tell me what you see

Now I'm here and my pain is my companion
Now I know it wasn't meant to heal
The cut is way too deep
No more wasted years of sacrificial bleeding
I'm the master of the war inside me

But still, I tremble where I stand
My wish is your command
The yearning of an undiscovered soul
Give me something real
So I can truly feel
(Liar, liar)
On the wall

Whisper, whisper in the dark
Tell me what you see
Poisoned by your fly-infested poetry (poetry)
Liar, liar on the wall
Give the world to me
A wasteland or a monarchy?
(Liar, liar)
Tell me what you see

I shine when the sun is down
And carry this heavy crown
I won't compromise
Release me
(Whisper, whisper in the dark
Tell them what we're looking for
Make us see the truth
Liar, liar on the wall!)

Whisper, whisper in the dark
Tell me what you see
Poisoned by your fly-infested poetry
Liar, liar on the wall
Give the world to me
A wasteland or a monarchy?
Liar, tell me what you see!

Whisper, whisper in the dark
Tell me what you see
Poisoned by your fly-infested poetry (poetry)
Liar, liar on the wall
Give the world to me
A wasteland or a monarchy?
(Liar, liar)
Tell me what you see
