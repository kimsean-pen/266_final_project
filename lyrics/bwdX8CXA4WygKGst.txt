She calls me from the cold
Just when I was low
Feeling short of stable
All that she intends
And all she keeps inside
Isn't on the label

She says she's ashamed
Can she take me for a while?
Can I be a friend?
We'll forget the past
Or maybe I'm not able
And I break at the bend

We're here and now
Will we ever be again?
'Cause I have found
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
Away again

She dreams a champagne dream
Strawberry surprise
Pink linen on white paper
Lavender and cream
Fields of butterflies
Reality escapes her

She says that love
Is for fools that fall behind
And I'm somewhere between
I never really know
A killer from a savior
'Til I break at the bend

We're here and now
Will we ever be again?
'Cause I have found
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
Away again

It's too far away for me to hold
Too far away
It's too far away for me to hold
Too far away
Ah-ow

Yeah, it's too far away for me to hold
Too far away, ah-ow
It's too far away for me to hold
Too far away
It's too far away for me to hold
Too far away, ah-ow
It's too far away for me to hold
Too far away
Guess I'll let it go
