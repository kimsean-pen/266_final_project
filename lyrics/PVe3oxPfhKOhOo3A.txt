Something I learned today
Black and white is always grey
Looking through the window pane
I'm not inside your brain

Something I learned today
Yield to the right-of-way
Stopping at a four-way sign
Someone else's rules, not mine

Something I learned today
Never look straight in the sun's rays
Letting all the sunshine in
Can't remember where I've been
