You walk in and act so surprised
Even though every Friday night I'm here
You know I'm here

You talk to some girl
I dance with some guy
Catch each other's eye and we pretend
Like we don't care

But I know you know I know
We ain't really lettin' things go, no

You leave here and you drive home
You take a turn down my road
I watch you through my window and hide so you can't see
Don't you know I want you with me
And it ain't just cause I'm tipsy
You can act like it's all over
And you don't miss me
Or you could just kiss me

Kiss me, kiss me, yeah

We talked and talked and talked some more
Over thought this thing right out the door
Well I don't wanna talk no more

Who we kidding?
Why we pretending?
Wish you'd just go on and lean in now
What are you waiting for?

So either tell me I'm insane
Or let's call off these crazy games

You leave here and you drive home
You take a turn down my road
I watch you through my window and hide so you can't see
Don't you know I want you with me
And it ain't just cause I'm tipsy
You can act like it's all over
And you don't miss me
Or you could just kiss me

Kiss me like the first time
Leave your lips on mine
I can't remember why
We ever said goodbye

You leave here and you drive home
But baby I know where you wanna go
You leave here and you drive home
You take a turn down my road
I watch you through my window and hide so you can't see
Don't you know I want you with me
And it ain't just cause I'm tipsy
You can act like it's all over
And you don't miss me
Or you could just kiss me
You could just kiss me
You could just kiss me
