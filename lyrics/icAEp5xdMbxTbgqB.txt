Stay out of the light
Or the photograph that I gave you
You could say a prayer if you need to
But just get in line and I'll grieve you
Can I meet you alone?
Another night and I'll see you
Oh, another night and I'll be you
Some other way to continue
To hide my face
Another knife in my hands

A stain that never comes off the sheets
Clean me off
I'm so dirty, babe
The kind of dirty where the water never cleans off the clothes
I keep a book of the names and those
Only go so far
'Til you bury them
So deep and down we go
Touched by angels though

I fall out of grace
I did it all so maybe
I'd live this every day
Another knife in my hands

A stain that never comes off the sheets
Clean me off
I'm so dirty, babe
It ain't the money and it's sure as hell ain't just for the fame
It's for the bodies I claim and lose
Only go so far
'Til you bury them
So deep and down we go
Down
And down we go
And down we go
And down we go
And we all fall down
I tried

I tried
And we'll all dance alone to the tune of your death

We'll love again
We'll laugh again
And it's better off this way
And never again

And never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead now
Well, never again

And never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head and we're all dead now
I tried
One more night

One more night
Well I'm laughing out, crying out, laugh out!
I tried
Well I tried
Well I tried
'Cause I tried
But I lied
I lied
I tried
I tried
I tried
And we'll love again

We'll laugh again.
We'll cry again and we'll dance again
And it's better off this way
So much better off this way
I can't clean the blood off the sheets in my bed
Well, never again
And never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead now
