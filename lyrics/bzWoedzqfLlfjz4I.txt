Are you ready? It's time for war
We'll break down these fucking doors
Smash the windows, tear down the walls
We won't stop 'till it's all destroyed
Let it out, just let it show!
We'll burn it down, and we'll lose control
Set the fires, can you feel the heat?
Tonight we're alive, there's no time to sleep

Woah!
Riot!
Woah!
Riot!
Woah!

Here comes the sirens, here comes the law
Woah!
Run from the sirens, run from the law
Woah!
Round two, are you feeling alive?
We'll overcome, we'll fucking survive
Smashing the boundaries, breaking the law
We can't stop 'till it's all destroyed
Let it out, just let it go!
We'll burn it down, and we'll lose control
Set the fires, can you feel the heat?
Tonight we're alive, there's no time to sleep

Woah!
Riot!
Woah!
Riot!
Woah!

Here comes the sirens, here comes the law
Woah!
Run from the sirens, run from the law
Woah!
It's time to tear it all!

Riot!
Woah!
Riot!
Woah!
Here comes the sirens, here comes the law
Woah!
Run from the sirens, run from the law
Woah!
Woah!
RIOT!
