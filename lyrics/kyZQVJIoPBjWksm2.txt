She's my girl
When the sun goes down
When the moon comes up
When the light is off

She's my friend
When I need a friend
When I want her love... I can have it

Oooh! We've got everything we need (we need)
We share everything we have
We have sadness and happiness... Oh! Darling

Oooh! We cry and laugh everytime (everytime)
We love all the love we feel
And we feel all the love we make

She's my girl
When the sun goes down
When the moon comes up
When the light is off

She's my woman
When I need a woman
When my body is asking...
We can love

Oooh! We've got everything we need (we need)
We share everything we have
We have sadness and happiness... Oh! Darling

Oooh! We cry and laugh everytime (everytime)
We love all the love we feel
And we feel all the love we make
