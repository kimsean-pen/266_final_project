I was angry and brash as a bull,
You were devastatingly beautiful
I was crude,
I was lewd,
I was not in the mood
It's a peculiar stance,
It's me reachin' for the olive branch...

Yes I will do all the things that you ask of me,
Yes I will,
Come on darling,
Have no fear,
Though the way is dark,
And hands will grab at us,
I'll remember this.
And only this,
Yes I will

Tear jerker,
Shadow lurker,
Wonder worker,
Reach a bit further

Will you by any chance, remember the olive branch...?

Yes I will do all the things that you ask of me,
Yes I will,
Come on darling,
Have no fear,
Though the way is dark,
And hands will grab at us,
I'll remember this.
And only this,
Yes I will

Tear jerker,
Shadow lurker,
Wonder worker,
Reach a bit further

Will you by any chance...?
Yes I will
