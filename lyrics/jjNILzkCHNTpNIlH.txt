Throw your heart to me
Let it fall and hit the ground
Let it go, oh-oh-oh
Your timing was so wrong
And I just want to be found

And, oh...
And I, yeah, I've got the lines
I've got the lines
Oh, it's brighter this time
And this type of mine
This disguise
Oh, you talk, ooh, to me

Well, nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut
I can see through them
I can see through them
And I am drawing pictures, I'm evading
I will not use them
I will not use them again

And it starts again
You come over with your friends
I don't wanna talk to them
And all I really want is to start again

And, oh...
And I, yeah, I've got the lines
I've got the lines
Oh, it's brighter this time
And this type of mine
This disguise
Oh, you talk, ooh, to me

Well, nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut
I can see through them
I can see through them
And I am drawing pictures, I'm evading
I will not use them
I will not use them

'Cause I want to be bigger then life
Hurt you, hurt you
'Cause I want to be bigger then life
Hurt you, hurt you

And nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut
I can see through them
I can see through them
And I am drawing pictures, I'm evading
I will not use them
I will not use them

No, nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut
I can see through them
I can see through them
