A worthless existence

I'm drowning
In the river
As the water fills my lungs
Wondering am I the bastard son?

Living diseases
Just pick up the pieces
So hopeless
Your god is sick of excuses

So sick of excuses

A worthless existence
Pathetic and distant
The blood is cleaner
But vision is weaker
The devils dying
And I am the answer

Time is precious
And it will fade away
One day you'll know how it is to feel useless
So hateful, cos I'm so sick of excuses
So sick of excuses

A worthless existence
Pathetic and distant
The blood is cleaner
But vision is weaker
The devils dying
And I am the answer

And I am the answer
A living disaster
A project of torture
Forgotten, unanswered
And I am the answer
A living disaster
A project of torture
Forgotten, unanswered

And I am the answer
A living disaster
A project of torture
Forgotten, unanswered
