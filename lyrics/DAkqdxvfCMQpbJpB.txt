You and I
Felt so good to begin with didn't we?
Now it seems there's far too many
adverts in between
And we don't speak
So we're left in constant silence
It's haunting me
So I'm ready now to fight this

You have the shield
I'll take the sword
I no longer love you
No longer love you
I'm not afraid of danger in the dark
I no longer love you
No longer love you

You and I aren't working
Burning on the bridges now
We're trapped inside
Screaming won't somebody get
me out

I no longer love you
no longer love you And we don't speak
So we're left in constant silence
And it's haunting me
So I'm ready now to fight this
