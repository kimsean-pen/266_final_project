Hey you
Look what you do to me
You bend and you bruise me
While you try to control me

But you don't own me
How come you just wanna hurt me
How come you just wanna push me
I can't ignore you anymore
'Cause everywhere I turn you
You burn me, you break me
You always wanna take me

Down with you
What do you want from me
I don't wanna be afraid
I don't wanna run away

I don't wanna be here fading
It's more than I can take
I'm never gonna be the same

I threw it all away
I don't wanna be here fading
Just let go

(Look what you do to me)
Let go
(Look what you do to me)
Hey you
Look what you do to me
You hurt and you scar me
With all that you tell me

But I'm not listening
You love me
You hate me
You always want to take me

Down with you
What do you want from me
(I won't stay)
I don't wanna be afraid

I don't wanna run away
I don't wanna be here fading
It's more than I can take
I'm never gonna be the same

I threw it all away
I don't wanna be here fading
Just let
You keep pushing me

You keep using me
You keep twisting me
You keep breaking me
You can't have me anymore

You can't have me anymore
You can't have me anymore
You can't have me
Let go

I don't wanna be afraid
I don't wanna run away
I don't wanna be here fading
It's more than I can take
I don't wanna be afraid
I don't wanna run away
I don't wanna be here fading
It's more than I can take
I'm never gonna be the same
I threw it all away
I don't wanna be here fading
Just let go
Let go
Just let go (Holding on)
Let go (Holding on)
Just let go
Let go
Let go
