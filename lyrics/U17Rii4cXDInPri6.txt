But I know I wanna take you, leave you alone, ayy
Hmmm, hello?

I don't really know where I'm tryna go
But I know I wanna take you, yeah
When I'm on the road and I leave you alone
I'm just pray I don't break you, yeah
I was on the phone within the other room
Not trying to wake you, yeah
When I'm on my own I'll be sipping Patr√≤n
And I'll be trying to blame you, yeah

Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me
I know that you don't (I know that you don't)
Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know, girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me
I know that you don't (I know that you don't)

I would give it all back for you right now
I can never forget you
Run away from me
Try to run away but I ain't gonna let you
And I can hear my heartbeat
Sounding like the bass drop
I said baby don't stall with the fucking
And the make-ups, nah
I'ma take the long way home
Gotta couple hundred missed calls on my phone

Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me
I know that you don't (I know that you don't)
Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me
I know that you don't (I know that you don't)

But when you tell me that you love me
I put trust in you, don't judge me
I'm just going through some shit right now
And I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down
No, I just wanna leave this town
Sometimes I feel like everyone hates me

Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me
I know that you don't (I know that you don't)
Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me
I know that you don't
