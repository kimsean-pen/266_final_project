Sometimes I can't get up
To face the day
Some folks just wont let up
And keep bothering me.

I live by my own rules which may bother some
Just because I'm not like you doesn't mean that I'm dumb
I'd rather just set a fire and be left alone.

I'm a miserable failure
That's what I'm told
Miserable failure
Much too old
I'm a Miserable failure
I don't know why
Miserable failure until I die.

Sometimes I can't get up
To face the day
Some folks just wont let up
And keep bothering me.

I'm a miserable failure
That's what I'm told
Miserable failure
Much too old.
