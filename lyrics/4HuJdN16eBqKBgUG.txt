It's time to be this, it's time to be that
Let me just become the sword between you and I
Inflexible and sharp, I will impose you my pace
Don't talk, don't talk weak, and stay at your place
It has something to do with suffering
And fear / The enemy
Oppose the weight of your resentment to these words
And you will see
Guess What? Samurai Spirit

Against your own fear / Samurai Spirit
Against your mind torments / Samurai Spirit
Against life attacks / Samurai Spirit
Against brain harassment / Samurai Spirit

The heart of the trouble, cement of the mind
This is my best weapon between you and I
Legacy of hate, reign of snakes
I must ward off this mad dance, making no mistakes
Find the target, forget the goal

(I've) got go search my inner self / Break the wall
Within reach of my sword they are already dead
My hardships allows me to chop off their heads
Guess What? Samurai Spirit

Against your own fear / Samurai Spirit
Against your mind torments / Samurai Spirit
Against life attacks / Samurai Spirit
Against brain harassment / Samurai Spirit

Takezo's path
The orphan's Revenge, nature protect me
Mind is my friend and my body a tree
They try to avenge, one school against me
Life is a weapon for who wants to "be"

Guess What? Samurai Spirit

Against your own fear / Samurai Spirit
Against your mind torments / Samurai Spirit
Against life attacks / Samurai Spirit
Against brain harassment / Samurai Spirit
