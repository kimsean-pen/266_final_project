Woah, woah
I've been fighting the same Old war
Against a disease without a cure
Been holding on for so long
For so long, for so long
I've been wishing upon a star
As my universe falls apart
I feel so far from the sky
As my dreams are flying by
And they say it's a battle that can't be won
We need our knives, we need our guns
Should I run away
And change my name
Or should I
Stay and fight
Through the night
And never close my eyes
I'll never close my eyes
I've come too far to go back now
To turn into a face in the crowd
Been on this road for so long
For so long, for so long
Convinced there is no way out
My world is turning upside down
My sense of direction's been gone
For so long, for so long
And they say it's a battle that can't be won
We need our knives, we need our guns
Should I run away
And change my name
Or should I
Stay and fight
Through the night
And never close my eyes
I'll never close my eyes
Stay strong
Keep moving
Can't let the darkness blind us
Carry on
We'll be the ones
That pull the stars down to us
Stay strong
Keep moving
Can't let the darkness blind us
Carry on
We'll be the ones
That pull the stars down to us
Should I run away
And change my name
Or should I
Stay and fight
Through the night
And never close my eyes
I'll never close my eyes
I'll never close my eyes
