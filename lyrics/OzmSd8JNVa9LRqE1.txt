Before I fall too fast
Kiss me quick
But make it last
So I can see how badly this will hurt me
When you say goodbye

Keep it sweet
Keep it slow
Let the future pass
And don't let go
But tonight I could fall too soon
Under this beautiful moonlight

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep

And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
But please don't catch me

See this heart
Won't settle down
Like a child running
Scared from a clown

I'm terrified of what you do
My stomach screams
Just when I look at you

Run far away
So I can breathe
Even though you're far from suffocating me
I can't set my hopes too high
'Cause every hello ends with a goodbye

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this's unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
But please don't catch me

So now you see
Why I'm scared
I can't open up my heart without a care
But here I go
It's what I feel
And for the first time in my life I know it's real

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this's unravelling
Your love is where I'm falling
So please don't catch me

If this is love please don't break me
I'm giving up
So just catch me
