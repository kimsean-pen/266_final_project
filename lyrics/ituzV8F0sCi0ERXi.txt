Summer wind blows in again
Sometimes I wonder where we lost it
My good intentions—your favorite weapons
And still I've yet to learn my lesson
Who-oah

No, I don't need much of anything
Just a shady tree and a couple pulls of whiskey
To write my songs of love and life and loss
And just a few bout you
So if you'll hear me out

Stay with me, we don't never have to leave
You my southern king, we live it for the daydreams
So don't you laugh—Notre Dame he had his chance
And he's a good, good man
But there's some things he just don't understand
So when my old man's out of town but a couple days
I think that you should stay
Oh, won't you stay
Hmmmm

So come on down, I'll show you how
Us midwest boys like to party
So grab a beer... And get over here
Summer's drawin near
Don't waste another year... hey, hey, hey!

Stay with me, we don't never have to leave
You my southern king, we live it for the daydreams
So don't get mad—what's past is in the past
And we can make this last
if you just give me that chance
So when my old man's out of town but a couple days
I think that you should...

Stay with me
all summer
Stay with me
under the covers
Stay with me
Be my lover

Walkin through that old gate
It's quite a site to see
That handsome face in this desert place
Getting away from me
That's juxtaposition
But right now it's indecision
Do I go back out
and chase you down?
Or will you be the one that got away?
No, no, no

Stay with me, we don't never have to leave
You my southern king, we live it for the daydreams
So don't get mad—what's past is in the past
And we can make this last
if you just give me that chance
So when my old man's out of town but a couple days
I think that you should...

Stay with me
all summer
Stay with me
under the covers
Stay with me
Be my lover

Stay with me
all summer
Stay with me
under the covers
Stay with me
Be my lover
