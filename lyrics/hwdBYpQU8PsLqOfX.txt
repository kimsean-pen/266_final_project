There was a time when I could breathe my life into you
And one by one your pale fingers started to move
And I touched your face and all life was erased
You smiled like an angel fallen from grace

We've been slaves to this love from the moment we touched
And keep begging for more of this resurrection
We've been slaves to this love from the moment we touched
And keep begging for more of this resurrection

And you kissed my lips and with those once cold fingertips
You reached out for me and oh, how you missed
You touched my face and all life was erased
You smiled like an angel fallen from grace

We've been slaves to this love from the moment we touched
And keep begging for more of this resurrection
We've been slaves to this love from the moment we touched
And keep begging for more of this resurrection

This resurrection
Of this resurrection
Of this resurrection
Fallen from grace

We've been slaves to this love from the moment we touched
And keep begging for more of this resurrection
We've been slaves to this love from the moment we touched
And keep begging for more of this resurrection
Of this resurrection, my darling
This resurrection
This resurrection
