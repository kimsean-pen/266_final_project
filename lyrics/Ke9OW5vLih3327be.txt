I wanna live in a city with no friends or family
I'm gonna look out the window of my color TV
I wanna remember to remember to forget you forgot me
I'm gonna look out the window of my color TV

Through the cracks in the wall, slow motion for all
Dripped out of the bars, someone smart said nothing at all
I'm watching TV, I guess that's a solution
They gave me a receipt that said I didn't buy nothing

So rust is a fire and our blood oxidizes
My eyes rolled around, all around on the carpet
Hit the deck, it's the decal man
Standing upside down and talking out of his pants

I wanna live in a city with no friends or family
I'm gonna look out the window of my color TV
I wanna remember to remember to forget you forgot me
I'm gonna look out the window of my color TV

Through the cracks in the wall, slow motion for all
Dripped out of the bars, someone smart said nothing at all
I'm watching TV, I guess that's a solution
They gave me a receipt that said I didn't buy nothing

So rust is a fire and our blood oxidizes
My eyes rolled around, all around on the carpet
Hit the deck, it's the decal man
Standing upside down and talking out of his pants

Through the cracks in the wall, slow motion for all
Left holding the ball and a part for your car

I don't know, but I been told
I don't know, but I been told
You never die if you'll never grow old
