Take my soul
Take my pride away
Bury me deep into an early grave

Tied down to the floor
Writing from anxiety
Tired of trying and anxiously searching for doors
To a golden existence
We'll breathe in the hate and exhale greatness
Judgement is a shell and we can break it

Give life purpose

Take my soul
Take my pride away
Bury me deep into an early grave

Shattering bones
Inside your feet
We're all wandering
Searching for meaning
Endlessly
We're all wanderers

Sleep resets
Start again
Dig deeper create a canyon and
Force the elevation to descend
Gather strength
Throw your voice into the clouds
The rain will kill the fire
Flames will fear the sound

Can it be broken
Can it be forged together
Are you proud of the words you've spoken?
These words are yours forever

Take my soul
Take my pride away
Bury me deep into an early grave
I don't wanna go on this way
When the truth is a lie
It's a lie
