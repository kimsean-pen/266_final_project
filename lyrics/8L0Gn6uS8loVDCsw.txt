I don't wanna be bad
I don't wanna be good
And you misunderstood
I'm leanin' your way again
I've got some plans
And I've got no doubts
And we will be better than we used to be now
Across the room
You're whipping your hair and you're tappin' those shoes
I've got you
You come and you go
I'm in the bedroom with this girl
She's not like you
If you stick around with me
That everything's fine
We'll be okay
I don't mean to be hard on you
I just wanna feel somethin' new
Feel it too
You come and you go
I'm in the bedroom with this girl
She's not like you
If you stick around with me
That everything's fine
We'll be okay
You got me feelin' alright
You got me feelin' alright
You got me feelin' alright
You got me feelin' alright
You got me feelin' alright
You got me feelin' alright
