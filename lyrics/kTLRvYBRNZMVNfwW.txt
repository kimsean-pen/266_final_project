What's that love?
What's that sound
That's my love dying for you
Who is there
Screaming out
That's my love
That's my love
That's my love
That's my love

Oh, I'm at the end of my rope
Oh, hanging here
I feel sick
Oh, my heart is feeling heavy with hope
And I might be losing my grip

Over, no this can't be done
Rewind before the credits run
Closer, on the tip of my tongue
Fell in love with no parachute on
Over, no this can't be done
Rewind before the credits run
Closer, as the waterfall comes
Fell in love with no parachute on

What's that love?
What's that sound
That's my love dying for you
Fell in love with no parachute on
Who is there
Screaming out
That's my love
Fell in love with no parachute

We pushed, we pulled like a sumo
Skinny dipped and kissed on the pool floor
Too busy fucking in [?], go on
Now the only thing we bang are closed doors
Banging closed doors
We're on a bad trip
But I'll never admit
That I'm losing my grip

Over, no this can't be done
Rewind before the credits run
Closer, on the tip of my tongue
Fell in love with no parachute on
Over, no this can't be done
Rewind before the credits run
Closer, as the waterfall comes
Fell in love with no parachute
Fell in love with no parachute on
Fell in love with no parachute

What's that love?
What's that sound
That's my love dying for you
Fell in love with no parachute
Who is there
Screaming out
That's my love
Fell in love with no parachute on

Mumbling to, mumbling to, mumbling to myself
It can't end like this
Tell me it ain't gonna end like this
Tell me it ain't

Over, no this can't be done
Rewind before the credits run
Closer, on the tip of my tongue
Fell in love with no parachute on
Over, no this can't be done
Rewind before the credits run
Closer, as the waterfall comes
Fell in love with no parachute on
Fell in love with no parachute on
Fell in love with no parachute
