In the shame of youth stood the lion's ghost
Black eyed and smiling ignorant and innocent
It was my first taste of death
A violent sour loss and the guilt is eating me alive
My memories of you are worth more than god
A string not broken by the indifferent hands of fate
But by my fucking need
For never ending pain
I should be dead not you
