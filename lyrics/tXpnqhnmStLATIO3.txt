Falling, falling
For the diamonds at night
Falling, falling
For the diamonds at night

No, no, no
If it gets old
For the candles in the black, stories told
Walk outta the bar
in silent, slow
Grippen your hand,
it's cold

Falling, falling
For the diamonds at night
Falling, falling
For the diamonds at night

Have you lived yet, been older
Not right now, but it'll be over
Tough right now, but ill stay closer
Please stay closer
Back away
Snow outside
Skies is falling
Paris walking

Falling, falling
For the diamonds at night
Falling, falling
For the diamonds at night
