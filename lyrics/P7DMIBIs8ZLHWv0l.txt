It's been a while since I've reached for that wedding dress
The one I always liked to wear, a girl's just gotta look her best
It's a timeless classic, basic cut
Some things just stay in style
Perfect for that special day and it looks so good going down the aisle
I'm ushered in, I take my place on the bride's side of the church

And it fits me like a glove, holds me just tight enough
It's nothing new, but it still turns heads
My little black wedding dress
My little black wedding dress

It's been dry-cleaned for tears of joy and a champagne toast or two
Posed for pictures and never missed a dance with the best man and the groom
The organ starts, no wedding march
We stand and spin around

And it fits me like a glove, holds me just tight enough
It's nothing new, but it still turns heads
My little black wedding dress
My little black wedding dress

Wish I'd never bought it as I'm hanging it in the closet
What I wouldn't give tonight to trade it in for one that's white

And fits me like a glove, holds me just tight enough
But until then, it's just me, I guess
And my little black wedding dress
My little black wedding dress
