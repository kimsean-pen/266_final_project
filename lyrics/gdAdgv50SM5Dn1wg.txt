I've gone out too far
May not make it back
How can I get through
If you cringe at the sight
And if I had something you wanted
You would stay
That's just the horrifying way I see it

Shame
Screaming like a whale from the love I've failed
Dreaming of a way but you know my hands are tied
Falling to the floor in a restless state
Picking at my skin cause you know I can't be saved

I may lose myself
So you will be fine
And if I had something you wanted
You would stay
That's just the horrifying way I see it

If you really mean it
If you really mean it
You never have to go
That's all I want

Burning like a candle at both its ends
Shining really bright but the warmth won't last the night
Falling to the floor in a restless state
Picking at my skin cause you know I can't be saved

You say you wanted more
I know you wanted more
Doesn't mean a thing
Mean a thing to me
You said that you would change
Everything's the same
It takes too much for me
It takes everything

Shame
Screaming like a whale from the love I've failed
Dreaming of a way but you know my hands are tied
Burning like a candle at both its ends
Shining really bright but the warmth won't last the night
