Don't call me, leave me alone
Not gonna answer my phone
'Cause I don't
No I won't see you
I'm out to have a good time
To get you off of my mind
'Cause I don't
And I won't need you (oohh, oohh)

Send out a 911 (oohh, oohh)
We're gonna have some fun (oohh, oohh)
Hey, boy, you know you better run

'Cause it's a girl's night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out and play out
Without you
You better hold tight
This girl's night is without you (oohh, oohh)

Let's go, G.N.O (oohh, oohh)
Let's go, G.N.O (oohh, oohh)
Let's go, G.N.O
Let's go
It's a girl's night

I'll dance with somebody new
Won't have to think about you
And who knows what lettin' go will lead to (oohh, oohh)

You'll here from everyone (oohh, oohh)
You'll get the 411 (oohh, oohh)
Hey, boy, you knew this day would come

'Cause, it's a girl's night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out and play out
Without you (oohh, oohh)

Let's go, G.N.O (oohh, oohh)
Let's go, G.N.O (oohh, oohh)
Let's go, G.N.O
Let's go

Hey, boy
Don't you wish you could've been a good boy?
Try to find another girl like me boy
Feel me when I tell you I am fine
And it's time for me to draw the line

I say, hey boy
Don't you wish you could've been a good boy?
Try to find another girl like me boy
Feel me when I tell you I am fine
And it's time for me to draw the line
(The line, the line, the line)

'Cause it's a girl's night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out and play out
Without you
You better hold tight
This girl's night is without you (oohh, oohh)

Let's go, G.N.O (oohh, oohh)
Let's go, G.N.O (oohh, oohh)
Let's go, G.N.O
Let's go
It's a girl's night

(Oohh, oohh)

(Oohh, oohh)
(Oohh, oohh)
