Hello
There goes the gal in the pretty skirt
With the golden smile that made you feel new
Like when the marching band strolls the street
You know another year's come too soon
So you took her hand and she gave a look
That sent you to the moon
And there you spoke the words of a gentleman
Can I have this dance with you?

Can I share this dance with you?
Won't you come on home?
I built us a flying machine
And we'll go where you want

And we'll sail the seven seas
I hope all is well in Daisy's dreams
There goes the gal
Yeah, the pretty bird, on the golden mile
That made you feel real
She took with on to the stars
She don't make no big deal
And there she sits with them big old fields

Of daisies and rusty mills
And when the sun, it shines on her hair of gold
She's beautiful, she's beautiful
Won't you come on home?
I built us a flying machine
And we'll go where you want
We'll sail the seven seas
I hope all is well in Daisy's dreams
In Daisy's dreams
