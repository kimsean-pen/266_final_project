Like a fool, I call you on a Saturday
Nothing better to do than try and explain
I guess it's only fair to say
You wore me out to show your age
And there we were just standing thing
Dark light falling down within

I couldn't lie for the first time
I didn't know that I'd never mind
I hit above, now it feels right
Take it home and wait, all night

I think about every hurt bit
I wouldn't lie if I'm missing it
I think I might if I give in
Everything has changed, alright

Pull me back before you get in front of me
Things have moved enough for you to disagree
So sit aside and watch me try
To leave us all alone in time
When you're wrong then I can't hear
Your feelings when you're least revered

I couldn't lie for the first time
I didn't know that I'd never mind
I hit above, now it feels right
Take it home and wait, all night

I think about every hurt bit
I wouldn't lie if I'm missing it
I think I might if I give in
Everything has changed, alright

I couldn't lie for the first time
I didn't know that I'd never mind
I hit above, now it feels right
Take it home and wait, all night

I think about every hurt bit
I wouldn't lie if I'm missing it
I think I might if I give in
Everything has changed, alright
