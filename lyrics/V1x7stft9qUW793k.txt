Here we go again
Pack your bags and leave all caution to the wind
I've got a bad feeling that the roads you take
Will take longer than we planned

We used to drive all night on the 319
Singing songs with our friends that you threw away
You know, you dropped the bomb that killed the night

If I were you, I'd cancel every plan that I've made today
And drive as far away
To a place where no one knows my name

It's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely
Here's the place I'm at now
At least you made me better with my goodbyes
Consider it a lesson to learn how to get through
Feeling hopeless for the first time

We used to drive all night on the 319
Singing songs with our friends that you threw away
You know, you dropped the bomb that killed the night
But we made it out alive

If I were you, I'd cancel every plan that I've made today
And drive as far away to a place where no one knows my name
If I were you, I'd take back everything I once claimed to be
I'd sing old songs that we used to sing

It's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely
Lonely, lonely
It's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely
Lonely, lonely
It's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely

We used to drive all night on the 319
Singing songs with our friends that you threw away

We used to drive all night on the 319
Singing songs with our friends that you threw away
You know, you dropped the bomb that killed the night
But we made it out alive

If I were you, I'd cancel every plan that I've made today
And drive as far away to a place where no one knows my name
If I were you, I'd take back everything I once claimed to be
I'd sing old songs that we used to sing

It's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely
Lonely, lonely
It's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely
Lonely, lonely
It's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely
Lonely, lonely
It's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely
Lonely, lonely
It's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely
