I know it seems alright
To just wait till the feelings right
But I can see it in your eyes
A shade of blue and a signal fire
You like the glow of the downtown lights
The colours on the street when it rains all night
But I can't give you what you want
If you don't want it from me baby

It's a deep burn blue
(Burning right through you)
It's a deep burn blue
(Burning right through you)
It's a deep blue burning right through you

I know that people talk
Shake their heads at the way you walk
On the street, in the park
You say it's cause we're the same in the dark
You like the sound of a pink moon cry
Lying on the floor as the day goes by
But time alone means nothing
If you can't escape the hurt you're feeling

It's a deep burn blue
(Burning right through you)
It's a deep burn blue
(Burning right through you)
It's a deep blue burning right through you

It's a deep burn blue
(Burning right through you)
It's a deep burn blue
(Burning right through you)
It's a deep blue burning right through you
(Burning right through you)

And it burns right through you

It's a deep burn blue
(Burning right through you)
It's a deep burn blue
(Burning right through you)
It's a deep blue burning right through you
(Burning right through you)

It's a deep burn blue
(Burning right through you)
It's a deep burn blue
(Burning right through you)
It's a deep blue burning right through you
Burning right through you
(Burning right through you)
(Burning right through you)
(Burning right through you)
