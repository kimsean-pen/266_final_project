in the blizzard of '77
the cars were just lumps on the snow
and then later
tripping in 7-11
the shelves were stretching out of control
on a plane ride
the more it shakes
the more i have to let go
now the signals
still getting all mixed up
we're always doing damage control
but in the middle of the night i worry
it's blurry even without light
i know i have got a negative edge
that's why i sharpen all the others a lot
it's like flowers or ladybugs
pretty weeds or red beetles with dots
(repeat)
i miss you more than i knew
