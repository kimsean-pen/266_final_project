If I had nothing to my name
But photographs of you
Rescued from the flames
That is all I would ever need
As long as I can read
What's written on your face
The strength that shines
Behind your eyes
The hope and light
That will never die

And one promise you made
One promise that always remains
No matter the price
A promise to survive
Persevere and thrive
As we've always done

And you said
"The poison in a kiss
Is the lie upon the lips"
Truer words were never shared
When I feel
Like lies are all I hear
I pull my memories near
The one thing they can't take

And one promise you made
One promise that always remains
No matter the price
A promise to survive
Persevere and thrive
As we've always done.

The books still open
On the table
The bells still ringing
In the air
The dreams still clinging
To the pillow
The songs still singing
In a prayer.

Now my soul
Is stretching through the roots
To memories of you
Back through time and space
To carry home
The faces and the names
And photographs of you
Rescued from the flames

And one promise you made
One promise that always remains
No matter the price
A promise to survive
Persevere and thrive
And dare to rise once more
A promise to survive
Persevere and thrive
And fill the world with life
As we've always done
