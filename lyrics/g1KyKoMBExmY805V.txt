In the genesis of the world
Just the arctic wind was blowing
Something came into paradise,
The everlasting snow melted away

Arctica!
You start to think there is something greater than
Humankind.
Arctica!
The world is crying and the streams are telling how
Things went wrong.

Sorrow and worry of humankind
Sas stories to find.
The world is growing ice again
- covering the faults of the human race!

Arctica!
You start to think there is something greater than
Humankind.
Arctica!
The world is crying and the streams are telling how
Things went wrong.
