I've noticed, people, they all have motives
Different, yet all the same
I fumble through every word that is spoken
And I barely knew your name
I'm tongue-tied, it runs through my blood and my insides
Some things we can't escape
But if we try, if we try, we can leave this behind

It's been a lifetime, a lifetime we waited for
A simple question, kid, "Are you with me or not at all?"

Your eyes wide, always ahead of the curve type
Quiet and confident
Oh, we stood there, awkward and youthful, we tangled
A piece of my soul escaped
Oh, we are restless and tired of sleeping with giants
A modern mankind with their egos of fire

And it seems like it's been a lifetime, a lifetime we've waited for
A simple question, kid, "Are you with me or not at all?"

Are we wasting time or is it wasting us?
It's been a lifetime waiting for now, now
Well, you've got to find a way
You've got to find a way, you've got to find a way
You've got to find a way, you've got to find a way
Before you fold

It's been a lifetime, a lifetime I waited for
A simple question, kid, "Are you with me or not at all?"

It's been a lifetime, a lifetime we waited for
I need an answer, kid
You're either with me or not at all, no, no
Are we wasting time or is it wasting us?
It's been a lifetime, a lifetime, a lifetime, lifetime, yeah

Well, you've got to find a way
You've got to find a way, you've got to find a way
You've got to find a way, son, you've got to find a way
You've got to find a way, you've got to find a way
Before you fold in
