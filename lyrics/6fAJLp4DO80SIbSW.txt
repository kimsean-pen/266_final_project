How many lies must I become
To get to a place off the track?
In our pursuit of number one
Everybody's racing harder for the pass
(You were the one)

Cos she was the girl that I used to be
A girl with no responsibility
Became the armour that I hid behind
... You like what you see?

Why are you so scared of falling?
(Hold your head up high)
Why do you hold on? Stop mourning
(Rise and redefine)
When you begin to feel it
You know what to do
So go and find it
This is your alterlife

Don't stop for any red blue light
The moment will fade underneath
Keep on the road and don't lose sight
Everybody's waiting for you to arrive
(You were the one)

Cos she was the girl that I used to be
A girl with no responsibilities
Breaking the armour that I hid behind
I'm not what you see

Why are you so scared of falling?
(Hold your head up high)
Why do you hold on? Stop mourning
(Rise and redefine)
When you begin to feel it
You know what to do
So go and find it
This is your alterlife

You are who you are
All of the pain and pleasure is you
(You were the one)
Although life is hard
Deep in the centre unshaken stands true

This is my
(Alterlife, alterlife, alterlife)
You know what to do
(Alterlife, alterlife, alterlife)

Why are you so scared of falling?
(Hold your head up high)
Why do you hold on? Stop mourning
(Rise and redefine)
And all this time been tryin
Looking in the wrong place at the wrong time
(And now you're done)
The girl inside is healing
You know what to do now that you've found it
Live in your alterlife!
