It ain't your right
It ain't your right

It ain't your right, but thats okay
I'll let you slide this one time
I'll let you slide this one time

If you consider sleeping over, I'll consider you
I'll only warn you one time, I've got a stilted view
And if the problem child is gone now, I'll consider you
You're a lucky person
You're a lucky person

It ain't your right, but that's okay
I'll let you slide this one time
It ain't your right but that's okay
I'll let you slide this one time

I was so happy before, when I was alone with you
You showed me all my weakness
You showed me all my weakness
Now I'm the lonely boy again
You want to sleep it over
We'll see about that won't we
We'll see about that won't we

It ain't your right, but that's okay
I'll let you slide this one time
It ain't your right but that's okay
I'll let you slide this one time

It ain't your right
It ain't your right
