The long lost winter acceptance woes
A lasting slumber a sickness flows
The last of summer the longing rivers froze
A grasping hunger as darkness grows

Feeling so alive in this hopeless dream
Feeling so alive in this hopeless dream

We're the ones who pay, with honour
Your pain rejected, your holy symbols inane
Your honour remains infected again

The frost of winter, acceptance shows
A grasping hunger as fever grows
At last the summer the longing rivers flow
A lasting thunder, as darkness grows

Feeling so alive in this hopeless dream
Feeling so alive in this hopeless dream

We're the ones who pay, with honour
A malediction, your holy symbols inane
Will honour remains rejected again
