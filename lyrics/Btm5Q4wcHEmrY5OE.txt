Sitting on your stoop all afternoon
In the pouring rain, but we don't move
Clothes are stickin' to my skin
I'll be sick all the weekend
It's too hard to be inside a room
I'd rather be sitting next to you
Drinking beer out of the bag
Watching cars and yellow cabs, oh, I

I don't know what else I would do, oh,
Whoa, ooh
Than be sittin' right next to you, oh

Let's go on the roof and talk some shit
We can see the city if we squint
I hate when you smoke cigarettes
You hate when I mention it
Everyone on the roof is in
Bathing suits but there's nowhere to swim
Tryin' to get a little tan
'Cause they never leave this town, oh, I

I don't know what else I would do, oh, whoa, ooh
Than be sittin' right next to you, oh, ooh
I don't know what else I would do, oh, whoa, ooh
Than be sittin' right next to you, oh, ooh

You're always gonna be
Everything to me
Everything to me, everything to me
Everything to me
You're always gonna be
Everything to me
Everything to me, everything to me
You're everything to me

I don't know what else I would do, oh, whoa, ooh
Than be sittin' right next to you, oh, ooh
(You're everything to me)
I don't know what else I would do, oh, whoa
Than be sittin' right next to you, oh, ooh
