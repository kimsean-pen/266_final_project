Well, we're back in school again, and I don't really know anyone.
I really want to be your friend 'cause I don't really know anyone.
And the bus is pulling up to your house,
I wish you could be sitting here next to me.

I didn't see you at summer school, but I saw you at the corner store,
And I don't want to break the rules 'cause I've broken them all before.
But every time I see you,
I wonder why I don't break a couple rules so that you'll notice me.

Sister, do you know my name?
I've heard it before but I wanna know.

I got a funny feeling that it's gonna work out,
Cause now I see you sitting here next to me.
