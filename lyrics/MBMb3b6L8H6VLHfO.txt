In broken picture frames
The photographs remain
A woman and a figure
I don't recognize the face
His smile appears unbroken
But today you'll never know
The consequence that comes from
Hating who you love

No, don't try to save me
Wait for me to save myself

I say "You don't know her like I do
She's different when we're home"
But bruises only heal in flesh
The hurt is never gone
You should mind your own
I know I've got to go
But the fear she built inside my head
Now calls my heart its home

No, don't try to save me
Wait for me to save myself
Don't try to save me
Wait for me to save myself
But when

Don't try to save me
Wait for me to save myself
Don't try to save me
Wait for me to save myself
