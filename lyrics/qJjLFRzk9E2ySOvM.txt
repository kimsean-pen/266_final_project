Will you walk me to the edge again
Shaking
Lonely
And I am drinking again
Woke up tonight and no one's here with me
I'm giving in to you

Take me under
I'm giving in to you
I'm dying tonight
I'm giving in to you
Watch me crumble
I'm giving in to you
I'm crying tonight
I'm giving in to you

Caught up in life
Losing all my friends
Family has tried to heal all my addictions
Tragic it seems to be alone again
I'm giving in to you

Take me under
I'm giving in to you
I'm dying tonight
I'm giving in to you
Watch me crumble
I'm giving in to you
I'm crying tonight
I'm giving in to you

I look forward to dying tonight
Drink 'till I'm myself
Life's harder every day
The stress has got me
I'm giving in
Giving in
Now

Take me under
I'm killing all the pain
I'm dying tonight
I'm sick of all that faith
Watch me crumble
I'm killing all the pain
I'm crying tonight
I'm giving in to you

Take me under
I'm giving in to you
I'm dying tonight
I'm giving in to you
Take me under
I'm giving in to you
I'm crying tonight
I'm giving in to you
