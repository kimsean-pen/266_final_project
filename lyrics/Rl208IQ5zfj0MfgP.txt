Baby I'll just take a chainsaw to the sofa
Where I held your body close for so long, so long

Walk in the house, lights are off
In the closet by the door, there's your coat
I wasn't thinking of you before

Too many rooms in this house and we keep going out
What the hell is that about?
We gotta find a way to be okay

Baby I'll just take a chainsaw to the sofa
Where I held your body close for so long, so long
I'm gonna break the fuckin' China
Cause it's just one more reminder you're gone, you're gone

When I get home, TV on
Drink in my glass, better make it strong
Some nights wanna fill this place
With a tight dress and a pretty face

You find faith but you left on purpose
You had a plan, your timing's perfect
We gotta find a way to be okay

Baby I'll just take a chainsaw to the sofa
Where I held your body close for so long, so long
I'm gonna break the fuckin' China
Cause it's just one more reminder you're gone, you're gone

We were building brick by brick
Now it's just a quicksand home, yeah
So I'll take a chainsaw to the sofa
Where I held your body close for so long, so long
Ooh

I can put a sign in the lawn
But it would mean I would wanna let you go
And I don't wanna let you go

I can put a sign on the lawn
But it would mean I would wanna let you go
And I don't wanna let you go
I'll just take a chainsaw to the sofa
Where I held your body close for so long, so long
I'll burn everything that binds us
Take a lighter to the mattress you're on
We were building brick by brick
Now it's just a quicksand home, yeah
I'll take a chainsaw to the sofa
Where I held your body close for so long, so long
Yeah, so long
