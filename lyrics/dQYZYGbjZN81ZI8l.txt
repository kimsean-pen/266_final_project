There was a time when we were living getting lost in life
the things we'd ridicule
to what we'd glorify
from every prison, every passion, every terror, every dream
to all the turbulence and termoils on which we'd feed
but then the burden of your beauty and your innocence
tempted you away till we had nothing left

why did you choke all my love away?
did you choke all my love away?
why did you throw it all, throw it all away in the end

You played it like you wanted something more from me
when you were just a girl and everything to me
when we were staring through the blackness from the bleakness of it all
and now i look at you and realize that i've moved on

why did you choke all my love away?
did you choke all my love away?
why did you throw it all, throw it all away again

why did you choke all my love away?
did you choke all my love away?
why did you throw it all, throw it all away in the end

why did you choke all my love away?
did you choke all my love away?
why did you throw it all, throw it all away again
