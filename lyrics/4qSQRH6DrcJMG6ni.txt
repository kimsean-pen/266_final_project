This liquid vision of euphoria
Living a life on borrowed time
Paying the price of immortality
Desperately avoiding our fate
Lead me through the halls of tortured souls
Alone, forlorn... human dignity dethroned
Forevermore - A life never ending
Time stands still as the Immortals keep on breeding

The future is locked within us
All we need is the key
Crying at the fountain of youth
Eternal life is killing me!

Triumphant in chariots they ride
On this arena of the undead
Anoher lap of honour for the...
Vacant galleries
Lead me through the halls of tortured souls
Alone, forlorn... human dignity dethroned
Forevermore - A life never ending
Time stands still as the Immortals keep on breeding

The future is locked within us
All we need is the key
Crying at the fountain of youth
Eternal life is killing me!

The future is locked within us
All we need is the key
Crying at the fountain of youth
Eternal life is killing me!
