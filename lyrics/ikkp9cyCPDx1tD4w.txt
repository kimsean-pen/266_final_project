Got on my skateboard
And began to
Push away
From my house
Went with the wind
The day was dim
And I was sure
It was comin' from the south
Had a jacket
In my backpack
I threw it on
'Cause it was pouring cold
Caught a glimpse
Of the setting sun
The day's now gone
And I'm feelin' low

I guess I'm not getting any younger
Life flashes by just while we wonder
I guess I'm not getting any younger, younger
No'one said you'd roll forever
