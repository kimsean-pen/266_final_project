Why did we say
What you doing this for?
Baby never too late
To go back to before

You're feeling so bad
What you doing it for?
You're wishing you had
Your second chance and more

Baby it's getting late
Lying here in bed
Maybe I oughta wait up
But I fall asleeep instead

What happened to the days when
We'd stay awake all night long
To talk then try to find our Milky Way

Keep on giving it up
Up too late to stop ourselves from falling
Do you wonder how we ever kept it real?

You're hanging it up
But to try to stop I keep on calling
So take down your wall and tell me how it feels

Why did we say
What you doing this for?
Baby never too late
To go back to before

You're feeling so bad
What you doing it for?
You're wishing you had
Your second chance and more

Baby let's take a walk
Back where we began
Maybe then we can talk about the roses in your hand

I watched you from the window
Make your escape
Your sorry eyes have let go now but baby you're too late

Gonna bet you bet you never
You never question why I let you let you know
Did I mention mention you never give enough attention

Gonna bet you bet you never
You never question why I let you let you know
Did I mention mention you never give enough attention

Why did we say
What you doing this for?
Baby never too late
To go back to before

You're feeling so bad
What you doing it for?
You're wishing you had
Your second chance and more

Gonna bet you bet you never
You never question why I let you let you know
Did I mention mention you never give enough attention

Gonna bet you bet you never
You never question why I let you let you know
Did I mention mention you never give enough attention

Why did we say
What you doing this for?
Baby never too late
To go back to before

You're feeling so bad
What you doing it for?
You're wishing you had
Your second chance and more

Why did we say
What you doing this for?
Baby never too late
To go back to before

You're feeling so bad
What you doing it for?
You're wishing you had
Your second chance and more

The rivers of time
Are calling out for your mind
Baby you knew, oh, you knew

They're saying what's mine is yours
I think we're losing the war
I'm gonna keep on fighting for you
