They say that falling in love is wonderful
So wonderful, so they say
The thing that's known as romance is wonderful
So wonderful, so they tell me
I can't recall who said it, I know I never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand and
If there's a moon up above, it's wonderful
Wonderful in every way, so they say
You leave your house one morning
And without any warning
You find shoutin' that love is grand
To hold your girl in your arms is wonderful
Wonderful in every way, so they say
