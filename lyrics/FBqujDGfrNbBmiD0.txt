Must be fate's colossal strokes
colouring more
colouring more
shades into the swarm of senses,
breach the surface
foam and waves
can't wait to
hold you.

Let me swim for
burning circles.
Be my
Sunken temple,
fathoms under.

Be my
Be my
error. Must be fate's colossal strokes
colouring more
colouring more
shades of wild and sweet resurgence,
breach the surface
foam and waves
can't wait to
hold you.

Let me swim for
burning circles.
Be my
Sunken temple,
fathoms under.

Be my
Be my
error.
