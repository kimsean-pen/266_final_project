The scale wasn't even, I counted to three when
Measuring us
And I believed them, your words without meaning
They didn't light up
Maybe I turned to blind eye, just stay on the bright side
The windows are shut
But I see the light now, it's all out my life now
Taking the cut

Nothing, but a cloud of dust that I'm leaving far behind me
It's nothing, but a ring of smoke that's building up around me
I scatter it out like powder, powder
I scatter it out like powder, powder
Before I let the hurtful words you said get any louder
I just scatter it out like powder

You wanted to break me, wanted to flake me
Pick me apart
And you tried to hurt me, with words that could burn me
And leave me with scars
But when I let the past go, I see the stars glow
So I choose the light
Yeah, I'll take the high road, you know I will go
That extra mile

Nothing, but a cloud of dust that I'm leaving far behind me
It's nothing, but a ring of smoke that's building up around me
I scatter it out like powder, powder
I scatter it out like powder, powder
Before I let the hurtful words you said get any louder
I just scatter it out like powder (powder)

Powder
When I let the past go, I see the stars glow
So I choose the light
Yeah, I'll take the high road, you know I will go
That extra mile

Nothing, but a cloud of dust that I'm leaving far behind me
It's nothing, but a ring of smoke that's building up around me
I scatter it out like powder, powder
I scatter it out like powder, powder
Before I let the hurtful words you said get any louder
I just scatter it out like powder, powder
Like powder, yeah
I just scatter it out like powder
