Traffic crawls, cell phone calls, talk video screams at me
Through my tinted window I see a little girl, rust red minivan
She's got chocolate on her face, got little hands
And she waves at me, yeah, she smiles at me

Well, hello world, how you been?
Good to see you, my old friend
Sometimes I feel cold as steel
Broken like I'm never gonna heal
I see a light, a little hope in the little girl
Well, hello world

Every day I drive by a little white church
It's got these little white crosses like angels in the yard
Maybe I should stop on in and say a prayer
Maybe talk to God like He is there
Oh, I know He's there, yeah, I know He's there

Well, hello world, how you been?
Good to see you, my old friend
Sometimes I feel as cold as steel
And broken like I'm never gonna heal
I see a light, a little grace, a little faith unfurl
Well, hello world

Sometimes I forget what living's for
And I hear my life through my front door
And I'll breath it in, oh, I'm home again
I see my wife, little boy, little girl
Hello world, hello world

All the empty disappears
I remember why I'm here
Just surrender and believe
I fall down on my knees
Oh hello world,
Hello world, hello world
