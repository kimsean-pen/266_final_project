If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning

Look outside your window, there's a woman being grabbed
They're loaded with their weapons in a bible in their hand
Maybe we should go inside and try to stop the pain
The anthem started playing and I'd hate to miss the game
Sweating in the ghetto with the panthers and the poor
There reach will too we all for you but help you of the floor
With they hope become a riot and the dreamers and the rocks
But they've got [?] the penis and per since to get the cops

If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning

[?] turn tinkle you [?] to make a sale
They all so plastic [?] you comes to a fail
Maybe we could help the [?] distract your lie
[?] Playboy, yeah, new Sunday New York Times

If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
No we don't need another warning
If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning

I'll see you when the wall falls

If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
No we don't need another warning
If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
