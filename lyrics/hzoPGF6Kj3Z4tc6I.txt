Let's go and have some fun
On the beach
Where there's a party
Everyone will be there
On the beach
Where there's a party

We're gonna have a ball
Dancing and singing and winding and all

Holding hands together and laughing and all
Then we'll dance, dance, dance, daaaance...

One more box of hops
Says the man to the bartender
One more box of hops
Says the man, I won't surrender
