Waking up at the crack of noon
Reminiscing of the times I'm waking up with you
I should leave, sell my shit, make some kind of moves
I'm lying to myself, I never leave this fucking room
I gotta pile of shit I haven't addressed, head is a mess
Check the 'scrip bottles, see if any are left
There's nothing,nowhere. but let's not even go there
I'm lucky if I wake up, let alone care

'Cause there's a fine line from who I am and who I wanna be
I'm amazed at what I find when I look within honestly
Honestly, it feels like I'm waiting to die
Watch the days pass by, what's it mean to be alive?
And I've been killing time, going to bed with the sunrise
I got this feeling I won't make it to25
It's a far cry, know we all got hard times
But these long nights got me feeling like I wanna die

Leave my body by the liquor store
I'm an asshole, let me die slow
It's too late for me, can't you fucking see?
I dug my own grave, let me fucking be
Leave my body by the liquor store
I'm an asshole, let me die slow
It's too late for me, can't you fucking see?
I dug my own grave, let me fucking be

Don't even try to feed me all that "life is what you make it"
Pull up to your 9-to-5 and smile or try to fake it
But when you're in your bed alone I know you fucking face it
One day you'll meet your maker and you'll see your life was wasted
The reaper creeping slow, I know you see him when you dreaming
You posted at a party but he's in the dark scheming
And you keep telling me that life has some sort of meaning
So sorry if I'm pessimistic but I don't believe it

I'm a fuck up, motherfucker
I'm sick of tryna find myself in others
I'm sick of seeking love, I'd rather suffer
I'm sick of life, I put that on my mother
Yeah, I'm a fuck up, motherfucker
I needed you, you left me in the gutter
The saddest part is that I really loved her
On a sinking ship, I wave as I go under

Leave my body by the liquor store
I'm an asshole, let me die slow
It's too late for me, can't you fucking see
I dug my own grave, let me fucking be
Leave my body by the liquor store
I'm an asshole, let me die slow
It's too late for me, can't you fucking see
I dug my own grave, let me fucking be

I'm a fuck up, motherfucker
I'm sick of tryna find myself in others
I'm sick of seeking love, I'd rather suffer
I'm sick of life, I put that on my mother
Yeah, I'm a fuck up, motherfucker
I needed you, you left me in the gutter
The saddest part is that I really loved her
On a sinking ship, I wave as I go under
