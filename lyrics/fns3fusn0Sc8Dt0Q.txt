You're a nice guy
And you're looking for a nice girl to fall for you, for a lifetime
But that's not my vibe, I'm just tryna have fun
You say love is blind, but that's just some bullshit right there
'Cause I'm looking in your eyes, and they're burning fire
Sex on my mind, and that's what you want

Here face to face, and we both know the truth
You're calling my bluff, I can't lie like you do

Wish I could tell you that I love you but I can't
Wish I could call you in the morning but I can't (oh oh)
Wish I could tell you that I miss you but I can't (yeah)
This is not a love song
I get excited when you kiss me like that (like that)
When we're body to body like that (oh oh)
Wish I could tell you that I want you more than that
But this is not a love song

Sentimental guy, one of kind
Really boy, that's hard to find
But that's not my type, you should find your other side
The apple to your eye, the yin to your yang
The blue to your sky, your kiss in the rain
The Mary to your Jane
But you should know that's not my thing

Here face to face, and we both know the truth
You're calling my bluff, I can't lie like you do

Wish I could tell you that I love you but I can't
Wish I could call you in the morning but I can't (oh oh)
Wish I could tell you that I miss you but I can't (yeah)
This is not a love song
I get excited when you kiss me like that (like that)
When we're body to body like that (oh oh)
Wish I could tell you that I want you more than that (more than that)
But this is not a love song

This is not a love song
It's all lies, it's all lies
Fairytale's a waste of time
It's all lies, it's all lies (yeah)
You know what I want, you know what I like
No need to pretend we'll be happy in the end
No more lies, no more lies
This is not

Wish I could tell you that I love you but I can't
Wish I could call you in the morning but I can't (oh oh)
Wish I could tell you that I miss you but I can't (yeah)
This is not a love song
I get excited when you kiss me like that (like that)
When we're body to body like that (oh oh)
Wish I could tell you that I want you more than that (more than that)
But this is not a love song

It's all lies, it's all lies
Fairytale's a waste of time
It's all lies, it's all lies
This is not a love song
You know what I want, you know what I like
No need to pretend we'll be happy in the end
No more lies, no more lies
