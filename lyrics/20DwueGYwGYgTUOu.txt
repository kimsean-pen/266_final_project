Came to the city with an empty hand
She took me to the beach writing in the sand
Lies of green and white chamomile
She's making me sing and making me feel

This is just the beginning
(Wide awake at dawn)
This is just a start
(In the sun on downwind)
This is just the beginning
(Wide awake at dawn)
This is just a start
(In the sun on downwind)

Came down flying on a jumbo jet
We shared a coffee and a cigarette
Came from tour and I slept for days
We stayed up all night this this must be the place

This is just the beginning
(Wide awake at dawn)
This is just a start
(In the sun on downwind)
This is just the beginning
(Wide awake at dawn)
This is just a start
(In the sun on downwind)

This is just the beginning
This is just a start

This is just the beginning
(Wide awake at dawn)
This is just a start
(In the sun on downwind)
This is just the beginning
(Wide awake at dawn)
This is just a start
(In the sun on downwind)

Should to shoulder up in the air
So much air
All the way now, got nothing to lose
Only everything...
