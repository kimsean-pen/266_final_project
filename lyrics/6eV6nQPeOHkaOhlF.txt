How can I be sure
That our love
Is always what it seems to be
What it means to me

How can I be sure
That goodbye
Is only for a little while
'til I see you smile

I used to think our love
Was reason 'nough to stay
That was all before
And now the miles between us
Longer every day
How could I be sure

Twisted love affair
Torn apart
Caught between my love for you
And what I need to do

How could I move on
When my heart
Is beggin' for another chance
For renewed romance

From town to lonely town,
I'm reachin' for the day
I give you so much more
But would the diamonds make
The teardrops go away
How could I be sure

When the doctors can't prescribe
What our love, it will imbibe
Only then, will we know sobriety
When others care for lives
That some people set aside
Only then, will we know society
How can I be sure?
How can I be sure?
How can I be sure?
How can I be sure?
How can I?
How can I?
How can I be sure?
