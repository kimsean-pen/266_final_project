In total absence of light we meet again
Equal in strength, my nemesis, my only friend
Abysmal oceans roar with immortal hate
Imbued with blistering rage you will ride the wave

Fight until you
Die by the blade of the one you hate
End of reason, end of the game
Die by the blade of the one you love to hate
With all your heart

Eviscerated soul, maimed sanity
All sacrificed to the eclipsed reality
The abhorrent beast has revealed it's ugly face
You can smash all the mirrors
But there's only one true escape

Fight until you
Die by the blade of the one you hate
End of reason, end of the game
Die by the blade of the one you love to hate
With all your heart

Fight until you
Die by the blade of the one you hate
End of reason, end of the game
Die by the blade of the one you love to hate
With all your heart

Fight until you
Die by the blade of the one you hate
End of reason, end of the game
Die by the blade of the one you love to hate
With all your heart

Spill the vengeful blood
Screaming in the dark
