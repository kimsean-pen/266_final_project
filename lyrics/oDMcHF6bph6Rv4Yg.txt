Got my heart made up on you
You said what you said
When words are knives it's hard
Not to forget (to forget)
But something in my head would't reset
Can't give up on us yet
no woah (no woah)
Your love was so real
It pulled me in just like a magnetic field
I let you go but something's taking the wheel
Yeah, it's taking the Wheel

Oh Woah
My mind says no
You're no good for me
You're no good
But heart's made up on you
My body can't take what you give to me
what you give

got my heart made up on you

Got my heart made up on you
I should be making a break
up all night thinking of
planning my escape
But this insomnia ain't going away
and now I'm back at your place

Oh No
My mind says no
you're no good for me
you're no good
but my heart's made up on you
My body can't take what you give to me
what you give

got my heart made up on you

Got my heart made up on you
Look what you did, what you did
what you're doing to me
You got me searching for the words
like a silent movie
Love can't breathe, love can't see
So out of control
But baby honestly my hands

are up I'm letting go

Got my heart made up on you
My mind says no
you're not good for me
you're not good
but my heart's made up on you
My body can't take what you give to me
what you give
got my heart made up on you
My heart
says no...
Got my heart made up on you
(up on you)
(up on you)
Yeah
