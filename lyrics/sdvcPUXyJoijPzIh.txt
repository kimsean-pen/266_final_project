Under lights that never go out
We drive
And focus on the change
You become my face as I replace it
With the mirrors and the glass
And the houses that we pass

We drive all night
You've come a long way to find
Emptiness
We hear it all night
See it flicker overhead
So void of life

In due time all of this will pass
In a sudden storm
When you take my hand
So cold this april
Don't you think
We call on the void
The void will answer us
