I'm in the deepest darkest silence
But I'm hearing you
Living inside my head
Under my lovers bed, ooh
I'm commanding my soul to go deeper
Open up and become a receiver
I got no room left in the light now
Pushing, pulling you
It's like a crowded house
That no one knows about, ooh
I'm commanding my soul to go deeper
Open up and become a receiver
I come out of my soul

I'm going ghost, I'm going ghost
On you, till you're out of sight
I'm going ghost, I'm going ghost
On you, fading till the night

Here's to the walls that [?] us
Everywhere I go
You're always by my side
In the corner of my eye, ooh
I'm commanding my soul to go deeper
Open up and become a receiver
I'm commanding my soul to go deeper
Open up and become a receiver. Chorus]
I'm going ghost, I'm going ghost
On you, till you're out of sight
I'm going ghost, I'm going ghost
On you, fading till the light

If I have to keep the [?]
And kill the feelings I have
I'm going ghost
I'm commanding my soul to go deeper
Open up and become a receiver
I'm commanding my soul to go deeper
Open up and become a receiver
I'm commanding my soul to go
I'm commanding my soul to go
I'm going ghost
I'm going ghost on you
Fading till the night

I'm going ghost, I'm going ghost
On you, till you're out of sight
I'm going ghost, I'm going ghost
On you, fading till the night
