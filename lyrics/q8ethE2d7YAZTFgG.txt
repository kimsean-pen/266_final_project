Young girl,
get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run, girl,
You're much too young, girl

With all the charms of a woman
You've kept the secret of your youth
You led me to believe, you're old enough
to give me love
And now it hurts to know the truth,

Oh, young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run, girl,
You're much too young, girl

Beneath your perfume and make-up
You're just a baby in disguise
And though you know that it's wrong to be
alone with me
That come on look is in your eyes,

Oh, young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run, girl,
You're much too young, girl

So hurry home to your mama
I'm sure she wonders where you are
Get out of here before I have the time
to change my mind
'Cause I'm afraid we'll go too far,,

Oh, young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run girl,
You're much too young, girl

Young girl,
get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run, girl,
You're much too young, girl
