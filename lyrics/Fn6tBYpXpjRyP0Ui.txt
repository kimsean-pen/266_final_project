Ge, you've changed since the day you told me your name
Yes, you've changed, your kisses don't feel the same
How, you've changed, our romance to play from dance

First you told me that you loved me and I believed
Then you sold me with the vow that you'd never leave
Now you scold me, caring not how my heart grieves

Hmm, how I've loved you, since the day you told me your name
Yes, I loved you, thinking you all the wild that'll upsane
And I'l still love you, even knowin' I know you've changed
