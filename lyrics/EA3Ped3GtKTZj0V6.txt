In a perfect world, you're crawling back to me
But that's absurd, cause it'll never happen

You broke away from it all, need a little space to breathe
But you were jumping the gun, took another shot at me
I've been so inclined to tell you, all the places
I've been going without the weight,
of a self destructive waste you were to me
You're lust fades away with each lie
Well my minds made up, you can't have it all

In a perfect world, you're crawling back to me
But that's absurd, cause it will never happen
Wait my turn, I know you're gonna get what you deserve
It's too late to make amends from what I've learned,
by every bridge you've burned

I have to give it to you, you play the part so very well
You live to lure the ones too pure,
the difference they can't tell
But no mistake about it, you're a trouble
I can't seem to put to bed
While I've got you tangled in my head
You're lust fades away with each lie
Well my minds made up, you can't have it all

Stay away from me Stay away from me
Well how many times will you lead me to think?
That this could be something, I'm not listening

In a perfect world, you're crawling back to me
But that's absurd, cause it will never happen
Wait my turn, I know you're gonna get what you deserve
It's too late to make amends
In a perfect world But it will never happen
