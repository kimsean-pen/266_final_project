I saw God in death through you
Most things we'll never know
The darkest water runs in
The feasting cancerous
The questions burn in cages
Of a masterless life of disease
All that feel the warning see to will its steeds
Of black to cut us down
Of white to light our sound
Of red to burn and drown
And grey to spread like ash to the ground
