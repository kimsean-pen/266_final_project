You will move
With me we will
Stay still and
Words will move around us.
Surround us in gold
And in our world
We will be
Silent.

You will swim
To me we will
Be free
And words will
Swim around us
Surround us in schools
And in our cool
We'll be reminded.

That you refuse to fade away
I hide to stay the same
Where do we go from here
I don't know.

For me you flower to be chosen
I fall down to be noticed
Where do we go from here i don't know.

It was a time
A way of life
The only secrets
We talked about
Were all the fears
In all these years
We spent together
