How long, I haven't seen you for a while
How long, since the day we met
Cause you are the only one for me
And you are the only one I see
So would you please, don't you runaway from me
Or baby if you disappear, I'll be drown in my tears
Cause you are the only one for me
And you are the only one I see
Do you know
that I wrote this stupid song for you
And do you know, that I miss you so
Cause you are the only one for me
And you are the only one, the only one
Cause you are the only one for me
And you are the only one I see
Baby I think you should know that I miss you so
and I, and I want you right here
I'll never ever let you go
So please, please don't go
How long, I haven't seen you for a while...
