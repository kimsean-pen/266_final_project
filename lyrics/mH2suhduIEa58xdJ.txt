Little girls don't know how to be sweet girls
Mama didn't teach me
Little boys don't know how to treat little girls
Daddy didn't show me
Face down, on top of your bed
Oh why did I give it up to you?
Is this how I shoot myself up high,
Just high enough to get through?

Again, the false affection
Again, we break down inside
Love, save the empty
Love, save the empty, and save me

Sad boy, you stare up at the sky
When no one's looking back at you
You wear your every last disguise;
You're flying, then you fall through

Again, the false attention
Again, you're breaking inside
Love, save the empty
Love, save the empty, save me
Love, save the empty
Love, save the empty

Stars feel like knives,
They tell us why we're fighting
Storm, wait outside
Oh, love, hold us together

Love, save the empty
Love, save the empty
Love, save the empty
Love, save the empty, and save me
And save me.
