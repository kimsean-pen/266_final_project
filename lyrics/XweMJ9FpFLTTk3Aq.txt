I could tell you all about it
if i just knew where to start
thought i would never doubt it
till the day you fell apart
now a complicated story
a beginning and an end
don't know what you did before me
i dont care about where you've been
sorry i know im impossible
i dont know why i've been needing to take it slow
i dont know what to say
i know why he's still dancing in my brain
i i i'm with you and it's not the same
i know why i believe in things unsaid
i i i'm sleeping in the wrong bed
you could tell me all about her
about the way she said your name
how you couldnt live without her
how you'll never be the same
we could play that came forever
scratching out eachother's scars
tell me how that would be better
wouldnt get us very far
baby you're tired just let it go
move closer
don't need to talk we could take it slow
there's nothing more to say
i know why he's still dancing in my brain
i i i'm with you and it's not the same
i know why i believe in things unsaid
i i i'm sleeping in the wrong bed
i know why he's still dancing in my brain
i i i'm with you and it's not the same
i know why i believe in things unsaid
i i i'm sleeping in the wrong bed
i know why
