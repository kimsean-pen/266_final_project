They say that I shot a man down
For not picking up the check
What they don't know it won't hurt them
So keep moving down the line
Just cause I like my diamonds bright
Ain't saying I'm wrong or if it's right
But baby I've never been wrong before
Cash is everything I need so show me the money!
Cash is everything I need so give it to me honey!
Oh what you see... is what you get!
And you ain't see... nothing yet!
They say that I broke a man down
For not giving me respect
Should've spent more cause worth it
I just ain't got the time
You better choose your battles right
Shoot when you see whites' others' eyes
Oh baby I wish you had the dough
But you don't
Cash is everything I need so show me the money!
Cash is everything I need so give it to me honey!
Oh what you see... is what you get!
And you ain't see... nothing yet!
Daddy ain't got no cash
Daddy go six foot deep
Daddy ain't got no green
Daddy gotta go to sleep
Daddy ain't got no cash
Daddy ought to go six deep
Daddy ain't got no green
Daddy gotta go to sleep
Cash is everything I need so show me the money!
Cash is everything I need so give it to me honey!
Oh what you see... is what you get!
And you ain't see... nothing yet!
Cash is everything I need so show me the money!
Cash is everything I need so give it to me honey!
Oh what you see... is what you get!
And you ain't see... nothing yet!
