Endemicy - Enthrall the underworld
Pervade the bodies once their souls have gone astray
Gravitation - Await the birth of death
Despair is nurtured in the womb of annihilation

Your god is the epitome of my doings
Unaware and unable he is forsaken

Nullify - Abrupt and merciless
Deep-seated hatred from the beginning of time
Abolishing
Eternity has passed and the world's been cast away
Abdication - The throne has turned to dust
Skies are fading from the darkness as it rapes the land
Diminishing
Terminal is he who spectates from above this all

Your god is the epitome of my doings
No one is spared from the funeral inception

God forbid
God forbidden

Scourged then condemned
Pleading for your life and the abandonment of what's to come
Plagued then erased
Inhaled into the lungs of your extinction

Faith in the heavens has shattered
Broken pieces fall from the sky
