A blood stained shirt, seductive smile
With eyes full of hate and murders in style
The sky turns red, the air is cold
With one last chance to do as I'm told

This city is far from here, now turn back
Turn back, I'm scared
But in the bright lights we fade
Into the rear view mirror

This is the last attempt at a mere goodbye
It's just beginning, does this story have an end?
Can you feel my empty heart inside a box?
And barely beating, the walls are closing in

So take me hand, we'll run forever till it ends

Look what I've done now
You're dying from love and you're bleeding
Why can't I just wake up from this life?
'Cause I'm dreaming

Look what I've done now
I'm sick of this town and I'm leaving
Why can't I just wake up from this life?
'Cause I'm dreaming

It doesn't matter much, all those mistakes we made
We're through now and we are leaving town tonight
Outside a broken dream I feel unusual but safe there
Like nothing can stop us now

Take my hand, we'll run forever till it ends

Look what I've done now
You're dying from love and you're bleeding
Why can't I just wake up from this life?
'Cause I'm dreaming

Look what I've done now
I'm sick of this town and I'm leaving
Why can't I just wake up from this life?
'Cause I'm dreaming

Your sultry eyes, your common kiss
I'm in disguise, it's something I miss
Your lipsticks smears, I'm feeling gray
With not much time to take me away

This city is far from here, now turn back
Turn back, I'm scared
But in the bright lights we fade
Into the rear view mirror, rear view mirror

Look what I've done now
You're dying from love and you're bleeding
Why can't I just wake up from this life?
'Cause I'm dreaming

Look what I've done now
I'm sick of this town and I'm leaving
Why can't I just wake up from this life?
'Cause I'm dreaming

Look what I've done now
You're dying from love and you're bleeding
