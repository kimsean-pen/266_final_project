You'll never fly, if you're too scared of the height
You'll never live if you're just too scared to die
Everybody wants heaven... I know
but darling freedom ain't free, its a long road
You'll never find your place up there in the sky...
If you never say goodbye...
If you never say goodbye.

You'll never fly, if you're too scared of the height
You'll never live if you're just too scared to die
Everybody wants heaven... I know
but darling freedom ain't free, its a long road
You'll never find your place up there in the sky...
If you never say goodbye...
If you never say goodbye.
