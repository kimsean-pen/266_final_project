It's my obsession, my obligation
Bringing us closer to our deprivation
You are the spirit like Lady Godiva
Fire a rocket like a breakthrough starshot

I'm activated, I'm not aggravated, yeah
Shouldn't be complicated,
stay with me, stay with me
My destination is the emancipated
As I go straight into the breakthrough starshot

Breakthrough starshot, yeah yeah
The way to the top, gonna reach into the earthcore
Here we are, never drop, yeah yeah
Now think of the end
There is always something bigger than that

It's coming closer, it's coming in hard
And I am overloaded, breakthrough starshot
It's overrated, it's under my radar
Undomesticated, breakthrough starshot

I'm activated, I'm not aggravated, yeah
Shouldn't be complicated, stay with me, stay with me
My expectation is the accelerated
Another journey to the breakthrough sharshot

Breakthrough starshot, yeah yeah
The way to the top, gonna reach into the earthcore
Here we are, never drop, yeah yeah
Now think of the end
There is always something bigger than that

Breakthrough starshot, the way to the top
The way to the top, gonna reach into the earthcore
Here we are, never drop
Now think of the end, there is always...

Breakthrough starshot, yeah yeah
The way to the top, gonna reach into the earthcore
Here we are, never drop, yeah yeah
Now think of the end
There is always something bigger than that
