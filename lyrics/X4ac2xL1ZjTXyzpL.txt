From the western isles to the tasman sea
There's a world of men and machinery
But the birds still sing and the sun shines free
No, I don't need much when I still have thee

Well, the rolling stones wrote a song for me
It's a minor song in a major key
But the stars still shine, the museums free
No, I don't need much when I still have thee

It's a modern hymn for the you and me
For the go between and the red army
Long as I still breathe and the air's still free
No, I don't need much when I still have thee

But the birds still sing and the sun shines free
No, I don't need much when I still have thee
For the rolling stones and the red army
No, I don't need much when I still have thee
