Determination, have I got what it takes?
Use every fibre of my being just to keep it at bay,
Keeps me coming back around and around and I like it,

Determination, I might like what I see,
But I know just one sip will wake the devil in me,
Seems lately,
I keep spinning 'cause I like that sound, I like it,

Superlove,
Levitate, up, up,
Levitate, up, up, oh, no
Don't know how to act,
Fell in love with a maniac, oh no
Superlove,
Gravitate, up, up,
Gravitate, up, up, oh, no
Don't overreact,
Fell in love with a maniac, oh no

It keeps calling to me,
And i'm loving every minute of this darkness you see,
But I keep coming back, 'cause I like the sound, I like it,

Should not be here,

Levitate, I can't wait,
Keeps me coming back around and I like it,
Addicted to the sound yeah, I love it,
