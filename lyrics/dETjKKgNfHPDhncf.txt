You thought I should see
I thought it looked fun
You thought you led me
I thought I should run
But wanted to stay
Stay out of the sun
You saved me some shade
I saved you some blood (short, short)

Short hair, tall tale of death
(Short, short)
You're making me short, short of breath
Short hair, long stride for death
(Short, short)
You're making me so short of breath

You wanted to play
I said I was game
You flipped over death
To greet you by name
To speak through the smoke
Intoning your voice
Reminded me I always had a choice (short, short)

Short hair, tall tale of death
(Short, short)
You're making me short, short of breath
Short hair, long stride for death
(Short, short)
You're making me so short of breath

Only one side
Only one remains
Only one side of love

Only one side
Only one remains
Only one side of love

One side of love remains the same (short, short)

Short hair, tall tale of death
(Short, short)
You're making me short, short of breath
Short hair, long stride for death
(Short, short)
You're making me so short of breath

Short hair, tall tale of death
(Short, short)
You're making me, making me, oh
Short hair, long stride for death
(Short, short)
You're making me so short of breath

Only one side
Only one remains
Only one side of love

Only one side
Only one remains
Only one side of love
