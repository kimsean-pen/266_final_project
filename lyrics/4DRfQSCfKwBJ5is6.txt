Lost in the darkness
I fade from the light
Faith of my father, my brother, my maker and savior
Help me make it through the night

Blood on my conscience
and murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine

The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine, you keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
is God alive or is God dead?
is God dead?

Rivers of evil
Run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust, creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole

When will this nightmare be over?
Tell me!
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?

To safeguard my philosophy
Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a living dead
I empathize with enemies until the timing's right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light
I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine I don't need bread

These riddles that live in my head
I don't believe that God is dead!
God is dead?

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word
What the good book says
Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead?
God is dead!
God is dead!
God is dead!
God is dead!
Right!
But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that God is dead
The blood pours down
The rain turns red
I don't believe that God is dead
God is dead!
God is dead!
God is dead!
