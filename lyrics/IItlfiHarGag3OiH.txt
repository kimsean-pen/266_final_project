They're kicking us out saying it's time to close
We're leaning on each other try'na beat the cold
Carry your shoes and I give you my coat
Walking these streets like their paved gold
There anyone excuse's not to go
Neither one of us want to take that taxi home

Singing our hearts out standing on chairs
Spending our time like we are millionaires
Laughing our heads of, the two of us there
Spending our time like we are millionaires
Millionaires
ooohoh
ooohoh
Lost my heart and I hope to die
Seeing that sunlight hit your eyes

Been up all night but you still look amazing to me
Yeah
Half the time of the night you only dream about
If a god came down he could take me now
Cause in my mind, yeah we will always be
Singing our hearts out standing on chairs
Spending our time like we are millionaires

Laughing our heads of, the two of us there
Spending our time like we are millionaires
Millionaires
Check out us at six in the morning
If time was money, yeah we'd be worth a fortune
I swear you may think your'e rich
You could have a million euro but you cant buy this
Look at us since six in the morning
If time was money, yeah we'd be worth a fortune

I swear you may think your'e rich
You could have a million euro but you cant buy this bridge.
And the band was on, playing our song
We messed up the lyrics as we sang along
But we didn't care
Cause it felt like we where the only ones there
My feet where sore, my bones where raw

They're turning off the lights, when we where shouting more
Shouting more
Singing our hearts out standing on chairs
Spending our time like we are millionaires
Laughing our heads of, the two of us there
Spending our time like we are millionaires
Millionaires

Look at us since six in the morning
If time was money, yeah we'd be worth a fortune
I swear you may think your'e rich
You could have a million euro but you cant buy this
Look at us since six in the morning
If time was money, yeah we'd be worth a fortune
I swear you may think your'e rich
You could have a million euro but you cant buy this
Walking these streets like their paved gold
There anyone excuse's not to go
Neither one of us want to take that taxi home
