The wind in my hair
And the black in my eyes
I was holding back tears
As I reeled with surprise
There was no one to phone
I just chewed at the time
I was waving goodbye
To control of my mind

And the beat of my heart
Marks the passing of time
And I just wanna scream to the sky
There are times when my mind is an explosion of feelings
I'm trying to hold on to the soul inside

I go looking for lies
In your play-the-game eyes
But I couldn't find the way out
The where's or the why's
Should I laugh
Should I cry
Should I live
Should I die?
It's a wild celebration of feelings inside

And the beat of my heart
Marks the passing of time
And I just wanna scream to the sky
And there are times when my mind is an explosion of feelings
I'm trying to hold on to the soul inside

And the beat of my heart

Marks the passing of time
And I just wanna scream to the sky
And there are times when my mind is an explosion of feelings
I'm trying to hold on to the soul inside
And the beat of my heart
Marks the passing of time
And I just wanna scream to the sky
And there are times when my mind is an explosion of feelings

I'm trying to hold on to the soul inside
(I've got to hold on to the soul to the soul to the soul inside)

to the soul Inside...
It's a wild celebration of the feelings inside
(It's a wild celebration of the feelings inside)
It's a wild it's a wild it's a wild celebration of feelings inside

(it's a wild it's a wild it's a wild it's a wild it's a wild)
And it's tearing me...
And it's tearing me up
And it's tearing me up
And it's tearing me up
It's a wild...
It's a wild celebration of feelings inside
It's a wild... it's a wild...
Celebration of feelings inside
And I'm trying to hold on
And I'm trying to hold on
And I'm trying to hold on
Hold on...
Hold hold hold hold on
Feelings... inside...
