Red light, green light, one, two, three
Try your best, can't fuck with me
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Try your best, can't fuck with me

Okay, nobody stop me
I'm on my green light, go
Everything I do is big
I'm on my fee, fi, fo
I came up from out the dirt
I'm like a concrete rose
If I ever fall, I'm landing on my Gucci soles

I got my foot on the gas
I'm Usain Bolt on the dash
That and debunking the facts
Racing and chasing the cash
Ain't no one catching up with me
If you gon' blink, you gon' miss me
Why can nobody stop me? I'm on my green light, go (Go)

Ten mil on my social (Woo)
I can't be antisocial (Woo)
It's viral once I post it (Woo)
Lil' girls got my posters (Woo)
I do a buck in the Rover (Woo)
I'm never stuck on the shoulder (Woo)
Nobody pulling me over
Nah, like a No Limit solider (No Limit)

Head down, let me free my mind
Lil' bitch, don't try kill my vibe
LAX where we fly high
I see you on the other side

Okay, nobody stop me
I'm on my green light, go
Everything I do is big
I'm on my fee, fi, fo
I came up from out the dirt
I'm like a concrete rose
If I ever fall, I'm landing on my Gucci soles

I got my foot on the gas
I'm Usain Bolt on the dash
That and debunking the facts
Racing and chasing the cash
Ain't no one catching up with me
If you gon' blink, you gon' miss me
Why can nobody stop me? I'm on my green light, go (Go)

I spent all my life on the lifelines on it (Brrp)
That's how bad I want, that's how bad I want it
Swapping on my green light, go
I been unstoppable
I been on that vamonos
I been on that Inglewood
I'ma been misunderstood
I'm so far from Hollywood

Hustling tryna make it just
Yeah, I gotta get it though
I look like a centrefold
Good for you like vegetables
Wanna try my edibles?
If you can, I'll let you know

La cabra they call me the GOAT
On my mama, I would never fold
Just in case you didn't know
I do this shit for Mexico

Okay, nobody stop me
I'm on my green light, go
Everything I do is big
I'm on my fee, fi, fo
I came up from out the dirt
I'm like a concrete rose
If I ever fall, I'm landing on my Gucci soles

I got my foot on the gas
I'm Usain Bolt on the dash
That and debunking the facts
Racing and chasing the cash
Ain't no one catching up with me
If you gon' blink, you gon' miss me
Why can nobody stop me? I'm on my green light, go (Go)

Red light, green light, one, two, three
Try your best, can't fuck with me
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Try your best, can't fuck with me
