I got my hustle dawg
I gets my hustle off
Oxy contin heroin
Craaaaaazy
I got my chopper dawg
Don't make me chop him off

Chop chop chop chop knock him off
Blood on the wall death in the air
Birds on the ground pistols everywhere
Devils in the eyes babies always cry
Papa never home fuck it we all alone
Tryna get rich?
Grab me the beaker i'll measure the white
Heat up the water drop it in pot
Baking soda and? make it rock
Get you a saucer the razor go chop
Get you a Glock and invest in a block
Set up ya shop dare em to? pop?
Fuck? by da cop his ass would shot ya?
Satan in your soul let it take control

Oxy cotin fiends keep the foil low

Let the pill burn inhale exhale it slow
Let yo heart explode drop ya to the floor
I gets the dough I hustle hard? ain't got shit on moi
Green beans 80s fo sure
They like what im talkin bout
You know what im talkin bout

No syringes or nothiin
Just heroines cousin smoke mufflers out
Only lords knows
And only time'll tell
Will I got to heaven
Or will I burn in hell
Music in my mind
Vibratin down my spine
Travels to my heart
Shoulda been here from the start
Now I get breath from my audio (?)

You know I ain't talkin a xanny bro

(nigga we on it be up by the mornin)

You wreck a new bitch wearin panties tho
(threw out my line)Fish up fo sho
(nigga we eatin ya) Ox to know
(put my big boy in her) nebulo
There she blows higher power controlin her hustle
Keep goin she shittin on niggas excuse all our corners
Boss after boss? like we ballin we here for the moment
(We gettin this cash) My? be imported my bitch be imported
My grind get distorted your life get deported
Ch-ch-ch-ch-choppers deployin
Loosin my brain while recordin on
