She's been
Dancing in a topless bar
And she's doing well
So far
She is
Working to earn her own dollar
'Cause the fortune teller didn't talk about stars

She has black and white eyes
A mind full of vintage squibs
She has black and white eyes
A mind full of cheering lives

She needs
Something
To keep
Her feet on the ground
'Cause when she's flying around
She never wants
To come back down
She lost
Her smile in '95
When she woke up on the back seat of a studded car

She has black and white eyes
A mind full of vintage squibs
She has black and white eyes
A mind full of cheering lives

'think I
Lost her
At 24
When she started
To lock herself up
Behind the bathroom door

"I'm done"

All along the white line
She can travel back in time
All along the white line

All along the white line
She can travel back in time
All along the white line

I'm on
My way
Looking up today
Never mind if it could be worthing
Tuesday flies away
