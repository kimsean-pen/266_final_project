Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Fall in love again
Yeah

Baby, baby, fallin' in love, I'm fallin' in love again
Everyday I love you more and more
Baby, baby, fallin' in love, I'm fallin' in love again

Uh hoo

I could never see what fate had planned for me
And then you came and made a dream my reality
Maybe you can't see all the things you've lead to me
Well my simple fate is at the gate and boy, you've got the key

Baby, baby, fallin' in love, I'm fallin' in love again
Everyday I love you more and more
Baby, baby, fallin' in love, I'm fallin' in love again

Oh yeah

It seems like yesterday you and I first loved this way
But now I know how love can grow with each and every day
As we lay at midnight hour and feel loves hidden power
So strong and bold as life unfolds the mystery to me

Baby, baby, fallin' in love, I'm fallin' in love again
Everyday I love you more and more
Baby, baby, fallin' in love, I'm fallin' in love again

Hey hey

I never dream that my summertime flame could show me
How much pleasure the winter can bring
Hooked up by the fireplace time I don't waste
As I love you slow then increase the pace

Your natural body perfume brightens up any room
One whiff and my spirits taken up-lift it feels good
When your woman is your best friend
But it's better when you fall in love again

Baby, baby, fallin' in love, I'm fallin' in love again
Everyday I love you more and more
Baby, baby, fallin' in love, I'm fallin' in love again

Baby, baby, fallin' in love, I'm fallin' in love again
Everyday I love you more and more
Baby, baby, fallin' in love, I'm fallin' in love again

Baby, baby, fallin' in love, I'm fallin' in love again
Everyday I love you more and more
Baby, baby, fallin' in love, I'm fallin' in love again
