Can you hear them talking about us
Telling lies, is that a surprise
Can you see them, see right through them
They have a shield, nothing must be revealed
It doesn't matter what they say, no one listens anyway

Our lips are sealed
There's a weapon that we can use in our defence: silence

Well just look at them, look right through them
That's when they disappear, that's when we lose the fear
It doesn't matter what they say, in the jealous games people play

Our lips are sealed
It doesn't matter what they say, no one's listening anyway
Our lips are sealed

Hush, my darling, don't you cry
Guardian angel, forget their lies

Can you hear them talking about us
Telling lies, well that's no surprise
Can you see them, see right through them
They have a shield, nothing must be revealed
It doesn't matter what they say in the jealous games people play

Our lips are sealed
Pay no mind to what they say, it doesn't matter anyway
Our lips are sealed
Our lips are sealed
Our lips are sealed
