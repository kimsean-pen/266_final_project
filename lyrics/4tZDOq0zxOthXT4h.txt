I didn't mean for any of this to happen
We sure have crossed the line
Nothing hunts us like the things we don't say
I saw you climbing the roof trying to concentrate

But I'll never be the one who breaks the silence you decreed
So now I have to wait 'til your forget

I'm still waiting for you,
I'm still waiting for a minimal communication

Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
For a minimal communication
