I don't own a soul with a conscience
I'm just trying to be a little honest
But I know
Can't explain it to you more
I promise I'm not this thoughtless
To you I've been a lot less
I know it shows
But I can't live like this no more
No I can't hold your hand anymore
No I can't hold your hand no more

You wouldn't know unless you felt it
So hold those tears and yell yeah
Ooh let me tell you
It's something else yeah
And how am I supposed to help it?
If I don't even love myself yeah
Ooh let me tell you
It's something else yeah

I'm so afraid of losing
This heart that's finally moving
But I know
These are all just chemicals
And trust, I've tried refusing
But girl this ain't a new thing
I've had my fun
Now all the worst is yet to come

All the worst is yet to come
All the worst is yet to come

You wouldn't know unless you felt it
So hold those tears and yell yeah
Ooh let me tell you
It's something else yeah
And how am I supposed to help it?
If I don't even love myself yeah
Ooh let me tell you
It's something else yeah

You wouldn't know unless you felt it
So hold those tears and yell yeah
Ooh let me tell you
It's something else yeah
And how am I supposed to help it?
If I don't even love myself yeah
Ooh let me tell you
It's something else yeah
Woah oh

This time, this time
And I'm at such a loss
Can't find myself without you
Can't find myself without you
