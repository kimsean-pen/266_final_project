Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done

Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do

3030, way past the millennium, check it out
Yo, Deltron thunder force, ain't no other source of sunlight
Two ton mic, leave you tongue-tied
Runnin' amuck with technology with no apology
Shoutin' out to my colony with third eye physiology
Millennium past apocalypse is all I spit
Make you swallow it, your weak style, I'll abolish it
With nuclear rockets, they glued to your optics with sci-fi
Unsettlin', man and metal blends
Underground chillin' with the Mole Man and his whole fam
Inhibit bacterial growth, material wrote
Impenetrable, incontestable, indigestible intelligence
Never let a computer tell me shit
It's rapid innovation, penetratin' artificial life forms who bite songs
I'm a buy a vest, lie is next, then I'll flip the bio-techs
Right into the wireless, your third eye is hit with psoriasis
The mightiest, Deltron Zero
Traverse and purge the travesties that tempt your earholds
The area of distribution lifts the clueless
My flow is like liquid oxygen
Rip it often with specific impulse, increasin' thrust
Grease the cuts, unleash a cluster of thoughts I muster
I talk to touch ya and rupture commercial communications
Convert solar energy into imagery in the mind's eye
Blindside the contagious with radioactive isotopes to decay them
Atomic mass they small as fragments, I magnetize the avid lies
My radiation shields reflects, rejects Decepticons
Who take the truth and stretch it long, while I bless a song
Next level incredible, metal melding, flexibility
And my engine is never failing

Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done

Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do

All your rhyme histories combined couldn't violate
The Prime Optimus operative
Use my hydrometer to see how warm you are
Watch me form a star, hydrogen turned to helium when I shine
Ridin' 'em, revealin' 'em, leadin' 'em, to the vacuum
Interact with tunes in my digital citadel
Critical pivotal with the mental shit on you
Spit infinity, hidden energies too dope for our planet
Star spannin', slammin' hymns with mechanical limbs
Scanning your lens with cosmic rays
You'll all get played, your brain's inferior
I hit the lateral and posterior, my science is eerier
Ionic bonding for your moronic pondering, meet the armorines
My micro machines, might throw your team, into paralysis
They not talented, just a malady, worry 'bout a salary, creative casualty
Couldn't defrag my power density intensity
Nonequivalence, nine hundred Newtons
Crush you like croutons, you plus Houston
Hiero's like dipoles inside a silo, turbulence ten-fold, never simple
Defies accepted methods development most unique
Paralyze central nervous when you close to me
Interstellar void fills with color, appears to bubble
And split into four like amoeba
Inhabitin' planets with grandiose boast and coast like Silver Surfer
Feel the purpoise, high velocity, verbal atrocities
Fire resistance, better hire assistants
My pistons glisten ultra, high performance
Inside your private quarters where I fry your components

Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done

Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do
