White eyes in coal mines
Concrete industry
Bare backs, baseball caps

The sweat is part of life
We're still thriving
We've got a lot of mouths to feed
And we're trying
You think I do this for me
Join the caste
Flip through old photographs of our family's past

Building your home, giving your life, our livelihood
Creators
It's always been like this
People you never see, the ones you'll never be
Working with their hands
We've downsized again
All through history building piece by piece

It's not for you to erase with your algebra and your science

Simple labor
