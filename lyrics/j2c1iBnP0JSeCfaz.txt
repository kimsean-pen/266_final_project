I'm tired of fake fortunes being sold
I'm tired of my tyres burning rubber on the road
Tired of the distance
The lengths that I go to
Trying to get a bit of credit from you
Fuck that
Real love feels real
So I don't need to try to synthesise
The feel

I'm trying to unlock doors with these musical keys
My friends puff trees to the Z to a G
Oh no
And all I do is twinkle the ivory keys
Indulgently, 'cause I do this for me
I know

And it just feels a little bit like
Somebody cut a hole in my pockets
'Cause I've been trying to do this right
With no profits and the loss I can't stop it

And consumption lies at the heart of my bad habits
I live in a world where I want but can't have it
Tell me why that is the way it is
I need some real love, to feel real
But people all around me still try to leave the ties that feel

I'm trying to unlock doors with these musical keys
Eventually I smoke a Z to a G
Oh no
And all I do is twinkle the ivory keys
It's no wonder why I make no Ps
I know

But it just feels a little bit like
Somebody cut a hole in my pockets
Cause I've been trying to do this right
With no profits and the loss I can't stop it

It just feels a little bit like
Somebody cut a hole in my pockets
Cause I've been trying to do this right
With no profits and the loss I can't stop it

It just feels a little bit like
Somebody cut a hole in my pockets
Cause I've been trying to do this right
With no profits and the loss I can't stop it
