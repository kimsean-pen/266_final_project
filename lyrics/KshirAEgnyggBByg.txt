Love you bring me to my knees
I'll do anything that you tell me to
We can share the same disease
I'll sacrifice my heart to you

Holding hands eternally
Laughing together, so happily

We dug our hands in the garden
To bury our little problem
Where the flowers die, little heathen
Where the flowers die, and stop breathing

We dug our hands in the garden
To bury our little problem
Where the flowers die, little heathen
Where the flowers die, and stop breathing

We'll carve our names into a tree
Before we dissolve under our skin
Forever is something we can be
Oh my sweet carcinogen

Holding hands eternally
Laughing together, so happily

We dug our hands in the garden
To bury our little problem
Where the flowers die, little heathen
Where the flowers die, and stop breathing

We dug our hands in the garden
To bury our little problem
Where the flowers die, little heathen
Where the flowers die, and stop breathing
