After all is said and done
I'm left with reflections of your eyes, haunting my mind
So dead inside, what good came out of this?

I was the one that tore you down
I was the one that tore you...
I'm down yet oh so guilty, I'm down
Every last breath I have is yours to keep
I'm down yet oh so guilty, I'm down
Every Last breath I have is yours to keep

This constant cloud is watching over me
Oh, I wish I had the time to make you see this through
See this through...
We've been here too many times
I've felt like this too many times
We've been here too many times
Oh god, I am this
I'm dead on the inside, looking out for you
And your final words...

This constant cloud is watching over me
Oh, I wish I had the time to make you see this through
This constant cloud is watching over me
Oh, I wish I had the time to make you see this one through
See this one through

And after all is said and done
I'm left with reflections of your eyes, haunting my mind
I'm so dead inside
What good came out of this?
What good came out of this?

I was the one that tore you down
I was the one that tore you down
I was the one that tore you down
I was the one that tore you down

Down, I'm down, yet oh so guilty
Now I'm, not used to this
