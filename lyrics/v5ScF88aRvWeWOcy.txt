The childhood part of my life wasn't very pretty
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children beside me
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep
It was hard times
Needed something to ease my troubled mind

My father didn't know the meaning of the word
He disrespected Mama and treated us like dirt
I left home seeking a job that I never did find
Depressed and down-hearted, I took to Cloud Nine

I'm doing fine, up here on Cloud Nine
Listen, one more time
I'm doing fine, up here on Cloud Nine

Folks now they tell me
They say, "Give yourself a chance and don't let life pass you by"
But the world around you is a rat race where only the strong survive
It's a dog-eat-dog world and that ain't no lie (ain't no lie)
Listen, it ain't even safe no more, to walk the streets at night

I'm doing fine on Cloud Nine
Let me tell you about Cloud Nine

(Cloud Nine) You can be what you wanna be
(Cloud Nine) You ain't got no responsibility
(Cloud Nine) Every man, every man is free
(Cloud Nine) You're a million miles from reality (Reality)

I'm gonna sail up, up, higher, up, up
Up, up and away
Cloud Nine

I wanna say I love the life I live
And I'm gonna live the life I love
Up here on Cloud Nine
I'm riding high on Cloud Nine

You're as free as a bird in flight
(Cloud Nine) There's no difference between day and night
(Cloud Nine) It's a world of love and harmony
(Cloud Nine) You're a million miles from reality (Reality)

I'm gonna sail up, up, higher, up, up
Up, up and away
Cloud Nine

You can be what you wanna be
(Cloud Nine) You ain't got no responsibility
(Cloud Nine) Every man in his mind is free
(Cloud Nine) You're a million miles from reality
(Cloud Nine) You can be what you wanna be
