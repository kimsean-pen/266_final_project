Foundation cracks
The wounds are bleeding
The end is calling
The end
Is here

You're in a deathgrip
You're in a deathgrip
Death will know my name
You're at the world's end
You're at the world's end
I will be the last one standing
I can see the end
It's staring right back at me
I brought us here
A place laid to waste by humanity

The storms destroy
The quakes awaken
The end is calling
The end
Is here

You're in a deathgrip
You're in a deathgrip
Death will know my name
You're at the world's end
You're at the world's end
I will be the last one standing
I can see the end
It's staring right back at me
I brought us here
A place laid to waste by humanity

In a life of choice
I chose to deny
Through all of my sins
I chose to die
There will be nothing
When I've lost it all
Please God
Let this end painlessly

My memories
Are like a noose around my neck
I could never let go
Of all the regrets
Deathgrip

You're in a deathgrip
You're in a deathgrip
Death will know my name
You're at the world's end
You're at the world's end
I will be the last one standing
I can see the end
It's staring right back at me
I brought us here
A place laid to waste by humanity
