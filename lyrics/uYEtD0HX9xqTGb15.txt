O.K. Ready to take off
do it slow
I'm living on the bottom
I got to go
five little fingers
grabbing at the glass
gone, those days
now I'm running
up and down in my cage

Too late to defend, I'm buried - insane
don't you know there's more to life than to win
are you that kind of stereotype?
there's no time, there's no time
there's nothing I could answer

No Speech
as long (as) I get nothing
No Speech
as long (as) I get nothing
but I've got to get home
so let me free, this is not my home

Put away your
flashing stick
don't try to get closer-
through my head
give me a little
bit more of your own
a little more, don't wanna be
anybody's clown

Too late to defend, I'm buried - insane
don't you know there's more to life than to win
are you that kind of stereotype?
there's no time, there's no time
there's nothing I could answer

No Speech
as long (as) I get nothing
No Speech
as long (as) I get nothing
but I got to get home
let me free, this is not my home

No Speech
as long (as) I get nothing
No Speech
as long (as) I get nothing
but I want to get home
let me free, this is not my home
