If you died I'd hope you'd haunt me
'Cause you know I'd miss you bad
There's something I haven't told before
And if I left I'd hope you'd stop me
And kick my boxes from the left
Keep me 'round to see what I'd endure

'Cause I'm dying to be your everything, everything

You know I'll always be around
I'd never I'd never I'd never leave you hanging out to dry
Because the world's gonna pass me by
But if you wanted,
I'd never I'd never I'd never leave your leave your side
I'd never I'd never I'd never leave you out to dry
I'd never I'd never I'd never get you off my mind

When you're out I miss you badly
And write you songs like this today
There's something I haven't told before
You stopped me in my tracks, you caught me in a gaze
It's one of the things that I just can't help these days

'Cause I'm dying to be your everything, everything

You know I'll always be around
I'd never I'd never I'd never leave you hanging out to dry
Because the world's gonna pass me by
But if you wanted,
I'd never I'd never I'd never leave your leave your side
I'd never I'd never I'd never leave you out to dry
I'd never I'd never I'd never get you off my mind

If there ever came a dark day
That crushed us out and took you away
I'd chase you to the end
I'd chase you to the end of the world

You know I'll always be around
I'd never I'd never I'd never get you of my mind
You know I'll always be around
I'd never I'd never I'd never leave you hanging out to dry
Because the world's gonna pass me by
But if you wanted,
I'd never I'd never I'd never leave your leave your side
I'd never I'd never I'd never leave you out to dry
I'd never I'd never I'd never get you off my mind

I'd never I'd never I'd never leave you out to dry
(I'm dying to be)
I'd never I'd never I'd never get you of my mind
(you're everything, everything)
