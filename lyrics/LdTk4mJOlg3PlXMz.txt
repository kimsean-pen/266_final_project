You're that kind
That turns my head and makes me look
Whoa whoa whoa uh uh uh... uh
You're the kind
That makes me pull single dollars
Out my pocket book, ooh baby
You're sexiness and vivacity makes me
Wanna cook my favorite recipe
And place it on your table, baby
Your in-toxic ting and so divine
You're the kind that stays on a sista's mind
And I know you'll think this is crazy

But, I got something better at home
Ooh whoo oo woo woo
Hey hey I got something better at home
He's the kind that breaks it down
And curls my toes, woo woo woo baby ow

He's the kind that loves my mind and feeds my soul
And I love it baby
His intellect and outer respect, makes me wanna grow
And be my best
And I know...

He loves his baby
His sense of self and silliness
Makes the hardest things
The simplest and I

I look but don't touch
No no no baby
Cuz, I got something better at home
Ooh ohoo ooo

Cuz, I got something better at home
Ooh ohh woo wooo
Baby I know you love me
And your love is wonderful
You help me feel free

I wont betray you unintentionally, or intentionally
I got you babe
You can rest your shoulders and sleep at night
Okay
Alright cuz I know
Cuz I Know know know
I know, I got something better at home
Oh

I know oh oooh woo woo wooo
I got something better at home
Ohhhhh oohhhhhh
