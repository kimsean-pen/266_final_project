Deep into the bay
It would've been cold
But I was with a starling
Made of 300 karat gold

She had 500 lovers
But I was number 1
Her thighs were a-pumpin
They brought me to the sun

All of a sudden
She cried outside
My Aphrodite
Fell to her side

All of a sudden

She cried outside
My Aphrodite
She died, she died, she died

aaaahhh

All of a sudden
She cried outside
My Aphrodite
Fell to her side
All of a sudden
She cried outside
My Aphrodite
She died she died she died
