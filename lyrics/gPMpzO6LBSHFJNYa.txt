Reach into the void
Touch the heart of darkness
Reach for the light
Feel the hand of god

The uncertainty of my existence
Can be decided by choice of a path I must walk

So sick monotone culprit
Come on down and we'll talk about it
Bow down to the gods
Or keep on walking further
On the cusp of our enlightenment
We march

With the sun at my back
I take my first step outside shading my thoughts
And perceptions
Done from the truth I'll never run
Be it the light or the shadow
I walk in hand with all

Born of nothing
My thoughts are unconditional
And I despise the facade of the original martyr
Deep within the void
Higher

Searching for the light
We leave this world behind

The violent twisting of the fates
The eminent collapse of our current state
Separate the vacant space
From the condensed bodies, without trace

These carbon units can't see
What is beyond this entity
So free the souls of those who desire a higher being
Ready the way for a day of the golden age

Born of nothing
My thoughts are unconditional
And i despise the facade of the original martyr
Deep within the void
Higher

Searching for the light
We leave this world behind

Bow down to the gods
Or keep on walking further
On the cusp of our enlightenment
We march!
