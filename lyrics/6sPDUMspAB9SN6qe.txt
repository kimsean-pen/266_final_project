I'm shoveling
Like a feeling, baby
To your room
I am not
A lover who can give
To follow you

I can't tell for certain
I'm trying to hold her
The changing is certain
I'm failing for certain
Through
This
Tale

Now like your feet
Now I'm in sea bottle
Swollow you
The fun can remain
As long as I believe in you

I can't tell for certain
I'm trying to hold her
The changing is certain
I'm failing for certain
Through
This
Tale

I don't know what to say to you
