Throw up your rawkfist if ya feelin' it when I drop this
Show 'em how we blow this spot
Let's make it hot
Lets shock 'em wit da body rock 'til the party stops
It's time to take it up a notch
And leave it locked for all the headbangas in da parkin' lot
Here we come, if ya ready or not
No time to talk 'cuz we on the clock
Bringin the "oh-oh" to your block
Let me show ya where we comin' from
It don't stop, from L.A. to New York
Show me what you got now

All I know is what it did take to make this
All I am is what it will take to break this
All I know is what it did take to make this
All I am is what it will take to break this
Light it up now
Light it up now

Stop runnin' me down
Keep runnin' around
I'm fakin' you out
Would ya just make it what ya want it to be
About to find out what you're all about
I'm callin' you out
Would ya just set me free?

Stop runnin' me down
