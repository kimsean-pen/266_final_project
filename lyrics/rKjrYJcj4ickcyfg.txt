Stormy summer day is in the way of all the could've been's and should've been's
How do you anticipate this distorted tragedy
Things like this don't just go away,
things like this tear your family
And I admit I can't relate, believe me I won't walk away

'Cause when the circumstance holds you back... Lower the line

Harness, focus Your broken vessel
When you paint that picture; When you're all shook up

Harness, focus; 'Cause you know it won't die in your sleep

You finally said it out loud,
Stormy summer day is in the way of all the could've been's and should've been's
How do you anticipate this distorted tragedy
Maybe you're not dead though this could be the end of your world
But this door isn't sealed the black hole might tear if you fight
And I'ma be around until you see the light of day

I can see your pain
I don't see you shaded in a different light
