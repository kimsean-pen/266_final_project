Call me, baby, say that you want it
Call me, lately, feel that you want it
Give you all the pain that, lately
I've shown you
Give you all the things
I've lived through
Fill up, give them the world and
I know you better than them
Give you all the depths of my wanting
Stage two for the rest of the morning
Give you all that
You seem to know
Yeah, I'ma get it

Call me, baby, when you're ready
You got to know that they're
Not sayin' you can

I know it
I know it
I know it
I know it
You got a lot of static
You've got it in your bones

Call you in your name and
You know you gon' get it
Come and say the word
And you know you gon' hit it

That's the way that it
That's the way that it
That's the way that it
That's the way that it goes

Give you all the things I want
Give you all the things I want
The, all the
All the, all the, all

After it all (All the)
The world (All the)
The world (All the)
The world (All the)

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, baby
