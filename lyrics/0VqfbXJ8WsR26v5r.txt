All the things I knew I didn't know
And didn't want to know
That you told me
Just to tell me later that you'd told me so
Come flooding back to me now
Come on come flooding back to me now
All the things you said you'd never say and you said anyway
The things we did and didn't do
The things we did and didn't do
Come flooding back to me now
