It's the glare from the reflection
Making patterns in your eyes
It's the looking back in anger
Of every second slipping by

Undertow has come to take me
Guided by the blazing sun
Look at everything around us
And look at everything we've done

Please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself
I'm drowning here, please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself
I'm drowning here, please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself
I'm drowning here, please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself

There's a tiny little window
Swarms of locusts fill the sky
Maybe I just disappear
If I can keep my head above the tide

Please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself
I'm drowning here, please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself
I'm drowning here, please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself
I'm drowning here, please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself
