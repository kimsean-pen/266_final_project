I'd weigh a million pounds if you were gravity
I'd take a billion pills if they gave me sanity

Time has passed me by
Share my great advice
For granted, taken nice
Weigh a pit underneath the light

The force that perfect us
And all the affections
As they infect us, love couldn't help us
Ooh, you crawl underneath me

I'd die a million deaths, and you'd resurrect me
I'd fall a billion times, but you wouldn't let me
You wouldn't let me

The force that perfect us
And all the affections
As they infect us, love couldn't help us
Where would I go?
Where would I go?

Where would I go?
Where would I go?
Where would I go...?

Ooh, you crawl underneath me
