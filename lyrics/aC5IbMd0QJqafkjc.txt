Midnight gettin' uptight, Where are you?
You said you'd meet me, now it's quarter to two
I know I'm hangin' but I'm still wantin' you

Hey Jack, It's a fact they're talkin' in town
I turn my back and you're messin' around
I'm not really jealous, don't like lookin' like a clown

I think of you every night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away

I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you

Daylight spent the night without you
But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do
I won't be as angry 'bout the hell you put me through

Hey Man, betcha you can treat me right
You just don't know what you was missin' last night
I wanna see your face and say forget it just for spite

I think of you every night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away

I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you

I think of you every night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away

I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you

I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you

I hate myself
For loving you

I hate myself
For loving you

I hate myself
For loving you

I hate myself
I hate myself for loving you
