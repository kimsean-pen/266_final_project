I lie in bed but I can't sleep
On the ledge but I can't leap
Even doing nothing is so hard to do, to do

On my tongue but I can't speak
The simple things just are sometimes deep
I only hope that this means something to you, to you

I want to spend my life with you right by my side
'Cause when you kiss my lips I see the lighting in the sky

That's like one step forward and two steps back
'Cause love is like a hurricane
When you're with me I'm on track
We're riding on a crazy train
I'll be fine if you're mine at the end of the line

Butterflies I want to keep
I try to laugh but I just weep
There's something about you gets me so deep inside, inside

I want to spend tonight just looking in your eyes
I feel like a millionaire but I don't have a dime

It's like one step forward and two steps back
Love is like a hurricane
When you're with me I'm on track
We're riding on a crazy train
I'll be fine if you're mine at the end of the line

Let me love you
Won't you let me love you?
Won't you?
Oh, you got me loving you
Yeah, you got me loving you
Oh, you got me loving you
Girl, you got me loving you

Oh, you got me loving you
Girl, you got me loving you
Ah, you got me loving you
Girl, you got me loving you

One step forward and two steps back
You're love is like a hurricane
When you're with me I'm on track
We're riding on a crazy train
I'll be fine if you're mine at the end of the line
