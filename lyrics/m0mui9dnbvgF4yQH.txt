4am and once again
I am asked to leave this club in Tel Aviv
It's 4am and once again
I am asked to leave this club in Tel Aviv, oh

Everything I know deserts me now
When you open your legs
Everything I know deserts me now
When you open

I see it all
I see it all as plain as day
How people only give once they recieve
Soon there will come the very final pull of earth
And until then I will scream out your word

Everything I know deserts me now
When you open your legs
Everything I know deserts me now
When you open

Everything I know deserts me now
When you open your legs
Everything I know deserts me now
When you open
