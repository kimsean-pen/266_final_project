We won't give up
We'll wait just a little more
We'll bite our tongues
This pain that we can't ignore
Tell me a reason to carry on
When all I can see is the cracks in the wall

Maybe we're all insignificant
Pulling in different directions
To the edge of this prison
Are we living in hell?

Reluctant, never the culprit
A stick in the mud
We're so self-destructive
We're never gonna wake, never gonna wake up

Even if I say what's on my mind
I feel I'll waste my time
So please don't mind me
If I take my time

I've seen it all and I've felt nothing
Don't want no more, so show me your sins
I've seen it all and I've found nothing
When all I can see is the cracks in the wall

No direction like the path that I walk
Through the fading light of all we destroy
The siren sings that song we adore
And we won't wake up

If we can't break or scratch the surface
Redefine the words we obey
If we idolise our burdens
We're never gonna wake, never gonna wake up

Maybe we're all insignificant
Pulling in different directions
To the edge of this prison
Are we living in hell?

Our homes like galleries
We decorate the walls with our sins
Our lives so fragile
But we live like we're invincible

I've seen it all and I've felt nothing
Don't want no more, so show me your sins
I've seen it all and I've felt nothing
Don't want no more, so show me your sins
I've seen it all and I've found nothing
When all I can see is the cracks in the wall

(We know something's wrong)
But we still carry on

We won't give up
We'll wait just a little more
Tell me a reason
