I've been here lookin' dynamite
Alone against the wall
Girls like you give it all so cold
Talkin' cheap in a bathroom stall
And you look so smooth

You better tell me the truth
Would you trade me out for someone cool?
I know you better than you do
So put out your cigarette
And kiss me on the lips tonight
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back
Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've been on my knees and crawlin'
Back to you
It's coming all back to me

1983
I've got something that I've kept inside
And the blood is on the blade
You're there suckin' on your lollipop

Like you haven't aged a day
And it ain't so pretty when you're playin' cute
When your body's up against some fool
Does he feel it?
Cause I feel it
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back
Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've been on my knees and crawlin'
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
1983
The year I was born
I won't be ignored

So get your feet on the floor
I'm the only one
Are you afraid I still make you move?
Me and you
You and me

Let's go back to 1983
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back to 1983
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back

Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've been on my knees and crawlin'
Back to you

It's coming all back to me
1983
Me and you
You and me

Let's go back
Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've on my knees and crawlin'
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
1983
Uohh Uohh
1983
Uohh Uohh
1983
