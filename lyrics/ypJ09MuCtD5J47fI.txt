Feel no pleasure
Nor does it hurt
Chase the now, pull me out
Trailblazer
Feel no pleasure
Nor does it hurt
Chase the now, pull me out
Trailblazer

It's happening it's happening to us
And I'm used to it
The silent curtain's covering
In my head I'm losing
For sanity I'm begging
Questions that I've answered
Questions I've been asking
Curtains covering
What am I using?

Feel no pleasure
Nor does it hurt
Chase the now, pull me out
Trailblazer
Feel no pleasure
Nor does it hurt
Chase the now, pull me out
Trailblazer

I'm under it I'm under it again
And you ran ahead
The road in all its violence
In my head I'm moving
An opening, I'm coming
Questions that I've answered
Questions I've been asking
All the violence
What am I using?

Feel no pleasure
Nor does it hurt
Chase the now, pull me out
Trailblazer
Feel no pleasure
Nor does it hurt
Chase the now, pull me out
Trailblazer

Same anger
Same water
Same love
Same air
Run it over and over
Make a left turn, next time
Make a left turn, break out

Same anger
Same water
Same love
Same air
Run it over and over
Make a left turn, next time
Make a left turn, break out

Chase the now, pull me out
Trailblazer
Feel no pleasure

Chase the now, pull me out
Trailblazer
