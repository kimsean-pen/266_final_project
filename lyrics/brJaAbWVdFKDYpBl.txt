Come out to LA, come out to LA
Write a few songs
Maybe you could stay
Stay in Hollywood, stay in Hollywood, stay in Hollywood

Come out to LA, come out to LA
There's people you should meet
There's hands you should shake
Down in Hollywood now, down in Hollywood, down in Hollywood

It's my call to the faithful
You're not happy, happy, happy
Call to the faithful
If you're willing and able
Just be happy, happy, happy
I'm not happy, happy, happy

Come out to LA, come out to LA
Play a few shows
Maybe you could break
Down in Hollywood, down in Hollywood, down in Hollywood

Come out to LA, come out to LA
There's places to be seen
There's friends you should make
Down in Hollywood now, down in Hollywood, down in Hollywood

And I can't live without it no more
No I can't be without it O Lord
Praying that my feet don't fail me now
Keep the faith, keep the faith
I'm so full of doubt
Keep the faith, keep the faith

Come out to LA, come out to LA
Play a few shows
Maybe you could break
Down in Hollywood, down in Hollywood, down in Hollywood

Come out to LA, come out to LA
There's places to be seen
There's friends you should make
Here in Hollywood
Right here in Hollywood
Here in Hollywood

I can't live without it no more
No I can't be without it O Lord
Praying that my feet don't fail me now
Keep the faith, keep the faith
I'm so full of doubt
Keep the faith, keep the faith

No I'm not a believer no more
When all I hear is silence
Oh Lord
Praying I'm not lost
I'm not a believer
Keep the faith, keep the faith
Please let me be found
Keep the faith, keep the faith

Come out to LA
Things are going great
Sun is always shining
Everyones excited
You're in Hollywood now
You're in Hollywood

Come out to LA
Hoping that you make it
If you don't you'll do ur best to fake it
You're in Hollywood now
You're in Hollywood

It's my call to the faithful
We're not happy, happy, happy
Call to the faithful
In this city of angels
Can't be happy, happy, happy
I'm not happy, happy, happy

Come out to LA
No I'm not a believer
Keep the faith, keep the faith
Please let me be found
Keep the faith, keep the faith

Come out to LA, come out to LA
Write a few songs
Maybe you could stay
Stay in Hollywood, stay in Hollywood, stay in Hollywood

Come out to LA, come out to LA
There's people you should meet
There's hands you should shake
Down in Hollywood now, down in Hollywood, down in Hollywood

Come out to LA, come out to LA
Write a few songs
Maybe you could stay
Stay in Hollywood, stay in Hollywood, stay in Hollywood
