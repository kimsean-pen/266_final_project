Let me hear you say yeah, yeah

Let me hear you say yeah, yeah

No no, no no no no, no no no no
No no there's no limit!
No no, no no no no, no no no no
No no there's no limit!
No no limits, we'll reach for the sky
No valley to deep, no mountain to high
No no limits, wo'nt give up teh fight
We do what we want and we do it with pride

Let me hear you say yeah
Hard to the core, I feel the floor
When I'm on stage, yo, ya answer more
I'm on the edge, I know the ledge
I work real hard to collect my cash
Tick tick ticka tick take your time
When I'm goin' I'm goin' for mine
Open your ears and you will hear it
I tell you this 'cause there's no limit
No no, no no no no, no no no no
No no there's no limit!
No no, no no no no, no no no no,
No no there's no limit!
No no limits, we'll reach for the sky
No valley to deep, no mountain to high
No no limits, won't give up the fight
We do what we want and we do it with pride
Ow! hey yay yeah hey hey! Now, now
No no, hey yeah yeh hey hey! Now, now, hoo!
No limits allowed, cause there's much crowd
Microphone check as I choose my route
I'm playing on the road, I've got no fear
The south from my mouth is on record here
There never will be no mountain too high
Reach the top, touch the sky
They tried to diss me cause I sell out
I'm making techno and I am proud
No no limits, we'll reach for the sky
No valley to deep, no mountain to high
No no limits, won't give up the fight
We do what we want and we do it with pride
