Brothers in arms who share my fears,
Time to protect what you hold dear.
There's been a rise in new ideals,
Threatening to change the way we live.

Who knows what trouble's found a way,
Found a way to your door today.
Who knows what trouble's on its way,
On its way to intimidate.

All I want is a big red gun!
(Oh, yeah, yeah, oh)
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot at the setting sun!
(Oh, yeah, yeah, oh)
And all I want is a big red gun,
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot 'till the thrill is gone!
'Cause this is my right no matter the cost.
Get outta my sight when baby's got a big red gun!
(Oh, yeah, yeah, oh)
Baby's got a big red gun!
(Oh, yeah, yeah, oh)

Pride is a weapon in your hand.
Freedom awards the faithful man.
I hear the message loud and clear,
Straight from his lips into my ear.

And lord I just can't walk away,
Walk away from the enemy.
The law will never disagree,
On the target of my insecurities.

All I want is a big red gun!
(Oh, yeah, yeah, oh)
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot at the setting sun!
(Oh, yeah, yeah, oh)
And all I want a big red gun,
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot 'till the thrill is gone!
And how many lives will have to be lost,
To understand why my baby's got a big red gun?

Baby's got a big red gun!
Baby's got a big red gun!
Baby's got a big red gun!
Baby's got a big red gun!

We call them twisted and deranged,
(Baby's got a big red gun!)
But we gave them the keys to annihilate!
(Baby's got a big red gun!)
How long before the next one's in the ground?
(Baby's got a big red gun!)
So proud of all your history,
But history made a big mistake.
(Baby's got a big red gun!)
The judge jury stand before you now.
(Baby's got a big red gun!)

'Cause baby's got a big red gun!
Baby's got a big red gun!
Baby's got a big red gun!
Oh Momma what have I become?
