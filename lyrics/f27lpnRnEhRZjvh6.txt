I'm back for more and I got the cure
I know where I'm going for sure
What we threw away, we should've saved
Come and make my day

I said some things
That did not ring true (true)
And I said some things I did not mean to
Now, I'm back for more

'Cause I don't wanna lose this feeling
That you're giving me everytime I need it
Ain't looking for more
I need what you're giving me more, and more

I don't wanna lose this feeling
That you're giving me everytime I need it
I ain't looking for more
I need what you're givin' me more
(Give me more)

"Why can't we blow?"," Why don't we go?"
With our imperfections, we know
What we threw away, we should've saved
Come and make my day

I said some things
That did not ring true
And I said some things I did not mean
Now I'm back for more (more)

'Cause I don't wanna lose this feeling
That you're giving me everytime I need it
Ain't looking for more
I need what you're giving me more, and more

I don't wanna lose this feeling
That you're giving me everytime I need it
I ain't looking for more
I need what you're giving me more
(Give me more)

Don't wanna lose, don't, this feel
Don't, don't wanna lose, don't, this feel
I'm ready, come get me some more
I'm ready, I am ready

'Cause I don't wanna lose this feeling
That you're giving me everytime I need it
I ain't looking for more
I need what you're giving me more
Give me more

I don't wanna lose this feeling
(I'm ready, come get me)
Everytime I need it
(Give me some more)
Give me some more
I'm ready, come get me
More, give me some more

Don't wanna lose this feeling
Everytime I need it
More, I need it.
