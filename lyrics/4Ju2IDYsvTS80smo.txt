Is this the way that it feels inside
When you lose your mind, am I going crazy?
Is this the way that it feels to cry
A hundred times and never make a sound

Its all inside your head (don't let it get to you)
Its all inside your head (don't let it get you)
Its all inside your head (don't let it get to you)
Its all inside your head

Everytime I try to see, see outside the lines
I see you staring back at me
Telling me there's so much more
Than all I know

I give it everything everything of me (everything of me)
But I'm still buried deep underneath
The thoughts that cover me
I give it everything everything of me (everything of me)
But I'm still waiting for the light to show
If I stop breathing will you save me

Is this the way that it feels inside
When you lose your mind, am I going crazy?
I think I tried a hundred times
But I'm still here... six feet under

Its all inside your head (don't let it get to you)
Its all inside your head (don't let it get you)
Its all inside your head (don't let it get to you)
Its all inside your head

Why is it we bleed
Everytime we feel the need to free
If only we could see, what our futures hold
Is there still hope?

I give it everything everything of me (everything of me)
But I'm still buried deep underneath
The thoughts that cover me
I give it everything everything of me (everything of me)
But I'm still waiting for the light to show
If I stop breathing will you save me
Will you save me... Before I start suffocating...

I give it everything everything of me (everything of me)
But I'm still buried deep underneath
The thoughts that cover me
I give it everything everything of me
But I'm still waiting for the light to show
If I stop breathing will you save me
Will you save me... will you save me...
