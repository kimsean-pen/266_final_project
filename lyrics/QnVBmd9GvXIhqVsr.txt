My neck has been broke in the noose of life's rope
Through my loss of you I have found no hope
Slain the emotions, lifeless and blue
Destroying myself now

All for you
All for you
All for you

Remote recollections of tranquility
Terror grotesquely becoming of me
Unnamable joy when our blood once ran true
Destroying myself now

All for you
All you
All you
All you
All for you

All for you

All for you
All for you
