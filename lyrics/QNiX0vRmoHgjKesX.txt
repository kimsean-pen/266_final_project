Gold, gold, bones, bones
Under platinum headstones
Gold, gold, bones, bones
Under platinum headstones

You're so cold as you sit there alone
Selling your bright ideas
And paying someone to answer your phone
So this is life
Come home to kids and wife
After a day of twisting the knife
Til you get yours

There's blood on the tracks again
Do you buy,
Buy what you're selling them?

You know it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
I hate to see you drown in a sea of bills
Where did you bury all that
Precious, precious
Gold, gold, bones, bones
Under platinum headstones
Gold, gold, bones, bones
Under platinum headstones

You build empires, airplanes
And smog coated spires
Up to the last blank page
When the wildfires rage on the hills

There's blood on the tracks again
Do you buy,
Buy what you're selling them?

You know it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
I hate to see you drown in a sea of bills
Where did you bury, did you bury

Take my hand
Let's leave this place
Tonight we'll need our souls
And not that
Gold, gold, bones, bones
And all that worthless
Gold, gold, bones, bones
And all that useless

There's blood on the tracks again
Do you buy,
Buy what you're selling them?

You know it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
I hate to see you drown in a sea of bills
Where did you bury all that
Precious, precious
Gold, gold, bones, bones
Under platinum headstones
Gold, gold, bones, bones
And all that worthless gold
Gold, gold, bones, bones
And all that useless gold
Gold, gold, bones, bones
Where did you bury your heart?
