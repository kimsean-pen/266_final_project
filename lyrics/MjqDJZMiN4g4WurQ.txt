When the rain came
It washed us out to sea,
I'm holding what I love,
And she's holding on to me,

It's no surprise,
It brought me to my knees,
You're never really ready,
You're ready as can be,

The sun was coming up
We were sifting through the sand,
Looking for the pieces
Of our broken plans

It's gonna take a while,
We're gonna get it back,
We gotta carry on darling
We were built to last.

Changing tides,
Baby thats the hardest part of life,
Hold me tight
And we will move as one in the changing tides.

There's no doubt the beauty that we see,
Following the path, so much older than we
Lovers built it with their hands, walked it with their feet
Above the raging waters and the darkness underneath.

Changing tides,
Baby thats the hardest part of life,
Hold me tight
And we will move as one in the changing tides

And we will move as one in the changing tides

When the rain came
It washed us out to sea,
I'm holding what I love,
And she's holding on to me,

It's gonna take a while.
It's gonna come back,
We gotta carry on darling,
We were built to last.

Changing tides,
Baby thats the hardest part of life,
Hold me tight
And we will move as one in the changing tides

Changing tides,
And we will move as one in the changing tides
And we will move as one in the changing tides
