I am not sure is it how you would say yes
your room's still open but I didn't miss the steps
cause when I went nearby to see what I have missed
there was your doorman challenging me to confess

friend of mine
my old friend refire
my old friend well tide
my old friend of mine
but I get someone behind
oh

oh you gave me shelter say a fool you must not learn
why you've kept close will be left here to burn
me oldest of sisters she was the greatest one to earn
so I wrote her this letter in advance of my return

friend of mine
my old friend refire
oh my old friend well tide
old friend of mine
well I get someone behind
oh
as I get someone behind

friend of mine
my old friend refire
my old friend well tide
old friend of mine
ahahahah
