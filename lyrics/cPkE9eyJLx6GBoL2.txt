What I am supposed to be
In my life
In your life
In our life
In this life

In shut the door and close my sight
At the end of the day

It's not the way that it used to be
There's no way I'll see
The beginning of things to come
Trapped in the ways of the silent and weak

In my life
In your life
In our life
In this life

In shut the door and close my sight
At the end of the day
