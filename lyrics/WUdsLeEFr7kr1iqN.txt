When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darling, darling, stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh Stand
Stand by me

If the sky we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Oh and the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

Oh darling, darling, stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh stand
Stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble you just stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh stand
Stand by me
Stand by me

Oh darling darling stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh stand
Stand by me
Stand by me
Stand by me
Stand by me
