One more wasted morning
When I could be holding you
To my side somebody stop this joyless joy ride
I'm feeling older than my thirty-five years

One more cryptic message
Thinking that I might end it
Oh god, you must have woken up
To me saying that it's all too much
I'll take it easy with the morbid stuff

Honey I'm worried 'bout you
You're too much to lose
You're all that I have
And, honey I'm worried 'bout you
Put yourself in my shoes
You're all that I have so please don't die
Wherever you are tonight

All these pointless benders
With reptilian strangers
Oh my god you're so naive
You leave this world in a drunken heap
Who'll make the arrangements, baby, them or me?

Honey I'm worried 'bout you
You're too much to lose
You're all that I have
And, honey I'm worried 'bout you
Put yourself in my shoes
You're all that I have
You're all that I have
You're all that I have
So please don't die
Wherever you are tonight
