Overboard, going under
Still I'm dancing with the tide
Don't say a word,
Don't say a word
Don't you join the choir
We're all out of things to hide

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Don't say a word
I won't say a word
Oh the silence
Oh it's how we waste our time

Let's run Caroline
Suffer thoughts of these nights
At least that's what I heard, go easy
Pack our bags
Let's run Caroline
Let's take the circle life
While we still have the time, go easy
Run old Caroline

Close your eyes, ignore the sirens
Oh it's how we touch the sky
Don't make a sound, I won't make a sound
Stay with me a while
Too much darkness in the life

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Don't make a sound, I won't make a sound
Oh the silence
You're my only place to hide

Let's run Caroline
Suffer thoughts of these nights
At least that's what I heard, go easy
Pack our bags
Let's run Caroline
Let's take the circle life
Oh, we'll still have the time, go easy
Run old Caroline
Let's run Caroline
Suffer thoughts of these nights
At least that's what I heard, go easy
Pack our bags
Let's run Caroline
Let's take the circle life
While we still have the time, go easy
Run old Caroline

Just pack our bag and run old Caroline
