When I need it so bad
Why do you not come to defend
Is there any way to tell me
That you're gonna be a terrible friend

You remind me of a distant constellation
The way you color it up
But don't let me touch
So now you wanna know
Is that important
Well maybe now
And it just depends
It just depends

And when you come back uptown
Remember not to look for me there
I give you one more chance to make it better
But you don't seem to care

You pretend to be? by tradition
And now you cover it up
Tell me you don't
Well now you wanna know
Is nothing sacred?
And I dont wanna have to compare
They don't compare

When I see your friends
They say it's in my head
All my friends seem to think
You might leave me for dead

I don't remember if its coastal complication
It keeps leaving it out
And color it up
And if you wanna know
I won't confront you
With all the stupid things
That you said
