I walked upon
The earth alone
I was torn away, I have fallen
But never bow

'Till my day arrives
I will learn how to live
Dying but standing
On my feet

For someone inside an empty dream,
To find an exit takes lots of proving to do

I'll never forget,
I saw it in your eyes
You gave me the fire
That would break me out
Break me out
Break me out
Just break me out

I let the rain
Erase my name
Because now the struggle has a face
My fate unfolds
It's all getting clear
Lightning the darkness that once set in

I closed my fists and
Held it high
Forgave what haunts me
This time it's do it or die

I'll never forget,
I saw it in your eyes
You gave me the fire
That would break me out
Break me out
Break me out
Just break me out

I'll never forget,
I saw it in your eyes
You gave me the fire
That would break me out
Break me out
Break me out
Just break me out

I'll never forget,
I saw it in your eyes
You gave me the fire
That would break me out
Break me out
Break me out
Break me out!

I'll never forget,
I saw it in your eyes
You gave me the fire
That would break me out
Break me out
Break me out
Just break me out

(I'll never forget)
(I saw it in your eyes)
I'll never forget
Break me out
(Break me out)
(Break me out)
I'll never forget
Out
Break me out
Break me out
Break me
Break me
