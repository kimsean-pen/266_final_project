We are lovers through and through and though
We made it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want to put you on

I've been searchin' for someone
To satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration
Be the real love that I need

Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love

Ooh, when I met you I just knew
That you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one

So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspirations
Lead me to want some real love

Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
I got to have a real love

Love so true and oh baby, I thought that your love was true
I thought you were the answer to the questions in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stay strong maybe I'll find my real love

So I try my best and pray to God
He'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me
Towards a love my heart can feel

Now, I know I can be faithful
I can be your all in all
I'll give you good lovin' through
The summer time, winter, spring and fall

Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love

Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love

You see I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go
(Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love)
Been around the world and high and low and still I'll never know
(Someone to set my heart free)
How it feels to have a real love 'cause it seems it's not around
(Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love)
Gotta end it in this way because it seems he can't be found
Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searchin' for a real love, real love
