No time to see where you went, Abegail
Moving throughout dallow water to spill

then crash a wave torn apart on its sail
hope i will see the end one maybe will

open eyes to see at all

I've known you at six feet tall

no time to see where you'll drift, Abegail

wait for

wait for me

wait for
wait for me
wait for
wait for me
