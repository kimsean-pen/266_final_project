Watching inhabitions
Falling to the floor
Notice how you locked the door
What would you love to do?

Here in this hotel room
Together and alone
I want you to put on a show
What would you love to do?
What you love to say?
What would you love?

Princess,
I just wanna witness
Watch you severing the velvet
I won't say the word - say the word

Princess,
I just wanna witness
Watch you severing the velvet
I won't say the word - say the word

Watching in the mirror
The way you touch yourself
Your hips to your fingertips
What would you love to do?

Don't be so impatient
Don't lose self control
I'll make up the rules as we go
What would you love to do?
What would you love to say?
What would you love?

Princess,
I just wanna to witness
Watch you severing the velvet
I won't say the word - say the word

Princess,
I just wanna witness
Watch you severing the velvet
I won't say the word - say the word

Princess
I just wanna witness
Watch you slip right out of that dress
I won't say the word - say the word

Princess,
I just wanna witness
Watch you severing the velvet
I won't say the word - say the word

Princess,
I just wanna witness
Watch you slip right out of that dress
I wont say the word
No I won't say the word
No I won't say the word - say the word
