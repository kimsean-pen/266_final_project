What is this?
It's kind of like...
All my body starts to shiver.
Worries will no longer have.
Oh, I've never felt like this before.
Got to let it go.
I'll shout it out
I will sing it from the heart:
Oo-hoo-oo-oo
Oo-hoo-oo-oo-oo-hoo-oo

This is right,
This is good:
Expressions of elation,
A state of mind of which I'll try
To re-echo from the start.
Come on!
Shout it out,
And release it from the heart:
Oo-hoo-oo-oo
Oo-hoo-oo-oo-oo-hoo-oo
Oo-hoo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo, hoo-oo

This is what,
This is what,
This is what it all comes down to:
When you need,
When you need,
When you need to let it all through:
Shout it out,
And release it from the heart:
Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo...

(Children singing "Ba-pa-da-da-da-da-da...)

What is this?
It's kind of like...
Is the echo from the start?
