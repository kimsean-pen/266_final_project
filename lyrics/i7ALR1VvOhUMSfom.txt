On a sunny day, I wake up
and the light drains in
and automatically, I reach out
and I feel the warm weight on my fingers

Yellow with the strain, I guess, I let up
kick the rubble on the eightfold
I see myself, am I dreaming again 'cause it feels like

all my life I've been so sure I'm alright

but sometimes i'm lonely
and the only things I care about
fall apart like macaroni
only for today

I let it fall away
and come down
Let it dress me up
and as it I knew it would, there's no doubt
just a troubadour tied to my mooring
staring at my chains again, they're cut off
but I won't get out
I see myself as a marionette, yeah it feels like

All my life I've been so sure I'm alright
banging my drum, blow the fife, circle the pain all night

but sometimes I'm lonely
and the stupid things I think about
call my name
Seems like I'm only
waiting for today

you can live your life this way, it's true
while the old folk pray for tomorrow I'm waiting for today

all my life I've been so sure I'm alright
