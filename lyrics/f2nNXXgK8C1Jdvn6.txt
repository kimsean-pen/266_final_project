Do you believe in Heaven above?
Do you believe in love?
Don't tell a lie, don't be false or untrue
It all comes back to you

Open fire on my burning heart
I've never been lucky in love
My defenses are down, a kiss or a frown
I can't survive on my own

If a girl walks in and draws her name in my heart
I'll turn and run away
Everyday we've all been led astray
It's hard to be lucky in love

It gets in your eyes, it's making you cry
Don't know what to do, don't know what to do
You're looking for love calling heaven above

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now

Empty dreams can only disappoint
In a room behind your smile
Don't give up, don't give up
You can be lucky in love

It gets in your eyes, it's making you cry
Don't know what to do, don't know what to do
You're looking for love calling heaven above

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now
Please send me an angel
Won't you send me an angel
Right now

Oh, send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right
