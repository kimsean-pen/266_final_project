With aversion,
This insertion came so swiftly.
Cut the cord,
From this day forward we'll be drifting.
No direction, no affection,
Watch the soul dive.
You're dissected, resurrected,
Still don't know why.
This illness is like a monster that is eating us alive.

Hold on!
Be strong!
So right!
So wrong!
With all of our senses!
All of our defenses!
Hold on!
Be strong!

New arrival, our survival,
Still not certain.
What's a virtue?
Where do you go to when you're hurting?
It's a weakness,
It's a sickness in the gene pool.
Show no mercy,
People here say "kill the damned fool".
This illness is like a monster that is eating us alive.

Hold on!
Be strong!
So right!
So wrong!
With all of our senses!
All of our defenses!
Hold on!
Be strong!

My soul, blood, run...
Don't ever let me go, no!
Don't ever let me go, no!
Never never let you go, no!
I'll never let you go, no!

Hold on!
Be strong!
So right!
So wrong!
With all of our senses!
All of our defenses!
Hold on!
Be strong!
