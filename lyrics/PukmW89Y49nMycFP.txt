Ashes of the innocent
The end for you and me
Darkness, screams of agony
Are begging, set me free (come set me free!)

Mourning all your loved ones
As their bodies turn to stone
Violence, hate and agony
Are what we've grown to know

Hold me, show me
Bring me to my knees
So as the fire burns and the tables turn
We'll never rest in peace
Rest In Peace

(Fuck You, Push it!)

Ashes of the innocent
Remind me of the past
Taking scars of victory
The time has passed too fast (it's passed too fast!)
Singing broken melodies
Like shards of broken glass
Ripping through my memory
These scars won't ever last

Hold me, show me
Bring me to my knees (bring me to my knees...)
So as the fire burns and the tables turn
We'll never rest in peace (never rest in peace)

Hold me, show me
Bring me to my knees (bring me to my knees...)
So as the fire burns and the tables turn
We'll never rest in peace (never rest in peace...)

Ashes of the innocent
The end for you and me
Darkness, screams of agony
Are begging, set me free

Hold me, show me
Bring me to my knees (bring me to my knees...)
So as the fire burns and the tables turn
We'll never rest in peace (never rest in peace)

Hold me, show me
Bring me to my knees (bring me to my knees...)
So as the fire burns and the tables turn
We'll never rest in peace (never rest in peace)

Rest In Peace!
