Scum of the earth, come on

Yeah, run and kill, I destroy the will
A hero that doesn't exist, yeah
Smoking gun, well, I am the one
A bullet hole in your fist, yeah

Hey, I'm breathing, hey, I'm bleeding, hey, I'm screaming
Scum of the earth, come on
Hey, I'm breathing, hey, I'm bleeding, hey, I'm screaming
Scum of the earth, come on

Yeah, wake up dead, bleeding red
A world that doesn't exist, yeah
Heaven waits with the gates
Rusting in the mist, yeah

Yeah, hey, I'm breathing, hey, I'm bleeding, hey, I'm screaming
Scum of the earth, come on
Hey, I'm breathing, hey, I'm bleeding, hey, I'm screaming
Scum of the earth, come on

Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go

Yeah, run and kill, I destroy the will
A hero that doesn't exist, yeah
Smoking gun, well, I am the one
A bullet hole in your fist, yeah

Hey, I'm breathing, hey, I'm bleeding, hey, I'm screaming
Scum of the earth, come on
Hey, I'm breathing, hey, I'm bleeding, hey, I'm screaming
Scum of the earth, come on

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, scum of the earth
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, scum of the earth
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, scum of the earth
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, scum of the earth
