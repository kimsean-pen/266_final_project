Like a flame you touched my life
Felt so good felt so right
Time goes fast love grows slow

It's so hard to let go

I'll remember, I'll remember
Now I've got to go
I'll remember, I'll remember
Oh, I love you so

You gave so much, didn't ask why
I can't explain so please don't cry

We took the chances, broke the line

Now we're running out of time

I'll remember, I'll remember
Now I've got to go
I'll remember, I'll remember
Oh, I love you so

We shot the dice
Played the game
Did it all for love
Do it all again

We shot the dice
Played the game
Did it all for love
Do it all again

Oh, so much I want to say
Now it's time to go away
Now forever you're with me (yet)
You're in my soul, I won't forget

I'll remember, I'll remember
Now I've got to go
I'll remember, I'll remember
Oh, I love you so

We shot the dice
Played the game
Did it all for love
Do it all again

We shot the dice
Played the game
Did it all for love
Do it all again

I'll remember, I'll remember
Now I've got to go
I'll remember, I'll remember
Oh, I love you so

We shot the dice
Played the game
Did it all for love
Do it all again
