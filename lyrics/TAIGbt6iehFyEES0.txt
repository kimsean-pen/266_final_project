Nowhere girl
You're living in a dream
Nowhere girl
You stay behind the scenes
Nowhere girl
You never go outside
Nowhere girl
Because you prefer to hide

Every day, every night
In that all old familiar light
You hang up when I call you at home
And I try to get through
Ant I try to talk to you
But there's something stopping me from getting through

Nowhere girl
What you had you need
Nowhere girl
All functional and neat
Nowhere girl
In self-imposed exile
Nowhere girl
A martyr-like denial

Every day, every night
In that all old familiar light
You hang up when I call you at home
And I try to get through
Ant I try to talk to you
But there's something stopping me from getting through

Every day, every night
In that all old familiar light
You hang up when I call you at home
And I try to get through
Ant I try to talk to you
But there's something stopping me from getting through
