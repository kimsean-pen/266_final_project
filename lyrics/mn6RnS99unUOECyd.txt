I know a spell
That would make you help
Write about love, it could be in any tense
But it must make sense

I know a trick
Forget that you are sick
Write about love, it could be in any form
Hand it to me in the morning

I hate my job, I'm working way too much
Every day I'm stuck in an office
At one o'clock, I take my lunch up on the roof
The city's right below, I'll ride upon a man
He's intellectual and he's hot but he understands

The seconds move on
(If you watch the clock)
And the sky grows dark
(If you're looking up)

And the girls move from thrill to thrill
On the tightrope walk
(On the tightrope walk)

I hate my job, I'm working way too much
(Every day I'm stuck in an office)
At one o'clock, I take my lunch up on the roof
The city's right below, I'll ride upon a man
He's intellectual and he's hot but he understands

I know the way
(So you know the way)
Get on your skinny knees and pray
(Maybe not today)

You've got to see the dream through the windows
And the trees of your living room
(Of your living room)
You've got to see the dream through the windows
And the trees of your living room
