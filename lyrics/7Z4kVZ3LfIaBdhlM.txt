LIke a god in my head
Low day
Places in my veins
What a pain

Morning hits my consciousness
It woke me up today

I'm astray
I'm astray
I can't tell who is here
To go today, tonight

Last night in my head
Stay in bed
Wait for another fall
How long

Morning hits my consciousness
It woke me up in haze

I'm astray
I'm astray
I can't tell who is here
To go today, tonight

I'm astray
I'm astray
I can't tell who is here
To go today, tonight
