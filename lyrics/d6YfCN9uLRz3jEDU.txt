Your scars where still showing when I first met you, baby
From all the wrong she had done to you
And I came along and applied a little loving
Slowly but surely I brought u through

Now she's back to recinlde that old flame
She's got a different angle, baby
But she's playing the same old game

Baby, don't be the victim of a foolish heart
Don't let her lies get next to you
She's just trying to tear us apart
And she's trying to make, to make me a victim too

Now I know she come around here everytime I leave
Cos she knows she's still on your mind, on your mind
See, even a wise man jumps in misery somewhere down the line
But only a fool will jump the second time
Our affair is growing stronger every day
Don't let her... steal our happiness away

Don't be the victim of a foolish heart

Don't let her lies get next to you
She's just trying to tear us apart
And she's trying to make, to make me a victim too

Now she's back to recinlde that old flame
She's got a different angle, baby
But she's playing the same old game

Baby, don't be the victim of a foolish heart
Don't let her lies get next to you
Ooh, she's just trying to tear us apart
And she's trying to make, to make me her victim too

Im not gonna let her make
Im not gonna let her um
Im not gonna let her make
Im not gonna let her um
...
Cant you see what she's doing to you boy?

Don't be a victim
