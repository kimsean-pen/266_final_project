A bitter battle brewing
Engulfed in flames
A game for many
Others feel the pain

Seek a side for cover
Attack your enemy
Many spit their hatred
Right across the face

False deception
There's no order
Where's the progress?

Nothing functions, nothing functions
Nothing functions, nothing's working
Nothing functions, nothing functions
Where's it gone to? Was it worth it?

We lose sight
We chose sides
Delusions
We lose sight

False deception, there's no order
Where's the progress? Where's it gone to?
Nothing functions, nothing functions
Nothing's working â€“ Was it worth it?
