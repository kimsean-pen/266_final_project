On the following friday as I turned out the light
Grandma' came and knocked at My door
"Wake up King, wake up My dear
I am gonna show You about the house of Amon"

It is time for tea, it is time again

"Even Your mother is present
We made her sleep in My rocking chair"
At first I felt really scared but there was no reason to
As I saw the knife sneaking out from
Grandmother's dress
Then it cut a tiny wound in My mother's little hand

It is time for tea, it is time again

Guitar solo: Pete

Blood was running into the tea pot, then I heard "THEM" laugh
"A bit of this in a cup of tea, is what it takes to set "THEM" free
You will hear "THEM" telling stories from far beyond this earth"
What I saw and what I heard made me want to stay and learn

I really hope this dream will never end,
it's hard to describe the kind of
feeling that went on in My mind
A paradise

Guitar solo: Pete, Guitar solo: Andy

Hearing "THEIR" stories and feeling "THEIR" warmth
We laughed with tears in our eyes
From the first cup of tea, to the last drop of blood
Nothing seemed to matter at all anymore
My Mother? She didn't exist to me,
Oh I felt so heavenly

It is time for tea, it is time again
