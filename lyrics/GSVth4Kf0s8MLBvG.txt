(Verse)
Sorry if I'm speaking out of line,
But I don't want this night to be over,
I don't want it to end.

Cause it seems like when our worlds collide
It just don't feel right not to hold you,
It's getting hard to be friends.

(Pre-Chorus)
Do you feel what I feel the closer that we get
It's almost like there's a force that we can't resist.

(Chorus)
Baby, tell me why, why you wanna stop
What's happening inside it's bigger than you and me,
It's like we're fighting gravity.
Even if we run we'll be like a shadow
Running from the sun, something you can't escape.
It's gonna pull you back to me.
You'll be fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting gravity.

(Verse)
Baby, look up at the universe,
Some things attract to each other,
Like the planets and stars.

Even though I can't read your mind
You know you think about it all the time,
So what's keeping us apart?

(Pre-Chorus)
Do you feel what I feel the closer that we get
It's almost like there's a force that we can't resist.

(Chorus)
Baby, tell me why, why you wanna stop
What's happening inside it's bigger than you and me,
It's like we're fighting gravity.
Even if we run we'll be like a shadow
Running from the sun, something you can't escape.
It's gonna pull you back to me.
You'll be fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting gravity.

(Bridge)
You gotta hold, you gotta hold, you gotta hold on me,
You gotta hold, you gotta hold, you gotta hold on me,
You gotta hold, you gotta hold, you gotta hold on me,
You gotta hold, you gotta hold, you gotta hold, like gravity.

(Chorus)
Baby, tell me why, why you wanna stop
What's happening inside it's bigger than you and me,
It's like we're fighting gravity.
Even if we run we'll be like a shadow
Running from the sun, something you can't escape.
It's gonna pull you back to me.
You'll be fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting gravity
