I'm on a highway full of red lights
I've lost so many long nights
Felt words that cut like knives
I know, I know they're gonna
Say what they wanna
I know they're gonna
Say what they want, yeah (want, want)

But I feel it changing
I can taste it, I'm on the wave and
I won't waste it
I have been patient
But I'm not waiting anymore
Not anymore, no

I'm gonna dance on broken glass, ey
On broken glass
And I'm gonna make that ceiling crash, ah
That ceiling crash

So what? Still got knives in my back
So what? So I'm tied to the tracks, yeah
I'm gonna dance on broken glass
And here I go, here I go, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
Yeah here I go, here I go
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
Yeah here I go, here I go

So I bet on me and my own heartbeat
When all the odds are piling
Like bricks around my feet
You know, you know it's more than
More than just for me
You know it's worth it
I still believe, yeah yeah

I'm gonna dance on broken glass, ey
On broken glass
And I'm gonna make that ceiling crash, ah
That ceiling crash

So what? Still got knives in my back
So what? So I'm tied to the tracks, yeah
I'm gonna dance on broken glass
And here I go, here I go

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
Yeah here I go, here I go
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
And here I go, here I go

Through to the other side, baby I'll survive (oh oh)
'Cause you know I'm a fighter (oh oh oh)
Through to the other side, baby I'm on fire (oh oh)
'Cause you know I'm a survivor (oh oh oh)
Through to the other side, baby I'll survive (oh oh)
'Cause you know I'm a fighter (oh oh oh)
Through to the other side, baby I'm on fire (on fire, fire)

Wooh
I'm gonna dance on broken glass, ey
On broken glass
And I'm gonna make that ceiling crash, ah
That ceiling crash
So what? Still got knives in my back
So what? So I'm tied to the tracks
Yeah I'm gonna dance on broken glass
And here I go, here I go

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
Yeah here I go, here I go
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
And here I go, here I go
