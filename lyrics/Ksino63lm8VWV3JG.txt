A man is not his song
A song is a promise
If a man is just his song
Then can the song be beyond us?
How we make it up
And it sends in deep elation
Eventually it'll let you down
By believing in standing ovation
Song won't lift up if
Made by revenge so oboe sweet
I will will it
To add up to more than you or me

Cuz a man is not his song
And I'm not a story
But I wanna sing along
If he's singing it for me
That filament that flies by
And it brings yellow light
Of those yellow summers back
By coconut palm and snowy pine
I've heard years pass
Through my ears to hear otherwise
We all believe in old melodies
I carry tunes around like they carry me

A man is not his song
Though we all wanna sing along
We've all heard those old melodies

Like they're singing right to me
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed

More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed

More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
More than a melody's needed
