I open my eyes, everything shines
We swim as the breeze blows down the coast
Down on my luck, breathing my last
Dirty your hands carry me home

Red sky turning round
Black rain falling down
If you've got love
You'd better hope that that's enough

Sandstorm cuts your skin
Black kites circling
If you've got love
You'd better hope that that's enough

We came from the south to Lebanon's shore
Folded our clothes, dive into peace
The blackest of seas glittering red
Lit by the fire over our heads

Red sky turning round
Black rain falling down
If you've got love
You'd better hope that that's enough
Sandstorm cuts your skin
Songbirds circling
If you've got love
You'd better hope that that's enough
You'd better hope that that's enough
