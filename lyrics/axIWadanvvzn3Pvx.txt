Oh ho oh ho ooh
Tell me the story
Tell me the legend
Tell me the tales of war
Tell me just one time
What it was like before, oh
Bring me the feelin'
Right in that moment
When a heart for battle cries
Find me the treasure
Where the legend lies
If I were a noble ancient knight
I'll stand by your side (side)
To rule and fight
It will always feel the same
When I call out your name
Ninja survive (In dreams I walk by your side)
Oh, ninja survive (With you there's no need to hide)
A handful of sayings
Are more than a reason
For me to feel this way
I'd like to be near you
Maybe for just one day, oh ho
So tell me the legend
Tell me the story
Tell me the tales of war
Tell me just one time
What it was like before, ooh oh
If I were a noble ancient knight
I'll stand by your side (Knight)
To rule and fight
It will always feel the same
When I call out your name
Ninja survive (In dreams I walk by your side)
Oh, ninja survive (With you there's no need to hide)
Hide
If I were a noble ancient knight
I'll stand by your side (Ancient knight)
To rule and fight
It will always feel the same
When I call out your name
Ninja survive (In dreams I walk by your side)
Oh, ninja survive (With you there's no need to hide)
Oh Lord Lord Lord
By your side, yeah (In dreams I walk by your side)
Ninja survive (With you there's no need to hide)
