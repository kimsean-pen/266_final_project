Cracks in the ceiling, crooked pictures in the hall.
Countin' and breathin', I'm leaving here tomorrow.
They don't know, I never do you any good.
Laughing is easy, I would if I could.

Ain't gon' worry, just live till you die.
Wanna drown with nowhere to fall into the arms of someone.
There's nothin' to save, that I know.
You live till you die.

(Live till you die,) I know.
(Live till you die,) I know.
(Live till you die,) I know.
(Live till you die.)

Losin' all feelin', and I couldn't get away.
Countin' and breathin', disappearing in the fade.
They don't know, I never do you any good.
Stoppin' and stayin', I would if I could.

Ain't gon' worry, just live till you die.
Wanna drown with nowhere to fall into the arms of someone.
There's nothin' to save, I know.
You live till you die.

(Live till you die,) I know.
(Live till you die,) I know.
(Live till you die,) I know.
(Live till you die.)
