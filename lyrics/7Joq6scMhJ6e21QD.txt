I'm in love with somebody
Found someone who completes me
I'm in love with somebody
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
And it's not you!

Feed my finger,
Whatcha gonna do?
See these lips are all done talkin' to you
I don't mean to bruise your ego
But I've had you nailed down for so long
I don't see your name on my tattoo

Hope you understand
It's been a long time coming
It's for the best
No offense

I'm in love with somebody
Found someone who completes me
I'm in love with somebody
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
And it's not you!

I know who you think you are
Sorry I've turned you on
But I'm kissing you off
Your lines are whiskey and cigarettes
They're not enough to make me forget
I got someone who has raised the bar
I've heard it all before
Stop spinnin' your wheels
You'll use the door
No hard feelings

I'm in love with somebody
Found someone who completes me
I'm in love with somebody
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
And it's not you!

You probably never been shot down before
You probably never been shot down before
I'll try and make it easier

I'm in love with somebody
Found someone who completes me
I'm in love with somebody
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
And it's not you!
It's not you!
It's not you, yeah!
