So, I think it's time
To face yourself again
It's not too late
There's always time
To steal yourself
What are you looking for
We both are free
In the here and now
So take my hand
And don't fear what you find
On your own
Open up, give it up

Your life will be brighter
Your days will be longer
But come on, you feel it
Of flesh and blood, give it up, go
It's only illusion
A miracle darling
Give it to the knowing
Of flesh and blood, give it up, go

Truth, it's just as real
As your dream at night
So far away
It's all around
Forget yourself
Cast a sacred grain
We start today
Open up, give it up, go

Your life will be brighter
Your days will be longer
But come on, you feel it
Of flesh and blood, give it up, go
It's only illusion
A miracle darling
Give it to the knowing
Of flesh and blood, give it up, go

Your life will be brighter
Your days will be longer
But come on, you feel it
Of flesh and blood, give it up, go

It's only illusion
A miracle darling
Give it to the knowing
Of flesh and blood, give it up, go
