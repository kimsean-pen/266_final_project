You even taught me how I shouldn't be
You even taught me everything I won't need
You even taught me all the paths that I shouldn't go

I hope you don't missunderstand
These words were not said to offend
It's a different perspective
That probably you also taught me

All of it was hidden inside my heart
And I wouln't let it out

But you were too much for yourself

You even taught me how I shouldn't be
You even taught me everything I won't need
You even taught me all the paths that I shouldn't go

I know that the time goes by
I know that this is the price of trying to be
As best as you can

I know, and this comes from my vault
I know that this is not your fault

This is not your fault! This is not your fault!
This is not your fault! This is not your fault!

You even taught me how I shouldn't be
You even taught me everything I won't need
You even taught me all the paths that I shouldn't go

You taught me everything
You taught me everything

This is not your fault! This is not your fault!
This is not your fault! This is not your fault!

You taught me everything

This is not your fault! This is not your fault!
This is not your fault! This is not your fault!

You taught me everything
