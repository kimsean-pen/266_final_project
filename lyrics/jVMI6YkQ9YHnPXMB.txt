Over paralyzed pressure above structural obstructions,
Celestial reign denied. Our worlds collide,
Loathing parallel perceptions. Renouncing vicarious redemption.
Avoid the fall from grace. A view replaced.
Silence consumed us. The bloodline.

Abhor the absolute;
Created and thrown under.

Trying to recover the flesh. Casting spells upon swines.
Reject reviled wisdom. No powers are divine.
Moving mountains, splitting seas,
False hope never beckoned me.

No gods, no masters, no rulers, no kings;
What you reject, I bring.
