If everything had come true
there'd be nothing left to do
wander the halls, meet outside ourselves
bring up the nightwatch
to wake up the king's nurse
she could chase us through the kitchen
asleep...

our lord is so neurotic
he's a heart-broken jock
our lord is so neurotic
he's a heart though

now lately I've been worrying
that it might just be okay
now lately I've been worrying
that it might just be okay
you know lately I've been worrying
you know lately I've been worrying
you know lately I've been worrying
you know lately...

I black out, just to keep it real
I black out, ain't no big deal
I black out, dive into the sun
I black out, straight-jacket fun

dumb just like a genius
dumb just like Jesus
dumb just like I need
your dumb, now you can kick it

I black out, just to keep it real
I black out, ain't no big deal
I black out, I black out, I black out
it ain't no big deal
