You said that I don't care, but of course I do
How come when I'm alone, I only think of you
Only been in love, maybe once or twice
But now that I've had just a taste you've got me so enticed

Used to feel those words that you spoke over me, but now I don't
I used to feel those powder blue eyes stare through mine, but now I guess I won't
And now I don't know, if you want me so, I guess I'll go

You floor me with that style, and if I had a choice
I wouldn't slip up everytime that I hear your voice
And though it doesn't work, I try desperately
To become this great ugly root to a perfect tree

I used to feel those words that you spoke over me, but now I don't
I used to feel those powder blue eyes stare through mine, but now I guess I won't
And now I don't know, if you want me so, I guess I'll go
