Easy lover
She'll get a hold on you, believe it
She's like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees

She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see

She's the kind of girl you dream of
Dream of keeping hold of
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it

She will play around and leave you
Leave you and deceive you
You better forget it
Oh, you'll regret it, ooh yeah

Now don't try to change her, so leave it, leave it
Get out quick cos seeing is believing
It's the only way you'll ever know, oh

She's an easy lover
She'll get a hold on you, believe it
She's like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees

She's an easy lover
She will take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see

You're the one that wants to hold her
Hold her and control her
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it

'Cause she'll say there's no other
Till she finds another
You better forget it
Oh, you'll regret it

And don't try to change her, just leave it, just leave it
You're not the only one, seeing is believing
It's the only way you'll ever know, oh

Don't try to change her, just leave it, leave it
You're not the only one, ooh seeing is believing
It's the only way you'll ever know, oh

She's an easy lover
She'll get a hold on you, believe it
She's like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
I'm just trying to make you see
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
