Voiceless up to this day
The shock was really strong
No words my mouth could say
Restraint, but protected behing the asylum's gates
From the screams and the tears of the dead

Erased mistakes
Like victims disposed
No names
No traces
Cases closed

The shock was really strong
No words my mouth could say
Disturbing thoughts
Confessions that make me shiver

But I cannot stop the voices in my head
Anger still lurks within

Confessions of a serial killer
The flashbacks make me shiver
Confessions of a serial killer
Make the voices stop

Confessions of a serial killer
The flashbacks make me shiver
Confessions of a serial killer
Make the voices stop
Make the voices stop
