There's a mask in the drawer
That you wore once before
There's a coat you're painting on
Once it dries it never runs

Everyone will applaud
Every lie you afford
Lose your face to mask your pride
Using space to fill your mind

There's a light that you hold
Made of silver and gold
Reflects the way you feel inside
You run away, but you can't hide

There's a mask in the drawer
That you wore once before
There's a coat you're painting on
Once it dries it never runs
