He gives a nervous smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares
She can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been goin' on
She says

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand

Everything will be alright, he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid that what they've been doing is not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand

He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tries to explain, "It's you that makes me happy,"
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Don't you let go baby
Don't you don't you let go
Can I get quick dance baby
Don't you let go baby
Whatever happens, just don't let go of my hand
Thank you, man!
Thank you, Carlos!
