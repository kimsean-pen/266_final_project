Stare at the dark foreboding walls
I turn and look away
The fear it haunts me
While I sleep
(Sleep)

Now as life is torn apart
The walls they lead the way
This tortured journey
Almost at the end...
(At the end)

Look at time upon the skies
I turn and look away
The truth it haunts me
Wake me from sleep
(Sleep)
