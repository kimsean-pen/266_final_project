Where you gonna go in your winter coat?
I wonder what you're hiding cause it's not too cold
It's already too late
Somebody's gonna get you

And if I hold you too tight
Someone else won't get to
Oh, wouldn't you know it?
I keep it rolling
Considering no one
Punching the path
Facing the blast
A moment [?]
But you still never know
Where your soul is attached
Oh, wouldn't you know it?
Oh, wouldn't you know it?

I'm so confused
I can't move
I can't even try

I hope you find someone to lose
Someday

And where you gonna go
Sweating in a sweater
You got too much style
You're never alone
Some day they're gonna get you

I hope you find someone to lose
Someday
I hope you find
I hope you find someone to lose
Someday

I hope you find
I hope you find someone to lose
Someday
