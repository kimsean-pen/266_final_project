Are you with us, darling?
Cause you treat it like a game
And you mess yourself up
It's such a shame, such a shame
You got issues, darling
Cause you wasted all away
You're full of yourself
It's all in vain, all in vain

And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart...

(Oh, Oh)
Cause everytime is the last time
(Oh, Oh)
And I'm kickin' myself just trying to be understanding
(Oh, Oh)
Tell me how can you fake that?
(Oh)
You're leaving me waitin' and acting like I'm so demanding
(Oh, Oh)

Cause it's never your fault
When you're keepin' your knees clean
And 'sorry's below you
Its always me, always me

If it breaks your heart
When you break my heart...

(Oh, oh)
Cause everytime is the last time
(Oh, oh)
And I'm kicking myself just trying to be understanding
(Oh, oh)
Tell me how did you think that?
(Oh, oh)
You're leaving me waitinf ans acting like I'm so demanding
(Oh, oh)

You told me you could change your ways
You collecting scars but you look away
You promised me you could make it better
You told me you won't be the same
But your eyes stay shut and my screams fall faint
I only wanted to make it better
Make it better
Make you better

And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart...

(Oh, oh)
Cause everytime is the last time
(Oh, oh)
And I'm kicking myself just trying to be understanding
(Oh, oh)
Tell me how did you think that?
(Oh)
You're leaving me waiting and acting like I'm so demanding
(Oh, oh)

(Oh, oh)
Cause everytime is the last time
(Oh, oh)
And I'm kicking myself just trying to be understanding
(Oh, oh)
Tell me how did you think that?
(Oh)
You're leaving me waiting and acting like I'm so demanding
(Oh, oh)
