Ohhh

I'll be on the next next train
See you at dawn
A picture of us in the rain
Look and it's gone

Do you want my love
Or do you want something
I can't give you?
How can I be sure
That what you said before
Had been true?

Ohhh
Will we ever be the same?
Ohhh
Will we ever?

Burning with these mixed emotions
Thinking of you
Are you out there somewhere?
Burning with these mixed emotions
Thinking of you
Are you out there somewhere?

Looking at the red red sky
Thinking it through
27 Days and nights
Since I saw you

Am I just a fool
For wanting all of your attention?
So tell me if I'm right
Or heading in the wrong direction?

Ohhh
Will we ever be the same?
Ohhh
Will we ever?

Burning with these mixed emotions
Thinking of you
Are you out there somewhere?
Burning with these mixed emotions
Thinking of you
Are you out there somewhere?

Don't leave me with these mixed emotions
And dreaming of you
Are you out there somewhere?
Burning with these mixed emotions
Thinking of you
Hope you're out there somewhere

Is our love
Is our love an illusion?
Will it fly away?
Is our love
Is our love an illusion?
Watch it fly away

Is our love
Is our love an illusion?
Is our love
Is our love an illusion?

Ohhh
Ohhh

Burning with these mixed emotions
Thinking of you
Are you out there somewhere?
Burning with these mixed emotions
Thinking of you
Are you out there somewhere?

Don't leave me with these mixed emotions
And dreaming of you
Are you out there somewhere?
Burning with these mixed emotions
Thinking of you
Hope you're out there somewhere
