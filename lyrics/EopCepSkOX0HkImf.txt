You are the mother
Who turns in her sleep
Over and over and over
And the woman with the stiff collar can have even
Your son and your son and your daughter

The past is the past for a reason (Oh)
I didn't give up your ghost for a reason (Oh)
Now I can't sleep for a reason (Oh)
The past is the past for a reason

And I'm going to all the places that
We used, we used to in my head
And I'm lining to not change it up on
How you're doing, how you're feeling
Where you go in the dead of night

The past is the past for a reason (Oh)
I didn't give up your ghost for a reason (Oh)
Now I can't sleep for a reason (Oh)
The past is the past for a reason

I'm lying in the road for a reason
The past is the past for a reason
