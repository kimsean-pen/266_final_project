It feels so good
Oh, that's my shit right there
That's the ticket
Give me the ticket
Give it to me baby
You know it

I'm too emotional
Good luck to my future wives and their future lives without me
You guys will do great
I'm sure that I've prepared you for every guy you'll date
And every guy you'll marry
And every guy you'll hate
It's the lullabies I sang out of tune thats probably what did it
Or my twin size mattress that I had since I was seven
That we have to sleep on whenever she spends the night
And if she falls off again she'll find another guy to like

We're just Romeo & Juliet
But getting drunk and eating percocets
But just to ease the stress
But soft what light, thru yonder window breaks
It is the east, but Juliet just puked off the balcony

How romantic
Nothing like getting drunk and getting manic
On a mother fucking Monday
I-I brush the bangs behind her lovely little ear
As she describes in detail how the end is truly near, wow
And I'm sure that we can do this for forever
Or until we drink the poison, cause she sees some cloudy weather
As Rosaline, lies in bed, seething, wide awake
Because a burning love for Juliet only took a day

And if Romeo & Juliet continued to be married
Thens there's half of a chance
That their kids would get embarrassed
When all the kids at school all talk about their parents
And Romeo Jr. has to say their not together and
Junior will dream of the day when he's a man
And what he'll do to avoid that 50% chance
Of his kids feeling the way he feels
He'll probably just stick with the Netflix and Chill

Dear Shakespeare
Could you write happy ending please
Could you write a happy ending please
We just deserve a happy ending please, please

And every sting from every tear drop
From every ring at every pawn shop
I'm not missing both my Christmas'
Though family would be nice
In my dreams my kids are happy
And I know that they won't mind
One Christmas
Just one Christmas
Just one Christmas
Just one Christmas

But dear mom
Conversations from a couch have never felt the same
Since you looked Dad in the eye
And you told him that "Things are about to change."

My mom was made from Adam's rib
And the marriage went south
And the snake came back and asked my mother out to dinner
And my dad found out
And asked my mom what that's about
And she said "Oh it's nothing."
But dad loves to shout, really loud
Loud enough to knock the lamps and dressers to the ground
In my memory, I can hear
Chopin's Nocturnes playing in the background
A slow train wreck, you'll close your eyes
But forever hear the sound
And boy it's tough
'Cause thats the sound of people falling out of Love
