An open book a will of life
A Gathering of sorts, strings pull the chord
Contusions unfold beneath the dermal layers
Silence uplifts the structure
Nailed and fixed, An ornament to the cause
A slave to his will, Reconstructed to uphold
I will be reborn, Lives ripped and torn
An abomination reborn
Inconceivable power unleashed, Pure evil set forth
To crush the skulls of many and bend the will of the unknowing
Sins of his will, Strings pull the chord
Forced upon you, Absorbs into me sins reborn
Strings of his will, Strings pull the chord
Forced upon you, Absorbs into me sins reborn
Bow down before me, Heed my call
Restitution of all sins
Bow down before me, Heed my call
Be delivered through me
