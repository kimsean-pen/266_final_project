What drives you
No matter what, I'll save you
What breakes you
No matter what, I'll save you
Who loves you
No matter what, I'll save you
I‘ve tried so
I‘ve tried so hard to save you

What drives you
No matter what, I'll save you
What breakes you
No matter what, I'll save you
Who loves you
No matter what, I'll save you
I‘ve tried so
I‘ve tried so hard to save you
