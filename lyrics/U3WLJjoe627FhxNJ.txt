Everyone
I don't know
I am lost
Wandering

Wondering
I don't act
I don't do
I don't know

Put the gun on the floor

Everyone
I don't act
I don't do
I don't know

Everyone
I don't know
I am lost
Wandering

Wondering
I don't act
I don't do
I don't know

Put the gun on the floor

Wondering
I don't act
I don't do
I don't know
