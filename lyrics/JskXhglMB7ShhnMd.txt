Bounce, bounce, bounce

I can't believe that every day and every night (Bounce)
It's gettin' better if you're out of my life (Bounce)
It's like I flicked the switch and now I'm feeling good (Bounce)
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could (Bounce)
When the weekend comes I know I feel alive (Bounce)
You will be the last thing on my mind (Bounce)
No regrets, do you know what that means

Well it's hot, it's loud, it's wild
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back (back, back, back...)

I can love again tonight
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back (back, back, back...)

Bounce, bounce, bounce

Well it's hot, it's loud, it's wild
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
I don't care what anybody thinks about that (that, that, that...)
