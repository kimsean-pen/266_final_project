I'm frozen within the ice and bitter wind
I'm far from blameless
Left alone to the beginning of the end
As seconds bleed down everyone
I can't stop counting
I'm lost in a free fall
But I'm not free at all

The otherside of fear is freedom
The otherside of pain is healing
The madness keeps me from the otherside
The truth, the lie, the shame, the glory
The love, the hate, an endless story
The madness or the otherside

I'm running into the sun
And it's burning me
Feeling touched by heaven and all I see
Are just illusions that are real to me
There's an angel leading me along
An endless highway
I left all I love behind
Killing me inside

The otherside of fear is freedom
The otherside of pain is healing
The madness keeps me from the otherside
The truth, the lie, the shame, the glory
The love, the hate, an endless story
The madness or the otherside

The madness
(The otherside)

The otherside of fear is freedom
The otherside of pain is healing
The madness keeps me from the otherside
The truth, the lie, the shame, the glory
The love, the hate, an endless story
The madness or the otherside
