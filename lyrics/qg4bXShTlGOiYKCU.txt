A word in your ear
From father to son
Hear the word that I say
I fought with you
Fought on your side
Long before you were born

Joyful, the sound
The word goes around
From father to son
To son

And the voice is so clear
Time after time
It keeps on calling you
Calling you on
Don't destroy what you see
Your country to be
Just keep building on the ground
That's been won

Kings will be crowned
The world goes around
From father to son
To son

Won't you hear us sing
(De, de, de, de, de, de, de)
Our family song?
(De, de, de, de, de, de, de) Oh, yeah
(De, de, de, de, de, de, de)
Now we hand it on

But I've heard it all before
Take this letter that I give you
Take it, sonny, hold it high
You won't understand a word that's in it
But you'll write it all again before you die

A word in your ear
From father to son (Funny)
You don't hear a single word that I say
But my letter to you
Will stay by your side thru' the years
'Till the loneliness is gone
Sing if you will
But the air you breathe
I live to give you

Father to son
Father to son, father to son, father to son

Joyful, the sound
The word goes around
From father to son
To son

Kings will be crowned
Earth goes around
Father to son
To son

Joyful, the sound
The word goes around
From father to son
To son

Kings will be crowned
Earth goes around
Father to son
To son

Joyful, the sound
The word goes around
From father to son
To son

Kings will be crowned
Earth goes around
Father to son
To son
