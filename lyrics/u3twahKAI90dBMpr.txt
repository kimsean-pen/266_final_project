Am I singing the whole thing?

It's 4 am, you're calling again
So why can't we be friends? The cycle never ends
Oh oh
And I can taste the alcohol
Knowing that you don't care at all
Telling me that you're still in love
This when I said goodbye
But I hate goodbyes, always seem fake
You pacifies as people comin' in and out your life
Never get the chance to realize
It's way too cold for mid-July
Chillin' by myself and gettin' high
Don't know why I feel so low,
whoa-oh-whoa
You hurt me more than you could know

Baby, you drive me crazy
The only thing I think about lately
Is how I'm slowly fading, fading, fading

Baby you drive me crazy
The only thing I think about lately
Is how I'm slowly fading fading fading

Girl, you got me faded
Yeah, I ain't even playin'
I know that I be drunk
And probably shouldn't say this
But I don't love you no more
It feels so good when I close that door
I neva knew that we'd get this far
I neva knew that'd be this hard
But everything, it has to fall apart

Baby you drive me crazy
The only thing I think about lately
Is how I'm slowly fading fading fading
Baby you drive me crazy
The only thinh I think about lately
Is how I'm slowly fading fading fading

(Guitar solo)

Baby you drive me crazy
The only thing I think about lately
Is how I'm slowly fading fading fading
Baby you drive me crazy
The only thing I think about lately
Is how I'm slowly fading fading fading
