What's the point?
You've been the hero, the starter
The zero, the martyr
And everything in between
The changing face of a legacy

But I've been waiting a long time on the side lines
For the time to be perfect, the wait to be worth it
To watch you find a way to crash and burn

Brace for the hate, to be the subject of debate
Wait for the perfect time for them to watch you wipe the dirt from your face
As you constantly save us from ourselves
I bet you stop before you destroy something else

Don't be alarmed
You've been the one to compare to, but now I'm prepared to
Let you fade away, let you fall into decay

It's time for you to let go
Break down the walls that stand so tall
I'll watch you find a way to crash and burn

Brace for the hate, to be the subject of debate
Wait for the perfect time for them to watch you wipe the dirt from your face
As you constantly save us from ourselves
I bet you stop before you destroy something else

I can't hear you when you're talking through your teeth
Spit it out, and let me go free

'Cause we're never gonna' be like you
We're never gonna' bend the truth
You're never gonna' break us
We're never gonna' be like you
We're never gonna' bend the truth
You're never gonna' break us...

(I can't hear when you talk through your teeth)
(Spit it out and let me go free)

Brace for the hate, to be the subject of debate
Wait for the perfect time for them to watch you wipe the dirt from your face
As you constantly save us from ourselves
I bet you stop before you destroy something else

We're never gonna' be like you
We're never gonna' bend the truth
You're never gonna' break us
We're never gonna' be like you
We're never gonna' bend the truth
We're never gonna' break!
