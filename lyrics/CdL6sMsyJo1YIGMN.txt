Tell you just
Rain on me

Pain from me

See I don't want to hug my pillow late at night no more
I'm tossin' and turnin' and thinkin' 'bout burnin' down these walls
I don't wanna fuel this fire no more, no more, no more
See I made up my mind, 'cause I've wasted my time
Ain't nothin' here to keep me warm, yeah

Over and over I tried (you know)
And over and over you lied (oh yeah)
And over and over I cried (over and over, know why)
Over and over I tried (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm so tired of the rain in my life
And I'm so tired of the strai

And I ain't gonna lie 'cause
Sometimes I can't sleep at night and
This here it just don't seem right and
Sometimes I just wonder why I
Almost let my life go by
Sometimes I can't sleep at night and
This here it just don't seem right and
Sometimes I just wonder why I
Almost let my life go by... ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Rain on me

Pain from me
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe
