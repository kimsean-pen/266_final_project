You've been hurting a long time
The kind of pain I know too well uh
It's been pulling you under
Like some kind of evil spell uh
I'm gonna hold, I'm gonna hold you
Till the ghosts all disappear
I'm not going anywhere
I'm gonna stay right here

If I have to wait for you
I'll hang on the line
If I have to just make due
I'll do it till the end of time
If I have to feel this way
To know that you'll be mine, all mine
That's the choice I'll make
That's the risk I'll take
If I have to wait for you

Your tears are my tears
And I'm crying them too
'Cause I can't, no, I can't
I just can't find a way to get through to you uh
I know you really love me
But there is a part of you still missing
You've given me all that you can
But I want everything, everything, everything

If I have to wait for you
I'll hang on the line
If I have to just make due
I'll do it till the end of time
If I have to feel this way
To know that you'll be mine, all mine
That's the choice I'll make
That's the risk I'll take
If I have to wait for you
Yeah

I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait

If I have to wait for you
I would hold on the line
If I have to just make due
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it,
