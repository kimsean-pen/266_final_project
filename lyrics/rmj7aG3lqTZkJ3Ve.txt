You cannot face the crowd all by yourself
Embrace the power we have
Raise your eyes slowly, place your faith into me
Your body aches to be draped in our delight slowly

Take me in, face the lights
Free yourself and writhe in them

Sound asleep hunting, wide awake moaning
This body aches to be draped in you tonight slowly

Take me in, face the lights
Free yourself and writhe in them
Take me in, face the crowd
Let yourself just writhe in them

You cannot face the crowd all by yourself
Embrace the power we have
The record's ours to break
The more we build, the crowd goes wild, goes wild

Take me in, face the lights
Free yourself and writhe in them
Take me in, face the crowd
Let yourself just writhe in them, writhe in them

You cannot face the crowd all by yourself
Embrace the power we have
The record's ours to break
And the more we build, the crowd goes wild
Goes wild, goes wild, goes wild
