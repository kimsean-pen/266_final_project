Hear the words of the rastaman say
"babylon, you throne gone down, gone down
babylon, you throne gone down."
Said i hear the words of the iyaman say
"babylon, you throne gone down, gone down

babylon, you throne gone down."

and i hear the angel with the seven seals say
"babylon throne gone down, gone down
babylon throne gone down."

i say fly away home to zion (fly away home)
i say fly away home to zion (fly away home)
one bright morning when my work is over
man will fly away home

one bright morning when my work is over
man will fly away home
one bright morning when my work is over
man will fly away home
say one bright morning when my work is over
man will fly away home.
