You Can't save me, you can't save a wretch like me

When she was seventeen
She married a Preacher Man
And she settled down
In a little part of town
Followed him all around
Having little babies
Singing in a little Church
In a little ghost town

She's so happy
(I don't want to keep up I can't keep up)
She's so happy, keeping up
(I don't wanna keep up, keeping up with the Jones')

Finally she told me
Grandpa Dan travelled
Playing on the road
With Nat King Cole
And he womanised
Staying up all night
Cruisin'up around the town
From town to town to town

(Let me go - ahhh ah Hurricane)
(Just let me go - ahhh ah I'm going to care)

Why don't you be a Jones like your Sister and your brother Noel
when are you gonna be a Jones your just like your Dad
And Dan
God bless his soul

I've got the Williams' blood in me
I've got the Williams' blood in me
I've got the Williams' blood in me
(I've got the Williams' blood)
I've got the Williams' blood in me

In me, in me, in me, running though my veins
Williams' blood in me

In a room full of doves
I'm waiting for the Angels
Spreading my wings
So I can fly

(Let me fly)
Hurricane
-You can't save a wretch like me-
(Let me fly ahhhh ahh - hurricane)
(Let me go - ahhh ah Hurricane)

Why don't you be a Jones like your Sister and your brother Noel
when are you gonna be a Jones you're just like your Dad
And Dan
God bless his soul

I've got the Williams' blood in me
I've got the Williams' blood in me
I've got the Williams' blood in me
I've got the Williams' blood in me
I've got the Williams' blood in me
(I don't wanna keep up, I can't keep up)
(I don't wanna keep up, I can't keep up)
(Keeping up with the Jones')

Amazing Grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
