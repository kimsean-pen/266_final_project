How does your bounty taste?
Dining on carrion,
What have we done?
Nothing, nothing, nothing!

Bathe - in the joystream,
Twenty-nine thousand children to tame,
Tomorrow... the whole world!

How does your carrion taste?
Are you not filled with pride?
When will we permit this to end?
Never, never, never!

Bathe - in the joystream,
Twenty-nine thousand children to tame,
Tomorrow... the whole world!
