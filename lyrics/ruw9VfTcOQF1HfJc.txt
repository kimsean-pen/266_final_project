Trying not to lose my head
But I have never been this scared before
Tell you what I'll do instead,
Lay my body down on the floor
To forget what I've done,
Silhouette til the good lord come

All we know is distance
We're close and then we run
Kiss away the difference
I know you hate this one

Trying not to lose your own,
Boxing up everything
You've got all you ever knew of home,
You're scared scared to see
Your mother there in the door,
You wonder where
Did the years go

All we know is distance
We're close and then we run
Kiss away the difference
I know you hate this one

But this is how the story ends
Or have we just begun
To kiss away the difference
I know you hate this one

The violins make no sound
And I begin to feel the ground

All we know is distance
We're close and then we run
Kiss away the difference
I know you hate this one

But this is where the story ends
Or have we just begun
To kiss away the difference
I know you hate this one
