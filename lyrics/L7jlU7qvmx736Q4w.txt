Before day break there was none
And as it broke there was one
The Moon, the sun, it goes on 'n' on

The winter better was warm
The summer children were born
And so the story goes on 'n' on

Come woman if your life beats
Those we buried with the house keys
Smoke and feather where the fields are green
From here to eternity

Come woman on your own time
Far, far, far from the virgin vine
Rising out from the dead leaves
Come back to me

Oh, sing your favorite song
Left to tears
Dreams it goes and then on

A vessel in the bloodline
The 13th zodiac sign
A stitch in time it goes on 'n' on

Someday the grapes will be wine

And someday you will be mine
And so the story goes on 'n' on

Come woman if your life beats
Those we buried with the house keys
Smoke and feather where the fields are green
From here to eternity

Come woman on your own time
Far, far, far from the virgin vine
Rising out from the dead leaves
Come back to me

Oh, sing your favorite song
Left to tears
Dreams it goes and then on

Oh, sing your favorite song
Left to tears
Dreams it goes and then on

The bridge was burning
The ground was said to come back around
From dust to dust it goes on 'n' on

Before daybreak there was none
And as it broke there was one
And so the story goes on 'n' on
