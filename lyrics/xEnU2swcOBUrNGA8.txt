You the birthday bitch
It's time to do some birthday shit

I'm trying to get you to the birthday bed
You can even get the birthday head
That's what you call birthday sex
You don't need no love from ya birthday ex

She came with the birthday clique
Her and the girls looking birthday rich
Take a shot of the birthday liq
I'm trying to get you back home in your birthday fit

It's time to get birthday drunk (What'cha talkin' 'bout?)
I'm talking 'bout birthday slumped
Bend it over this your birthday song
Let the dress come up
Show your birthday thong

G'on ahead, fuck it up in the worst way

And she came with her best friend
So she 'bout to fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up
And she is a good girl
But tonight she's cutting up, cutting up, cutting up, cutting up

Smack her on the booty if it's real for me
Make it roll like it's going down the hill for me
And she about to turn up
If you 'bout the drama
Then it don't concern her

She all on the stage
Got the place about to burn up
She fuck it up
Watch her shake Tina Turner

It's all about you
Girl tonight it's about you
Make the whole club stop whenever she come through
One time for me two

One time for the birthday bitch
Two times for the birthday bitch
Three times for the birthday bitch
Fuck it up if it's your birthday bitch

Fuck it up if it's your birthday bitch
Fuck it up if it's your birthday bitch
Fuck it up if it's your birthday bitch
Fuck it up if it's your birthday bitch

You a bad bitch
And it's your birthday
G'on ahead, fuck it up in the worst way
If you a bad bitch
And it's your birthday
G'on ahead, fuck it up in the worst way, c'mon

One time for the birthday bitch
Two times for the birthday bitch
Three times for the birthday bitch
Fuck it up if it's your birthday bitch
