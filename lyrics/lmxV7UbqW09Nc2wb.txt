I just need someone to please
tell me what I need
I know it might not be
My best idea...
Are you dancing tonight?
Are you asking to be polite?
Do you mind if I tag along?
Oh I won't know just what you're on tonight
I'm 20 minutes into the longest night of my life
I never thought I'd been through much until I saw you that night
But I don't wear my hair back
I don't have enough of that
I don't smoke cigarretes
I don't think I need it
But I need something
I know I need something
Keep your hands in your pockets
They run ...
And talk isn't cheap these days
I want to swear you to change
Or at least get you to stay
But tonight I know at least it might not be my best idea
No I know it might not be my best idea
Are you dancing tonight?
Are you asking to be polite?
Do you mind if I tag along?
Oh I know just what you're on tonight
I'm 20 minutes into the longest night of my life
I never thought I'd been through that much until I saw you that night
No I don't wear my hair back
I don't have enough of that
No I don't smoke cigarretes
I don't think I need it
But I need something
I know I need something
But I don't wear my hair back
I don't have enough of that
No I don't smoke cigarretes
I don't think I need it
But I need something
I know I need something
