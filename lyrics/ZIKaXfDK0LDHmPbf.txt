I wear a greasy ball cap, I like my shirt untucked
I spend Saturdays working on my truck
I don't like to fight but I ain't scared to bleed
Most don't mess with a guy like me

'Cause guys like me drink too many beers on Friday after work
Our best blue jeans have Skoal rings, we wear our boots to church
So rough around the edges it's hard to believe
That girls like you love guys like me

Your daddy worked at the bank, mine worked on cars
You went to college, I pulled graveyard
You must have had your pick of all the trust fund types
But you came back to me and only God knows why

'Cause guys like me drink too many beers on Friday after work
Our best blue jeans have Skoal rings, we wear our boots to church
So rough around the edges it's hard to believe
That girls like you love guys like me, yeah

Now there's a lot of guys like me out there in a lot of little towns
Tellin' all our buddies we won't ever settle down
We say that's just the way we are and the way we'll always be
So God sends girls like you for guys like me
Thank God there's girls like you for guys like me
