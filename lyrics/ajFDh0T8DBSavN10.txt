Almost heaven
West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River
Life is old there
Older than the trees
Younger than the mountains
Growing like a breeze

Country roads
Take me home
To the place
Where I belong
West Virginia
Mountain momma
Take me home
Country roads

All my memories
Gathered 'round her
Miner's lady
Stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty
Painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine
Teardrop in my eye

Country roads
Take me home
To the place
Where I belong
West Virginia
Mountain momma
Take me home
Country roads

I hear her voice
In the morning hour
She calls me
Radio reminds me
Of my home far away
Driving on the road
I get a feeling that
I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads,
Take me home
To the place
Where I belong
West Virginia
Mountain momma
Take me home
Country roads

Take me home
Yeah country roads
Take me home country roads yeah
