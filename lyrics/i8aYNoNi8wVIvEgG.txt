That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head
That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head

It's been a long bumpy ride sittin' back in the saddle
It's time to get down, dirty up our knees in the battle
Come on, round up the boys, gonna make the walls rattle

Oh, our flag is tattered
And our bones are shattered
But it doesn't matter
'Cause we're movin' forward

Round 'em up, round 'em up, let's go
Round 'em up, let's go

Oh, my eyes are seein' red
Double vision from the blood we've shed
The only way I'm leavin' is dead
That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head

They don't know, where we've been
We got that concrete street skin
The only way I'm leavin' is dead
That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head

That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head

We've been shot up, beat up by the fallin' of the arrows
(Arrows, arrows, arrows)
Yeah, I'm full of deep cuts right down to the marrow
But there's no doubt we'll get out from the bottom of the barrel

Oh, our flag is tattered
And my bones are shattered
But it doesn't matter
'Cause we're movin' forward

Round 'em up, round 'em up, let's go
Round 'em up, let's go

Oh, my eyes are seein' red
Double vision from the blood we've shed
The only way I'm leavin' is dead
That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head

They don't know, where we've been
We got that concrete street skin
The only way I'm leavin' is dead
That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head

That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head
That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head

Can you hear me now, can you hear me now
I'm comin' back for more
Do you feel me now, do you feel me now
I'm breakin' down your door

I'm not speakin' under my breath
'Cause the harder you push, the rougher I get
'Cause I'm not shakin', when the earth starts quakin'
Got my own foundation with no hesitation and the

Oh, my eyes are seein' red
Double vision from the blood we've shed
The only way I'm leavin' is dead
That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head

They don't know, where we've been
We got that concrete street skin
The only way I'm leavin' is dead
That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head

The only way I'm leavin' is dead
That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head
The only way I'm leavin' is dead
That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head
