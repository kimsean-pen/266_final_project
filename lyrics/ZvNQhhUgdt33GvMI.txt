Deceit

Come together, together in mass
We the saviors must sever our worst
The hunt begins, they'll suffer the loss
Our greater good no matter the cost

We'll pray for them
But they had to die
Persecution
Where the burials lie

We need to weed out the weak
Gather the poor, the sick and the old (deceit)
We need to weed out the weak
Gather the poor, the sick and the old

We'll pray for them all
But we can not sustain their lives
We hold the cure
But they still had to die

We need to weed out the weak
Gather the poor, the sick and the old (deceit)
We need to weed out the weak
Gather the poor, the sick and the old

We had no choice
For our survival
The hunt begins
The hunt begins

Hammered down, there's death at the door
The night is terror, the scourge does its worst
Hammered down, there's death at the door
The night is terror, the scourge does its worst

Growing revelation
That we are the ones
To carry onward
Our kind restored
Growing revelation
That we are the ones
To carry onward
Our kind restored
Now they all thank the Lord
That the threat is destroyed
Now they all thank the Lord
That the threat is destroyed
Now they all thank the Lord
That the threat is destroyed
Now they all thank the Lord
That the threat is destroyed
