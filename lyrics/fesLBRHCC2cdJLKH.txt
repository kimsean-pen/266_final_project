Well I guess what hurt me most of all
You were playing with my heart
Tell me, why am I emotional
When I knew it from the start?

And tell me, why does my heart burn when I see your face?
You have made your decision, put me in my place
And the lies you've been hiding, taking up your space
Tell me, why does my heart burn this way?
When I see your face
When I see your face

All this time you left me wanting more
Had me swallowing all of my pride
Wonder where this part of you came from
It was hidden in the shallow of your eyes

And tell me, why does my heart burn when I see your face?

You have made your decision, put me in my place
And the lies you've been hiding, taking up your space
Tell me, why does my heart burn this way?
When I see your face
When I see your face

Love oh why have you been hiding?
From the places we've been, from the places we've been
Love oh why have you been hiding?
From the places we've been, from the places we've been
Love oh why have you been hiding?
From the places we've been, from the places we've been
Love oh why have you been hiding?
From the places we've been, from the places we've been

And tell me, why does my heart burn when I see your face?
You have made your decision, put me in my place
And the lies you've been hiding, taking up your space
Tell me, why does my heart burn this way?
When I see your face
