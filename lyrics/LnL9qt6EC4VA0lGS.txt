(Verse)
This space is not my home
This head you drowning is not my home
Made it out cut it out
Take things slow as we may bruise to reach our
Unpredictable pass
Your heart, your heart
Understand mine

Found in for dead nights
Sharpest loud and place is quiet
Know the promises we make
Guard now and never again

(Chorus)
My mouth your lips
Your hands my hips
Hard time right now
Will set free
And relieves us
Of our misery

(Verse)
Secrets lie in our way
Your kiss tastes better outside the light of day
Know you're sure to scratch your back
Break my knuckles feel them crack
I reveal nothing, both played fate
Pretend that you worry our hearts your hearts
That sting

(Chorus)
My mouth your lips
Your hands my hips
Hard time right now
Will set free
And relieves us
Of our misery

(Bridge)
Hard to believe
You could cause me harm
This could cause me harm
Hard to believe
You could cause me harm
This could cause me harm

(Chorus) x2
My mouth your lips
Your hands my hips
Hard time right now
Will set free
And relieves us
Of our misery
