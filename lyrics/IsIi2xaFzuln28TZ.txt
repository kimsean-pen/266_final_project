It Was There (That I Saw You)

It was there that I saw you
And it was there that I came
As evening sighs,
Rises up against the sky-line
Let me come and have my leis
You were fair and fey as a sun that evil day
We were bold and life was great
But as time went on
I wondered what was wrong
I wondered what became of you
Let me hold you in my arms dear
And let me melt in the heat of your gaze
And let the clock strike one,
Time and mind go marching on
Let our sense of selves decay
It was there that I saw you
In the heat of a summer's embrace
But as time went on
I wondered what went wrong
