Only love
Can make it rain
The way the beach is kissed by the sea.
Only love
Can make it rain
Like the sweat of lovers laying in the fields.
Love, Rain on me
Love, Rain on me, Rain on me.
Only love
Can bring the rain
That makes you yearn to the sky.
Only love
Can bring the rain
That falls like tears from on high.
Love, Rain on me.
Love, Rain on me, Rain on me.
On the dry and dusty road
The nights we spend apart alone.
I need to get back home to cool, cool rain.
I can't sleep and I lay and I think
The night is hot and black as ink.
Oh God, I need a drink of cool, cool rain.
Love, Rain on me.
Love, Rain on me, on me.
Love...
