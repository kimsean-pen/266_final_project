Remember years ago when I asked you?
I didn't mean to make you cry.
You were hesitant to answer,
I remember in the night.

Can you hear the rain upon my window?
Sunny days the way it used to be.
All the years are passing on without you.
All the years are passing right by me.

You were standing there on our wedding day.
I still see you when I dream.
Could you harbor me in paradise?
Could you carry me into a better life?
You would die.

Can you hear the rain upon my window?
Sunny days the way it used to be.
All the years are passing on without you.
All the years are passing right by me.
Fly away.
