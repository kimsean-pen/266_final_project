Destruction

War

To fight in defense
Forgotten words
Of friendly hate

War-destruction
War-destruction

I don't know why
A soul deceased
A broken hope
A choking breeze

War-destruction
War-destruction

Can't you take me away from your lies?

Can't you take me away from your lies?

Destruction
Dark paradise
Collecting souls

To analyze
War-destruction
War-destruction
The bitter blood
Of children's cry
Inside the truth
Far from my sky
War-destruction
War-destruction
Can't you take me away from your lies?
Can't you take me away from your lies?
Can't you take me away from your lies?
Can't you take me away from your lies?
Can't you take me away from your lies?
Can't you take me away from your lies?
Can you take me!
Can you take me!
Can you take me!
