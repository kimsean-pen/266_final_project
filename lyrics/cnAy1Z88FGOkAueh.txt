Animals - Alex & sierra

Hiding away
Turned into pray
Like we're animals
Yeah we're loving like we're animals
We know it's to late
(I'm bleeding but it feels right)
Haunted and caged
We're flying through the night
Like we're animals
Yeah we're loving like we're animals
When I hate to break no heart now let it go

Cause every single touch don't mean a thing
And every time you're calling out my name
We know that it's just not to be alone
Cause every single touch don't mean a thing
And every time you're calling out my name
We know that it's just not to be alone
We're loving like we're animals
Like, like we're animals
A, a, a animals
Like we're animals

Under my skin
(Its killing us but it feels right)
Ready to sin
And we take a bite
Like we're animals
Yeah we're loving like we're animals
When I hate to break no hearts just let it go

Cause every single touch don't mean a thing
And every time you're calling out my name
We know that it's just not to be alone
Cause every single touch don't mean a thing
And every time you're calling out my name
We know that it's just not to be alone
We're loving like we're animals
Like, like we're animals
A, a, a, animals
Like we're animals

Save your sorrows
Save them for tomorrow
Cuz in the wild we know

Cause every single touch don't mean a thing
And every time you're calling out my name
We know that it's just not to be alone
Cause every single touch don't mean a thing
And every time you're calling out my name
We know that it's just not to be alone
We're loving like we're animals
Like, like we're animals
A, a, a animals
Like we're animals
