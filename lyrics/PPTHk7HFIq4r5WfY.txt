Good evening
This is the intergalactic operator
Can I help you?

Yes
I'm trying to reach flight commander P.R. Johnson
On Mars. Flight 247

Very well
Hold on, please
You're through

Thank you, operator

Hi, darling
How you doing?
Hey, baby
Were you sleeping?
Oh, I'm sorry
But I've been really missing you

Hi, darling
How's the weather?
Say, baby
Is that cold better, now?
Oh, I'm sorry
Is there someone there with you?

Oh, since you went away, there's nothing going right
I just can't sleep alone, at night
I'm not ashamed to say I badly need a friend
Or it's the end

Now, when I look at the clouds across the moon
Here, in the night, I just hope and pray that, soon
Oh, baby, you'll hurry home to me

Hi, darling
The kids say they love you
Hey, baby
Is everything fine with you?
Please, forgive me
But I'm trying not to cry

Oh, I've had a million different offers on the phone
But I just stayed right here, at home
I don't think that I can take it anymore
This crazy war

Now, when I look at the clouds across the moon
Here, in the night, I just hope and pray that, soon
Oh, darling, you'll hurry home to me

I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation
But we are experiencing violent storm conditions
In the asteroid belt, at this time
We may lose this valuable deep space communication link
Please, be as brief as possible
Thank you

Oh, since you went away, there's nothing going right
I just can't sleep alone, at night
I'm not ashamed to say I badly need a friend
Or it's...
It...

Hello?
Hello, operator?
Yes, I seem to have lost the connection
Could you try again, please?

I'm sorry
But I'm afraid we have lost contact with Mars 247
At this time

Now, when I look at the clouds across the moon
(Ok. Well, thank you very much)
Here, in the night, I just hope and pray that, soon
(I'm so... I'll try again, next year)
Oh, baby, you'll hurry home to me
(Next year)
(Next year)
