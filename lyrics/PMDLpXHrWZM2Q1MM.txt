Feeling like we're, ready to kick tonight
No hesitating, my bodies aching
Looking for some action, satisfaction all right
Charging, vein faced, as active as one-hundred solid proof
Mega town, Leviathan, we're ready to hit the roof

You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Uhhh, Delivering the goods
Uhhh, Delivering the goods

Shake down, rock 'em boys, crack that whip strap mean
Pulse rave, air waves, battle lies in every place we've been
Stealing your hearts all across the land
Hot blood doing good, we're going to load you with our brand

You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Uhhh, Delivering the goods
Yeah, Delivering the goods

Have your way
Stealing your hearts

Well we don't pull no punches, we aim where the crunch is
The bound to do most damage to your brain
If you're looking for it mellow
you're nothing more than yellow
Gonna do it again and again
We'll beat you to submission
So you might as well surrender
You do gotta learn your lesson
'Cause there ain't nobody here to defend your heart

Faster, higher
'Til it seems that we're gonna break
Ohh shootin' further, giving more than you're ever gonna take
Weaving with your heads
Crushed out on the floor
Begging for mercy
Be careful or we'll do it some more
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Uhhh, Delivering the goods
Uhhh, Delivering the goods
