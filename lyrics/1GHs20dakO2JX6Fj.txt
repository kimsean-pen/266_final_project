I took a backseat, a backhander
I took her back to her room
I better get back to the basics for you
Oh yeah!
You have a conscience, compassion
You gotta way with the word
You gotta heart full of complacency too
Yes I like that darling
I don't have a purpose or mission
I'm empty by definition
I've got a lack girl that you'd love to be
Hoo!
You wanna diva, a deduction
You wanna do what they do
Wanna do a damage that you can undo
Apart from everyone
Away from your love
A part of me belongs
Apart from all the hurt above
I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification
I got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
I got a perfect way to make the girls go crazy
I took a day job, amendment
I took a liking to you
I took a page out of my rulebook for you
You want a message, a confession
You want to martyr me too
You want a margin of error for two
Yes I like that
Maybe tomorrow the next letter
Or when the weather gets better?
I gotta wait here for your moon to turn blue
I made an offer, exception
I made a sense out of you
You took a good look at your book and I knew
In times of tenderness
In terms baby so true
Until such time as I
Can understand all the things you do
I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification
I got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
I got a perfect way to make the girls go crazy

I want to forgive you
For the things that you do
But I forget how to remember with you
Maybe tomorrow, the next letter
Or when the weather gets better?
I've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue
Apart from everyone
Away from your love
A part of me belongs
Apart from all the hurt above
I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification
This is a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
This is a perfect way to make the girls go crazy
A perfect way
A perfect way
I got a perfect way, a perfect way
I got a perfect way, a new proposition
I got a perfect way, justification
I got a perfect way, maybe
