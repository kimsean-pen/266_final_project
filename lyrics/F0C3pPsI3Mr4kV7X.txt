We are young, so we untie
We are young, we get tired
Walking on rooftops, feel so heavy
I could never leave you if you let me try
Go on and let me try
Steady now, but falling slack
Stepping out, but falling back
Under-passing all your dreaming
I'll admit feeling a little uneasy about
You want to cut me out
Just one more take
I'm still feeling my way
Still feeling my way

We are caught, so we unwind
We are caught, 'til we untie
Talk about leaving here together
One more try, it'll all get better
I doubt you want to work it out
Just one more take
I'm still feeling my way
Still feeling my way

Just one more take
I'm still feeling my way
I'm still feeling my way
I'm still feeling my way
I'm still feeling my way
