When you said, "let's start what you wanted"
When I stayed, I started what you wanted
Did you really thought how it would end?
How broken, how I mend?
Or how many people you lose as friends?
When you're fading in and out of being conscious
Do you ever try to make amends?
Think how the play would end?
Or how you would come back from the bends?

I know that dreams come true
But I never thought that I would have to leave you

You, you
(That I would have to leave you)
You, you
(That I would have to leave you)

I can't keep up with you making up nonsense
So I'm letting go and pushing you away
There's a reason that you stay
I can't afford to wait for another forty days
Wasting all that time was weighing on my conscious
Feeling numb again, a feeling that I cannot shake
Think I'm finally awake
I'd rather do it right than do it fake

I know that dreams come true
But I never thought that I would have to leave you

You, you
(That I would have to leave you)
You, you
(That I would have to leave you)

And I can never go back
To the way things were, to the way that things were, to the way that things were
And I can never go back
To the way things were, to the way that things were, to the way that things were

You, you
(That I would have to leave you)
You, you
(That I would have to leave you)

You, you
(That I would have to leave you)
You, you
(That I would have to leave you)

And I can never go back
To the way things were, to the way that things were, to the way that things were
And I can never go back
To the way things were, to the way that things were, to the way that things were
