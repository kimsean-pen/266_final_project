We're the orphans from the holy land, the tears of Jerusalem
And in darkness we have prayed and swore to rise up once again

We are the sons of the blazing sun
Sharing our faith through the barrel of a gun
Walk on holy water yet we burn
Brothers of the orient stand as one

An ancient promise in an orphaned land
A clenched fist becomes an open hand
Armed forces spill their blood on holy sands
Again and again we fail to see that all is one

Words like venom through our veins they run
Weaving a web of deception hope is gone
Shall we re-live the pain of wars before?
Or shall we be the light, the new folklore?

Evil falls on each of us, there's nothing new
Who cares if you're a Muslim or a Jew
The awakened ones are nothing but a few
And the one to make the difference now is you

From the Middle Eastern lands we ride, all children of Abraham
Our only sword, the light within, that burns as bright as sun
Wer're the orphans from the Holy Land, the keepers of Or-Shalem
So we bow to you our warriors for being simple men
