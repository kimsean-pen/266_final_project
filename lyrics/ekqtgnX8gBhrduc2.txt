Cassius is over!
Cassius away!
Cassius these daydreams, these daydreams decay

Cassius an accident!
Cassius an accident!
Accident!
Accident!
Accident!

Cassius it's over!
Cassius away!
Cassius these daydreams, these daydreams decay

The lighthouse is an accident!
The lighthouse is an accident!
Accident!
Accident!
Accident!

Wish you've gone-a, wish you've gone away, what you've gone-a
What you've got has always gone away
Cassius! Cassius! at best, it's all that we could do
It's All that we could do

The wind is in, the wind is in my heart, the wind is in-
Now what you've got has always gone away
Cassius! Cassius! at best, it's all that we could do
It's all that we could do

Cassius, it's over! You're second best!
Cassius, it's over! You're second best!
It's over! You're second best!
Second best!
Second best!
Second best!

Cassius it's over!
Cassius away!
Cassius these daydreams, these daydreams decay

The Lighthouse is an accident!
The lighthouse is an accident!
Accident!
Accident!

Wish you've gone-a, wish you've gone away, what you've gone-a
What you've got has always gone away
Cassius! Cassius! at best, it's all that we could do
It's All that we could do

The wind is in, the wind is in my heart, the wind is in-
Now what you've got has always gone away
Cassius! Cassius! at best, it's all that we could do
It's all that we could do

Cassius, it's over! You're second best!
Cassius, it's over! You're second best!
It's over! You're second best!
Second best!

Wish you've gone-a, wish you've gone away, what you've gone-a
What you've got has always gone away
