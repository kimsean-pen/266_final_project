Where are you tonight?
Wild flower in starlit heaven
Still enchanted in flight
Obsessions lament to freedom
A timeless word, the meanings changed
But I'm still burning in your flames
Incessant, lustral masquerade
Unengaged, dim lit love didn't taste the same
And I still wonder if you ever wonder the same

And I still wonder...
