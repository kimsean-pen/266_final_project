We'll find a way regardless
To make some sense out of this mess
Well it's a test, but I believe
A kiss is all we need

All the above for being in love
Shouldn't that alone be enough?
Oh it's tough when love's a weed
It grows inside of me

Nothing's ever gonna stand in my
Nothing's ever gonna stand in my
Nothing's ever gonna stand in my way again

Waste the days, waste the nights
Try to downplay being uptight
Oh you're right, but I believe
A kiss is all we need

Nothing's ever gonna stand in my
Nothing's ever gonna stand in my
Nothing's ever gonna stand in my way again

A watch that ticks is wrapped around my wrist
Oh no
I'm a bomb regardless, oh
I'm a bomb regardless, oh
I'm a bomb regardless, oh
I'm a bomb regardless, oh

We'll find a way
We'll find a way
We'll find a way

Nothing's ever gonna stand in my
Nothing's ever gonna stand in my
Nothing's ever gonna stand in my way again
Nothing's ever gonna stand in my
Nothing's ever gonna stand in my
Nothing's ever gonna stand in my way again
