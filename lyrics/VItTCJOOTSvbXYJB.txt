It's gonna be me baby
It's gonna be you baby
Time I have been patient for so long
How can I pretend to be so strong?
Looking at you baby
Feeling it too baby
If I'm asking you to hold me tight

then it's gonna be all night
It's gonna be Love
It's gonna be great
It's gonna be more than I can take
It's gonna be free
It's gonna be real
It's gonna change everything I feel
It's gonna be sad

It's gonna be true
It's gonna be me baby
It's gonna be you baby
It's gonna be... Its gonna be Love
Time am i restless or a fool
How can you pretend to be so cruel?
Maybe it's me baby

Maybe it's you baby
Maybe it's everything we've been dreaming of
We waited long enough
Its gonna be Love
It's gonna be great
It's gonna be more than I can take
It's gonna be free
It's gonna be real

It's gonna change everything I feel
It's gonna be sad
It's gonna be true
It's gonna be all I want to do
It's gonna be me baby
It's gonna be you baby
The sooner you let two hearts beat together
The sooner you know this love is forever
It's gonna be love

Love needs time now or never
Its gonna be love
You really got to believe
it's gonna be strong enough
Its gonna be Love
It's gonna be great
It's gonna be more than I can take
It's gonna be free
It's gonna be real
It's gonna change everything I feel

It's gonna be sad
It's gonna be true
It's gonna be all i want to do
It's gonna be hard
It's gonna be tough
It's gonna be more than just enough
It's gonna be LOVE
It's gonna be Love
It's gonna be sad
It's gonna be true
It's gonna be me baby
It's gonna be you baby
It's gonna be me baby
It's gonna be you
It's gonna be real
It's gonna be love
