Now some of us are weak
And some endure
And some people live their life
In violence that's pure and clean

But I saw a man cry once
Down on his knees
In the corner of a darkened set
And his pain meant nothing to me

But I was younger then
And young men never die
When I walked out in the sun
I was strong
Clear-minded and blind

I don't say prayer for anyone
It doesn't do any good
Please don't ask me questions
They'd just be misunderstood

And if you could step inside me
And feel what hatred brings
And if you saw with my eyes
You'd see what self-deception means

I was younger once
And I created a lie
And though my body was strong
I was self-deluded
Confident and blind

Now show some pity
For weak of will
Because when we're drinking
We can never be fixed

Show some understanding
For the lonely fool
Because when I'm drinking
I'm out of control

I was never young
Nothing has transpired
But when I look in the mirror
I feel dead
I feel cold
I am blind

I am blind
I am blind
I am blind
