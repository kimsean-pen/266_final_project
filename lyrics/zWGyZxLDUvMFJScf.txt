iieee heh ah, iieee eh ah, iieee eeh ahh
iieee-ee hee-ahh
Ya da he-yah
Ya da-da lah, ya da hee-ah

Yah iieee yah
With your E's
And your ease
And I do one more (iieee)

Need a lip gloss boost
In your America (iieee)
Is it yours
Is it God's
Sweet saliva
With your E's

And your ease
And I do one more
I know we're dying

And there's no sign of a parachute
We scream in cathedrals
Why can't it be beautiful?
Why does there got to be a sa- (come on) sacrifice?

Got to be a sa- sacrifice?
Iieee-eee hee, I said
Just say yes, you little arsonist
You're so sure you can save every hair on my chest

Just say yes you little arsonist, come on
With your E's and your ease
And I do one more
With your E's
And your ease
And I do one more
Ya la dyah
Ya da-da yah, yah iieee-ah
Ya dah iieee-ah
I know we're dying
And there's no sign of a parachute
In this chapel, little chapel of love
Can't we get a little grace and some elegance?
No, we scream in cathedrals
Why can't it be beautiful?
Why does there got to be a sa- (come on) sacrifice?
Got to be a sa- sacrifice, boys
Got to be a sa- sacrifice?
