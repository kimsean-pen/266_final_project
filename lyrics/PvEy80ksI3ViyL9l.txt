I thought that it was different
Thought that everything was as it seemed
And life was like a movie
But I was living in a dream

Oh, oh, oh
Rain's falling now
Oh, oh, oh
And it drowns me out

All I got is myself tonight
I tried listening to you
But all the things you put me through
You put me through

All the things you put me through
Were hurting me, not you

Were hurting me, not you
All the things you put me through
Were hurting me, not you

You're hurting me, not you
You, oh oh

But all the things you put me through
Were hurting me, not you

Were hurting me, not you
All the things you put me through
Were hurting me, not you

Were hurting me, not you
All the things you put me through
Were hurting me, not you

Were hurting me, not you
You, oh oh
And all the things you put me through
You put me through

You're hurting me, not you
You, oh oh
And all the things you put me through
Were hurting me, not you
