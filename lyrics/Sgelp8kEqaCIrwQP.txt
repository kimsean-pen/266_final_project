Baby blue jeans
Had your hand on my knee
I'd get shivers down my spine each time you touch me
Salt in your kiss
From the 2 A.M swim
I wish I could put my arm around your memory

You can't control that you can't help it when you fall in love
I gave you everything and now I gotta give you up
And I know it's over
But if it's any closure

Even if I knew it would end
Even if I knew we wouldn't walk away friends
I'd still do it again
(I'd still do it again)
I'd still do it again
(I'd still do it again)

All of those nights
Still tattooed on my mind
No matter where I go you'll be a part of me forever

You can't control that you can't help it when you fall in love
I gave you everything and now I gotta give you up
And I know it's over
But if it's any closure

Even if I knew it would end
Even if I knew we wouldn't walk away friends
I'd still do it again
(I'd still do it again)
I'd still do it again
(I'd still do it again)

Even if I knew it would end
Even if I knew we wouldn't walk away friends
I'd still do it again
(I'd still do it again)
I'd still do it again
I'd still do it again

Sometimes I wanna call
'Cause even though it wasn't right
I still hope you're alright

Sometimes I wanna call
'Cause even though it wasn't right
I still hope you're alright

'Cause even if I knew it would end
Even if I knew we wouldn't walk away friends
I'd still do it again
(I'd still do it again)
I'd still do it again
(I'd still do it again)

'Cause even if I knew it would end
Even if I knew we wouldn't walk away friends
I'd still do it again
(I'd still do it again)
I'd still do it again
And again
And again
Even if I knew it would end
Even if I knew it would end
Even if I knew it would end
Even if I knew it would end
Even if I knew it would end
Even if I knew it would end
