I am a loner
And I payed my dues
And I don't depend on nothing
Or none
I am a loner
All confused
Waiting for that rainy day
While I spend my time
Walking in the sunshine

Swinging in my palm tree
Cause I love coconuts
I'm drinking Coconut Kiss
And you don't get to know me
You don't get to know me

Hey you, waiting for that blow
For that big fat fall
When mama's gonna get a wake up call?
Until then, I treat em coca
I treat em fries
Go put on your nice face, now
Go put on a nice face

Swinging in my palm tree
Cause I love coconuts
I'm drinking Coconut Kiss
And you don 't get to know me
You don 't get to know me

I like to watch the world
The world is looking good today
It's almost like I 'm sleeping
I pull my head back to the sun

Clean my house, from big fat flies
Dreaming of the big city
Clear my head, clean my bed
Dreaming of the big city
The big City
