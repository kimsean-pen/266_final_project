You wake up, it's raining and it's Monday
Looks like one of those rough days
Time's up, you're late again
So get out the door (out the door)

Sometimes you feel like running
Find a whole new life, and jump in
Let go, get up and hit the dance floor

But when the lights go down
It's the ending of the show (ending of the show)
And you're feeling like you got nowhere to go
Don't you know?

You can change your hair, and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say "goodbye," and you can say "hello"
But you'll always find your way back home

You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly, and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows
You'll always find your way back home

Ha! Your best friends, your little hometown
Are waiting up wherever you go now (mmm)
You know that you can always turn around (turn around)

'Cause, this world is big and it's crazy (it's crazy)
And this girl is thinking that, maybe
This life is what some people dream about (dream about)

'Cause, when I'm feeling down, and I am all alone, whoa, oh
I've always got a place where I can go
'Cause, I know

You can change your hair, and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say "goodbye," and you can say "hello"
But you'll always find your way back home

You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly, and you can chase your dreams (your dreams)
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows (everybody knows)
You'll always find your way back home

Where they know exactly who you are (back home)
Where the real you is the superstar (back home)
You know it's never too far away

You can change your hair, and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say "goodbye," and you can say "hello"
But you'll always find your way back-

You can change your hair, and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes (that's just the way it goes)
You can say "goodbye," and you can say "hello" (say "hello")
But you'll always find your way back home

You can change your style, yeah, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly, and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows (everybody knows)
You'll always find your way back home

You'll always find your way back home
You'll always find your way back home
You'll always find your way back home
You'll always find your way back home
You'll always, you'll always find your way
You'll always find your way back home
