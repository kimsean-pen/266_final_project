If I should die before I wake
It's cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh

I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete

Wish there was a way that I could make you understand
But how do you expect me
To live alone with just me

'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gonna be without me

If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There'a no air, no air

I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground, to flow to you
There's no gravity to hold me down, for real

So how do you expect me
To live alone with just me
Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gonna be without me
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air
