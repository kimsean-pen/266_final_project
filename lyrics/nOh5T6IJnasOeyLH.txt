When the world comes crashing down
Where will, where will you be?

Seems like you are never there for me
Through the hardest of times
Why can't you set me free?
Why can't you set me free?
Truth be told
I never believed in much
This time alone
Just trying to avoid your clutch

There's a fear in all of us
Do we question, believe there is more?
We're following a false sense of hope
Are we too blind to see
That there's more than this?

I've been lost in all the silence
Been trapped inside my head
Not knowing if this is the end
If this is the end

Faith is hard to keep when
All these emotions cut so deep
Is there someone out there
Besides the ones who don't fucking care?
Fucking care
See the empty sky and just say goodbye

There's a fear in all of us
Do we question, believe there is more?
We're following a false sense of hope
Are we too blind to see
That there's more than this?

How can you not see it's killing me?
So far from where I need it to be
Where I need it to be
Stop giving me false hope, false hope
All of this is just a fucking joke, it's over now
So say that we both knew
It's too late, but it's too late

(It's over now) Where were you when I needed you?
(It's over now) Where were you when I reached the end?
