it's raining on me, i don't want it to stop
i don't want to breathe anymore
i want soggy ground, i want to feel my feet in the sand
i want water to rise and to cover all the land
i want to swim til my arms give out and i come to an end
i hope it happens soon i can't deal with feeling this bad
i want to be cold
and i want it to snow so bad
i hope your flames don't grow
i want to be buried in snow
i hope your flames don't grow
i just want to be cold
i don't want you to know
