Noah cursed Canaan to live as a servant
Teshub was angered and the storm
Was sweeping through the land

Land of Gods of wind and sea
Of purple dawns (and) fertility

I want to see the Great Kings rule again
I want to grow the grapes
For the canaanites
I want to sail upon the seven seas

I want to see the old gods rule again
I want to make the wine for the canaanites
I want to sail upon the seven seas
I want to see the Great Kings rule again

(They Were) Founders of towns
And the founders of states
Punic Phoenicians
Praise of El Elyon, mighty God of the skies
He's the Father of Man

O El, Father of Man
O Father of Man
O Father of time
El Elyon
(El Elyon
Abu, Abu Adami
Abu, Abu Shanima)

El, Anath and Baal
O Astarte you're naked with a Lilly
(And you're) Holding a serpent

O Baal-Shamem, Lord of Heaven
Giver of rain, (the) one who prevails
Son of Dagon
You're the thunder with a spearhead

El, Anath and Baal
O Astarte you're naked with a Lilly
(And you're) Holding a serpent

You raise you spear (and) silence the Men
You're the thunder with a spearhead

Qudshu Anath, Shalim, El, Baal Aliyan
Holy Virgin, bringer of peace, Shalim
May all the gods
Break the curse of Canaan
Qudshu Anath, Shalim, El, Ball Aliyan

Land of Canaan, (the) Son of Ham
Red hot and purple, close to Land of Khem

From the sea to Jordan
They will travel in the name of gods
(Visit the) temples of Ugarit
Honour gods under the cedar trees
(They) showed a path through
The seas before unknown in the history
Guided by (the) Polar Star
Into a phoenician galaxy

Grapes of the wine the nectar of time.

Sail on the sea, come to me
Through the night
Pass through the gate
And steer your course
Until you reach the gods

Enter the sky
Take a step
Make them see
When you arrive
Go all the way
Until you reach
The gods
(We enter the land
The Land of Canaan
We break the old curse
Of the son of Ham
And steer to the stars
The sphere of Dagon)

Baal-Shamem, El Elyon
The pantheon of the canaanites
