Dave: [I don't think it's Sacred Priests, doesn't sound right]
Bud: [ It does fit the song's meaning, if not the precise sound
though. Pious priests, with their "narrow ways," wouldn't
care at all to argue with you or I because they know they
are right. And of course, the angels they pretend to
know so much about, in reality, favour "us". But, these
priests cannot see the inner man.
But the song begins with the sound, "ey" or "hey". Comical.
What do you think?
Sacred priests don't cry...(?)
[____-tries] don't cry
they've no reason to argue
at all

Change: Hey Patrice don't cry,
they've no reason to harm you at all
they don't realize
that the angels surround you in light
they don't understand
their narrow ways defeat them where they stand
they don't realize
you hide your sadness beneath a painted smile.
Ignorance,
that blind old fool, steers a wayward path
and set the course upon which we sing into a night of uncertainty
Following the stars
that make their way across the sky
valuing the love
that land brings to our eyes
We sail...
