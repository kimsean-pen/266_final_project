On a money of my plateau
You could leave me and let me go
But i wouldn't want to fight
And i wouldn't let you go

Cuz the money you know won't show
And the size that you'll know won't go
So why you're complaining, ta?

You need a thing i might have
And I need it oh so bad
If you fish in a man-made lake
Don't mind the fishing to cruise the end off

There's the money that you leave me for
And the size, they run out the door
So why you're complaining Ta?
