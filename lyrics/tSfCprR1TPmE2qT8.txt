They say that there's no hope
Don't think, do what you're told
No!

We've lost our way
Abandoned foundations on which we were made
We're all dying of the same disease
I looked for the answer and the problem was me

All along we've been searching for a place to call our home
You and I will never learn if we try to do this on our own

Underneath it all we are all the same (All the same)
Never knowing where to go, lost in our way
Can we ever escape?
Can we decide our fate?
Let go!

I'm more than familiar with feeling like I've failed to meet everyone's expectations
When every definition of success becomes different, it's hard to really feel like you're making a difference

They say that there's no hope
Don't think, do what you're told
Dare to be different, to break the mold
Live your life with intention
Go forth and be bold

All along we've been searching for a place to call our home
You and I will never learn if we try to do this on our own

Why do we try to overcomplicate the things that used to be so simple?
So step back, you'll be able to see that your purpose in life is not just to be

Underneath it all we are all the same (All the same)
Never knowing where to go, lost in our way
Can we ever escape?
Can we decide our fate?

Underneath it all we are all the same (All the same)
Never knowing where to go, lost in our way
Can we ever escape?
Can we decide our fate?

I've come to grips with the fact that I'll never be able to change my own past
But I've found strength in divine perspective
It took me twenty one years to realize: Hope, Love, and Faith are how we survive

Grace sustains me
Pain has ending
There's still hope.
