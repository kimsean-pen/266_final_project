You drive me drive me crazy
All around is so hazy
This dance became a little bit lazy
You always drive me drive me crazy

I'm in love
Bring me to life, babe
Bring me to life, babe
I'm in love
Feeling alright, babe
Feeling alright, babe

You drive me drive me crazy
Can't think my dots are hazy
This feeling is amazing
You always drive me drive me crazy

I'm in love
Bring me to life, babe
Bring me to life, babe
I'm in love
Feeling alright, babe
Feeling alright, babe
I'm in love
Bring me to life, babe
Bring me to life, babe
I'm in love
Feeling alright, babe
Feeling alright, babe

(Feeling alright, babe)

I'm in love
Bring me to life, babe
Bring me to life, babe
I'm in love
Feeling alright, babe
Feeling alright, babe
I'm in love
