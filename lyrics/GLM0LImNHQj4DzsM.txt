Can't get out
I know it's closer and for now
There's something I can't live without
Can't save me now
And drag me in
And take me to my reckoning
I'll do the time
I'll pay the price
I'll pay the price

All I need is you
All I need is you
All I need is you
Take me to delirium
All I need is you
All I need is you
All I need is you
Take me to delirium

In my dreams
Nothing is really what it seems
I live my life inside my cage
I can't scape
On my knees
Cave in and let my body bleed
There's something in the air I breath
Are you like me?

All I need is you
All I need is you
All I need is you
Take me to delirium

Somewhere someone'll hear me calling
From delirium
Someday someone'll catch me falling
Are you that someone?

All I need is you
All I need is you
All I need is you
Take me to delirium
All I need is you
All I need is you
All I need is you
Take me to delirium
