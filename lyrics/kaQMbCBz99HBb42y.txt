I'm only human
Sometimes I make mistakes
If you forgive me
I'm gonna do what it takes
But now I know better
To hurt you was wrong
Girl, it's with you I belong

Somebody needs you
Like never before
Somebody wants your love
Baby open the door
Don't you leave me alone
Don't you turn out the light
Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you tonight

I've been thinking
We should be talking it through
You must believe me
I'll make it all up to you
'Cause now I know better
To hurt you was wrong
Girl it's with you I belong

Somebody needs you
Like never before
Somebody wants your love
Baby open the door
Don't you leave me alone
Don't you turn out the light
Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you tonight

Somebody needs you tonight
In the dark
When there's no one else around
I still pray, that our love
Can be found

Somebody needs you
Like never before
Somebody wants you
Baby open the door
Don't you leave me alone
Don't you turn out the light
Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you

Somebody needs you
Like never before
Somebody wants your love
Baby open the door
Don't you leave me alone
Don't you turn out the light
Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you tonight
