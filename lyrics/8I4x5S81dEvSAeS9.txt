Every sleepless night
I freeze to the bone
Every sunless day begs for the thaw
But all warmth has gone from this
place My eyes open and the world is new
The weight of the sun
The cost of love
The fear of peace carved into my bones Such sweet hell
If I give in
I let him win
Such sweet hell
For within me waits a patient man
Look upon me
All the world
Behold thy pain and weight of fear
I will carry you
I won't give in
I will carry you to my end
