I've been dragging out my love over 13 months right now
It's been a year and I believe in who I've found
I've been trying out this thing they call happiness for a while
But I never truly cleared my cluttered mind

Because I knew that you'd get sick of all the stupid things I did
And how I never think far enough ahead
Cause my drinking takes its toll on everybody here I meet, especially you
It's like you're the generate disease

Because it eats away at everything
But mostly love
The strength we build between us
And all the time it takes to build the trust right back up
Isn't worth a single drop of glass of anything
And I don't want anything

I've got a liver full of toxins and barely full of fire
And a tendency to lose myself for a while
Cause all the countless nights I spent cowering in bed
Cause I can't fight the voice that rings inside my head

Because it eats away at everything
But mostly love
The strength we build between us
And all the time it takes to build the trust right back up
Isn't worth a single drop of glass of anything
And I don't want anything, but you

Because it eats away at everything
But mostly love
The strength we build between us
And all the time it takes to build the trust right back up
Isn't worth a single drop of glass of anything
I don't want anything

Because it eats away at everything
But mostly love
The strength we build between us
And all the time it takes to build the trust right back up
Isn't worth a single drop of glass of anything
And I don't want anything, but you
