I wait around for the "Still small center"
From saint to sinner
Well which one is it?
Just who do you think you are?
(Just who do you think you are?)

Well who did you call to get this?
Well is it who I think it is?
I swear to god I'm gonna kill him.

You always knew it was on purpose
Yeah what's the point if it don't serve it's purpose
"Splintered but focused" you're as good as gold
You're built from distractions so brilliantly dull
I had a better friend in my worst of plans
Than I ever had in either one of you.

Well I never made a scene
(Well they came to me)
Well I never made a scene
Well they came to me
I didn't have to I didn't have to
Well I never made a scene
I didn't have to I didn't have to
Well I never made a scene

I always hoped to avoid the issues
Got me alone so I couldn't address you
Home is where you make it, Love,
Don't get yourself confused
Besides what's it to you?
I traded my conscience for your
For your confidence
Attacked my lungs with lies to pass the time
Made states move like regular days

I didn't have to I didn't have to
Well I never made a scene
I didn't have I didn't have to
Well I never made a scene
I didn't have to I didn't have to
Well I never made a scene
I didn't have to I didn't have to
Well I never made a scene

I never made a scene
Well they came to me
I never made a scene
Well they came to me

I didn't have to I didn't have to
Well I never made a scene
I didn't have to I didn't have to
Well I never made a scene
I didn't have to I didn't have to
Well I never made a scene
I didn't have to I didn't have to
Well I never made a scene
