There's no white horse coming
With his guns drawn and his
With his leaves on
There's no point now in running
With our tails tucked between us

All I've ever wanted
Was a simple life full of complications
All I've ever wanted
Was an easy love full of tough relations

When the day is done
And the night is young
Find a body to belove and
Slip of the tongue
When the day is done
And the night is young
Find a body to belove and
Slip of the tongue

There's no chance of revision
It's a done deal well it's a
It's such a fine steal mama

And I don't know what they been cooking
There's a big plan and it's
And it's coming

All I've ever wanted
Was a simple life full of complications
All I've ever wanted
Was an easy love full of tough relations

When the day is done
And the night is young
Find a body to belove and
Slip of the tongue
When the day is done
And the night is young
Find a body to belove and
Slip of the tongue

When the day is done
And the night is young
Find a body to belove and
Slip of the tongue
When the day is done
And the night is young
Find a body to belove and
Slip of the tongue

When the day is done
And the night is young
Find a body to belove and
Slip of the tongue
When the day is done
And the night is young
Find a body to belove and
Slip of the tongue
