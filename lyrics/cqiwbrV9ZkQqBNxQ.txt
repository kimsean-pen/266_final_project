Space between you and I can grow
But we'll still be tied by these wires

I find you there when my lovers gone
And I know we can harbour our lust

And I'm moving like I'm cruising so low
Saying what I want as I go
Breaking your heart just at my fingertips

Got a feeling she's my only one
Leaving proof of the damages done
Fooling myself with you at my fingertips

Kept from eyes behind walls
these lies hold my time my horror and worth

Trapped within my own body
I hopelessly try to cover my ways

And I'm moving like I'm cruising so low
Saying what I want as I go
Breaking your heart just at my fingertips

Got a feeling she's my only one
Leaving proof of the damages done
Fooling myself with you at my fingertips

I want you but I have another
Needing you to be my lover
I want you but I have another

I want you but I have another
Needing you to be my lover
I want you but I have another

I find you there
When my lovers gone
And I know we can harbour our lust
