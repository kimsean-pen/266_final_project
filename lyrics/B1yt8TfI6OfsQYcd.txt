"Shame is soft", they say
Lose when I play your game
Come if you call my name
Lose when I play your game

You got an attitude
You, you've got a way

All fortune on the floor
All fortune on the floor
All fortune on the floor
All fortune on the floor

"Shame is soft", they say
Lose when I play your game

All fortune on the floor
All fortune on the floor
All fortune on the floor
All fortune on the floor
