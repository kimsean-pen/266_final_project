I'd sing more about moral of this land
But all God's children ain't free
I'd open up every door I can
'Cause all God's children ain't free

I met a beaten broken man
He shovels dirt but got no land
And he held out his hand to me
All God's children ain't free

I'd sing along too, a silly song
But all God's children ain't free
I'm gonna sing the blues for the men they done wrong
'Cause all God's children ain't free

Mister, how about the man you condemn to die?
But taking everything that he's livin' by

And reject him from society
All God's children ain't free
No, reject him from society
All God's children ain't free

I'd be happy walking any street
But all God's children ain't free
I'd have a smile for all I meet
But all God's children ain't free

I'd whistle down the road but I wouldn't feel right
I'd hear somebody cryin' out at night

From a sharecropper shack or penitentiary
All God's children ain't free
From a sharecropper shack or penitentiary
All God's children ain't free
