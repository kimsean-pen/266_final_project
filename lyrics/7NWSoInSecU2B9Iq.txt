You're a bad influence
And I'm in trouble
You got me powered up
On the double

Ooh-hoo-hoo
If you wanna do
What I wanna do
Then we're going down down down

Ooh-hoo-hoo
If You come through
For what I wanna do
Then we're going down down down

And if you feel like I feel
Put your hearts up, put your hearts up
And we got love designed to kill
Put your hearts up, put your hearts up

You can't control the kids
You can't control the kids
You can't control the kids
Put your hearts up

You can't control the kids
You can't control the kids
You can't control the kids
Put your hearts up

Bass drum overload
No division
Lift me off the ground
Be my ignition

Ooh-hoo-hoo
If you wanna do
What I wanna do
Then we're going down-down-down

Ooh-hoo-hoo
If you come through
For what I wanna do
Then we're going down-down-down

And if you feel like I feel
Put your hearts up, put your hearts up
And we got love designed to kill
Put your hearts up, put your hearts up

You can't control the kids
You can't control the kids
You can't control the kids
Put your hearts up

You can't control the kids
You can't control the kids
You can't control the kids
Put your hearts up

You can't control the kids
You can't control the kids
You can't control the kids
You can't control the kids
You can't control the kids
You can't control the ki
