I'm not gonna do while lookin' at you
I look for the sight, and not what I bite

Stoplight
Ape-like attention
Stoplight
Ape-like attention

I'm not gonna do while looking at you
I look for the sight, and not what I bite

Meet me in the back and you'll find out why
I was dancing to your house last Wednesday night
I caught a little word of something you said
Now I can't let little prose come out of my head, ha

Ape-like attention
Stoplight
Ape-like attention

I'm not gonna do while looking at you
I look for the sight, and not what I bite

I'm not gonna do while looking at you
I look for the sight, and not what I bite
