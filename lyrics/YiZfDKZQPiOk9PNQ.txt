I found your picture looking through a book
It was the one I took
When we were driving on Sunset
Descendants playing on the mixed CD
That you just made for me
You wrote "for when you miss me" on it

Can't stop myself when I listen
I always sing along
Reliving every minute
And I just can't take it

I wish that I could forget you even exist
And find a way to be without you
'Cause I miss you and I hate feeling like this
It's making me sick
Feeling nostalgic

Every year when October comes around
And it gets colder out
I grab my favorite hoodie
There's still a hole from when you borrowed it
You used to sleep in it
'Cause it reminded you of me

Can't stop myself when I'm thinking
I only see your face
Reliving every minute
And I just can't take it

I wish that I could forget you even exist
And find a way to be without you
'Cause I miss you and I hate feeling like this
It's making me sick
Feeling nostalgic
(Feeling nostalgic, nostalgic, nostalgic, nostalgic, nostalgic,)

I wish that I could forget you even exist
And find a way to be without you
'Cause I miss you and I hate feeling like this
It's making me sick
Feeling nostalgic

Maybe someday, my heart will be over it
Maybe someday, I'll be okay
But I miss you and I hate feeling like this
It's making me sick
Feeling nostalgic

Feeling nostalgic
Feeling nostalgic
It's making me sick
Feeling nostalgic
