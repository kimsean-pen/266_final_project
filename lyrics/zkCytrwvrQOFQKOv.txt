(Oh, no)
Oh lately, it's so quiet in this place
You're not 'round every corner, oh

(Oh no)
Oh lately, it's so quiet in this place
So darlin', if you're not here haunting me
I'm wondering

Whose house are you haunting tonight?
Aw, whose sheets you twist, aw, whose face you kiss
Aw, whose house are you haunting tonight?

(Oh no)
I don't think much about you anymore
(Oh no)
You're not on every whisper, oh

(Oh no)
I don't think much about you
But if you're not lurking behind every curtain
I'm wondering

Whose house, are you haunting tonight?
Aw, whose name you hiss, aw, whose clenching fists
Aw, whose house are you haunting tonight?

Now whose house are you haunting tonight?
Aw, who can't resist, aw, whose cryin'
Whose house are you haunting tonight?

Aw, whose name you hiss, aw, whose sheets you twist
Aw, whose house are you haunting tonight?
Oh no
