Somehow we're sent by fools
No better when we're lost
I fell into your shoes
But only one

Hoping to be shown, a leaner curfew
Hopeful senseless sins, gathering clues
Weaving into, feeding off the youth

Somehow we're sent by fools
No better when we're lost
I fell into your shoes
But only one

The skies are overwhelmed, another teacher
Heads for higher ground, gathering clues
Weaving into
Feeding off the youth

Closing chapters tell of, a final virtue
Pay for healing as, eyes go hollow
Weaving into
We bring this to you

Somehow we're sent by fools
No better when we're lost
I fell into your shoes
But only one

Somehow we're sent by fools
No better when we're lost
I fell into your shoes
But only one
