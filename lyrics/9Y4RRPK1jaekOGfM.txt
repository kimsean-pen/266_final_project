Don't make me dream about you
Don't make me dream about you
Don't make me dream about you
Don't make me dream about you

I dream in daytime and night time
I dream of love or romance
It won't be nice if they catch me
But I can live with the chance

Because I love you
Because I want you
I will win your love for me, yeah
I will win your love for me

Looked so sweet when I met you
Now you're acting so bold
Feels so hot when I kiss you
And now you come on cold

And I still love you
I still want you
And I will win your love for me, yeah
I will win your love for me

No, no, no

Don't make me dream about you
Don't make me dream about you
Don't make me dream about you
Don't make me dream about you

Took a chance when I met you
I should have known I would lose
I know it's wrong I should leave you
You make it so hard to choose

And I still love you
I still want you
And I will win your love for me, yeah
I will win your love for me

No, no, no

Don't make me dream about you
Don't make me dream about you
Don't make me dream about you
Don't make me dream about you
Don't make me dream
Don't make me dream
