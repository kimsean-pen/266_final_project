Here tonight I clock a thousand heads
Here to unite, through common dreads
Now who's with me?
Now who's with me?

Something trips inside
That's been dormant for a thousand years
Now we can no longer hide
The immediacy of these fears

Our names will not be writ on water
And we don't need an ark
One day I know the dam will collapse
And we will be the current
Yes, what have you got for me?

And now the flood gates will open
Strike
You cannot open the door
You cannot open the door

We will sing as one in solidarity
We will swim together
No longer treading water
We're flowing with the tide

And you can taste the night
Don't waste the night
We will sing as one in solidarity
We will sing together

And still we will be here
Standing like statues
The time is now, belt it brothers

We will sing as one in solidarity
We will sing together
We will sing as one in solidarity
We will sing together

We will sing as one in solidarity
We will sing together
We will sing as one in solidarity
We will sing together
