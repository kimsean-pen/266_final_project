Please tell me somebody's up there
And why I'm even singing at all
A crowded room that no one's in
Stealing all my oxygen
Holding on just to let it go

Every minute is a memory that
Your silence can be deafening
With every bond you break
You break me down

So carve my name out
Look what it's like to fall apart
So far away now
Already ruined from the start
And you're not forgiven
And I'm not for giving up

Please tell me somebody's out there
Yeah, I already know what you'll say
That you're overrated
Burned out and faded
No one can save me now

You hold me up, just to bring me down
Where no one can hear me screaming
You hold me up, just to bring me down
So why can't you hear me?
I'm right where you left me

So carve my name out
Look what it's like to fall apart
So far away now
Already ruined from the start
And you're not forgiven
And I'm not for giving up

Are we ashes in the fire
Or will we rise above the flames?

So carve my name out
Look what it's like to fall apart
So far away now
Already ruined from the start

So carve my name out
Look what it's like to fall apart
So far away now
Already ruined from the start
And you're not forgiven
And I'm not forgetting
That you're not the reason
That I'm not for giving up
