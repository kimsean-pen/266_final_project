How does it work?
How do you do this to someone?
Oh, as if you had no choice?

I'm drownin' in my headspace
Drivin' shockpoint like I'm Isaac Clarke in Dead Space
Two gram cone to my dome, now I'm dead, wait
I feel fine, celebratin' poppin' champaigne
Caught me in my zone, all alone, marijuana on my lip
Fixin' for the herb, I'm packin' purple 'till I'm stiff
Fall asleep in chairs or couches I don't give a shit
Lil' sleepy boy, I'm overlookin' on a clip
This that fuckin' cliffnote
Cliff bars suck and clifford the dog was a nympho
Breakin' 'till it fall apart, I guess you got the memo
Good bye to my hello
I was once a shade of blue but you turned to me yellow
My color palette is minimum but I don't give a fuck
Flip it 'till it's saturated, the vibrance ain't enough
Been awake for days and I'm amazed that I'm still up
Sleep is for the weak and I'm afraid of givin' up

Yeah, I'm afraid of givin' up
Yeah, I'm afraid of givin' up
Yeah, I'm afraid of givin' up
Yeah, I'm afraid of givin' up
