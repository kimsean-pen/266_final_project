I'm coming out from the hollows
And I'm dropping my halo
I'm gonna keep my head low, oh-oh yeah
We can dance in a meadow
No sheets, no pillows
Rhythm, they can move slow, oh-oh yeah

I don't need your love
I just want to change
I'm in a rush, remedy, remedy
We can stay right here
And make the world escape
We're gonna send your loss
So take your seat, take your seat

Nothing ever good happens at the 3AM
That's when me and you, come and come and love again
Touching in the darkness with the people watch us
We don't have to bring it back down
Nothing ever good happens at the 3AM (3AM)

We're getting rough like criminals
And turning wild like animals
Lose it all in the formal, oh-oh yeah
We pushing high, make it levitate
Make it feeling no hesitation
Make it feeling no hesitation, no
No no no no no no

Nothing ever good happens at the 3AM
That's when me and you, come and come and love again, yeah
Touching in the darkness with the people watch us
We don't have to bring it back down
Nothing ever good happens at the 3AM (3AM)

3AM
3AM

Take my heart and take my pain
Take me deep into your wicked ways
Just one more touch
One more touch

I don't need your love
I just want to change
I'm in a rush, remedy, remedy
We can stay right here
And make the world escape
We're gonna send your loss
So take your seat, take your seat

Nothing ever good happens at the 3AM
That's when me and you, come and come and love again
Touching in the darkness with the people watch us
We don't have to bring it back down
Nothing ever good happens at the 3AM (3AM)

Nothing ever good happens at the 3AM
That's when me and you, come and come and love again, yeah
Touching in the darkness with the people watch us
We don't have to bring it back down
Nothing ever good happens at the 3AM (3AM)

3AM
3AM
