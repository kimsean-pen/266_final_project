All our loose ends
Are gathered here inside this house
You left me here to sort them out
But its not all yours really
I kept a few to hold onto
I tied them to my wrists and you said:
"Does it feel watered down?"
"Does it feel over now?"
"Do you feel watered down?"
"Do you feel older now?"
"Does it feel watered down?"
"Does it feel over now?"
You hated when i said
You needed anything, you didn't
I walked into your room
And took it all
You hated when i said
You needed anything, you didn't
I walked into your room
And took it all
"Does it feel watered down?"
"Does it feel over now?"
