If it stayed i'd never leave it
If that turned around
I'd grieve the special dirty things that we used to talk about
I mean that loving you is strange
And adored by me throughout oh no it's you again
Someday soon you'll find that someone
Waiting for the chance to beat you
Drooling on the set to feel you
Blessing you with every kiss

Tying yourself to me
Stitch up my emptiness cause your the death of me
So precious loving the thrill
Tying yourself to me
Stitch up my emptiness cause your the death of me
So precious loving the thrill

Such the patient one who needs me
The spoiled one who wins
So shocking where's your sense
Don't you know i hate you, ohoh
Unsatisfied, you little girl.

Tying yourself to me
Stitch up my emptiness cause your the death of me
So precious loving the thrill
Tying yourself to me
Stitch up my emptiness cause your the death of me
So precious loving the thrill

Rolling dice and seeming queer
Bastard love, a sick affair
Let's see what new disease you'll fetch
I mean that fucking you is strange
And adored by me throughout
Oh no it's you again
Blessing you with every kiss

So precious you know this hate of mine exploded
I'm so deranged you know
I will never be the same

Tying yourself to me
Stitch up my emptiness cause your the death of me
So precious loving the thrill
Tying yourself to me
Stitch up my emptiness cause your the death of me
So precious loving the thrill
