I woke up thirsty on an island in the sea
I woke up hungry with hungry cougars surrounding me

I hit the soft spot on the soft spot on my head
it made me tired so I sung from my bed

I'm ready to die X4
a sword, a switchblade, any way you cut it
I'm not afraid, I know I'm going to get it

Oh maker! (of such fine products
as palm trees, and the dead sea)
don't pardon me, there's nothing rude
things conclude, things conclude!

as I slurred that chorus, the ghosts got biggie
small sounds like a drill
the death sweat suits me
a death threat provides a thrill

I've seen the world, kissed all the pretty girls
I've said my goodbyes and now I'm ready to die.
