Hey,
you talk to fast and
I don't know what you said Last,
I thank you for words
I've never heard like Flabbergast
I feel like green around your
perfect painted blue
I feel like sugar in the water
next to you

Call shotgun
Yeah I want one
Call shotgun
Yeah I want one too
But I'm only calling shotgun
To sit next to you

Babe, you're an hour late and
I can't help my thunder face
Cause you're the lightbulb and
I'm the switch and you're disgraced
Yeah I wish that I was not a sucker
For the way
That you wear board shorts
in the winter
make it okay

Call shotgun
Yeah I want one
Call shotgun
Yeah I want one too
but I'm only calling shotgun
To sit next to you

Ooo
What do I do
They told me not to fall
for boys like you
Green shoes, hair loose,
Never smells like perfume
Ooo
what do I do

Call shotgun!
Call shotgun
Yeah I want one
Call shotgun
Yeah I want one too
But I'm only calling shotgun
to sit next to you
