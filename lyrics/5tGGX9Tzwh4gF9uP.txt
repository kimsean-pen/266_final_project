Come
Eeach effort to rise makes us heavier
Each failed endeavor tightens the noose
As we reach for the stars
They don't seem to get closer
They just stare and glitter
And the stone keps pulling down
Until our necks start to break
With cracking sound of relief
And crimson tears run from our eyes
As we refuse to submit
No!
Pull me down no more!
I â€“ lost within and broken without
Fractured spirit in search fo reconnection
With the light coming through the darkness
With the darkness hidden behind the light
There is a price for every thruth unveiled
For each step forward, two steps back are a must
There is a purpose in every wound we recive
And our hearts shall turn into maps
One scar at a time
Come to me, stand by me, pierce through my heart as I scream
Become one with my sul and my mind
As I paint my world black to resemble your eyes
Staring at me at night, while I am staring back
My dearest enemy
Lesser twin, rejected child
Twisted reflection in a broken mirror
Or my face incarnate?
Craving for a chance to become
Integrated and whole
I live, I lie, I kill, I die
I am the punishment, I am the crime
I am the one with the darkest void of mine
And I urn
Whatever it takes to progress
Do I carry the shadow
Or does shadow carry me... down?
The more I try to keep it concealed
The more of it slips away
Another look within I take
Another step beyond the veil
Another glimpse of what's to come
Of what was hidden all along
Another chance to see my hands
So I pull off my velvet gloves
Another face to gaze upon
But this time it is my own
