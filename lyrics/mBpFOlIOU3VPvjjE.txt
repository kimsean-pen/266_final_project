Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
I am God, motherfuckers! Better bow down!

Dead bodies all around, hundred rounds out
Smell it in the air every time I fuck around town (downtown)
Lay down, one by one I pick 'em off without sound
Choppa have my back, Grey slap hold on for the blade ($uicide!)
Your chain snatched, I like the way it shines
When I'm back the black blood diamonds
glisten and hit the victims yell (what?)

Death requires singing all the songs of fucking hell
As I hear the voices swell I know the demons wish me well (yeah)
Bath salts in the nose, feel like eatin' a fucker's face
Now I'm speedin in the bronco like it's 1998
Take away the cameras, motherfucker, now it's war time
Behind enemy lines, PTSD just means I'm high
Bring me life, bring me life, so I can end it on my own time
Meeting the reaper, all they tryna take me off the frontlines
I just want some peace of mind, sick and tired of feelin' tired

I declare war, armageddon, let us swarm
I'll bring the fucking storm, bury me in uniform, yeah
Fall under the rising sun
G9 the time has come
Watch the blood you maggot scum
Feel the end as I return

Tonight we die, grey flags, wave 'em on
Point your guns up at the sky, yelling "We know God is done!"
Partisan with fucking fur
Smokin' ash all in my arm
It's war time, motherfucking time, now I wanna die

Follow me, we can meet the other side
Take anyone and rip out their spine
Leave 'em behind and repeat 'til we die
Grey9 army we bleed 'till we die
6 feets deep in my enemies, kill them all
Burn it all they're not new friends to me
Bitch I'm in graves of the grave as I look and see
We were all too brand new all an accident
Peace it will never be I used to lie in the seats under beneath
The ground shoot off our brow I'll see bleed out the lense while pressing my hand while he bury me in the sea and try not to forget

Hell no, we won't go, hell no, we won't go
Try not to forget me, I'll become a ghost and haunt you daily
Hell no, we won't go, hell no, we won't go
Die until you remember me daily
Hell no, we won't go, hell no, we won't go, hell no, we won't go
