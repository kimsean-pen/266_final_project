What's the wave right now?
Been down all day and I feel like I could take one down
Got a lot on my mind and I just can't seem to point it out
Gonna need something to hold me down

Now I feel like I could take the sky with me
Say what's on my mind, I got the fire in me
I can feel the music running through my body
Makes me feel like I could take the sky with me
Said I wanna get down, get down
I wanna get, get, get
Get down, get down
I wanna get, get, get
Get down, get down
I wanna get, get, get
Get down, get down, get down

Everybody's looking for a way out
Everybody's looking for a way out

Way out, so I let her in
I know that I'm better than the other man
Men blowin' away
Ain't no way bae
I'm it, I'm this, [?]
Right now, get down
Trap scat: swoo-do-divi-do

Now I feel like I could take the sky with me
Say what's on my mind, I got the fire in me
I can feel the music running through my body
Makes me feel like I could take the sky with me
Said I wanna get down, get down
I wanna get, get, get
Get down, get down
I wanna get, get, get
Get down, get down
I wanna get, get, get
Get down, get down, get down

Everybody's looking for a way out
Everybody's looking for a way out

What's the wave right now?
I've been down and I'm up
And I wanna erupt
And take one down
I can't see what I need
And I feel empty
I'm fading now
And I need something to hold me down

Now I feel like I could take the sky with me
Say what's on my mind, I got the fire in me
I can feel the music running through my body
Makes me feel like I could take the sky with me
Said I wanna get down, get down
I wanna get, get, get
Get down, get down
I wanna get, get, get
Get down, get down
I wanna get, get, get
Get down, get down, get down
