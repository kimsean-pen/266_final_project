Sparrow and wolf lay as still as the blades of the grass
Like worn leather boots, of color and size that would last
Caught them a lark in a trap and each held a wing
Then they tore it apart, before that small bird could sing

Confused by the wind, bruised by the size of the rain
She turned back to him, begged for love to remain
But plans have been made, all of your furniture sold
So just store up your hate, use for warmth when you're cold

For I have seen no joy, only danger
I seen no joy, only strangers
I seen no joy, seen no joy in this world
Should you choose to go
Please be careful of lonesome roads
Men who travel them will not know
Will not know of your ways, oh, oh, oh, oh

Still I have seen no joy, only dangers
I seen no joy, only strangers
I seen no joy, seen no joy in this world
Should you choose to go
Please be faithful of what you learn
From the little bird always dear
Always dear to my heart, oh, oh, oh, oh
