I still believe in your eyes
I just don't care what you've done in your life
Baby, I'll always be here by your side
Don't leave me waiting too long
Please, come by

I still believe in your eyes
There is no choice
I belong to your life
Because I need to love you
One day you'll be my baby
And we'll fly away
And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

You, you, you

Every day and every night
I always dream that you are by my side
Oh, baby, every day and every night
Well, I said everything's gonna be alright
And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

You, you

I still believe in your eyes
I just don't care what you've done in your life
Baby, I'll always be here by your side
Don't leave me waiting too long
Please, come by

I still believe in your eyes
There is no choice
I belong to your life
Because I need to love you
One day you'll be my baby
And we'll fly away
And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

Every day and every night
I always dream that you are by my side
Oh, baby, every day and every night
Well, I said everything's gonna be alright
And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

You, you
