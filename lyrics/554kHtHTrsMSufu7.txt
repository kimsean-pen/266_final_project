Get a grip on yourself,
get in shape for tonight

Take a look at yourself or your dreams
you're losing sight
It just ain't right. It just ain't right

Hey man, look at me, I'm screaming
Are you watching me bleed, are you beleiving'

You got to stick to your guns
What's right for you, ain't right for everyone
Ain't right for everyone
You got to stick to your guns
What's right for you, ain't right for everyone
Ain't right for everyone

Too much too soon. too much for you
Everyday has a hero, don't it though
Don't let it go
You got to fight, it just ain't right Hey man, look at me, I'm screaming
Are you watching me bleed, are you beleiving'

You got to stick to your guns
What's right for you, ain't right for everyone
Ain't right for everyone
You got to stick to your guns
What's right for you, ain't right for everyone
Ain't right for everyone

Hey man, look at me, I'm screaming
Are you watching me bleed, are you beleiving'
You got to stick to your guns
What's right for you, ain't right for everyone
Ain't right for everyone
You got to stick to your guns
What's right for you, ain't right for everyone
Ain't right for everyone
