Pretty baby
Grew into a lady
The people don't know what your mama know, they don't
Pretty baby
In the light of the dawn
A pretty babe was born
Her mother, she had sworn to take good care of her
Every night, Mum would pray
Her life would not be torn
Her clothes would not be worrn until they dropped off of her

My child, you dear
Don't have no fear
I'll shed the tears
Keep your head clear, my pretty baby
