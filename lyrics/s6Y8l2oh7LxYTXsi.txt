Nobody gets Too Much Heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Ooh, you and me, girl
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more

And, my love
I can see beyond forever
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Oh, you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away

Nobody gets Too Much Heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

You and me, girl
Got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night or day
And the tears we had to cry

You're my life
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing, oh
When you are to me
The light above

Made for all to see
Our precious love
Nobody gets Too Much Heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Love is such a beautiful thing

Oh, you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away

Nobody gets Too Much Heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Oh, oh, oh

Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
Oh, oh, oh

Nobody gets Too Much Heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
