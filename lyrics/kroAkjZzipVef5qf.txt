It's not my fault I look better in her party dress
It's not my fault that she left her slutty girlfriend
It's not my fault, this is how my momma made me
I've been magnetic since I was a baby.

It's not my fault I look cuter in his boxing gloves
It's not my fault that she left you for my shining tongue
It's not my fault this is how my daddy made me
I've been magnetic since I was a baby,

I've been magnetic since I was a baby!

It's not my fault, I would never hurt anyone
It's not my fault, the damage was already done
It's not my fault, this is how I, I, I made me
I've been magnetic since I was a baby.

As I cross the city, on my feet
A helicopter shot a searchlight down the street
And as the empires say turn the sky green
All that I could say was, shine the light on me!

It's not my fault some people wish I was dead
It's not my fault my precious little hands are red
It's not my fault they pushed so hard they made me
I've been magnetic since i was a baby.

I've been magnetic since I was a baby!
