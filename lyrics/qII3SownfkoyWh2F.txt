I'm not listening to you
I am wandering right through existance
With no purpose and no drive
'cause in the end we're all alive, alive
Two thousand years I've been awake
Waiting for the day to shake
To all of you who've wronged me
I am, I am a zombie
Again, again you want me to fall on my head
I am, I am, I am a zombie
How low, how low, how low will you push me
To go to go to go, before I lay, lay down dead
Blow the smoke right off the tube
Kiss my gentle burning bruise
I'm lost in time
To all the people left behind
You are walking dumb and blind, blind
And two thousand years I've been awake
Waiting for the day to shake
Dear all of you who've wronged me
I am, I am a zombie
Again, again you want me to fall on my head
I am, I am, I am a zombie
How low, how low, how low will you push me
To go, to go, to go, before I lay, lay down dead
Oh dead, Oh dead, Oh dead
To all of you who've wronged me
I am, I am a zombie
Again, again you want me to fall on my head
I am I am I am a zombie
How low, how low, how low will you push me
To go, to go, to go, before I lay down dead
