Why should I know, why should I care?
That a tiny little thing, like the sun will once will be gone
I'm sure it won't be until long
Besides you and I will both be gone

I should be digging my way to China
with a shovel
But winded up in Portugal
Oh it's a long way to crawl
And I missed the earth and its blue walls

But when I pop my head up in Hiroshima
Heaven is just like earth only upside down
And I carelessly walk around
I carelessly walk around

Nananana.

But when I pop my head up in Hiroshima
Heaven is just like earth only upside down
And I carelessly walk around
I carelessly walk around

But when I pop my head up in Hiroshima
But when I pop my head up in Hi-ro-shima
And i carelessly walk around
I carelessly walk around

But when I pop my head up in Hiroshima
But when I pop my head up in Hi-ro-shima

I carelessly walk around
I carelessly walk around

Nananana...
