Pour my tea, pour my thoughts, into seperate beds
Spilling out, into clouds, whirling like a pirouette
Every breath, every cross, everywhere I turn
In my head, stitching thread, until my temples burn
From the crease, of your mouth, to the picket fences
All the space, stretching out, blurring my defenses
Dignity, diligence, I cannot avenge
Sink my teeth, in the sheets, and taste the emptiness
Love is sweet, love is dark, and it pulls
Your world apart, so you can grow
Now I see, perfectly
Oh, how it's clear
What I needed the most was you here

If I ever let you down, If I ever let you down
If I ever let you down, If I ever let you down

Spend my time, spend my dime, waiting for the train
All of these, memories, float around and ricochet
Like a storm, that is thrown, out over the sea
As I roll, as I grow, tougher than I used to be
Love is sweet, and it calls, you again
To bring back, from where you've been
Now, I see perfectly
Through all the fear
What I needed the most was you here

If I ever let you down, If I ever let you down
If I ever let you down, If I ever let you down
If I ever let you down, If I ever let you down
If I ever let you down, If I ever let you down

You will feel my love
When the times comes
Hear me say:
"You will feel my love,
When the time comes."
And you say:
"Never be the same as before.
It'll never be the same, I deserve much more."
Hard for me to blame you, my love
So, so, ooh

If I ever let you down, If I ever let you down
If I ever let you down, If I ever let you down
If I ever let you down, If I ever let you down
If I ever let you down, If I ever let you down
