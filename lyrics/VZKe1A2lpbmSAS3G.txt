I only see one thing
In this world that I need
No war coming from me
Just want the love's chemistry
Good vibes and inner-key
Is all I feel surrounding
If it's not on your level
Then why don't you just let it be

Said, all we really need (Yeah)
Is better energy (Yeah-ooooh)
Said, all we really need (Yeah, yeah-eee-yeaah)
Is better energy

I only see one thing
In this world that I need
No war coming from me
Just want the love's chemistry
Good vibes and inner-key
Is all I feel surrounding
If it's not on your level
Then why don't you just let it be

I got that energy, energy
Exactly what I need
If you feeling me, feeling me
Then we got some chemistry
I can only see one thing
That's the energy in me
Even though I want you near me
Check me, I can make you leave
I can lead a horse to water
But I fail to make one drink
I'mma call you Sleeping Beauty
Cause you perfect, but you sleep
Granny told me love is fate
But for sure it's nothing cheap
So for now, just keep on zoning
Girl, I dig ya energy
