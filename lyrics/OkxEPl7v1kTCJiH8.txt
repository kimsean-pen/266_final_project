And you measure for wealth by the things you can hold
And you measure for love by the sweet things you're told
And you live in the past of a dream that you're in
And your selfishness is your cardinal sin

And you want to be held with highest regard
If he likes you so much
If he's trying so hard
And you're trying to conceal your ordinary way
With a smile or a shrug
Or some stolen cliche

But don't you understand
And don't you look about
I'm trying to take nothing from you
So why should you act so put out, for me

'Cause emotionally, you're the same basic trip
And you know that I know of the times that you've slipped
So don't try to impress me
You're just pins and paint
And don't try to charm me
With things that you ain't

And don't try to enchant me with your manner of dress
'Cause a monkey in silk is a monkey no less
So measure for measure, reflect on my said
And when I won't see 'ya then measure it dead

'Cause don't you understand
And don't you look about
I'm trying to take nothing from you
So why should you act so put out
And sit there and wonder in doubt, for me
