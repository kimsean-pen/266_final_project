I trust you, my baby girl
Make a decision that
You wanna live with her
You break my heart,
With every call
You'll break my heart and
You will always break them all

Leave me alone
At the record shop
I wish that I could drop
I wish that I could
Drop a million bucks
Leave me alone
At the record shop

Don't let the record stop
It gets me high-igh-igh-igh

Leave me alone
At the record shop
I wish that I could drop
I wish that I could
Drop a million bucks
Leave me alone
At the record shop

Don't let the record stop
It gets me high-igh-igh-igh

I love you, my baby girl
You have a sentience
Like anybody, though
The consequence
Of someone else
A heavy burden that
I place upon myself

Leave me alone
At the record shop
I wish that I could drop
I wish that I could drop a million bucks
Leave me alone at the record shop
Don't let the record stop
It gets me high-igh-igh-igh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Give me a song
That'll contrast the melody
Give me a song
With a three part holiday
Give me a song
That'll contrast the melody
Give me a song
With a three part holiday

Leave me alone
At the record shop
I wish that I could drop
I wish that I could
Drop a million bucks

Leave me alone
At the record shop
Don't let the record stop
It gets me high-igh-igh-igh

Leave me alone
At the record shop
I wish that I could drop
I wish that I could
Drop a million bucks

Leave me alone
At the record shop
Don't let the record stop
It gets me high-igh-igh-igh
