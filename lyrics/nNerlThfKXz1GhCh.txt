When I was a boy
I didn't care 'bout a thing
It was me and this world
And a broken dream
I was blaming myself
For all that was going wrong

I was way out there
On the wrong side of town
And the ones that I loved
I started pushing 'em out
Then I realized
That it was all my fault

I've been looking for a lifeline
For what seems like a lifetime
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline

So I put out my hand
And I asked for some help
We tore down the walls
I built around myself
I was struck by the light
And I fell to the ground

I've been looking for a lifeline
For what seems like a lifetime
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline

Is there anybody out there
Can you pull me from this ocean of despair
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline

You know a heart of gold
Won't take you all the way
And in a world so cold
It's hard to keep the faith
I'm never gonna fade away

Yeah

I've been looking for a lifeline (Looking for a lifeline)
For what seems like a lifetime (Seems like a lifetime)
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline (Looking for a lifeline)
Is there anybody out there (Anybody out there)
Can you pull me from this ocean of despair
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline (Looking for a lifeline)
