Do what I have to do to get myself in
I know I never had a heart of gold
And now I'm crawling in and out of your skin
I only open doors that I can't close

I, I wanna learn you
All from the inside
So, you won't forget
Right, right when I burned you
I felt the last cry
There was nothing left

I tried to make you my own
I tried to make you my own
I tried to make you my own
I tried to make you my own

Sometimes I feel that I am what I deserve
A hundred crimes, no way to pay them off
So when quiet fills the night and you hurt
Know I am sorry for all that you lost

I, I had to learn you
All from the inside
My deepest regret
Right, right when I burned you
I made the last cry
I'm all that is left

I tried to make you my own

I tried to make you my own
I tried to make you my own
I tried to make you my own
I tried to make you my own

I don't know myself

Do what I have to do to get myself in
Do what I have to do to get myself in
