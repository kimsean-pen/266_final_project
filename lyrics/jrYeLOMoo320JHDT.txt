There's a riot in everyone!

They think they can hold us down forever.
But no one can beat us out of phase.
We live hard, creating all the terror.
The government is shaded by our craze.

Won't take shit from no one
Breakin' free, never stop.
Living rabid in the everland .

We're the kids of the underground
There's a riot in everyone
We're the kids of the underground
And we're loud as we tear 'em down

We're the kids of the underground
There's a feeling you can't deny
There's a feeling you can't deny.
'Cause there's a riot in everyone.

They say you should live as you are told to
I say you gotta be strong and make up your own mind
Be your self not a puppet in their freak show
'Cause that's the way you'll end up when they beat you blind

Wont take shit from anyone, no one!
Never played by the rules
'Cause we're the kids of the underground

We're the kids of the underground
There's a riot in everyone
We're the kids of the underground
And we're loud as we tear 'em down

We're the kids of the underground
There's a feeling you can't deny
There's a feeling you can't deny.
'Cause there's a riot in everyone.

Our time, our way,
We're the wasted generation
Our life, we pay,
With our nasty reputation

We will always be living free
Always on top of the misery
To live hard is a luxury
And to die of our prophecy

We're the kids of the underground
We're the kids of the underground
And we're loud as we tear 'em down

We're the kids of the underground
There's a riot in everyone
We're the kids of the underground
There's a riot in everyone

We're the kids of the underground
There's a riot in everyone
We're the kids of the underground
There's a riot in everyone

We're the kids of the underground
There's a feeling you can't deny
There's a feeling you can't deny.
'Cause there's a riot in everyone.
