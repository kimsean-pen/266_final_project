Don't tell your right hand baby
What your left hand do
You know those road check girls
Will make your brown breath blue

Peaches and Cream
You make a garbage man scream
Such a dangerous dream
Peaches and Cream.

You look good in that sweater
And that aluminum crutch
I'm gonna let you down easy
I've got a delicate touch

Peaches and Cream
You make a garbage man scream
Come on girl it's a dream

You're a torn out page
From a best selling book
Your home girl's on the line
But your daddy's off the hook
Where do we go now?

Give those pious soldiers
Another lollipop
Cause we're on the good ship
Menage et tois
Peaches and Cream
You make a garbage man scream
Such a delicate thing

Keep your lamplight trimmed and burning
