Mayla, long time
Mayla, sunshine
Mayla, know I'm
Tryin' to see it through
My future to the new horizon

Mayla, long time
Mayla, sunshine
Hold up, we're tryin'
Our hands are bleeding through
We're building us a new horizon

Mmmm
Mmmm
Mayla, long time
Mayla, sunshine
Mayla, we're tryin'
Our hands are bleeding through
And messses up with you and falling

Ahhh
And all I have to do to rise
Is look into your eyes

Mayla, long time
Mayla, sunshine
Mayla, know I'm
Tryin' to see it through
My future to the new horizon

Mmmm
Mmmm
