I don't wanna hear about any other lovers I don't wanna mess around
underneath the covers With anyone that isn't you,
cause you're beautiful And we're suitable I don't wanna hear about
any other lover I don't wanna mess around underneath the covers
With anyone that isn't you,
cause you're beautiful And we're suitable.
Talking to someone,
I think they're buying a house Avoiding the subject of what I'm up to
now I've turned my head across the room In time to see you smiling at
something, at someone Just sad,
and you are my everything Chorus Hold hands with old bands and
monkeys in the zoo The makeup is running,
and I am running too Counting the days till I return in tiptoe back
into your love life And the wild eye of home Cause you are my
everything Saying it,
saying it slow I will never let you go Saying it,
saying it slow I will never let you go Saying it,
saying it slow I will never let you go Saying it,
saying it slow Cause you are my everything Chorus
Saying it, saying it slow I will never let you go
