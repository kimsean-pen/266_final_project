I bought a sequined suit from a pearly queen
She could drink more wine than I'd ever seen
She had some gypsies' blood flowing through her feet
And when the time was right she said that I would meet my destiny

I traveled round the world to find the sun
I couldn't stop myself from having fun
And then one day I met an Indian girl
And she made me forget this troubled world we're living in, yeah

I had a strange dream, in my hair
I saw a pearly queen lying there
And all around her feet flowers bloomed
But they were made of silk and sequins two by two

I bought a sequined suit from a pearly queen
She could drink more wine than I'd ever seen
She had some gypsies' blood flowing through her feet
And when the time was right she said that I would meet my destiny

I traveled round the world to find the sun
I couldn't stop myself from having fun
Then one day I met an Indian girl
And she made me forget this troubled world we're living in
