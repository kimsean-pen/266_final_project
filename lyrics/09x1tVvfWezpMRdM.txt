Just like I came into this world
all by myself, I will leave it.
I stared into the serpents eyes
And then for once I felt alive.
Just like I came into this world
all by myself, I will leave it.

And if this world wasn't built for me
there is no point at all.
Hold onto your vice and I will hold onto mine.
Think it but don't say it...
Your day will come

Twenty-seven invincible years,
where do you go where nowhere feels like home?
And I can't sleep a wink so i'll tell you when I get there.
I'll walk into the light,
but the lights fading away.
