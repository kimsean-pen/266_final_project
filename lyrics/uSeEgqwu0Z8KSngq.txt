Put poison in my favorite cup
Let it go ahead and fill me up
Cuz' the taste is all I've got
The traces of a wasted kind of love

You can cut me with a thousand knives
Just the way you've done a thousand times
If it keeps you close, then I
Would gladly let you take my life

I can't let go
Oh, I wanna
But I just don't know
What I gotta do to just let go
Oh, I wanna
But I just don't know
What I gotta do to just let go

There's a time ... light
And it's shining like the world's on fire
Just one look at you and I go blind
It will never be enough, the traces of your wasted love
Traces of your wasted kind of love

I can't let go
Oh, I wanna
But I just don't know
What I gotta do to just let go
Oh, I wanna
But I just don't know
What I gotta do to just let go
Oh, I wanna
But I just don't know

(Oh aah
I can't let go)

Sometimes, I just wanna give up
But I can't let go, can't let go
I've tried, but you've poisoned my cup
And I can't let go, can't let go

Sometimes, I just wanna give up
But I can't let go, can't let go
I've tried, but you've poisoned my cup
And I.

I can't let go
Oh, I wanna
But I just don't know

I can't let go
Oh, I wanna
But I just don't know
What I gotta do to just let go
Oh, I wanna
But I just don't know
What I gotta do to just let go
Oh, I wanna
But I just don't know

(Oh aah
I can't let go)

Sometimes, I just wanna give up
But I can't let go, can't let go
I've tried, but you've poisoned my cup
And I can't let go, can't let go

Sometimes, I just wanna give up
But I can't let go, can't let go
I've tried, but you've poisoned my cup
And I can't let go, can't let go

Sometimes, I just wanna give up
But I can't let go, can't let go
I've tried, but you've poisoned my cup
And I can't let go, can't let go
