You know my ringtone (why don't you answer the phone)
If you don't get here (I'm dancing alone)
Get in the fast lane 'cause someone will ask me
If you don't
I hear the music (I'm ready to go)
You better get here ('cause I'm dancing alone)
You better get driving and turn on the siren
'Cause you're in the danger zone

You know it's friday
Why don't you call me
You got my number
Hey I'm still waiting
Why don't you call me
Aren't you my boyfriend?
You were supposed to be here
Like an hour ago

I bought this dress for you
I got my legs so smooth
I got my manny paddy went and hot my hair done too
All dressed up and nowhere to go-oh

It's an emergency
I need you here with me
It's a 911 (911)
It's an emergency
Can't you see?
It's a 911 (911)
Dying of dance deprivation
Emotional starvation, I need resuscitation
Gettin' impatient
It's an emergency (emergency)
911 (911)

You know I told you
You can't be late now
Watching my watch tick
There goes my attitude, I'm almost over you
You were supposed to be here like an hour ago
That's what you always do, give me some lame excuse
Like you were workin', sleepin', come on baby try the truth
All dressed up and nowhere to go-oh

It's an emergency
I need you here with me
It's a 911 (911)
It's an emergency
Can't you see?
It's a 911 (911)
Dying of dance deprivation
Emotional starvation, I need resuscitation
Gettin' impatient
It's an emergency (emergency)
911 (911)

You know my ringtone (why don't you answer the phone)
If you don't get here (I'm dancing alone)
Get in the fast lane 'cause someone will ask me
If you don't
I hear the music (I'm ready to go)
You better get here ('cause I'm dancing alone)
You better get driving and turn on the siren
'Cause you're in the danger zone

It's an emergency
I need you here with me
It's a 911 (911)
It's an emergency
Can't you see?
It's a 911 (911)
Dying of dance deprivation
Emotional starvation, I need resuscitation
Gettin' impatient
It's an emergency (emergency)
911 (911)
