Come on!

You won't admit it but it's true
I'm happy without you
I turned away and let your drama pull you in
You always said I was a fool
But something carried through
I never wanna see your face again

So many problems left behind
I'm sorting out my mind
This idiot has turned into a better man
I found my soul in someone else
Who doesn't feel like hell
Who doesn't make me wanna kill myself

(No! No!) I have every right to hate you
(No! No!) I have every right to hate you

I was leaving, stop believing
Then I end up right back in your arms
Now I'm bleeding, fucking seething
I was through with you a long time ago

Some people suffer for no reason, but they're the ones to blame
So walk away, let it go and save yourself
Before you tell yourself a lie
Just tell that one goodbye
How much more can you take before you fucking die?

(No! No!) I have every right to hate you
(No! No!) I have every right to hate you

I was leaving, stop believing
Then I end up right back in your arms
Now I'm bleeding, fucking seething
I was through with you a long time ago

(No, no, no, no)
(No, no, no)

(No! No!) I have every right to hate you
(No! No!) I have every right to hate you

I was leaving, stop believing
Then I end up right back in your arms
Now I'm bleeding, fucking seething
I was through with you a long time ago

Suffer!
Suffer!
Suffer!
Suffer!
