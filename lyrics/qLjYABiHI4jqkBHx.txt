The weighted clouds coming by
Has me looking
Right here under the sky
And I left my home
Passed the evening fires
In the blink of an eye
I had closed the door behind me

The vapor of old love
Will transfigure through a veil of clarity
I sense my grave way below the mire

Sorrow will find you
Its voice has given way to mine
Heart pumps death into our heredity
Who wants to come with me

For every dream that is left behind me
I take a bow
With every war that will rage inside me
I hear the sound
Of another day in this vanishing life
Returned to dust
And every chance I've pushed away
Into the night

Time won't let go
It's got you in debt now
But it's got me crawling
All the way back to the start
I swear that I saw you there
Your hands were reaching out for mine

Sorrow will find you

For every dream that is left behind me
I take a bow
With every war that will rage inside me
I hear the sound
Of another day in this vanishing life
Returned to dust
And every chance I've pushed away
Into the night

I sense my grave way below the mire
