This time I would try harder, harder.
This time I would be better, better.
Next time you'll hit me harder, harder.
For you won't know any better, will you?

I would wait an eternity
I would wait an eternity
For a chance to be with you
For a chance to see you again

What could I say?
Slam the door, shout at me
What could I say?
Tell me to go away
What could I say?
Anything, anything
I didn't want this...

I thought time would heal all wounds
I thought time would set things straight
I thought we could start again
I thought you just needed space

I'm so sorry to disappoint you
I'm so sorry for not being there

I'm so sorry for all I've done
I'm so sorry for how I treated you
I'm so sorry for what I am
I'm so sorry to disappoint you
