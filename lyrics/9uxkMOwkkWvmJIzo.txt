i'm not so good realizing
who i can or cannot trust
it's best to keep what matters vague
with harmless lies i can adjust

i get a "d" for disappointment
now there's nothing to regret
everybody's good for something
at least you know what you won't get

i let you down again
what's another harmless lie between friends
now you can be disappointed
i thought i gave you just exactly what you wanted

i let you down again
what's another harmless lie between friends
now you can be disappointed
i thought i gave you just exactly what you wanted
