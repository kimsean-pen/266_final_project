One night with me
Stay here if you can now baby
I'll hold onto anything if I have to darling

Lost in love with you it's a pretty thing
Pretty thing oh oh
Lost in love with me could be what you need
What you need oh oh

One night (take me) with me (with you)
Stay here (I'll go) if you can now baby (baby)
I'll hold (I'll give) onto (you my) anything (everything) if I have to darling (darling)

Lost in love with you it's a pretty thing
Pretty thing oh oh
Lost in love with me could be what you need
What you need oh oh

The only thing that's keeping me from going wrong
Is you keeping me
(Lost in love, lost in love, lost in love...)
And the only thing that's holding me from going wrong
Is you holding me

Lost in love with you it's a pretty thing
Pretty thing oh oh
Lost in love with me could be what you need
What you need oh oh

(Lost in love...)
Lost in love with you it's a pretty thing
Pretty thing oh oh
Lost in love with me could be what you need
What you need oh oh
