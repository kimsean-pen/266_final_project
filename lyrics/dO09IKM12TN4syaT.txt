I always knew this day would come
We'd be standing one by one
With our future in our hands
So many dreams, so many plans

I always knew after all these years
There'd be laughter, there'd be tears
But never thought I'd walk away
With so much joy, but so much pain
And it's so hard to say "goodbye"

But yesterday's gone
We gotta keep moving on
I'm so thankful for the moments
So glad I got to know you

The times that we had
I'll keep like a photograph
And hold you in my heart forever
I'll always remember you

Another chapter in the book
Can't go back, but you can look
And there we are on every page
Memories I'll always save

Up ahead on the open doors
Who knows what we're heading towards?
I wish you love, I wish you luck
For you, the world just opens up
But it's so hard to say "goodbye"

Yesterday's gone
We gotta keep moving on
I'm so thankful for the moments
So glad I got to know you

The times that we had
I'll keep like a photograph
And hold you in my heart forever
I'll always remember you

Everyday that we had
All the good, all the bad
I'll keep ‘em here inside

All the times that we shared
Every place, everywhere
You touched my life

Yeah, one day, we'll look back
We'll smile and we'll laugh
But right now we just cry
‘Cause it's so hard to say "goodbye"

Yesterday's gone
We gotta keep moving on
I'm so thankful for the moments
So glad I got to know you

The times that we had
I'll keep like a photograph
And hold you in my heart forever
I'll always remember you

I'll always remember you
Yeah, hey, yeah, yeah
I'll always remember you
