And you said I'll be your new friend
Because it's summer after all
And we will soon be stuck in fall and I might
Wonder where you've been
Because tomorrow is a promise that'll break when it begins

Blazing in the outfield, cologne in the car
Sneaking into movies, pleading with the actress
We're the coolest kids you're never gonna meet

(What do you think of me?)

But when I bring her to the reunion
In a letter jacket, you know
It'll be for the team
It'll be for the team
When I bring her to the reunion
In a letter jacket, you know
It'll be for the team
It'll be for the team
It'll be for the team

(What do you think of me?)

And you said I'll be your new friend
Because it's summer after all
And we will soon be stuck in fall and I might
Wonder where you've been
Because tomorrow is a promise that'll break when it begins

When I bring her to the reunion
In a letter jacket, you know
It'll be for the team
It'll be for the team
When I bring her to the reunion
In a letter jacket, you know
It'll be for the team
It'll be for the team

Because it's summer after all
And we will soon be stuck in fall and I might
Fall and I might
Fall and I might
(It'll be for the team)

Because tomorrow is a promise that'll break when it begins
Blazing in the outfield, cologne in the car
