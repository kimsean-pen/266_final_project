you said you didn't notice me.
i said to myself i shouldn't go.
you said i didn't seem that weird. (after all these years)
but in me i felt you said that just because you hate silence.

why do you have to push yourself?
this wound is more an infection, that seems becoming a hole.
all this has got a hold on me and dragges me to where i'm losing my mind.

this wound is more an infection, that seems becoming a hole.

instead of a progress, you seem to have lost me.
i gave you a mixtape, you gave me a scar.

(staring, i'm staring down at my feet. don't even dare to raise my head.
one look from your eyes and i just don't know what to say. and i know you hate that.
so i leave my body right there, walking backwards in my footsteps.
and i watch our mouths take part in some pointless discussion)

(choking on my words)

even if i were to be honest with you now,
even if i were enable to tell lies
i keep my hopes to myself,
i've never said that i wished for anything more than this.
i keep my hopes to myself, i've never said that i wished for anything more than this.
watching you.
go, away from me.
