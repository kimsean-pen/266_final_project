She took the fire as she was leaving
No forgiveness and no confession
Now I'm sifting through the cold grey ashes
Looking for peace in my redemption

She was my secret and I was a sinner
Had to whisper our confession
Went to the well and looked in the mirror

Raised a glass to my redemption
How long 'till I drink from the fountain?
Redemption
How high till the top of mountain
How long, how long, am I gone
Beyond redemption

Bullets flying out of nowhere
Reaching out with no exceptions
Another preacher cries on the TV
Wants my money

And my redemption
How long 'till I drink from the fountain?
Redemption
How high to the top of the mountain?
How long, how long, am I gone
Beyond redemption

Save me
Won't somebody save me?
Down in the valley
Try to rise up
Won't somebody
Somebody
Save me?

No salvation in an empty promise
Hollow wall with no protection
I have to kneel at the altar
It's the last chance

For my redemption
How long 'till I drink from the fountain?
Redemption
How high to the top of the mountain?
How long, how long, am I gone
Oh can you hear me calling?
(My redemption)
Oh can you hear me calling?
(My redemption)
One last chance for my redemption
How long, how long, am I gone
Beyond redemption
Can you hear me calling? (Oh)
