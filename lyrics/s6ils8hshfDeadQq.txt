DEAR LIFE

Don't know if I believe in a God
Don't know if I believe there's not
Don't know if I believe in fate
Don't know if I believe we make our own way

I love, I lose
I scar when I bruise
Why, dear life?

(refrão)
Sometimes I feel you carrying me
Then I feel you letting go
No ties I'm wild. Running free
Am I a fool to think I'm in control
Should I lay back and let the time wash over me?
Or fight? Dear life.
(what do you hold for me?)

Maybe I should believe what I'm told
Maybe I should believe what glitters is gold
Maybe I should say what's on my mind
Maybe if I keep my mouth shout, I'll be fine

I hate, I burn
I'm blessed and cursed
Why, dear life?

(refrão)

The only thing I know for sure
When I'm getting out of this alive
The only thing I know for sure
We're gonna be alright
