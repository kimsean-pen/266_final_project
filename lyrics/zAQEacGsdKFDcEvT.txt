I'll never be picture perfect Beyonce
Fly like J-Lo or singing Baby like 'Shanti
I barely comb my hair, yeah, that's on a good day
I don't care what the hood say
I ain't street like Keyshia, ain't never tried to be
And I got soul in my soul but not quite like Mary
Ain't nothing really R&B about me
And I say bump what the hood say

I'm sorry I ain't in the Benzes in my videos
I'm sorry I ain't even really trying to match my clothes
I can tell you paid a figure for McQueen dibs
But I can also tell you who the King dealer is
And I got knowledge if you really want to talk about it
No, I don't trust the crowd just to walk around it
So I'm writing the letter to the industry
It says "Fuck you, signed sincerely"

Aww, yeah
Here we go again
Solo, can you tone it down? Be more like them
But everything I'm not makes me everything I am

Aww, yeah
Ooh, here we go again
People talking shit but when the shit hits the fan
Everything I'm not makes me everything I am

I'm not a goody-goody, so I don't watch my mouth like I'm a goody-goody
But I appreciate the ones who rooting for me
'Cause everybody gon' gone, got an opinion, baby
And I been feeling lately like I can't help it
Big up haters, if you don't like it, I didn't make it for you ooh, ooh (You ooh, ooh)
I'm not apologetic, if you don't like it, it's probably 'cause you don't get it
And you can tell the world that you heard I said it
And I ain't talking about me, I'm talking 'bout the ones who represent what I believe
The fresh kids, the what comes next kids
The see you at the art exhibit, oh, hell yes kid
The politic kids, the be your thing and declare your independence kids
If I'm a vote for something, I'm a go Barack the vote this year
I'm talking 'bout the ones who said enough
The I got too much I don't give a what in my cup
The I don't care what the next man is saying
I'm just saying to the industry, this is fuck you, signed sincerely

Oh, yeah
Oh, here we go again
People talking shit but I don't give a damn
Everything I'm not makes me everything I am

Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Oh, here we go again
People talking shit with no pot to piss in
But everything I'm not is everything I can

I can do anything
I remember the Doc saying, "What you gon' do? Girl, you 17"
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
'Ye ripped on this track, made it into a jam
I just borrowed it just to tell you who I am
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
