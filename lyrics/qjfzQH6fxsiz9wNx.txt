In the wasteland
On the way to the Red Queen
It's no wonder our stage clothes
Have dreams to be famous

The trees in the courtyard
Are painted in blood
So I've heard

She hangs the headless
Upside down to drain
EAT ME, DRINK ME
This is only a game

This is only a game
I was invited to
A beheading today
I thought I was a butterfly
Next to your flame

A rush of panic and
The lock has been raped

This is only a game
This is only a game
But then our star rushes in
Feeling like a child and looking

Like a woman
She has been forecast with an
Attempt to kill herself
But the ending didn't test well
EAT ME, DRINK ME

This is only a game
I was invited to
A beheading today
I thought I was a butterfly

Next to your flame
A rush of panic and

The lock has been raped
This is only a game
This is only a game
But then our star rushes in
Feeling like a child and looking

Like a woman
She has been forecast with an
Attempt to kill herself

But the ending didn't test well
EAT ME, DRINK ME
This is only a game

This is only a game
EAT ME, DRINK ME

This is only a game
This is only a game
So now picking my skin
And my scales
I see my horror
Mirrored in the Sundown of your blank stare
I see my horror
Mirrored in the Sundown of your blank stare
EAT ME, DRINK ME
This is only a game
This is only a game
But then our star rushes in
Feeling like a child and looking
Like a woman
She has been forecast with an
Attempt to kill herself
But the ending didn't test well
She has been forecast with an
Attempt to kill herself
But the ending didn't test well
She has been forecast with an
Attempt to kill herself
But the ending didn't test well
She has been forecast with an
Attempt to kill herself
But the ending didn't test well
