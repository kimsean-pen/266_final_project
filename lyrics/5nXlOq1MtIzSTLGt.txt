Hot steamy night alone
I wait for you.
Cold brittle morning alone
And I cry for you.
And when you finally call,
You cloak your moves in the shadows.

Those days and nights I was good to you.
They must not have meant very much to you.
The night I needed you the most,
My cries fell on deaf ears.

And I'm running so hard to find it
And I'm running so fast.
And I'm telling you now to leave me,
Our romance cannot last.
And if someday I need to see you,
I'll come back from the past.
I'll come back and find you,
I'll never leave you now.

Those days and nights I was good to you.
They must not have meant very much to you.
The night I needed you the most,
My cries fell on deaf ears.

Now I don't want to play games with you.
But I don't know what to say to you.
The digits change so slowly now.
I'm going it alone.

And I'm running so hard to find it
And I'm running so fast.
And I'm telling you now to leave me,
Our romance cannot last.
And if someday I need to see you,
I'll come back from the past.
I'll come back and find you,
I'll never leave you now.
