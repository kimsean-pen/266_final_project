I want to go places that I've never been
Rome, California, Paris, Berlin
I want to see things that I've never seen
Quietly happy and live by the sea

They say, don't go out
Don't get lost in the dark
Don't go in too deep
Don't swim out too far
They say, don't grow up
Don't grow up too fast
'Cause I feel it all and I need to live a little at last

Mm-mm-mm-mmm
Mm-mm-mm-mmm

I wanna stay out all night, say hello to the dawn
Creep back to bed, they'll never know I was gone
Write songs through the day, be alone with my thoughts
Spend time with the ones that I've always adored

They say, don't go out
Don't get lost in the dark
Don't go in too deep
Don't swim out too far
They say, don't grow up
Don't grow up too fast
'Cause I feel it all and I need to live a little at last

Make my own mistakes
Follow a somberly heart
I am not afraid
I will let down my guard

They say, don't go out
Don't get lost in the dark
Don't go in too deep
Don't swim out too far
They say, don't grow up
Don't grow up too fast
'Cause I feel it all and I need to live a little at last

Mm-mm-mm-mmm
Mm-mm-mm-mmm
Mm-mm-mm-mmm
Mm-mm-mm-mmm
