I caught a chill
And it's still frozen on my skin
I think about why I'm alone
By myself no one else to explain
How far do I go
No one knows
If the end is so much better
Why don't we just live forever

Don't tell me I'm the last one in line
Don't tell me I'm too late this time

I don't wanna live
To waste another day
Underneath the shadow
Of mistakes I've made
'Cause I feel like I'm breaking inside
I don't wanna fall
And say I lost it all
'Cause maybe there's a part of me
That hit the wall
Leaving pieces of me behind
And I feel like I'm breaking inside

Out here, nothings clear
Except the moment I decided
To move on and I ignited
Disappear, into the fear
You know there ain't no coming back
When you're still carrying the past
You can't erase, separate
Cigarette in my hand
Hope you all understand

I won't be the last one in line
I finally figured out whats mine

I don't wanna live
To waste another day
Underneath the shadow
Of mistakes I've made
'Cause I feel like I'm breaking inside
I don't wanna fall
And say I lost it all
'Cause maybe there's a part of me
That hit the wall
Leaving pieces of me behind
Leaving pieces of me behind
And I feel like I'm breaking inside

I won't be the last one in line
I finally figured out what's mine

I don't wanna live
To waste another day
Underneath the shadow
Of mistakes I've made
'Cause I feel like I'm breaking inside
I don't wanna fall
And say I lost it all
'Cause maybe there's a part of me
That hit the wall
Leaving pieces of me behind
Leaving pieces of me behind
And I feel like I'm breaking inside
And I feel like I'm breaking
And I feel like I'm breaking inside
