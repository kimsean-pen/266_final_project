'Cause I know, I know
I know, I know, I know

Sweetness drips from your lips in a kiss
It tastes like money
Hold me, you need me by your side
I only want your honey

Need your love for a price
Will you be so careless tonight?
'Cause I know, I know
I know, I know what's on your mind

Sweetness drips from your lips in a kiss
It tastes like money
Hold me by the hand, not the hips
It tastes like money
Sweetness drips from your lips in a kiss
It tastes like money
Hold me by the hand, not the hips
'Cause I'm not your honey

The all-seeing-eye
The Queen's been alive for such a long time
I'll pay you in lies
I know what's on your mind

Need your love for a price
Will we be together tonight?
'Cause I know, I know
I know, I know what's on your mind

Sweetness drips from your lips in a kiss
(It tastes like money)
It tastes like money
Hold me by the hand, not the hips
(It tastes like money)
It tastes like money
Sweetness drips from your lips in a kiss
(It tastes like money)
It tastes like money
Hold me by the hand, not the hips
'Cause I'm not your honey

Ooh-whoah
Ooh-whoah
Ooh-whoah
Sweetness drips from your lips in a kiss
It tastes like money
Hold me by the hand, not the hips
It tastes like money
