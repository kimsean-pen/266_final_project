Sappy pathetic, little me
That was the girl I used to be
You had me on my knees

I'd trade you places any day
I'd never thought you could be that way
But you looked like me on Sunday

Oh, you came in with the breeze
On Sunday morning
You sure have changed since yesterday
Without any warning

I thought I knew you
I thought I knew you
I thought I knew you well

So well
You're trying my shoes on for a change
They look so good
But fit so strange

Out of fashion
So I can complain
Oh, you came in with the breeze on Sunday morning
You sure have changed since yesterday without any warning

I thought I knew you
I thought I knew you
I thought I knew you well
So well

I know who I am, but who are you?
You're not looking like you used to
You're on the other side of the mirror
So nothing's looking quite as clear
Thank you
For turning on the light
Thank you
Now you're the parasite
I didn't think you had it in you
And now you're looking like I used to
You came in with the breeze
On Sunday morning
You sure have changed since yesterday
Without any warning
And you want me badly
Because you cannot have me
I thought I knew you
I've got a new view
I thought I knew you well
Oh well
On Sunday morning
Without a warning
Sunday morning
I thought I knew you
Sunday morning
Oh you want me badly
You cannot have me
Sunday morning
Sunday morning
Sunday morning
