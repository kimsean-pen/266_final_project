I don't know what I ever wanted
you got a front, well you better flaunt it
ate a piece of the devil's body
the face of the devil follows me
every day it feels like I'm running
and I'm headed straight for the blaze
and I can breathe when I'm underwater
and I'm ready with a finger on the trigger
ooh, who's that girl
who's that girl
she's only special in secret
and she's got her own familiar spirits
something inside of her rises and she knows
who's that girl
who's that girl
(use that gun)
who's that girl
who's that girl
I don't know what I ever wanted
you got a front well you better flaunt it
ate a piece of the devil's body
yea the face of the devil follows me
