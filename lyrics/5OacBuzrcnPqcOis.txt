Follow my heart, follow my feet
All the advice that I take
Fall into line, fall into place
All of these rules that you make
I know you want me to be something more
But I know what I'm doing is right for me

I don't need a silver lining,
I don't need your hold
I can't seem to see you smiling,
But it's okay, okay
I, I didn't need it anyway!

I didn't need it anyway!
I didn't need it anyway!

Follow my heart, all of my dreams
Give me a reason to change it
Pull them apart, split them to seas
I won't forget where I came from
Why won't you let me to be who I am?
When I know what I'm doing is right for me?

I don't need a silver lining,
I don't need your hold
I can't seem to see you smiling,
But it's okay, okay
I, I didn't need it anyway!

I didn't need it anyway!
I didn't need it anyway!

We could talk about the future,
We could talk about it all
You could talk about my dreams
Oh, why? Why is all that you have to say so flaw?

I don't need a silver lining,
I don't need your hold
I can't seem to see you smiling,
But it's okay, okay
I, I didn't need it anyway!

I didn't need it anyway!
I didn't need it anyway!

I didn't need it anyway!
I didn't need it anyway!
