Bridge of the blind
Take me somewhere
Away to an unknown land
And from where I was before
What would I find
If I open my eyes?
One foot, then another
Straight into the bottom lands

Here I stand
On the Bridge of the blind
Can't see where I'm going
Or what I leave behind

Almost goodbye
On the Bridge of the blind
No sign of summer
On the other side

Here I stand
On the Bridge of the blind
Can't see where I'm going
Or what I leave behind

Almost goodbye
On the Bridge of the blind
No sign of summer
On the other side

What would I find
If open my eyes?
Will you be waiting
On the other side?
