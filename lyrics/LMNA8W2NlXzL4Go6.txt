I've got a way of finding out what you said
But I want to hear it from the butcher's mouth
I've got a way of freaking out all your friends when I'm just talking out loud
But it ends me when I can tell that I've become the person I can't take, that I hate
A person so much like you

I've got a way
Your jealous eyes, with reckless pride, feasting on the wealth
I've got a way
This little click, brick by brick, has turned upon itself

You're a broken record repeating these vanities
Over and over again

You find your words and made them work for you
And trust me, people will drink them in
The absence of a witness, no one to see this
Hid your affection for self-obsession and the greed
But now it's back to your, back to your needs

I've got a way
Your jealous eyes, with reckless pride, feasting on the wealth
I've got a way
This little click, brick by brick, has turned upon itself

You're a broken record repeating these vanities
Over and over
The same old story

Throw yourself a pity party
Pulling each and every heartstring
We brought you here
We brought you here
And no one will come to your defense

Let's break that smile right off your face
Taking time to save the place
Where names are of no use
Ridiculous answers will find their sleep
And you will find your sleep too

Way
I've got a way

You're a broken record repeating these vanities
Over and over again
