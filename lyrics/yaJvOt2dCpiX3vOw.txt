Don't just the perfect life
You can't see what lies behind
The time spent to forge that strength

Beauty exists only through struggle
But mine was not
Plain to the eye
Until I painted
The perfect picture

Pull myself away from heaven
Paint everything black
Grow my horns
Make myself ugly

Paint my skin with maps
Back to the old ways
Disappear forever
