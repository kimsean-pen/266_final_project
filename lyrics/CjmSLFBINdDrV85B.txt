I don't think that I can know
All the things hiding in your soul
But I'm gonna try to hold
I'll keep on trying now till it's gone

But I feel it in myself, myself
Yeah I feel it in my blood, I'm feeling it
Now it's you and me again, I'm giving my heart
My heart to you and all I need is la verdad

La verdad
La verdad
La verdad
La verdad

Let your love speak to me
I see you zooming throught my dreams
I never knew it is love I need
But without you I fall apart

But I feel it in myself, myself
Yeah I'm feeling it in my blood, I'm feeling it
Now it's you and me again, I'm giving my heart
My heart to you and all I need back is the truth

La verdad
La verdad
La verdad
La verdad
