All I centered on you
Heartbreak's paintin' me blue
I shattered what I felt, took the pieces far away
Hiding all my feelings that I feel another day

Each time I feel like falling out
I remember what still hurts the most
I tried to drain an ocean
But I know I'll never rid this ghost

Slow down, I am on fire
Chasing each, enough to the dead
Threw my heart against the wall, cuz I want to watch it break
Bleeds on every single moment, every second that I waste

Each time I feel like falling out
I remember what still hurts the most

I tried to drain an ocean
But I know I'll never rid this ghost

Each time I feel like falling out
I remember what still hurts the most

I tried to drain an ocean
But I know I'll never rid this ghost
