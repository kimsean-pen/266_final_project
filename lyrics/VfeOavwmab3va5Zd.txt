Here we go again
It seems as though I've found myself another ledge
To step off and fill my head with regret
With regret
Here we go again
I dress up my problems and shelve them
It never ends
Oh it never ends
And someone said
That I'll be better off in the end
I just can't see that yet
I just can't see that yet
That yet

I can't stand losing you
After all that we've been through
Sometimes there's no coming back
And I'm folding into you
When I've got no right to
I just wanna make it right
I've run out of time
I've run out of time

Here we go again
This time I made things a little more permanent
Wrestled with the voices inside my head
No longer heaven sent
I know, I know, I know I'm not the only one
I know, I know, I know you want someone you can trust
Someone you can love
Someone you can touch
Feel the warmth from
When the lights are off

I can't stand losing you
After all that we've been through
Sometimes there's no coming back
And I'm folding into you
When I've got no right to
I just wanna make it right, hey
And I can't stand losing you
After all that we've been through
I just wanna make it right
I've run out of time
I've run out of time

I just can't stand
Losing you
After all that we've been through
After all that we've been through
I just can't stand
Losing you
After all that we've been through
After all that we've been through
