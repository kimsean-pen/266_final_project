For you my heart is open
and my eyes are swollen
And it's way too hard to see

And my head is in clouds
but your voice is too loud
Only cigarettes to breathe

The sun will follow out a way
Can you feel it?
All the shadows disappear
Gone forever

We don't belong to anyone
All we always come undone - Uh

It's a great day to say goodbye
It's ok 'cause I'll be alright

I'm in someone else's place
It doesnt matter
Take the memories away
And I'll be better

Shoot a rocket to the sky
Think of us and let it fly

It's a great day to say goodbye
It's ok 'cause I'll be alright

Uh Oh
Uh Oh
Come and let go
Don't remember
All the days that
were meant to last forever

Come and let go
Don't remember
All that comes now
Ahead of us forever

The sun will follow out a way
Can you feel it?

It's a great day to say goodbye
It can never get better than tonight

It's a great day to say goodbye
It's ok 'cause I'll be alright

Alright
