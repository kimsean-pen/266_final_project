Got lost in the battle
Shared the warfield with an instigator
Was it a bad dream hiding behind the truth
I can't share this with you

Are you really as approachable as you let us imagine
Can you show me where we stand
There must be an easy way to get this thing done right
Capsizing walls around us
Modernized youth
Reborn every morning
And dying with the sun

One dose of your humanity is enough for me
The world grabbed me in a chokehold
One dose of your humanity is enough for me
The world grabbed me in a chokehold

As you rise from beyond
And the earth crumbles
Fury is the reason, pain is the key
And once again you opened your soul and bled on me
Couldn't find the reason to why I'm not able to see

One dose of your humanity was enough for me
The world grabbed me in a chokehold
Who should I thank for?
One dose of your humanity was enough for me
The world grabbed me in a chokehold
