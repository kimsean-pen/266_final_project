Tip-toe by the window
By the window, that is where I'll be
Come tip-toe through the tulips with me
Ooohh
Tip-toe by the garden
By the garden of a willow tree
Come tip-toe through the tulips with me
Knee deep in flowers we'll stray
We'll keep the showers away
And if I kiss you in the garden
In the moonlight, will you pardon me?
And tip-toe through the tulips with me
(sounds)
Knee deep in flowers we'll stray
We'll keep the showers away
And if I kiss you in the garden
In the moonlight, will you pardon me?
And tip-toe through the tulips with me
