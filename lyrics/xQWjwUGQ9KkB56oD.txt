We're faithful
Broken promise of the lies
The virtues beaten down
Into your empty eyes
A saint is not a weapon
It's a message, a message
A sermon of shame
A demon that you want to blame
Sell you,
Change you
Leave you in a world of flames
Pain is not a blessing
It's a lesson

Don't bow down to a world of hate
From your cradle
To the grave

Even if you sacrifice beliefs to get through
And even if you take the side
Of lies over truth
Everyday (everyday) the world will take
What you give in to
So hold on to every breath of life...
In a world of sacrifice

A personal slave
The one you left to die in vain
Sold you
Changed you
Taught you all their selfish ways.
Faith becomes an addiction
Not ambition

Don't bow down to a world of hate
From your cradle
To the grave

even if you sacrifice beliefs to get through
And even if you take the side
Of lies over truth
Everyday (everyday) the world will take
What you give in to
So hold on to every breath of life...
In a world of sacrifice

Hold on, in a world of sacrifice
Hold on, until your last breath is gone
Hold on, in a world of sacrifice
Hold on, until your last breath is gone
