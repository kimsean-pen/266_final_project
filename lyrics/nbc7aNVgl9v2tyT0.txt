Sensuality
Its the only thing we have (babe)
I've been feelin' weak
Ever since you left

Let me take this chance to say that i will never let you down
And people look at me sometimes and see a man who's lost his love
And that doesn't necessarily mean that i purposely try to be free
Because honestly i couldn't live without you here in my life (baby)

You can't handle me
So pretend you can (babe)
I've been feelin' weak
Ever since you left

Sensuality
Its the only thing we have (babe)
I've been feelin' weak
Ever since you left

(Sensuality)
