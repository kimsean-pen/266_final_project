What's on your mind?
Blackout girls
Period

I won't lie
I won't hit you
I won't ask what's on yo mind
I won't kiss you, I won't pick up every time
I won't miss you, I won't wanna make you mine
I get drunk, I get twisted
I get by
I got demons, I got reasons why I lie
I be tweakin', I be screamin' every night
You my baby, You my nigga
You my life
You my passion, You my poison
You my high

Rollin' the dice all the time
I almost stopped all the time
Showin' the ice all the time
Question my life all the time
Took by the pint, regular
Took with the knife, jugular
You wanna fight, right?
You want this life, right?
I do what I like, bitch
Made you excited
Still too defiant, and
Still get too violent
Bitches too violent
And let that remind ya
So what is the night ya?
You ain't safe, aye

I won't lie
I won't hit you
I won't ask what's on yo mind
I won't kiss you, I won't pick up every time
I won't miss you, I won't wanna make you mine
I get drunk, I get twisted
I get by
I got demons, I got reasons why I lie
I be tweakin', I be screamin' every night
You my baby, You my nigga
You my life
You my passion, You my poison
You my high

Rollin' the dice all the time
I almost stopped all the time
Showin' the ice all the time
Question my life all the time
Took by the pint, regular
Took with the knife, jugular
You wanna fight, right?
You want this life, right?
I do what I like, bitch
Made you excited
Still too defiant, and
Still get too violent
Bitches too violent
And let that remind ya
So what is the night ya?
You ain't safe, aye

I won't lie
I won't hit you
I won't ask what's on yo mind
I won't kiss you, I won't pick up every time
I won't miss you, I won't wanna make you mine
I get drunk, I get twisted
I get by
I got demons, I got reasons why I lie
I be tweakin', I be screamin' every night
You my baby, You my nigga
You my life
You my passion, You my poison
You my high
