Let me sit this ass
On you
Show you how, I feel
Let me take this off
While you watch me? (watch me)
Yes, mass appeal
Don't take your eyes
Don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like
You can touch it, baby
(Do you?) You know you wanna touch it, baby... (touch it)
(Baby) Ooh... Grab ahold
Don't let go
Let me know
That you ready (re-e-eady)
I just wanna show you now
Slow it down
Go around...
(You rock hard, I rock steady)

And rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me

Rocket 'til waterfalls...
Rocket 'til waterfalls...
Rocket 'til water falls...
Bathe in these waterfalls

I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession:
I'm proud of all this bass
Baby, I'll put it in your face... By
The way, if you need a personal trainer
Or a therapist
I can be your piece of sunshine
Inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines, you and I create...
Rocket 'til waterfalls...

So rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me

Hard... rock... steady... rock... hard... rock... steady... rock...
Hard... rock... steady... rock... hard... rock... steady...

Don't you know that I
Give you your loving if you need it?
I give you my word
You can believe it...
Your love feels like all four seasons
Growing inside me
Life has a reason...
Swimming in my love
Your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screaming to the lord, boy...
Kiss me
Pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it
(Pulse) Deep in the peak of my waterfall...
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, 'til the water falls... ('til the water falls...)

Damn...

I can't help but love the way we make love...

Daddy... Daddy...
Ooh, child, Ooh, now
Yes, Lord, damn, baby...
You're driving me cray-cray...

You ain't right for doing it to me like that, Daddy,
Even though
I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl...
Tell me, what you're gon' do about that?
(Punish me, please... Punish me)
(Please) Daddy, what you gon' with all of this ass
All up in your face? Yeah, hell yeah... (Love me so deep...)
Ooh, my shit's so good, it ain't even right...
I know I'm right
Hell yeah, you the shit - that's why you're my equivalent...
So sexy...

We're so much more than pointless fixtures
Instagram pictures
Consumers...
(What about that ching-ching-ching? What about that, what about that)
(Ching-ching?) Baby boomers... (Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby...)
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in...
Home is where the heart is
Goddammit, I'm
Comfortable in my skin,
And you're comfortable in my skin...
You look so comfortable in my skin, skin, (yeah) skin...
(Yeah) Rocket 'til waterfalls...
