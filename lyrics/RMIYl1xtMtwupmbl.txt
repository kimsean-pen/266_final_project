One day I'll stop breathing
My heart will stop beating
I won't see your face again
This flesh and blood is weak
And life isn't ours to keep
Sometime it has to end
In time even memories fade away
With time you might live
To forgive and forget
The mistakes that I made

I broke some promises
Sometimes I lied to you
But one thing will always be true
I'll never stop lovin' you

Falling from your grace
You'll never be replaced
God knows how hard I've tried
But it just ain't no use
Well, I thought I could shake you loose
I'm still torn up inside
In time even memories fade away
With time you might live
To forgive and forget
The mistakes that I made

I broke some promises
Sometimes I lied to you
But one thing will always be true
I'll never stop lovin' you

I broke some promises
Sometimes I lied to you
But one thing will always be true
I'll never stop lovin' you

No,no,no,no never stop lovin' you
Lovin' you
