I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
Treat me like the worst thing you ever seen
Treat me like the worst thing you ever seen

I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so cruel
I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so cruel
Treat me like a lowdown stupid fool
Treat me like a lowdown stupid fool

Was letting go
I sing this song
And now it's over
Call off the line

I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
Treat me like the worst thing you ever seen
Treat me like the worst thing you ever seen

I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so bad
I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so bad
Treat me like the worst thing you ever had
Treat me like the worst thing you ever had

I'm so alone
Like when I die
Just so sad
I cry, I cry

I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
Treat me like the worst thing you ever seen
Treat me like the worst thing you ever seen

Oh sweetness
My love and more
Please don't go
Oh please don't go

I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
Treat me like the worst thing you ever seen
Treat me like the worst thing you ever seen

I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
Treat me like the worst thing you ever seen
Treat me like the worst thing you ever seen

I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
I know you don't love me but you don't have to be so mean
