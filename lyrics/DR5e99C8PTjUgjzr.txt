You know I love you
But you don't know how much
You know I need you
I need your touch
You know I love you
But you don't know how much
No you don't
No you don't
No you don't

But we can find a better way
Have to find a better way
We can find a better way
To prove it, prove it, prove it
It's a beautiful life
If you give it chance it can make you dance
It's a beautiful life
Alright, alright

Do you feel it
With your feet on the ground
Do you hear it
It makes no sound
Do you feel it
The world is turning
No you don't, no you don't
No you don't

We can find a better way (better way)
Have to find a better way (better way)
We can find a better way (better way)
To prove it, prove it, prove it

It's a beautiful life
If you give it chance it can make you dance
It's a beautiful life
Alright, alright

You know I love you
But you don't know how much
You know I need you
I need your touch

We can find a better way (better way)
Have to find a better way (better way)
We can find a better way (better way)
To prove it, prove it, prove it

It's a beautiful life
If you give it chance it can make you dance
It's a beautiful life
Alright, alright
It's a beautiful life
Alright, alright
