I love him; he's an artist, but he cannot find himself
With puzzled looks, he ponders books upon some ancient shelf
He does the best he can; that's why i love that man
But i also love the woman in his soul

I love him ‘cause he questions all the roles he's forced to play
‘Grown men don't cry': he sees the lie, and cannot change his way
Oh, but he does the best he can; that's why i love that man
But i also love the woman in his soul

Joseph, oh Joseph, i love you when you're hard
But you know i love you when you're soft
So why do you discard the one inside of you?
His heart is torn in two, and he knows he's incomplete
And he won't be whole until he also loves the woman in his soul

Woman soul
