There was a time, dark and divine,
Exciting and new, shameful untrue
Free to explore we had it all.
Towering trust, insatiable lust

Clouding the truth both of us knew
This sordid affair is ending in tears
Yes we must go on knowing the wrong
Hunting the day it was taken away

Oh, all our love fell down to Earth.
Here, broken and cold, with great remorse

Before a while it all made sense
It might have been just a dark pretence
But you had me
And I left it

To be with you, to be the one,
To live a lie
It really got me all excited.
I felt wanted

Then in the dark a sorrowing sigh
Was taken away. Deliverance came
Fell from the sky. Heaven replied
Salvation in strings, silent and clean.

All that we were, all that we knew
Faded away with tears in the rain.
Yes all that we were, all that we knew
Is fading away like tears in the rain.

All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away
All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away
All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away
All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away
