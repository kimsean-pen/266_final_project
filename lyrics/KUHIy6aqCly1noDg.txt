Best of cruel intentions
Binding what they fail to mention
No truth
All pretension
Raise your hand to give attention

You'd give it
We'd take it
You'd build it
We'd break it
You sign and we erase it
You'd feel it
We'd fake it
It's my red star (steal it)

It's my red star (can't let go)
It's my red star (conceal it)
It's my red star
Oh no...

Wasted education
Celebrating imitation

Misplaced admiration
Speaking for a generation

You'd give it
We'd take it
You'd build it
We'd break it
You sign and we erase it

You'd feel it
We fake it
It's my red star (steal it)

It's my red star (can't let go)
It's my red star (conceal it)

It's my red star
Oh no...
