I want you, to show me the way to your heart
I need to, so show me the way to your heart
What you say is what you know, you're fighting against your heart of gold
Look inside yourself, live your life with love

Everybody loves the sunrise
Everybody loves the sunrise
Everybody loves the sunrise
Everybody loves the sunrise

I told you, I'd find my way to your heart
I need you, and I wanted you from the start, girl
What you say is what you know, you're fighting against your heart of gold
Look inside yourself, live your life with love

Everybody loves the sunrise
Everybody loves the sunrise
Everybody loves the sunrise
Everybody loves the sunrise
