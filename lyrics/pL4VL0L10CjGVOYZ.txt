Well, if you think about it then you're a fool, yeah
It's just a size and the mind that won't give you up
And if I think about it, well, am I cool yet?
'Cause it's the word of the knife that won't cut you up

And if we think about it, well, is it true yet?
'Cause there'S no line that reminds whether we are enough
So let's think about it, oh, are we through yet
It's just the crime at the time of a masculine hug

'Cause we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time
Forced to love

When we speak about it
Made the right always on mine
And if I speak about it
Erase the lies, love is frozen

So if you think about it, what would you do?
You're just the man with the plan saying we are not lost
So let's think about it, oh, are we through yet?
It's just the time to decide if we can move up, up, up, up

'Cause we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time

Forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time
Forced to love

Well, if you think about it then you're a fool, yeah
'Cause you decide to believe in what we made up
And if I think about it, am I cool yet?
'Cause there's no lie like that lie that made us give up
