Throughout all time
Within the past, present and future
Man has sought to destroy
All that stood in our way

As man fights man
In the epic struggle for survival
The warmaster shall reign
With oppression fed by a burning hate

Hatred of mankind, twisted within your mind
Corrupted by powers unknown, the downfall of this world

The end of your life, beginning of human strife
Destruction of this cripples planet
Warmaster an inhuman prophet

Warmaster

You shall obey all that he commands

Hatred of mankind, twisted within your mind
Corrupted by powers unknown, the downfall of this world

Now once more... we rise to fall
Man's destruction... in the final war
Nothing's left... of the human race
The planet's end... our destiny oblivion
