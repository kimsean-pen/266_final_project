Oh la la la
I love the way you smile
Oh la la la
I wanna talk to you for a while
Oh la la la
I love the way you smile
Oh la la la
I need you in my room tonight

Let's go for a walk
Down by the river side
Let's go for ride
Ill take you to the mountain side
Baby give your hand
I will take the lead talk
We can talk bout the birds and the trees
I'd like to give you a squeeze

Oh la la la
I love the way you smile
Oh la la la
I wanna talk to you for a while
Oh la la la
I love the way you smile
Oh la la la
I need you in my room tonight

What's your future plan
Tell me do you have a man
Cause I am in the mood
I don't mean to be rude
I know you kinda shy
But let's give it a try
My love will take you high
And make your fire light
