Not mine, you just wanna waste my time
Can't let you get away on my dime
I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm fine
I'm fine, you know I'll be just alright
I'm cool, I'm just out here living my life

I'm too gone to fall for you
Came too far to follow you
You see that I can't be used
Won't work now, so what's the use?
Can't keep getting caught up in your issues
Can't keep calling me with all your bad news
Got my own problems trying to work through
And I know what I'm worth so I don't need you

Not mine, you just wanna waste my time
Can't let you get away on my dime
I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm fine
I'm fine, you know I'll be just alright
I'm cool, I'm just out here living my life

Why you wanna waste my time
I been on the grind, yeah
Should've saw the signs
Guess they tell me love is blind
You should choose
'Cause I'm really not the one you wanna lose
So gassed up I'm in the club with my pack
Always had my back when I don't know where you at
Where you at?
I can't be your side like that
We ain't going out like that

Not mine, you just wanna waste my time
Can't let you get away on my dime
I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm fine
I'm fine, you know I'll be just alright
I'm cool, I'm just out here living my life
