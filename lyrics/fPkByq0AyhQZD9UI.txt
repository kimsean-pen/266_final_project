Such a remarkable day
All for me, thanks to you

Our deepest sympathy to the family
All our compassion may know misery
Hope she was carried in ecstasy
Calmly defiant, may she rest in peace

Such a remarkable day
How did you choose this Wednesday?
The bird by your side, he flew

Such a remarkable day
How did you choose this Wednesday?
The bird by your side always knew
