all that you do
all that you say
to get to home is,
to get away
you can stay home
or go away
to get to home is,
to get away.

i hear it.

ohh ohh ohh

i hear it.

always a rich.
never the cold.
dont take the pain now
hold out for more.
and when you wake up
your dying days
to get to home still,
to get away.

i hear it.

ohh ohh ohh

i hear it.
