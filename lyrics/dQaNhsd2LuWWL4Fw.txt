I can drive all night
I can drive to find you
It won't save our souls
But late at night, I find a little peace
Out on the highway
Looking high and low
Across the county
Down to where the city shines out gold
And it keeps you there

I can drive all night
I can drive right to you
If you call my name
I can be there, right by your side

I know that highway
Better than myself
It's what defines me
Cutting through the dark
The dark dark night
The dark dark night
The dark dark night
The dark dark night
