Tell me that you need me
To help you find a way
Through all of this madness
Can I be your light of day?

Please, won't you believe me?
Even if you don't agree
Know that I am trying
To help us all break free

Oh, there'll be nothing left for no one, no
There'll be nothing left for no one
If you don't stop living your life
Turned to one side with a blind eye
There'll be nothing left for no one
For no one

I'm saying that I'm sorry, yeah
For things I've said and done
But I don't want to be here
If I'm, I'm looking down a gun

Oh, there'll be nothing left for no one, no
There'll be nothing left for no one
If you don't stop living your life
Turned to one side with a blind eye
There'll be nothing left for no one
For no one

Left for no one, left for no one, left for no one
Left for no one, left for no one
Left for no one, left for no one, left for no one
There'll be nothing left for no one
For no one
