You wait all my day, you wait on
You waited all my days
It's no way we marry,
It's just. as gorgeous as day are
I know you'll never run away!
Your ...man was a wild child
.has his keys in his dirty mind
Saxophone sings from inside his head cause:
Chorus:
I know you'll never run away!
I know you'll never run away!
I know you'll never run away!
I know you'll never run away!
I'm waving all the town... cause your man
You tell my dawn days are away
You stay on, carry on, like the leavers and lovers
Don't tell the others to run away!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man
Hey, hey, hey cause...
Chorus:
I know you'll never run away!
I know you'll never run away!
I know you'll never run away!
I know you'll never run away!
Holding you all night through till the dawn
You tell my dawn days away
My steady style on how to love
Then taking... after count down sometimes
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man
Hey, hey, hey close to touching
Chorus:
I know you'll never run away!
I know you'll never run away!
I know you'll never run away!
I know you'll never run away!
