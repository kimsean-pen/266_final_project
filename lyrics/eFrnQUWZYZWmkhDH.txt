It's easy to fall in love
When you fall in love you know you're done
You got easy eyes to hunt
When the world above needs your blood

And the cold vain to the richest man
They're paid away to steal our hand

There ain't no easy way, no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way, no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way, no there ain't no easy way out

It's easy to fall in love
When you're on your luck you know you're done
And the last kiss had a foolish cause
Now your tired eyes can only haunt

There ain't no easy way, no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way, no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way, no there ain't no easy way out

There ain't no easy way, no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way, no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way, no there ain't no easy way out

There ain't no easy way, no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way, no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way, no there ain't no easy way out

It's easy to fall in love
When you fall in love you know you're done
It's easy to fall in love
When you fall in love you know you're done
