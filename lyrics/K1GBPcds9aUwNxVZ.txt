Your flights delayed
Go learn Italian
Find a girl with a gold medallion
The birds will poo right on your head
It's just their way of showing you affection
Lost your keys, befriend a neighbour
Maybe she's got a story to savour

I'll tell you Fenn
I'll tell you when
It's now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now

I'll tell you Fenn
I'll tell you when
It's now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now

It rained it rained, so I dived right in
Swam through the city, soaked to the skin
You're stuck in traffic, the mind has an attic
Pull out a thought, send it to Patrick
Broke my phone, so i went to he zoo
Did you know you can talk to the animals, too?

I'll tell you Fenn
I'll tell you when
It's now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now

I'll tell you Fenn
I'll tell you when
It's now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now

Remember how you always did smile
Oblivious to every minor disaster
There were only small moments in between all the waves of the laughter
Lost my job so I left the island
Now i work with my best friend Simon
Lost a tenner on the platform
But maybe a cold heart is now warm

I'll tell you Fenn
I'll tell you when
It's now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now

I'll tell you Fenn
I'll tell you when
It's now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now

I'll tell you Fenn
I'll tell you when
It's now
