Wake up.
I've been trying to make your pain stop,
This is not just entertainment
I've been trying to let you know
Lately nothing has been coming easy
only nocturnal through movies
and komodo on the floor

Even when you won't believe me,
try to make it easy, easy
Even when were fire,
Even then you never loved
you never loved
Even when were fire,
Even then you never loved
You never loved

Distress
From the pass off from my weakness,
I can take you through the darkness
I can help you let it go
Damaged
Why the fuck did you just say that?
I'm a person not a concept,
Work it out or let me know

Even when you don't believe me,
try to make it easy, easy
even when were fire
Even then you never loved
you never loved
You never loved
Even when were fire,
even then you never loved
you never loved

You never loved
you never loved
you never loved
even when were fire
Even then you never loved
you never loved
even when were fire
Even then you never loved
you never loved
even when were fire
Even then you never loved
you never loved
even when were fire
Even then you never loved
you never loved
