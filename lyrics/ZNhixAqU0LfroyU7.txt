You and I, are restless souls
We're far too young, to feel this old
We spend the night, every night
Are we alive, or are we cold

Come for the bleeding love, oh it's not enough
Come wanna light it up, set this bed on fire
Come for the bleeding love, oh it's not enough
Come wanna light it up, bed on fire cause

We are young to feel this old and
We are too young to feel this old
Shame on us for letting magic go
'Cause we're too young, too young to feel this old

I can't believe, our chemistry
Has turned to steel and left us numb
Can we resurrect, this disconnect
And go back where, it all begun

Come for the bleeding love, oh it's not enough
Come wanna light it up, set this bed on fire
Come for the bleeding love, oh it's not enough
Come wanna light it up, bed on fire cause

We are young to feel this old and
We are too young to feel this old
Shame on us for letting magic go
'Cause we're too young, too young to feel this old

Let's bring it back, bring it back in time
Let's bring it back, back, back when you were mine
Let's bring it back, bring it back in time
We're too young, too young to feel this old

We're too young to feel this old
We're too young to feel this

We are young to feel this old and
We are too young to feel this old
Shame on us for letting magic go
'Cause we're too young, too young to feel this old

We are high to feel this low yeah
We are too fast to be this slow
No more words, just bring your body close
'Cause we're too young, too young to feel this old

We're too young, too young to feel this old
We're too young, too young, too young
We're too young, too young to feel this old
