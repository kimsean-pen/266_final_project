Whoa!
Hey! Hey!

That's what I like about you
You hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
Wanna come over tonight?
Yeah!

Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true, that's what I like about you

What I like about you
You really know how to dance
When you go up, down, jump around
Think about true romance, yeah!

Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true, that's what I like about you

That's what I like about you

Hey!

What I like about you
You keep me warm at night

Never wanna let you go
Know you make me feel alright

(One two three four!)

Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true, that's what I like about you

That's what I like about you
(What I like about you)
That's what I like about you
