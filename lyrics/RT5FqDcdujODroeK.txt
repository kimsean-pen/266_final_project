There's a fire, there's a fire, there's a fire and I'm wild
And it yearns and it rolls like a tide, sweet undertow
And we burn, and we burn, and we burn to the ground
Every bridge, every road, that we'd found
We've no way home

I feel the pressure coming down on me
The only question:
Can there be harmony without a lesson?
Without losing control?

Don't let go, it's time for us to finally see
We can't stop 'til our minds are free
There, we're hangin' by a thread of hope
Dont let go, my sisters and my brothers weep
Don't have to read the signs to see
That blood on the leaves that you sat on
Don't let go

There's a cage, there's a cage, there's a cage with no key
Like a stranger who's locked in a dream with no way out, hm
So we wait, and we wait, and we wait for so long
We forget that we severed a song
We used to sing

I feel the pressure coming down on me
The only question:
Can there be harmony without a lesson?
Without losing control?

Don't let go, it's time for us to finally see
We can't stop 'til our minds are free
There, we're hangin' by a thread of hope
Dont let go, my sisters and my brothers weep
Don't have to read the signs to see
That blood on the leaves that you sat on
Don't let go
Don't let go, it's time for us to finally see
We can't stop 'til our minds are free
There, we're hangin' by a thread of hope
Dont let go, my sisters and my brothers weep
Don't have to read the signs to see
That blood on the leaves that you sat on
Don't let go
