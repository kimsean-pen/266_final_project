Fly straight with perfection
Find me a new direction
We never realised the things they said
We never realise until we're dead
The fires they burned
Along the coast of triumphs
The ebony embittered souls of children
We'll seek another way before too long
But will you stop my wind
Before I'm gone
And when you find me
And when you find me all alone
Your world has never been my own
And when you find me
And when you find me all alone
Your world has never been my own
My friend you're black
And when you fly you're wild
I am white, sometimes I behave
Just like a child
The Northern seas are cold
But they're our own
We'll sail your Southern seas
Before too long
When I was a Viking
My friend he was the Raven
