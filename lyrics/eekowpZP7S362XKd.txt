Get off of work and we meet down at our spot
We had a patio with a view of a parkin' lot
It was two for one and four for two
And Christmas lights in the middle of June
All hung up like I was on you

I say hey hey baby do you want to come over
You say no way then you move in closer
Next thing I know you were in my T-shirt
Right there your hair messed up like a Guns 'N Roses video
Oh-oh so hot you still got it up in my head
You're movin' around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like your dress my floor
No way you wore my my T-shirt, Yeah
You look good in my T-shirt uh, oh yeah

We be walkin' up the stairs
With the neighbors sayin' keep it down
But its hard to unblock the door when you're makin' out
You know what I'm sayin'
You be sayin' that we gotta quit doin' this
So why you leanin' in for one more kiss
And pretty soon you're slidin' off what you've got on
And slippin' into my T-shirt

Right there your hair messed up like a Guns 'N Roses video
Oh-oh so hot you still got it up in my head
You're movin' around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like your dress my floor
No way you wore my my T-shirt
Yeah my T-shirt

Oh no baby no I can't lie
You sure look good in my T-shirt
Oh no baby no I can't lie
You look good on my mind

I say hey hey baby do you want to come over
You say no way then you move in closer
The next thing I know you are in my T-shirt
You just look so dang hot in my T-shirt

You see you're spinnin' around in my T-shirt
Right there your hair messed up like a Guns 'N Roses video
Oh-oh so hot in my T-shirt

Right there your hair messed up like a Guns 'N Roses video
Oh-oh so hot you still got it up in my head
You're movin' around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like your dress my floor
No way you wore my my T-shirt

You look good in my T-shirt oh
Yeah you look so good in my T-shirt
You look so good in my T-shirt
