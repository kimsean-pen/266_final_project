Quietly
explodes your love
your insecurity is so soft to me
I can't let you breathe in
we are falling into us
I see you dying in my eyes

Just let it all go
you are left, and so am I
(we go insane)
just let it all go
you're left, so am I
we leave all inside

Quietly
we arrive
my insecurity is so soft to you
you can't let me breathe in
we are falling in too deep
I'm dying in your open mouth

Just let it all go
you are left, so am I
(we go insane)
just let it all go
you're left, so am I
you leave all
you leave all inside
let it all go
you're left, so am i
(we go insane)
let it all go
you're left, so am I
we leave all inside

so you can't leave them all,
so can't leave them all inside
and we can't go all, it's right
it's a fact we can't deny,
if you have to go,
please go quiet,
please go quietly

Just let it all go
you are left, so am I
(we go insane)
just let it all go,
you're left, so am I
we leave all
we leave all inside
let it all go
you're left, so am i
(we go insane)
let it all go
you're left, so am I
you leave all inside

let it all go
