Beneath this wave
I just can't take your breath away

You cut me down
You know I'll always be around
So now I wait
I know you'll live another day
Come and take my breath away
Look me straight in the face

Cause you know it's over
Growing colder
I need something
Leave me next to nothing
All we ever wanted
I need something
Leave me next to nothing
Next to nothing

I cut you down
I know you'll always be around
So now you'll wait
I know you'll live another day
Come and take my breath away
Look me straight in the face

Cause you know it's over
Growing colder
I need something
Leave me next to nothing
All we ever wanted
I need something
Leave me next to nothing
Next to nothing

Next to nothing
Next to nothing
Next to nothing

Woo

Cause you know it's over
Growing colder
I need something
Leave me next to nothing
All we ever wanted
I need something
Leave me next to nothing
Next to nothing

Yeah
