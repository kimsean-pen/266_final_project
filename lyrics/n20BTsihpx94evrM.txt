Suck the soul right through the mouth
My family needs to feast
It feels good for a minute, but then it goes
My sisters need to eat

You wanna see it through my eyes?
You don't
You can't feel it from the inside
You had the chance, you won't

We just aren't there anymore
I don't wanna play pretend
It's even deeper than before

The voice gets louder every time

You wanna see it through my eyes?
You don't
You can't feel it from the inside
You had the chance, you won't

I'm just not you anymore
I'm just in a different place
Just wanted so much more
I just can't relate
I'm just not you anymore
I'm just in a different place
Just wanted so much more
I just can't relate
I just can't relate
I just can't...
