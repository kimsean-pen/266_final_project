It's never ending a season I can't shake
A foreign winter, a curse I can't escape
I feel the winter burying my bones
A cold reminder that I'm so far from home
I know we're worlds apart
Seasons stitched together somehow

What's it like where you are?

It hurts to know we're always
Worlds apart (Can you feel it, can you feel it)
This burning I feel is slowing down my heart
(Can you feel it, can you feel it)
It hurts to know we're worlds apart
It hurts to know, what its like where you are

A fire in my skin an ache in every burn
My soul is sinking the cold is creeping in
I feel the winter burying my bones
A cold reminder that I'm so far from home
I know we're worlds apart
Seasons stitched together somehow

What's it like where you are?
I can't recall I'm too far

It hurts to know we're always
Worlds apart (Can you feel it, can you feel it)
This burning I feel is slowing down my heart
(Can you feel it, can you feel it)
It hurts to know we're worlds apart
It hurts to know, what its like where you are

I can see my breath floating away
The warmth in me escapes
I can't recall I'm too far!
It hurts to know we're always
Worlds apart (Can you feel it, can you feel it)
This burning I feel is slowing down my heart
(Can you feel it, can you feel it)
It hurts to know we're worlds apart
It hurts to know, what its like where you are
