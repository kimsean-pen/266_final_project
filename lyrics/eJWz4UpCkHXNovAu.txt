The man who answers
Bleeding sky
Cry for hours
Dropping peace bombs
Scarlet mirrors
Scarlet stains
I see

I have been to the mountain
And I have walked on the shore
I have seen
But I can't see 'em no more

Round the mouth
Make an echo
Destroy the destroyer
And do it fast
That man lived in this town
Til that pig took him down
And have you heard the sound
Of a man stop breathing, breathing?

I have been to the valley
And I have sung all her songs
Watch me see
Watch me sing along
And I say
"I have been to the mountain
And I have walked on her shore
I have seen
But I can't see 'em no more"
