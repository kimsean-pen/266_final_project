One thought has me turning back
A dozen point the other way
Reactable desire, reach your hand for higher
And patience is worth the wait

You've got knives in your eyes
You would be happy not to change your mind
I can't defend you truly
When I worry about smoke instead of putting out the fire

And if we work it out
Chances are bound we'd be standing our ground
For no one's better sake
Goodbye

What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?

What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?

How faint might that light become
When focused at from miles away?
Although my position just gives you an ignition
Be certain that I know my place

So is this how it ends?
Oh, with a whimper in the place of a bang
I can't defend you truly
When I worry about smoke instead of putting out the fire

And if we work it out
Chances are bound we'd be standing around
For no one's better sake
Goodbye

We would be friends if we tried again
I'd take second place just to end the race
For no one's better sake
Goodbye
