I know that the rain falls hard when it falls and I know you're more of the relaxing in the sunshine type of person
It hurts when you gotta be at home and stay inside
Scream and shout, throw your hands up until you go blue in the face
You can try all you want you still won't make things change

You could like the afternoon or night time and I'll like the morning
I was thinking you could love a song that I hate, I'd still play it for you
If you know that it's a game, you make the rules and you can play and you can laugh when you're behind

You want to run away to somewhere warm
I know it's cold but if you wait you'll enjoy it more
It's not as serious as you might think

You're probably looking away while you scream and shout, throw your hands up until you go blue in the face
You can try all you want you still won't make things change
After you know it's all a game then when it storms play in the rain
