You're cold, like a stone.
How did you get that way?
How did you get that way?
You're cold, like a stone.
How did you get that way?
Why did you get that way, with me?

The seasons over, the rest is fine
And I grow colder all the time
With never feeling lonely.
And I don't want to break no more
And I don't want to know the score
I don't want to know who's really happy.

The summer spun us into rough terrain
And across the country, hung my head in shame.
And I don't know what you do with your days
But I don't want to collide so I'm drawing
Yellow lines between you and I suggest, we don't talk about it.

All the lines I drew, while waiting for you.
All the lines I drew, while waiting for you.

The rest is fine and so am I.
I won't count the clocks again.
Cause if time runs out and I find out
It won't be my problem them.

Cause you've pulled me above and beneath
My goals and it shows and grows and grows and grows.
Thrashing wildly in the core of my soul
It's getting old.
And now it's come to this.
Reaching my arms across the empty space next to me.
Watching TV to keep away the bad dreams.

All the lines I drew, while waiting for you.
All the lines I drew, while waiting for you, you.

Oh, you will take one step back, for that, for me.You will take one step back for that for me.
Oh, you will take one step back, for that, for me.
