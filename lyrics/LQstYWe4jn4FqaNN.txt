It's true baby I sleep 'til noon for breakfast
I have a little smoke then I get up and go
And yes I'm always two hours late for work babe
It's hard being a slave to your body and soul

You know I'm only bragging
Boss is always nagging
My ass is dragging but they don't know
You think I've kinda messed around
But I'll never let you down
So have some faith I'm sticking around
Sticking around!

I bet your body's so sweet (oh yeah)
So roll your dice at my feet (oh yeah)
We're winning when our eyes meet (oh yeah)
You've got that hand I can't beat (oh yeah)
So put your money on me
Put your money on me
So put your money on me
Put your money on me
I know I've got a bad bad reputation

I'm not afraid to look a girl right in the eye
And so I'll tell you for your information
Just know I'm not that kind of guy
Let's start a revolution

This ain't no illusion
Your disillusion will turn me around
So yeah I like to flirt girl
Don't forget that you're my world
So keep the faith I'm sticking around
Sticking around!

I bet your body's so sweet (oh yeah)
So roll your dice at my feet (oh yeah)
We're winning when our eyes meet (oh yeah)
You've got that hand I can't beat (oh yeah)
So put your money on me
Put your money on me
So put your money on me
Put your money on me
I wanna do it
I wanna do it now

I bet your body's so sweet (oh yeah)
So roll your dice at my feet (oh yeah)
We're winning when our eyes meet (oh yeah)
You've got that hand I can't beat (oh yeah)

I bet your body's so sweet (oh yeah)
So roll your dice at my feet (oh yeah)
We're winning when our eyes meet (oh yeah)
You've got that hand I can't beat (oh yeah)
So put your money on me
Put your money on me
So put your money on me
Put your money on me
