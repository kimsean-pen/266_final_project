I think it's about time I was leaving
you're stumbling over words I don't believe in
but I'm finding new legs to walk with
I've been finding new knives to kiss with

when you sleep your body turns a ghost white
and I can't help but feeling like a fly on milk
I crawled back into myself alone

darling, I was old enough

I am writhing with certainty
I am dancing with the slow death
trembling like a drop of mercury
I touched your wrist beneath the blanket

no use now in trying to change our old ways
when someone else's name is stuck
between your shoulderblades
here are my hands
reminding you of someone else's hands

darling, I was old enough

god is stuck singing himself to sleep
I am not the only one
