Do you look at a poster
Do you at the wall
The wall in the room where you live
Where you live with your stars
Just listen to his records
Now hear what he says
For he says, "I love you little girl
Come to see me today"

Speedy's Coming
You live in his heart
Speedy's Coming
You live in his heart

Do you like Alice Cooper
Do you like Ringo Starr
You like David Bowie
And friends in the Royal Albert Hall
Stick up the pictures, movies, TV
And I'll bring you the show little girl
Come to see me today

Speedy's Coming
You live in his heart
Speedy's Coming
You live in his heart

Do you like Alice Cooper
Do you like Ringo Starr
You like David Bowie
And friends in the Royal Albert Hall
Stick up the pictures, movies, TV
And I'll bring you the show little girl
Come to see me today

Speedy's Coming
You live in his heart
Speedy's Coming
You live in his heart
Speedy's Coming
You live in his heart
Speedy's Coming
You live in his heart
