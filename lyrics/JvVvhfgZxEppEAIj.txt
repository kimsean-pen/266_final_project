Hey you, you say you wanna change the world
It's alright, with me there's no regret
It's my turn, the circle game has brought me here
And I won't let down 'til every song is set

You realize now
You should have tried now, ooh
The music's gone now
You lost it somehow
Hey you, sha la la la
Hey you, sha la la la
Woo! Sha la la
Woo! Sha la la

Hey you, you say the race is much too fast
It's okay, with me I'm keeping pace
It's my game, the music is inside my head
For every one on top there's one who can't retrace

You realize now
You should have tried now, ooh ooh
The music's gone now, you'll find out
You lost it somehow
Hey you, sha la la la
Hey you, sha la la la
Woo! Sha la la
Woo! Sha la la

You realize now, ooh
You could have tried now
The music's gone now
You lost it somehow
Hey you, hey you, sha la la la
Hey you, sha la la la
Woo! Sha la la
Woo! Sha la la

Sha la la la, hey you, hey you, hey you (Woo!)
Sha la la la, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baby, it's true (Woo!)
Sha la la la, no time, no time left, no time (Woo!)
Sha la la la, don't let me down, don't let me down (Woo!)
Sha la la la, you gotta learn to take it easy, baby (Woo!)
Sha la la la, music's over, it's over (Woo!)
Sha la la la, too late, too late, too late (Woo!)
Sha la la la, I should have realised it a lot sooner than this (Woo!)
Sha la la la, hey you
