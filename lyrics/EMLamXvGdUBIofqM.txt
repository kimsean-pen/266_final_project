I hear her voice in the morning shower
See her waiting from the water tower
See her falling through the fog in the mirror
See her waving from a painted island
And that's my baby, say goodbye
Without my baby, let me die
Oh yeah, die, uh-huh
I just don't feel okay without her near me
Keep on clutching onto life so dearly
It filters into me through every pore
The haunting light under the bedroom door

And that's my baby, say goodbye
Without my baby, let me die
Oh yeah, die, uh-huh
Oh wee-ee ooooh
Sha la la
And that's my baby, say goodbye
Without my baby, let me die
Oh yeah, die, uh-huh
Baby say goodbye
Oh yeah
