Going on and on and on and on
This is going on and on and on and on now
Said it once and say it twice
I want to save your time
Safety, safety

It's alright, it's alright
'Cause the system never fails
The good guys are in power
And the bad guys are in jail

It's alright, it's alright
Just as long as we can vote
We live in democracy
And that's what we promote

Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it?

It's alright, it's alright
If the news says half the truth
Hearing what we want's the secret of eternal youth

It's alright, it's alright
If the planet splits in three
'Cause I'll keep selling records, and you've got your MTV

If we forget about them, don't worry
If they forget about us, then hurry
How about the people who don't matter anymore?
East Timor, Timor, Timor

It's alright, it's alright
They don't show it all on TV
So we won't really know it
Just by watching BC

It's alright, it's alright
For our flag, we die or kill
As long as we don't know
We'd do it just to pay their bills

If we forget about them, don't worry
If they forget about us, then hurry
How about the people who don't matter anymore?

If we forget about them, don't worry
If they forget about us, then hurry
How about the people who don't matter anymore?
East Timor, Timor, Timor

Let's keep tanning while it's sunny
They'll risk our hides to make their money
Now don't you find that funny?

If we forget about them
If they forget about us, then hurry
How about the people who don't matter anymore?

If we forget about them, don't worry
If they forget about us, then hurry
How about the people who don't matter anymore?
