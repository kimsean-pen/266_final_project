We stagger sideways
Congregate
Nearing the dawn
Of designation

Right through a corridor
Of white
Mud and sheer
Doubt

And I wonder
Could you come back around
I'm spelled under
Some hazy little vows

Loosely spun eyes
Behold the disguise
Obscure the seasons hereby
While the white queen fades by
Ooh
While the white queen fades by
Ooh, oh, oh
While the white queen

Drawing borders
Instigate
Singing psalms
Of decimation

Bleeds through a cylinder
Of white
Light and pure
Glint

While the white queen fades
While the white queen
While the white queen fades by
