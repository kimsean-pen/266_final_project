You'll never meet my mom,
Strings will never be attached,
We'll always get along,
'Cause it doesn't have to last,
Anytime I call you, you don't have to call me back,
I'm never gonna fall, but I'm never hard to catch.

She say she's cool with it, She's down with it,
There's nothing wrong with it 'cause its easier this way,
She's so cool with it, She's down with it,
There's nothing wrong with it, Don't want it any other way.
It's just you're typical hardcore, casual sex,
Single but we're lovers, crazy for each other,
Just you're typical hardcore, casual sex,
We're wild under the covers, crazy for each other.

We don't have to go on dates,
You don't have to like my friends,
I'll poke it in your face when you makin' other plans,
If you tired of the taste,
We can try another blend,
My heart will never break I'm just here to break a sweat.

That's why she's cool with it, She's down with it,
There's nothing wrong with it 'cause its easier this way,
She's so cool with it, She's down with it,
There's nothing wrong with it, Don't want it any other way.
It's just you're typical hardcore, casual sex,
Single but we're lovers, crazy for each other,
Just you're typical hardcore, casual sex,
We're wild under the covers, crazy for each other.

She's so cool with it, She's down with it,
There's nothing wrong with it 'cause its easier this way,
She's so cool with it, She's down with it,
There's nothing wrong with it, Don't want it any other way.
It's just you're typical hardcore, casual sex,
Single but we're lovers, crazy for each other,
Just you're typical hardcore, casual sex,
We're wild under the covers, crazy for each other.

Everybody want's a lover like that,
Fire under the covers, crazy for each other,
Everybody wants a lover her like that
Fire under the covers, crazy for each other.
