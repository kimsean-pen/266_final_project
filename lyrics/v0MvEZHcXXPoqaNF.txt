Little bit lost
And
A little bit lonely
A little bit cold here
A little bit of fear
But I
Hold on
Then I
Feel strong
Then I
Know that I can
Getting used to it
Lit the fuse to it
Lighting all the wires

Been talking to myself forever
Yeah
And how I wish I knew it'd be better
Yeah
Still sitting on a shelf but never
Never seen the sun shine brighter
And it feels like me

On a good day

And it feels like me
On a good day

I'm a little bit hemmed in
A little bit isolated
A little bit hopeful
A little bit cold
But I
Hold on
Then I
Feel strong
Then I
Know that I can

Getting used to it
Lit the fuse to it
Lighting all the wires

Been talking to myself forever
Yeah
And how I wish I knew it'd be better
Yeah

Still sitting on a shelf but never
Never seen the sun shine brighter
And it feels like me
On a good day

Been talking to myself forever
Yeah
And how I wish I knew it'd be better

Yeah
Still sitting on a shelf but never
Never seen the sun shine brighter
And it feels like me
On a good day

Been talking to myself forever
Yeah
And how I wish I knew it'd be better
Yeah
Still sitting on a shelf but never
Never seen the sun shine brighter
And it feels like me
On a good day
