I am from Salinas where the women go forever
And they never ever to stop to ask why
My mother was a saviour of six foot of bad behaviour
With long, blond curly hair down to her thigh

Oh my mother
Oh my friends
Ask the angels "Will I ever see heaven again?"

Late into the evening, they would take each other screaming
Looking darkly to the back of her eye

The careless beast was bleating that the air behind was breathing
That they musn't ever look up to the sky

There are no answers
There are found
Ask the angels, "Am I heaven-bound?"
"Oh am I heaven-bound?"

Put it down to me
I, who speak awkwardly
Any word, if it is heard, is not intended to be
Not for them, not for her
Not for him, and not for me

Oh and that gun would turn before the sun starts to burn, understand

When the clouds roll in, we start paying for our sins
With a gun in my hand and my sun at my shoulder
Believe I will run before that boy gets older

Oh and that gun would turn before the sun starts to burn, understand
Oh and that gun would turn before the sun starts to burn, understand

I am from Salinas where the women go forever
And they never ever stop to ask why
My mother, she's a saviour of six foot of bad behaviour
With long, blond curly hair down to her thigh

Oh my mother
Oh my friends
Ask the angels, "Will I ever see heaven again?"
Will I ever see even again?
Will I ever see even again?

Punish them all, for they speak too much
Hate the world for what it did to us

Will I ever see heaven again?
