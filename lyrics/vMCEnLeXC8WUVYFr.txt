Yea, so much problem with my so-called friends
Problem with the girl I love
Whole heap a them a say dem know Popcaan
Dem never know the place I was
People who know the real struggle mi feel
A people like squid and cuz
This music biz is like a battle to me
So much fucking hatred and grudge

Now in a the midst of all these enemies
Jah, you keep me firm and strong
Bad mind and jealousy just get defeat
Jah, you keep me firm and storng
Give me the energy me need
Jah, you keep me firm and strong
Unruly keep winning by any means, yea
Jah, you keep me firm and strong
Strong already, strong already you know
Strong already, strong already, strong already you know

Me nuh friendly with the media
Everyone already know
Some people gone believe everything them see on TV
Everything them hear on radio (Fool)
Them see you with you thing a it them want
Them plan up how fi take it from you
God nah guh vex if a mi gun mi draw
Empty a matic pon you

But in a the midst of all these enemies
Jah, you keep me firm and strong
Bad mind and jealousy just get defeat
Jah, you keep me firm and storng
Give me the energy me need
Jah, you keep me firm and strong
Unruly keep winning by any means, yea
Jah, you keep me firm and strong
Strong already
Strong already you know
Strong already, strong already, strong already you know

Them don't want fi see we happy
Them don't want fi see me make it out, oh
What do some photocopy
The most power them gain is with them mouth
All who a try stop poppy
That a something what me doubt
Billions fi Notnice, billions fi Dre Skull
Ghetto youths fi make it and no be ungrateful
Big house on the hill you know a button gate pull
Pretty gyal a gimmie wings like Redbull
Old iron deh pon me waist you know say every clip full
You can't trust the dutty nigga them, them very skillful, eh

Now in a the midst of all these enemies
Jah, you keep me firm and strong
Bad mind and jealousy just get defeat
Jah, you keep me firm and storng
Give me the energy me need
Jah, you keep me firm and strong
Unruly keep winning by any means, yea
Jah, you keep me firm and strong
Strong already
Strong already you know
Strong already, strong already, strong already you know

Give me the energy me need
