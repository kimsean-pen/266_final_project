I got whatever
I got whatever
I got whatever
I got whatever
I got it, I got whatever
I got whatever
I got whatever

I got it, I got whatever
I'm playing with my bitch bad, she can't get no better
My engine it running and revving forever,
Whenever I'm using the clutch and the pedal
I got whatever, I got whatever
I'll fuck her however, whenever, wherever, forever
I keep the pistol for whoever, whenever, whichever
Endeavor, encounter if ever
I got whatever
I got it, I got whatever
These Maison Margielas
You jealous pull up in a Tesla
Whenever, however, no matter the weather
I fucked up a sixty I could bought a bezel
I got whatever, I got whatever
I picked up molly and codeine
Almost poured the whole thing
I walked inside bought a designer sweater for 14
Stop by your trap and I'll pick up the package the whole thing
The bitch on my lap you run up I get rid of the whole thing

I got whatever
I got whatever
I got it, I got whatever
I got whatever
I got whatever
I got whatever
I got whatever
I got whatever
I got whatever
I got it
