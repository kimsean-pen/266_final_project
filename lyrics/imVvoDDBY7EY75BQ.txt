I see your faces and I do not understand why
each time I dream you're standing there right by my side.
Why do you make me? You take my pride
and in my eyes, you kinda rape me... inside.
I have no place to run and hide.
I have no place to hide, which I like.
Some will look at the time I looked back into my life.
You wanna touch me to see what's in my eyes.
Why do you make me, remember my hate, all this shame?
Don't you hate me? Sometimes
I have no place to run and hide.
I have no place to hide which I like.
I have no place to run so come on follow me.
I have no place to run so come on follow me.
I have no place to run so come on follow me.
I have no place to run so come on follow me.
I have no place to run so come on follow me.
I have no place to run so come on follow me.
I have no place to run so come on follow me.
I have no place to run so come on follow me.
I have no place to run so come on follow me.
I have no place to run.
Which I like... I like.
Which I like... I like.
Which I like... I like.
Which I like... I like.
Which I like... I like.
Which I like... I like.
Which I like... I like.
Which I like... I like.
