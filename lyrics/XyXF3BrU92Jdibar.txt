I don't wanna be so complicated
I wish it was new
Down in a new river
I just want the fire
In my heart above it
And I wanna see
A simple new life

I wanna go
I just wanna ride with you
'Cause then I know I'll be by your side
With you tonight

I live in this world that I created
I did it for you
I wish to be your love and save you
I tried to turn back the time
I've got to reach against the ages
And now I realise
You were the one I always run to
O, darling

I... I'd rather think it's time we go
Oh, I'll let it go

I don't know myself
When you are not around
I won't realise
All I got until it's gone
Just let the fire, fire burn
O, darling

With you
Oh why is it so newer beside (with you)
With you for all the lies (with you tonight)
Tonight
