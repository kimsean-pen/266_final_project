I saw your face and that was enough
I turned away and my whole world shook
Took a minute to take some time and catch my breath

When I'm inside your arms
This racing in my heart
I'll never come to harm with you

Cause I can never get enough of you
And every little thing you do
you're insatiable
It's like woah! Who knew?
That I had so much more to give
I didn't know this could exist
you're insatiable

In, in, sa satiable
You make me lose my control
In, in, sa satiable
You make me lose my control

You had a look that made me wonder
Here comes the rain cause I hear thunder
Come close and keep me safe tonight

When I'm inside your arms
This racing in my heart
And I'll never come to harm with you

Cause I can never get enough of you
And every little thing you do
you're insatiable
It's like woah! Who knew?
That I had so much more to give
I didn't know this could exis
you're insatiable
This time is through
But it's given me a second chance
You got me with a single glance
you're insatiable

Insatiable
Insatiable (you're insatiable)
Insatiable
Insatiable

Cause I can never get enough of you
And every little thing you do- you're insatiable
It's like woah! Who knew?
That I had so much more to give
I didn't know this could exist- you're insatiable
This time is through
But it's given me a second chance
You got me with a single glance- you're insatiable

It's like woahh! Who knew?
That I had so much more to give
I didn't know this could exist
You're insatiable
