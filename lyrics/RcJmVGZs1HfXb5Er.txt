Somewhere underneath
The floorboard
I will sweep my garden

Underneath the cupboard
Lives a mouse
And he discovered
There was nothing there

Nothin' there to discover

Fallin' from the sky
There are raindrops in my eyes
And my thoughts are diggin' in the backyard
My roots have grown but I don't know where they are

Don't know where they are
I don't know where they are
My roots have grown but I don't know where they are

Cats and dogs and rooster calls
Telephones and pay phone stalls

They take away
The lonely days
For now

They take away
The lonely days
For now
