"Caution"

Ooh, oh-oh-oh, Oh
Ooh, oh-oh-oh, Oh
Ooh, oh-oh-oh, Oh
Ooh, oh-oh-oh, Oh

Oh, I
I see what I'm dealing with
See, you
You don't understand my gangsta
When I
See something I want
Then I just take and make it mine
All mine

I, lick my lips and then
I think about how sweet it is to be me
So to date me must be high
Well if you gon keep playin round
You gon have to figure out

Cause there ain't no defense
When I'm callin
Red hot scalding
And I'm callin for you, you, you, you
What else can you do?
Caution you're falling

Now I, I don't think you realize
That you, You don't even have a chance
When I, spit my G at you
I bet you won't know how to act
(Its that bad)

I like my lips and then
I think about how sweet my touches maybe
So to feel me must be high
Well if you didn't know
You know now
Exactly how it's going down

Cause there ain't no defense
When I'm callin
Red hot scalding
And I'm callin for you, you, you, you
What else can you do?
Caution you're falling

See you don't understand
The woman that I am
And even if you did
Well could you handle it?
(All of the love I give so)
Good, Good

And its sho'll alright

Cause there ain't no defense
When I'm callin
Red hot scalding
And I'm callin for you, you, you, you
What else can you do?
Caution you're falling

I'm, giving you the low-down
What it is to be with me
Just, one conversation
And you find yourself yearning me
What else can you do?
Caution you're falling
