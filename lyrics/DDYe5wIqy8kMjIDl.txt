Remember boy that your forefathers died
Lost in millions for a country's pride
They never mention the trenches of Belgium
When they stopped fighting and they were one

A spirit stronger than war was working that night
December 1914 cold, clear and bright
Countries' borders were right out of sight
They joined together and decided not to fight

All together now
All together now
All together now
In no man's land, together

All together now
(All together now)
All together now
(All together now)

All together now
(Together, together)
In no man's land, together
The same old story again

All those tears shed in vain
Nothing learnt and nothing gained
Only hope remains
All together now

All together now
All together now
In no man's land, together
All together now

(All together)
All together now
(All together)
All together now

In no man's land, together
All together now
(All together, now)
All together now
(All together... now)

All together now
(Together, together)...
In no man's land, together

(All together now)
(All together now)
The boys had their say, they said no
Stop the slaughter and let's go home
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go home!
All together now
(Together, together)
In no man's land, togeeeether
All together now
All together now...
