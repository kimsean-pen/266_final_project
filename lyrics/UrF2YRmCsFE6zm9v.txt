Things have been a little strange since I met you
Like I'm stuck in a frame, can't forget you
Everywhere I go, somebody screaming's your name
Lucky number 7, even born the same day
I'll ride with you if it's alright with you
I wanna drive to the beach, spend my life with you
Drift away to the river in the sky with you
I think I see the sun
Wanna go with you, baby, wanna rise with you
Play around in the night with you
I think I see the sun
I'll ride with you if it's alright with you
I wanna drive to the beach, spend my life with you
Drift away to the river in the sky with you
I think I see the sun
Wanna go with you, baby, wanna rise with you
Play around in the night with you
I think I see the sun
