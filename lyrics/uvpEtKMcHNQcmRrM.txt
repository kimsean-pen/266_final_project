As I lay me down
Heaven, hear me now
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all

Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to?

I look to you
I look to you

After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you
I look to you, yeah

And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song
I look to you

About to lose my breath
There's no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door

And every road that I've taken
Led to my regret
And I don't know if I'm gon' make it
Nothing to do, but lift my head

I look to you
I look to you, yeah

And when all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you
I look to you, oh, yeah

And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song
I look to you

(My levees have broken) My lev-
(My walls have come) Coming down on me
(Crumbling down on me) Oh, the rain is falling

(The rain is falling) Wooh!
(Defeat is calling) Set me free
(I need you to set me free)

Take me far away from the battle
I need you, shine on me

I look to you
I look to you

After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you
I look to you, yeah

And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song
I look to you, yeah

I look to you
I look to you
