Ride!
As we are born to be wild
Push your boundaries
Fight!
As if we're ready to conquer all the obstacles
Ride!
Put all your troubles aside
Drop your worries
Guide!
Light up the steep road that lies ahead
Sealed in sweat

I have the power
To let you rise

Ride!
As we are born to be wild
Push your limits
Fight!
As if we're ready to conquer all the obstacles
Ride!
Move on believe in yourself
Drop your shackles
Smile!
Move on with passion and disregard
Wicked guides

I have the power
To make you shine
Do not betray me
I'll let you fall

My prison of treason
Prevail or die!
Feed the force within
Don't give up the fight begins

Canalize your force
Keep your mind free of strain
Mesmerize, energize

Trust yourself and banish fear
Find your way to persevere

I have the power
To make you shine
But if I want to I'll drop you all

My prison of treason
Prevail or die!
Feed the force within
Don't give up the fight begins
The rhythm of freedom
Prevail or die!
Dodging makes no sense
Don't fall prey to diffidence

Live your life intense and pure
Realize your dreams
Do not wait
For opportunity
Create your destiny
Live as free as you can be
To guard your legacy
Use your strength to reach your goals in life
You're one of a kind

My prison of treason
Prevail or die!
Feed the force within
Don't give up the fight begins
The rhythm of freedom
Prevail or die!
Dodging makes no sense
Don't fall prey to diffidence

Ride!
As we are born to be wild
Push your boundaries
Fight!
As we are ready to turn away
Misery
