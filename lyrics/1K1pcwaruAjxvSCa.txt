And everyone started to come after me
And everyone started to touch me
I don't understand, whoever I meet
They always reach out to touch me

Imagine: touched by somebody who loves you

An itch that started to follow me
The sensation would cut in a sister
A world of pain, the digits spree
Have you ever felt a sister?
Imagine: touched by somebody who loves you
Imagine: touched by somebody who loves you

Then everyone started to come after me
And everyone started to touch me
I don't understand, whoever I meet
They always reach out to touch me

Imagine: touched by somebody who loves you
Imagine: touched by somebody who loves you

An itch that started to follow me
The sensation would cut in a sister
A world of pain, the digits spree
Have you ever felt a sister?
Imagine: touched by somebody who loves you
Imagine: touched by somebody who loves you
