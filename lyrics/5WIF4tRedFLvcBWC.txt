Always looking for your next climb
The things I want don't take time
Or money, honey you'll get it
One of these days
One of these days, when love ignites
We're gonna get it and get it right
One of these days

If I'm talking sweet to you
You know I'd like to hear it too
It's funny, honey to think
It's a passing phase
But if I feel alone in the morning dew
I start to see
New shades of blue

One of these days
You know I'm gonna set our hearts ablaze
If it's my last living deal

If I feel our loving fade
You may as well turn the blade
It's running, honey my mouth
I know, for days
But the Robin's singing
The same old song
I ain't doing nothing wrong

One of these days
You know I'm gonna set our hearts ablaze
If it's the last thing I do

One of these days
You know I'm gonna set our hearts ablaze
If it's the last thing I do

If it's true that I feel
More for you than you do for me
It's stunning, honey how love
Has some delays
'Cause one of these days
Our love takes flight
We're gonna get it
And get it right
One of these days
