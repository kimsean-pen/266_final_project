It's not that easy with you here
But I know I want you to stay
See this could be us in a few years
But just admit you like to play

It's like everyday
I'm kicking rocks.
I could fly away
but you got me at a complete stop

How do you
manage to keep me going
but somehow you keep me from going

See you distract me, but I'm distracted without you
I don't know how to focus baby teach me how to
Cause I'm standing still again
But if you love me, just like the way that I love you
I wouldn't mind a little comforting from you
Why do I let you in my head?

And I gotta go sometimes, but you're always on my mind
You're not helping me
You're not helping me
You're not helping me
You're not helping me
You're not helping me
But I helplessly fall, for you

Now I'm running late
And I'm not a coffee drinker
But I lost sleep just thinking of you
So pour me a cup
I need to wake up
I need me some love
Now give it to me

Cause everywhere you go I'll follow you
I'll give you all of me, give me all of you
I gotta go sometimes
But you're always on my mind

See you distract me, but I'm distracted without you
I don't know how to focus baby teach me how to
Cause I'm standing still again
Cause if you love me, just like the way that I love you
I wouldn't mind a little comforting from you
Why do I let you in my head?
No
And I gotta go sometimes, but you're always on my mind
You're not helping me babe
You're not helping me babe
But I fall helplessly for you, for you.
You're not helping me babe
You're not helping me babe
But I fall helplessly for you, for you.
