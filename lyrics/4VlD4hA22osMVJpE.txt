Inner beauty
Like shearing a spark
That's speak mumbo
Tall and giraffe-like

Go down
Go down in my lake

Hit me in the water
And live for a while

Do it paradise style

Couplings frolic
On my metal surf

On my next look around
At aged love-lings and new borns

It's still here
All of it
To gawk
You gotta go get higher
And die for a while
