There's this girl, I met the other day
She had that something, I couldn't turn away

Oh she's fine, I wish she could be mine
I can't believe, I let her run away

If you see that girl, send her my way
Cause I need lovin' lovin', I need lovin' lovin'
Will I see her face another day?
Cause I need lovin' lovin', I need lovin' lovin'

She moved like a queen, such a thing I've never seen
And damn, she had the groove in her jeans

She shines like a halo, makes me go volcano
Should've made her stay tho', how could I leave her solo?

If you see that girl, send her my way
Cause I need lovin' lovin', I need lovin' lovin'
Will I see her face another day?
Cause I need lovin' lovin', I need lovin' lovin'

I need her love, no I can't stop
How do I breathe, when she's all over me
Now she's high, makes me go fly
And I can't hide, that her shine makes me go blind

I need her love, no I can't stop
How do I breathe, when she's all over me? (when she's all over me)

If you see that girl, send her my way
Cause I need lovin' lovin', I need lovin' lovin'
Will I see her face another day
Cause I need lovin' lovin', I need lovin' lovin'

If you see that girl, send her my way
Cause I need lovin' baby
Send me lovin'

If you see that girl, send her my way
Cause I need lovin' lovin', I need lovin' lovin'
Will I see her face another day?
Cause I need lovin' lovin', I need lovin' lovin'
