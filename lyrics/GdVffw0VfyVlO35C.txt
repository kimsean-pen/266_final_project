Hey

I met him at the book store
He said he'd like to get to know me
Just a little more, asked me to dinner
I said, "I'd bring my girlfriend"
He said, "That's cool"

'Cause he was gonna bring
His best friend but something happened
That I wasn't expecting his best friend
All night has my attention

Know it was wrong, I couldn't help it
And I don't care, I'm bein' selfish
Know what I want
And I want your best friend

Ain't gonna front, uh, uh
I want your best friend, hey boy
I think I like your best friend, would you mind
If I dinned with your best friend, switch

And you can take my girlfriend
I hardly know you, so there is no attachments
You take my chair, I'll sit right there
Well, see how that feels

And don't be mean
And make a scene, it ain't a big deal
'Cause somethin' happened
That I wasn't expecting his best friend
All night had my attention

Know it was wrong, I couldn't help it
And I don't care, I'm bein' selfish
Know what I want
And I want your best friend

Ain't gonna front, uh, uh
I want your best friend, hey boy
I think I like your best friend, would you mind
If I dinned with your best friend, switch

See baby, it really ain't a big deal
(Switch)
I mean, you a nice guy and all but
(Switch)

If I met him when I met you
(Switch)
He probably would've got the phone call

Don't make no sense to leave
With the wrong guy when your best friend
Could be the love of my life

Know it was wrong, I couldn't help it
And I don't care, I'm bein' selfish
Know what I want
And I want your best friend

Ain't gonna front, uh uh
I want your best friend, hey boy
I think I like your best friend, would you mind
If I dinned with your best friend, switch?

Somethin' happened unexpected
She didn't think that this would happen
She liked this guy, had a connection

It's just with her dates best friend
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Who would've guessed it that she'd suggest
That they should just switch

Switch, switch, switch, switch, hey boy
I think I like your best friend, would you mind
If I dinned with your best friend, switch?
