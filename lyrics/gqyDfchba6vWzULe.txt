Well I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you wish that you'd never been born
Now you wish you'd never met me
I can be the joker that you couldn't shake off
And I'm gonna make you need me
I'm gonna be the drink that you couldn't put down
I swear it won't be easy
'Cause when you got the Halloween blues, there's never a let down

Well I'm gonna make some money
I'm gonna buy you everything you ever did want
And it's bound to ruin ya, honey
But you shouldn't steal what you never could hoard
And I'm gonna be the fastest
I'm gonna be so quick that you're never quite sure
If you're tough enough to last this
'Cause when you got the Halloween blues, there's a guaranteed cure

Let 'em all, let 'em all, let 'em all, let 'em all
Let 'em all shiver and let them all shake
Get 'em all, get 'em all, get 'em all, get 'em
Get them hysterical, keep them awake

Well I'm gonna be imperious
I'm gonna be the next Harry Belafonte
You might as well be serious
If you've got the answers, you might as well say
There'll be no one who can thrill me
There's not a soul alive's got a half of my brains
But they'll try their best to kill me
'Cause when you got the Halloween blues, it's best to complain

Let 'em all, let 'em all, let 'em all, let 'em all
Let 'em all shiver and let them all shake
Get 'em all, get 'em all, get 'em all, get 'em
Get them hysterical, keep them awake

Let 'em all, let 'em all, let 'em all, let 'em all
Let them all shiver and let them all shake
Get 'em all, get 'em all, get 'em all, get 'em all,
Get 'em all, get 'em all, get 'em all, got 'em all

Let 'em all shiver and them all shake
Get 'em all, get 'em all, get 'em all, get 'em
Get them hysterical, keep them awake
