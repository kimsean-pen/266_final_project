When she laughs
She's got the power of a child in her eyes
And when you cry now
She'll hold you like a man's supposed to be held
I can't get into words how I feel
I get it right on in this song n-n-now
I set her free
Needed a friend to come back to me
Starry eyes

Oh, starry eyes, oh
Standing alone in the light
You could see her cry
With a smile and a wink
And a sparkle in her eyes
She calmly sighed, "I will be all right"
Hey, child you've had to take the pain of a man in the streets
You gotta let me in
I needed a friend even just for one night
Starry eyes
Oh, starry eyes, oh

Oh, starry eyes

Oh, starry eyes
Oh, starry eyes
Oh, starry eyes
Starry.
