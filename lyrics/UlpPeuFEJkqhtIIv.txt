Who taught you how to love?

Just like the wind takes a leaf from the tree
You always know how to dismantle me
Yeah your sleepless vision's making me weak
And it's a comment not a compliment

Justification and apologies
Guess I'm susceptible to more tragedy
Cross your heart but there's not guarantees
It's not fair but who's keeping score?

How many times can a promise be broken?
Who taught you how to love?
Are we on the same side?
We know how to play this game
You fall and then I'll catch you
And then you kiss me goodnight
Close your eyes and think of me
I wanna be with you
Dreaming the same dream
Why you playing around with me?
Are we dreaming the same dream?

Put it away in little compartments
This didn't happen by accident
I've got your back but you're so broken
We always come back for more

How many times can a promise be broken?
Who taught you how to love?
Are we on the same side?
We know how to play this game
You fall and then I'll catch you
And then you kiss me goodnight
Close your eyes and think of me
I wanna be with you
Dreaming the same dream
Why you playing around with me?
Are we dreaming the same dream?

Who taught you how to love?

I try and try and try to understand and there must be a good reason.

Are we on the same side?
We know how to play this game
You fall and then I'll catch you
And then you kiss me goodnight
Close your eyes and think of me
I wanna be with you
Dreaming the same dream
Why you playing around with me?
Are we dreaming the same dream?
Why you playing around with me?
Are we dreaming the same dream?
