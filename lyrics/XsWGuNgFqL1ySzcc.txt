A little place around
A little place around
A little bit from town
A little bit from town

There's a path
It's not a road
No traffic through
No noisy highway
Where I can walk
Between the trees
A strip of green
That's rolling my way
And the moon shines down
The moon shines down

A little piece of ground
A little piece of ground
A sweeter little sound
A sweeter little sound

There's a path
It's not a road
No traffic through
No noisy highway
Where I can walk
Between the trees
A strip of green
That's rolling my way
And the moon shines down
And the moon shines down

To drinking we are bound
To drinking we are bound
Enough to go around
Enough to go around

There's a path
It's not a road
No traffic through
No noisy highway
Where I can walk
Between the trees
A strip of green
That's rolling my way
And the moon shines down
The moon shines down
And the moon shines down
The moon shines down
