A still born boy who didn't get to where
Your mother felt, if you'd have come from there
Your baby arms, that never grow
You save yourself, from a desperate soul

Once again we lost
All control to lust
Once again we loved
And never got to end

A mothers pride, i want to take you down
A degutted child that didnt show
To raise tender, unholy child
Despise your gender and every other life

Once again we lost
All control to lust
Once again we loved
And never got to end
(x2)

Liliths child
She'll hold you down
You cant get by
By burning out
(repeat)
