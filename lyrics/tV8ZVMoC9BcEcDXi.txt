Breathe deep and easy
Swallow this pride
Stare at my shaking hands through bone dry, bloodshot eyes
Clock strip the hours
I count the miles
Will you be there waiting
Awake until sunrise?

I've traveled in darkness
For what seems like days, I
Crawl from the sinkholes
Collapsed under this weight
I know not your sorrow
But I know mine
So say you'll stay and dance with me tonight

In the glow of twilight, our world is finally calm
I felt it complete me
When the stars give way to dawn
A language universal, but I speak not its tongue
Is this a night that spans forever
Or a dawn that never comes?

I've traveled in darkness
For what seems like days, I
Crawl from the sinkholes
Collapsed under this weight
I know not your sorrow
But I know mine
So say you'll stay and dance with me tonight (tonight...)

Tomorrow we might wake in servitude and sadness
I will give you everything if only you would have me
Tomorrow we will sweat and toil
Our hands will quiver caked with soil
Tomorrow we'll give it one last chance
But tonight we dance, but tonight we dance

And for this I've traveled in darkness
For what seems like days, I
Crawl from the sinkholes
Collapsed under this weight
I know not your sorrow
But I know mine
So say you'll stay and dance with me tonight
