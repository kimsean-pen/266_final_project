The worst time, to hit you with my first line, no
Everything seemed fine, when I hold you like you're one-of-a-kind
You said you were a sure sign, it's feeling like the last time
Play it back, it's going over and over
Give it up and pull me through, all of this to tell you...

I've been thinking, take me now, I'm in too far
Can't stop feeling, doesn't matter who you are
This could be my last goodbye
You could stay, I'll be alright
I've been thinking, take me now, I'm in too far

If I might say, all of this seems to float away from...
Your lips when they're kissing me, and your hips when leaving me for
The last time, I'm thinking of the first time, ohh
The first time, I'm thinking of the last time
Play it back, it's going over and over
You're trying me so I'm moving on, all of this to tell you...

I've been thinking, take me now, I'm in too far
Can't stop feeling, doesn't matter who you are
This could be my last goodbye
You could stay, I'll be alright
I've been thinking, take me now, I'm in too far

This is where we left off and I'm trying hard to let go
This is where we left off and I'm still waiting to see if you'll show

The first time, I'm thinking of the last time
The last time, I'm thinking of the first time

I've been thinking, take me now, I'm in too far
Can't stop feeling, doesn't matter who you are
This could be my last goodbye,
You could stay, I'll be alright
I've been thinking, take me now, I'm in too far
