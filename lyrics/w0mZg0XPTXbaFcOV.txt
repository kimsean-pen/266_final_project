I'm losing status at the high school
I used to think that it was my school
WAH WAH WAH WAH

I was the king of every school activity
But that's no more...
Oh mama, what will come of me?

The other night we painted posters
We played some records by the coasters
WAH WAH WAH WAH
A bunch of pom-pom girls
Looked down their nose at me
They had painted tons of posters, I had painted three
I hear the secret whispers Everywhere I go
My school spirit is at an All time low

I'm losing status at the high school
I used to think that it was my school
WAH WAH WAH WAH

Everyone in town knows I'm a handsome football star
I sing and dance and spray my hair And drive a Shiny car
I'm friendly and I'm charming I belong to De Molay
I'm gonna try like mad to Get my status back today
Status back, Baby, Status back, Baby
Status back, Baby, Status back, Baby
