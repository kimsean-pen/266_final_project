I know that it's not okay
That I should be so blind
I know what I want
And I wanna be young
So young, [?]
Reenact our dates
So I can be young while I wait

Just need a future
That's possibly bright
I don't have fun
I wanna be young

You're gonna cry when you hit my age
You're gonna cry when you hit my
My favorite thing, young
So young, so young
Make me play the game
So I can be young while I wait

I'll stay up tonight
Just need a young cunt
That's possibly tight
I know it's dumb
But I wanna be young

It's been a long time since
Since I peed on this rag
It ain't all my fault
I wanna be young
So young, so young
Reenact our dates
So I can be young while I wait

I just need a future
That's possibly bright
I don't have fun
I wanna be young
