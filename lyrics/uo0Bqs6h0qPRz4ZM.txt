1: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley (Bobby Brown)
Hey! And me and she we trampooz alot, several mornings she shampoos my locks
Always have my back she stands true to that
Real type of lovin thank you for that
Yo run barefoot without my shoes and socks
Cause she keep herself clean mi nah go catch nuh rash
And she love mi fi real mi nah fi have nuh cash
And any likkle ting and from mi splish yuh splash
Yo all this blingin is like you forgot
Use cheddar rise the bait then you recruit a rat
So we listen couple speech a Martin Luther chat
Dennis Brown, Bob Marley and some Super Cat (Super Cat!)
Though it seem like she live outside mi bugle shop
Cause she don't have nuh scratches only beauty spot
When one duty start is when one duty stop
One nine to five one five to twelve o clock, yuh see mi
(WOO! WOO! Come on!)

Bobby Brown
Beautiful, here we go again my love, you know

2: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley
And I remember when we met and we began dating
And everything was capaset and we began mating
And then di way mi love her good she give me don rating
Because mi style dem plenty full anuh nuh one way ting
As she got her belly full and a nuh pot scrapings
And the closer we become the more she gravitating
Until we buckle down and there is no escaping
Now we typically become an everyday thing
Regularly physically communicating
Sexually scientifically penetrating
Until she start spiritually resignating
A so mi know she real and seh she a nuh play ting
She is di only Queen di King is designating
A so mi seal the deal I am negotiating
I know it kind of deep but keep on concentrating
Cause Jazzy made the beat and I am clearly stating

Bobby Brown
Beautiful, here we go again my love, you know
I will never let you go, my love, beautiful, here we go
Repeat 1
Repeat Repeat 2
