This means out.
This is your way out.
Do or drown.
Do or drown in torpor...

Leave no trace.
All my files, erased.
Burn my clothes.
Burn my Prada trainers.

Let's sleep together,
Right now!
Relieve the pressure,
Somehow!
Switch off the future,
Right now!
Let's leave, forever.

This is fate.
This is your escape.
Leave here now.
Leave here now - it's over.

Let's sleep together,
Right now!
Relieve the pressure,
Somehow!
Switch off the future,
Right now!
Let's leave forever.

(Please, let me out!
Please, let me out!
Please, let me out!)
