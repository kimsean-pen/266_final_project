Hold on Loose, Don't grip me so tight
I've got no wings to fly but This spirit's taking flight

So tonight, we'll dance,
Let's pretend we rule this town
In tomorrow's dawn,
I'll be long gone
Long gone, long gone

I'll be long gone

Don't hold me loose, please grip me tight
My lungs are paper dry, From fear of losing sight

Take my palms, we'll build a wall around this town
In tomorrow's dawn, you'll be long gone
Long gone, long gone

You'll be long gone
