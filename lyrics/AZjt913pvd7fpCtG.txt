Yeah, love is my religion
Love is my religion
Love is my religion

I'll take you to the temple tonight

All my days, I've been searching
To find out what this life is worth
Through the books and bibles of time
I've made up my mind

I don't condemn, I don't convert
Yeah, this is a calling, have you heard?
Bring all the lovers to the phone
'Cause no one is gonna lose their soul

Hey, love is my religion
(Love is my religion)
Love is my religion
(Love is my religion)
Love is my religion

Hey, you can take it or leave it
And you don't have to believe it

I don't want to fight
Hey, let's go fly a kite
There's nothing that we can't cure
And I'll keep you in my arms for sure

So don't let nobody stop us
Free spirits have to soar
With you, I share the gift
The gift that we now know

Oh, love is my religion
(Love is my religion)
Love is my religion
(Love is my religion)
Love is my religion

I say you can take or leave it
You don't have to believe it

Well, I'm done searching now
I found out what this life is worth, yeah
Not in the books did I find
But by searching my mind, yeah

I don't condemn, I don't convert
This is the calling, have you heard?
Bring all the lovers to the fort
No one is gonna lose their soul

Well, love is my religion
(Love is my religion)
Love is my religion
(Love is my religion)
Love is my religion
Hey, you can take it or leave it
And you don't have to believe it
Love is my religion
(Love is my religion)
Love is my religion
(Love is my religion)
Love is my religion
So you can take it or leave it
Now do you believe?
