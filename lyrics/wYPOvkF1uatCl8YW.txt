I'd heard goodbye, goodbye
over and over, I went hollow
I lost my mind, my mind
life was a bitter pill to swallow

and though I wanted affection, I was tired
of rejection, I kicked the habit
yes, I put love on the shelf, and agreed
with myself I'd never have it

it's like you knew, and you came out
out of nowhere and into my life
it took you a while but you found me
now I'm sure that I'm gonna survive

and it started with a HELLO
take the lead and I will follow
I could love you for the rest of my life
don't you ever let me go-o-o
and it started with a HELLO
I could be your superhero
I could love you for the rest of my life
don't you ever let me go-o-o

I was behind, behind
now I was shy and fasted forwards
all of this time, this time
you have been right around the corner

next time the doctor tells me I have to
swallow a pill to put it in perspective
I'll tell her everything's coming up roses
shockingly better than I expected

'cause I was a fool for believing
there was no one who could change my life
'cause now you've arrived you revived me
now I'm sure that I'm gonna be fine

and it started with a HELLO
take the lead and I will follow
I could love you for the rest of my life
don't you ever let me go-o-o
and it started with a HELLO
I could be your superhero
I could love you for the rest of my life
don't you ever let me go-o-o, go-o-o
don't you ever let me gooo

it's finally real
I found the fantasy
remember the day
when I heard you saaa-aay

HELLO
take the lead and I will follow
I could love you for the rest of my life
don't you ever let me go-o-o
and it started with a HELLO (and it started with a HELLO)
I could be your superhero (I could be your superhero)
I could love you for the rest of my life
don't you ever let me go-o-o, go-o-o
don't you ever let me gooo
