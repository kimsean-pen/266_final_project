Alone in my wonder
A gaze of my lover
I hear the thunder
As they walk away
They walk away
They walk away
They walk away
They walk

Nothing now sacred
Go and forsake this
Pray that I perish
Making me relic
Fills you were hatred
Left me sedated
Look what I'm faced with
No one to cherish
I see your menace
I cannot take this
State of neurosis
Affecting them closest
Making no progress
You're looking hopeless
Live with the dosage
Self medicate
Fills you with hate
Burden you gain
Burn in the street
Righteous pawns
Keep the vermin away

Drown in their wonder
Taking me under
Pray for the thunder
As they walk away
They walk away
They walk away
They walk away
Walk... Away

Met with the devil
A bet that I lost
Paid him my soul
Now fret at the cost
Watching him revel
And laugh at my loss
Sit with the sins
That I failed to wash
Met with the devil
A bet that I lost
Paid him my soul
Now fret at the cost
Watching him revel
And laugh at my loss

Nothing now sacred
You pray and I perish
I see your hatred
This is forsaken
Go on now make it
Go and forsake this
A moment you cherish
Making me relic
It's only makeshift
They only know faceless
I am nobody
I'm just a vestibule
Not holy or special
I'm just a vessel
Your holding your medal
I see your hatred
I see your hatred
Watching you perish

Walk away
They walk away
