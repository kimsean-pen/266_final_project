Remember all the days in the pond
Catchin' wild trout till the break of dawn
Now that you've become a man, looking very mean
Got a nice shiny sports car, keep it very clean

Don't ask him what it was, tell him what it is (2x)
Sing the song now:
Ya mar, ya mar, ya mar, ya mar,
ya mar, ya mar, ya mar,
I got an oh kee pah
She used to be a vampire child, walkin' in the yard
Now that she's become a woman, lookin' very proud

You used to wear a piece of cloth tied around your head
Now she looks so good, wanna love you dead

Don't ask her what it was, tell her what it is (2x)

Sing the song now:
Ya mar, ya mar, ya mar,
ya mar, ya mar, ya mar,
ya mar, you no good pah
