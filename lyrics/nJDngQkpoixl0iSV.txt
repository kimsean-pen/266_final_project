Darling, I'm killed,
I'm in a puddle on the floor,
Waiting for you to return
Oh, what a thrill,
Fascinations galore,
How you tease
How you leave me to burn.
It's so deadly, my dear,
The power of having you near

Until that day
Until the world falls away
Until you say there'll be no more goodbyes
I see it in your eyes
Tomorrow never dies

Darling, you've won,
It's no fun,
Martinis, girls and guns
It's murder on our love affair
But you bet your life, every night
While you're chasing the morning light
You're not the only spy out there.
It's so deadly, my dear,
The power of wanting you near

But until that day
Until the world falls away
Until you say there'll be no more goodbyes
I see it in your eyes
Tomorrow never dies

Until that day
Until the world falls away
Until you say there'll be no more goodbyes
I see it in your eyes

Until that day
Until that day
Until that day...
