Seems so long, fight madness on the brink
Bite your tongue but the blood's not all you'll drink
Not like your mind, sink like the fallen sun
And these tears are the cost of all I've done

Time can't wake your frozen heart
With an ocean in between us, we can only row so far
And love won't wait for you so long
What the hell you thought that heaven had just covered up the sun

Face the dark
Face the dark

Feels so quiet and the stars look different now
For months were silent but we made it out somehow
I think you're right unlike the love you've lost
It's easy to look back and wish our time was not a bust

Time can't wake your frozen heart
With an ocean in between us, we can only row so far
And love won't wait for you so long
What the hell you thought that heaven had just covered up the sun

Face the dark
You face the dark

Only when you walk alone, you hold the night
Lost, set the world alight
Face the dark

Only when you walk alone, you hold the night
Lost, set the world alight
Face the dark

You face the dark
Only when you face the dark
