I rise to greet the day
Despite, the monsters underneath my bed
I grab a pen and count to ten
And spill the contents of my head

This is the here, this is the now
I got to make it somehow
Sometimes it feels as if my brain is bursting out
I write it down

Note to self,
Feed the dog, call the mom, write a song
And rule the world by noon
Note to self,
Make a grade, make your mark, break a leg
And don't forget to always work the room

Cause everything is going by so fast
I just wanna make something at last
But I'm gonna leave the keys up on the shelf
Note to self...
Note to self...
Note to self...

I lose myself inside the night
Despite the demons in my mind
We hit the streets and take his hand
To promise land, ain't far behind

Whether it's right or if it's wrong
I wanna party all night long
Sometimes it feels as if my brain is bursting out
Gotta work it out

Note to self,
Feed the dog, call the mom, write a song
And rule the world by noon
Note to self,
Make a grade, make your mark, break a leg
And don't forget to always work the room
Cause everything is going by so fast
I just wanna make something at last
But I'm gonna leave the keys up on the shelf
Note to self (Note to self)
Note to self...
Note to self...
