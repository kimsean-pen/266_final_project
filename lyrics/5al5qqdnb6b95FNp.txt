Now every day I see you in some other face
they crack a smile, talk a while
try to take your place
my memory serves me far too well

I just sit here on this mountain thinking to myself
you're a fool boy
why don't you go down
find somebody
find somebody else
my memory serves me far too well

It's not as though we just broke up
it's not as though it was yesterday
but something I just can't explain
something in me needs this pain
I know I'll never see your face again

C'mon now
I've got to be strong now

Now everybody's talking about this new decade
like you say the magic number
then just say goodbye to
the stupid mistakes you made
oh my memory serves me far too well

Don't you know that
the years will come and go
some of us will change our lives
some of us still have nothing to show
nothing baby
but memories

And if these wounds
they are self inflicted
I don't really know
how my poor heart could have protected me
but if I have to carry this pain
if you will not share the blame

I deserve to see your face again

C'mon now
you don't have to be so strong now
come back

Come back to me darling
I will make it worth your while
come back to your baby
I miss your kiss
I miss your smile

Seems to me the peace I search to find
ain't gonna be mine until you say you will
don't you keep me waiting for that day
I know, I know, I know
you hear these words that I say

I know, I know, I know
you can't always get what you want
you can't always get what you want
you can't always get what you want
you can't always get what you want...
