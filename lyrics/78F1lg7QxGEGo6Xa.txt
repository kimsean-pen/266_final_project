I know you must go
You'll leave us here
I want you to know
You'll never disappear

You'll carry your weight
Your growing pain
I know you won't break
You'll meet us here again

You'll walk with your fears
You cannot stay
I want you to know
You'll always find your way

Through end of light
The sleepless despair
And silence of the night

The hours of guilt
Through every day
I need you to know
We'll never go away
