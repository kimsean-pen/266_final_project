God of the past
Lie to myself
If we're to fall
What can I do?
Lord of the flesh
Life in my head
Where do we go?
I could be next

God of the past
Blind to my sin
Billions will fall
Billions of years
Lord of the flesh
Caught in myself
I want her back
I want to know the purpose

We can't go back
No one can
Somehow we
Believe we will
We can't go back
No one has
It's over now
We never will
