Slowly fading away
You're lost and so afraid
Where is the hope in a world so cold?
Looking for a distant light
Someone who can save a life
Living in fear that no one will hear your cry
(Can you save me now?)

I am with you
I will carry you through it all
I won't leave you, I will catch you
When you feel like letting go
'Cause you're not, you're not alone

Your heart is full of broken dreams
Just a fading memory
And everything's gone but the pain carries on
Lost in the rain again
When will it ever end?
The arms of relief seem so out of reach
But I, I am here

I am with you
I will carry you through it all
I won't leave you, I will catch you
When you feel like letting go
'Cause you're not, you're not alone

And I will be your hope when you feel like it's over
And I will pick you up when your whole world shatters
And when you're finally in my arms
You'll look up and see, love has a face

I am with you
I will carry you through it all
I won't leave you, I will catch you
When you feel like letting go
'Cause you're not, you're not alone

And I will be your hope (you're not alone)
And I will pick you up
And I will be your hope
And I will be your hope

Slowly fading away
You're lost and so afraid
Where is the hope in a world so cold?
