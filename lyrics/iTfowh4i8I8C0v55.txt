Things that I thought I had put far behind
Find the mind, connect to sever.
I felt deeply how my feelings combined,
It is like they'll never sever.

In a way I started today
To weave garlands for the grave.
It will break me till my knees bend,
It will leave me with nothing in the end.

In a blatant mind my thoughts have entwined,
But if you feel the real, they will divide.
From beyond within, the heart plays its part,
The real and fake forever sever.
