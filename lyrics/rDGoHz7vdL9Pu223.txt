Well, you were there when the wall came down
A baby king with a grown man's crown
And we played in the sun as the curtain was tumbling

Well I was young and I could not see
That if you go won't you please take me
And you told me that I would forget you eventually
Yeah, yeah

I thought it was over but it's not
I thought it was over but it's not

I'm spinning in circles I can't stop
I thought it was over but it's not
I'm in love
With a fool
And you don't know what you've lost
It hurts from the bottom to the top
I thought it was over but it's not
Yeah

Another year and the job was done
The old republic was dead and gone
And the new way of living would be a reality

But it's a while since you shut that door
I lie awake ain't asleep no more
Though the nightmare is gone now I don't have a dream

I thought it was over but it's not
I thought it was over but it's not

I'm spinning in circles I can't stop
I thought it was over but it's not
I'm in love
With a fool
And you don't know what you've lost
It hurts from the bottom to the top
I thought it was over but it's not

Does anybody know?
Does anybody know?
Does anybody know?

I'm spinning in circles I can't stop
I thought it was over but it's not
I'm in love
With a fool
And you don't know what you've lost
It hurts from the bottom to the top
I thought it was over but it's not
