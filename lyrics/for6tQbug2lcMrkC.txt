You hear me talking
Your head is nodding like you agree
My two intentions have lost attention
But that's on me
Want to understand what you understand
Lost in translation can get out of hand
Let's make a new word
That we've never heard
Born out of the need to put our love first

Why don't we communify
Build a bridge, we have to try
To talk and to unify
Can't we just, just communify

You are the one
I choose to care for the one I see
I am the other
I need to trust you with being me

Want to understand what you understand
Lost in translation can get out of hand
Let's make a new word
That we've never heard
Born out of the need to put our love first

Why don't we communify
Build a bridge, we have to try
To talk and to unify
Can't we just, just communify

Why don't we communify
Build a bridge, we have to try
To talk and to unify
Can't we just, just communify

Why don't we communify
Build a bridge, we have to try
To talk and to unify
Can't we just, just communify
