Flashback to the summer
It was you and me
I just wanna know, babe
Why you switched up on me
We would spend the whole day
Walking on the beach
I thought we were ok
Now you're just my old thing

Now I see you're out with the crew
And I don't even know what to do, oh
All I ever wanted was you, but now
The only thing I ever think about
It's everything that you do
The city lights don't shine as bright like when I'm with you, babe, oh
It's like you're acting brand new
I remember all the times you said you'd never change, eh
Girl, why you acting brand new? eh
Say, why you acting brand new? eh
Girl, why you acting brand new? eh
Tell me why you're acting brand new

Ri- Ri Riding through your city
Riding through your town
Wonder if you're still around
Wonder if you're here now
Maybe if I call you
We can talk it out
Baby, we can't play these games, no

Now I see you're out with the crew
And I don't even know what to do now
All I ever wanted was you, but now
The only thing I ever think about
It's everything that you do
The city lights don't shine as bright like when I'm with you, babe, eh
It's like you're acting brand new
I remember all the times you said you'd never change, eh
Girl, why you acting brand new? eh
Say, why you acting brand new? eh
Girl, why you acting brand new? eh
Tell me why you're acting brand new

(Brand new, brand new)
(B-b-b-brand new) (Brand new)
(B-b-brand new)(No, no, no, no, no, no)
(B-b-b-brand new) (B-b-brand new)

It's everything that you do
The city lights don't shine as bright like when I'm with you, babe (when I'm with you, oh)
It's like you're acting brand new
I remember all the times you said you'd never change
Girl, why you acting brand new? eh
Say, why you acting brand new? eh
Girl, why you acting brand new? eh na, na, na, na
Tell me why you're acting brand new
Brand new
