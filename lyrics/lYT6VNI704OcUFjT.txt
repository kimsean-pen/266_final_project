Hangover
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over
Partys over, it aint over
Try to make a bad memory over and over
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over
Partys over, it aint over
Can I find a single piece of me? Game over

Hangover

Hangover
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over
Can I find a single piece of me? Game over
Drink till youre drunk
Smoke like a broke stove
Dont quit, take flight
I cant remember last night
Its aight, this the life of a superstar
Sci-fi with that boy trooping hard, couping cars
Snoop go hard in the paint
Drink another cup until I fall flat
All lead and then some
1-5-1, done dilly
Really for sure that
Im throw back intoxicated
Change over, game over, hangover, faded
Body shed, miss
Catalogue it, yes
hang on one chack yes
Eenie minee moe catch a lady by a toe

Wake up in the morning do the same sh*t

Waking and baking, shaking the flees
Caking and baking, raking the cheese
Early in the morning in the bathroom
On my knees tipping and dripping, flipping the flow
Whipping and dripping a drink on the floor
This is the only way that I was taught a long time ago
Seoul, Korea, youll see a G-a like me-a
Never would there ever be another like he-a
G-A-N-G-S-T-A, nothing left to say
I done smoked my whole day

Drink it up and get sick
Bottoms up, get wasted
Pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up
Oh my God, dammit, theres the f*cking limit
Pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up
But I cant stop
Making bottles pop until the wheels fall off
And I cant quit
I wake up in the morning do the same sh*t
Hangover
Hangover

Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over
Can I find a single piece of me? Game over
