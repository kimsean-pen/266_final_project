Call me a liar, a king or a fool
But sing me a song of prosperity
Higher and higher, the farther we fall
Hard to remember
I will surrender and I'll always wait
Wait as in all of eternity
Hard to remember and hard to forget
This shadow that hangs over me
Take me home to a house on a hill, in oblivion
And take away this shadow over me
Cry me a river, but once you run dry
Say there's a reason you do
Godless endeavors, smothered and broken
All that I wanted was you
Take me home to a house on a hill, in oblivion
Where souls never die all alone
You're longing for love, not for sympathy
So take away the shadow over me
Under the starlight you shine your solitude
Eyes on the ocean and far beyond west of the moon
Take me home to a house on a hill, in oblivion
Where souls never die all alone
You're longing for love, not for sympathy
Over the hills
Home, to your house on a hill, to oblivion
Where souls never die all alone
You're longing for love, not for sympathy
So take away the shadow over me
