Windows are closing to keep me locked
No chance was given to find myself today...
My time of aging... wonder when I'll die...
But When My Time Will Come I Know The Reason WHY!
I have an escape, alone it keeps me safe and in my home
I have a reason, to keep me satisfied until I'm gone
Don't regret the rules I broke
When I die bury me in smoke
Under the world I wait for my fate
My soul is wasting beneath my blissful haze
My time of aging wonder when I'll die
But when my time will come, I know the reason why
I have an escape, alone it keeps me safe and in my home
I have a reason, to keep me satisfied until I'm gone
Don't regret the rules I broke
When I die bury me in smoke
