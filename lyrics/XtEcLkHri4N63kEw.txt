I am a future of a past
A lonely drop in forgotten glass
Hallow sinking fast
Hallow Fate built fast
Do I pretend to play your ways
That I always stay inside the lane
Shallow sinking fast
Shallow Fate

No god, can find a piece we lost
Can save us from these storms
In a tea cup that are drowning me
This bed, full of nails and our bones
Is a taste of all the rose
Are broken wish the ground a speed [?]
It feel good
(It feels good)
(It feels good)

I am a story you once told
A piece of gold now [?] has been showed
(Hallow saint)
(Hallow fate)
You can be stronger than I am
Without the wing of a superman
(Shallow saint)
(Shallow fate)

No god, can find a piece we lost
Can save us from these storms
In a tea cup that are drowning me
This bed, full of nails and [?] our bones
Is a taste of all the rose
Are broken wish the ground a speed [?]
It feel good

It feels good
It feels good
It feels good to me without [?]
It feels good
It feels good
It feels good to me

No god, can find a piece we lost
Can save us from these storms
In a tea cup that are drowning me
This bed, full of nails and [?] our bones
Is a taste of all the rose
Are broken wish the ground a speed [?]
It feels good
(It feels good)
(It feels good)
(It feels good to me without [?])

It feels good to me
