When you get tired
Of holding me tight
Remember it's our state of life
When we come down
Off our high for the night
You don't let go

And if you're feeling too close
Then we doing alright
Put you on my clothes
Take you out tonight
Take you out tonight

You're so skin tight
You're never close enough
You're so skin tight
Wrap me in your love
You're so skin tight

Nothing else sliding
Between you and me
What's in bionic?
We'll always be

Surrounding each other
For eternity
And we won't let go

So it gets a little hot
But the temperatures right
I'll take everything you got
'Cause you're always in my sight
Yeah, you're always in my sight

You're so skin tight
You're never close enough
You're so skin tight
Wrap me in your love

You're so skin tight
You fit me like a glove
You're so skin tight
You're never close enough

Anything less
And you'd be too far away
I can't feel it back
I can't feel it back
I can't feel it back

Skin tight
Fit me like a glove
Skin tight
Wrap me in your love

'Cause you're skin tight
Fit me like a glove
Skin tight
Wrap me in your love
