The world today is such a wicked thing
Fighting going on between the human race
People got to work just to earn their bread
While people just across the sea are counting the dead

A politician's job they say is very high
For he has to choose who's got to go and die
They can put a man on the moon quite easy
while people here on earth are dying of all diseases

A woman goes to work every day after day
She just goes to work just to earn her pay
Child sitting by but his life's much harder
he doesn't even know who is his father
