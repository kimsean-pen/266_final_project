It's a tragic point of view
It's pretty honest but it's fucked up too
I tried to run as far away from you
I keep it messy but I tell the truth

Dying laughter
Maybe I'm the fool

Don't think I'm human anymore
Feel soft as velvet, pretty pure
Don't try to help me find the cure
Don't wanna be human anymore

Curse the place where you were stung
It's just the way I think it should be done
The cuts are raw but better some then none
The ugly basicness of any one

Dying laughter
Maybe I'm the fool

Don't think I'm human anymore
Feel soft as velvet, pretty pure
Don't try to help me find the cure
Don't wanna be human anymore

Laugh away, laugh away, laugh away, laugh away
Pretty normal, pretty normal
Laugh away, laugh away, laugh away, laugh away
It's pretty pure, it's pretty pure

Laugh away, laugh away, laugh away, laugh away
Pretty normal, pretty normal
Laugh away, laugh away, laugh away, laugh away
It's pretty pure, it's pretty pure

Dying laughing
Maybe I'm the fool

Don't think I'm human anymore
Feel soft as velvet, pretty pure
Don't try to help me find the cure
Don't wanna be human anymore
