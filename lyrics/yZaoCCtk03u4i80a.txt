Just an ordinary day
Till you came around
I had my feet on the ground
So much for that
Just an ordinary day
Till you came around
And now my life's upside down
Imagine that
And it's all because I heard you say
And it's all because I heard you say
And it's all because I walked your way
And I heard you say, I heard you say
And I heard you say, I heard you say
And I heard you say, I heard you say
I heard you say, I heard you say
And I heard you say (hey, hey)
I heard you say (hey, hey)
And I heard you say (hey, hey)
and I heard you say (hey, hey)
And I heard you say (hey, hey)
I heard you say (hey, hey)
I heard you say (hey, hey)
Oh, I heard you say (hey, hey)
And I heard you say
And I heard you say
Oh, just right
You gotta sit tight
Close your eyes
And let your head go down
Let your feet up off the ground
And let your head go down
Let your feet up off the ground
Just an ordinary day
Till you came around
I had my head straight and sound
They've told me that
Just an ordinary day
Till you came around
And now my life's on the bounce
Just like that
And it's all because I walked your way
And it's all because I walked your way
And I should've known to stay away
And I heard you say, I heard you say
And I heard you say, I heard you say
And I heard you say, I heard you say
I heard you say, I heard you say
And I heard you say (hey, hey)
I heard you say (hey, hey)
And I heard you say (hey, hey)
and I heard you say (hey, hey)
And I heard you say (hey, hey)
I heard you say (hey, hey)
I heard you say (hey, hey)
Oh, I heard you say (hey, hey)
And I heard you say
