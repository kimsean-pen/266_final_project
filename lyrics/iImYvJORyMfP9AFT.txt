Maybe red's like roses?
Maybe it's the pool of blood
The innocents will lay in
When in the end you've failed to save them?
Their dying eyes
Are wide and white like snow
And now they know
The cost of trusting you's obliteration
Mirrors will shatter
Crushed by the weight of the world
The pillars collapse in shame
There'll be no rest
There'll be no love
There'll be no hero in the end
Who will rise above
And when it ends
The good will crawl
The shining light will sink in darkness
Victory for hate incarnate
Misery and pain for all
When it falls
