So many reasons why you live at night
There's no one to see you there's no one to talk to
You change with the seasons, so ired all the time
There's no use in dying if you've never been alive

Oh baby, running wild, have no place to fall
Except your heart
Oh baby, running wild, have no place to fall

Stand on your legs cause then your heart won't run on your sleeve
You always are cold there, you're always alone there
You go on and on about those things that you believe
There's no use in crying if you're jogging in the sea

Oh baby, running wild, got no place to go
Except your heart
Oh baby, running wild, got no place to go go go go

Oh baby, running wild, got no place to go
Except your heart
Oh baby, running wild, got no place to go go go go
