I've been running around, hey
I gotta slow down and spend time with my man
From city to city
Pleasing the world but neglecting him

Living on the road is so damn tough
Talking on the phone is never enough
I gotta get back to the place that I'm used to

And I feel like I need to be in the arms of my baby
And I gotta find my way back home to my baby now

I've been lacking affection
Craving for the touch of his gentle hands
So much love and devotion
No matter what I go through he understands

He sends me flowers but they don't compare
To how he runs his fingers through my hair
I gotta get back to the place that I'm used to

And I feel like I need to be in the arms of my baby
And I gotta find my way back home to my baby now

Feels like I need my baby now
Feels like I need my baby now
Feels like I need my baby now

Oh, I need him
Yes, I need him just to tell him that I love him, oh yeah

And I feel like I need to be in the arms of my baby
And I gotta find my way back home to my baby now

I need him in the morning
I need him at night
I need him twenty-four seven
In the arms of my baby now, ooh oh, oh
In the arms of my baby now, oh
