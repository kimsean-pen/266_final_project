It's how the story goes (It's how the story goes)
Down in Mexico (Down in Mexico)
Not that long ago (Not that long ago)
We were all alone (We were all alone)
And as my blood is filled with drinks (Blood is filled with drinks)
I'm wondering if you could be the one spending all my days
Now my head is filled with dreams (Head is filled with dreams)
But yours are only past 17 and our time is overstayed

Oh, no, away she goes, the way she knows
She's leaving me in afterglow, in afterglow
Oh, no, away she goes, the way she knows
She's leaving me in afterglow, in afterglow
Oh, oh no (No, no)
Oh, yeah

Yeah, the water's cold (Yeah, the water's cold, mm)
But her body's warm (But her body's warm)
But see, I told her no (See, I told her no)
But she's been here before (She took off her clothes)
And as we're dancing on the beach (Dancing on the beach)
I'm wondering if you could be the one spending all my days
We pretend these stupid things (Pretend these stupid things)
'Cause we just want to feel love and leave but our high is bound to fade

Oh, no, away she goes, the way she knows
She's leaving me in afterglow, in afterglow
Oh, no, away she goes, the way she knows
She's leaving me in afterglow, in afterglow

Oh, I think it's time I told her, these words about her
She knew from the first verse, the memories in Cabo
Away she goes, the way she knows
She's leaving me in afterglow, in afterglow

Baby, can I kick it with you (With you)
Again sometime? (Want to kick it with you)
We'll go back to that place, me and you
We'll dance all night
With my memories you sleep (Memories you sleep)
It's hard to picture your face now that I'm drifting out to sea

Oh, no, away she goes, the way she knows
She's leaving me in afterglow, in afterglow
Oh, no, away she goes, the way she knows
She's leaving me in afterglow, in afterglow

Oh, oh, I think it's time I told her, that these words about her
She knew from the first verse, the memories in Cabo
Away she goes, the way she knows
She's leaving me in afterglow, in afterglow

An afterglow
An afterglow, whoa
