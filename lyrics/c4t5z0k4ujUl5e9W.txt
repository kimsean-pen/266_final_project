A shot in the dark
A past, lost in space
And where do I start
The past, and the chase
You want to be gone
Like a wolf, a predator
I feel like a deer in the light

Your love be in that frozen time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with the she wolf
Who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes
Cause I'm falling to pieces

I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces

Did she lie and wait
Was obey to pull you in
The thrill of the kill
You feel, there's a sin
I lay with the wolfs
I know, it seems
I felt I was burned of you

Your love be in that frozen time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with the she wolf
Who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes
Cause I'm falling to pieces

I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces

I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
