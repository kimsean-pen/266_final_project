Another shot of whisky please bartender
Keep it coming 'til I don't remember at all

How bad it hurts when you're gone
Na Na Na
Turn the music up a little bit louder

Just gotta get past the midnight hour
Maybe tomorrow it won't
Be

This
Hard

Who am I kidding
I know what I'm missing
I
I had my heart set on you
But nothing else hurts like you do
Who knew that love was so cruel
Yeah yeah yeah
And I

Waited and waited so long
For someone who'll never come home
It's my fault to think you'll be true

Yeah yeah
I'm just a fool

Yeah
I said that I don't care
And walk away whatever
And I tell myself we were bad together
But that's just me trying to move on
With
Out

You
But who am I kidding
I know what I'm missing

I
I had my heart set on you
But nothing else hurts like you do
Who know that love was so cruel

Yeah yeah yeah
And I
Waited and waited so long

For someone who'll never come home
It's my fault to think you'll be true (yeah yeah)
I'm just a fool
For holding on to something that
Never ever gonna come back
I can't accept that it's lost
I should have let it go
Held my tongue
Kept my big mouth shut

Cause now everything's so wrong
Ooooh wrong
I'm just a fool
A fool for you
I'm just a fool
I had my heart set on you
But nothing else hurts like you do
Who knew that love was so cruel
Yeah yeah yeah
And I
Waited and waited so long
For someone who'll never come home
It's my fault to think you'll be true
Yeah yeah
I'm just a fool
I'm just a fool
I'm just a fool
It's my fault to think you'll be true
Yeah yeah yeah
I'm just a fool
