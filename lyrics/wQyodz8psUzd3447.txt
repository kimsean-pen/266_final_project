It appears to me
Quoting alarms
The guillotine smirks in
Your house I smothered

Sight unseen
Sworn to harm
Ground to a powder
And soaked through the board

Don't you ever, ever, ever trust my mercy?
Don't you ever, ever, ever trust my mercy?
When will you flirt with all that's burning?
Keep the safe and by your side

Of all that's left
A lucid home
Anecdote settles
In the smear of this corpse

If the larvae speaks
Ask where to go
They mount the maker
With a sulphur in fume

Don't you ever, ever, ever trust my mercy?
Don't you ever, ever, ever trust my mercy?
When will you flirt with all that's burning?
Keep the safe and by your side

Of all the warnings that you gave me
With all components in the fault
Have you ever heard me scraping?
It'll be hard to hold

Don't you ever, ever, ever trust my mercy?
Don't you ever, ever, ever trust my mercy?
When will you flirt with all that's burning?
Keep the safe and by your side

Of all the warnings that you gave me
With all components in the fault
Have you ever heard me scraping?
It'll be hard to hold

All I hear
Mending the gap
Fall in here
Might not make it back

Call that someone
May they hear you
Take me with you
It's not safe in here

And all you ask is "Why, why, why?"
And all you ask is why I'm certain you're holding on
Mirror floats to the surface
Holding on

Of all the warnings that you gave me
With all components in the fault
Have you ever heard me scraping?
It'll be hard to hold

Of all the warnings that you gave me
With all components in the fault
Have you ever heard me scraping?
It'll be hard to hold

They lost the presence they were holding
Looks like the tenants flickered off
If the cell that owns me breaks me
It'll be hard to hold.
