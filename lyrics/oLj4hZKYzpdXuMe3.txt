Don't you fear mistaken charms and loves that aren't
I fear near everything I've done by them
Don't you fear for something other than our health
I haven't learnt as much as I have lent
Don't you fear mistaken charms and loves that aren't
I fear near everything I've done by them
Don't you fear that getting there would leave you
With just not enough that you could start again
Don't you fear mistaken charms and loves that aren't
I fear near everything I've done by them
Don't you fear for something other than our health
I haven't learnt as much as I have lent

On account of dormant youth still here seemingly
I'll ignore books I've not read on what's left of me
Heather thick and looks of scorn show repeatedly
Reflection leaves something unmade but at least healthy
Drawing blinds across the light until evening's real
You can touch four walls in here while standing still

Don't you fear mistaken charms and loves that aren't
I fear near everything I've done by them
Don't you fear for something other than our health
I haven't learnt as much as I have lent
Don't you fear mistaken charms and loves that aren't
I fear near everything I've done by them
Don't you fear for something other than our health
I haven't learnt as much as I have lent
