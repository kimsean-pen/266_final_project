We had our life, we had our love
But you don't know what you've got till you lose it
Well that was then and this is now
And I want you back, how many times can I say I'm sorry
Yes I'm sorry

How can something so good go so bad
How can something so right go so wrong
I don't know, I don't have all the answers
And I want you back, how many times can I say I'm sorry

Well you know you can run and you can hide
But I'm not leaving unless you come with me
We've had our problems but I'm on your side
You're all that I need, please believe in me

I only wanted someone to love
But something happened on the way to heaven
It got a hold of me, and wouldn't let go
I want you back, how many times can I say I'm sorry
Yes I'm sorry

Well you know you can run and you can hide
But I'm not leaving unless you come with me
We've had our problems but I'm on your side
You're all that I need, please believe me

Well you know you can run and you can hide
But I'm not leaving until it's all over
We've had our problems but I'm on your side
You're all that I need, let me show you

They say you can't take it with you when you go
I don't believe it, taking what I've got or being here with you
You know I, I'd rather leave it

We had our life, we had our love
But you don't know what you've got till you loose it
Well that was then and this is now, and I want you back
How many times can I say I'm sorry
Yes I'm sorry
Well you know you can run and you can hide
But I'm not leaving unless you come with me
We've had our problems but I'm on your side
You're all that I need, please believe me

Well you know you can run and you can hide
But I'm not leaving until it's all over
We've had our problems but I'm on your side
You're all that I need, please believe me
