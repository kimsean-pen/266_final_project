He's goint to he concert
He's full of thrashing rage
He's going to rip his face off and throw it at the stage!

Headbanger Face Rip

She's putting on her makeup
She's teasing out her hair
She's going to rip her face off and throw it down the stairs

It doesn't really matter who you came to see to play
All we want to see you do is rip your face away
Thumbs into your eyeballs, stick your fingers in
Rake your hand across your face and pull apart your skin

Blood and hair swirl everywhere
Your face is gone but you don't care
Receiving thrills with every tear
Destroy it as fast you can
Now is your time to take a stand
Just rip your face off the band

Headbanger Face Rip

A sacrifice for metal, just throw it at the stage
Just raise your drinks
and silce your face off while the music plays

Headbanger Face Rip

Feel the rage control you; they'll never stop the shred
Just rip apart that ugly mug and bang it till your dead!

Blood and hair swirl everywhere
Your face is gone but you don't care
Receiving thrills with every tear
Destroy it as fast you can
Now is your time to take a stand
Just rip your face off the band

Feel the skin under your nails
Through the air your face will sial
It absolutely never fails
Now the crowds a bloody mess
their slamming harder then the rest
The band stomps all over their flesh

Headbanger Face Rip

Destroy it as fast you can
Now is your time to take a stand
Just rip your face off the band
