For some I'm the sun, I raise my son up into
To the light, the shimmering light
Flashes, flashes across the bay,
For some I'm the sun, I raise my son up into
To the light, the shimmering light
Flashes, flashes across the bay
People wait, they raise their son to the sun
It keeps us alive

You and I
Chasing the light
You and I
Chasing the light
You and I
Chasing the light
You and I
Chasing the light

For some I'm the sun, I raise my son up into
To the light, the shimmering light
Flashes, flashes across the bay,
For some I'm the sun, I raise my son up into
To the light, the shimmering light
Flashes, flashes across the bay
People wait, they raise their son to the sun
It keeps us alive

You and I
Chasing the light
You and I
Chasing the light
You and I
Chasing the light
You and I
Chasing the light

Think always, always so fleeting on light
They keep us alive, let's chase this light
Til it died, til it died

You and I
Chasing the light
You and I
Chasing the light
You and I
Chasing the light
You and I
Chasing the light
