You and I won't wait
And we'll grow up too late
With you in my arms, I can beat them down
And then I walk among the clouds

You and I will sway
High all through the day
And we are too young to lay down and die
We'll stick to our dreams to be safe and sound

Baby, I am all alone
Don't leave me now, you turn me on
I won't ever get it done
Don't leave me now, you turn me on
We are too young to lay down and die
We'll stick to our dreams to be safe and sound
