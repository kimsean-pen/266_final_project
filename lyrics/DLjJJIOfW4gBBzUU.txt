There are cracks in the wall
Giving me only slivers of the sun
I remember it all
Truths being told as soon as our minds were gone

Don't tell me there's no way your mind will change
Even the leaves grow weary of the trees from which they came
You can't hang onto something if it's gone and lost its color
So go find someplace warm I'll still be here when Winter's over

You always made my head spin
More than the whiskey on our lips
I just needed thicker skin
To help me loosen up my grip

Don't tell me there's no way your mind will change
Even the leaves grow weary of the trees from which they came
You can't hang onto something if it's gone and lost its color
So go find someplace warm I'll still be here when winter's over

Go find someplace warm I'll still be here when Winter's over
