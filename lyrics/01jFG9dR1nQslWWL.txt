Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I've got a picture in my head, in my head
It's me and you, we are in bed, we are in bed
You'll always be there when I call, when I call
You'll always be there most of all, all, all, all

This is not Hollywood, like I understood
Is not Hollywood, like, like, like
This is not Hollywood, like I understood
Is not Hollywood, like, like, like
Runaway, runaway, is there anybody there?
Runaway, runaway, is there anybody there?
Get away, get away, get away-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Get away, get away, get away-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, oohh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, oohh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I've got a picture in my room, in my room
I will return there I presume should be soon
The greatest irony of all, shoot the wall
It's not so glamorous at all, all, all, all

This is not Hollywood, like I understood
Is not Hollywood, like, like, like
This is not Hollywood, like I understood
Is not Hollywood, like, like, like
Runaway, runaway, is there anybody there?
Runaway, runaway, is there anybody there?
Get away, get away, get away-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Get away, get away, get away-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, oohh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, oohh-oh-oh-oh-oh
