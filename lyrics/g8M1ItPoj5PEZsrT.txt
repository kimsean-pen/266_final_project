(Boys, let's do it)

Bury me in love
Bury me in love

Shared your kisses, take your heart
Buried me and it hurts

I love my sister so
She don't smother me
I played the spades I know
I'm a Jack of all trades
Would you bury me?

Once you see her
One inside (hide, hide)
Some things you just can't hide
If you see her
Tell me why (hide, hide)
Why won't she come outside?

If you see her
Tell me why (hide, hide)
Why won't she come outside?
Once you see her
One inside (hide, hide)
Some things you just can't hide

She will bury me
She will bury me
