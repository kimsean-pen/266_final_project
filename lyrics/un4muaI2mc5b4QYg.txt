Do I close a window
In an empty bedroom?
I sat on a road and thought of you
Like a desert island, no sign of contact
My pure unrelenting solitude
What a way to go back, to a place familiar
Even though I have been here before
Can it be so common
Yet so peculiar, anymore

La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da, La-da-da-la-la-la

La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da, La-da-da-la-la-la

In my head I'm hearing
And I sing it softly
Theres as out of tune piano plays along
And I slowly slip back
For I'm only dreaming
Then I watch myself asleep under the sun
What a way to find out

Where my head has gone to
Or will the sweet taste of nighttime pull me in?
Will I wait forever
Or until whole life starts again?

La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da, La-da-da-la-la-la
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da, La-da-da-la-la-la
