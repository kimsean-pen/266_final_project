Try and get some rest
I'll do the rest
Think to what the roses find

With the arms of passion
This is how we fashion
Wars remind

In the hour I loved you
Like a dream it was true
In the base of my pine

Wilderness
Vast abyss
Will we ever kiss?

In her mother's fortress
She was brushing horses
Manes and tails, flicking flies

Naked as the window
Baby, if it's real so
No need to apologize

Wilderness
Vast abyss
Will we ever kiss?

Love is on her shoulder
Love is on the boulder
In the eyes, in the eyes

Love never leaves
Love is the leaves
In the sky, in the sky
