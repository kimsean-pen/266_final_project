Are you steady?
Are you alarmed that I am incomplete?

Are you ready for my soul?
What if I'm broken from the start?
And what if I never heal?
Are you ready for my soul?
What if I open up my heart?
And somehow we stumble into something real?

Are you aware of all that's underneath?
Are you steady?
Are you awake to what our love could be?

Are you ready for my soul?
What if I'm broken from the start?
And what if I never heal?
Are you ready for my soul?
What if I open up my heart?
And somehow we stumble into something real?

Are you ready for my soul?
What if I'm broken from the start?
