Do not, do not, do, do
Do not, do not, do, do

I remember how it started
Back at the end of May
It was such a lovely day
I was in a small café
I was in no way guarded
I let you come invade my space
Didn't know how much you'd take
Gave too much of myself away

You done really messed me up like that
Came and stole my heart, oh that's a fact
Boy, I think it's time I took it back
I don't wanna see you callin' me, asking where I'm at

This time, this time I won't hold the line
Been givin' you time that you do not deserve
No you're not mine, you just pretend to be
Don't need you tempting me with your alerts
Do not disturb
I'm putting myself on do not disturb

These ain't the words you wanted
I got nothing left to prove
Every time I let you ring
It's like I get déjà vu
I don't care what you promised
I don't care what you say, nah
Should've never let you in
That was my last mistake

You done really messed me up like that
Came and stole my heart, oh that's a fact
Boy, I think it's time I took it back
I don't wanna see you callin' me, asking where I'm at

This time, this time I won't hold the line
Been givin' you time that you do not deserve
No you're not mine, you just pretend to be
Don't need you tempting me with your alerts
Do not disturb
I'm putting myself on do not disturb

The sign on the door says
Do not, do not, do not disturb
Do not disturb, do not, do not, do not disturb
Won't give you time
You do not, do not, do not deserve
Don't wanna think about you
Don't wanna think about you

This time, this time I won't hold the line
Been giving you time that you do not deserve
No you're not mine, you just pretend to be
Boy are you getting me? Do not disturb

This time, this time I won't hold the line
Been giving you time that you do not deserve
No you're not mine, you just pretend to be
Don't need you tempting me with your alerts
Do not disturb
I'm putting myself on do not disturb

The sign on the door says do not disturb
I need you to stay gone
I don't wanna speak
Don't call me, don't text me
You are the reason I put myself on do not disturb
