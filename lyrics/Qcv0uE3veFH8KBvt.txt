I want you, (& I want you)
The right way (& the right way)
I want you (Yes I do)
But I want you to want me too (Want me too)
Want you to want me, baby (& I wanna it 2 be the right way)
Just like I want you

I give you all the love I want in return sweet darlin'
But half a love is all I feel
It's too bad, it's just too sad
You don't want me now
But I'm gonna change your mind
Someway, somehow, oh baby

I want you, the right way
I want you, dear
But I wan't you to want me, too
Want you to want me, baby
Just like I want you

This one way love is just a fantasy, oh sugar
To share is precious, pure and fair
Don't play with something you should cherish for life, oh baby
Don't you wanna care
Ain't it lonely out there

I want you, I want you, baby
I want you
But I wan't you to want me, too
I want to get down, baby with you!
Yeah! Darling! Ohhh, Oooo!
Get down, baby!
Have mercy!
Listen precious, I wanted you
For a long, long time
I wanted you
For so long
Oh baby, somehow

I want you the right way, baby
But want you to want me, too

Gotta, gotta, gotta
Love me sugar
The way, that I want you
