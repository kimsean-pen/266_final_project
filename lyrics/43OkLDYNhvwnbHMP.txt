These arms of mine
They are lonely
Lonely and feeling blue
These arms of mine
They are yearning
Yearning from wanting you

And if you
Would let them
Hold you

Oh how grateful I will be
These arms of mine
They are burning
Burning from wanting you
These arms of mine
They are wanting

Wanting to hold you
And if you
Would let them hold you

Ohh how grateful I will be
Come on, come on baby
Just be my little woman
Just be my lover Oh I need somebody,
(Somebody) To treat me right
(Ohh) I need your warm loving arms to hold me tight
And I need your tender lips too
Hold me, hold me
