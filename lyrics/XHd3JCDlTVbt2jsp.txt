I'd love to be feelin' nothing
I'd love to see you feelin' nothing
I can hypnotize you
I can hypnotize you
I can hypnotize you
I can hypnotize you
I can come figure you out
I can hypnotize you
I can hypnotize you
I can hypnotize you
I can hypnotize you
I can come figure you out

Treat me like a queen, always sticky, never fall apart
Swing the tambourine to the beat of my heart
Suckin' all the poison from a snakebite like a gummy drop
I'm just like a person with a hairspray heart

Face like a lemon
So juicy, confuse me
Out after midnight
You're crushin', I'm blushin'
Like a fuckin' diamond
Like a fuckin' diamond
Like a fuckin' diamond
Like a fuckin' diamond
Fallin' from my fuckin' eye
Like a fuckin' diamond
Like a fuckin' diamond
Like a fuckin' diamond
Like a fuckin' diamond
Fallin' from my fuckin' eye

Treat me like a queen, always sticky, never fall apart
Swing the tambourine to the beat of my heart
Suckin' all the poison from a snakebite like a gummy drop
I'm just like a person with a hairspray heart
