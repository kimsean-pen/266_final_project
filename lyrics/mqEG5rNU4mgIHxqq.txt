Out of the sky
The Floating Eye
Will prophecy and pretend
That this is the end

The people run,
Run to the hills
Run for their lives to flle
The horrible eye

This was the dream
Don't cross the streams
Jumbo machine
Can launch a rocket punch into the eye!

The giant robot with bird-like head
The giant robot he is our friend
Some chollos want to point the gun
but we've got the 3-2-1!

Fire!
Now we're talkin'
Fire!
Now we're talkin'
Fire Now we're talkin'
It's out of hand

Oh oh
When it's in my hands
We've got missle command
Oh oh
Bird head's working now

We're gonna watch it all fall down

Kaboom! Fall down
Kaboom! Fall down
Kaboom! Fall down
Kaboom! Fall down go boom

Jumbo machine
Shiny and clean
Who else can save the people
From the megaton punch?

Invincible
The guardian
Of careless men who
Run the world like a cartoon show

Living the dream
I hear the screams
Living the dream
To build my giant robot
With giant birdhead

Living the dream
Jumbo machine
Living the dreamS0
Shiny and clean
We can face reality and fight
