Boy you're so addictive
Got me shaking when you're gone
Claustrophobic when you're near
How did we get this room?
Like a roller coaster you come flying off the rails

Legs lit baby
You and me we don't see eye to eye
I could say it's all your fault
But half of it is mine
I'm clinging onto everything with my fingertips

No, I
Don't know how to behave
When you
Start screaming in my face
No, I just wanna ride this wave
I just wanna ride this wave
(Yeah)

We don't eat, no we don't sleep
'Cause all we do is fight
Mix me in the ring
And baby, let's call it a night
I'm running on empty
The step is a feral act

Loser hates to free our minds
I'm living in your head
Apologise and leave behind
Everything that we've done
I'm breaking down your walls, is all
Oh baby, won't you catch my fall?

No, I
Don't know how to behave
When you
Start screaming in my face
No, I just wanna ride this wave
I just wanna ride this wave

No, I
Don't know how to behave
When you
Start screaming in my face
No, I just wanna ride this wave
I Just wanna ride this wave
