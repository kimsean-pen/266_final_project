Your beliefs shadow everyday (Never again)
Live and breathe, shelter and restrain (Never again)

Never wanted loss
My ever needing soul
Never wanted blood...

You conceive tragedies innate (Feel so revived)
You redeem fallacy remains (Fear so in mind)

Never wanting loss
Never need control
Never wanting love

Could there be, something that your world depends on in me...

Never wanted loss
My ever needing soul
Never wanted blood...

Could there be, something that your world depends on in me...
Could it be, nothing that you learned from ash and debris?
