Until Sally I was never happy
I needed so much more
Rain clouds oh they used to chase me
Down they would pour
Join my tears
Allay my fears

Sent to me from heaven
Sally Cinnamon

You are my world
I pop pop pop blow blow bubble gum
You taste of Cherryade
There is something here you must show me

From what you are made
Sugar and spice

And all things nice
Sent to me from heaven
Sally Cinnamon

You are my world
you are my world
Your eyes are gazing back from
Every little piece of glass

You seem to smile from every place
Sally Cinnamon
You are my world
Then I put the letter back in
The place where it was found
In the pocket of a jacket
On a train in town
Sent to her from heaven
Sally Cinnamon
Your her world
