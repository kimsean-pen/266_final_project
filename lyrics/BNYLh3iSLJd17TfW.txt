Someone said to me, I'll come into your dream and speak it to you
I already knew
I found her in an attic where, dramatically, she leaned in to me
And she whispered these lines:
Wake and be fine. You've still got time to wake and be fine
Embracers meet with more embracers on the street
They say, "Hold me, dear stranger. Grab on to me
We're carrying our years around us, or they're chasing down us
We're all here at the same time. Can we wake and be fine?
Have we still got time to wake and be fine
Villians on the creep and killers in the
crowd are carving apart our childhood house
Lovers in their sheets,
dreaming lovers sweetly turn in their sleep all under sunbeams
Everybody's crashing, running,
calling out the coming of things they kind of can see
Someone said to me, "It's just a dream.
Why don't you wake up and you'll see, it's fine
In those miles racing over endless fields
of snow, you already heard, you already know
The rescue party finally lost their hearts
And then they shattered their bones, and then they died all alone
The ships all float from beaches by
themselves above the hot afternoons
Goodbye, you balloons! Adrift above indifferent clouds
Our hearts are crashing loudly on some rock where the gulls whine, to
Wake and be fine
Still have time to wake and be fine
Fine
Fine
