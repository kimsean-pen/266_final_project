There may be some but none like you
We'll be understood 'cause you're the truth
Give me a few more off to do
Call is conquering the love for you

I keep my eyes wide open so I
Can see there's a rain drop falling away
But if your words get suddenly blurred
You 'member that the truth is always worth, seeing

You're like a firebird in the sky
Shining for a challenger in the night
Just like a firebird is your heart
Keeps me warm and anchory in the stars
You're like a firebird
You're like a firebird

Courageous wings make things go far
Lingering solitude can rip them off
So let the wind cross your ash thoughts
Giving you the strength to carry on

I keep my eyes wide open so I
Can see there's a rain drop falling away
But if your words get suddenly blurred
You 'member that the truth is always worth, seeing

You're like a firebird in the sky
Shining for a challenger in the night
Just like a firebird is your heart
Keeps me warm and anchory in the stars
You're like a firebird
You're like a firebird
You're like a firebird
You're like a firebird

You're like
You're like
