Boy, you're going too fast
But I don't care 'bout that
I'm not the kind of girl you're used to
No need you too cool
I know you're old school
Just be yourself, and let me show you

I don't care, I'll take the raise
and you'll know what to do
It's all that, so that's nothing left to lose

You don't have to hold my hand,
(I don't need that kind of love)
You don't need to be my friend
(Making love is just enough)
If you want to be the man,
(You gotta turn my world around)
Take your time, and send that shiver down my spine
Oh oh oh oh oh ooh,
La la da da da
Oh oh oh oh oh ooh

Don't act politely,
Don't worry about me,
I want a love that's more exciting, oh oh oh
Don't have to be cool, I just wanna feel you
Stare through my eyes when you're beside me

I don't care, I'll take the raise
and you'll know what to do
It's all that, so that's nothing left to lose

You don't have to hold my hand,
(I don't need that kind of love)
You don't need to be my friend
(Making love is just enough)
If you want to be the man,
(You gotta turn my world around)
Take your time, and send that shiver down my spine

Forget the rings,
I don't need those things
Throw out the roof
No, no, no,
Don't complicate it
I'll demonstrate it
It's not about you, yeah

You don't have to hold my hand,
(I don't need that kind of love)
You don't need to be my friend
(Making love is just enough)
If you want to be the man,
(You gotta turn my world around)
Take your time, and send that shiver down my spine

Oh oh oh oh,
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
