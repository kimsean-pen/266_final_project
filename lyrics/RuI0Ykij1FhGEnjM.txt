I know I'm not the picture perfect vision made in your mind
I know I'm not the one you would've thought your love would look like
You're sifting through the pages of the book he left behind
But you can't find the reason when all the phrases realign

I tell it to you softly, it's so terrifying
When I hold you like a flower, I hold you like an hour glass
Hold you like you're the only thing I yearn

The feel seeps into dreaming, twisting circles round in my hand
It's harder to believe in all those awful things that they have said
But when I see the dust is falling, I don't want no one else
It's better to believe in something bigger than ourselves

I'll sing it to you softly, it's so terrifying
When I hold you like a flower, I hold you like an hour glass
I hold you like you're the only thing I love
When I hold you like a flower, I don't care how the hours pass
I hold you like it's the only thing I know

I hold you like you're the only thing I've ever had
I hold you like you're the only thing I've ever even had
I hold you like it's the only thing that would ever last
