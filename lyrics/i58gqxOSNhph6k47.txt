You don't need your name in bright lights
You're a rock star
And some thin foil with a glass pipe
Is your guitar, now yes it is
Little Angela suffers delusions
From these high times
She's been cleaning up,
Since she was fourteen
On the main line
And her hunky funky junky,
Of a boyfriend
Got her on late nights
With her skirt tight
Woah she's a wild thing, letting it all swing
God bless our high times
Don't you know that last night
Turned to daylight
And a minute became a day
Last night
All my troubles
Well they seemed so, so far away
Searching my reflection
For a glimpse of, an other me
I've got to get away from these high times
All these high high times
Cause these hight times
are killing me
Now high times go on
and on and on
High Times rock your mind yeah
This twisted crystal kingdom
Where you live your nine lives
And your head spins
With purple cyclones made of dexadrine
And when the phone rings
You think bad things
Well these are high high
High high times yeah
In any backstreet when you take a hot seat
Make sure you check your flight times
Oh now mama
Don't you know that last night
Turned to daylight
And a minute became a day
Last night
All my troubles
Well they seemed so, so far away
Searching my reflection
For a glimpse of, an other me
I've got to get away from these high times
All these high high times
Cause these hight times
are killing me
Now drop it this time
Paranoia will destroy ya
Paranoia will destroy ya
Paranoia will destroy ya
Paranoia
Paranoia
Don't you know that last night
Turned to daylight
And a minute became a day
Last night
All my troubles
Well they seemed so, so far away
Searching my reflection
For a glimpse of, an other me
I've got to get away from these high times
All these high high times
Cause these hight times
are killing me
La la la la la
High Times (oh yeah)
We're living in high high high times yeah
