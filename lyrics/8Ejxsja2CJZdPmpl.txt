What happened to dignity
Did it go away again?
Just like some worn out trend?
Will I still defend emotions?

What happened to honesty?
I don't see it on the Top Ten
I only see it in what has been
Cuz I still defend devotion
Am I alone?

Don't wanna rest
I don't wanna breathe
When I wanna hear about life
Don't wanna hear a spokesman
I don't wanna test
I want to believe
The god damn singer wrote the song
Don't wanna hear a spokesman

What happened to integrity
I don't see it on MTV
All I see is choreography
And I'll never be a dancer
What happened to puberty?
Bad skin and insecurity?
And who the fuck is Felicity?
Cuz I got problems of my own
Am I alone?

Don't wanna rest
I don't wanna breathe
When I wanna hear about life
Don't wanna hear a spokesman
I don't wanna test
I want to believe
The god damn singer wrote the song
Don't wanna hear a spokesman

Don't wanna rest
I don't wanna breathe
When I wanna hear about life
Don't wanna hear a spokesman
I don't wanna test
I want to believe
The god damn singer wrote the song
Don't wanna hear a spokesman

I don't wanna rest
And don't wanna breathe
When I wanna hear about life
Don't wanna hear a spokesman
