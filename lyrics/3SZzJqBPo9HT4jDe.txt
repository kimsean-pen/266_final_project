I see when you're down babe
When you're down
I got this place where I go to turn it around babe
Yeah, I turn it around

Can you feel it?
I'm drifting now down through the river that's made
Can you feel it? I can feel it
Yeah, I'm floating down I feel every ripple and wave
Can you feel it? I can feel it

You see when I'm down babe, when I'm down
You got this place where we go to
Turn it around babe, turn it around
Can you feel it?

I'm drifting now down through the river that's made
Can you feel it? I can feel it
Yeah, I'm floating down I feel every ripple and wave
Can you feel it? I can feel it

I'm drifting now down through the river
That's made for us we've paved
Yeah, I'm floating down I feel every
Ripple and wave through us to our cave

In this place getting lost all day
Yeah I'm driftin' now down
Feel your weight slowly drift away
Down through the river that's made

Can you feel it? I can feel it (that's made for us)
In this place getting lost all day (Yeah I'm floatin' down)
Feel your weight slowly drift away (Feel every ripple and)
Can you feel it? I can feel it
