A bullet in his head finally
Picking through the lead
Who knows?
Anxiety
So one more in his eye
And now I can breathe
Just push him off the ledge

One is nine
Nine is two
Holy God and holy truth
Nine is God
Nine to come
Nine to breathe inside your lungs

One is nine
Nine is two
Holy God and holy youth
Nine is God
Nine to come
Nine to feel
A bullet in my head finally
Picking through the lead
Who knew?
There's a side of me
So one more in my eye
And now I can see
Just push me off the ledge

One is nine
Nine is two
Holy God and holy truth
Nine is God
Nine to come
Nine to breathe inside your lungs

One is none
Nine is two
Holy God and holy youth
Nine is God
Nine to come
Nine to breathe inside your lungs

Your lungs
Your lungs
Your lungs
Your lungs
Your lungs
Your lungs
Your lungs
Your lungs
Your lungs
Your lungs
Your lungs
Your lungs
