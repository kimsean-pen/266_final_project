(Free Time) All right, all right, all right
(Free time) Everything's gonna be just fine
(Free time) Coming home to my baby tonight
(Free time) Finally gonna get to reunite

(Free Time) All right, all right, all right
(Free time) Hey yeah it'll be just fine
(Free time) Coming home to my baby tonight
(Free time) Finally gonna get to reunite

One good thing I can tell you
Oh I'm finally done
Playtime is over now
I can finally come home to my only one now

I've done left things behind, oh
Oh that always come and go
Not that little brown-eyed girl
'Cause I know I can see down in her little soul

Oh she says she love me all the time, yeah
Oh I cannot wait to come home to what is mine

(Free Time) All right, all right, all right
(Free time) Everything's gonna be just fine
(Free time) Coming home to my baby tonight
(Free time) Finally gonna get to reunite

(Free Time) All right, all right, all right
(Free time) Hey yeah it'll be just fine
(Free time) Coming home to my baby tonight
(Free time) Finally gonna get to reunite

When I walked inside that house my mouth dropped to the floor.
She said, "Hey, babe, I liked you gone, you don't come round here no more."
I said, "Hey, woman, what you talking about? My love for you has grown."
She said, "I've done a lot of thinkin', and I need some free time of my own."

(Free Time) All right, all right, all right
(Free time) What's a guy to take it now (?)
(Free time) I don't what my baby tonight
(Free time) What's it gotta take to reunite?

(Free Time) All right, all right, all right
(Free time) I don't know what my baby tonight
(Free time) Gonna make me cry tonight
(Free time) Because I don't know if you reunite.
