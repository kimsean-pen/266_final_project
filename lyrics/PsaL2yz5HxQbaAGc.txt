Go... ไรสราดดด
So fucking determined
Yeah, yeah go...
You better believe it, confidence
Go...
So fucking determined
Yeah, yeah go...
Spit out all reason
Yeah

I'm tired of holdin' up the weight
The weight of the motherfuckin' world.
All I want is just to get right here
Right now.
We struggle and fight just to get in a grave
That's overflowing
Clock's ticking on my fifteen minutes of fame

Come on now, one two three go
So fucking determined
Yeah, yeah go...
You better believe it, confidence
Go...
So fucking determined
Yeah, yeah go...
Spit out all reason

Yeah
I'm flushing the trust of everyone
Stabbing in the back and thinkin' they can break me
Set my sight can't die 'till I'm done, mind endurance
Never wanted anymore than what I deserve
Better bring it I'm taking it all
Fuck an inch 'cause I'm bringin' a mile
It's on now one two three go

So fucking determined
Yeah, yeah go...
You better believe it, confidence
Go...
So fucking determined
Yeah, yeah go...
Spit out all reason
Yeah

This fire
Is growing
Is burning
Deep inside of me.
Focused
Driven

Certain
The way it's got to be.
Fire.
Growing.

Burning.

Deep inside of me
Focused
Driven
Certain
The way it's got to be.
Crooked.
No trust.
Liars.

Conmen.
Drunk with
Power.
Mentor.
Taught me everything that I know...
So wrong
Wrong
Wrong
Wrong...
One two three GO...
So fucking determined
Yeah, yeah go...
You better believe it, confidence
Go...
So fucking determined
Yeah, yeah go...
Spit out all reason
Yeah
Go...
I'm fucking determined
Yeah, yeah go...
You better believe it, confidence
Go...
I'm fucking determined
Yeah, yeah go...
Spit out all reason
Yeah
