I know you remember
How the leaves fell in November
The cold wind of December
And how we just fell apart
I know you could hear me
But you pretend you don't have a heart
Then you took my halo

And you left me in the dark
I was hanging out the window
I was hoping I would fall
All the people were watching
As they were crying down below
And I can't get it out of my mind
I can't get it out of my mind
I can't get it out of my mind
In the shadows
I know you were clever
By sharing all your feathers
Bury all the treasure
But I won't play the part
One day you will hear me
Hunting in the dark
Taking back my halo
So this is where we part

I was hanging out the window
I was hoping I would fall
All the people were watching
As they were crying down below
And I can't get it out of my mind
I can't get it out of my mind
I can't get it out of my mind
In the shadows
As always the time haunts my mind, haunts my mind
To forget you
As always the time haunts my mind, haunts my mind
To forget you

I was hanging out the window

I was hoping I would fall
All the people were watching
As they were crying down below
And I can't get it out of my mind
I can't get it out of my mind
I can't get it out of my mind
In the shadows
Just like, just like cold days
Just like, just like cold days
Just like, just like cold days
