I don't know where to start
Now I'm walking the road of broken hearts
Yeah I know it was written in the stars
Now I'm falling, I'm falling apart

I don't know how to begin
The words seem to blow in the wind
All I know is that it's too late, too late
To fall in, fall in, fall in, fall in love

A hurricane will blow through everything I know
and take me away
Oh baby please save me from myself
and lift me to the state of euphoria

Tell me how, how to explain
When sounds seem to drown in the rain
I'm caught up, I'm caught up in chains
Now I'm calling, I'm calling out your name

I don't know when this ends
Cause reason and dreams seem to planned
I gotta go, I gotta keep on moving
Cause it's tearing, tearing, tearing, tearing me apart

A hurricane will blow through everything I know
and take me away
Oh baby please save me from myself
and lift me to the state of euphoria
Ohh
A hurricane will blow through everything I know
and take me away
Oh baby please save me from myself
and lift me to the state of euphoria.
