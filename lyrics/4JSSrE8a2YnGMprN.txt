Moving forward; moving faster

And every day, it grows
Forcing these scavengers to
Trail in its wake
Feeding upon the scraps
Of torn paper
And leftover change

Charging forward
We watch as it passes
Crushing everything in its path

Nothing can ever stop this campaign
Not when everything
In life revolves around this pain
The rich get richer
The poor get poorer
This monster moves

With no end in sight
This is what we created
With no end in sight

Creator of crime
Creator of deceit

After it passes, what will be left?
There's nothing getting better
Just worse and worse

Nothing can ever stop this campaign
Not when everything
In life revolves around this pain
The rich get richer
The poor get poorer
This monster moves

For those of you who
Contribute to its growth
You're only feeding this oil empire
Like throwing gas into this fire

Moving forward
