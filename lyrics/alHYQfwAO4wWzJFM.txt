Don't panic, no, not yet
I know I'm the one you want to forget
Cue all the love to leave my heart
It's time for me to fall apart
Now you're gone, but I'll be okay

Your hot whiskey eyes have fanned the flame
Maybe I'll burn a little brighter tonight
Let the fire breathe me back to life
Baby you were my picket fence
I miss missing you, now and then
Chlorine kissed, summer skin

I miss missing you, now and then
Sometimes before it gets better
The darkness gets bigger
The person that you'd take a bullet for is behind the trigger
Oh, we're fading fast
I miss missing you, now and then
Making eyes at this husk, around my heart
I see through you and we're sitting in the dark
So give me your filth, make it rough
Let me, let me, trash your love

I will sing to you everyday, if it will take away the pain
Oh, and I heard you've got it, got it so bad
'Cause I am the best you'll ever have
Baby you were my picket fence
I miss missing you, now and then

Chlorine kissed, summer skin
I miss missing you, now and then
Sometimes before it gets better
The darkness gets bigger

The person that you'd take a bullet for, is behind the trigger
Oh, we're fading fast
I miss missing you, now and then

Now and then...
Now and then...
Now and then...
You were my picket fence
I miss missing you, now and then
