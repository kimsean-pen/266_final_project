oohhh lets go
oh Girl you shining
Like a fifth avenue diamond
they dont like to use to
you never going out of style
oohh pretty baby this world might have gone crazy
the way you save who could blame me
when I just wanna make a smile

I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like prince
lets get it on like Marvin Gaye like hatherway
write a song for you like this

Your over my Haed
out of
