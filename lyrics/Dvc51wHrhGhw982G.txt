Revolution rock, it is a brand new rock
A bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock
Careful how you move Mac, you dig me in me back and I'm so pilled up that I rattle
I have got the sharpest knife, so I cut the biggest slice, I've got no time to do battle
Everybody smash up your seats and rock to this brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your ma, tell your pa everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
Gonna be alright
Revolution rock, I am in a state of shock
So bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock
Careful how you slide Clyde, all you did was glide, you poured your beer in me hat
Keep my good eye on the beat, living on fixation street, I ain't got no time for that
Everybody smash up your seats and rock to this brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your mamma, tell your pa everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
Gonna be alright
Revolution rock
Hey so get that cheese grater going against the grain
Wearing me down
Pressure inquiries
Everybody
Everybody smash up your seats and rock to this brand new beat
This here music mash up nations
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your mamma,? forget? your papa everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
It's gonna be alright
Revolution rock
To the coolest Mobsters in Kingstown
With the hardest eyes and the coolest tongue
Is your heart so made of rock that the blood must flow 'round the clock
Are you listening mobsters
Hey, all people crawl are gonna die
What carnal? booth? goes rolling by
It's food for thought mobsters
Young people shoot their days away
I've seen salad thrown away
Are you a loan shark?
The organ play and they're dancing to the brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your ma-ma-ma, tell your pa-pa-pa everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
Everything's gonna be alright
I say, "Revolution rocks"
