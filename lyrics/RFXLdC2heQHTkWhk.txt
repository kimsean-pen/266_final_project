I'm a ... if I go soft in their face
Just like the old days
Golden sea plane,
dollar to ...take
Been, what about again
At time I play the yellow night
Found ...from the beast

I'm just found my wings
Whoa, the rain promises
To give life to the seas, sea
Live, in the moment,
never count on longevity
Please

Ribbons showing, and they play... skin
Away... mean
It's so ... before left all my ...
Taste, my lovely space, taste
At time I play the yellow night

Found ...from the beast
I'm just found my wings
Whoa, the rain promises
To give life to the seas, sea
Live, in the moment,
never count on longevity Please.
