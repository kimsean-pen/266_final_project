Got your photograph
So faded now
Lose the last light
We were so close then
l felt the long day
When the streets have much to say
When l felt the waves
Light poured from your eyes
lt's all coming back
Feels like heaven
lf l hold it tight
l can make it real
l felt the long day
When the streets have much to say
When l felt the waves
Light poured from your eyes
