Winter snakes
Sleeping in the lobby
I better find a hobby
Or I'll be [?]
Sneaking out the courtroom
Just as the judge condemns you
Life is just a scary game
That we just don't want to play

Almost [?]

Don't you know
That it's all right
If we don't do something right
What is this
Heavy light overcoming me
Every night
Is it our fault
Zooming weekend
Zooming you
If you [?]
Take a bad lane

In the sun
Taken at [?]

Winter snakes
Do you know how
Many times you've seen it snow
Is it all
In your head
Pretty girl
In your bed
Maybe I
Don't deserve a
Single thing
Not promising
Anything
[?] Girl
Silver [?]
Broken work
A funeral
Sleeping still?
Are you dead?
Do you want to be?
Is that all that's left?
