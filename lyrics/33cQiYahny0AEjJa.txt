You love me, you love me, you don't
You love me, you love me, you don't
So you thought that you could have me
And spend some time with someone else
What it is that we're doing?
I fought for you for too long
You got me picking petals
You love me, you love me, you don't
And making baby metal
You love me, you love me, you don't
You won't, yeah I know
Cause all you ever wanted
From a girl like me, Was my energy
You won't, yeah I know
Cause all you ever wanted
From a girl like me, Was my energy
So you thought that you could have me
And spend some time with someone else
What it is that we're doing?
I fought for you for too long
You got me picking petals
You love me, you love me, you don't
And making baby metal
You love me, you love me, you don't
