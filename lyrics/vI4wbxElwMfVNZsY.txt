You can have a lolly pop
A candy bar a jelly bean
I'll buy you a rainbow
To hang above your door
It's pudding time
Laughter is a sweet
You can't put a price on
When laughter's all gone
Daddy won't buy you more
It's pudding time
It's pudding time children
Money money money
To buy you things
Daddy's gonna buy you
A diamond ring

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall
All the kings horses and all the kings men
Couldn't put Humpty together again.

San Francisco Bay
The Striped Bass are dying
But you're gonna get
That brand new bike
Oh joy
It's pudding time
It's pudding time children
