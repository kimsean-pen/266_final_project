It's one of those days
I don't do nothing
One of those days
To throw in the dustbin

Sittin' on my chair
I don't wanna see the sun
Why would I care?
Don't wanna see the sun

It's one of those days
One of those days
Oh
It's one of those days
One of those days
Oh

It's one of those
You lay down thinkin'
Just one of those days
Without an ending

Just locked in the air
I don't wanna see the sun
Why would I care?
I don't wanna see the sun

it's one of those days
I don't do nothing
One of those days
Without an ending

Locked in the air
Don't wanna see the sun
Why would I care?
Don't wanna see the sun
