Black hearted woman

Can't you see your poor man dyin'?

Can't count on both hands, baby
All the lonely nights I've been cryin'
Well I'm tired of all your slippery ways
I can't take your evil lyin'
Oh, no
Black hearted woman
Seems trouble and pain is all you crave

Black hearted woman
Seems trouble and pain is all you crave
Some time thinking I'll be much better
If I was stiff down in my grave
I just can't stay
Yeah
Yesterday I was your man
Now you don't know my name
Yesterday I was your man
Now you don't know my name
Well I'm going out to find a new way, baby
Oh, to get back into yourgame

One of these days
Gonna catch you with your back door man
One of these days, yeah
Gonna catch you with your back door man
I'll be moving on down the road, pretty baby
Ah, to start all overagain
Ah, yeah
