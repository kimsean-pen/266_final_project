Today I heard that someone left this earth
That someone disappeared left no mark here
Today I heard that someone just got up and left himself
Lying on the ground

Today is
Today is
Today is quiet in my town
Today is
Today is
Today is quiet in my town

Today two boys disappeared without noise
And I wish that I was them flying somewhere overhead
And tonight in silence, two lovers hate and find
One is bored
One is angry
But neither one of them is right, oh

Today is
Today is
Today is quiet in my town
Today is
Oh, Today is
Today is too quiet in my town

Today I heard the sound of birds and I wish that I was anywhere but here

It's too quiet, too quiet
It's too quiet, too quiet
It's too quiet In my town, in here, in here, in here
It's too quite in my town

Today is
Today is
Today is quiet in my town
Today is
Today is
Today is too quiet in my town

Today is
Today is
Today is quiet in my town
