You make that dance look so new
And I'm in awe
A face like you've never seen
I'm yours tonight
So come on
Light the stage
So we can all take off
Anywhere
We'll never come back
Ever

You wear that cast so cool
And I'm in awe
A face like you've never seen before
Around
So come on, yeah
Light the stage
So we can all take off
Anywhere
We'll never come back
Ever

Lie on the stage
You picture all of us everywhere
We'll never come back
Ever
