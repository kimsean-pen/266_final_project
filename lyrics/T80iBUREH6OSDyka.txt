You might think I would know better than this by now
That i should be strong enough to resist somehow
Even letting myself wish is a risk, I know
To let go and to kiss is just asking for the blow

You might think I would see clearer this time around
Now i'm done doing payments for your crimes, i'm done
Then again how can something this sublime be wrong
If you can't stand the fall then you better hold on

This is how it begins
With a smile
With an inch
Take a mile
Then again
What's another little sin?

If I walk through my whole life
Choosing the safe side
And staying smart (don't you know)
I'll miss out on the real thing
It's all or it's nothing
That's why it hurts (they go)
What good is an unbreakable heart?

I'm not try'nna tell you nothing 'bout right and wrong
It's a whisper and it's growing into a song
Are you looking for somewhere where you can belong
Won't you come on over here, we got something going on

This is how it begins
With a smile
With an inch
Take a mile
Then again
What's another little sin?

If I walk through my whole life
Choosing the safe side
And staying smart (don't you know)
I'll miss out on the real thing
It's all or it's nothing
That's why it hurts (they go)
What good is an unbreakable heart?

If I walk through my whole life
Choosing the safe side
Then what do you know? (what good is an unbreakable heart?)
I'll miss out on the real thing
It's all or it's nothing
There you go (what good is an unbreakable heart?)

If I walk through my whole life
Choosing the safe side
And staying smart (don't you know)
I'll miss out on the real thing
It's all or it's nothing
That's why it hurts (they go)
What good is an unbreakable heart?

Then again
What's another little sin?

If I walk through my whole life
Choosing the safe side
And staying smart (don't you know)
I'll miss out on the real thing
