So lets get our greetings and salutations out of the way right now

That we need to discuss right now
Is that okay with you, honey?

Now, I heard this is the best motherfucking club in all the land
Is that correct? (Uh-huh) Mm-hmm

Well, it better be
Because I never had no stunt shows or shenanigans at the doorway
Mr. Doorman, what's that? You need my I.D.?
This face is my I.D. motherfucker

Now, I'm not the kind of bitch who is going to go behind your back
And Talk Shit on you
If I have an issue with you, I will bring it right to your busted face
Now lets discuss it right now, shall we?
