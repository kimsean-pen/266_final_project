I got a question for you, I got a question for you
Where'd you get your name from?
Where'd you get your name from?
I got a question for you
Where do you see yourself in five minutes time?

With a laugh like that or a look like that
You make us all feel gauche like it's a smutty joke
But with a laugh like that or a move like that
You make us all just go, la, la, la, la

Woah, look out
You're what she came for
You're what she came for
No question, no doubt

Woah, look out
You're what she came for
Knows what she came for
No question, no doubt, woah

You're what she came for, oh

I got a question for you, another question for you
Do you feel the, do you feel the pressure?
Why you're wearing? What you're wearing?
Where will your life be gone in five minutes time?

So say something stupid
You know that you love to

Woah, look out
You're what she came for
You're what she came for
No question, no doubt

Woah, look out
You're what she came for
Knows what she came for
No question, no doubt, woah

You're what she came for, oh
You're what she came for, oh
You're what she came for, oh

You're what she came for
You're what she came for
You're what she came for
