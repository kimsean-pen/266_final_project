This is only a test

1, 2, what you gonna do?
3, 4, 5, twistin' your arm and your eye
You will buy

Step right up, donate a memory
To the bank of love, you loan your daydreams

Buy it!
Buy it!

Black Friday's come 'n gone

Buy me a future regret
A shrink wrapped fantasy that I'll wanna forget

In the age of the mercenary
In the nursing home, where river swallows the sea
That's where we'll be, with guns

Buy it!

Into the age of scrutiny
And the grandest frappe'
Well I ain't gonna pay
Trimming the tree, I can hang, I won't sway
It's only a test

Buy it!
From the Grandma's seat
Buy it!
From the children's graves
Buy it
Hear the angels sing

All the zombies walkin' Black Friday

It's a riot at the salad bar
Predatory lenders
Safari mission is far but you paid for them
To kill your mom

Buy it!
Kill 'em now!

This is only a test
