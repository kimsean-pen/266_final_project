Reality no longer battles perception
This letter's written to no one

Sincere, I sought your truth and divine purpose
Through myths of revelation
Guidance all wrapped up in a paper box
Supported only so long
As my mind was the enemy
I could not in conscience hold on

As we face distress we must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on, triumph awaits
As we face distress we must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on, triumph awaits us

The powerful constant that I had once leaned on
Is no longer there (no longer)
You call this shameful disbelief
A process like losing my closest friend

As we face distress we must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on, triumph awaits
As we face distress we must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on, triumph awaits us

Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart
Before we can rebuild them again
A greater foundation
We watch our whole lives
Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives (fall apart)
Before we can rebuild them again (rebuild them again)
A greater foundation

I wish there was another way
But no amount of devotion can fix this

Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits

Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart
Before we can rebuild them again (rebuild them again)
A greater foundation
(We watch our whole lives fall apart)
Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives (rebuild them again)
Before we can rebuild them again
A greater foundation
