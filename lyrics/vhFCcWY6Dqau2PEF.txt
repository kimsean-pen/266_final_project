Eleven years further on
The future's been and gone
Where to now?
We'll stand our ground somehow
Life under siege
For life out of tune

All things are meant to be
All souls that rise rise rise
Eternal conflict see
For fear of compromise
Life Under siege
For life out of tune

Bewildered and besieged
Confused and confirmed
For the man who works to be free
The only reality is
Life under siege
For life out of tune
