Have you seen?

Have you seen, the kite is in the tree?
And it? s towering over me
Germinating enemy
Have you seen, the branches are so lean?
And the air is in the trees
Animation in the leafs

All these silent moments
Of the years
Silent, moment
Of peace.

Have you seen, the kite is in the tree?
And it? s towering over me
Germinating enemy
(Tangled kite, almost running out of time)
Have you seen, the branches are so lean?
(Lamp post bright)
And the air is in the trees
(With orange lighting)
Animation in the leafs

I can? t see what? s up with this if I? m honest
I can? t see what? s up with this if I? m honest
I can? t see what? s up with this if I? m honest
I can? t see what? s up with this if I? m honest with you
If I? m honest with you

Have you seen, the branches are so lean?
And the air is in the trees
Animation in the leafs
