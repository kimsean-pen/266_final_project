Wild boys, wild boys, wild boys

Wild boys

The wild boys are calling on their way back from the fire
In August moon's surrender to a dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory, reckless and so hungered
On the razors edge you trail because there's murder
By the roadside in a sore afraid new world

They tried to break us, looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

You got sirens for a welcome, there's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing while you're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory, where is all you angels
Now the figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over secrets they could tell

They tried to tame you, looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

Wild boys, wild boys, wild boys
Wild boys, wild boys, wild boys

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always
Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always
Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always, wild boys
