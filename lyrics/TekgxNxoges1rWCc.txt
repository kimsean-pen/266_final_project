I've been thinking about you, babe
Every damn night, every day
Way I feel, it never change
So crazy thing to say

I've been in my head all day
Wondering if you, you might feel the same
What if we just ran away?
Don't look back, don't look away

Don't look back, don't look back
Don't look away, don't look away
Don't look back, don't look back
Don't look away, don't look away

I'm still thinking 'bout you, babe
Every damn night, every day
Never wanna take a break
Through the hard times, I will stay
And I know it's not a secret
Hard to wake up without a reason
Never will I ever hesitate, no
I just wanna show you what I'm made of
Somebody to hold down when it's cold out
Put your hair back, let the tears out
Wanna give you something that's new
And know it's always the proof
Ohh, take my word, one day there'll be wedding bells
I don't know what you heard, baby girl, I'm scared as hell
You could be like Bonnie and I could be like Clyde
Us against the world 'til the day we die

I've been in my head all day
Wondering if you, you might feel the same
What if we just ran away?
Don't look back, don't look away

Don't look back, don't look back
Don't look away, don't look away
Don't look back, don't look back
Don't look away, don't look away

I've been thinking about you, babe
Every damn night, every day
