Live life given now
Tomorrow can wait
Dance all through the night
Sleeping all day
Stuck inside a box
You gotta get out!
Stand up, get up
Live your life now come on!

Stand up, get up!
Come on, yeah yeah yeah!
Come on, come on!

Live life given now
Tomorrow can wait
Dance all through the night
Sleeping all day
Stuck inside a box
You gotta get out!
Stand up, get up
Live your life now come on!

Stand up, get up
Let's go right now!

People linning through this life we lead
Never knowing what we'll find out
So we living, working, and waiting for the day
There'll be something thats coming to take the pain away
And we wait for nothing inside your ways
You gotta let that fun girl through!

Sometimes it feels
How love indeed
And when just floating
Searching infinity (infinity x4)

Come on and dance here tonight
Tomorrow can wait
Dance all through the night
Sleeping through day
Stuck inside a box
You gotta get out!
Stand up, get up
Live your life now come on!
