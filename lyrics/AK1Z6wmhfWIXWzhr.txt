Baby I can fly like a bird
When you touch me with your eyes
Flying through the sky
I've never felt the same
But I am not a bird
And I am not a plane
I'm Superman
When you love me it's easy
I can do most anything
Watch me turn around
One wing up and one wing down
I never thought I would
Fall in love for good

I'm Superman
When you love me its easy

My sweet life has just begun
I'm in love each time, I know I'll have it,
Fell into my life so I grabbed it,
There's nothing I can do
When I'm with you

I'm Superman
Cause I knew it's easy
My sweet life has just begun
I'm in love each time and I know I'll have it
Fell into my life so I grabbed it
There's nothing I can do
Cause I'm with you
I'm Superman.
