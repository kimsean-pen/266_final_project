I'm looking for a hard headed woman
One who will take me for myself
And if I find my hard headed woman
I won't need nobody else, no, no, no

I'm looking for a hard headed woman, headed woman
One who will make me do my best
And if I find my hard headed woman
I know the rest of my life will be blessed, yes, yes, yes

I know a lot of fancy dancers
People who can glide you on a floor
They move so smooth but have no answers
When you ask, "Why'd you come here for?"
("I don't know")
"Why?"

I know many fine feathered friends
But their friendliness depends on how you do
They know many sure fired ways
To find out the one who pays and how you do

I'm looking for a hard headed woman
One who will make me feel so good
And if I find my hard headed woman
I know my life will be as it should, yes, yes, yes

I'm looking for a hard headed woman, headed woman
One who will make me do my best
And if I find my hard headed woman
