I spent it all
On the bag
On the drag
The sun comes up, the tide rolls out,
The trucks roll by the park, still a park
Where children play and pick up stones,
Anything to make them feel less alone - he's alone
His mind is his own town where his thoughts run aground
They fall all over and down
I spent it all
On the bag
On the drag
The sun comes down, the tide rolls back,
We crawl our way back to the house we call home
He holds his home in the palm of his hand
And he says, and he says
You are my everyone, you are my anyone
You are my anytime, you are my everytime,
You are my everywhere... anywhere...
