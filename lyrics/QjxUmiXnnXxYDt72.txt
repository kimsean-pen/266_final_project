No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf

Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you
For you, for you, for you

I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's just you I'm thinkin' of

Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner
In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care

Your kisses
Are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I don't stay out late
Got no place to go
I'm home about 8
Just me and my radio

Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' all my love for you

I don't stay out late
Got no place to go
I'm home about 8
Just me and my radio

Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you
