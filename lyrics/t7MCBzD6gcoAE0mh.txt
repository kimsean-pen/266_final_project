Phaedra shot it into the
Back of the newborn and
Phaedra let it fall to the earth
Like the billions

Phaedra, this apathy

Phaedra slipped into the
Gruel of the avians
Phaedra let it all come to pass
Phaedra let it all come to pass

The thought of mortality dormant in me

Phaedra slipped into the
Gruel of the Avians
Thought of mortality
Dormant in me

Phaedra let it all come to pass
Phaedra let it all come to pass

I let it mean a lot less and I
I let my vision vignette and eye
Old handsome death
His quiet house, where's there's nothing left to see

No god
No dawn
No need
The thought of mortality dormant in me

Phaedra it is you that I owe all my lackluster
The thought of dying is
Dormant in me
Phaedra it is you that made me

Phaedra it is you that made
Me want to kill myself
Phaedra it is you that
Owe all my lackluster

Phaedra this apathy

Phaedra slipped it into the
Gruel of the avians
Phaedra let it fall to the
Earth like the billions
Phaedra let it all come to pass
