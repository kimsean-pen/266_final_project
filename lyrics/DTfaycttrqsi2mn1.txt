I still look at you with eyes that want you
When you move, you make my oceans move too
If I hear my name, I will run your way
Can we say that we love each other
Can we play like there ain't no other
If I hear my name, I will run your way

It's my desire that you feed
You know just what I need
You got power
Power
You got power over me
I give my all now, can't you see
Why wont you set me free?
You got power
Power
You got power over me

I was lost until I find me in you
I saw a side of me that I was scared to
But now I hear my name and I'm running your way
All I feel is I get closer to you
It's that desire to move like you do
So now I hear my name and I'm running your way hey

(If you ready now)
(If you ready now)
(If you ready now)
I am ready now (If you ready now)
(If you ready now)
(If you ready now)
(If you ready now)
(If you ready now)

It's my desire that you feed
You know just what I need
You got power (power)
Power (power)
You got power over me
I give my all know, can't you see
Why wont you set me free?
You got power (power)
Power (power)
You got power over me

You're the one that seduced me
Lured me in with your beauty
Now I know that you used me
(I'm ready now)
(I'm ready now)
All you did was confuse me
You're not longer what I need
Touch me slow, feel my heart bleed
(I'm ready now)
I'm ready now
