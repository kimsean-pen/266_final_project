Sea water's flowing from the
Middle of my thighs
Wild buffalo are dancing on
Cliff tops in the skies

Adorn me in feathers from
Dead birds and
Contemplate the size
Of leather pelts to
Wind me in
Put shutters on my eyes

They'll cover the hills with their
Sweet flesh and soft nails
They'll cover the doors with the screams
That their minds dispose

Write it down, write it down, down
The names and dates of the daughters
Who bore out of me like
Grandmother's vines

They hang from the planks
Of my cedar grave grow
Pretty long lashes and beards
Guarding the rain of me from them
Heedless trampling toes
Gathering honeybees in their
Sockets and creases and holes

They'll cover the hills with their
Sweet flesh and soft nails
They'll cover the doors with the screams
That their minds dispose

They'll weave their long souls
Into the frame
To grow their foliage in
Sew their long hairs
Into their beds
To keep them crawlers out
To keep them crawlers out
To keep them crawlers out
To keep them crawlers out
Keep them crawlers out
Keep them crawlers out
