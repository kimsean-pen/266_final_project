She looks just like an angel
When she walks across the room
She shines tonight her golden light
Is everything I need

Lovers all around her
She wears them like her jewels
My friend said she's all he needs
To feel alive

Love songs on the radio
Your sweetheart lies in bed
She's dreaming of the things he said
She's hoping that it's meant
