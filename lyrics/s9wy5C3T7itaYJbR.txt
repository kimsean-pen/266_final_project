I'm wild inside, sick and tired
Didn't stay in line even thought I tried to be serious
Yeah I'm serious
I'm running blind in my mind
Looking for hides, it's my designes and it's dangerous
It's dangerous

I'm spinning, spinning, spinning
Wherever I go
I'm spinning, spinning, spinning
But you're the one that I know
When I'm right at the edge, hanging by a thread
There's always a compass
Beating here in my chest
Made love the mess, and I kinda love it
Cause I'm the worst and I'm you're zoo
I'm wearing scars like they're tattoos
But even when I'm spinning, my world's giving in
I follow that compass strait to you
Strait to you
I follow that compass strait to you
Strait to you

I follow that compass

I'm upside down, tripping out
GPS don't bring me out like you do, just like you do

I'm spinning, spinning, spinning
Wherever I go
I'm spinning, spinning, spinning
But you're the one that I know
When I'm right at the edge, hanging by a thread
There's always a compass
Beating here in my chest
Made love the mess, and I kinda love it
Cause I'm the worst and I'm you're zoo
I'm wearing scars like they're tattoos
But even when I'm spinning, my world's giving in
I follow that compass strait to you
Strait to you
I follow that compass strait to you
Strait to you
I follow that compass, I follow that compass
I follow that compass
I follow that compass
I follow that compass
I follow that compass strait to you
Oh no no no no, strait to you
I follow that compass strait to you
