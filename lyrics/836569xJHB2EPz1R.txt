And I thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better and I
Thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better and

Late at night, late at night, late at night I
Could have sworn that you were the right guy
Obviously not, now you're gone and
Holy fuck, how I was wrong

And you were spreading all those lies
My dear friend, how time flies
But it's nothing serious
Remember you told her that?
Guess word gets around
But I didn't countdown
I counted up instead
To when I got back my head

First month, I was so sad
Second month, a little mad
Third, a bit delirious
Fourth, I was so glad you left and
I got back my head
Guess that I grew up a bit
Forgot what I saw in you
And wish that I could press undo

Now you're not even my type
Funny what happens with time
And I heard all of the lies
And now I laugh

And I thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better and I
Thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better and

Late at night, late at night, late at night I
Could have sworn that you were the right guy
Obviously not, now you're gone and
Holy fuck, how I was wrong

And you were spreading all those lies
My dear friend, how time flies
But it's nothing serious
Remember you told her that?
Guess word gets around

And I thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better than than that

Thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better than than that
Thought you were better than than that
