You caught me in the middle dazed on the carpet
I was following the lines
that move like more snakes thinking...
Something ain't quite right

You got the devil on your side
standing to your right, come on!
You caught me in the middle dazed and confused
I was following the good steps

fancy free and footlose.
Something ain't quite right
You got the devil on your side
standing to your right, come on!

oh come on!
I get along, I get along, I get along, I get along...
Get along
It's coming out my ears

so baby here's what we'll do
There's four for you and nine for him
and six for her and I'm losing it now
Something ain't quite right
But if you get them on your side
then we'll have a good time, come on!
I get along, I get along, I get along, I get along...

Get along
I get along just singing my song
People tell me I'm wrong.
Fuck 'em!

It's coming out my ears
so baby here's what we'll do
There's four for you and nine for him
and six for her and I'm losing it now
Something ain't quite right
You got the devil on your side
standing to your right, come on!
I get along, I get along, I get along, I get along...
And when I do, I'm singing... get along!
