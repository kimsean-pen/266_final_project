I want to be outrageous
But inside I know I'm plain
So plain, just plain
Boring and plain

Silently obsessed with death
Just like anyone I guess
Tryin' for the perfect life
End up bein' in denial

I wanna be somebody
Wanna be somebody like you
Like you, like you, like you
Like you, instead of me

Silently obsessed with death
Just like anyone I guess
Tryin' for the perfect life
End up bein' in denial
