And now,
Eternity.

Be still now
I am with you
I am deep within you
You are at peace
You cannot be harmed
You will not suffer
Breathe deeply
Breathe in the healing love of the universe
And breathe out the sickness which has taken you
I am with you

It's easy
It's like breathing
It's like a heartbeat
It's easy

You have not betrayed your ideals
Your ideals betrayed you
What are you gonna do?

Your eyes will not close
Your tongue barely speaks
But I can still feel you

I can still feel you
So come, come relax,
Grin, let the changes in
Come on, come relax
Grin,

Let the laughter, let the laughter
Let the laughter begin
Well come on, relax,
Grin, let the changes in,
Relax, grin, let the changes in

Let the changes in
Come on, come on relax

Time is done
The sun has gone
It's too late
Eternity has come
