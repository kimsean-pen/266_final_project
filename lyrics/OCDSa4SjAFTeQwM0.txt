It's been a while since you noticed
I feel like you been losing focus
You lost the fire where the smoke is, uh-huh (Ooh)
Do you wanna get behind it?
Flip it over and recline it?
Undress me just the way I like it?
Uh-huh (Uh-huh)

I don't think you know what I been doing
And what I got on for you to take off

I don't think you notice, I don't think you care
I don't think you notice
So, what's the point of wearing
Nothing if you never notice?
The sex in the air
I don't think you notice
So, what's the point of wearing
Nothing if you never notice? (Notice)

Boy, I want you, but I'ma need to feed my sweet tooth
I can't help it, if it ain't you, uh-huh
Boy, open invitation, take me down
Now covered up in lace so, wait around, so, tell me, ah

I don't think you notice, I don't think you care
I don't think you notice
So, what's the point of wearing
Nothing if you never notice?
The sex in the air (Oh-oh-oh)
I don't think you notice
So, what's the point of wearing
Nothing if you never notice?

Tell me you don't (Don't)
Tell me you do (Do)
You notice?
So, what's the point of wearing
Nothing if you never notice?
Tell me you don't (Don't)
Tell me you do (Do, do, do, do)
Notice
So, what's the point of wearing
Nothing if you never notice?

I don't think you know what I been doing, oh
What I got on (Got on)
For you to take off (Ah)
Yeah, I'ma take off if you make me wait

I don't think you notice
I don't think you care (I don't think)
I don't think you notice
So, what's the point of wearing
Nothing if you never notice?
The sex in the air (No, no, no, I)
I don't think you notice (Uh-huh)
So, what's the point of wearing
Nothing if you never notice?

Tell me you don't (Tell me you don't)
Tell me you do (Tell me you do)
Notice, no, no, no, no, no
Tell me you don't (Tell me you don't)
Tell me you do (Tell me you do)
Notice (Tell me, tell me, tell me)
So, what's the point of wearing
Nothing if you never notice?

Notice me, notice me, notice me, notice, ooh
Notice me, notice me, notice me
Notice me, notice me, notice me, notice, ooh
Notice me, notice me, notice me
