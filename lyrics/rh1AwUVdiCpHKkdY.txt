To my dearest lover, I may never return home
There is a demon plaguing our lands and I must protect our home

Sickness is upon these lands, these mangled bodies in our hands
Behold a day of woe and sorrow
Together we await the storm
A demonic colossus, has death himself come to claim us
Our world has fallen to fade

The sickened disease of this human race has come and gone
I miss my friends and family
I feel so alone
The darkest days approach me, how long can I hold?
My will is fading but my chaos will unfold!

As I walk I can feel the pain
I go on, will I die in vain?
Is this the end of me?

Frozen in still figure, I stood in the gaze of
The beast that the legend has foretold of, this famine
His sickness consumes me
His eyes see right through me
Consuming my courage my fury unleashed

Its revolting appearance pales only in comparison
To its despicable cruelty done unto the innocent

Battered and broken as I lay so weak
Slaughtered in bloodbath, my will achieved
Smothered in victory, my odyssey
My heart turns black, as I become the beast

Purpose has spilt from me
I cannot live this life of disease
The abyss gaping beneath
I plummet away from suffering
