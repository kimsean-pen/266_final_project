(Chorus:)
Well it's the high anxiety
I'm a victim of society
High anxiety
I'm a victim of society
High anxiety it's my
It's my high anxiety
Getting to the best of me

Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna explode
When I'm approaching total overload
I know that when I'm having a panic attack
To duck and cover cuz I can feel it coming

(Chorus)

This time I feel like I'm gonna die
Cold sweat the fear is paralyzing
You know I wish that this was over and done
Heart pounds I can feel it escalating

(Chorus)

I don't know why
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night
I don't know why I gasp for breath
I'm really feeling like I'm on the brink of death

I wish I could get this crisis under control
Then I could feel some kind of closure
I feel this could go on and on without end
I guess I'll just have to ride it out cuz

(Chorus 2x)
