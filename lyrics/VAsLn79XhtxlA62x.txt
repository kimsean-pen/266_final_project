Cosmoman vibration gig-ê
Cosmoman vibration gig-ô
Bolo cosmoman, bolo cosmoman
Cosmoman bolo
Pushing boundaries
I spy with my glassy eyes
A turning point to my whole life
Rising in these palm trees
That's me
Wearing trunks in December
Writing to remember
Leaking on the roadside
Minding the steps, minding the crap
Praying for my good angel
Praying for my know-how
Planning my costumes for the next carnival
That's my heart
Distressed and colorful
A burning shuttle in the deep blue
A sparkling water swimming pool

Cosmoman vibration gig-ê
Cosmoman vibration gig-ô
Bolo cosmoman, bolo cosmoman
Cosmoman bolo
