We were lovers for some time
We went separate ways that's fine
But I can't sit idly by

I've seen you hand in hand with him
Derrick is a man of whim
He will surely see you cry

I don't want to come between
I don't want to ruin your love
But Derrick is a strange machine

I don't want to be obscene
I don't want to tell what he's done
But Derrick is a loaded gun

He can be so very cruel
He has but a single rule
A cold and heartless point of view

You should have a better care
And put an end to this affair
Derrick's always been bad news

I don't want to come between
I don't want to ruin your love
But Derrick is a strange machine

I don't want to be obscene
I don't want to tell what he's done
But Derrick is a loaded gun

We were lovers for some time
We were lovers for some time

I don't want to come between
I don't want to ruin your love
But Derrick is a strange machine

I don't want to be obscene
I don't want to tell what he's done
But Derrick is a loaded gun

We were lovers for some time
