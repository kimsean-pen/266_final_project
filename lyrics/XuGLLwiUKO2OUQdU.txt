My heart is hardly hurt by her lack
And I'm on my way to save the world by our chance
And I'm falling when the water moves right through
And I'll Call For You when I, when I keep on, keep on, keep on

My years are only hurt, my heart still
My fear is set behind, I kill
And I'm falling when the water moves right through
And I'll Call For You when I, when I keep on, keep on, keep on

Will you keep me looking for that old love?
Looking for the old love, looking for me?
Will you keep me looking for that old love?
Looking for the old love, looking for me?

Will you keep me looking for that old love?
Looking for the old love, looking for me?
And I'm falling when the water moves right through
And II'll Call For You when I, when I keep on, keep on, keep on

And I'm falling when the water moves right through
And I'll Call For You when I, when I keep on, keep on, keep on
