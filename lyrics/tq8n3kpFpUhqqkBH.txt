Life!

Things keep ending up this way
Another notch is carved away
Hearing the thoughts of mass decay
Funny how things end up this way

Beaten down, dominated by its sound
Growing deep within my head
Softly dying, its soul is shed
Eating me all up inside
This cancer finds everything I hide
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

Life!
That's not right out insane

Satisfaction is delayed
Its motivation is displayed
Finding its misogyny
Funny how I die and go away

Beaten down, dominated by its sound
Growing deep within my head
Softly dying, its soul is shed
Eating me all up inside
This cancer finds everything I hide
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

Life!
That's not right out insane

I'm constantly beat up inside, and I'm the one to blame
No one can relate to me that's not right out insane

That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane

Beaten down, dominated by its sound
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

Beaten down, dominated by its sound
Growing deep within my head
Softly dying, its soul is shed
Eating me all up inside
This cancer finds everything I hide
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

Life!
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane!
