Maybe one day i'll be an honest man
Up till now i'm doing the best i can
Long roads, long days, of sunrise to sunset
Sunrise to sunset
Dream on brothers, while you can
Dream on sister, i hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of time
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night
Dream on brothers, while you can
Dream on sisters, i hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of time
Sands are flowing and the lines
Are in your hand
In your eyes i see the hunger, and Desperate cry that tears the night
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night
