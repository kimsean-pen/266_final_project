Well now listen up
Well she's razor sharp
If she don't get her way
Well she'll slice you apart

Now she's a cool, cool black
And she moves like a cat
If you don't get her way
Well you might not make it back

She's got the looks that kill
That kill, that kill
She's got the looks that kill
That kill, that kill
She's got the look

She's got the looks that kill
She's got the looks that kill

Well she's bulletproof
She keeps her motor clean
Well would you believe me, you
She's a number thirteen

Well the church strikes midnight
She's lookin' louder and louder
She's gotta turn on the juice, boy
Well then she turns on the power

She's got the looks that kill
That kill, that kill
She's got the looks that kill
That kill, that kill
She's got the look

Well now listen up
Well she's razor sharp
If she don't get her way
Well she'll slice you apart

Now she's a cool, cool black
And she moves like a cat
If you don't get her game
Well you might not make it back

She's got the looks that kill
That kill, that kill
She's got the looks that kill
That kill, that kill
She's got the look

She's got the looks that kill
She's got the looks that kill
She's got the looks that kill
She's got the looks that kill

She's got the looks that kill
She's got the looks that kill
She's got the looks that kill
She's got the looks that kill
She's got the looks that kill
She's got the looks that kill
She's got the looks that kill
She's got the looks that kill
She's got the looks that kill
She's got the looks that kill
She got the looks that kill
She got the looks that kill
She got the looks that kill
