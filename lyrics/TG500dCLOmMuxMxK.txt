There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
All over the world you can
Hear the sound of lovers in love
You know what I mean

Just the two of us and nobody else
In sight there's nobody else and
I'm feeling good just holding you tight

So listen very carefully
Get closer now and
You will see what I mean
It isn't a dream

The only sound that you will hear
Is when I whisper in your ear
I love you forever and ever

There's a kind of hush
All over the world, tonight
All over the world, people
Just like us have fallen in love

So listen very carefully
Get closer now and
You will see what I mean
It isn't a dream

The only sound that you will hear
Is when I whisper in your ear
I love you forever and ever

There's a kind of hush
All over the world, tonight
All over the world, people
You can hear the sounds of lovers in love
