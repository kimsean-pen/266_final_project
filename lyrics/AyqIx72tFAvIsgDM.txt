Get the new york look
Get the paris chic
Rimmel london on my lips
Clothes dangle like a sheet
Get the milan look
Collar bones like knives
Ribcage like scaffolding from a building site
(Traces of yesterday run down your face)

Dying to be thin
Dieting to fit in
Dying to feel alive
Dying from the inside out
Dying to be thin
Starving to be extra trim
Dying to feel alive
Dying from the inside out

The inside out
The inside out
The inside out
The inside out
How far can you walk
With bones so weak and thin
Looking for an sos
But don't know where to begin

You say there's nothing wrong
But under t-shirts you hide
Once there's no more flesh to shed, you'll fade away inside
(Stuck in a cycle that you can't escape)
Dying to be thin
Dieting to fit in
Dying to feel alive
Dying from the inside out

Dying to be thin
Starving to be extra trim
Dying to feel alive
Dying from the inside out

The inside out
The inside out
The inside out
The inside out
Ohhh... find me another skin... To live within.
