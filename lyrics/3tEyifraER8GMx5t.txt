It's never easy, being told,
you're not enough, you don't fit this mold,
that inner feeling, no sugar coating that,
it'll knock you down, flat on your back
Oh no no no this isn't some little love song
Or a cold shoulder, dear, for your tears to freeze on
It hurts to lose something you once had had,
but take a good look around at all the good things you still have

'Cause there will be another
There will be another one
Something new to fall into
It will be a better one.
There will be another
There will be another one
Someone you will hold onto
There will be a better one

Good things will happen, bad ones will too
So remember that, as they happen to you
Oh no no no this isn't some little sad song
Or a cold shoulder, dear, for your tears to freeze on
It hurts to lose something you can't have back,
but take a good look around at all the good things you still have

'Cause there will be another
There will be another one
Something new to fall into
It will be a better one.
There will be another
There will be another one
Someone you can hold onto
There will be a better one

' Cause there will be another
There will be another one
Something new to fall into
It'll be a better one
There will be another
There will be another one
Something new to hold onto
And there'll be a better one
There will be another
There will be another one
There will be another one
Oooh there will be another one
Right around the corner son
It'll be another one
There will be a better one.
