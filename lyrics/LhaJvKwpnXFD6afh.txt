The day we met it was clear to see
You were thinking you're better than me
How could a boy think just like this?
No matter what, I can't understand

The day you stole my happiness
All the details... I can't forget
Your dirty money is always you've got
And an education that creates monsters

So please keep in mind that we're made
Of the same stuffs
So please keep in mind that we're the same
But our values are different

Hey!
You made me hate the simple things of life
Hey!
You're my enemy and this is why
Hey!
2013 Will be forever the year
I almost stopped to believe

I almost stopped to believe
I almost stopped to believe
I almost stopped to believe
