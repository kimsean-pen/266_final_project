In the beginning a song created thirst
Concluding a microphone formula giving earth
A flutter inside, that's coming alive
I'm absorbing external violence
I'm jagged by an effort to please my audience
Approaching in here, I'm choking

I'm getting used to closing eyes everywhere
'Cause I'm beginning to stray the skies everywhere

I am silent but breathing heavily
I try to make sense of my skins complexity
My muse is designed to alter your mind
I am moving before this avalanche
That's constantly pushing me into consequence
It's floating in here, we're choking

This sound is unbearable, aching
My captain in dissonance loosing ground
Few are the divers having air enough to never drown
