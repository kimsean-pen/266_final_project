(Verse)
I don't feel sorry for the things that I have done
I won't be blaming everything is going wrong.
And now you said it and you're finally feeling strong.
But what I told you was the truth I'm all along.

And in my head I know I finally found a way
But now my time is off and I have no mistake.
I'm beating my head on my hands
Beating my head on my hands.

I don't feel sorry for the things that I have done
I won't be blaming everything is going wrong.

Beating my head on my hands
Beating my head on my hands
Beating my head on my hands.
