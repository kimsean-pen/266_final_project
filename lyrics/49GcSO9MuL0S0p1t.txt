Pilgrim, those are dry and bitter tears and lonely
Eyes that look way beyond your years
Pilgrim, did you drink the mercury?
Your lips turned blue and you're struggling just to see,
You were too far gone to carry on, now your life has stalled,
As you march ahead yet go no place at all.

Pilgrim, when you left them all behind
The loneliness destroyed your able mind,
Pilgrim, see the writing on the door?
It's taking you back to a place you were before

And the next in line paces your stride waiting for your fall,
With a hope that lies in a hidden master's call

Pious eyes ignoring passers by
Headlong to their grave
Don't despair this world of toil and care.
This pilgrim lost his way

Pilgrim will you ever find your call?
Is truth so pure that you're willing to risk it all?

Pious eyes ignoring passers by
Headlong to their grave
Don't despair this world of toil and care.
This pilgrim lost his way
