The neck, and then the chain
The head is hung in shame
The neck, and then the chain
The head is hung in shame

I thought that you had grown
That you'd carry on
But now that I am gone
What else's been withdrawn

You used to be like my twin
And all its been
Was it all for nothing
Are you strong when you're with him
The one who's placed you above us all

I think our love
I'll let it pass
It feels like fire
But it won't last

What is this coming to
