Hit the ground
Hit the ground running

It's a oneway street
With an open end
And you never know
What lies ahead

But I always knew
That this was it
The signs were lit
Oh I always knew

I'm gonna hit the ground running
Hit the ground running
Only waiting for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the morning comes

I'm gonna hit the ground running
Hit the ground running
Only waiting for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the morning comes

I'm an overdrive
Go to play offense
And I won't look back
There be no regrets

I keep my head up
Even if I'm fed up
Cause I'm getting closer
Oh I know, oh I know

I'm gonna hit the ground running
Hit the ground running
Only waiting for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the morning comes

I'm gonna hit the ground running
Hit the ground running
Only waiting for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the morning comes

I'll be ready when the morning comes
Only waiting for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the morning comes

It's a oneway street
With an open end
And you never know
What lies ahead

But I always knew
That this was it
The signs were lit
Oh I always knew

I'm gonna hit the ground running
Hit the ground running
Only waiting for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the morning comes

I'm gonna hit the ground running
Hit the ground running
Only waiting for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the morning comes

I'm gonna hit the ground running
Hit the ground running
Only waiting for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the morning comes

I'm gonna hit the ground running
Hit the ground running
Only waiting for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the morning comes
