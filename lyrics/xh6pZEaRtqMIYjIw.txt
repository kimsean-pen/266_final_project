I wake up in the dark of night (Tell me how does it feel?)
Do you ever think about me? (Do I need to be?)
You're sleeping alone tonight (Tonight, right here)
How does it feel, what do you think?
Are you happy?

Faith in everything
Faith in what you need
Faith in everything
Now
Pain in everything you know

I wake up with the stars at night
Tell me what you feel
And I cannot feel you by me
It didn't need to be
You sleep alone tonight (Glory and I hear)
How does it feel, what do you think?
Do you still hate me?
