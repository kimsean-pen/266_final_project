I got no friends
Only people that I know
They seems so nice to me
And I?

Looking out the window
At the place I want to go
I thought if I stay here
My head will explode

I ain't fit to live here
Among the people of my time
No I ain't fit for nothing
Just wanna leave the world behind
If I don't get my head straight
I'll never chase them here again
But if they try to push me
I won't make it here alive

Outside the rain is pouring
The time is passing by
I'm thinking of the passed weeks
But my memory is blind
Someone?
Then I never would've come
But why should I bother?

I ain't fit to live here
Among the people of my time
No I ain't fit for nothing
Just wanna leave world behind
If I don't get my head straight
I'll never chase them here again
But if try to push me
I won't make it here alive

People ask me what is wrong,
I don't see what's right,
Can't get my thoughts together,
I'm still asking why,
Random days keep passing by,
Don't makeï¿ sense to me,
I'll stop myself from leaving,
'cause I know where it will lead,
I know where it will lead,
I know where it will lead,
Cause know where it will lead.

Why? ghost
For me to? dead
Like the cat who caught the rabbit?

I ain't fit to live here
Among the people of my time
No I ain't fit for nothing
Just wanna leave world behind
If I don't get my head straight
I'll never chase them here again
But if try to push me
I won't make it here alive
