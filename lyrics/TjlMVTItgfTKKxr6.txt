Our best laid plans are all we ever have
My mind is fading, time is wasting
Lately I can't remember who I am
Come close and tell me I'm not crazy
Losing all track of sleep tonight I don't wanna let you down
Something with me just isn't right and I can't make it out
Who I am right now?

So when I stay it is never long, keep calling when I need it
Tell me where does the mind go when the lights turn low?
I'm takin' by some unholy ghost, I know you don't believe it
Tell me where does the mind go when the lights turn low?

And I can feel these walls are closing in
Oh where have I been, maybe I have just been dreaming
Losing all track of sleep tonight I don't wanna let you down
Something with me just isn't right and I can't make it out
I think you wouldn't recognize the man that I am right now
Something with me just isn't right and I can't make it out
Who I am right now?

So when I stay it is never long, keep calling when I need it
Tell me where does the mind go when the lights turn low?
I'm takin' by some unholy ghost, I know you don't believe it
Tell me where does the mind go when the lights turn low?

So when I stay it is never long, keep calling when I need it
Tell me where does the mind go when the lights turn low?

I'm takin' by some unholy ghost, I know you don't believe it
Tell me where does the mind go when the lights turn low?
When the lights turn low
When the lights turn low
