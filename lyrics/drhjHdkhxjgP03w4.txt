Every morning when you come downstairs
There's a mess but I don't care
No makeup on and shining so bright
My old sweatshirt never fit so right
Dancing around to the radio
Humming the words that you don't know
Cause I'm finding an angel off my list
Thinking that it don't get no better than this

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every little touch
Reminds me how just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

Wrapped around me late at night
Pillow talk by candle light
Gonna slow this down and make it last
The best things fly by us so fast

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every little touch
Reminds me how just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

Oh, I wanna sing it again

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every little touch
Reminds me how just how much it all makes
Loving you easy
