They saw you today as you were leaving
And they run to hunt you down
Dogs lead the chase as you are bleeding
They run to hunt you down

Your narrow escape
Has wiped the smile right from your face
Those starved dogs howling
Run to hunt you down

You smile as you look in the mirror
Tears have left your eyes
Your face has a different exterior
Permanent disguise

Your narrow escape
Has wiped the smile right from your face
Those starved dogs howling
Run to hunt you down
I said run just to hunt you down
Right now, right now, right now, right now
