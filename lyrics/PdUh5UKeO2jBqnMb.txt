So what am I fighting for?
Everything back and more
And I'm not gonna let this go
I'm ready to settle the score
Get ready 'cause this is war

There are days that I think I'm crazy
Other days nothing seems to phase me
There's nothing more and nothing less just
All the fears that I must confess, well
I'm afraid I believe in nothing
No hopes or dreams, you could've left me dead
Naive and not to mention I'm
Losing count of all my blessings

With all that I've done, it's too late
I can't take back all that I have become

So all that I'm trying to say
I'm looking for a better way
But some days it just gets so hard
And I don't wanna slip away
So what am I fighting for?
Everything back and more
And I'm not gonna let this go
I'm ready to settle the score
Get ready 'cause this is war

Another day in the right direction
I'm ok, but I'm left to question
How did I get so far behind the rest?
Why am I so inclined to forget?
All the days that you made me crazy
Nowadays you don't even phase me
It's all the same and I don't stress none
Sick and tired of all this tension

With all that I've done, it's too late
I can't take back all that I have become

So all that I'm trying to say
I'm looking for a better way
But some days it just gets so hard
And I don't wannna slip away
So what am I fighting for?
Everything back and more
And I'm not gonna let this go
I'm ready to settle the score
Get ready 'cause this is war

Get ready 'cause this is war
Get ready 'cause this is war

All that I'm trying to say
I'm looking for a better way
But some days it just gets so hard
And I don't wanna slip away
So what am I fighting for?
Everything back and more
And I'm not gonna let this go
I'm ready to settle the score
Get ready 'cause this is war

(I'm looking for a better way)
(Some days it just gets so hard)
(And I don't want to slip away)
Get ready 'cause this is war
(Everything back and more)
(And I'm not gonna let this go)
(I'm ready to settle the score)
Get ready 'cause this is war
