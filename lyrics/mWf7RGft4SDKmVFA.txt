I think my friend said, "I hear footsteps"
I wore my black and white dress to the
Birthday massacre, birthday massacre, birthday
I wore my black and white dress

I think my friend said, "Stick it in the back of her head"
I think my friend said, "Two of them are sisters"
"I'm a murder tramp, birthday boy," I think I said
"I'm gonna bash them in, bash them in," I think he said

Then we wished them all a happy birthday
We kissed them all goodnight.
Now he chases me to my room,
Chases me to my room,
Chases me...
In my black and red dress

I think my friend said, "Don't forget the video"
I think my friend said, "Don't forget to smile"
"You're a murder tramp, murder tramp," I think he said
"You're a murder boy, birthday boy," I think I said

I think my friend said, "Stick it in the back of her head"
I think my friend said, "Two of them are sisters"
"I'm a murder tramp, birthday boy," I think I said
"I'm gonna bash them in, bash them in," I think he said
I think my friend said, "Don't forget the video"
I think my friend said, "Don't forget to smile"
"You're a murder tramp, murder tramp," I think he said
"You're a murder boy, birthday boy," I think I said
