Ever and ever, forever and ever you'll be the one
that shines in me like the morning sun
Ever and ever, forever and ever you'll be my spring
my rainbow's end and the song I sing

Take me far beyond imagination
You're my dream come true, my consolation

Ever and ever, forever and ever you'll be my dream
my symphony, my own lover's theme
Ever and ever, forever and ever my destiny
will follow you eternally

Take me far beyond imagination
You're my dream come true, my consolation

Ever and ever, forever and ever you'll be the one
that shines in me like the morning sun
Ever and ever, forever and ever my destiny
will follow you eternally
