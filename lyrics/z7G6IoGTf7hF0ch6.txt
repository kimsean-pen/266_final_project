My mind is in a state
'Cuz all I seem to do is tempt my fate
Well, I try a real space
But all the while, I'm crashin' up the gate

This time, this time
Reality struck me between the eyes

My mind is in a state
'Cuz everything I'm missing comes too late
So I try and disappear
But there is only one way out of here

This time, this time
Reality struck me between the eyes

My mind is in a state
But all I need to do is change my pace
And I know there's fear to face
But happiness is found in its embrace

This time, this time
This time, this time

This time, this time
