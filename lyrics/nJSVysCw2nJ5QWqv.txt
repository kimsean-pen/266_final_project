You and me at the edge of the world
with a pretty little smile for me to see
new bright whites and a cage full of ice
and a naked little canopy to feed my disease

And if you're to smile at me
I could cry by land or sea

After you said that you like Big Red
I opened up my mind and skipped a beat
cufflinks and hands in wrong places and faces
and creepy little movies made me weep

And if you're to say to me
what is mine is yours to keep

Well you know, I'll have to see
if all the stars aligned we could've solved the mystery
it's a partial fantasy
we're living in a land that went astray from history

You and me at the edge of the bed
looking at the faded pictures for you to see and me to see
murder and colonies, land without rivers
raging in the middle of some sad destiny

Take one look to find my eyes
safety's in your inner thigh

Well you know, I'll have to see,
if all the stars aligned we could have solved the mystery
it's a partial fantasy
we're living in a land that went astray from history
