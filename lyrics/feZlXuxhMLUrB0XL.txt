They couldn't believe I did it
But I was so committed
My life was so restricted for you (for you)
I just dove inside it blind
Couldn't see what swam inside
Thought I'd be romantic for you

Exchanged my vows
And said it all
Woman, let's prepare to fall
Even, screaming "dammit" for you (remember?)

My friends said you would play me
But I just said "they're crazy"
While I was crying, frantic
Was it true?

Why should I be sad?
Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do (stupid freaking things)
Why should I get back, feel sad, who knows?
Just take it all as a sign that we're through
Goodbye

It's time for me to move along (goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (OK)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (alright)
It's time for me
(Britney, let's go)

I sent you to Vegas
With a pocket full of paper
And with no ultimatums on you
I thought what could separate us
But it just seems that Vegas
Only brought the player out of you
(Hey baby, what's your name?)

Lavish homes and fancy cars
Even got the drop Ferrari
Filled up our garage for you
Made your choice with all the teams
People and US magazines
Tell me who'd I do that for, who?

Why should I be sad?
Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do (stupid freaking things)
Why should I get back, feel sad, who knows?
Just take it all as a sign that we're through
Goodbye (ah c'mon)

It's time for me to move along (ah c'mon-goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (OK)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (c'mon-alright)
It's time for me
(Britney, let's go)

It's time for me to move along (ah c'mon-goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (ah-c'mon-OK)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (alright)
It's time for me
(Britney, let's go)

(Oh) And don't you worry about our angels
(All the magazines trying to intervene
Saying things in the gossip section)
(Oh) They'll get good guidance
And be trained well
(Yeah) Don't worry I'll keep our little secret
When I ask this question

Why should I be sad?
Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do
Why should I get back, feel sad, who knows?
Just take it all as a sign that we're through
Goodbye

It's time for me to move along (goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (OK)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (alright)
It's time for me
(Britney, let's go)

It's time for me to move along (goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (OK)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (alright)
It's time for me

It's time for me to move along (goodbye)

Yeah
Come on
