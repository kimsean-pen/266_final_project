Down From The Mountain
Allen & Lande

Speeding fast
I am the downhill king
Destined to race to the end
My engine's screaming
As I crash and burn
Born to fail and never learn
I'm for tumble
You've seen it before
You chose to ignore it all
I know what I want
And you know I am bored
Down from the mountain
Down to the dark
My dying soul rest from the heart
My years of starlight
My days of rain
I see them crashing inside my brain
Down from the mountain
Bone-crushing words
You will mark my return
Licking my wounds in the wind
Dragging my questions to nevermore
Somewhere in time
Down from the mountain
Up near the top
Over again from to descend
Down from the mountain
Up near the top
To see if you will still pretend
Down from the mountain
Down from the mountain,
Down to the dark
My dying soul rest from the heart
My years of starlight
My days of rain
I see them crashing inside my brain
Down from the mountain
I'm coming fast
Across the open land
I left my past
In river dark
I played the game
And now I sing my last refrain
Down from the mountain
You will fall
Down
Down from the mountain
