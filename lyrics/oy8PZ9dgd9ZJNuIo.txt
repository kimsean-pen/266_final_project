On and on
On and on
On and on
I can't let go
On and on
I can't let go

If you are not there
I'm coming down this road again
If you I love
Then where are you?
I'm coming down, down again

Cause I can't let go
On and on
I can't let go
On and on

If you are not there
I'm coming down this road again
If you I love
Then where are you?
I'm coming down, down again
If you I love
Then where are you?
There's something wrong, wrong again

Oh, I can't let go
On and on
I just can't let go
On and on

If you are not there
I'm coming down this road again
If you I love you
Then where are you
I'm coming down, down again
If you I love you
Then where are you?
I'm coming down this road again
