This truly is the devil's crayon
Tracing your shoulder blades
Aglow like rayon
This truly is the devil's crayon
That all his children can use to draw

And we are so many tiny pieces
And we are so many tiny pieces

This truly is the devil's answer
Carved from the tongue of this romancer
This truly is the devil's answer
The oldest children used to kiss

And we are so many clambering hands
And we are so many clambering hands

The way you say her name
I want mine said the same, devil
Devildevildevil
The way you say her name I want mine said the same
Devil

This truly is the Devil's shoulder
Your arm draped around
Ten times over

This truly is the Devil's shoulder
That all his children will use to throw their loads, their loads on you
To throw their loads on you

And we are so much moulded dough
We are so much moulded dough

Used to throw their loads on you
Used to throw their loads on you
