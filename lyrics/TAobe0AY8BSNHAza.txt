I'm chilling and cruising
Always repeating the movement
These niggas they get it or lose it
I'd rather turn it to ruins
They want to tell me I'm ruthless
I think it's so fuckin' stupid
I want my sound to expand
Fuck it I don't need a plan
I like to bring up the past
They went from riches to rags
I can't be dealing with trash
I'll give your girl to my mans
She wanna party and smash
I want em chewing on xans
You wanna be done and I'm back
Why don't I show you my plans

I just got right back, from my latest phase (Yah)
Thought it would clear my mind out
Nope, still got rage
Really took some time out
Counting up the wrong days
If you flow to my mouth
Whole squad get stayed
Hold tough bars in the back of my head
Top twisted and unlocked to my skull like dreadlocks
I played the game of life is so good
I don't think il ever get set up
Reset button, Fresh dot
Wake up bet to make ten sons
I do the tricks when I take off
On the ground in my skatepark
Crushed all my Jack Joe's spot my jeweler
Nobody's home so nobody calls
I could take shots with no eyes
And without no legs and I still would score
Talk the real talk some more
I'm just that guy, cool to the core
Mr. Freeze would melt in war
I got the heat in store
I do the things that you love cause I'm bored
I made sure everything was raw
They said man's when they get it you really gon' run me
But I got it all and I called
Memories cloudy, don't remember it all
Feel like I'm Jason Bourn
Was on the grind from night till morn'
Same fucks deep when the blinds are drawn
Spit two lines
Some rhyme for sport
You goin' drown if you run out jaws
It's goin' take more than special force
You want to take my man down like an A74 now
Listen, I still think why not put mine down like wild dot silence
Peace and quiet
Live life private
I made the moves on auto pilot

I'm chilling and cruising

I want em chewing on xans
You wanna be done and I'm back
Why don't I show you my plans

I want to ride in my whip (aye)
I want to chill with my woes (damn)
I get high in my whip
Stay down with ten toes like oooh
All this motherfuckin' money change my mood
I just cut that bitch off she was getting too rude
I got so many (?) in the (?)
All this liquor in my bloodstream, I should slow it down
All you niggas wanna talk that talk
And its all the same
But I do not pay mind to commas
Swear that niggas getting paid
I track tracks in my yard
Scarlxrd still gets rowdy
I'm just fine on my own
Don't need no one 'round me
Them men there some fuckboys
Them men there some pagans
I only do this music ting to let out the frustration, like damn
