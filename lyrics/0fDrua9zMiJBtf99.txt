Fiction when we're not together
Mistaken for a vision, something of my own creation

I wake up alone, with only daylight between us
Last night the world was beneath us, tonight comes, dear love
We'll be torn apart, by the break of day
You're more than I can believe whatever come my way

Fiction when we're not together
Mistaken for a vision, something of my own creation

Come via light, why do I refuse you?
Cause if my feel's right, I risk to lose you
And if I just mind and wake up alone bring on the night

Fiction when we're not together
Mistaken for a vision, something of my own creation

And it's certainly how am I to tell?
I know your face all too well, still I wake up alone
Fiction
When we're not together
