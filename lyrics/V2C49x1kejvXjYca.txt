You can't stop
You can't stop
You can't stop
You can't stop

My hair looks like cotton candy
My heart is made of sequins
Blowpops and meat cleavers
Give me something sweet
Give me something
Give me something
Give me something sweet sweet sweet

My skin looks like vanilla
My mouth is made of sugar
Syringes and cupcakes
Give me something sweet
I'm good enough to eat
Oh yeah

You can't stop
Staring at me
You can't stop
I'm good enough to eat
You can't stop
Sticky sweet
You can't stop
Oh
(x2)

My makeup looks like rainbow sherbet
My braid feels like hard candy
Cashews and sundaes
Give me something sweet
Give me something
Give me something
Give me something sweet sweet sweet

Lipstick lightning bubblegum
Heart like a snow cone
Jawbreakers and morphine
Give me something sweet
I'm good enough to eat
Oh yea

You can't stop
Staring at me
You can't stop
I'm good enough to eat
You can't stop
Sticky sweet
You can't stop
Oh
(x2)
