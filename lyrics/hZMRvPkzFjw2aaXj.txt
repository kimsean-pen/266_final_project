My heart is on my sleeve
Wear it like a bruise or black eye
My badge, my witness means that I believed
Every single lie you said

'Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap,
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
And every little pat on the shoulder for attention
Fails to mention I still hate you

But there's a light on in Chicago
And I know I should be home
All the colors of the street signs
They remind me of the pick-up truck out in front of your neighbor's house

She took me down and said
"Boys like you are overrated" (So save your breath)
Loaded words and loaded friends
Are loaded guns to our heads

'Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
And every little pat on the shoulder for attention
Fails to mention I still hate you

But there's a light on in Chicago
And I know I should be home
All the colors of the street signs
They remind me of the pick-up truck out in front of your neighbor's house

You want apologies?
Girl, you might hold your breath
Until your breathing stops forever, forever
The only thing you'll get is this curse on your lips
I hope they taste of me forever

And there's a light on in Chicago (every pane of glass)
And I know I should be home (every pane of glass)
And the colors of the street signs
They remind me of the pick-up truck out in front of your neighbor's
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
(Well there's a light on)
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
(Light)
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again
