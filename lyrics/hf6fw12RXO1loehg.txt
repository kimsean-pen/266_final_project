Oh, excuse me, but uh, is this thing on?

I got a boyfriend, he likes to fight a lot
We got a lot in common and he thinks I fucking rock
We like to break rules, both got tattoos
We came to smash things and we like to scream, man!

Ah!
You don't want no problems
You ain't got no beef
Ah!
You don't want no problems
You don't want no beef

I don't wanna fight, tonight
(Hey, hey!)
But I ain't goin' home for no one
I don't wanna fight, tonight
(Hey, hey!)
But I ain't goin home for no one

I just wanna color outside the lines
I've been reprimanded 'bout a thousand times
I'm a rule breaker
You know that I'm a
Rule breaker

S-s-s-s-s-some say I'm a black sheep
cause I like to sleep late
Up around three o'clock, drinkin til my tummy aches
You think I'm a rebel, cause I keep makin trouble
Get here on the double 'fore I break a little somethin down

Ah!
You you you you don't want no problems
You ain't got no beef, no!
Ah!
You better keep quiet if you want your teeth!

I don't wanna fight, tonight
(Hey, hey!)
But I ain't goin' home for no one
I don't wanna fight, tonight
(Hey, hey!)
But I ain't goin' home for no one

I just wanna color outside the lines
I've been reprimanded 'bout a thousand times
I'm a rule breaker
You know that I'm a
Rule breaker

I know you are but what am I

I'm daddy's little girl
Bundle of kisses
I'm just a princess
Little miss perfect
Everyone loves that
But that's another day
There's rules to break, yeah!

I don't wanna fight, tonight
(Hey, hey!)
But I ain't goin home for no one
I don't wanna fight, tonight
(Hey, hey!)
But I ain't goin' home for no one

I don't wanna fight, tonight
(Hey, hey!)
But I ain't goin' home for no one
(I ain't goin' home for you!)
I don't wanna fight, tonight
(Hey, hey!)
But I ain't goin home for no one (No one!)
I know the grass is greener on the other side
You don't want know problems you ain't got no beef
I know they told you that you thought this pretty face
You don't want know problems you ain't got no beef
You, you, you, you don't want no problems,
You ain't got no beef!
Yo, motherfucker, why'd you stop the music
