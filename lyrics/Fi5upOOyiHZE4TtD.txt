I land on an island coast
Where the only souls I see are ghosts
I run through wooded isle
And chase the sunlight mile after mile

And I feel like I know this place
As a tree line breaks in a wide open space
I stare at a bright red sun
And search all day, never find anyone

I walk on a winding road
In the deep of the night near the edge of the knoll
I pass by a moonlit lake
And a cold wind blows and my bones start to shake

And I feel I should know this place
As a road winds on in a wide open space
The wind plays a haunting tune
As I make my way through the night all alone

I'm dreaming again of a lonesome road
Where I'm lost and I've got no friends
Just the rocks and the trees
And my lonesome dreams

And a road that'll never end
I've been dreaming again of a lonesome world
Where I'm lost and I'm on my own
[Unverified] please don't leave me alone

I lie under star-lit sky
And the seasons change in the blink of an eye
I watch as the planets turn
And the old stars die and the young stars burn

But I don't really know this place
And it's lonesome here in a wide open space
Can it be as real as it seems
Maybe this time I won't wake from the dream

I'm dreaming again of a lonesome road
Where I'm lost and I've got no friends
Just the rocks and the trees
And my lonesome dreams

And a road that'll never end
I've been dreaming again of a lonesome world
Where I'm lost and I'm on my own
[Unverified] please don't leave me alone
