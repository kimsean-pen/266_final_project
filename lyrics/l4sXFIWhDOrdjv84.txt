I was just an hourglass
With fading memories
I've been going through the motions now
Hoping to escape

I've come to terms and I know
I'm hard to love
I know I'm hard to love
Working on it everyday
Working on it everyday
It's hard to let me get away, babe

You wish it was so simple
I see it on your face
I wish the same
But baby, I'm worth it
So hang on with me

I want to warn you while I'm here at the start

I'm hard to love
I know I'm hard to love
Working on it everyday
Working on it everyday
It's hard to let me get away

I'm hard to love
I know I'm hard to love
Working on it everyday
Working on it everyday
It's hard to let me get away, babe

I'm here to tell you that you're in for a ride
Let our demons play, they've no where to hide
Don't wait
Open your eyes, eyes, eyes

I'm hard to love
I know I'm hard to love
Working on it everyday
Working on it everyday
It's hard to let me get away

I'm hard to love
I know I'm hard to love
Working on it everyday
Working on it everyday
It's hard to let me get away, babe
