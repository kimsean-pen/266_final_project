On my mind these days you're on my mind
These days when winds blow warm and flowers fill the field
A tender memory stills and through the day I find
You're on my mind

Everywhere your face seems everywhere
Up there across my sky down here around my room
I nearly hear your voice I almost feel your touch
You're on my mind

Strange and misty falling
how the memory holds me
sad but satisfying to

Bittersweet, the memory's bittersweet
The hopeful first have hope the hopeless last goodbye
A love is gone and yet when winds blow warm I find
You're on my mind
