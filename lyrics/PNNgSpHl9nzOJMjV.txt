Taken back for nothing
Make me a believer
Hold it back for no one
Make me a believer
You found a new life
Below the sunrise
You found a new, new life
Just past the limelight

Move it along now baby
Taken from what I've seen and
She can be mine when its just right wrong
Right wrong
Move it along now baby
Taken from what I've seen and
She can be mine when its just right wrong
Right wrong
Move it along now baby
Taken from what I've seen and
She can be mine when its just right wrong
Right wrong
Move it along now baby
Taken from what I've seen and
She can be mine when its just right wrong
Right wrong
