Excuse the changing, the need for minor growth
Flying into the wind that knocked you from your post
Excuse invasive hands that pull for you to come close
I paid to be here

In war time you stand alone
In war time you play alone
And I feel so tired, here I go

With distance I'm trailing, the death of the glowing host
Stepping into the window of your home
Excuse the changing hands the stranger that now owns
I paid to be here

In war time you stand alone
In war time you play alone
And I feel so tired, here I go
In war time you play alone

You are what you are
I know
So go
You are what you are
Ever changing
It's known

In war time you stand alone
In war time you play alone
And I feel so tired, down I go
In war time you play alone
