Woke out of bed
Surrounded by a broken glass
Man, the morning's rough
'Cause grieving is a tines
This drink won't be my last

Southern rain is here to stay
And you know I'm thinking of
A cloud of judgment day
Southern rain

Tumbling out
Out of love with her I swear
Even though the times are good
From looking at the past
She's not the one I loved

Southern rain is here to stay
And you know I'm thinking of
A cloud of judgment day

Through the dust, Mr. Dusk
You refused to take me back
When I need, the future's bleed
You're alive in me

Southern rain is here to stay
And you know I'm thinking of
A cloud of judgment day

Southern rain
Southern rain
