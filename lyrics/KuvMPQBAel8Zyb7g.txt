Do you still have love for me?
Do you still have love for me?
'Cos I've been falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling

Do you still have love for me?
Do you still have love for me?
'Cos I've been falling, falling, falling
For what seems like years to me

Well, here I am
Give what you can
Shouldn't breathe
I shouldn't breathe
Speak to me
Speak to me
Speak to me
Speak to me

Do you still have love for me?
Do you still have love for me?
'Cos I've been falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling

Do you still have love for me?
Do you still have love for me?
'Cos I've been falling, falling, falling
For what seems like years to me

A face that aches
A heart that breaks
And here I am
Shouldn't breathe
I shouldn't breathe
Speak to me
Speak to me
Speak to me
A face that aches
A heart that breaks
And here I am
I shouldn't breathe
I shouldn't breathe
I shouldn't breathe
I shouldn't breathe

Love me, love me, love me, love me
