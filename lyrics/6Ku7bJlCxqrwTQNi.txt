We go wow, ba-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall, just sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

Runnin one on one and only hip-hop bound
Yo Tariq (whassup) how your micraphone sound
(It sound tight) well aight, show em what it's about

We got to blow up the spot, because they must have forget
We double (trouble) bubble (bubble) bubble (bubblin hot)
Well it's like smack the track up and leave dents in it
The vocalist, bustin this blunt, instrument spit
The magnificent, rapper's run from it
All fly girls, nipples and toes, numb from it
MC's in my circumference, is confronted son
Get your growth stunted from this, you don't want it
(What nigga?) The Black Thought and M-O-S that done it
Who the ultimate? Yo my man speak up on it

Aiyyo I stop fools and drop jewels but never run it
Rock mics so nice I make you stock price plummet
All you high noon riders better rally at the summit
It's me and Tariq and your fleet outnumbered
Cross the membrane barkin big game and get hunted
Eyewitness account, say it happened so sudden
Just slid off to the side, didn't really say nuttin
Then BLAOW, blew away the 1900th

You better get your rest cause the next day comin
Oh yes, and MC's they scared to say sum'tin
Stop frontin, I'm in the cut just onlookin
Your get your kings, your rooks, rings and pawns tooken

Aiyyo, keep your tape on us so you catch the revolve
Of the Black Thought and the black man from Black Star
Illadelph and Vietnam we conference, accomplish
Even with stakes inclined, I get mine, regardless

Yo, a lot of Smurfette MC's carry purses
And rock, uniforms, that's made for nurses
I burst your verses, your words is worthless
Only touchin surface, the FUCK's the purpose?

I shot the sherriff, the deputy, and head of bank treasury
So mounties in the county got a BIG bounty stressin me
But tell 'em to hold off, they too short to measure me
Mos and Black Thought blast forth with the weaponry

We go wow, ba-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall, just sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

Yo Tariq (whassup) how your micraphone sound
(It sound tight) well aight, show em what it's about

We got to blow up the spot, because they must have forget
We double (trouble) bubble (bubble) bubble (bubblin hot)

Yeah, now check your stove top before you take a listen
And make sure beans don't burn in the kitchen
These cast iron figures just ain't fuel efficient
I play the winter breeze then choke hold your prisoner
Now you niggaz can't make pole position
Classy, chasis, can't hold the transmission
Crew pit, useless, they got they tools missin
Watch me, grand prix, champy for wealth driven

Yo, you go one for my hustle (hustle)
Two to rock rhyme (two to rock rhyme)
From the muscle kid I'm one of the illets of all time
I swing from chandeliers and wall climb
And specialize in warfares of all kind
A lot of MC's said I'm a run it down rhyme
But half the time, they run it down one of mine
Thought suffocatin em with yet another stunnin line
You dumb and blind kid, it's enlarged and underlined

What I memorized leave your whole staff pressurized
Melt down all of your artificial lies
Y'all niggaz is faker than Yellow No. 5
Swine like mono and diglyceride
My vocals got texture, you just texturized
I'm nicer than your writtens even when I'm improvised
Step into my zone get flown like fly
By the b-boy Lazarus who just won't die

Yo, me and Kamal and Leanord Hubbard,? uestlove and Malik
We go back to dollar holdings and Tahitian Treat
Or like toast in the oven with government cheese bubblin
Me and Dante like Marvin, The Troublemen travellin
Give me the mic, we on that again
B-boy business, off the top actin and battlin
Servin them cats that forgot
But don't get too close, because you might get shot

We go wow, ba-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall, just sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

Yo Tariq (whassup) how your micraphone sound
(It sound tight) well aight, show em what it's about

We bout to blow up the spot, because y'all must have forget
We double (trouble) bubble (bubble) bubble (bubblin hot)

We go wow, ba-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall, just sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

Yo Tariq (whassup) how your micraphone sound
(It sound tight) well aight, show em what it's about

We bout to blow up the spot, because y'all must have forget
We double (trouble) bubble (bubble) bubble (bubblin hot)

Say here's a little story that must be told
About two young brothers who got so much soul
They takin total control, of the body and brain
Flyin high in the sky, on a lyrical plane
It's just two bad brothers who will never quit
Mos Def and Tariq from the 2-1-5th
They rock beginnin to end, on a spiritual blend
And everybody who forgot then baby tell em again
It's just me and Tariq, with Ahmir on the beat
The Roots crew baby yo we got to make it unique
We got the soul-shockinest, body-rockinest
Non-stoppinest, Fortified Live survive the apocalypse
Rhymes we say, the perfect blend
Because we know how to rock when the beat come in
Like zen-zen-zen-zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Zen zen-zen, zen zen zen zen zen zen
Zen zen, zen zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen, zen zen zen zen
Here we go, here we here we here we go
Zen zen-zen, zen zen zen zen zen
Zen zen, zen zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Let the poppers pop, and the breakers break
Then zen-zen-zen-zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Zen zen, zenzen, zen-zen zen-zen
