I have never seen this coming
I have never climbed so high
I have never thought this could
Be the crossroads of my life

I have never seen the choices
I have never soared the sky
I have always thought
I am living just to stay alive

I let myself fall at night
To be carried by the sound
I let it all just happen
Without restraint or bound

I was afloat in the night
And it was the only route
I could not hear my thinking
The din was drowning it all out

I went further and further
The music swallowed me whole
I had to push more and more
To know how deep I could fall

I felt my grip slip away
And my time was running out
There would be but one instant
For me to vanquish my doubt

How long since I slept?
How long since I ate?
How long since I felt?
How long since I cared?

I have never heard the voices
They have never made me cry
I have never thought this would
Be the crossroads of my life

I have never seen the choices
I have never soared the sky
I have always thought I am
Living just to stay alive

I have never seen this coming
I have never climbed so high
I have never thought this could
Be the crossroads of my life

How long since I slept?
How long since I ate?
How long since I felt?
How long since I cared?

I have never heard the voices
They have never made me cry
I have never thought this would
Be the crossroads of my life

I have never seen the choices
I have never soared the sky
I have always thought I am
Living just to stay alive

I have never seen this coming
I have never climbed so high
I have never thought this could
Be the crossroads of my life

I have never seen this coming
I have never climbed so high
I have never thought this could
Be the crossroads of my life
