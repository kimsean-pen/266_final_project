I stopped watching from the first home
We're gathering for a throne
Taped up with a gold top
Feather covered,
We're combing over dead shots
Forcing old hymns through a naked swim
We're crawling up from the cold whims
Tell me when you're out
We're caught limping through the back door
A fever twist, nothing more
Death toll for a whistle blow
The giant levers, stolen off the marrow
Claiming tried friends with an empty tact
Appeal enough and we fall back
Tell me when you're out
