Yeah
I ain't afraid of the dark
I ain't worried about the savages loose in the night
But you show me the things I've done
And girl you know
I get the ch-ch-ch-chills all down my crooked spine

Kill the lights
Kill the lights
Kill the lights
I've seen too much
If so below, then as above
Lord knows I've seen enough

It's crystal clear and uglier than I thought
Desperate and lonely juggernauts
Illuminate the filth
With the glow of your righteous heart
Shine a light upon the world
And I'll scurry back to the dark

Lights on (Hey, hey)
Rats out (Hey, hey)
Somebody turn on the light (Hey, hey)
Get the rats out (Hey, hey)

The uppers lower me into the hive
The lights are low, us weeds come alive
Downers pick me up into the ditch
I cannot scratch this never-ending itch

Salvation is a hell of a thing
Salvation is a hell of a thing
Salvation is a hell of a thing
Pull the dust up over your eyes

I don't believe I'll have a revelation with all these secrets of mine
And if I ever have a holy vision
It's going to be, two at a time
I got so much soul in me that I'm barely alive
I've been down and out for so long, baby, I can't be revived

Yeah
I ain't afraid to be long lost
I ain't bothered by the silence,
the cold, or the roads that stretch for miles
But you show me the man I've become
And girl you know I want to tie up a rope
And crack my crooked spine

Kill the lights
Kill the lights
Kill the lights
I've seen too much
