Friday night, the party's alright
But no one really gives a fuck
If I don't end up showing up tonight

And I gotta say, that this week, has got me beat baby
How come everything important, only happens when I'm dormant?
Why does everything that's neat only happen when I sleep?

I'm at home in my bed alone
Thinking who's the one that's gonna take you home
Singing baby its okay
It happens every day

Now I'm all for getting fucked up in a field
But there's just one issue
No walls to sink my roots into
And you say your fucking love is real
Yet I always catch you falling back
On hockey boys in baseball caps

With shit for brains it's a constant train of spitting, dip, and taking names
But oh I'm still safe in my sheets
Wondering why everything important, only happens when I'm dormant?
Why does everything that's neat only happen when I sleep?

Whats it mean?

I'm at home in my bed alone,
Thinking who's the one thats gonna take you home
Singing baby it's okay
It happens every day

Eyes that conspire, do no wrong
They just stare too long
As the knees, above my feet
Start to crease in my moment of clarity

For now I see
That a pirates lifes' the life for me
Yea a pirates lifes' the life for me
Yea a pirates lifes' the life for me

She say "What's it mean to be nineteen"
I said sail the seas - all seven clean
Yeah a pirates lifes' the life for me
Yeah a pirates lifes' the life for me

Short and sweet
You and me
You and me live defeated till our feet hit the sand,
Top the tide, to the wind screaming
Fuck the dry land can't be beat

Oh just you and me
