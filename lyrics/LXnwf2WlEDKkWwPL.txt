I hopped off the plane at L.A.X
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess, am I gonna fit in?

Jumped in the cab here I am for the first time
Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy, everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turning and I'm feeling kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio

And a Jay-Z song was on
And the Jay-Z song was on
And the Jay-Z song was on

So I put my hands up they're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like yeah
Moving my hips like yeah

Put my hands up they're playing my song
I know I'm gonna be ok
Yeah-Eh-Yeah-Eh-Yeah-Eh
It's a party in the U.S.A
