I come to write a different word in a different way
I speak of your hurt so that you can ache
I run to raise a warning sign in the early hours
I know you don't mind that you lost your powers

So run across the water in the air
Run across to find all your fears
Tear it all from under 'til you've lost your mind
But tell me that you...

Set yourself free
Set yourself free
Free of the mire and false desires
And pull free

Set yourself free
