Some days I wake up
And I just want you all around me
Some nights I call out
What if the life in you lost me?
The weight of the world feels
The weight of the world it feels heartless
Forever we fade out
'Cause I'm too afraid to be honest

Why am I so cynical?
Lifelines are difficult
For me

In my whole life
There's silence where I stood
I found you in the lone light
Never knew it felt this good
Won't you teach me how to see
The way you see me

Alive in the snowed pines
The fire is waiting around me
Your freedom is all mine
The deep and the dark are aligning

Why am I so cynical?
Lifelines are difficult

In my whole life
There's silence where I stood
I found you in the lone light
Never knew it felt this good
Won't you teach me how to see
The way you see me

Wake up in the worn night
I fill you with a love then a silence
I was in the cold tide
See you when the sight is burning down
Hold me near and I will steal
The solid ground

In my whole life
There's silence where I stood
I found you in the lone light
Never knew it felt this good
Won't you teach me how to see
The way you see me

It's taken up my whole life
The silence where I stood
I found you in the lone light
Never knew it felt this good
Won't you teach me how to see
The way you see me
