One thing I know
I'm gonna die
If they bury my body baby
My soul is gonna reach the sky

I know it's gonna happen but I hope it don't happen soon
Because I don't want to stop what
we're doing in the middle of the afternoon
And there's no one around
My life without you

If you're feeling low
And you're drinking all the time
You better hide your gun from yourself
'cause the trigger won't change it's mind
I know I see it happening
It better not happen to you
[?] what we left holding the pieces
while there's nothing left worth nothing

I don't want to live my life without you

I'm gonna die
Gonna take away the pain
I've already said goodbye to them
[?] see me again
