It's been a long time

I didn't think I was
Going to see you again
See you haven't changed
It's good to see you anyway
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
When I think about you
My feelings can't explain
Why after all this time

My heart still feels pain
When I look at you
Memories of love
Like no one before
You stay on my mind
(Special feelings, special time)
Always so special
(I was yours and you were mine)
Made for each other

(All the good I won't forget)
You will stay on my mind
(Saturday, the day we met)
For always and for ever
You will be my Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
When I think about you
My feelings can't explain
Why after all this time
My heart still feels pain
When I look at you

Memories of love
Like no one before
You stay on my mind
(Special feelings, special times)
Feeling so special
(I was yours and you were mine)
Made for each other, girl
(All the good I won't forget)
Staying on my mind, girl

(Saturday, the day we met)
Girl, you know I can't leave you behind
There's never any question
You will be my Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
When I look at you
Special feelings, special times
I thought we'd always be together
But sometimes things just
Don't work out like we planned
Life goes on and people grow
Out of things that fit before

But Saturday remains the same
And I hope it'll never change
For always and forever
You will be my (you will be my)
You will be my (you will be my)
You will be my (you will be my)
Be (be my Saturday love)
My Saturday love
Do do do do
Let's sing it together
Never on Sunday, Monday's too soon
Tuesday and Wednesday just won't do
Thursday and Friday, we can begin
But our Saturday love
Will never end, sugar
