Like an outlaw bustin' through that door
Hands up, root, scootin' on the dancefloor
Wanna see ya see just how you move
Wanna getcha getcha into this groove
No, you ain't no lady
And you ain't nobody's baby
No, you ain't no lady
And you ain't nobody's baby
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Giddy-up, get down
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Swing your partner ('round and 'round)
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Giddy-up, get down
Shake that booty (to the ground)
(Get it girl)
You been shakin' up this one-horse town
Everybody talkin' miles around
Honky-tonk is rockin', stake your claim
Honky-tonk is rockin' in your name
No, you ain't no lady
And you ain't nobody's baby
No, you ain't no lady
And you ain't nobody's baby
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Giddy-up, get down
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Swing your partner ('round and 'round)
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Giddy-up, get down
Shake that booty (to the ground)
Hey hey
Wo-oah, wo-oah, wo-oah
Hey hey
Wo-oah, wo-oah, wo-oah
No, you ain't no lady
And you ain't nobody's baby
No, you ain't no lady
And you ain't nobody's baby
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Giddy-up, get down
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Swing your partner ('round and 'round)
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Giddy-up, get down
Shake that booty (to the ground)
