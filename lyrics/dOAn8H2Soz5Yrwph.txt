I can't see where you're comin' from
But I know just what you're runnin' from
And what matters ain't the who's baddest but the
Ones who stop you falling from your ladder

When you feel like you're feeling now
And doin' things just to please your crowd
When I love you like the way I love you
And I suffer but I ain't gonna cut you 'cause

This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home

This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home

And every time I close my eyes
I think, I think about you inside
And your mother givin' up on asking why
Why you lie and you cheat
and you try to make a fool out of she

I can't see where you're comin' from
But I know just what you're runnin' from
And what matters ain't the who's baddest but the
Ones who stop you falling from your ladder, cause

This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home
This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home
