We're losing several steps ahead, it's strange
Anything you do, anyway you move
Then with any strain it feels so helpless
I trap we build ourselves, we can be without

When you pulled away, I say it matters
With the quiet face, heartbreak I shatter
Then okay, we'll train but after
Nothing new to see, saying what you mean
When you pulled away

I imagine talks last all night
Never bringing up, but every day I want to
I think about us dancing, but it's not something we do
There's my dream, doesn't it sound good to you

When you pulled away, I say it matters
With the quiet face, heartbreak I shatter
Then okay, we'll train but after
Nothing new to see, saying what you mean
When you pulled away

When you pulled away, I say it matters
With the quiet face, heartbreak I shatter
Then okay, we'll train but after
Nothing new to see, saying what you mean
When you pulled away

Nothing new to see, saying what you mean
When you pulled away
