There was once a boy
With knives stuck in his voice
All he wanted, all he wanted was a little affection

Until one day he came
To tempt his mother's taste
All she wanted, all she wanted was to spread her infection

He spins her spindle weaving fuse
Burning fumes of lucid youth to mend
Her broken flesh

They've stolen all my love
Buried in absentia rose
Can you hear my vitreous heart
Breaking in absentia rose
Smokestacks burning
Eidolon turning
I won't ever let you go
They've stolen all my love
Yes they've stolen all my love

He brings her the bait
She makes him her pet
Does he want some
Does he want a little insurrection?

With oneiric days
In somatic days
Ocular incision
I'm the reason
I just gotta get out of here

He spins her spindle weaving fuse
Burning fumes of lucid youth to mend
Her useless flesh

They've stolen all my love
Buried in absentia rose
Can you hear my vitreous heart
Breaking in absentia rose
Smokestacks burn
Eidolon turning
But I won't ever let you go
They've stolen all my love
Yes, they've stolen all my love

Taken by the night
Divagate remembrance
Check the puzzle, does it fit?
I am alpha and omega

And on the seventh day I rise
Past the pangs of my resistance
When the son gives up his throne
What becomes of this theft

Dasehra
Make these shackles go away
Dasehra
Make these shackles go away
Dasehra
Won't you help me stand my ground if I should fall?

Dasehra
As long as I am injured
Dasehra
As long as I remember

Dasehra
As long as I am injured
Dasehra
As long as I remember

Dasehra
As long as I am injured
Dasehra
As long as I remember

Dasehra
As long as I am injured
