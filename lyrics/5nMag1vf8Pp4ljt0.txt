Here I lay
Still and breathless
Just like always
Still I want some more
Mirror's sideways
Who cares what's behind
Just like always
Still your passenger,
Chrome buttons buckled on leather surfaces.
These and other lucky witnesses
Now to calm me
This time won't you please...

Drive faster!
Roll the window down this, cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in, who cares who sees anything?

I'm your passenger

I'm your passenger
Drop... these down
Then... put them on me
Nice... cool seats there
To cushion your needs. Now to calm me
Take me around again
Don't pull over
This time won't you please

Drive faster!
Roll the window down this, cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in, who cares who sees what tonight?
Roll these misty windows, down to catch my breath and then
Go and go and don't just, drive me home and back again!

Here I lay
Just like always
Don't let me
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Take me to the end...
