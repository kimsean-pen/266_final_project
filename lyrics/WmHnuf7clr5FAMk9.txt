Crystal ball, crystal clear
I am far away from here
In my mind, a little nervous
Cause in a weird way, I deserve this
How was I supposed to know?
When in my heart, and in my mind
Everything seems to remind
When in my heart, and in my head
I try so hard to forget

I'm reminded
Of that summer
I'm reminded, of that summer, of that summer

Now I know what I shoulda did
Gone all day to the beach with you
Next time I know what I'll do
I'm gonna go all day to the beach with you

Your long hair, I comb it with my fingers while we wait
I will love you, until my hair falls out or all turns gray
You sleep, I sleep,
Watch TV, like tea leaves
Play video games, it's all the same
Everything I do negatively affects my brain
But I deserve it, and you deserve it too

I'm reminded
Of that summer
I'm reminded, of the summer, of that summer
Now I know what I shoulda did
Gone all day to the beach with you
Next time I know what I'll do
I'm gonna go all day to the beach with you

Hindsight twenty twenty true
But at the time I didn't know what to do

And now I know what I shoulda did
Gone all day to the beach with you
Next time I know what I'll do
I'm gonna go all day to the beach with you
Now I know what I shoulda did
Gone all day to the beach with you
Next time I know what I'll do
I'm gonna go all day to the beach with you

Hindsight twenty twenty true
But at the time I didn't know what to do
