And I know this for sure
There's nothin' left for her

No!

And I spent it all up
No change left for her cup

No!

And I fancy the moon's full
I feel her push and pull

Yeah!

There's no love lost and none found
I feel her comin' round

Yeah!

Now she is waitin' for the night
To see if everything's all right

She do the hardest things for free
And now there's nothin' left for me(-hee!)

No time left
I've spend
No money
No love
No tenderne-e-ess

Yeah!

My patience wasted
Our problems of no significa-a-ance

Yeah!
