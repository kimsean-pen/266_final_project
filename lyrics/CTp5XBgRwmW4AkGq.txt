I feel you breathing down my neck
As the blood's rushing through my legs
Waiting for a chance to prove that my soul
It belongs to you
I just wanna go there,
I just want a beautiful escape
I just wanna move ya
Show you that this love is yours to take
And now we're driving over,
Fears that makes us feel like we're not enough
Yeah, we're flying up, closer
Dancing on the edge of the world above
I was scared I couldn't show ya
All this lovin' that I hold inside
But now I feel your power
I am here, and I don't wanna hide no more
No more

Now I'm feeling like you're with me
As my heart's pouring on my sleeve
I don't want this rush to go
Oh I'm trying to let you know
I just wanna go there
I just want a beautiful escape
I just wanna move ya
I just wanna take you to that place
And now we're driving over,
Fears that makes us feel like we're not enough
Yeah, we're flying up, closer
Dancing on the edge of the world above
I was scared I couldn't show ya
All this lovin' that I hold inside
But now I feel your power
I am here, and I don't wanna hide no more
No more
No more
No more
