There's a life outside I didn't know
Tied up, falling down to an empty soul
And lord knows that this love has taken toll
I've given all of my love to this broken home

So why don't you lose yourself for me
Why don't you lose yourself for me
What is it that your eyes don't see
Why don't you lose yourself for me
Why don't you lose yourself, for me

It won't work if it don't make sense at all
I'm so lost that I can't see through the fold
The same stains that were left from the cherry whine
The same stains that I wish we could both rewind

Did you notice that the feeling ain't never gone?
Did you notice it's the feeling you've been running from
You wouldn't notice if your eyes ain't falling for me
Did you open up my heart
Just to take it from me

So why don't you lose yourself for me
So why don't you lose yourself for me
What is it that your eyes don't see
Why don't you lose yourself for me
Why don't you lose yourself for me
Why don't you lose yourself for me

Lose yourself from playing games
Lose yourself, it ain't the same
Lose yourself from playing games
Lose yourself from playing games
Lose yourself from playing games
Lose yourself from playing games
Lose yourself from playing games
Lose yourself from playing games

When sometimes you could be lost, you could be found
I've been lost
I've been lost again and I've been find
Then I found myself but I'm constantly finding myself
