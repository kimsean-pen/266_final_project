All of us walk a long, steady line
And now that you're gone
I have nothing but time
To walk with your bags
Down to the docks
And sit in the grass
Right in your spot
In ear park,
In ear park

If you listen
You'd hear the waves

Oh, we all forgot, dear
We can't forget, dear

All the time
All the time
All the time
All the time
