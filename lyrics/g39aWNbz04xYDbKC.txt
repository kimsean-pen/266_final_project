It was nothing but a quick think
kids games, kiss chase, just a quick fling
now im hoping you never go missing
now im telling you, you can hold this ring, watch how it glistens
it was done as quick as the wind blows
didnt think i would ever be involved
so i even wrote a song called dont go
now its just you and me on a love row
Dappy like dino us two tip toes duck dive get low
and now i care less about who knows
now were deep in way past intro dappy explain yo

See never did i think a boy like me would be in need
when all i really wanted was to have some fun (Now I'm losin my head)
now im losing my head, im telling you one thing
youre number one

See i dont understand how youre number one
when it was just a fling before now, youre the one
see all i did was blink twice, from my homie to my only
number one
ah uh uh oh

I never thought I'd get here, never thought I would care
'Cause I was always lookin' out for me
I was being selfish, I couldn't see
All that I want was right in front of me
But baby I've changed, this girl of her teens
You're my number one, now you're priority

See never did i think a boy like me would be in need
when all i really wanted was to have some fun (Now I'm losin my head)
now im losing my head, im telling you one thing
youre number one

See i dont understand how youre number one
when it was just a fling before now, youre the one
see all i did was blink twice from my homie to my only
number one
you lift me off the ground
i always want you around
i aint gunna let nothing get in the way
ill never let nothing get in the way
you lift me off the ground
i always want you around
i aint gunna let nothing get in the way
ill never let nothing get in the way

Trust me when I say, that I ain't never gonna let nothin get in the way
'Cause we was always cool as friends back in the day
It's funny how you've changed, you've got me goin insane
See you ain't like the rest you run in your own lane
You are number one

See i dont understand how youre number one
when it was just a fling before now, youre the one
see all i did was blink twice from my homie to my only
number one
you lift me off the ground
i always want you around
i aint gunna let nothing get in the way
ill never let nothing get in the way
you lift me off the ground
i always want you around
i aint gunna let nothing get in the way
ill never let nothing get in the way

You're number one youre in the race youre a leader
girl youre out of this world i cant see ya
and now you got a place in my heart
its funny how you actually went
from my homie to my only
number one
