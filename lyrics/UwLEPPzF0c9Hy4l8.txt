Chrome neon Jesus
You are the ghost in the machine
Come to receive us
Don't wait for me

White hot heels and motion sick
This town is dead, there's nothing left to give
Have you forgotten what it's like?
A phone call from another life
The payphone is dead but you're still on the line
I guess we're all just killing time

Chrome neon Jesus
You are the ghost in the machine
Come to receive us
Don't wait for me

Your mother Llorona and cheap wine
Your electric drone in the limelight
Forever alone but it's alright
But it's alright

Blackout lips and dirty streets
Dig up the bones when nothing feels complete
I fade out with the morning light
Shake me down, a nervous wreck
A goodbye to me and what's left to confess
I guess we're all just killing time

Chrome neon Jesus
You are the ghost in that machine
Come to receive us
Don't wait for me

Your mother Llorona and cheap wine
Your electric drone in the limelight
Forever alone but it's alright
But it's alright
