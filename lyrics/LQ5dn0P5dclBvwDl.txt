Tell me what to say
To make it go away and I'll do that
Tell me what to do
To make it up to you and I'll do that too

Time means so much
If all I have is your sweet touch
And so it goes, and so it goes
Which way I've never ever known

Do I hold you back in all the ways?
I lack what ya' need, dear
And headed toward the end
You were looking for a friend
And that ain't me, dear

Time means so much
If all I have is your sweet touch
And so it goes, and so it goes
Which way I'll never never know
