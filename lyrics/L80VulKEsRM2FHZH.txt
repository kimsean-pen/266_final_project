Lately there seems to be some insecurities
About the way I feel where I wanna be
Boy you know it's with you
No one can do the things you do to me

Never to be mistaking long as it's love we're making
There'll be no hesitating you and me
And it always will be and I wont leave your side
'Cause you know

Love will be right here, be right here
Right here, be right here
No fear, have no fear
No tears love is here

True love some don't believe in
That's just what I'm giving
I'm gonna keep it strong I'll be holding on to you
No one can do me like you do it's true

Sure as the sun is shining our love will keep on climbing
There's gonna be some rain gonna be some pain
But as long as I know boy time will show
Our love will grow and I know

Love will be right here, be right here
Right here, be right here
No fear, have no fear
No tears love is here

Love will be right here, be right here
Right here, be right here
No fear, have no fear
No tears love is here

Won't let go you should know this thing is real
No questions, just listen to you heart and love will be right

Baby, what's the problem
It's seems like we're having trouble
You don't seem to understand
The life I lead ain't double

My heart belongs to you, and only you
And you know it's true
A phony imitation just won't do
Relax your mind

I'm not the kind who runs around
And wastes time, other fine brothers just don't compare
I'll be there, I swear, far or near, have no fear
I don't care, you can count on me, I'm right here

Right here, be right here
Right here, be right here
No fear, have no fear
No tears love is here

Right here, be right here
Right here, be right here
No fear, have no fear
No tears love is here

Right here, be right here
Right here, be right here
No fear, have no fear
No tears love is here

Right here, be right here
Right here, be right here
No fear, have no fear
