All I need in my life is
There is nothing like this
I've never felt quite like this
All I need my life is

All I need in my life is
There is nothing like this
I've never felt quite like this
All I need my life is

Incomplete when you're away
You turn my nights into days
You show me the light, uh huh
Gotta have you right away

I've never felt quite like this
All I need in my life
(Is you)
There is nothing like this
I've never felt quite like this

You breathe life into me
And I think I'm in too deep
I'm addicted, uh huh
Something tells me you're the one

I've never felt quite like this
(Feels good)
All I need my life
(Is you)
There is nothing like this
(No)

I've never felt quite like this
(Feels good)
All I need my life
(Is you)
There is nothing like this
(No)
