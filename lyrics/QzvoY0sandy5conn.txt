Just like a white wing dove sings a song sounds like she sing it
Just like a white wing dove sings a song sounds like she sing it
Oh baby oh
And the days go by like a strand in the wind in the work
That is my own i begin again
Said to my friend baby, nothing else matters
Well he was no more that a baby then

Well he seemed broked hearted something with in him
But the moment that i first layed eyes on him
All alone on the edge of seventeen

Just like a white wing dove sings a song sounds like she sing it
Oh baby oh
Just like a white wing dove sings a song sounds like she sing it
Oh baby oh

I went today mayb i will go again tommorow
Yeh yeh and the music there it was hautingly fammiliar
And I see you doing what i try to do for me
With the words of a poet and the voice of a quieer
And the melody nothing else matters

Just like a white wing dove sings a sound just like she sing it
Oh baby oh
Just like a white wing dove sings a sound just like she sing it
Oh baby oh

Coulds never expected with it rains but the sea changes colours
But the sea does not change
And so will the snow, gracefull flow of 8
High wind fold with an age old desire to please on the edge of seventeen

Just like a white wing dove sings a song sounds like she sing it
Oh baby oh
Just like a white wing dove sings a song sounds like she sing it
Oh baby oh
