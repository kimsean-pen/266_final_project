i gotta rhythm for none
i gotta rhythm for some
forget about it

i gotta reason to loan
i gotta reason to own
forget about it

i never feature just one
i gotta limited run

i found a way to never be home
i found a way to soak up the sun
i found a way to never be home
i found a way to never be wrong

you need to clean up your tone
i gotta handle the phone
i never needed your loan
i gotta handle the phone

i found a way to never be home
i found a way to soak up the sun
i found a way to never be home
i found a way to never be wrong

somebody put me on the dollar
i found a way to
i want to get me on the dollar
i found a way to
i found a way to
i found a way to soak up the sun
i found a way to never be home
i found a way to never be wrong

i'd never ask you two to follow
found a way to
i'm only askin if you follow
found a way to
found a way to

i found a way to soak up the sun
