We all come from an explosion in the sky
One day there was nothing and the next there was life
And all the rivers and the mountains and the sun and the moon
And all of a sudden there's a cloud of doom

It's a trap
There's no comfort fitting in
A fake safety that no one believes in
And if it goes against who you think you are
It's the death of happiness
Go and get the crowbar

We all fell down from a tired dying star
Star dust on the breeze the fuckin' pic and avatar
From nothing into all and then the next thing to arrive
Is the terrifying fear of how you're supposed to live your life

It's a trap
There's no comfort fitting in
A fake safety that no one believes in
And if it goes against who you think you are
It's the death of happiness
Go and get the crowbar

People everywhere will try to bring you down
Those jealous motherfuckers they will try and take your crown
It's easier for them to put you in a box
Keep you safely locked away because they hate it when the boat's rocked
But fuck â€˜em all, they don't tell us who we are
So when they try and lock you up, go and get the fucking crowbar!

It's a trap
There's no comfort fitting in
A fake safety that no one believes in
And if it goes against who you think you are
It's the death of happiness
Go and get the crowbar
