We've been around for so long, we've started dreaming of the past
We'll find the gleam in our eyes and close our lids to make it last

Now don't you try to stop me, I'm not content in my role
These walls of dirt are pending, pushing my need of control

These moments are keeping your mind away and keeping injustice now
These moments are leading your head astray and keeping injustice now

We've sung these songs for so long, you've seen us scream behind the mold
We've dug the perfect treasures but never seen the modern gold

You did your time, don't you know
You don't have to conquor mentality once more
You did your time, you should know
Freedom of thought isn't worth fighting for
