When you rust red like blood I wonder
Whose house is this? A spell I'm under
Who's wrapped in bed and sweetty sleeping?
I carve my name into the ceiling

You'll always control me
You'll always control
You'll always control me
You'll always have control

Take my madness beneath your heel
Even if it bends

Painting myself in all four corners
We'd offer this room from The front door?
Whose house is this? A gift was promised
You'll draw structures till we all got it?

You'll always control me
You'll always control
You'll always control me
You'll always have control

Take my madness beneath your heel even if it bends

My life in this glass house impossible to get out
My life in this glass house impossible to get out
My life in this glass house impossible to get out
My life in this glass house impossible to get out
My life in this glass house impossible to get out
My life in this glass house impossible to get out
My life in this glass house impossible to get out
My life in this glass house impossible to get out
My life in this glass house impossible to get out
