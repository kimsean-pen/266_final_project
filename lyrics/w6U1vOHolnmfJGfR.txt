Get up
Pull me out the dead sea
Clean up
Let the water clear my memory

A day, a week, a month, a year, a life
A life to fear
Live on

So what's real?
I only read the bad signs
Just don't leave
I keep on digging for a life line

A day, a week, a month, a year, a life
A life to fear
Live on
Live on

Wait up
Distract me of my fantasy
Wait up
I need to find a remedy

A day, a week, a month, a year, a life
A life to fear
Live on
Live on

Live on
Or give up
