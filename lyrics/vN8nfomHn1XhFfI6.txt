You thought we'd be fine
All these years gone by
Now you're asking me to listen
Well, then tell me 'bout everything
No lies, we're losing time

'Cause this is a battle
And it's your final last call
It was a trial, you made a mistake, we know
But why aren't you sorry, why aren't you sorry, why?
This can be better, you used to be happy, try

You've got them on your side
They won't change their minds
Now it's over and I'm feeling like
We've missed out on everything
I just hope it's worth the fight

'Cause this is a battle
And it's your final last call
(Why'd you have to let it go?)
It was a trial, you made a mistake, we know
(Can't you see you hurt me so?)
Why aren't you sorry, why aren't you sorry, why?
Things can be better, you could be happy, try

'Cause this is a battle
And it's your final last call
It was a trial, you made a mistake, we know
(Can't you see you hurt me so?)
But why aren't you sorry, why aren't you sorry, why?
This can be better, we can be happy, try

'Cause this is a battle
This is a battle
And it's your final last call
'Cause this is a battle
This is a battle
And it's your final last call
This is a battle and it's your final last call
