Man, don't you hate when you're all like
"Man, I wanna kill some rats"
And then the, the bitch-ass animal company is like
"No"
So, what now?

PETA on my dick
PETA PETA on my dick
PETA on my dick
PETA PETA on my dick
PETA on my dick
PETA PETA on my dick
PETA on my dick
PETA PETA on my dick

I've been shooting dogs with BB guns since I was five
If you want to witness, you can come and see me live (Ooh!)
I be trapping cats in AC units all the time
Let them freeze, baby
Give the mice a head start, please, baby

PETA trynna take away the fun life
They always sending people to my condo
Like, "Who you is, and how you getting all this mammal fur?"
I tell them, go ahead, and check-a check that bank roll

I got a camel-fur coat, gator-skin duffel bag
Chinese labrador rug price tags
Sea turtle shell, money clip, hella tablerags
And handkerchief straight out of the African wild

Yeah, I don't give a fuck about the dolphins on my back
Man, I know a guy, who knows a guy, I get it like that
With a polar bear ceiling fan cooling down my back
And a kangaroo pouch to hold my diamonds and rags

I sewed a bunch of rats to a quilt
All this fur got me feeling like Cruella de Vil
I've been lurking on my neighbor's dalmatians for weeks, man
If you trying to split the profit, call my pager for deets

They try to shut me down, that's a no, no
They all trying to hit me with the low blows
But I never pay attention, I just pay in cash
If you trying to ask some questions, man, get off my fucking ass, uh

PETA on my dick
PETA PETA on my dick
PETA on my dick
PETA PETA on my dick
PETA on my dick
PETA PETA on my dick
PETA on my dick
PETA PETA on my dick
Yaa
