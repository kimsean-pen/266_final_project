I know I'm lost with no motivation to find my way back
I left myself down a paper trail of the pages of my mind, now I want them back,
I'm somewhere between no courage among the other things I lack
Lost in desperation where an ember turns to an ash
Somewhere along this path I crossed the line

Broken promises I've made without thinking twice
Left my second thought and reason behind
All in the name of making this world mine
All in the name of
Building my own
Why do I think that I have to live this life alone, I know I'm lost

I know, I know I'm lost
I know, I know I'm lost
But what scares me the most is I'm starting to feel at home
I know, I know I can't stay here forever
When we lose ourselves we find each other

I find this strange comfort in being lost in life
Wherever I end up will I belong there this time?
So when you feel your heart sink into your chest
Don't forget everything is okay in the end
We are not okay but this is not the end yet

We are not okay but this is not the end yet
We are not okay but this is not the end

I know, I know I'm lost
I know, I know I'm lost
But what scares me the most is I'm starting to feel at home
I know, I know I can't stay here forever
when we lose ourselves we find each other
