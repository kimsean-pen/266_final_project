Eleven ten nine eight seven

Don't cut me off
Don't cut me off
Don't cut me off
Don't cut me off

I know, 'cause I'm trying
And I thought you lied
I know, 'cause I'm lying

So don't cut me off
I'm in my own time
So don't cut me off
I'm in my own time

There I go

And I wanna get out, walk inside
Fill up my cup and drink it dry

So don't cut me off
I'm in my own time
So don't cut me off
I'm in my own time

(Thirteen thirteen nine twelve)

And I wanna get out, walk inside
Fill up my cup
You're still on my mind
You're still on my mind

I am where I wanna be
I got a good thing going now
I got a good thing going now
So don't cut me o-
