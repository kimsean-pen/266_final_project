You don't know what you do to me
Everytime you come around
I can't seem to find my way
I'm shifted baby, losing ground

It's like I'm spinning all around in circles
Cure me, you're my remedy
I get dizzy from the sound of your name
I feel so intoxicated when you spin me baby

You spin me right round baby right round
like a record baby right round round round
You spin me right round baby right round
like a record baby right round round round
Round and round

I can't help this craving honey
Everytime you look at me
I am feeling so lost
in oblivion that I can't breathe

It's like I'm moving right along with the beat
Work me, you're my melody
I get dizzy from the sound of your name
I feel so intoxicated when you spin me baby

You spin me right round baby right round
like a record baby right round round round
You spin me right round baby right round
like a record baby right round round round
Round and round

(Spin, spin me baby
Spin, spin, spin me baby
Round and round
Spin, spin)

I get dizzy from the sound of your name
I feel so intoxicated when you spin me baby

You spin me right round baby right round
like a record baby right round round round
You spin me right round baby right round
like a record baby right round round round

You spin me right round baby right round
like a record baby right round round round
You spin me right round baby right round
like a record baby right round round round
