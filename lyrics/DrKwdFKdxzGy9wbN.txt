We are created the suffering ones
Condemned by the dying
We sing out in tongues.
Caught in obsession with all that we love.

Never look forward, just straight down the gun
Whoooah

I can't take it any more
Whoooah
Every day feels like a war
The Devil in the mirror
Screaming that my heart is flawed

I'm never gonna let you win
No I will not surrender
Even if I start to fall
I swear to you I'll rise again

Cast the illusions of hatred and pride
Take the communion in faith they provide

I'm just a human not ready to die
My voice is a weapon, my fear is a lie
Whoooah
I can't take it anymore
Whoooah

Everyday feels like a war
The Devil in the mirror

Screaming that my heart is flawed
I'm never gonna let you win
No I will not surrender
Even if I start to fall
I swear to you I'll rise again.

Whoooah
I can't take it anymore
Whoooah
Everyday feels like a war
The Devil in the mirror
Screaming that my heart is flawed
I'm never gonna let you win
No I will not surrender
Even if I start to fall
I swear to you I'll rise again.
The Devil in the mirror
Screaming that my heart is flawed
I'm never gonna let you win
No I will not surrender
Even if I start to fall
I swear to you I'll rise again.
