Everlasting
If this chemistry we got is everlasting

[Chorus]
Excuse me shawty
I saw you passing
How 'bout we get stuck together like we in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm asking if the chemistry we got is everlasting
If the chemistry we got is everlasting
If this chemistry we got is everlasting
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just asking

I know this sound like all those love songs
Perhaps it's on time since all the love's gone
And we trap it out, trap it out, but you don't like it hot
Cause you don't know what they rap about nowadays, I don't know either
But I ain't like most people
I'ma hit you with that "How you doin'? What you vibing to and can I vibe with you?
And if the world was filled with flowers surrounded by waterfalls And mountains despite the fact I just mentioned, can I lie with you?"
Shit, we outside the club though
And I'm knowing what I'm saying make you wonder what I'm at the club for
To tell the truth I barely go out
I know your homegirl, she kick it with my partner and tag along with him
And they knew a friend that had a friend that I should meet
She don't like clubs but she fall through sometimes just to see
So I'm guessing that you're her and it's just you and me
Let's skip out on this waterhole and find a place to be
In peace

Excuse me shawty
I saw you passing
How 'bout we get stuck together like we in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm asking if the chemistry we got is everlasting
If the chemistry we got is everlasting
If this chemistry we got is everlasting
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just asking

Ayy, excuse me shawty, if you don't mind me
Pointing out the fact you're just my type
I mean my type like when God broke the mold and designed you From head to toe he know I'd fall in love with you at first sight
I know there ain't no gangsta gangsta shit but I figured you here
I'm a hood nigga, fuck with me, damn you bad shawty all the time
Don't get me wrong, that was me as a teenager
But I'm grown now and I think you deserve a better life
But not life like spit game, more like spiritual flames
To ignite the natural high that we all got
I know your homegirl told you don't fuck with us country boys
Cause we players, but we all not
I admit I ain't perfect but who is nowadays?
A man can break your heart all sorts of kinda ways
But if you take my number down and hit me when you home
I can promise you I ain't shit like Tyrone
Excuse me shawty

Excuse me shawty
I saw you passing
How 'bout we get stuck together like we in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm asking if the chemistry we got is everlasting
If the chemistry we got is everlasting
If this chemistry we got is everlasting
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just asking

Excuse me shawty
Excuse me shawty
Excuse me shawty

Excuse me shawty
I saw you passing
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm asking if the chemistry we got is everlasting
If the chemistry we got is everlasting
If this chemistry we got is everlasting
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just asking

Excuse me shawty (ahahahah!)
