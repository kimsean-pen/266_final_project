Thunderbolts and nightsticks
Coming out of the sky
Flames overhead
Rain until you cry
My babys on a highway

Come in from the
cold
never going home,
never going home

D for disaster
E for my eyes
A for my anger
D before i die

M for mona
O oh good
O oh good
N for the night
dead moon night

Call me if you need me
Down in new orleans
Cant release the victims
Have you seen what i've seen

In new york city
Don't you cross the line
Guard it from the light, guard it from the light

D for disaster
E for my eyes
A for my anger
D before i die

M for mona
O oh good
O oh good
N for the night
dead moon night

Hazard on the highway
Breaing down slow
They thought she was looking
Now i'm all alone
I'm often abandoned
Won't you take me home
Now i'm all alone, Won't you take me home

D for disaster
E for my eyes
A for my anger
D before i die

M for mona
O oh good
O oh good
N for the night
dead moon night

D for disaster
E for my eyes
A for my anger
D before i die

M for mona
O oh good
O oh good
N for the night
dead moon night
dead moon night
dead moon night...
