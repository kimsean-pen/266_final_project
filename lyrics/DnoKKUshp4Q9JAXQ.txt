I'm counting on my bruises
I'm not counting on myself
I've been reaching out this headache
'Cause I thought it was enough
Never careful of what I'd wish for
Never careful with what I'd say
I was begging for attention
In my sick 'n' twisted way

I could reach the stars

This hope for the hopeless
Now that I know this
You can be the strength to carry on
The voice in the silence
Is crushing the violence
It's giving me a chance to right these wrongs
I will never quit, this is it
'Cause it's hope for the hopeless

Hope for the hopeless

I'm sitting in the shadows
As the bodies hit the floor
And I don't need another reason
Why I can't take anymore
I'm so sick of these excuses
Tired of living in the dark
And I won't be another victim
Starving from an empty heart

I'll rise to reach the stars

This hope for the hopeless
Now that I know this
You can be the strength to carry on
The voice in the silence
Is crushing the violence
It's giving me a chance to right these wrongs
I would never quit, this is it
'Cause it's hope for the hopeless

I won't suffocate in vain
I won't die in apathy
I stood out on the edge
And faced eternally
So freedom in the fall
When I'm fallen I believe
I'll never be alone

This hope for the hopeless
Now that I know this
You can be the strength to carry on
The voice in the silence
Is crushing the violence
It's giving me a chance to right these wrongs
I would never quit, this is it
'Cause it's hope for the hopeless
Hope for the hopeless
