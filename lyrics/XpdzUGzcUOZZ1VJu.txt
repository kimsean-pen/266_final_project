U ready
Naw... U ain't ready (no you aint ready)
I mean ready for us.

U know u want me like a new pair of shoes

This could be us
But u b playin'
This could be us
But u keep on foolin' around
Ure the cage to me dove
I'm just saying ...
Forever and ever in love...
Oh baby yeah, this could be us.

U know u want me like a new pair of shoes

This could be... us
This could be us

U... u say u ain't ready
Ready to go steady
Ain't ready for 'us' (no)
Cuz what I got make u weak in in the knees
Take your energy (oh baby)
make u sleep for a week
Sex with me ain't enough
That's why we gotta do it metaphysically

This could be... us
This could be us
This could be... us
This could be us

I... I know ure loving your freedom
Cuz yo freedom (freedom) is payin' yo bills, oh funky dolla
Yes it is
Boyfriends, u think u don't need 'em
But in the middle of the cold, cold night
I think u will, sho' u right

This could be us "yes"
But u b playin' (oh yeah...)
This could be us (you sho' nuff could be)
But u keep on foolin' around

We... we come up on a crossroad
And we got to decide (deside)
Which way to turn,
which way "yes" which way to turn
Are we gonna go (Are we gonna go) Go (Are we gonna)
Over the bridge... Over the bridge (Over the bridge)
before, before it burns
Don't u let it burn, let it burn, baby

This could be... us
This could be us (oh yeah)
This could be... us
Oh u gotta stop playing' baby

Everybody knows, everybody knows
That a woman needs love (L-O-V-E) love
Like a river flow, like a river flow inside
If its good that's all she thinking of
Metaphysical...

Sleep alone if you wanna (nothing mystical...)
But like a new pair of shoes
(after that) U gonna wanna show me off to your friends
(cant beleive my purple psychadelic pimp slap)
When I ...ooooohhh...
This right here. This clould be us

This could be... us
This could be us (oh yeah)
This could be... us
Oh u gotta stop playing' baby

This right here, this could be us
This could be
This could be us (oh yeah)
but you be playing (yes you do now)
This could be us (honey, honey, honey)
But u keep on foolin' around
See that Ure the cage to me dove yes
I'm just saying (I'm just saying)
Forever and ever in love
Oh Baby yeah, this could be us.

This could be... us
This could be us
This could be (This could be us)...us

This could be us

This could be us

Can't u see it baby
Ure the cage to my dove
Only one I been dreaming of
Forever and ever in love
Ohh baby yeah, This could, this could be.
this could be us

But u don't... have... Time... for... me... no... more.
