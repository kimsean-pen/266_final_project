Unchain the colors before my eyes
Yesterdays sorrows, tomorrows white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from, out of the fire

Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
flickers above us, to light up the sky

Unchain the colors before my eyes
Yesterdays sorrows, tomorrows white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the fire
Oh no
Oh, yeah
