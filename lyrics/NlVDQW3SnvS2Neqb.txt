I'm losing time again
trying to figure out who I am
Here's a rope, let's see if I will sink or swim
I'm losing time again
trying to figure out who I am
Here's a rope, let's see if I will sink or swim
I'm losing time again
trying to figure out who I am
Here's a rope, let's see if I will sink or swim
I quit my job again
To try to figure out if this life
Is a life I want to live
I'm losing time again
trying to figure out who I am
Here's a rope, let's see if I will sink or swim
