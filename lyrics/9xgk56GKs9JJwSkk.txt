Deep beneath my skin I felt the change
of pace as all the walls began to spin
I said I wasn't sure,
theres a lot I never say because it just gets in the way of
me and any bit of work that I might have found myself to gain.
Deceased.
Switched up, don't wait up,
I'm sick and tired of this bad luck wont let up
I'm pushing daises just to slow down and not drown my feet
are kicking but it's no use I'm seduced by my own self abuse
Kept loosely tied I'm looking for what I can't find
even though it's hung in front of my eyes for this long
I'm too busy looking in the places that I'll never belong,
dead wrong, losing out on the win because I've been headstrong
Switched up, don't wait up,
I'm sick and tired of this bad luck won't let up
I'm pushing daises just to slow down and not drown my feet
are kicking but it's no use I'm seduced by my own self abuse
I'm feeling switched up don't wait up I'm sick and tired of this bad
luck wont let up I'm pushing daises just to slow down and not drown
my feet are kicking but it's no use I'm seduced by my own self abuse
