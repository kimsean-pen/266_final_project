I am drifting away
I've counted my last days
Between my lips a silent cry

I swore to the Gods
I will let grace win

The battle of my heart
The battle of my heart

I cry for angels to save me
Take the devil in me
Take the devil in me

Save me for I've been mistaken
Save one moment of my life
Take the devil in me
Take the devil in me

A mind at peace with every spirit
Before I leave I shall forgive

I cry for angels to save me
Take the devil in me
Take the devil in me

Save me for I've been mistaken
Save one moment of my life
Take the devil in me

My heart stops beating
It makes me see how bright life could have been

I cry for angels to save me
Take the devil in me
Take the devil in me

Save me for I've been mistaken
Save one moment of my life
Take the devil in me
Take the devil in me
Take the devil in me
Take the devil in me
