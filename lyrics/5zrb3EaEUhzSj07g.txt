Crow Jane; Crow Jane;
Crow Jane; Crow Jane;
Crow Jane, ah-hah-huh

What horrors in her head
That her tongue dare not name
She lives lone by the river,
The rolling rivers of pain
Crow Jane; Crow Jane;
Crow Jane, ah-hah-huh

There is one shining eye on a hard-hat
The company closed down the mine
Winking on the waters they came
Were twenty hard-hats and twenty eyes
In her clapboard shack â€” bare,
Only six foot by five
Ah well they killed a little whiskey here
And poured their pistols dry
Crow Jane; Crow Jane;
Crow Crow Jane, ah-hah-huh

Seems you've remembered
How to sleep, how to sleep
Your house dogs are in the turnips
And your yard dogs are running all over the street
Crow Jane; Crow Jane;
Ah, Crow Jane, ah-hah-huh

O Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson
Why you close up shop so late?
We just fitted out a girl who looked like a bird
Measured .32, .44, .38
I asked the girl which road she was taking
She said she's walking the road of hate
But she hopped on a coal-trolley up to New Town,
Population: 48
Crow Jane; Crow Jane;
Crow Crow Jane, ah-hah-huh

Your guns are drunk and smokin'
They followed you right back to your gate
Laughing all the way home from the new town
Population, now: 28
Crow Jane; Crow Jane;
Ah, Crow Jane, ah-hah-huh
