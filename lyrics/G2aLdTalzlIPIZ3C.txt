Innocent child, how you thought you knew me
Understood my ways, my dark needs
The hunt is not the thrill I'm after
I want the kill, the conquest
To be your master
Wrap your arms around my pale skin
It's too late to back out, you're in
On your knees and praise your new Lord
Deeper now, and here's your reward

Take me to bed and rip me apart
Take me to bed and rip me apart
Take me to bed and rip me apart
Take me to bed and rip me apart

Close your eyes, open your mind
Who do you blame? You're not the only one
On your knees, who do you please?
Who do you feed until I find a better one?
