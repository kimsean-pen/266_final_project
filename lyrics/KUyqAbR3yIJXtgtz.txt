When it is dark
Keep it round
Hold on to it, let the light go out
This is you, forever
This is you, forever

Feel the cigarette
Feel your mouth
Feel the gutter running wild
It's a good sound
Spirit locked the door
Left you in a proper daze

If you're anxious
If you're worn
If you're keeping to yourself
On the telephone
This is you, forever
This is you, forever

Alligator
Don't you hate it
'Cause there's no other way around

Cause this is you, forever
This is you, forever

Always
