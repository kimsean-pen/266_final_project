Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon
We are shakin' the tree
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon
We are shakin' the tree

Waiting your time
Dreaming of a better life
Waiting your time
You're more than just a wife
You don't want to do what your mother has done
She has done
This is your life
This new life has begun
It's your day
A woman's day
It's your day
A woman's day

Turning the tide
You are on the incoming wave
Turning the tide
You know you are nobody's slave

Find your sisters or brothers who can hear all the truth in what you say
They can support you when you're on your way

It's your day
A woman's day
It's your day
A woman's day

We are shakin' the tree
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon
We are shakin' the tree

Changing your ways
Changing those surrounding you
Changing your ways
More than any man can do
Open your heart
Show him the anger and pain, so you heal
Maybe he's looking for his womanly side
Let him feel

You had to be so strong
And you do nothing wrong
Nothing wrong at all
We're gonna to break it down
We have to shake it down
Shake it all around
