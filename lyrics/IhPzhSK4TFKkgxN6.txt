There was a time when all the shadows of these tall buildings
Would throw their cape around each corner of the grassy fields
And one by one, each huge shade would cover the green with black
Allowing changes that we could not have foreseen

Everybody let us gaze upon the world we created
And let's rest our eyes upon the great machine as we wave goodbye
Feel the evening breeze caress us while the cities are dying
As we watch it fall into a modern state, a modern time

Remember when we'd hear the distant sound of human life
A zillion noises whimper as they travel through the sky
And one by one, each little sound has faded away with time
Allowing changes that we could not have foreseen

Everybody let us say goodbye to all our notions
'Cause it's not enough to say that we're humane when we're left behind
It's too late to think that we can worship human emotions
'Cause we've already evolved into machines in our minds.
