I lay at night and wonder how long
I'll live feeling this way
Because countless days have come and gone by
And not a thing has changed
I still haven't seen
You when you're smiling
In way too long
It's been way too long

You say that I'm not there but you could fall apart
And I'd pick up the pieces
And I'd tell you even though it's hard
You're all that I believe in
So here I'll stay, and I'll wait until you come back
You left me waiting, just left me waiting

And now I'll watch the time fly by

Maybe I believe
That you'll return with the changing leaves
And help me finally put to rest this aching in my head
Nothing can relieve the empty feeling inside of me
Come home tonight, come home tonight
It'll be alright if you just come home tonight
