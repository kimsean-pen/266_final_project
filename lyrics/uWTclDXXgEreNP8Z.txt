Hey everybody
Where did mary go?
Where did mary go?
And where's my only cigarette?
Please think for me I can't bare to...
I'll just lie here for a while
wet myself
wet my bed
I readied it all for her
ya know.
Clean sheets
insense
and lot's of fluffy
pillows
now soiled.
And where's my cigarette?
Did you check the bathroom?
The bathtub?
She sleeps there sometimes
water cleanses you know
washes dirt away
makes new.
Maybe she
Maybe she
Maybe she sw...
Maybe sh...
Maybe she swam away...
Ok, alright, now what?
