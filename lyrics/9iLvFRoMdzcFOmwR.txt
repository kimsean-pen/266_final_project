Went to a doctor, said I look so hard
And with a smile on his face but him into a junkyard
Look for an answer in empty doorways
Talk to a dancer, said it's out on the highway

Well come on doctor, won't you gimme a shot
I'm feeling cold boy, feeling hot
Doctor said no boy you gotta learn
First don't shoot up and then it's your turn

Well anything could happen
And it could be right now
And the choice is yours
To make it worthwhile
Anything could happen
And it could be right now
And the choice is yours
So make it worthwhile

Make the cancellation and I got numb
I haven't the motivation to get myself a gun
Look for an answer in empty doorways
Talk to a dancer, said it's out on the highway

Well here I am in the big city
I got no heart and I got no pity
Can't you see I'm on the run
Can't you see I'm not having any fun

Anything could happen
And it could be right now
And the choice is yours
To make it worthwhile
Anything could happen
And it could be right now
And the choice is yours
So make it worthwhile
