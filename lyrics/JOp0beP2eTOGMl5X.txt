Well, if dancing is a revolution
Grab the kids, grab the neighbors alike
If I had a gun for every time we spoke
I could arm the whole world and take it for ransom
Dare not would you ask of me

We cannot delete it just because of the trend
Tossed about by the waves of the sea
Cannot delete it just because of the fight that is here
When we say it, we mean it

Cannot delete it, we are not here
'Cause coat tails rain before the love
Cannot delete it just because of the truth
That rains and shakes inside
