Hold on to the colour in your day

I will always be around
To reach your pain

Home is where
You don't have to carry all of the worry
You don't have to bury all of the memories

Hold on love
Hold on love
Hold on love
Hold on love
Hold on love
Hold on to
Each other when you can

Time will always come around
To meet you with the answers
Home is in your body
Homebody
