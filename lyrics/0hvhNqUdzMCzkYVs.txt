Hey, hey
Damn

One foot in the club, everybody watch me
One pop of the booty, everybody love me
Ain't the reason I'm cocky
I make myself feel sexy
Fan of myself, I'm stanning myself
I love me so much I put my hands on myself
Fan of myself, I'm stanning myself
I love me so much I put my hands on myself

Man, I feel like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, Queen of Hearts, yeah
Tonight it's only me that matters
Oh, you on that feminist tip?
Hell yeah, I am!

I don't need a man
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can ('cause I can)
I don't want your cash
I put my own rock on my hand
I put my own rock on my hand
I put my own rock on my hand (what?)
I don't need a man (uh, uh)
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can

Make way for the G-O, double D, E-S-S-S
I spare no enemies in this dress
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I make myself feel sexy
Fan of myself, I'm stanning myself
I love me so much I put my hands on myself
Fan of myself, I'm stanning myself
I love me so much, can't keep my hands off myself

Man, I feel like Cleopatra
Joan of Arc, Queen of Hearts, yeah
Tonight it's only me that matters
Oh, you on that feminist tip?
Hell yeah, I am!

I don't need a man (uh-huh)
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can

Yeah one-one, take control
Drop your man down like you don't want him no more
Say two-two, freak the floor
Drop it so low that your thighs get sore
Say one-one, take control
Drop your man down like you don't want him no more
Say two-two, freak the floor
Drop it so low that your thighs get sore
