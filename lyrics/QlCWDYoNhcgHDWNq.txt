Walk around
Waste another mile now

Waste another mile now

You'll feel the need
There's no way to return

You'll feel the need
Oh yeah, it burns

What a ride
Hot love on a platter

Give it my friend
Give me good good times around the bend

On daddy's lawn

Huh uh

Lay me down
To know the break of dawn

You'll feel the heat
There's no way to return

You'll feel the heat
Oh yeah, it burns

Take a prune
Let me be your out-go

Give me that thing
Give it my friend
Give me good good times around the bend

Give it my friend
Give me hot hot love around the bend

I'll stay forever
