I said,
I said 'I love you, yes, now"
Maybe love will hear him say
I thought he'd known loving before
He's so mean to her
If only had he held on
He'd be along side with you so guarded

He really don't care
He hardly there
He really don't care
He really don't care

I've been here
Here with more than he asked from her
And I have got what you needed for your heart
He gave me love
He hit me
He loved you, you know

He really don't care
He hardly there
He really don't care
He really don't care

He really don't care
He hardly there
He really don't care
