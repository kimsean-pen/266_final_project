What did you do?
Got me confused
Spinning, spinning, round and round
Sticky, sticky, off the ground
Slipping til you let me drown
Hate me then you love me now

You got me wondering where this going
Where the phone went, not who I'm in love with
You got me wondering why you roaming
Something to it (why why) but it ain't lil lonely

You know I cannot shake ya
You know I cannot break ya
You only fool me then you lose me
Then right back I take ya
You know we're bad together
You don't want this forever
Then I look stupid, call me foolish
But I'll do whatever

What did you do?
Looking confused
Spinning, spinning, round and round
Sticky, sticky, off the ground
Slipping til you let me drown
Hate me then you love me now

Let's play, let's pretend
I could have my way
What you gonna say
If I ever walk away?
Let's play, let's pretend
You could treat me fair
Maybe you won't scare me
Maybe you would care

You know I'd wait for you
And stay away from you
I'd stick around when things are falling down
I need a reason for me to leave him
Zigzag, circus
I don't know that sticky-icky is the potion
(sticky-icky, sti-sticky-icky)

What did you do? (What did you do?)
Looking confused (Got me confused, I'm confused)
Spinning, spinning, round and round
Sticky, sticky, off the ground
Slipping til you let me drown
Hate me then you love me now
(Why won't you love me now?)
