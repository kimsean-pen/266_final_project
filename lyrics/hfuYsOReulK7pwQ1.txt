It's time to take you home
It feels so early, but I promised I would bring you to your door

(Now our lips are numb)
As we walk, sharing warm alcohol
That kiss tastes like summer

I hope you like the stars I stole for you
One hundred million twinkle lights in neon blue

I'll be the brightest someday
I'll be the brightest someday
I'll be the brightest, you'll see

Don't rain on my parade
(It's gonna glow in the dark)
I like it better when you can't keep warm
Don't ruin a perfect thing, a perfect thing
The boy on the blue moon dreams of sun

Now as the rain falls like shattered pieces of glass from the sky
We bleed like water colours and drunken pastels down the stairways

And I ask myself: "Why do I still pray?
When will it end? And who fucking cares?"

I swear to God, I did what I could
I practically begged you
I pretended everything was fine
A soul sacrifice, an american nightmare
I'd rather be dead

Don't rain on my parade
(It's gonna glow in the dark)
I like it better when you can't keep warm
Don't ruin a perfect thing, a perfect thing
The boy on the blue moon hears a nightmare in his head

I'll bet you money has you running to the bathroom
You barely started drinking, but your beauty never stopped you
You died in California by the sulfur and the sea
(I guess I never should have loved you)
But I do forever 'cause you loved me

(And I break my glasses as I fall in the street)
If you were gonna leave this world, how could it be without me?
Now it's all over my tongue and it still has no taste
'Cause without you there is no me

(And there's no me at all)
Sometimes love
Love dies like
Dies like a
Love dies like a dog
(So, why don't we just this one take care of itself?)

Don't rain on my parade
(It's gonna glow in the dark)
I like it better when you can't keep warm
Don't ruin a perfect thing, a perfect thing
The boy on the blue moon dreams

Don't rain on my parade
Woah, no
I'm losing a perfect thing
A perfect thing
A perfect thing
