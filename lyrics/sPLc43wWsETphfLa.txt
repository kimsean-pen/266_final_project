Hey hey hey
The sun is over the city but it's an orange day

There is reason for lookin' up but I'm feelin' down
You see, I've got to catch a plane but won't buy a ticket
'Cause its' hard to just stop when you're spinnin' around
It's a weird world, don't you know it?

It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world, no matter how you roll it
Hey hey hey, sweet baby

There's a way
Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love

It's a weird world, yeah
Sent a message to a G.I. in the desert
Said thank you man for bringin' another dawn
Back here it's her and me and we're havin' our first baby

He's out there takin' 'em on
It's a weird world and I know you know it
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world, no matter how you roll it
Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way
Just stand up and fight it

Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love
I'm closin' my eyes but I'm startin' to see
While he's lookin' at you, she's lookin' at me
The only thing it does
Is just keep me away from you

Sure, part of this place would cheer if I die
But don't let them take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way

Just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey, sweet baby
There's a way for you to decide it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out now
Your love
Hey hey hey
(It's a weird world, don't you know it?)
Hey hey hey
(It's a weird world, don't you know it?)
Hey hey hey
(Oh, it's a weird world, don't you know it?)
Hey hey hey
