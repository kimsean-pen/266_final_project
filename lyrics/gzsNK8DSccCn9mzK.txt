The streets are empty, inside it's warm
His hands are shaking, they locked the door
A voice is calling asking to get in

All he wanted was a toy
All he needed was a gentle heart
To lead him through the dark
When his dreams are running wild

Boy and the ghost, fire's not burning
The lights went out, the lights went out

Big family dinner, the untold tale
Their eyes are sparkling on his frozen face
Angel's calling asking to get in

All he wanted was a toy
All he needed was a gentle heart
To lead him through the dark
When there's nowhere left to fall

Boy and the ghost, his eyes are burning
The lights went out, the dream is on

Wake up, wake up, there's an angel in the snow
Look up, look up, it's a frightened dead boy
With so much hate, such bad dreams
He could have seen the toy's the key
But no one saw, no one saw

All he wanted was a toy
All he needed was a bleeding heart
To lead him through the dark
Boy and the ghost
Despero, solitas, debilis, desolo
Despero, solitas, debilis, desolo
When there's nowhere left to fall
Nowhere to hide, his silence is hurting
Inside it's cold, sleep or die
Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
His light went out
