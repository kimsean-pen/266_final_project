All the same in our city here
It's always hot then it is out here
Out in the country we can settle down
Out in the country we can move around

It's music playing down at every bar
Nobody dancing, seems to care at all
Out in the country it ain't no stop
Well, I ain't grooving, I pick up my guitar

I got something wanna say to you
Ain't nothing wrong with nothing to do
I ain't busy and I ain't bored
City looking out of my back door
