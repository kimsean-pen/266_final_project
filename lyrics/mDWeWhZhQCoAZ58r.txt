And you huh
You do huh
We let it in
We give it out
And in the end
What's it all about
It must be love

I give you my
I give you my
You give me your
You give me your joy

We used to say
Ah hell, we're young
But now we see
That life is sad
And so is love
(Ooh ooh baby live your life for love)
(Ooh ooh baby live your life for love)

We used to say
Ah hell, we're young
But now we see
That life is sad
And so is love
(Ooh ooh baby for the sake of love)
(Ooh ooh baby for the sake of love)

And whatever happens
What really matters
It's all we've got
Isn't that enough

(Life is sad and so is love)
You let it slip
You let it slip
(Life is sad and so is love)
I love you more
I love you more for it
(Life is sad and so is love)

(Life is sad and so is love)
All I don't want to
All for love
(Life is sad and so is love)
Just for the sake of love
(Life is sad and so is love)
You set me free, I set you free
(Life is sad and so is love)
