From inside his mouth I lick the blood
But he is roaring and biting
I wash off the mud
Cause the tempest is out to wrestle a while
Stop charging my darling
Come closer, be quiet
Cause when you see a wall
I see a door
Set up with no map
and turn off your torch
When you see a wall
I see a door
You'll get soon
You'll be home
You'll be home

From his mouth
I lick the scars
The woodland believes
marking a path
and if you just rest your head
stop repeating the charge
You'll know that this time
You turn off the logs (? not sure)
Cause when you see a wall
I see a door
Set up with no map
and turn off your torch
When you see a wall
I see a door
You'll get soon
You'll be home
You'll be home

You'll get soon
You'll be home
You'll be home

Just sit still, does it hurt? Does it hurt?
Just sit still, does it hurt? Does it hurt?
Just sit still, does it hurt? Does it hurt?
Just sit still, does it hurt? Does it hurt?

When you see a wall
I see a door
You'll get soon
You'll be home
You'll be home

You'll get soon
You'll be home
You'll be home
