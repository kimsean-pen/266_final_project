There's nothing really left to say
And I don't need you to explain
We don't need those lights
So tired of living in the past
So if we're gonna make it last
We should leave it all behind
I'd rather you lie
Than throw it all away

How deep do you wanna go?
Don't you know that some things
Are better left alone?
How deep do you wanna go?
Don't you know that some things
Are better left alone?

They're better left alone

I think we might of gone to far
Loosing sight of who we are.
How do we get back? (How do we get back?)
To the time where it was so easy
'Cause I need you, and you need me

What happened to that?
I'd rather you lie,
Than throw all that away.
How deep, do you wanna go?

Don't you know that somethings
Are better left alone?
How deep, do you wanna go?

Don't you know that somethings
Are better left alone? (better left alone)
Better left alone.
Better left alone
