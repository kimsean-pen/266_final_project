You do a great impression
Of someone who is
Lost
Well I'm lost too
So let's get lost together

It is a rare perfection
In something that is
Real
Well I see it too
So let's just watch together

And I'll never get up
Never give up (Do you see me?)
And I'll never get up
Never give up (I am here)
Never get up
Never give up
And I'll never get up (Do you know me?)
Never give up
Never get up (Are you there?)
Never give up
Never get up
Never give up

As soon as you stop
That's when you start
As soon as you're not
That's when you are
We rip the clouds down from the sky
And slither down the cracks of the earth

You do a great impression
Of someone who is
Lost
Well I'm lost too
So let's get lost together

And I'll never get up
Never give up (Do you see me?)
And I'll never get up
Never give up (I am here)
Never get up
Never give up
And I'll never get up (Do you know me?)
Never give up
Never get up (Are you there?)
Never give up
Never get up
Never give up

This is only the beginning
A word you cannot speak
It speaks you
This is only the beginning
