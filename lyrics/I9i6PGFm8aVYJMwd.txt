Bring back those good ol' days
Nothing feels right
Nothing ever goes my way
I threw my future away
Now I walk alone
Out here in the cold
Wandering astray
Where's my future
I'm gonna need a home
You'd expect the same
Now wouldn't you
Wouldn't you

Your journey back to birth
Is haunting you
It's haunting you
Your departure from the earth
Is haunting you
It's haunting you

Only those who accept
Will find that acceptance in return
We've been trimmed down like hedges
Told just to sit and wilt
And spit at each other from a distance
With constant resistance from you
I'm gonna need a home
You'd expect the same
Now wouldn't you
Wouldn't you

Your journey back to birth
Is haunting you
It's haunting you
Your departure from the earth
Is haunting you
It's haunting you

It's been ten years strong
That's much too long
It's time to do something good for my health
Time to do something good for myself
It's been ten years strong
That's much too long
It's time to do something good for my health
Time to do something good for myself

I've wasted all this time
I've wasted all this time

Your journey back to birth
Is haunting you
It's haunting you
Your departure from the earth
Is haunting you
It's haunting you

Your journey back to birth
Is haunting you
It's haunting you
Your departure from the earth
Is haunting you
It's haunting you
