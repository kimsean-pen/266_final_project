It must be written that the moon
Elbowed the stars and said,
"Let's do our best to make it hard for them".
Your house turned into paper cranes
We watched the wind blow them away
Some sorry comfort I was then

The weight of a mountain
The skin off your knees
From climbing up to me

We can work this out
I believe, although it seems impossible

They turned our skeletons to wood
And scattered matches underfoot
We must walk carefully in place
The circles darken round our eyes
And yet our bodies, when combined
They gleam like diamonds in a cave

The weight of a mountain
The skin off your knees
From climbing back to me

We can work this out
I believe, although it seems impossible now
Keep the world without
Only the two of us count

Two voices loud
It is possible now
They try to tear us down
We'll find our way again

Heloise gave her whole heart to Pete
Now eternally sleeps by his side
Oh, go ahead, fate, oh, give us your best
What is worth living for is worth a fight
Into the night

We can work this out
I believe, although it seems impossible now
Yeah, without a doubt
We'll work it out
They can't hurt us now
On my knees, it makes me want to scream and shout
Yeah, we'll work this out
Just the two of us
Keep the world without
