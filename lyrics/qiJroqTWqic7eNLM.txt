Storms out on the water
I watch you getting closer
Are you coming home

All these years we've wondered
Trying to break the cycle
All these years of hope

And my heart feels the strain
But it makes me feel like I'm alive again
Sometimes in our lives
We need the pain

So I find some candles
Put out all the anchors
Pull the shadows down

Makes me think about us
All those things that got lost
Still we're holding on

And the storm rushes in
But it makes me feel like I'm alive again
Sometimes in our lives
We need the pain

The wind, the rain, the storm
Will wash us clean again
The wind, the rain, the storm
Will shake us up again
The wind, the rain, the storm
Will make us think again
The wind
And maybe we can start again

Storms out on the water
Sea and sky become one
Are you coming home
