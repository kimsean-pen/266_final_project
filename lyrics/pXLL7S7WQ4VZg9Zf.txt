Battering at battling of every move - knocking down the walls in front of me
Reciting the rites of this evil energy - eliminate the weak with hateful potency
Spirit of negation throughout the centuries
Heart of perpetuation of pure savagery
Gruesome nature - eternety defiled
I've challenged and cursed the invincible to exile
Storming relentless denial - confrontation is my retribution
Resistence against the opposition
The path of defiance leads to inner power
I've inherited thefury of the anger - not to submit to no lord
I'm rebellion against the empire - the sword that thrusts the savior's heart
I'm the revolt of procreation - faithful wrath of damnation
Defiance overcomes submission - strength obliterates the competition
Infamous will to potency - reveal the truth for the hypocrite
Infamous will to power - liars' and cowards' darkest hour
Storming relentless denial - confrontation is my retribution
Resistence against the opposition
The Will to Potency
The Will to Potency
The Will to Potency
