You count 'em one, two, three
You look so cute when you get that mad
You drain the life from me
And it feels
Oh so good

The looks you give are so contagious
The way we move is so outrageous
Just let me in
We're wasting time
Just let me in
Let's make it look right

So stay up and get down
Sleep's just time spent wasting time
So get down, yeah, get down
Let's make it happen all night

You're moving close
My pulse is racing
We're getting close
Yeah, I can taste it
I've never done it quite like this
So slow it down now
Just slow it down

The looks you give are so contagious
The way we move is so outrageous
Just let me in
We're wasting time
Just let me in
Let me in

So stay up and get down
Sleep's just time spent wasting time
So get down, yeah, get down
Let's make it happen all night

You count 'em one, two, three
You look so cute when you get that mad
You drain the life from me
And it feels, oh
Oh so good

You count 'em one, two, three
You look so cute when you get that mad
You drain the life from me
And it feels
Oh so good

So stay up and get down
Sleep's just time spent wasting time
So get down, yeah, get down
Let's make it happen all night

So stay up and get down (So stay up and get down)
Sleep's just time spent wasting time (wasting time)
So get down, yeah, get down (So get down, yeah, get down)
Let's make it happen all night
