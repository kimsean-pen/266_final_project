Took a shot to the chin.
Looks like you just can't win
In this do or die situation.
And it's harder than it seems
To survive, keep alive and make your dreams
Make your dreams all come true.

You gotta, you gotta give it your best shot.
Give it ev'rything you got.
Oh, you gotta hang tough.
Hang tough. Hang tough.

Sometimes love can make you blue.
A heartache made just for you.
But you can't let it bring ya down.
If you should stumble, if you should fall
Pick yourself up off the floor.
Fight for what's right and stand your ground.

You gotta give it your best shot.
Give it ev'rything you got.
Oh, you gotta hang tough.
Hang tough.
When the goin' gets rough.
Hang tough. You got to give it all you've got.
Hang tough. Keep your head above the ground.
Don't you let it get you down.
Oh, you gotta hang tough.
Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh!

You stay locked away inside your room
'Cause you don't know what this world is comin' to.
Hummingbird hums 'cause he don't know the words
And the piper will play 'cause he don't know what to say.
He's a lot like you, yeah. Oh, he's a lot like you, yeah.
He tries hard ev'ry day to be free and fly away. Yeah!

Hang tough, oh, when the goin' gets rough.
Hang tough. You've got to give it all you got.
Hang tough. Keep your head above the ground.
Don't you let it get you down.
Oh, you gotta hang tough.
Hang tough. Oh, you got to give it all you got. You gotta
Hang tough. Don't you let it get you down.
Hang tough. No! Oh, you gotta hang tough.
Hang tough.
Hang tough!
