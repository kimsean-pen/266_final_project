Please, please, please
No more melodies
They lack impact, they're petty
They've been made up already
Please please please
No more maladies
I'm so tired of crying
You'd think I was a siren
But me and everybody's on the sad, same team
And You can hear our sad brains screaming:
Give us something familiar
Something similar
To what we know already
That will keep us steady
Steady,
Steady going nowhere
Please please please
No apologies
At best they buy you time
Till you next step out of line
Please please please
No more remedies
My method is uncertain
It's mess, but it's working

And maybe if you'd wanna try it out
You won't like it so when you're crying out
Give us something familiar
Something similar
To what we know already
That will keep us steady
Steady, steady,
Steady, going nowhere
Please, please, please
No more melodies
They lack impact, they're petty
They've been made up already
Please please please
No more maladies
I'm so tired of crying
You'd think I was a siren
But me and everybody's on the sad, same team
And You can hear our sad brains screaming:
Give us something familiar
Something similar
To what we know already
That will keep us steady
Steady, steady, steady
Steady, going nowhere
