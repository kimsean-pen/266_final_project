(Hook)
Hey mama hey mama listen what I say mama
Don't matter what we go thru we Rollin thru the pain mama
Yea I know they Laughin the way I show love mama
Think I really care imma about to show the world mama

You said Im a blessing an Angel fell from the sky
Thought you couldn't have more kids but look at ya guy
Everyday I fuckin think why my brother had died
I could imagine how you feel when he actually died
All the tears in ya eyes all the question and whys
All the doubts to the Lord when ya praying at night
You said I take the cheese & hide in the closet
Shit even back then I was stacking the cheese
Then they took me at 3 yea ya boy is jus Wildin
How they take me from you huh how they take me from mama
25 years of drama look what it did to me mama
They eatin me alive boy they killing me mama
I couldn't take it no more I just had to get out
Cause I gotta greater purpose trynna figure it out
All the love I be giving but I ain't shit to them now
But you never turned away so jus hear me out

Hey mama hey mama listen what I say mama
Don't matter what we go thru we Rollin thru the pain mama

George best memories when it was jus us three
Six Five Eight where we lived Grand St
George always said is gon be okay
But deep down inside you always felt that pain
Shit made you run away to that drugged out game
And here I fuckin am up in that same place
All this negativity I jus wanna be free
Have my kids, girls kids all livin the dream
I be giving em my heart they don't believe in me momma
I be living out my dream but they don't be seeing it momma
I be givin em love when they don't be needing it momma
Why they always tear me down I don't be seeing it momma
The devil stay creeping tear us down to pieces
But God comes first &; he never gonna leave us
Yea we gotta believe it, when were down and we need him
Same way I'm down & I really need ya

(Hook)
Hey mama hey mama listen what I say mama
Don't matter what we go thru we Rollin thru the pain mama
Yea I know they Laughin the way I show love mama
Think I really care imma about to show the world mama

Your the one that I pray for when I'm laying sleep
