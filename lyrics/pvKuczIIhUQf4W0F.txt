Because we're holding our own in a great big storm
It's a great big storm, and we're holding our own
Holding our own in a great big storm
It's a great big storm, and we're holding our own

I've been lost in this maze
Losing love, losing friends, losing faith
Thinking I'm a ghost, afraid one day you'll find me
Asleep above the stars

I watch my mother cry, father die
Is catching up, I keep the phone by my side
Afraid she'll wake me up to catch the next flight
In time to say goodbye

But sometimes I fall sleep at night to the TV light and it seems
Oh, one day the sun will break into the room

Because we're holding our own in a great big storm
And though we're cutting it close, we won't let go
Oh, no, I can't believe everything falling down around me
But now I'm holding my own, and I won't let go

Holding our own in a great big storm
It's a great big storm, and we're holding our own
Holding our own in a great big storm
It's a great big storm, and we're holding our own

Broken hearts, broken homes and broken bones
Secret love let me go
You know I gotta find my own way
Through mistakes that I can't change

Because there's beauty in every sin, every single black eye
Have some blue like the moon, just before the sun shines
No I don't believe in all the things that they preach

But sometimes I fall sleep at night, and I just know you're smiling at me
Oh, one day I'm gonna make this up to you

Because we're holding our own in a great big storm
And though we're cutting it close, we won't let go
Oh, no, I can't believe everything falling down around me
But now I'm holding my own, and I won't let go

Holding our own in a great big storm
It's a great big storm, and we're holding our own
Holding our own in a great big storm
It's a great big storm, and we're holding our own (And I can't stand myself)

And all the curse words that fall from my mouth
I can't stand myself

Or my legs as they run from the ones here to help
But I just woke up with you next to me
Some new air to breathe
And a belief that it's all gonna be alright

And I can't stand myself, whoa
But it's high time that we gave it a try
And I think I'm gonna finally give myself a new try

Because I'm holding my own, yeah, in this great big storm
And though I'm cutting you close, oh, we won't let go
No, I can't believe everything falling down around me
But now we're holding our own, and we won't let go

No, we won't let go
No, we won't let go, oh, no
