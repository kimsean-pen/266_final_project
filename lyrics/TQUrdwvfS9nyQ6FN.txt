All those crazy nights when I cried myself to sleep .
Now melodrama never makes me weep anymore
'cause I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you

You showed me how, how to leave myself behind
How to turn down the noise in my mind
Now I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain

I haven't the need for the pain

Not since I've known you
I haven't got time for the pain (the pain)
I haven't got room for the pain (the pain)

I haven't the need for the pain

Suffering was the only thing
that made me feel I was alive
Thought that's just how much it cost
to survive in this world
'til you showed me how,
how to fill my heart with love
How to open up and drink
in all that white light
Pouring down from the heaven
Haven't got time for the pain (the pain)
I haven't got room for the pain (the pain)
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you
I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room or the need for the pain
No I haven't the need for the pain
No, I haven't got time
No I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain No, No, No
I haven't got need for the pain No, No, No
I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
The time for the pain is over
