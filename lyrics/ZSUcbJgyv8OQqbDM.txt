Like Lucifer I grew my horns, when I rejected paradise
Damn myself to a life of thorns, then maybe i'd call it even
Not deserving of that life
Bury myself under the smog
Masochistic life of pain

My betrayer
Born with sin
Yours and his

Your god is dead
We have killed him
Just for the sake
Of our selfish thoughts

Everyone born with a sin
It's yours and his
His only son
Punish myself for existing

Create a hell around me
Torture my body
With anything I can find
Close the door behind me
