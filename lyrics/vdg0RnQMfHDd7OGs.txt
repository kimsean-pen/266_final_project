I tried to forget
And every time I do
Comes a motorcycle sound
That reminds me of you

I tried to forget
And every time I do
Comes a motorcycle sound
That reminds me of you

I tried to forget
And every time I do
Comes a motorcycle sound
That reminds me of you
There are so many things I want to say (to say)

I still remember the night I first met you
You were so different
How could I forget you?
I bet you're happy now that you broke me down
That's all over now

By the time I sing this song
You'll be out of my head and gone
(that's all, that's all, that's all over now)
Feel like I panic and I'm ready to fear
I feel nothing when I think of you

(That's all, that's all)

I tried to forget
And every time I do
Comes a motorcycle sound
That reminds me of you
I tried to forget
And every time I do
Comes a motorcycle sound
That reminds me of you

I bet you're happy now that you broke me down
That's all over now

By the time I sing this song
You'll be out of my head and gone
(that's all, that's all, that's all over now)
Feel like I panic and I'm ready to fear
I feel nothing when I think of you
I feel nothing
By the time I sing this song
You'll be out of my head and gone
(that's all, that's all, that's all over now)
Feel like I panic and I'm ready to fear
I feel nothing when I think of you
I feel nothing
