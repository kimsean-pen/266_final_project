You can sleep-walk back and find me
Another symphony in session
Walkin' today for the people
Watch the smoke rise behind me

Isn't that my right
When to breathe to my own guilt
It's so hard anyway as it is
Joker's wild, laughin' back
But I nave to stay

Cut you loose, cut you up
Cut me free, cut me up
I wanna choose my own day
Let me go, call me now
Black Monday

Another black Monday came to stab me up
We stood up, I stand up
Empty promised land, we dressed it up
A womaner, we messed it up

Liar sleep-walk back to find me
Just turnin' up, I'm outta luck
Watch the fires rise behind me
We sew it up, it's gotta stop

Isn't that my right
When to breathe to my own guilt
It's so hard anyway as it is
Joker's wild, laughin' back
But I nave to stay

Cut you loose, cut you up
Cut me free, cut me up
I wanna choose my own day
Let me go, call me now
Black Monday

Back in the black alley never thought I'd see the day
It's throwback time and comin' just like yesterday
Here's my body, not my own, I still have to pay
Give it all away

Dressin' up clean, me looking sharp
Coat hangin' white and wear me out
Hangin' out, bleedin' out
Soul-searchin' notes

For all the people that stood beside me
I had some men that felt just like me

Isn't that my right
When to breathe to my own guilt
It's so hard anyway as it is
Joker's wild, laughin' back
But I nave to stay

Cut you loose, cut you up
Cut me free, cut me up
I wanna choose my own day
Let me go, call me now
Black Monday

(Isn't that, to breathe)
We'll never let go
(To my own, it's so hard anyway)
We'll never let go
(As it is, joker's wild)
I'll never let go
(Laughin' back, but I have to stay)
Never let go

(Cut you loose, cut you up, cut me free)
We'll never let go
(Cut me up, I wanna choose my own way)
We'll never let go
I'll never let go
We'll never let go
(Black Monday)
