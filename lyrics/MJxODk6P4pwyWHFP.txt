Lord above, why don't you tell me
Why I'm here in agony?
I've been serving, I've been praying
Now I'm caught in misery
I've been praised by friar Jakob
I misused his confidence
Cheated by this work of evil
Feigning Anna's innocence

Oh, what have I done?
So many ways lead to the fallen one
Lucifer, fallen light
Oh, what have I done?
What is going on?

Reach out for the light
Far beyond confines
You have read the magic lines
Leading to the light in your mind

What is right and what is wrong now?
Is it a trial of paradise?
Is Anna a witch or do they stick to an error?
What's the book and the seal inside?
Am I a cleric or maybe a sinner?
Unbeliever? Renegade?
Was it the devil who led me to seven?
Oh redeemer is it all too late?

Oh, what have I done?
I have been led by the smelling one
Lucifer, fallen light
Tell me stranger, what have I done?
Oh, what's going on?

Reach out for the light
Far beyond confines
You have read the magic lines
Leading to the light in your mind

Reach out for the light
Far beyond confines
You have read the magic lines
Leading to the light

Reach out for the light
Far beyond confines
You have read the magic lines
Leading to the light in your mind
