You will you won't, you do you don't
You're sayin' you will but you know you won't
You may you might, your chest gets tight
You say you love day but you come out at night

While your thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' up a storm in you
All the things you're thinkin' are they false, are they true
You know the dipsydoodle rag, it tells no lie
But all the time you're thinkin', well you're trickin' your mind

Well you will you won't, you do you don't
You're sayin' you will but you know you won't
You may you might, your chest gets tight
You say you love day but you come out at night

Well the devil's standin' tall on the top of the hill
Pointin' down his fork and betrayin' your will
You gotta make decisions whether old or new
Then God comes from the Heavens and he'll say to you

Well you will you won't, you do you don't
You're sayin' you will but you know you won't
You may you might, your chest gets tight
You say you love day but you come out at night

Well I've tried so hard, I've tried so hard
To make it right, to make it right
I'm gonna bury my thoughts
And forget all my worries tonight

You will you won't, you do you don't
You're sayin' you will but you know you won't
You may you might, your chest gets tight
You say you love day but you come out at night

Well, you will you won't, you do you don't
You're sayin' you will but you know you won't
You may you might, your chest gets tight
You say you love day but you come out at night
