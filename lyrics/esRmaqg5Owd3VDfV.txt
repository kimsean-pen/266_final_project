If I could change, I'd change what's mine to change
Give me a sign and I'll jump from the heights
and they can wonder why
I fell down and died
Give me a sign and I'll jump to the sky
give me a sign and no one asks you why
you still loved me
or why am I still here,
the morning comes turning to a day
and I'll be colors in the.

Rainbow world
You'll find out it changes you
Rainbow world
you'll find out how strange it is
In the Rainbow world
You'll be the foam on the sea
It's a rainbow, It's a rainbow world for me

Rainbow world!
You fantasized about the dark,
and let the evil light its spark
give me a sign and I'll jump to the sky
give me a sign and no one asks you
why did it become real,
and why am I still here!

Rainbow world
You'll find out it changes you
Rainbow world you'll find out how strange it is
In the Rainbow world
You'll be the foam on the sea
It's a rainbow, it's my final fall and the afterglow!

At the brake of dawn
The Cliffhanger falls
At the brake of dawn
The Cliffhanger falls

Rainbow world
You'll find out it changes you
Rainbow world
you'll find out how strange it is
In the Rainbow world
You'll be the foam on the sea
It's a rainbow, It's a rainbow world
It's a rainbow world, a rainbow world
it's my final fall
Rainbow world
You'll be the foam on the sea
It's a rainbow
it's my final fall and the afterglow!
