I'm a long gone Waylon song gone by
I'm a backroads sinner at a tent revival
She believes in me like she believes her bible
And loves me like Jesus does
I'm a left foot leaning on a suped up Chevy
I'm a good ol' boy, drinking whiskey and rye on the levee
But she carries me, when my sins make me heavy
And loves me like Jesus does
All the crazy in my dreams
Both my broken wings
Every single piece of everything I am
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
And the devil man, he don't stand a chance
'Cause she loves me like Jesus does
Always thought she'd give up on me one day
Wash her hands of me, leave me staring down some runway
But I thank God each night, and twice on Sunday
She loves me like Jesus does
All the crazy in my dreams
Both my broken wings
Every single piece of who I am
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
And the devil man, no, he don't have a prey
'Cause she loves me like Jesus does
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
That devil man, he don't stand a chance
'Cause she loves me like Jesus does.
I'm a long gone Waylon song, gone by
