We learn
From our mistakes
Take shelter
From the burning sun
Time won't heal you
It hurts to let go but you know...

That you're bleeding out
Listening to everyone
Who's got something to say
And it makes no difference
If you're gonna be, this way

I know we're all grown up
And we should know better than to lead ourselves on
The lights are on but nobody's home
You couldn't tell me that i'm wrong

And I
Wanna be
Free from this
