Does your arm reach?
Where there's blood there's always bone
You say you won't harm me
Where there's lost there's always home
For this one babe, it's all the same, sea above
Pace yourself
This one babe, it's all the same, to me now
Erase yourself

What are you saying?
Like we're losing our control
What are you saying?
Please, please put down the phone

And it's not real speech
Messy moments on your face
Am I misinterpreting?
Listen up, you better brace yourself
For this one babe, it's all the same, sea above
Pace yourself
This one babe, it's all the same, to me now
Behave yourself

What are you saying?
Like we're losing our control
What are you saying?
Like it's keeping us afloat
What are you saying?
Like there's nowhere left to go
What are you saying?
Please, please pick up the phone

For this one babe, it's all the same, sea above
Behave your
Erase your
Pace yourself

What are you saying?
Like we're losing our control
Losing our control
What are you saying?
Like it's keeping us afloat
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
Like there's nowhere left to go
Nowhere to go
What the hell are you
What are you saying?
Please, please pick up the phone
Oh, won't you please, please pick up the phone
