Once upon a time
I swore I had a heart
Long before the world I know tore it all apart
Once upon a time there was a part of me I shared
Years before they took away the part of me that cared

I've been a thousand places
And shook a million hands
I don't know where I'm goin'
But I know just where I've been
I've flown a million miles
And I've rode so many more
Everyday a castaway, a vagabond, battle born
I'm battle born

Once upon a time I had an open point of view
But that was just so long ago before I had a clue
Was there such a time where I didn't stand alone
Was there ever time
And how would I have known

I've been a thousand places
And shook a million hands
I don't know where I'm goin'
But I know just where I've been
I've flown a million miles
And I've rode so many more
Everyday a castaway, a vagabond, battle born
