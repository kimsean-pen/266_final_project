Get out in that kitchen
And rattle those pots and pans
Get out in that kitchen
And rattle those pots and pans
Well, roll my breakfast
'Cause I'm a hungry man

I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
Well, you'll never do nothin'
To save your doggone soul

Wearin' those dresses
Your hair done up so nice
Wearin' those dresses
Your hair done up so nice
You look so warm
But your heart is cold as ice

I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
Well, you'll never do nothin'
To save your doggone soul

(Go)
(Go)
(Go)
(Go)
(Go)

I'm like a one-eyed cat
Peepin' in a sea food store
I'm like a one-eyed cat
Peepin' in a sea food store
I can look at you
Tell you don't love me no more

I believe you're doin' me wrong
And now I know
I believe you're doin' me wrong
And now I know
The more I work
The faster my money go

I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
Well, you'll never do nothin'
To save your doggone soul

(Shake, rattle and roll)
