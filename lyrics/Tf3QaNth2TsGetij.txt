I want someone
To remind me to wear sunscreen
And take my vitamins when it slips my mind
I want someone
Who knows how I like my coffee
And wants to share a bed from morning to night

But I'm stubborn
Selfish
Easily jealous at times
I'm hard to love
And I just want someone
To try

I want someone
Who knows that I'm not made for mornings
And doesn't scold me for smoking when I drink
I want someone
Who listens when they've heard the story
And gives me enough space to breathe

Coz I'm stubborn
Selfish
And easily jealous at times
I'm hard to love
And I just want someone
To try
To try

I want someone
Who can ground me when I'm too high
Light up the dark side of my head
I want someone
To share my coffee and sunscreen
My mornings, my stories, and my bed

Someone stubborn
Selfish
And easily jealous would be fine
I won't mind
If they're hard to love
I just want someone
To try
