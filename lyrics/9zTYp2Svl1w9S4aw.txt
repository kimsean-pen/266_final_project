Contrary to the matter
Who you are
You are not
Come with me

I'll show you Saturn
Planets don't quite align
You should try not to be so courageous
I never said you were a mistake at all

You got it all wrong
You're misunderstanding
I never said you were a mistake at all
You got it all wrong

You're misunderstanding
Traveled far for this lover
Who she was she was not
But honestly it don't matter

Aliens ain't farmers
You should try not to be so courageous
I never said you were a mistake at all
You got it all wrong

You're misunderstanding
I never said you were a mistake at all
You got it all wrong
You're misunderstanding

I never said you were
I never said you were
You got it all wrong
You got it all wrong

I never said you were
You got it all wrong
You should try not
To be so courageous

Remind me
This dismal moods have become contagious
Remind me
You should try not to be so courageous

I never said you were a mistake at all
You got it all wrong
You're misunderstanding
I never said you were a mistake at all

You got it all wrong
You're misunderstanding
I never said you were
You got it all wrong
