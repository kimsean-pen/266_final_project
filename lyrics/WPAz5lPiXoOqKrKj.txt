This used to be my playground

This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end?
And why do they always say?
Don't look back
Keep your head held high
Don't ask them why because life is short

And before you know you're feeling old and your heart is breaking
Don't hold on to the past
Well that's too much to ask
This used to be my playground (ah used to be)
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end?
And why do they always say?
Live and learn

Well the years they flew and we never knew we were foolish then

We would never tire and that little fire is still alive in me
It will never go away
Can't say goodbye to yesterday
(can't say goodbye)
This used to be my playground
(ru-a-a-h used to be)
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end?
And why do they always say?

No regrets

But I wish that you were here with me well then there's hope yet
I can see your face in our secret place
You're not just a memory
Say goodbye to yesterday
(the dream)
Those are words I'll never say
(I'll never say... ru-a-a-h)
This used to be my playground (used to be)
This used to be our pride and joy

This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy
This used to be our playground (used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream

This used to be the place we ran to

I wish you were standing here with me
(ru-a-a-h)
This used to be our playground (used to be)
This used to be our great escape
This used to be the place we ran to
This used to be our secret hiding place
(hiding place)
This used to be our playground (used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free...
Wishing you were here with me...
