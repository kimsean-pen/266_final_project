I got a new girl and she's foreign
When the sun goes down, mami never get's bored
She coming with me when I'm touring
In every city we step, mami riding like she's from there
Like she's foreign, she rides me like she's foreign
Like she's from there, she rides me different always
Like she's foreign, she rides me like she's foreign
Like she's from there, she rides me different always

I got a new girl from the bay
She knows my name, but she lotta call me "bae", hey
She rides me dirty in L.A
But she's on her mami shit when we came back to Spain
Mi chica no es de por aquí
Ella es blanca como Europa, pussy como Medellín, llín
Estuvo de party por París
Y me lo estuvo dando todo cuando estabamos en Berlín, aye
Hold on wait a minute (hold on, wait a minute, what up?) oh
Maybe have you seen my girl around this spot, aye
She was making business (Duh, she was right there)
I don't know the fuck she doing, where the shooters at? aye
You know baby all the money I'mma spend it all with you
Y todas esas que hatean en verdad quieren ser como tú
So baby, baby lemme get high, lemme flex on you
Estamos siempre,
siempre haciendo money, ya quisieran hacer tanto flush

I got a new girl and she's foreign
When the sun goes down, mami never get's bored
She coming with me when I'm touring
In every city we step, mami riding like she's from there
Like she's foreign, she rides me like she's foreign
Like she's from there, she rides me different always
Like she's foreign, she rides me like she's foreign
Like she's from there, she rides me different always

C'mon baby pull up, that she pull up so hard
Oh she's driving me crazy, and she ain't even have a car
I don't know why everybody want her even haters getting mad
But she loves me so good, she knows Keo getting guap
Estamos cashin', estamos cashin'
Estamos haciendo pila, manin' te lo juro
Y todo eso vale mierda si me paso una noche sin tu culo
Si tú eres mía, tú eres mía, sólo mia, mami yo eso te lo juro
Y sabes que como yo te lo hago por aquí no lo va a hacer ninguno,
alguien
I'm in clean money like a jeweler
Soon I'mma 'come a jeweler
Now screaming Hallelujah
Now we got money pretty like shooter
We are the party twistin', vaya lío
Citas sin sexy pussy like a río
'Tá tan caliente, siempre tiene frío
Quiere cariño, quiere estar conmigo
Stay on my lane, tell up, stay on my lane
I get money in all different ways, stay on the flame
My chica, yo soy from the flame
The pussy got all different tastes
She's like the queen, she's like the promethazine
Every time I fuck her, I get high like is Lean
I see you purple, I love the codeine
I see you purple, that pussy is codeine

I got a new girl and she's foreign
When the sun goes down, mami never get's bored
She coming with me when I'm touring
In every city we step, mami riding like she's from there
Like she's foreign, she rides me like she's foreign
Like she's from there, she rides me different always
Like she's foreign, she rides me like she's foreign
Like she's from there, she rides me different always
