I've been asking what is new, like my streetwise buddy do
Body talk seems big with him, so it's conversations in the gym

Ooh enchanted ooh enchanted

"Pray Forsooth" and "I Adore" ain't the ticket anymore
So how'd you recognise a king? You ask yourself can that cat swing

It's time to learn tiger stretch tiger burn
Ooh enchanted
And the calendar pages blew
Like the Montagues, like the Capulet crew
Ooh enchanted
We're addicted to friction too

Comin' down the years, plain enchantment
That's the glue that binds and bonds
The dying to the new, plain enchantment
Ain't no purple rain quite like it

Here's something to dwell upon
Now we're living next we're gone, so if you've love please pass it on
'Cos it's a disbelieving world, but sensitive as any girl

It's time to learn tiger stretch tiger burn
Ooh enchanted
And the calendar pages blew
Like the Montagues, like the Capulet crew
Ooh enchanted
We're addicted to friction too

It's time to learn tiger stretch tiger burn
Ooh enchanted
And the calendar pages blew
Like the Montagues, like the Capulet crew
Ooh enchanted
We're addicted to friction too

Ooh enchanted now we're living!
