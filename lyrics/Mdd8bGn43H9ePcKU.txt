In a way it's all a matter of time
I will not worry for you
You'll be just fine
Take my thoughts with you and when you look behind
You will surely see a face that you recognize

You're not alone
I'll wait till the end of time
Open your mind
Surely it's plain to see
You're not alone
I'll wait till the end of time for you
Open your mind
Surely there's time to be with me

It is the distance that makes life a little hard
Two minds that once were close
Now so many miles apart
I will not falter though
I'll hold on till you're home
Safely back where you belong and see how our love has grown

You're not alone
I'll wait till the end of time
Open your mind
Surely it's plain to see
You're not alone I'll wait till the end of time for you
Open your mind
Surely there's time to be with me

You're not alone
Surely there's time to be with me
Open your mind yeahhhh

You're not alone I'll wait till the end of time for you
Open your mind, open your mind
You're not alone
