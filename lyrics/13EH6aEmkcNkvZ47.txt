I start it up, turn it over
Like a general motor
And come down heavy cause I drop it
Like a Tomahawk chopper
Gotta keep on doing what I'm doing
Cause we're clapping our hands now
I found a lipstick that I like
And so I'm walking it downtown
Downtown
But I only live in this city
Live in the city
I only live in this city
Live in the city
I like to keep the place busy
And I do it for free
Cause this city can't live without me
Can't live without
Me and my gang and some blind defender
We wind it up around the centre
Roll it over to Camden
Just so you know that queen with the face
That you call my little pony
We basically invented this place
That's why it's standing room only
Standing room only
But I only live in this city
Live in the city
I only live in this city

Live in the city
I like to keep the place busy
And I do it for free
Cause this city can't live without me
Can't live without
Kings of the indie rockers
Top of the toilet choppers
Riots and rebel rousers
High roller phantom powers
But I only live in this city
Live in the city
I only live in this city
Live in the city
I only keep the place busy
Keep on working for free
Cause this city can't live without me
Yeah I only live in this city
Live in the city
I only live in this city
Live in the city
I only keep the place busy
Keep on working for free
Cause this city can't live without me
Can't live without me
Can't live without me
Can't live without me
Yeah I only live in this city
Cause the city can't live without me
