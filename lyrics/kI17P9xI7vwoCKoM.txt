Can you make time for me
I know I broke the glass this time.
I watch your shadow fall
and then I wait for mine.
she's got a tattoo, down her right back, of the planets.
she'll find her way back.
it's such a stupid, simple little thing,
but sometimes these things mean everything.

The sun, the stars, the moon, they all were mine.
