Trust me I feel better
Say it's over baby
Been telling me for a while
That you're gonna stop hurting but I weather
Finally got through the sting
That's the hardest part, seein' in the dark

You're in deep, I see what's going on
It's a twisted cycle you confuse with love
I'm in deep, feel like I'mma die
A fade to mind
I keep letting go but I know you're holding on

Keep me up in bed at night
You're better than you'll ever know
I'm in a story, prisoner...
Taking my time...
You'll never give up now it's over, told ya baby
Pray to the almighty
That you figure out how to pull the trigger
And then you look at me
Someone you know who tried
Now that we're clear, buh-bye

You're in deep, I see what's going on
It's a twisted cycle you confuse with love
I'm in deep, feel like I'mma die
A fade to mind
I keep letting go but I know you're holding on
You're in deep, I see what's going on
It's a twisted cycle you confuse with love
I'm in deep, feel like I'mma die
A fade to mind
I keep letting go but I know you're holding on
