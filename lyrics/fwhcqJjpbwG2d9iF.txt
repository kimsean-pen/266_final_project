So they promised you the stars
The happiness of your distant hopes
But as you tried to catch the moon
Its silver cape slipped through your fingers
Fake was the dawn of their mortality
You are drowning from the flow of your emotions

When all is none

There is a miracle for every soul
An easy way to loose control
The puppeteer and his dolls entertain the frantic crown
Invisible lands your stolen laughs
When all is none

When all is none

Who would be the most competent guardian for you
Than yourself?
Always in range
Under detention even at your sleep
Your life a white chalk on a small blackboard

When all is none
Die
When all is none
