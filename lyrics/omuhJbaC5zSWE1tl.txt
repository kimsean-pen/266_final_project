Fight everyday
For your freedom of mind
Rise and revolt
Before they take it all

Rebel and don't be so exile
They just want you to fit the frame
They're so despicable and vile
And they get no blame
Cuz it's your duty to rise

Get your freedom back
You can have it all
The opressor's there
On the way
You will fight a lot
That's the price you pay
You'll have to stand unwavering
Oh unswerving
Hold tight

Believe in yourself
And burst out with desire
Cross the red lines
People will follow you'll see

They'll involve to evolve
Take your strength
Fears will faint

They'll involve to evolve
Take your strength
Fears will faint

Get your freedom back
You can have it all
The opressor's there
On his way
You will fight a lot
That's the price you pay
You'll have to stand unwavering
Oh unswerving
Hold tight
