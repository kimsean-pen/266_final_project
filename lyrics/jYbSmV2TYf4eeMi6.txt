Here I am once again
Another lesson learned
The bridges that I burned
My lungs fill up with smoke
I'm starting to suffocate
Fighting to stay awake

I'm at the end of the road
I look myself in the mirror
It's over, I regret what I've done
I know it's my fault
Been playing with fire
I can feel it burning my skin

Here I am once again
Another lesson learned
The bridges that I burnt
Such a powerful force
Been playing with fire
I can feel it burning my skin

I'm at the end of the road
I look myself in the mirror
It's over, I regret what I've done
I know it's my fault
Been playing with fire
I can feel it burning my skin

Been playing with fire
I regret what I've done, what I've done
Been playing with fire
Well I know it's my fault, it's my fault

I'm at the end of the road
I look myself in the mirror
It's over, I regret what I've done
I know it's my fault
Been playing with fire
I can feel it burning my skin
