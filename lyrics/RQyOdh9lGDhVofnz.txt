I wanna put myself between both of your legs
And have you kiss my lips to taste what I taste
You can tell the world, baby, that I am just a face
One thing I've learned in this life child
You've gotta give before you take

I'm gonna take you there wherever there is
You'll ride and die with me into the eclipse
We'll sleep like two demon dogs, c'mon, gimme that kiss
If you wanna see where heaven is
You're gonna learn to look deep into the abyss

I don't wanna live forever, baby
I'm not scared to die
Write my name in their blood on the wall like it's 1969

I don't wanna live forever, baby
I'm not scared to die
Start to live like they did in the end back in 1969

Oh I wanna die at 69
Oh I wanna die
Oh I wanna die at 69
Oh I wanna die

I wanna see the run rise in the west
And watch it go down as I watch her undress
She ain't no fool, she knows the worlds in a mess
It don't make no difference to her now 'cause she knows
She can't hold what she don't possess

I like the look of her in the light of my lord
She's wrapped up tighter than a telephone cord
I hold the crown, she holds the sword
Heaven never looks this good as she did in
The gown she wore the last day on the hospital ward

I don't wanna live forever, baby
I'm not scared to die
Write my name in their blood on the wall like it's 1969

I don't wanna live forever, baby
I'm not scared to die
Start to live like they did in the end back in 1969

Oh I wanna die at 69
Oh I wanna die
Oh I wanna die at 69
Oh I wanna die

And at the end of our days I'll hold you in my arms
Until all the syringes run dry and all of our dreams
Lay in the hills with all our enemies dead
There ain't no little piggies left to kill
Through all these hallways of all ways I always will run to you still
