Im right here
When the world explodes
Try to remember these words
Oh, When the world explodes
In the darkest of night
You are my endless fire in sight
Across the waters
Back to shore
Through space and time
You guide me
Afraid there's no more time
Lies in the matter of moment
Face the truth
That i can't unrun
I always known
So if i never get to say this to you
You should still know
Dry your eyes
Find a stream that leads to open water
Washed and divine
Come
Lay with me
Face the truth
That i can't unrun
I always known
So if i never get to say this to you
You should still know
Dry your eyes
Find a stream that leads to open water
Washed and divine
Come
Lay with me
Lay with me!
So if i never get to say this to you
You should still know
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Find a stream that leads to open water
Washed and divine
Come
Lay with me
