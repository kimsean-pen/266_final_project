I've heard it all before
A love is a two way street
You have to give something to this relationship
I'm all out of understanding
It's always something with you
And all I've got to say is

Gave you the best, best years of my life and I
Gave you a woman who stood by your side
Through all your ups and downs
Your rights and all your wrongs
And God knows there were wrongs
I should've been long gone, but when I

Made you that promise for better or worse I said I'd
Stand by your side, I swallowed my pride
And now you're asking me to understand
And I'm telling you I can't
Why should I care about your feelings
When you don't give a damn about mine

Well, I don't want to know
I couldn't care less about your feelings
Don't you know
You should've cared more about mine
And I don't want to know
It really doesn't matter why you're leavin'
You should know
You're really throwin' away your life
And I won't sympathize
You've hurt me for the last time
Got no more tears left to cry

Baby, gave you three hearts
One boy and one girl and a
A woman who loves you
We're sittin' here falling apart
All through your ins and outs
Your fears and all your doubts

God knows there been doubts
But we've given you a home, and you're just
Throwing it away baby
All for some girl born yesterday
And what about your children
There is nothing to explain

But still you're asking us to understand
Well I'm telling you we can't
Why should we care about your reasons
When you're walking right out of our lives

And I don't want to know
I couldn't care less about your feelings
Don't you know
You should've cared more about mine
And I don't want to know
It really doesn't matter why you're leavin'
You should know
You're really throwin' away your life
And I won't sympathize
You've hurt me for the last time
Got no more tears left to cry

Say goodbye to all the love and memories
One last time, one good look at all the love
That won't be in your life
Say goodbye I hope that you'll be happy
Don't look back, 'cuz it'll be too late
I've gone on with my life

And I don't want to know
I couldn't care less about your feelings
Oh, don't you know
You should've cared more about mine
And I don't want to know
It really doesn't matter why you're leavin'
You, you should know
You're really throwin' away your life
And I won't, I won't, I won't sympathize
You've hurt me, hurt me, hurt me for the last time
Got no tears left to cry, no no
