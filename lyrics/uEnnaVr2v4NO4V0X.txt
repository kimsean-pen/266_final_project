The way you're moving across the floor
Don't have to say it
You want some more.
Give me some more, more, more
Give me some more, more, more

I want some more.
Give me what I want
Give me all you've got
Give it to me.

(Whoah, whoah)
Give me what I want
Give me all you've got
Give it to me.
(Whoah, whoah)

Just give it to me.
Tired of playing
I'm getting bored
No need to say it
I want some more

Give me some more, more, more
Cause I'm getting bored, bored, bored.
Give me some more.
Give me what I want

Give me all you've got
Give it to me.
(Whoah, whoah)
Give me what I want

Give me all you've got
Give it to me.
(Whoah, whoah)
Just give it to me.

You've got your daddy's wallet
And your mother's eyes
Soon enough girl, you're gonna realize
When the pretty boys try to get next to you

They really just wanna have sex with you.
Oh, was the way you move

And the clothes you wear
The alcohol
And the way that you don't care
All I wanna do is get next to you, next to you, next you.

That sinful stare
Your poison kiss
Like Satan's daughter's holy lips.
Give me what I want
Give me all you've got

Give it to me.
(Whoah, whoah)
Give me what I want
Give me all you've got
Give it to me.
(Whoah, whoah)
Just give it to me.
(Whoah, whoah)
Oh just give it to me
(Whoah, whoah)
Yeah, darling, give it to me
(Whoah, whoah)
Oh, baby, give it to me
(Whoah, whoah)
Go on and give it to me.
