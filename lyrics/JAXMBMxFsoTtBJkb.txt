So enamoured I'm broken I feel it I am
But I know you hear me, you see me, you can
You gotta learn to love me
Cause I am what I am
You gotta learn to love me
Cause I am what I am
I am
I am
I'm not heavy, I'm nothing you lift me, you can
I feel unsteady, you hear me just give me your hand
You gotta learn to love me
Cause I am what I am
You gotta love me
Cause I am what I am
I am
I am
