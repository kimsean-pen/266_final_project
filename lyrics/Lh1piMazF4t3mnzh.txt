Dark streets, my enemies
In shadows looking to see
I know just where I am going
You stare, there's smoke in your eyes
I get close, my blood is the price
You know just where this is going

Oh, mother, don't you cry
This thing will pass us by
I'm strong, I'll put up a fight
I know it's hard on you
I'm gonna see it through
I swear on everything

I'm not gonna let it burn
I'm not gonna let you see
Fear is what you want
Coming over me

This curse is following me
I will break it, setting us free
I know just where we are going
Old bonds still holding
I'm ending this, I say
I know just where this is going

Oh, mother, don't you cry
This thing will pass us by
We're strong, we'll put up a fight
And I know I'm hard on you
I'm gonna see you through
Let's give it everything

I'm not gonna let it burn
I'm not gonna let you see
Fear is what you want
Coming over me

I'm not gonna let it burn
I'm not gonna let you see
Fear is what you want
Coming over me

Oh, you can run, you can hide, but I swear it
Just swear it
Oh, these walls will tear you down
