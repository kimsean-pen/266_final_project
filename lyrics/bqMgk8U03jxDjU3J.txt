Nice girls don't stay for breakfast
That's what they all say
From New York to Rome

Emily Post would surely say to her host
I've dug the evening the most
But please take me home

Nice girls don't stay for breakfast
And I'm a nice girl
You know that I am

If you're impressed
With these words I professed
I have just one small request

Pass the jam
Please pass the jam
Pass the jam
