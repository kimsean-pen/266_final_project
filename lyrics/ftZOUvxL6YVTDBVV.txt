Well, I've never done nothing
That's ever gonna shame my life
Well, I've never done nothing
That's ever gonna shame my life

Come around any time you like, honey
There ain't no shame in my bed at night

Long legged lover
I'm gonna rip you limb from limb
Long legged lover
I'm gonna tear ya limb from limb

Get you smashed as a rat in some bar
Sink my claws into your velvet skin

Harsh, cruel words, babe
They're gonna cut me like a knife
Harsh, cruel words, babe
They're gonna cut me like a knife

I don't care what the hell you call me
But are ya still coming round tonight?
That's what I wanna know

Well, I've never done nothing
That's ever gonna shame my life, my life, my life, my life
Never, never done nothing
That's ever gonna shame my life, my life, my life, life

Come around any time you like, honey
There ain't no shame in my bed at night
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!
