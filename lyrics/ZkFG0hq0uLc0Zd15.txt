Oh yeah, imagine it's a film and you're the star
And pretty soon we're coming to the part
Where you realise that you should give your heart
Oh, give your heart to me

And now the orchestra begins to make a sound
It goes round and round and round and round
And round and round and round
And round and round again
And we kiss to violins

Well some sad people might believe in that I guess
But we know better, don't we
We know all about the mess
The aftermath of our affair is lying all around
And I can't clear it away
No

And do you think it's so easy to find
Somebody who is just your kind
Oh, it might take you a little time
But I'm going to have to try
Oh, yeah, I'm going to try

And I know no one
Can ever know which way to head
But don't you remember that you once said
That you liked happy endings
Happy endings
And no one can ever know if it's going to work
But if you try
If you try
Then you might get your happy ending

And I know no one
Can ever know which way to head
Don't you remember that you once said
That you liked happy endings
Happy endings
And no one can ever know if it's going to work
But if you try
If you try
Then you might get your happy ending
Your ending and everything that you deserve

Oh and no one
Can ever know which way to head
But don't you remember that you once said you liked happy endings
