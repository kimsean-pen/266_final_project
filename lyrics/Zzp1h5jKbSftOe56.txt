I awake
from blood thick dreams
washing blame
from my knees
softly done
so secretly
I'm awake as charlie sleeps
a lone brother
a lone sister
a home cover
alone
I awake
dry the scream
spit the vile breath
till my tongue bleeds
thinks it's all gone
famously
broke the hard girl
good to please
a lone brother
a lone sister
a home cover
alone
Tell it like it is
tell it like it is
tell the sordid truth
tell them
tell it like it is, tell them.
a lone brother
a lone sister
a home cover, alone
