Just how it is right now
I won't be dying on my knees
Saying oh forgive me please
You'll never be my everything

Steadily, moving away from you, that's all I can do
Selfish, but that's just me
You couldn't wait to see me fail
But talk to me when you see fate and show me someone who is real

Because lately you feel...

Too careless, you never think of me
But when you do I hope you break down
Steadily

Just how it is right now
I won't be dying on my knees
Saying oh forgive me please
You'll never be my everything

Think I'm supposed to care 'bout how you feel
Yeah that's rich
Trying to be clean in the mess, trying to exist in your head
But you're not all there, you're a goddamn wreck

Was I your mistake or your escape?

Too careless, you never think of me
But when you do I hope you break down
Steadily

Just how it is right now
I won't be dying on my knees
Saying oh forgive me please
You'll never be my everything

You're all worn out and I'm walking in
Was bored of you before anything
You're not my anything
You're nothing

Was I your mistake or your escape?

Too careless, you never think of me
But when you do I hope you break down
Steadily
Too scared to close my eyes
Too deaf to hear your cries
No love left in me
I hope it breaks you down
Steadily

As if I had all the answers
