I don't want to be violent, but you make me mad
You are impressive and chrome and I am younger than you thought
Don't ask me where I go cause you already know
I'm smarter than you

I will get a lot from my life because I work hard
Don't ask me what I know cause you already know
Where Jackson and I are gonna go
Where Jackson and I are gonna go
