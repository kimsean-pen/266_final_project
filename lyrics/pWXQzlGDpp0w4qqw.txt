I thought you might have wanted my heart
You taste it, I fall and writhe
In my life I've gone over, you were right
In my life this will never go away

Do what you want to, all will haunt you
All is water, all I wanted.
You have got to, not want to... got to.
All is water, all is life!

Down on my own,
The paralyzing friction was love again
Set on my own,
the wheels are now ready to roll

And I know you're sleeping tonight
And I hope you're dreaming of light
I thought you might have wanted my high
You taste it, I fall and writhe

In my life I've gone over, you were right
In my life this will never go away

Down on my own,
I'm paralyzed, afflicted by love and death
Set on my own,
the muse is not ready to roll

And I know you're sleeping tonight
And I hope you're dreaming of light

Have you found a way?
'Cause you and I remain
And, oh, my god, it's too late to pray

Say the word!

Down on my own,
I'm paralyzed, afflicted by love and death
Set on my own,
the muse is now ready to roll

And I know you're sleeping tonight (I have a fight and I have a right of way)
And I hope you're dreaming of light (I have a fight and I have a right of way)
And I know you're sleeping tonight (I have a fight and I have a right of way)
And I hope you're dreaming of me.

If I knew your words, in through your mind, silently.
