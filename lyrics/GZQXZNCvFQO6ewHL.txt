I never walked on water never saw
A reason to be going out that far (Far)
I never found a star that made a wish
But now the sky is listenin' to my heart (Heart)
They can break me (Break me), make me (Make me)
If they want they can chase me
Love me (Love me), hate me (hate me) I don't care anymore

'Til you, I was nothing but lonely nights
There was nothing but sad goodbyes
For me to fall through
Come true my dreams are awakening
Somebody is making me
The only one in the room
What nobody could do
Nobody 'til you
Nobody 'til you

And the more you talk the less I fear
No matter what you say we are still in the same hemisphere
And there's comfort in just knowing that
Whereever I go a part of me is staying here
With you
So take me (Take me) shake me (Shake me)
If you want you can chase me
Love me (Love me), phone me (Phone me) and stay away from the door

'Til you, I was nothing but lonely nights
There was nothing but sad goodbyes
For me to fall through
Come true my dreams are awakening
Somebody is making me
The only one in the room
What nobody could do
Nobody 'til you

What kind of world would it be
If you ever went away
Oh, and I, I can't go back to what I had
Cause it will never be the same
'Til you, I was nothing but lonely nights
There was nothing but sad goodbye's
For me to fall through

Come true my dreams are awakening
Somebody is making me
The only one in the room
What nobody could do
Nobody 'til you

I was nothing but lonely nights
There was nothing but sad goodbyes
For me to fall through

Come true
I'm awakening
You're shaking me
Nobody knew what to do
Nobody 'til, nobody 'til you
There were lonely nights
'Til you

Well, there were sad goodbyes
Come true
I'm awakening
You're shaking me
Nobody knew what to do
Nobody 'til, nobody 'til
You
