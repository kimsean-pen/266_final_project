So long I've been needin'
Your love hear me pleadin'
Love my heart is bleedin'
Take me back
Where I belong

I know folks are sayin'
From you I've been strayin'
But still I keep prayin'
Take me back
Where I belong

Oooo lonesome me
Why can't you see
Let bygones be
Take me back
Where I belong

Don't be hesitatin'

Too long I've been waitin'
Love, I'm agitatin'
Take me back
Where I belong

Oooo lonesome me
Why can't you see
Let bygones be
Take me back
Where I belong

Don't be hesitatin'
Too long I've been waitin'
Love, I'm agitatin'
Take me back
Where I belong
Take me back now
Where I belong
Take me back
Where I belong
