After all this time
You still couldn't recognise
That your problem lies within
In a vicious circle

Can you tell me why
Why you've thrown it all away
'Cause it makes no sense to me
Why you wouldn't listen

I know it hurts
I tried to help to ease your pain
I know these words
They won't mean anything

I hope it hurts
You've only got yourself to blame
And I can't take this anymore
I'm over it
So over it

Watching you decline
What were you expecting
I can't save you from yourself
When you don't want saving
It's on your head
Don't point the finger point the blame
'Cause the warning signs were clear
You just wouldn't listen

I know it hurts
I tried to help to ease your pain
I know these words
They won't mean anything

I hope it hurts
You've only got yourself to blame
And I can't take this anymore
I'm over it
So over it

Breathe in, breathe out
I feel it coming round again
Breathe in, breathe out
Don't wanna ride your carousel
Breathe in, breathe out
Don't know how much more I can take
Breathe in, breathe out
Just stop 'cause I'm about to break

I know it hurts
I tried to help to ease your pain
I know these words
They won't mean anything

I hope it hurts
You've only got yourself to blame
And I can't take this anymore
I'm over it

I know it hurts
(I know it hurts)
Tried to help to ease your pain
I know these words
(I know these words)
They won't mean anything
I hope it hurts
(I hope it hurts)
You've only got yourself to blame
And I can't take this anymore
Anymore
I'm over it
So over it
I'm over it
So over it
I'm over it
