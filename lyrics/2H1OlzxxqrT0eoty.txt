Sweating blood from open pores in fear of these
nocturnal visits.
Many tongue chatter incessant, deep into my sleeping
self.
Instructing me while I dream from worlds beyond and
below.
Their voices, a kaleidoscope of colours I can't
describe.

Foreign senses stimulate the brain beyond all
comprehension.
An entity only visible as a radiant force.
They speak to me more intensely Knowing now that I am
able
To sculpt the world within this lifting lucid field of
R.E.M.

From under my skin,
The blood I'm sweating
Turns black as it spills from me.
From out of my mind,
Inner voice of reason
Falling away.

My tongue and ears and eyes, removed by the force of
voices
That now control my living river of bleeding endless
black ascendance.
Hear none. Speak none. See a new consciousness beyond
escape.

What am I and what are they to me?
What are they and what am I to them?
Cleansing stream of fluid flowing,
flushing all my fears away.
All the rotting cells I leak
Drown me from the outside in.
Dissolving my expired body
As I'm carried toward the awaiting shore.

Lucid Collective Somnambulation

Voices of many that now become one,
Tell me I must find my other.
For although we've never met in life,
we share the same dream.

(Two minds construct matter from a unified
consciousness,
Reborn to dream forever.)

From her eyes and mouth,
The sands of time spray.
A burial from the inside out.
Expelling endless earth,
Freed from fear.
Becoming dunes that level out
To form the coast of sand and blood.

A mental mending
Existing as dead, alive and dreaming.
Within each blood cell and sand grain,
Shaping the fabric of the collaborative dream-scape.
Triggering the birth of a vast land beyond our earth.

Join us in the vibrant bliss, dream a new reality.
Sleepwalk off the crumbling edge of illusion and
mortality.
See now what the many see, hear now what the many say.
Lock into a lucid state to congregate upon this plane.
This realm grows larger with each new awakened
dreamer.
We will guide you into lucid collective
somnambulation,
Past the portal leaking evil duplicates on earth.

If in dream you truly live, in reality you need not
exist.
Unlock the powers of your sleeping brain
And ascendance from your body will begin.
