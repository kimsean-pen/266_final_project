There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Risin' Sun
And it's been the ruin of many poor girl
And me, oh, God, for one

If I had listened to what my mother said
I'd have been at home today
But I was young and foolish, oh, God
Let a rambler lead me astray

Go, tell my baby sister
"Don't do what I have done
But shun that house in New Orleans
They call the Risin' Sun"

I'm goin' back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
I'm goin' back to spend my life
Beneath that Risin' Sun
