I had nothing to lose
and I had nothing to prove
and I was thinking about me and you

I had nothing to lose
and I had no one to trust
and you were calling my name

I had nothing to lose
and I had nothing to prove
and I was thinking about me and you

I had nothing to lose
and I had no one to trust
and you were calling my name

I just fly under, over
Don't you try
I know I'm going

I just fly
Do what I want
Don't you try

I wanna get away

I had nothing to lose
and I had nothing to prove
and I was thinking about me and you

I had nothing to lose
and I had no one to trust
and you were calling my name

I had nothing to lose
and I had nothing to prove
and I was thinking about me and you

I had nothing to lose
and I had no one to trust
and you were calling my name

I just fly under, over
Don't you try
I know I'm going

I just fly
Do what I want
Don't you try

I wanna get away
