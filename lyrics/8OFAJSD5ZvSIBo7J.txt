And as the low aggress the high
All you can do is sit and cry
You've only got yourself to blame
Don't try to stop me it's too late
My mind's made up, this job won't wait
There's nothing left for me to say

Hey! There's no need to debate
It's time to designate your fate
Take the M out of M A D
Let's all make a bomb

Hey! There's no need to debate
It's time to designate your fate
Take the M out of M A D
Let's all make a bomb

Take one hundred scientists or more
Place in a room and lock the door
Let them confer for half their lives
Unlock the door, go in and see
What they have made for you and me
A brand new toy to idolize

Hey! There's no need to debate
It's time to designate your fate
Take the M out of M A D
Let's all make a bomb

Hey! There's no need to debate
It's time to designate your fate
Take the M out of M A D
Let's all make a bomb

Although the war has just begun
Ignore the sirens, let's have fun
Put on your best, go out in style
Although our future's looking black
We'll go down town and join the pack
Let's celebrate and vaporise

Hey! There's no need to debate
It's time to celebrate your fate
Take the M out of M A D
Let's all make a bomb

Hey! There's no need to debate
It's time to celebrate your fate
Take the M out of M A D
Let's all make a bomb
