Raindrops, fall from, everywhere
I reach out, for you, but you're not there
So I stood, waiting, in the dark
With your picture, in my hands
Story of a broken heart

()
Stay with me
Don't let me go
Cause I can't be without you
Just stay with me
And hold me close
Because I've built my world around you
And I don't wanna know what it's like without you

So stay with me

Just stay with me
I'm trying and hoping, for the day
When my touch is enough
To take the pain away

Cause I've searched for so long
The answer is clear

We'll be ok if we don't let it disappear
()
Stay with me
Don't let me go
Cause I can't be without you
Just stay with me

And hold me close
Because I've built my world around you
And I don't wanna know what its like without you

So stay with me
Just stay with me
I've searched my heart over
So many many times

No you and I
Is like no stars to light the sky at night
Our picture hangs up to remind me of the days
You promised me we'd always be

And never go away
That's why i need you to stay
()
Stay with me
Don't let me go
Cause I can't be without you
Just stay with me
And hold me close
Because I've built my world around you
And I don't wanna know what its like without you
So stay with me
Just stay With me
(Fades)
Oh
Don't leave
So I stand waiting in the dark...
