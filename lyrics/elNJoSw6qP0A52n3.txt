Out across the foothills they rode
Banners as black as their souls
As a winter sky loomed above
Pale as the wind-driven snow
I have seen this day in my dreams
The hour of my doom drawing nigh

Black blades of treachery draw forth my aging blood
And I fall, dying on the cold stones of my throne

Retake the usurper's throne
The blades of our fallen burst forth with the revenant's breath
Destined to fight, even in death
These are the bones that they thought they had shattered
But we'll never rest

Immortal blood courses through my veins
I won't be denied; your battle's lost in vain
I have returned to reclaim my rightful throne
From realms beyond the waking world
We'll rend your flesh from bone

There the young man sits on my throne
Surrounded by ill-gotten gains
Ebon hair and eyes black like coal
Murder and thievery his way
I see the horror gripping his mind
As we descend on his ranks

A thousand men they thought they had killed ride out from the woods
And our steel thirsts for betrayers' flesh and blood

Retake the usurper's throne
The blades of our fallen burst forth with the revenant's breath
Destined to fight, even in death
These are the bones that they thought they had shattered
But we'll never rest

Immortal blood courses through my veins
I won't be denied; your battle's lost in vain
I have returned to reclaim my rightful throne
From realms beyond the waking world
We'll rend your flesh from bone

We traveled realms beyond the crystal moon
And shadowed keeps
Where mighty serpents stalked ensorcelled seas
And ice-crowned peaks
So here we are to bring your end my friend
And none shall week
Betrayal's debt paid in your foul blood
The price is steep

We are revenant
We have returned
So bow your heads
We are your doom

The hoarfrost breaks as steel-shod hooves
Make known their presence to the night
And fires rise against the starwheel, casting smoke into the sky
My bloodline was and always will be rightful heirs to this old throne
Your blood will slake the soil's thirst for sacrifice and blooded stone

Immortal blood courses through my veins
I won't be denied; your battle's lost in vain
I have returned to reclaim my rightful throne
From realms beyond the waking world
We'll rend your flesh from bone
