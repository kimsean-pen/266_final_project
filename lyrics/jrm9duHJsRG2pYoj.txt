Cast your eye
For they've designed
The sharpened fang
A friendly face

Cast your eye
For they've designed
The sharpened fang
A single race

Licking their wounds when they have confrontations
Special kind of vitriol or is it subliminal?
Puffing up their chest because they have big aspirations
Is it sentimental? Is it not just criminal?
I'm not ready to forget this
I'm not read to accept this
I'm not ready

Watch your back
For they'll recruit
The quiet ones
At summer fetes
Watch your back
For they'll recruit
The quiet ones
With silent [?]

What species is this?
What century?
I'm too tired to protest this
But i'm too worried I'll regret this
I'm not ready to accept this

What species is this?
What century?
What species is this?
What species is this?
What species is this?
What century?

Cast your eye
For they've designed
The sharpened fang
A friendly face

Cast your eye
For they've designed
The sharpened fang
A single race

Licking their wounds when they have confrontations
Special kind of vitriol or is it subliminal?
Puffing up their chest because they have big aspirations
Is it sentimental? Is it not just criminal?
I'm not ready to forget this
I'm not read to accept this
