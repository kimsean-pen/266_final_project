It's getting harder to save you from afar
It's getting harder to run
I'll be red Arizona
Deep desert sun
They moved with the stars
My companion

I can't listen to Gene Clark without you anymore

And no one can tell you about love on an island
Picking me flowers, roses and violets
I'm done with lying and then wishing I'm crying
The moonbeams are blinding, shore to shore

I can't listen to Gene Clark without you anymore
I can't listen to Gene Clark without you anymore

Anymore
Without you anymore

I remember the songs you sang
To me when it was you
I was falling for
