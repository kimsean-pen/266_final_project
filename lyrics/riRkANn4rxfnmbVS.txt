My desire to remain
Is all that I have left as I let go
And I don't wanna play this game
But I don't have a choice
I've been ripped from my home
My flesh and bone

So I'll scream your name
With the only breath I have
So I'll scream your name
With the only breath I have left

My reflection in the glass
But I don't recognize what I see
Please don't leave me with my past
My frailties exposed in my last dance
There's one more chance

So I'll scream your name
With the only breath I have
So I'll scream your name
With the only breath I have left

Will my friends be there to greet me around the bend?
Will they know my face, lend their grace as I ascend?
And Dylan said at the end
Wise men know
The dark is right see the birds in flight
But they burn and rage
Burn at the end of the day in rage
Rage, rage against the dying of the light
Do not go gentle into that good night

So I'll scream your name
So I'll scream your name
So I'll scream your name
So I'll scream your name
