Look into your eyes I can't find you
I don't know what happened to the girl I knew
When there was a light that would shine through
Nothing could be wrong when I was here with you

We can bring the days back that we miss
Why should we keep hurting ourselves like this?
How'd we get so lost in same old same old?
Baby I would rather get lost with you

Why don't we escape
You and I could leave this all behind
Now is not too late
I know we could get it right this time

Why can't we escape
You and I could leave this all behind
Now is not too late
There's no way I'm turning back this time

What if all the words were understood?
What if all the doubt was gone for good?
What if I could bring the world to you?
Could you live today like your last few?

What if all the words were understood?
What if all the doubt was gone for good?
What if I could bring the world to you?
Could you live today like your last few?

Why don't we escape
You and I could leave this all behind
Now is not too late
I know we could get it right this time

Why can't we escape
You and I could leave this all behind
Now is not too late
There's no way I'm turning back this time

Don't you see there's nowhere to run?
Don't you see you're faith high?
Can't you see the damage you've done?
Can't you see the fault line?

I know that you're faith high

Can't you see the fault line?
