I've had some bummer days
But I ain't lookin' back
I've made a few mistakes
But I'm on the right track

I got somewhere to be
Gotta hurry so I'll make
My date with destiny
'Cause I don't wanna be late
Here we go

I might take my time
'Cause I find the fable had it right
Slow and steady wins the race
And I might lag behind
But I swear I'll cross the finish line
Movin' at a steady pace

I'll give it all I've got
I don't have a lot
But I know a little goes a long way

The truth is hard to face
But I can take a hit
I've lost in many ways
But a winner don't quit

My head is in the game
And the move is mine to make
But I am not afraid
'Cause I'll fight the good fight

I got somewhere to be
Gotta hurry so I'll make
My date with destiny
'Cause I don't wanna be late
Here we go

I might take my time
'Cause I find the fable had it right
Slow and steady wins the race
And I might lag behind
But I swear I'll cross the finish line
Movin' at a steady pace

I'll give it all I've got
I don't have a lot
But I know a little goes a long

I'll give it all I've got
I don't have a lot
But I know a little goes a long way

I got somewhere to be
Gotta hurry so I'll make
My date with destiny
'Cause I don't wanna be late
