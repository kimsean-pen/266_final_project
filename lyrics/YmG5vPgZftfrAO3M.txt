There's a vessel and it's sinking at sea.
An apparition that's beckoning me.
As the cold dark night brings on the sweat.
I slowly drift away.

Stuck down in the bottom of your cylindrical state of mind.
What are we running from?
There's a distant sound of a melody.
Release me from this place.

A life to live with sedative under the skin.
Bury it, carry the cure.
Just let emotion set devotion within your heart to collect the death we sow.

Step out from the moonlight like it's a game we play.
The checkerboard is tainted drops of red will lead the way.
Black are the lies. Gold are the tongues of the glorified.
Command disease of the body and mind.

Stuck down in the bottom of your cylindrical state of mind.
What are we running from?
There's a distant sound of a melody.
Release me from this place.

A life to live with sedative under the skin.
Bury it, carry the cure.
Just let emotion set devotion within your heart to collect the death we sow.
A life to live a sedative,
A life to live, a sedative under the skin.
Just let emotion set devotion within your heart to collect the death we sow.
Collecting sanity, simply ready, for the life that waits surely.
There's a distant sound of a melody and I won't leave this place.
