Don't look down
They're making sorta crazy sounds, don't look down, no
Don't know who else came to kneel on this empty battlefield
But when I hear that crazy sound I don't look down

From Central Park to Shanty Town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to Shanty Town
There's always something else, don't look down, no

I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name, he never looked down
'Cause they were making crazy sounds

From Central Park to Shanty Town
He always heard that crazy sound
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear
I just hear that crazy sound and I can't look down
I've always heard that crazy sound

From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no, don't look down
Don't look, don't look down

No I won't be bored, I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake
When I hear that crazy sound
I don't look down

From Central park to Shanty Town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to Shanty Town
There's always something else, don't look down, no
Don't look down, don't look, don't look down
