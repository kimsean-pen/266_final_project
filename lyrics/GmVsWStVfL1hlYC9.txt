A constant red on for days and days
I see those lights reflected on your face
Everything can change the the moment that you blink,
But i dont mind

So if you wanna come in then come in
Disintigrate into me tonight
And if you wana give in then give in
Anything that you feel is right

Even if this chemistry's catastrophe
I don't give a fuck (I.D.G.A.F.)
If you wana taste then take a bite right out of me
I don't give a fuck (I.D.G.A.F.)

Freezing time like a strobe on you
Breathing in electronic fumes
We've made our minds and we've made our bed,
So lets sink in

So if you wanna come in then come in
Dissapear into me tonight
And if you wanna give in then give in
Anything that you feel is right

Even if this chemistry's catastrophe
I don't give a fuck (I.D.G.A.F.)
If you wana taste then take a bite right out of me
I don't give a fuck (I.D.G.A.F.)

if you wanna come in, then come in
disappear into me tonight
if you wanna give in, then give in

Ahhhhh! Give into me! Give in to me!

Even if this chemistry's catastrophe
I don't give a fuck (I.D.G.A.F.)
If you wana taste then take a bite right out of me
I don't give a fuck (I.D.G.A.F.)

We're not built to last, shatter like glass, so come on, come on
I don't give a fuck (I.D.G.A.F.)
I cant remember anything, like whats your name?
I don't give a fuck (I.D.G.A.F.)
