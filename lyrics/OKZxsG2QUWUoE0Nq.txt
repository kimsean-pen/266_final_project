A rubber band is what I call your love for me
'Cause it comes and goes and pins me like a trampoline
But all this back and forth is freaky, it's confusing me
Like a pencil trying to write and you're erasing me

If I was a ruler I'll set you straight
But your love is like a sharpener, it really grates
'Cause just when I'm trying to bounce, you pull me back
And when I try to come to you, you give me slack

Your love is pulling like a rubber band
Your love is pulling like a rubber band

Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love
Such a spastic love
Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love
Such a spastic love

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

A rubber was an analogy
You can even say it's a metaphor
The tension between you and me
I ain't gonna feel it if you let it go, go, go, go

I can take a little bit and make it more
A little bit of hate can make it war
But a lot of love ain't enough and so
I don't really know how we find the cure

Your love is pulling like a rubber band
Your love is pulling like a rubber band

Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love
Such a spastic love
Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love
Such a spastic love, love, love

Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together
If we were gaffer tapes maybe we could spend the summer

You could say your piece, you post it on a paper
When your love hits it sticks me like a stapler

Your love is pulling like a rubber band
Your love is pulling like a rubber band

Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love
Such a spastic love
Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love
Such a spastic love

Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love
Such a spastic love
Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love
Such a spastic love

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
