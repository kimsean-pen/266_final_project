Hey, I'm a diamond
I'm spinning clay
I am the wheel
That turns the day
I am waking
To the sound of games
I have never known
In a world of shame
Hey, I am waking
To the sound of games
I have never known
In a world of shame
Hail the way King
Though he's old and grey
The body moves
But the mind's unchained

Hey, I'm a diamond
I'm spinning clay
I am the wheel
That turns the day
Hail the way King
Though he's old and grey
The body moves
But the mind's unchained

I'm a diamond
I'm a diamond
I'm a diamond
I'm a diamond
