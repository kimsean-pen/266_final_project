After a storm
I want to be brave
And keep you warm
And not fade away
As we float from the shore
Into the light
Into the unknown
Like thousands of lanterns
Glowing with grace
In glorious silence
Descending through space
To a friend
A sister in need
Who is not alone
And they are surrounding her
And they will enfold her outstretched hand
In our love

Into the light
It's hard to believe
It's always been ours to give
And to receive
I want to be shameless like the sun

Moving into you

Entering light

Welcome
Inch'Allah, Inch'Allah
Enter one amazing grace is pouring down
Fear not this light
We are of this light divine
So come
We move as one
Amazing grace is pouring down

Fear not this light
We are on this light divine

Welcome
Enter one

After a storm
I wanna let go
Of the things that I've done
Without any worry
I wanna come home

Into the light
Into the unknown
I want to be shameless

Like the sun
Moving into you
Enter light

Welcome
Inch'Allah, Inch'Allah
Enter one
Amazing grace is pouring down
Fear not this light
We are on this light divine
So come
We move as one
Amazing grace is pouring down
Fear not this light
We are on this light divine
Welcome
Enter one
