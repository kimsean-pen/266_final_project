In the corner of dark bar room
Sat an ole' cowboy singin' western tunes
Singin' songs he learned as a child
All about the West back when it was wild
He said he came from down Texas way
The cowboys were tough
The women the same way
Said he was a star back in '31
Hollywood had liked him for some songs that he had done

He's the last of the singin' cowboys
Singin' songs of inspiration and joy
Yippie Yi Yo, Yippie Ay Aye
He took a break, just to chug him down a beer
C'mon folks holler out the songs you'd like to hear
If I know one, I know a million tunes
I'm not up here playin' for me
This is all just for you
And then he bragged on the Stinson hat that he wore
Said it was the finest made since the war
And he won the silver buckle ridin' on a cow
And as he laughed he said
I'll bet you're wonderin' how?

He's the last of the singin' cowboys
Singin' songs of inspiration and joy
Yippie Yi Yo, Yippie Ay A ye

And after three hours or maybe more
A lady grabbed his arm
and showed him to the door
The bartender said, "he's blind, you see
Don't tell him the only audience he had was you and me"

'Cause he's the last of the singin' cowboys
Singin songs of inspiration and joy
Yippie Yi Yo, Yippie Ay A ye
