I'm breathing back and white, let it fool
Caught by your linen eyes, let them fool

But I don't know where we went,
My dear don't don't unfold me and call it all pretend,
Be here and be holy
I don't know where we went
My dear don't unfold me
I'm coloured in again, in you

Green where my red love lies, was it all?
Don't wear your winning prize, let it fool

But I don't know where we went,
My dear don't don't unfold me and call it all pretend,
Be here and be holy
I don't know where we went
My dear don't unfold me
I'm coloured in again, in you

Oh, what a waste, I'll be locked in your heaven, always
Oh, what a way to be living with all of your pain
Oh, what a way to be locking your heaven away
Oh, what a wave you have made
