Lark, you never did get that far
Did ya, did ya?
I thought it wouldn't be this hard for us
Know you're blue
Lover it'll all turn round, you'll see
It always does for you and me
It always does
I can't see the future
Lately luck hasn't been a friend I know
I can't be your sunlight
But I'll hold you when you're cold
I got you
Kiss me with your painted soul
I got you
No matter what the future holds
I got you
It's a fact the past is just the past
But when you do look back
See how far we've came
Oh love, it'll all turn round, you will see
It always does for you and me
It always does
I can't see the future
Lately luck hasn't been a friend I know
I can't be your sunlight
But I'll hold you when you're cold
I got you
Kiss me with your painted soul
I got you
No matter what the future holds
I got you
I got you painted soul
No matter what the future holds
I got you painted soul
No matter what the future holds
I got you
I got you
I got you
Kiss me with your painted soul
I got you
No matter what the future holds
I got you
