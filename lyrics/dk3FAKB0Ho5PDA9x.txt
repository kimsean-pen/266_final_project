Ladies and gentlemen (ladies and gentlemen, ooh-wee)
This is a Jazze Phizzle Productshizzle (Jazze Phizzle)

The princess is here (ooh-wee)
(She's here) Ciara

(This beat is)
Automatic, supersonic, hypnotic, funky fresh
Work my body, so melodic
This beat flows right through my chest
Everybody, Ma and Papi came to party
Grab somebody, work your body, work your body
Let me see you 1, 2 step (here we go)

Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
We about to get it on
Let me see ya
1, 2 Step
I love it when ya
1, 2 Step
Everybody
1, 2 Step
We about to get it on

(This beat is)
Outrageous, so contagious, make you crave it
(Jazze made it)
So retarded, top-charted
Ever since the day I started
Strut my stuff and yes I flaunt it
Goodies make the boys jump on it
No, I can't control myself
Now let me do my 1, 2 step (come on)

Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
We about to get it on
Let me see ya
1, 2 Step
I love it when ya
1, 2 Step
Everybody
1, 2 Step
We about to get it on

(We gon' drop the beat like this, ooh-wee)

It don't matter to me
We can dance slow (ladies and gentlemen)
Which ever way the beat drop
Our bodies will go (I like this)
So swing it over here, Mr. DJ (hey, hey)
And we will, we will rock you (oh yeah)

It don't matter to me
We can dance slow (dance slow ya, ya, ya)
Which ever way the beat drop
Our bodies will go (hey, hey)
So swing over here, Mr. DJ (ladies and gentlemen)
And we will, we will rock you (wee)

I shake it like jello, make the boys say hello
Cause they know I'm rockin' the beat
I know you heard about a lot of great MC's
But they ain't got nothing on me
Because I'm 5 foot 2, I wanna dance with you
And I'm sophisticated fun
I eat fillet mignon
And I'm nice and young
Best believe I'm number one (oh)

Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up (oh)
We about to get it on
Let me see ya
1, 2 Step
I love it when ya
1, 2 Step
Everybody
1, 2 Step
We about to get it on

Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
We about to get it on
Let me see ya
1, 2 Step
I love it when ya
1, 2 Step
Everybody
1, 2 Step
We about to get it on
