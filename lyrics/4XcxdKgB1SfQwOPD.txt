They couldn't see what I thought would be so obvious
They hide behind the laws that they make for all of us
The ministry of truth that deals with pretense
The ministry of peace that sits on defense
I'm washing my hands of what they're tryin' to do
I'm breaking the rules and its for me and for you

I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'll tell you no lies
They say I worship the devil
They must be stupid or blind
I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel

They live their lives of fear and insecurity
And all you do is pay for their prosperity
The ministry of fear that won't let you live
The ministry of grace that doesn't forgive
Do what you will to try and make me conform
But I'll make you wish that you had never been born

Cause I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'll do what I please
I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'm as free as the breeze
I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel

They'll try playin with your heart
The know it rules you head
If they could read between the lines
You know they'd see the real pain

God only knows why they couldn't see the obvious
Is it because that the manifest the incubus
The ministry of war that got caught in the draught
The ministry of joy that still hasn't laughed
When it's all boiled down and the days at an end
I'll give you no bullshit and I'll never pretend

Cause I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'll tell you no lies
They say I worship the Devil
Why don't they open their eyes
I'm just a rock n roll rebel
A rock n roll rebel
