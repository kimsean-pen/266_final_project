Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm the problem
No, I'm not the girl you thought you
Knew and thought you wanted
Underneath that pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side a trouble
But I know that's why you're stayin'

Because you're no angel either, baby
Cause you're no angel either, baby

You're not an angel either
But at least I'm trying
I know i drive you crazy
But would you rather that i be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you're late or when you're lyin'
I love you even more than who I thought you were before

Cause you're no angel either, baby
Cause you're no angel either, baby
Cause you're no angel either, baby
Cause you're no angel either, baby (ohhh)

Ohhh... ohh... ohh...

Tell me do you wanna ride... (ride, ride, ride)
(Ride) Tell me do you wanna ride...

Ride around...
Ride around...
Ride around...
We ride around in that H-town

Those candles in your bed, no need for the spell
Stop actin' so scared, just do what I tell
First both my legs go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah baby I bet

(It comes true) Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm the problem
No I'm not the girl you thought you
Knew and thought you wanted
Underneath that pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side a trouble
But I know that's why you're stayin'

Because you're no angel either, baby
Cause you're no angel either, baby...

You're no angel either baby
