Everybody is made of clay
That's what they used to say
Until the truth stepped on us all
Now everything that was big is small

We're just little crying robots
Program me I wanna win the race, I wanna find the place
Where the king locked up the princess
Jump the fence and drink a little bit of

Red wine, mistakes, apologies
And it's all just red wine, headaches, mythology
Red wine, mistakes, apologies
And it's all just red wine, headaches, mythology

Now who is the king of the sky?
Jupiter says oh me, oh my, oh why?
Is the game always changing
I've been through some strangeness

What's the matter
Is the feast not fat enough?
Up the ladder with your feet
Reaching with your hands

You can feel it and dream it
I know you want to believe it
Just steal it
Take a piece of the sun and drink some

Red wine, mistakes, apologies
And it's all just red wine, headaches, mythology
Red wine, mistakes, apologies
And it's all just red wine, headaches, mythology

Now everybody's in the play
At least that's what the script told me to say
I'd say, shadows cut across the hero's face
He falls from grace until a little bird sang

The truth is never ending
We're just here pretending
Let's all laugh so that we don't cry
Let's all lift our glasses up to the sky for some

Red wine, mistakes, apologies
And it's all just red wine, headaches, mythology
Red wine, mistakes, apologies
And it's all just red wine, headaches, mythology
