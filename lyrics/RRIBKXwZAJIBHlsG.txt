Black is the color for the dead inside me.
Red is the one for our love.
No one will hurt you!, he said and left me, No one will hurt you I promise!.
Counting the days, the nights till it's over.
Counting the lights and the stars.
All I want is to sacrifice my body, my heart and my soul.
Me, the dead, you left behind you.
