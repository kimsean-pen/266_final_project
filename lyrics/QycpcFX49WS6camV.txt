What I do I say
But I can't get far away
Oh, I go back to
A memory again
What you want
But you know that I'm alive
Then I'll go back to you
Don't you know (what I) feel inside

When you (come down) blue
But I do, I do, I do
Oh, I come back to
The one who calls my name out
What you want
Don't you know that I can smile
Then I go back to you
And then you make (him go inside)
Turn around and smile
(No) they can't see through your eye
Could I fall into
talk
Come back down
my mind
Then (it) surrounds you
Don't you know that I have st

When you (come down) blue
But I do, I do, I do
Oh, I come back to
The one who calls my name out
What you want
Let me know that I'm alive
Then I go back to you
And then you make (him go inside)
