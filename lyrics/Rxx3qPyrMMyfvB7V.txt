A bar room may entice
A seagull like me
Right off the sea
Right off the sea
And into the bar room
The bar room
The bar room
Bar room, bar room

And let go, yeah let go of the trapeze
And melt the snow of dream river
(Dream river) River
(Dream river) River
(Dream river) River

I wonder if I'll ever wake up
I mean really wake up
Wake up and wake you too
First thing that I will do
I will wake you too

How long have I been gone?
How long have I been traveling?
And how tired have I been?
And how far have I got?
In circling
and circling
and circling

With all the tolls we pay
We'll own the highway someday
With all the tolls we pay
We'll own the highway someday

And the weight of the world slips away
Slips away

And the seagull falls back on the sea
