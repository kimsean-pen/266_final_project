Lost and alone, neon land of no return
Nowhere to hide, as the city lights burn
Faster than fire, you'd better get a gun
Cause this city is deadly, little girl you better run
So if you need me won't you call me tonight?
If you're in trouble and you need me tonight, just call

Used up and broken, did you enjoy the ride?
Haven't heard from you lately, are you dying inside?
Was it all that you wanted? Was it more than your share?
Haven't heard from you lately, does it mean you don't care?

But when the lights go out and the city wakes
And you're left with only your mistakes
When all hope is lost, i can take the heat
I'm your vigilante on the streets

So if you need me won't you call me tonight?
If you're in trouble and you need me tonight, just call
