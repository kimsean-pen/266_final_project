You're stuck on me and my laughing eyes
I can't pretend though I try to hide
I like you
I like you

I think I felt my heart skip a beat
I'm standing here and I can hardly breathe
You got me, yeah
You got me

The way you take my hand is just so sweet (ah)
And that crooked smile of yours
It knocks me off my feet

Oh, I just can't get enough
How much do I need to fill me up?
It feels so good it must be love
It's everything that I've been dreaming of

I give up, I give in, I let go, let's begin
Cause no matter what I do
Oh (oh) my heart is filled with you

I can't imagine what it'd be like
Living each day in this life without you
Oh, without you (mm)

One look from you I know you understand (ah)
This mess we're in you know is just so
Out of hand
Oh, I just can't get enough

How much do I need to fill me up?
It feels so good it must be love
It's everything that I've been dreamin' of
I give up, I give in, I let go, let's begin

Cause no matter what I do
Oh (oh)
My heart is filled with you
I hope always feel this way (I know we will)

And in my heart I know that you'll always stay
Oh, I just can't get enough
How much do I need to fill me up?
It feels so good it must be love

I give up, I give in, I let go, let's begin
Cause no matter what I do
(Oh) Oh, I just can't get enough
How much do I need to fill me up?

It feels so good it must be love
(It's everything that I've been dreamin' of)
I give up, I give in, I let go, let's begin
Cause no matter what I do, oh (oh)

My heart is filled with you, oh (oh)
You got me, you got me
Oh (oh), oh (oh)
You got me, you got me
