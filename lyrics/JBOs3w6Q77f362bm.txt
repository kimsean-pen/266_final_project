You're a curse
I cut my lips on your diamond hands
I'm at my worst
When you're breaking my heart's remand

There's nothing to say that you don't know
You're walking away when I won't go
This isn't the first time you won't stay
This isn't the last time you will hear me say

Bleed me from the heart
Need me for my heart

I saw you first
You caught my eye in a sideways glance
You're making it worse
When you tell me I had my chance

So what can I say to make it clear?
You're running away when I'm still here
This isn't the first time you won't stay
This isn't the last time you will hear me say

Bleed me from the heart
Need me for my heart

Say the words
Just like the song that you once wrote
It's like a curse
And I'm winding it round my throat

I'd shown you the way but you won't drive
You tear us apart but this won't die
This isn't the first time you won't play
This isn't the last time you will hear me say

Bleed me from the heart
Need me for my heart
