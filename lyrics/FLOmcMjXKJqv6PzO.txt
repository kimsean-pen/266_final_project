I'm drawn to the blood
The flight of a one-winged dove
How? How did this happen?
How? How did this happen?

The strength of his arm
The father of my last child
How? Head of a rabbit
How? Head of a rabbit

For my prayer has always been love
What did I do to deserve this?

With blood on my sleeve
Delilah, avenge my grief
How? God of Elijah
How? God of Elijah

As fire to the sun
Tell me what I have done
How? Heart of a dragon
How? Heart of a dragon

For my prayer has always been love
(What did I do) To deserve this?
(What did I do, what did I do)
To deserve this? To deserve this?
(What did I do) To deserve this?
(What did I do) To deserve this?
(What did I do)
