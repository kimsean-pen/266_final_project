Beyond the mountains
where the wind cries out its pain
Deserted valleys
where the darkness always reigned

Where the sunlight never ever
touched the poisoned ground
Where the laugh of undead children
never ever sound

Forever wrapped in darkness
the forgotten valleys of Hades

Forgotten damned domains
where curse and hate collide
Where the cold and darkness meet
and the truth have turned to lie

Where the flame of love growls cold
and its powers never rise
And hand of death has grasped
every form of light

Forever wrapped in darkness
the forgotten valleys of Hades
