Well, I have been hunting on the one ten with Jesus for a liar
And watched an ancient man use a gun to retire
I seen the wall fall down and crush the old
So now everybody's hungry but they'd rather be cold

Let it go, let it go, let it go
Before we lose it all in time
What's deserved always get served

'Cause we stick therefore we can
'Cause we stick therefore we can
'Cause we stick therefore we can
Break down end time, hey fool haven't you heard Heaven's not overflowing

And I been to a seance for the Klu Klux Klan
I've seen a brother kill another with his own bare hand
I seen your rising son fall in your mama's eye
And now the cops got a medal but he calls it a prize

Let it go, let it go, let it go
Before we lose it all in the time
What's deserved always get served

'Cause we stick therefore we can
'Cause we stick therefore we can
'Cause we stick therefore we can
Break down end time, hey fool haven't you heard Heaven's not overflowing
Heaven's not overflowing

You know the rules only apply on the witness stand
At that you never get in trouble if you stick with your plan
That's why I'm livin for the day like a necromancer
'Cause when you go your gone, take the pain back stabber, oh stick me

Let it go, let it go, let it go
Before we lose it all in the time
What's deserved always get served
