I just have this feeling
I have this feeling it's gonna be alright
And I just can't believe it
That you're here with me tonight

One look in your eyes and it was over
Caught me by surprise, I got ran over
One look in your eyes and it was over
It was over
It was over

I don't need anything, anything better
All I need is your love to make me happy
I don't need anything, anything better
All I need is your love to make me happy
You make me happy
You make me happy
All I need is your love to make me happy
You make me happy
You make me happy
All I need is your love to make me happy

I know that you see me
And now you see me in the bed light
And I just can't believe it
That you're here with me tonight

One look in your eyes and it was over
Caught me by surprise, I got ran over
One look in your eyes and it was over
It was over
It was over

I don't need anything, anything better
All I need is your love to make me happy
I don't need anything, anything better
All I need is your love to make me happy
You make me happy
You make me happy
All I need is your love to make me happy
You make me happy
You make me happy
All I need is your love to make me happy

(Uh-uh...)

I don't need anything, anything better
All I need is your love to make me happy
I don't need anything, anything better
All I need is your love to make me happy
You make me happy
You make me happy
All I need is your love to make me happy
You make me happy
You make me happy
All I need is your love to make me happy

I just have this feeling
I have this feeling it's gonna be alright
