got myself a little dog
his color was a brown
sailed him 'round the ocean
the world around
and when I take my little doggie places
he stays with me all the time
he's going places
na-na-na-na-nana-nana
my little dog
got myself a little dog
his color was a brown
sailed him 'round the ocean
the world around
when I take my little dog with me away
it gone stay by my side all day
na-na-na-na-nana-nana
my little dog
got myself a little dog
his color was a brown
sailed him 'round the ocean parts
the world around
and an when I take my little dog away
all he wants to do is run and jump and play
na-na-na-na-nana-nana
my little dog
