I thought we had a good thing going,
I never thought you'd be so cunning
Lightening in a dark room, honey,
Fine until it hits your body

I'm stuck in the living room,
Pace through my thoughts of you
There's fire in the way you choose
To let your heavy heart stay bruised
As I carry it home with me,
And the weight of everything

Push on my cold lungs and break me swiftly,
Just take what you want, but I won't make it easy

Take what you want from me,
I'm sure I made it easy, not being what you needed
Say what you want, you always do
Nothing new

You couldn't leave your words uncovered,
I never thought you'd leave so sudden
Underneath the roof we're flooding,
Currents wrap around our bodies
And it kept me deceptive
To a bed dipped in poison

Just take what you want, but I won't make it easy

Take what you want from me,
I'm sure I made it easy, not being what you needed
Say what you want, you always do
Nothing new
I'm sick of waiting,
Just contemplating our past mistakes
And misguided chase scenes
My mind is made up, enough is enough
Take what you want from me,
I'm sure I made it easy, not being what you needed
Say what you want, you always do
Take what you want from me,
I'm sure I made it easy, not being what you needed
Nothing new
Take what you want from me,
I'm sure I made it easy, not being what you needed
Say what you want, you always do
I'm sure I made it easy
Nothing new
