Text me when you need my things
Call me when you need the shoes I'm in
Never ask how I got here
Then what do you care
Breathe all my air, I'm suffocating

Seventeen months, no sin
Never thought we'd make it 'till the end
So why ask how I'm doing
Act so confusing
Don't be polite it's overrated

Cut it out, cut it out
Take off your halo
No blame, no
Can we just be favor friends?
Wrap it up, wrap it up in cellophane, oh
No shame no
Can we just be favor friends?

Browsing through my contacts then
No need to be playing sad violins, honey
I wish you only love, fame and money
Dance in my mind periphery
You're busy busy bee
Don't say you miss me
You busy busy bee
Take all you can and leave
You busy busy bee
Don't say you miss me
Dance in my mind periphery

Cut it out, cut it out
Take off your halo
No blame, no
Can we just be favor friends?
Wrap it up, wrap it up in cellophane, oh
No shame no
Can we just be favor friends?
Cut it out, cut it out
Take off your
Cut it out, cut it out
Take off your
Cut it out, cut it out
Take off your
Can we just be favor friends?

Eeny meeny many minute
Need another need another
Favor favor, wanna do a favor?
Eeny meeny many minute
Imma need'a, imma need'a
Favor favor, wanna do a favor?

(opera singing)

Cut it out, cut it out
Take off your halo
No blame, no
Can we just be favor friends?
Wrap it up, wrap it up in cellophane, oh
No shame no
Can we just be favor friends?
Cut it out, cut it out
Take off your (halo)
Cut it out, cut it out
Take off your (halo)
Cut it out, cut it out
Take off your (halo)
Can we just be favor friends?

Cut it out, cut it out
Take off your (halo)
Cut it out, cut it out
