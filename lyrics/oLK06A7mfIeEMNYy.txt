I got some champagne
You got some some wine
We're gonna have us a sensual time

I got some candles
You got a rose
Let's annoy all those that turn up their nose

They just can't handle seductive expression
They may think its gross when we teach them the lesson
I wont cross the line, let your body be free
Let's harass the world sensually
