Come hear the voices in my head
They say you wanna hurt me
and they want you dead
Its scraping the bottom of the barrel of life
Theres a million different voices
And they're synchronized
Into one real army that will kill you all
Injecting my brain with adrenaline
They're marching
They're screaming
They wanna get out
They're armed to the teeth
It's the Blut Royale

(Come to me)
Come hear the voices in my head
(Come to me)
They say you wanna hurt me
and they want you dead
(Come to me)
Come hear the voices in my head
(Come to me)
They want you dead

It's the Blut Royale
(It's the Blut Royale)
(It's the Blut Royale)
(It's the Blut Royale)

Come hear the voices in my head (head, head, head.)
Come hear the voices in my head (head, head, head.)

Come hear the voices in my head
They say you wanna hurt me
and they want you dead
Come hear the voices in my head
They want you dead

It's the Blut Royale
(It's the Blut Royale)
