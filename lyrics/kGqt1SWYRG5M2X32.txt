I've settled down
A twisted up frown
Disguised as a smile
Well, you would have never known
I had it all, but not what I wanted
Cause hope for me was a place uncharted
And overgrown

You'd make your way in
I'd resist you just like this
You can't tell me to feel
The truth never set me free
So I did it myself

You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out a little more
More

Open your eyes like I open mine
It's only the real world
Life you will never know
Shifting your way to throw off the pain
Well you can ignore it

But only for so long
You look like I did
You resist me just like this
You can't tell me to heal
And it hurts remembering

How it felt to shut down
You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out a little more
More

The truth never set me free
The truth never set me free

The truth never set me free
So I'll do it myself
You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out
You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out
