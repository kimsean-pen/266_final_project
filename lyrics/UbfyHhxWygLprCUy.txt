we were always meant to be
and even if you disagree
you could never get away
with your arm chained to the gate

sometimes i can't control the things i do
but you know i only want the best for you
is it too much to ask for you to say?
i will not defy you

and if things should go awry
i'll forgive you love, in time
there's no secret you can't keep
there's no cut that is too deep

sometimes i can't control the things i do
but you know i only want the best for you
and if i should find that you could ever stray
i would crucify you

oh, and i will run you through
to show i care, to long for you
promises i'll hold you to
and you to me, an eye to you

oh, and i will run you through
to show i care, to long for you
promises i'll hold you to
and you to me, i'm watching you

sometimes i can't control the things i do
but you know i only want the best for you
somehow you never seem to go my way, hey hey
so i must crucify you
