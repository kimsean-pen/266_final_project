Every time I see you smile
Come to me, don't be long
Let me tell you how my heart goes wild
Please, let me love you and it won't be wrong

Every time I'm in your arms
Come to me, don't be long
You know that I'll never do you harm
Please, let me love you and it won't be wrong

Let me love you, then you'll see
Come to me, come to me
Let me show you once and we'll be free
Please, let me love you and it won't be wrong

Every time I see you smile
Come to me, don't be long
Let me tell you how my heart goes wild
Please, let me love you and it won't be wrong

Let me love you, then you'll see
Come to me, come to me
Let me show you once and we'll be free
Please, let me love you and it won't be wrong
Please, let me love you and it won't be wrong
Please, let me love you and it won't be wrong
