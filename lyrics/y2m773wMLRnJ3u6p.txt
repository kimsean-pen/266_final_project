Now greetings to the world (all of you)
Voice a de called Bruno Mars long side Gong the Zilla (you know me and roll)

Standing at this liquor store
Whisky coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block (oh really)
Lotto tickets and cheap beer
That's why you can catch me here
Tryna scratch my way up to the top
Because my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose (no feel up)
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues (yo)

I'll take one shot for my pain (oom) One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today (I roll) I'll be ok tomorrow.
One shot for my pain, (who) one drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today (you know me) I'll be ok tomorrow

Me and my guitar tonight, singing to the city lights
Tryna live on more than what I got (really)
'Cause '68 Citrus ain't gonna pay the rent
So I'll be out here til they call the cops
Because my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose (oh no no...)
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

I'll take one shot for my pain (oom) One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today, I'll be ok tomorrow
One shot for my pain, one drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today, I'll be ok tomorrow

Here comes junior gong
I'm flying like I'm Superman
I'm thinking that I run the whole block
I don't know who fi just because
Pineapple kush between my jaws
Has got me feeling like I'm on top
Feeling like I woulda stand up to the cops
And stand up to de big guys
Because whole a dem a shops
All they talk dem a dem and then fly make no drop
Nuff ghetto youth cannot escape the trap

Give me this one shot for my pain (boom)
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today, I'll be ok tomorrow (yeah)
One shot for my pain, one drag for my sorrow (I roll)
Get messed up today, I'll be ok tomorrow
