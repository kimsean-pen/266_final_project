I need you love
In every way
I need your strength
To make me great
I've been so wrong
Am I too late?

Just hold me like Johnny Cash

When I lost my mother

Whisper in my ear

Just like June Carter

And though
I fight
These tears that I hide
Just hold
Me tight
For the rest of my life

I need your mind
To understand
I need your soul, it makes me a better man
With you by my side
I'd have a chance

Just hold me like Johnny Cash

When I lost my mother

Whisper in my ear

Just like June Carter

And though
I fight
These tears that I hide

Just hold
Me tight
For the rest of my life

Mm
Yeah
With you by my side
I'd have a chance

Just hold me like Johnny Cash

When I lost my mother

Whisper in my ear
Just like June Carter

And though
I fight
These tears that I hide
Just hold
Me tight
For the rest of my life
