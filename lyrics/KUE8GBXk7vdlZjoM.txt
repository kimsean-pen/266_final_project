Here I am again
Trading in a group of friends
To hopefully make amends
With everything I've done wrong
A last ditch effort
To find something better
And leave well enough alone

I will wait through all the words of happiness
I will wait through all the words of jubilation
I will hope for just an ounce of confidence
To offer myself some sort of congratulations

...
There is a light I'm trying to find
Between the water and the open sky
I know that's where the wild winds blow
Through times of trouble
Or just a simple stumble

I can go and make some real good noise
Still I wait through all the words of happiness
Still I wait through all the words of jubilation
I will hope for just an ounce of confidence

To offer myself some sort of congratulations
I wanna live where the wild winds blow
I know
I wanna live where the wild winds blow
I know
