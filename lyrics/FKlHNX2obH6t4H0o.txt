What a feeling when I feel a feel for real
I'm overwoke and flippin' a table

I shed a tear and then appear in the mirror
Still hear but blasted out through pineal cable

Sand trap, the only path is still under construction
Same vein but different textures
An infinite selection

I'm finna whip my hip out my frame
Twist bone that hooks through the brain
Loops lonely needs a twin action
Fast enough to flip the attraction

I hide away
Pacing back and forth
Some vanity is what I need
But I'm stuck slouching

I lie awake
When all my dreams fall short
Of everything that I could be
If I stopped slouching

Come back to my range
If you can't hang you know I won't change

She'd be a model if you gave her some time
She'll spin the bottle if you give her a sign

I can see it and it's audibly wobbly
Tastes just like a can of broccoli
Fishing hook like slimy apostrophe
One letter missing between two monstrosities

I'm finna whip my hip out my frame
Twist bone that hooks through the brain
Loops lonely needs a twin action
Fast enough to flip the attraction

I hide away
Pacing back and forth
Some vanity is what I need
But I'm stuck slouching

I lie awake
When all my dreams fall short
Of everything that I could be
If I stopped slouching

Oh... Blast!

Cut after cut of liquid energy
Beams are buffed and I'm like "yay"
Back in the beast, hate this impulse slave
Close it up then ride the wave

I just wanted to be the slick glaive robed in glow
Snake round the wheel, now I know what I known
I just wanted to be the slick glaive robed in glow
All wrapped up and raving and rolled through the snow, go

Go
Go
Go
Go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
