Straight in, suck up and go,
cool it, swallow, swallow
Breathe deep, take it all
it comes cheap
Push it through the doors
because in between the lines
I'm gonna pack more lines
so I can get in

Ooh traffic jam got more cars
than a beach got sand
Suck it up, suck it up, suck it up,
fill it up until no more
I'm no crazy creep, I've got it coming
to me because I'm not satisfied
The hunger keeps on growing

I eat too much
I drink too much
I want too much
Too much
I've got to get it somewhere
I mean, you never know, maybe you're dreaming
Who do you think you're watching
Who do you think you need
Play for me, play more,

Ten times in the same day
I need more, I'm going
over my borders
I'm going to take more, more
from you, letter by letter
I eat too much
I drink too much
I want too much
Too much
I told, god, I'm coming
to your country
I'm going to eat up your cities,
your homes, you know
I've got a stomach full it's not
a chip on my shoulder
I've got this growl in my tummy
and I'm gonna stop it today
I eat too much
I drink too much
I want too much
Too much
Suck it up...
