If I had a gun
I'd shoot a hole into the sun
And love would burn this city down for you

If I had the time
I'd stop the world and make you mine
And everyday would stay the same with you

Give you back a dream
Show you now what might have been
For the tears you cry would fade away

I'll be by your side
When they come and say goodbye
We will live to fight another day

Excuse me if I spoke too soon
My eyes have always
Followed you around the room
'Cause you're the only
God that I will ever need
I'm holding on and waiting for the moment to find me

Hope I didn't speak too soon
My eyes have always
Followed you around the room
'Cause you're the only
God that I will ever need
I'm holding on and waiting for the moment
For my heart to be unbroken by the sea

Let me fly you to the moon
My eyes have always followed you around the room
'Cause you're the only
God that I will ever need
I'm holding on and waiting for the moment to find me

If I had a gun
I'd shoot a hole into the sun
And love would burn this city down for you
