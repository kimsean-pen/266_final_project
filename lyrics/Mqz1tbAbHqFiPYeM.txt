I love you in this light
Your head's in the sand and you're crying inside tonight
You have to let it go
There's nothing in the world that will stop me from taking you whole

Your body is the answer
Your mind is in chains
Your body is the answer
Your body is the answer
Your mind is in chains
Your body is the answer
Your body is
Your body
Your body
Your body

The union, the divine
When I touch you and I taste you I only want to be inside
Reaction and release
There's something that's stirring deep in me
There's something that's stirring deep in me

Your body is the answer
Your mind is in chains
Your body is the answer
Your body is the answer
Your mind is in chains
Your body is the answer
Your body
Your body
Your body
Your body
Your body
