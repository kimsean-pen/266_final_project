Rose hip November
Autumn I'll remember
Gold landing at our door, catch one leaf and fortune will surround you evermore

Pine tree very tall, waiting for snow to fall
Mist hangs very still, caught by dawn in castle moats around the sleeping hill

Now a pipe is heard happy is the shepherd
Shepherdess and dog, father of the pastureland and mother of the flock

Rosehip November
Autumn I'll remember
Gold landing at our door, catch one leaf and fortune will surround you evermore
Evermore
Evermore
