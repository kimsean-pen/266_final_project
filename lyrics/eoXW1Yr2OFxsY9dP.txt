I was down for the count
Feeling like I've come to the end
Nothing really mattered
Nothing left for me to mend
(Ohhhhh...)
And then you came and I still could'nt see
Till you tore down every wall in me
How you heal me with your patience
If it's all I ever do
I'll never stop loving you
Cause I'm alive
I can breath
I can feel
I believe
And there ain't no doubt about it
There ain't no doubt about it
I'm in love
And it's all because of you
I was fading but you pulled me through
Cause I'm away
I survive
I was hurt
Thought I died
And there ain't no doubt about it
It's love and I have found it
Feel the beat again
Stronger than before
I'm gonna give you my heart
Until it beats no more
Was in a place full of pain
With a broken down heart
In despair
He took away my feeling
And made it hard for me to care
(Ohhhhh...)
But then you crushed through the door to my soul
Put back all the pieces and made me whole
I was living in the past
(Oh no)
Now I'm never looking back
I'm never looking back
Cause I'm alive
I can breath
I can feel
I believe
And there ain't no doubt about it
There ain't no doubt about it
I'm in love
And it's all because of you
I was fading but you pulled me through
Cause I'm away
I survive
I was hurt
Thought I died
And there ain't no doubt about it
It's love and I have found it
Feel the beat again
Stronger than before
I'm gonna give you my heart
Until it beats no more
Whatever you want me to
I'm gonna see it through
All that I ever do
Never stop loving you
Cause I'm alive
I can breath
I can feel
I believe
(Hey yeah)
And there ain't no doubt about it
There ain't no doubt about it
I'm in love
And it's all because of you
I was fading but you pulled me through
(Fading but you pulled me through)
Cause I'm away
I survive
I was hurt
Thought I died
(Hey yeah)
And there ain't no doubt about it
(There's just no doubt)
(I'm much stronger)
Feel the beat again
So much stronger than before
I'm gonna give u my heart
Until it beats no more
