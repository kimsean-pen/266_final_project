Creature from another life
Walking out from in the light
The times is wrong, place is right
And he crosses to the other side

He reached out and touched her hand
Yeah, and awoke in wonderland
Where black is white and wrong is right
But she killed him with her half smile

It made his life worth living

And now she's gliding away
And he hesitates
Yeah, he waits and he waits
Now she's changing her name
Petals in the air float to the ground
Oh this life is fleeting, fleeting, fleeting
Oh oh chasing a feeling, feeling, oh feeling

So he threw away his safety net
And climbed into his fighter jet
Launching missiles as goodbyes
He planned his kamikaze dive

But she made his life worth living

And now she's gliding away
And he hesitates
Yeah, he waits and he waits
Now she's changing her name
Petals in the air float to the ground

And now she's gliding away
And he hesitates
Yeah, he waits and he waits
Now she's changing her name
Petals in the air float to the ground
Oh this life is fleeting, fleeting, fleeting
Oh oh chasing a feeling, feeling, feeling

Oh this life is fleeting, fleeting, fleeting
Oh oh chasing a feeling, feeling, oh feeling
