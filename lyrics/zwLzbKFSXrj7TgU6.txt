I was one of those who lived in doubt.
I was one of those
Who could not accept how far.
Counting on the ones we chose will find.
There's no innocence,
since we think therefore we are.
I will fight the system.
Break it down and redesign it.
I don't want anything
the way it's created by them.
Where is my right to choose,
if all the options are theirs.
There were some of those who told the truth.
Who before they rose,
all were children just like you.
Sons and daughters standing with our earth
shedding light on those
that would bleed us, out of view
They show you.
I will fight the system.
Break it down and redesign it.
I don't want anything
the way it's created by them.
Where is my right to choose,
if all the options are theirs.
We can be the system,
it will turn and try own us.
We can have everything,
if we will change in to them.
Now it's our time to choose,
which of the options are theirs.
Slow it down we're treading on the soil that gave us life.
Slowing down we're comign round, I'm fearing for our lives.
Ways we leave all that matter, all that we have.
Placed be your trust with me.
