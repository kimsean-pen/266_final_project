And it fills me up
And the stars don't shine
And I said, burn when you bring me sunlight
Is it all you need
To feel this heat
To feel like everything's all that you dreamed
Is it all too much
And did you get enough
Does it set on fire all the things that you touch
And it fills me up
And the stars don't shine
And I said, burn when you bring me sunlight

Up, up, up up, up up
Up, up, up up, up up
Up, up, up up, up up
Up, up, up up, up up
And it fills me up
And the stars don't shine
And I said, burn when you bring me sunlight
And its all you need
To feel this heat
To feel like everything's all that you dreamed
And is it all too much
Did you get enough
Does it set on fire all the things that you touch
And it fills me up
And the stars don't shine
And I said, burn when you bring me sunlight
And it fills me up
And the stars don't shine
And I said, burn when you bring me sunlight
And its all you need

To feel this heat

To feel like everything's all that you dreamed
And is it all too much
Did you get enough
Does it set on fire all the things that you touch
And it fills me up
And the stars don't shine
And I said, burn when you bring me sunlight
Up, up, up up, up up
Up, up, up up, up up
Up, up, up up, up up
Up, up, up up, up up
Up, up, up up, up up
Up, up, up up, up up
Up, up, up up, up up
Up, up, up up, up up
