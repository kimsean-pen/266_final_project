A stolen kiss, a moment to run free.
The veil drops in an instant to reveal
A flashback, a postcard from a distant dream.

Moon palace
On a frozen sea.

The serpent sea is calling out your name
The serpent sea is calling you again
Serpent sea has landed and is crashing at your feet.
As city canyons fade into the night
A jagged landscape in a sodium haze
Breaks away from the sky
To shelter sparkling eyes
A stolen kiss sends electricity
It trips a switch for a moment to reveal
A vision, a picture of a shared dream.

Moon palace
On a frozen sea.

The serpent sea is calling out your name
The serpent sea is calling you again
The serpent sea is calling out your name
The serpent sea has landed and is crashing at your feet
The serpent sea is calling out your name
The serpent sea is calling you again
The serpent sea is calling out your name
The serpent sea is calling out your name
The serpent sea is calling you again
The serpent sea has landed and is crashing at your feet.

Moon palace
On a frozen sea.
