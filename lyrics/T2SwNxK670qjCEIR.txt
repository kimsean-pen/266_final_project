Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My laser's trace
Everything you do

You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time

I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

I'm elected, electric spy
I'm protective, electric eye

Always in focus
You can't feel my stare
I zoom into you
But you don't know I'm there

I take a pride in probing
All your secret moves
My tearless retina
Takes pictures that can prove

I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

I'm elected, electric spy
I'm protective, electric eye.

Electric eye
In the sky
They feel the stare
So always there

There's nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows

I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

I'm elected, electric spy
I'm protective, electric eye
I'm elected, electric spy
I'm elected
Protective, detective
Electric eye
