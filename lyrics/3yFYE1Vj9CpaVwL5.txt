Oh dear, oh dear, I'm sorry
That you grew up so soon
A cold year and no high school parties
I've been drinking alone
Oh, I've been drinking alone, so

Don't fear, don't fear the warnings
They're bitterer than most
Four years, they're driving across the country
For empty seats at their shows
And they've been drinking alone, so

Keep your time, keep your mind, keep humble
Start your life in the middle of the jungle
You
Young Blood

Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry
Stay alive, try to lose all of your money
You
Young Blood
You
Young Blood
Young Blood

So when you're mad for no reason
At everything at once
And when you start overthinking
I'll be drinking at home
Oh, I'll be drinking at home, so

Keep your time, keep your mind, keep humble
Start your life in the middle of the jungle
You
Young Blood

Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry
Stay alive, try to lose all of your money
You
Young Blood
You
Young Blood
Young Blood

And if you want, I can tell the truth
That this life takes a toll on you
I spend nights stitching up the loose threads of my soul
In the morning I'm bulletproof

And if you want, I can tell the truth
That this life takes a toll on you
I spend nights stitching up the loose threads of my soul
In the morning I'm bulletproof
In the morning I'm bulletproof, so

Keep your time, keep your mind, keep humble
Start your life in the middle of the jungle
You
Young Blood

Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry
Stay alive, try to lose all of your money
You
Young Blood
You
Young Blood
You
Young Blood
Young Blood
