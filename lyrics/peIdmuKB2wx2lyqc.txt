You came over to my house
You never asked for anything back
But I meant everything I said

And now I see the problem has always been me
But at least I'm happier
Now I'm fine

And we can both care
But not have to be there
You said I taught you some things
That I'm not even sure I believe

And now I see the problem has always been me
But at least I'm happier
Now I'm fine

Now that's no longer true
The problem is only you
But at least you're happier
Now you're fine
