I can't stop killing the songs you like
You look at me with eyes
That could beat the sunrise in a contest
No question
Well, talk to all the others
And bring me back to earth
I'm thankful for your mother for what it's worth

Oh, all the memories we had
Framed in our minds like photographs
Take a second, take a second
And make this last
Here where the future meets the past
I can never fall in love again
I can never fall in love again

I can't stop moving cause I'll feel dead
Give me a second and I'll turn into a year you won't forget
We'll make read our stories
And we'll make them eat their words
We'll make their lives seem boring for what it's worth

Oh, all the memories we had
Framed in like photographs
Take a second, take a second
And make this last
Here where the future meets the past
I can never fall in love again
I can never fall in love again

I drink your poison and say
I'm still not going away
I'll swallow all your bombs and grenades
And love you like a tsunami wave
Wave, wave

Oh, all the memories we had
Framed in like photographs
Take a second, take a second
And make this last
Here where the future meets the past
I can never fall in love again
I can never fall in love again

Oh, all the memories
Framed in our minds
Take a second, take a second
And make this last, here for a while
I can never fall in love again
I can never fall in love again

Oh, all the memories
Framed in our minds
Take a second, take a second
And make this last, here for a while
I can never fall in love again
I can never fall in love again
Again
