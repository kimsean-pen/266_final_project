My head spins around mars
Ahead everyone's time, am I?
They saiyin' I was strange and yeah
That might be true, I got enough
problems to follow all of these rules
Ha-Ha
Looking around and they look
all the same gotta play the game right
catch the wave, I am up in there
I'm in the clouds
Launching my satellite to cover all of these crowds

I was deluded by mom
to the seven streets upon
You can be whatever you want
If it's yours then it can be done
I was deluded by mom

Get ready for some chain reaction
Dreamer boy, lights, camera & action
You'll go far, make no exception
Those were her words, so

I was deluded by mom
to the seven streets upon
You can be whatever you want
If it's yours then it can be done
I was deluded by mom

City lights city lights invite my eyes
Walking down the ave there flies my mind
Striking dancing moves
My mother saying they were good should be a
dancer now, put on some blues on
Race track, ra-ra-race track left it back in '93
to find me just trace track

Getting there everywhere, am I?
I'm anywhere
My mother said I could
Just getting there

I was deluded by mom
to the seven streets upon
You can be whatever you want
If it's yours then it can be done
I was deluded by mom

Get ready for some chain reaction
Dreamer boy, lights, camera & action
You'll go far, make no exception
Those were her words, so

Get ready for some chain reaction

You'll go far, make no exception
Those were her words, so

I was deluded by mom

to the seven streets upon
You can be whatever you want
If it's yours then it can be done
