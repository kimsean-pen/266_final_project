Force fed more than we eat in the wild
Graised on a mash that can suffocate a child
Bloaded, promoted in an ode to pompous style
Moistening their feet while we're choking on the bile
Cornering the market on the geese without the bones
Hushing down the public in a strike without a drone
The cage became collapsible, our sticks equiped with stones.
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone.

Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone

Hello Motherfucker
My lover
You saw it coming

Get the motherfucker on the phone

Set aside the scruples in the strategies of strain
A smallpox- laden blanket invisible with stains
Inoculated bastards, bloody pecked at pain
Distemper has a hold
Distemper has a hold
We took a second sip from a cup we made of bones
The first it was a ruse, a trick so aptly grown
The truth is that our youth was a carpet laid with stones
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone.

Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone

Hello Motherfucker
My lover
You saw it coming

Goodbye Motherfucker
You had it coming

Get the motherfucker on the phone
Get the motherfucker on the phone
Get the motherfucker on the phone
Get the motherfucker on the phone
Get the motherfucker on the phone
