It's just our human nature
You say you don't need that stuff
You're just not the same creature

Cause all you want is
Recreational love, love, love
You say you need your freedom
Recreational love, love, love
I just don't believe your reason

Give me all that you've got to give
All my girlfriends say
Tell me I'm the reason you've got to live
But you always say
You don't believe in love

You say you can't help yourself
You just have so many demons
I've heard that one before
It just makes your life so easy

Cause there's no such thing as
Recreational love, love, love
You say you want your freedom
Recreational love, love, love
I just don't believe your reason

Give me all that you've got to give
All my girlfriends say
Tell me I'm the reason you've got to live
But you always say
You don't believe in love

Ooh tell me something that I can believe
Cause you might give it up
But you're never going to give it up to me
I don't believe anything
And You believe in love
You just aren't in love with me

Give me all that you've got to give
All my girlfriends say
Tell me I'm the reason you've got to live
But you always say
You don't believe in love
