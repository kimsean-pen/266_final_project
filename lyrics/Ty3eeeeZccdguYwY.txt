All is quiet, empty streets,
All is quiet, the city sleeps,
Close my eyes,
On my knees,
And time is passing me by;
Time is passing me by,

I can't move, can't turn back;
Out of reach, my heart is black.
My silent shout
Won't set me free
And time is passing me by.

Time is passing me by. Time is passing me by. Time is passing me by.
