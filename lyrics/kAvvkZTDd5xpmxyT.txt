Don't Walk Away

See I just can't find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you'll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray

How can I stop losing you
How can I begin to say
When there's nothing left to do but walk away

(yeah)
I close my eyes

Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it's been so long now all I do is cry
Can't we find some love to take this away
‘Cause the pain gets stronger every day

How can I begin again
Now how am I to understand
When there's nothing left to do but walk away
(yeaah)

See now why
All my dreams been broken
I don't know where we're going

and everything we said and all we done now
Don't let go, I don't wanna walk away
(ow ow) (I) (ow ow)

Now why
All my dreams been broken
Don't know where we're going
When everything begins to set us free
Can't you see, I don't wanna walk away
If you go, I won't forget you girl(please if you go)
Can't you see that you will always be(you will always be)
Even though I had to let you go
There's nothing left to do Don't Walk Away
If you go, I won't forget you girl, Can't you see that you will always be (can you see - you and me)
Even though I had to let you go There's nothing left to do Don't Walk Away
