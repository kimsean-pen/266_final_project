Maybe I could let go, let go, let go

People think I look crazy
Picking fights with the clear blue wall
Hard to reach you lately
Straining my neck, just to talk
You got caught in the hunger
And I know it was chemical
Didn't plan to go under
But I took it personal

When you let those blue eyes turn grey
I took it personal
When you took my hero away
Death isn't personal

I scream at your ghost
When I miss you the most
I'll lace up my armour and fight for us both
Finish what you started and crown your stone

Maybe I could let go, let go, let go
Maybe I could let go, let go, let go

You know I'd say anything just to hear you yelling back
Trying to push 'till you cave in
But you'd never do your girl like that
Wanna know you're okay now 'cause I can't stay mad too long
Never said "keep it going"
And I took that personal

When you let those blue eyes turn grey
I took it personal
When you took my hero away
Death isn't personal

I scream at your ghost
When I miss you the most
I'll lace up my armour and fight for us both
Finish what you started and crown your stone

Maybe I could let go, let go, let go
Maybe I could let go, let go, let go
Maybe I could let go, let go, let go
Maybe I could let go, let go, let go

When you let those blue eyes turn grey
I took it personal
When you took my hero away
I took it personal
Now you're not here when I say
I took it personal
I took it personal
Now every night

I scream at your ghost
When I miss you the most
I'll lace up my armour and fight for us both
Finish what you started and crown your stone
(I'll crown your stone)
I scream at your ghost
When I miss you the most
I'll lace up my armour and fight for us both
Finish what you started and crown your stone

Maybe I could let go, let go, let go (maybe)
Maybe I could let go, let go, let go
(Never let go)
