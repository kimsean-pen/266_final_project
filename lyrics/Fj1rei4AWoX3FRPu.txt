You'll no longer be kissed and kind
As you long for intuition
As you have to learn the lesson twice
You'll no longer be kissed and kind
As you long for intuition
As you have to say the password twice

Have you ever?
Have you ever been all messed up?
Have you ever?

Have you ever?
Have you ever been all messed up?
Have you ever?

You're the pin card
You're the lifeguard
You're the information guide
Things look much bigger on your knees
On your knees

Miss the signal
Miss the signpost
Miss the exits to it all
And all of a sudden you were one
With the freaks

Have you ever?
Have you ever been all messed up?
Have you ever?

Have you ever?
Have you ever been all messed up?
Have you ever?

Have you ever?
Have you ever been all messed up?
Have you ever?

Have you ever?
Have you ever been all messed up?
Have you ever?
