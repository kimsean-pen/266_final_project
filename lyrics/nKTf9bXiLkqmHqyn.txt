Sky above my head
Open mind
And I try to think
Think of all these words
Should have said
Didn't want to escape
From this dream
Where I want to be

And the thing that I feel
You'll never know
I am really afraid of telling the truth
And the thing that I feel
You'll never know
I am really afraid of losing you

Wish you knew how much
I've been wanting to talk to you
Still carry me
Nothing's changed
Sky above my head
For the first time
Since I lost your smile

And the thing that I feel
You'll never know
I am really afraid of telling the truth
And the thing that I feel
You'll never know
I am really afraid of losing you
Still carry me...
