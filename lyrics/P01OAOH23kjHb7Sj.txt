Yeah, I don't fuck with society
I just feel like it's a lie to me
Feel the resentment inside of me
I could feel the reaper trying me
I could never be the nice guy
I could never see the bright side
'Cause we all get around in the hearses
So I don't really see the purpose
Roll around in the Subie
Way back when you knew me
Things change and I'm blowing up
They keep telling me I'm blowing up
It's been a minute, I've been around
I've been alone and it's funny how
Every day when I leave the house
I wish that I hadn't, and I'm leaving now

Yeah, cold blood, black heart
I can see your lies in your eyes
And it's hard
To act like I'm fine
No I've seen better times
Think I've had it
I think I've had it

You're just another reason why I stay inside
Just another reason why I hate this life
This has been a long time coming, I swear
This has been a long time coming, I swear
And I can't seem to let go of the hate inside
Every time I'm close I go and change my mind
This has been a long time coming, I swear
This has been a long time coming, I swear

Motorola Razr keep that shit on my waist
Haven't felt you laugh since 2008
Got the doors locked and the blinds closed
Fuck your fake fame and your nice clothes
Looking around I can only see
All of the demons around me
Do what you do, it's astounding
Losing my grip and I'm drowning
Same shit, different day
I'm insane, stay away
I can see, all the lies
Cutting ties too late

Cold blood, black heart
I can see your lies in your eyes
And it's hard
To act like I'm fine
No I've seen better times
Think I've had it
I think I've had it

You're just another reason why I stay inside
Just another reason why I hate this life
This has been a long time coming, I swear
This has been a long time coming, I swear
And I can't seem to let go of the hate inside
Every time I'm close I go and change my mind
This has been a long time coming, I swear
This has been a long time coming, I swear

Cold blood, black heart
I can see your lies in your eyes
And it's hard
To act like I'm fine
No I've seen better times
Think I've had it
I think I've had it

Yeah, cold blood, black heart
I can see your lies in your eyes
And it's hard
To act like I'm fine
No I've seen better times
Think I've had it
I think I've had it

You're just another reason why I stay inside
Just another reason why I hate this life
This has been a long time coming, I swear
This has been a long time coming, I swear
And I can't seem to let go of the hate inside
Every time I'm close I go and change my mind
This has been a long time coming, I swear
This has been a long time coming, I swear
