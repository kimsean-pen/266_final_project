The clock on the wall, it never stops ticking
It feels almost new but I've been here before
I wait for your call but it's never coming
And I'm always running away

Sick of "God has a plan"
Things happen for a reason
It feels so unfair that it happened this way
The clock on the wall, it never stops ticking
But you're time was cut short

I've been seeing your face in the steady glow
Of the torch I hold
As your flame just burned out so
So suddenly

We said no goodbyes
The last thing you told me was
"See you next month, when the leaves start to fall"
I know that you're gone, I can't help but wonder
If you can still hear me now
The funeral home
The man at the podium, he said "Jesus saves"
But what did he save you from?
No goodbyes
The last words you told me are ringing in my head

I've been seeing your face in the steady glow
Of the torch I hold
But your flame just burned out so
'Cause your flame just burned out so
So suddenly

I'd got back to your house on Maine
But I don't wanna relive all the pain
It's been two years since you left on that September day
I take care of your guitars and your radio collection
Promise it's in loving hands
Two years, I still think about you everyday

The clock on the wall, it never stops ticking
It feels almost new but I've been here before
I wait for your call but it's never coming
And I'm always running away
Yeah, I'm always running away

I've been seeing your face in the steady glow
Of the torch I hold
But your flame just burned out so
Are you at the top of the world
Or the back of my mind?
But your flame just burned out so
And your flame just burned out so
Suddenly

So suddenly
