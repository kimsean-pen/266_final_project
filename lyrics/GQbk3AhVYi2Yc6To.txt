Bearer of Sword
stands beyond (the) Triumphant
As Eternal Night falls
on the Planet of (almost full) Void

Weaves War with a gesture of Might
Fallen are the Souls
Blinded by the Warrior Dreams
Finds the star invisible
to most of the regular Men and Slaves

and The Master serves Him

Leaves then for the Last Time
Finally His Castle
Monument of Misanthropy and Wrath
Hate
Loyal Friend of His Sober Hours
Treads on while the Faith Whips Sharp
mental pain makes His Eyes Gleam
A light made of Dark Thrones and Frozen Winds
Now can leave the planet
