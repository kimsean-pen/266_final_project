Liturgies and prophecies they mean nothing to me
I believe in substance not the patterns that you see
Life burns me alive
Life burns me alive
Straws you grip so tightly now becoming your own noose
Story collapsing, ask yourself, "Can you hang from your own truth?"
Life burns me alive
Life burns me alive

Sever the hand
Of any god or man
Sever the hand
To free yourself again
Free yourself again
Sever the hand
Of any god or man (of any god or man)
Sever the hand
To free yourself again
Free yourself again

Go!

Mindlessly crawling, you're choked by a leash
Seeking redemption, you practice and preach
Cognitive failure, your sickness reveals
The horror and panic exposing what's real

Life burns me alive
Life burns me alive

Sever the hand
Of any god or man
Sever the hand
To free yourself again
Free yourself again
Sever the hand
Of any god or man (of any god or man)
Sever the hand
To free yourself again
Free yourself again
