Blind by your prism love
We were caught in a reckless flame
And the lies told we can't take back now
We almost had it all
But now we're left in chains

Oh we started a war
There's no turning back
There's no turning back
'Til we come down

Heartbeats full of fire
Now we're caught up in emotion
Cut me with your lies
Now we're never gonna slow down
We keep bleeding love
'Til we come down
We keep bleeding love
'Til we come down
'Til we come down
'Til we come down
Already over it now

Caught in your line of fire
Had a hold and a can't escape
Put me down with your cruel desire
The writing's on the wall but we're too blind to see

Oh we started a war
There's no turning back
There's no turning back
'Til we come down

Heartbeats full of fire
Now we're caught up in emotion
Cut me with your lies
Now we're never gonna slow down
We keep bleeding love
'Til we come down
We keep bleeding love
'Til we come down
'Til we come down
'Til we come down
Already over it now

Gone
And I can't breath
We could, we could run
We could, we could
Every little thing we hold
But we can't leave
We could, we could run
We could, we could

'Til we come down

Heartbeats full of fire
Now we're caught up in emotion
Cut me with your lies
Now we're never gonna slow down
We keep bleeding love
'Til we come down
We keep bleeding love
'Til we come down
'Til we come down
'Til we come down
Already over it now
