It's not that I don't want to see it through
You're only young once or twice
It's just that I don't want to see you around
Your absence means just as much
It means just as much
Don't wanna know where you're running to next
I've tried my hand at it all
No more mystery than thrill
To the killer than its kill
This taste of jealousy and still one day
It alters to dust

So what if you're undone
I am never coming down
So what if you're undone
I am never coming down
Down to you

So what if you're undone
I am never coming down
So what if you're undone
I am never coming down
