I live on an apartment
On the ninety-ninth floor of my block
And I sit at home lookin' out the window
Imaginin' the world has stopped

Then in flies a guy
Who's all dressed up just like the Union Jack
He says "I would drive around
If I had his kind of detergent pack"

I said, "Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud baby"

The telephone is ringin'
I say, "Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line?"
A voice says, "Hi, hello, how are you?
Well, I guess I'm doin' fine"

It's three a.m., there's too much noise
Don't you people ever wanna go to bed?
'Cause you feel so good
Do you have to drive me out of my head?

I said, "Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud baby"

I was sick and tired, fed up with this
And decided to take a drive downtown
It was so very quiet and peaceful
There was nobody, not a soul around

I laid myself out
I was so tired and I started to dream
In the mornin' the parkin' tickets were just like a flag
Stuck on my windscreen

I said, "Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud"

Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around, baby, two's a crowd
On my cloud
