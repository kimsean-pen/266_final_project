Whoa, there's something on my mind
Won't somebody please, please tell me what's wrong?

(You're just a fool, you know you're in love) What you say?
(You've got to face it to live in this world) Hey, hey, hey, yes
(You take the good along with the bad) Whoa-ah
(Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad) One more time
(You know you love him, you can't understand) Down the side
(Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man)

Yes, he's got me smilin' when I should be ashamed
Got me laughin' when my heart is in pain
Whoa, now, I must be a fool
But I'll do anything he wants me to
Now, why?

(You're just a fool, you know you're in love) Tell me one more time
(You've got to face it to live in this world) Hey, hey, hey, yes
(You take the good along with the bad) Whoa, yes
(Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad) One more time
(You know you love him, you can't understand) Down the side
(Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man)

And listen, without the man I don't wanna live
You think I'm lyin' but I'm tellin' you like it is
He's got my nose open and that's no lie
And I-I'm gonna keep him satisfied
Now, why?

(You're just a fool, you know you're in love) Tell me now
(You've got to face it to live in this world) Hey, hey, hey, yes
(You take the good along with the bad) Whoa, yes
(Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad) One more time
(You know you love him, you can't understand) Down the side
(Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man)

Yes, way of action speaks louder than words
The truest thing that I ever heard
I trust the man and all that he do
And I-I'll do anything he wants me to
Now, why?

(You're just a fool, you know you're in love) Tell me one more time
(You've got to face it to live in this world) Hey, hey, hey, yes
(You take the good along with the bad) Whoa, yes
(Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad) Tell me one more time
(You know you love him, you can't understand) Whoa-oh
(Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man)

Tell me
(Doo-doo, doo, doo)
Tell me one more time
(Doo-doo, doo, doo)
Yeah, hey, hey
