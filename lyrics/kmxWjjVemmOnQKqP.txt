The deadly waves of this crimson sea
Are getting stronger, stronger
We have no choice, so we dive right in
We're going under, going under
To seek the prize we were meant to win
But is it worth it, is it worth it
As overwhelming obscurity
Is taking over, taking over?

Dama de sol y estrellas
Protégenos del mal

You've become a monster
Aching to devour the world
Spread you wings and flee
From the Earth to the stars

The men in charge gave no guarantees
We're on you own now, on our own now
Trying to shake off this cruel disease
But we don't know how, we don't know how

Niña de manos blancas
Calma la tempestad
Y líbranos de todo mal

You've become a monster
Aching to devour the world
With your sharpened teeth
And a shattered heart
Take all you want
But nothing will bring you calm

Spread your wings and flee
To the farthest star

Niña de manos blancas
Calma la tempestad
Y líbranos de toto mal

You've become a monster
Aching to devour the world
Spread your wings and flee
You've become a monster
Aching to devour the world
With your sharpened teeth
And a shattered heart.
Your search will last forever
The deadly waves of this crimson sea
Are getting stronger, stronger
We have no choice, so we dive right in
We're going under, going under
To seek the prize we were meant to win
But is it worth it, is it worth it
As overwhelming obscurity
Is taking over, taking over?

Dama de sol y estrellas

You've become a monster
Aching to devour the world
Spread you wings and flee
From the Earth to the stars

Y líbranos de todo mal

Take all you want

Aching to devour the world

Your search will last forever.
