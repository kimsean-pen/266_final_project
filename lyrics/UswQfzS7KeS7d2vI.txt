Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
so lucky to be loving you
so lucky to be
the one you run to see
in the evening when the day is through

I only know what I know
the passing years will show
you've kept my love so young, so new

And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
so lucky to be loving you.

I only know what I know
the passing years will show
you've kept my love so young, so new

And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
so lucky to be loving you.
