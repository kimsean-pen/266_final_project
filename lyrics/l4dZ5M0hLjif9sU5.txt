Now if you love me please don't tease
If I can hold well then let me squeeze
My heart goes round and round
My love comes tumbling down
You leave me ahhhh breathless ahhhh

Well I shake all over and you know why
I'm sure it's love honey it ain't no lie
'Cause when you call my name
I know I burn like wood in flame
You leave me so breathless ahhhh

Oh baby, you're driving me crazy
You're much too much
I can not love you enough
It's alright, hold me tight
When you love me, love me right

Come on, baby, now don't be shy
This love was meant for you and I
Wind, rain, sleet or snow
I'm gonna getcha wherever you go
You leave me breathless ahhhh

Oh baby, you're driving me crazy
You're much too much
I can not love you enough
It's alright, hold me tight
When you love me, love me right

Come on, baby, now don't be shy
This love was meant for you and I
Wind, rain, sleet or snow
I'm gonna getcha wherever you go
You leave me
Breathless ahhhh
