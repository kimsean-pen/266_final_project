There is a secret
I found a secret
Behind a Soho door
There is a reason
I found a reason
Beneath the subway floor
I found the water
The devil's water
And walked along its shore

Is that what you want?

The channel's changing
The heart is racing
From voices on the wire
The soul is yearning
The coal is burning
The ember starts a fire
Can we recover
Love for each other
The measure of your life

Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want?
A river
A river
A river running underground
A river
A river
Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want?

I... I...
I am a river
I... I...
I am your river
I... I...
I am a river
I... I...
I am your river

Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want?
I... I...
I am a river
I... I...
I am a river
I... I...
I am a river
I... I...
I am your river

I am a river
I... I...
I am your river
I... I...
I am a river
I... I...
I am your river
