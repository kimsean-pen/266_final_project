My heart breaks,
The trust is broken.
Concrete flashes,
And my death rushes.

'Til the end of the day,
'Til the end of the line,
'Til the end of the world,
'Til the end of the night.

You will put flowers,
Over the earth where I sleep

I know in your heart,
I was not meant to keep.

'Til the end of the day,
'Til the end of the line,
'Til the end of the world,
'Til the end of the night.

My heart breaks everything,
You are closer.
You cry wolf,
And I show up.
