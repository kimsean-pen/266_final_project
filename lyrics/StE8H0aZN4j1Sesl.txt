Yesterday I saw the sun shinin'
And the leaves were fallin' down softly
And my cold hands needed a warm, warm touch
And I was thinkin' about you

But here I am lookin' for signs to lead me
You hold my hand but do you really need me?
I guess it's time for me to let you go
But I'll be thinkin' about you
I'll be thinkin' about you

So when you sail across the ocean waters
And you reach the other side safely
Well could you smile a little smile for me?
'Cause I'll be thinkin' about you

I'll be thinkin' about you
I'll be thinkin' about you
I'll be thinkin' about you
