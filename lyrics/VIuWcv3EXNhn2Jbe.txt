Pig that is soaked in soup of crime
It is a pain of the children whom you murdered
Hate yourself

In the maze without an end...
Why do you still breathe?

瓦礫の下で真実がのたうち回る絵は何よりも深い

孤独 憎悪 嫉妬 不安 虚無に咲いた無表情 何よりも重い

惨状覆う 不条理に思えた笑う青空

In the maze without an end... 過ちに溺れ
In the maze without an end... Why do you still breathe?

Sorrow made you
In the bottom of the dark sea
Sorrow made you
償い続け... And die

Pig that is soaked in soup of crime...

In the maze without an end...「Hate yourself」過ちに溺れ
In the maze without an end...「Hate yourself」Why do you still breathe?

Sorrow made you
In the bottom of the dark sea
Sorrow made you
愛情も知らぬ孤独なパレード
Sorrow made you
In the bottom of the dark sea
Sorrow made you
償い続け... And die

Sorrow made you
In the maze without an end... Why do you still breathe?
