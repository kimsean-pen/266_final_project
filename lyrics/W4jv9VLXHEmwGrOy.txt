We are all trapped in prisons of the mind,
it's a hard sensibility
but we'll see it through in time
but when words come between us
Noiseless in the air
Believe me, I know it's so easy to despair.

but don't
Tonight i'm talking to myself
There's no one that I know as well
Thoughts collide without a sound
Frantic, fighting to be found

And I've found things in this life
that still are real
a remainder refusing to be concealed
And I've found the answer lies in a real emotion
Not the self-indulgence of a self-devotion

Too many situations
Left with too little to say
So we try, we try to feel our way
And if decisions cause divisions
Tell me who's to blame?
Pick a target for convenience
When there are other ways

So don't
Tonight i'm talking to myself
There's no one that I know as well
Thoughts collide without a sound
Frantic, fighting to be found

And I've found things in this life
that still are real
a remainder refusing to be concealed
I've found the answer lies in a real emotion
Not the self-indulgence of a self-devotion
