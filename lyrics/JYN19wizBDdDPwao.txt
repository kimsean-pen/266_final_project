I remember your silhouette
On Dyes Inlet
Against the silver sheen
Of a moon like painted glass
Under stars out on a pier;
A celestial sphere
We were weightless
As the waves that disappeared

Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized

We shared a clove
Cigarette on the parapet
As the TVs glowed from
The windows of the model homes
And I'd never be that close
Again to your lips and perfect skin
As the tide receded into the unknown

Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized

Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized

I remember your silhouette
On Dyes Inlet

Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized

Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized
