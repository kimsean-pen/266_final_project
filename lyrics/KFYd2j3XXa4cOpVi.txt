Tell me where the wind is blowin'
'Cause that's where the music's going
You are my big dark blue
And I wanna swim all around you
You are the sweetest melody I never sung

I feel like I know you but you're just a ghost to me
But when I sit beside your shadow
Somehow it comforts me
You are the sweetest melody I never sung
You are my island of love my remedy to rescue me
You are a breeze of a song that carries me
You are the sweetest melody I never sung

La, la la la la la la la la la la la
La, la la la la la la la la la la la
La, la

I've got a hole the size of your touch
That fits in your arms as much
And when I try to fill it up the hole gets bigger every time
You are the sweetest melody I never sung
You are the sweetest melody I never sung

You are my island of love my remedy to rescue me
You are a breeze of a song that carries me
You are the sweetest melody I never sung

Corta corta mi luna mi luna ya
Esta melodia que es la misma que
A la misma que
