EMILY:
The town where she was born
Like the town where I was born
Was built by white settlers seeking gold and other treasures
Like me, she feels uncomfortable in the clothing of her ancestors
It's not easy, she would say
Ripping her fingers into the ashtray
It's not easy to erase your blood

JIMMY:
Rock me now
EMILY:
Ahem, sing with me
JIMMY:
In the arms of cobwebs
Roll me out
In the arms of cobwebs

EMILY:
Next she found a man to treasure
And together they planted flowers of warning, fearing frost
Late on shallow evenings while their enemies slept
They hammered the soil, asking for answers in green
His value declined when he offered his name
Why did he offer?

JIMMY:
His value declined...
EMILY:
Ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
JIMMY:
When he offered his name
EMILY:
Ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
JIMMY:
His value declined
EMILY:
Ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
JIMMY:
When he offered his name

EMILY:
When she was seven years old she saw a man get shot, but
No one came for a long time,
Because it happened in a remote parking lot in Las Vegas
She was waiting for her mom to come back
From working the blackjack table at the Circus-Circus casino and
That night her mom said that the two of them, and the now dead guy
Were the only three people who ever really lived in Las Vegas
Everybody else just arrived,
Ate their complimentary shrimp cocktail
And left.

JIMMY:
Rock me now
In the arms of cobwebs
EMILY:
It's a one-room city, yeah, it's a one-room city here
So can you roll me
JIMMY:
Roll me out
In the arms of cobwebs
EMILY:
It's a one-room city, yeah, it's a one-room city here
JIMMY:
His value declined
EMILY:
Ah ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
JIMMY:
When he offered his name
EMILY:
You rent a one-room city here,
It's a one-room city here
The wall-to-wall-to-wall-to-wall
Goes street to street to street.
