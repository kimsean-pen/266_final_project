hey!

you said you needed full time help
cos you're all alone
i said i'd work for nothing at all
if i just could take you home

and now you're taking applications
for your love
you wanted certain specifications
i circled the one that said all the above

work... for love

finally got my resume
and you said you'd reviewed it some other day
i said, 'girl, hey, do it if you dare
where i'd like to go our love will flare'

finally my letter arrived
and i knew you would be mine
instead i had to prove my turf
for the first two weeks work overtime

work... for love

you've got to work

you've got to work for love (had enough, had enough?)
