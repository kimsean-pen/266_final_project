Every mornin' I would wake up
And I'd tie the sun around a cup
I felt your love, higher than the sky
No one in this world, but you and I
Had tasted love so sweet
You held me in your arms, soft as the rain

Ohh, mi amore
My love never dies
Mi amore
Look into my eyes

We had a love so high
(High)
I could never walk away, baby
(Never walk away)
A love so high
(High)
I could reach out and touch the skies
(Touch the skies)
Tell me why?
I say, a little prayer for you and I
(I say, a little prayer for you and I)
You had a love so high
(I say, a little prayer for you and I)

Now I wake up, in the middle of the night
Your face in front of me
Like a candle burning, brighter than the flame
I see everything inside your eyes
Your smile, your touch, your alibis
Wish that you could be with me all night

Ohh mi amore
I wish that I could fly
(I wish that I could fly)
Mi amore
Look into my eyes
(Into my eyes)

We had a love so high
(High)
I could never walk away, baby
(Never walk away)
A love so high
(High)
I could reach out and touch the sky
(Touch the sky)
Tell me why?
I say, a little prayer for you and I
(I say, a little prayer for you and I)
You had a love so high
(I say, a little prayer for you and I)

Ohh mi amore
My love never dies
(My love never dies)
Mi amore
Look into my eyes
(Look into my eyes)

We had a love so high
(High)
I still need you everyday, baby
(Aah aah)
A love so high
(High)
And time's ticking away
(Away)
Tell me why?
I say a little prayer for you and I
(I said a little prayer for you and I)
I still need you everyday, baby
(I say a little prayer for you and I)
We had a love so high
(High)
I would never, never walk away
(Never walk away)
A love so high
(High)
I could reach out and touch the skies
(Touch the skies)
Tell me why?
I can't see you anymore
I can't see you anymore, oh oh
(I said a little prayer for you and I)
See you anymore
(I said a little prayer for you and I)
See you anymore
(Haa aah)
See you anymore
(Haa aah haa)
See you anymore, more, more
(Haa aah haa)
I can't never, never walk away
Never walk away
