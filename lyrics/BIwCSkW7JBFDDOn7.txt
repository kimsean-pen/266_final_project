When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break started
And when the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me
B-Rock, uh, Darkchild
We back
You'll be right here with me
You'll be right here with me

When your life is going too fast
Off the train tracks, I can slow it down
Just when you think you're 'bout to turn back
Scared you might crash, I'll be your ground (woah)

When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break started
And when the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me
When your tears have dried from cryin'
And the world has turned silent
And when the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me

I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me, yeah

And when you're trapped and there's just no key
And you can't breathe, I'll breathe for you
The fire's got you down on both knees
And the walls are closing in, but I'll be breaking through
And when you feel alone, I'ma be your home
When others come and go, you know I got you

And when you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break started
And when the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me (you'll see the sun)
When your tears have dried from cryin'
And the world has turned silent
And when the clouds have all departed
You 'll be right here with me

I will be here right beside you
Every step you take, yeah
I will be your strength, your shelter
Shield you from the rain
Oh, when you feel

When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break started
And when the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me (right here)
When your tears have dried from cryin' (we ain't never goin' nowhere)
And the world has turned silent (gonna tell the world we're here)
And when the clouds have all departed (no, ne-ne-never depart, oh)
You 'll be right here with me

And when you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break started
And when the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me (right here with me)
When your tears have dried from cryin'
And the world has turned silent
And when the clouds have all departed
You 'll be right here with me

I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me, yeah
