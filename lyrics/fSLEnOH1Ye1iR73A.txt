No one makes me feel the way you do inside
And I don't know what I would do without you and that's no lie

If I die, I'd hope to find you in another life
So we could fall again
Be the way we were when we first began
Like the first time that I ever saw you smile
I want that feeling again
Let's be the way we were when we first began

Yes, we've got something special, let's hope
Hold on and don't let go
And I'll never find another like you and this I know

If I die, I'd hope to find you in another life
So we could fall again
Let's be the way we were when we first began
Like the first time that I ever saw you smile
I want that feeling again
Let's be the way we were when we first began

When we first began
When we first began
When we first began
When we first began
