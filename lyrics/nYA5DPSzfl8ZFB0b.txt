I fight
With my demons, with my demons inside
I... I'm never gonna go away
I'm gonna lead this way
I've been praying
To be safe
Put on
Put the shield on
Come on
You're a winner, you're a winner
Ayo
There comes the beast
Ayo
I won't bare my teeth
No enemy
Ayo
No I won't give in
Ayo
To the fear within
Won't hide again under the sheets
Tonight
Ayo, Ayo
No enemy
Ayo, ayo
No enemy
When everything I felt so rough
Has made me feel so strong
I go higher, I go higher, I go higher
And on
Put on
Put the shield on
Come on
You're a winner, you're a winner
Ayo
There comes the beast
Ayo
I won't bare my teeth
No enemy
Ayo
No I won't give in
Ayo
To the fear within
Won't hide again under the sheets
Tonight
You're a winner
Ayo
When my demons come alive
I just sing a lullaby
I won't hide again under the sheets
No enemy
Tonight
Ayo
When your demons come alive
Try to sing a lullaby
No you won't hide
No enemy
Tonight
There comes the beast
Ayo
I won't bare my teeth
No enemy
Ayo
No I won't give in
Ayo
To the fear within
Won't hide again under the sheets
Tonight
