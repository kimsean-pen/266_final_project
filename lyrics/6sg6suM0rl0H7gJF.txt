Blessed with an eye
To see things as they are
Will you draw me?

Up there on the wall
Looking down to us all
You never saw me

I found a pen
And I outlined a life
You've never cried
I think I saw a tear in your eye

Your eyes tell the tale
I will not ask again
Now I see what you've lost
Nothing is quite the same

By the love of my Heart
Cut my drawing in half
For I think I'm like you
Should you draw me

Waiting for my evenfall

Farewell, my passion
You slowly turn pale
I will long for your warmth
Made me feel safe

I will not draw again
'Til I know it's my time
I have lived a long life
Should I draw me

Morning's here, I must have...
...Failed

...Someone save me...
