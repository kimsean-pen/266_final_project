I've seen pictures of a bright sun shining in face
And I know it
I've heard stories of a child not yet out of place
So well, I remember this
Through it all I've Learned so much about you
What a dirty shame
So blinding a self righteous point of view
How many fingers is this

You can't take it all back, Take it back
You did it, you said it now you will regret it
You can't take it all back, Take it back
You did it, you said it now you will regret it
You can't wreck my world with the things you do
You can't take it all back, take it all back
You did it, you said it now you will regret it
Now you're gonna regret it

It started just like a dream
It started just like a dream
Smiles turned upside down
Good times 180 around
What a devil your god has made of you
How do his words taste
Wich finger does he use when he points at you
I bet I know this
You can't take it all back, Take it back
You did it, you said it now you will regret it
You can't take it all back, Take it back
You did it, you said it now you will regret it
You can't wreck my world with the things you do
You can't take it all back, take it all back
You did it, you said it now you will regret it
Now you're gonna regret it
Now you're gonna...

Why did you cross the line I drew
Only you can adore you
And why did you throw the words you threw
I can never forgive you

Only you can adore you...

You can't take it all back, Take it back
You did it, you said it now you will regret it
You can't take it all back, Take it back
You did it, you said it now you will regret it
You can't wreck my world with the things you do
You can't take it all back, take it all back
You did it, you said it now you will regret it
Now you're gonna regret it
Yeah, you gonna.
Now you're gonna regret it
Now you're gonna regret it
Now you're gonna regret it
