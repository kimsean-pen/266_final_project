Put that on my life, everything I love
Never crossed no line
It was all because I dedicate my life
To lovin' you right
Love comes before pride, I loved you before I-I-I-I
'fore I even knew why

How did we get away from love?
How did love get away from us?
Not my time, I should wait for love
Waste of time, what a waste of love

You became my life, put that on my life
Took me out my mind, took my peace of mind
I never realized you were my light
Without you by my side, that just don't feel right

Only been a week I think I'm weak can't even
I can't even eat, can't sleep, when we ain't speakin'
What you telling me boy that's a real weak reason
You cut me so deep, it hurts for me to breathe in

How did we get away from love?
How did love get away from us?
Not our time, we should wait for love
Waste of time, what a waste of love
You're my wasted love

You're confused so you
Do not know the truth
Listen to your heart, wish you knew your heart
Wish you knew what it sound like
Wish you knew what it felt like
Wish you knew I was down for life
Wish you really was 'bout that life
Wish you knew I was the one
Wish you knew what you wanted
You should do what you wanna
You can do what you want 'cause
I'm gon' set you free, yeah
Visions of you leaving me, yeah
Next thing I know you're leaving me
No tellin' where you were leading me, leading me
You're leaving me

How did we get away from love?
How did love get away from us?
Not my time, I should wait for love
Waste of time, what a waste of love
You're my wasted love, wasted love
