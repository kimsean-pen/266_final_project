Three words you have spoken,
don't make me a fool.
as a gesture, a token
please play by the rules.

please play by the rules.
please play by the rules.

if i knew a way out,
from breaking your heart.
was it free for the taking?
to tear it apart?
to tear you apart?
to tear you apart?

there can be no mistaking,
tell me quick as you can.
'cause i'm so tired faking.

what we understand.
what we understand.
what we understand.
what we understand.
