You can't keep me sane when I'm out of sight
I still lose my way from time to time
You can't keep me sane when I'm out of sight
I promise I'll fight but I can't promise that I'll be fine

You treated the damage that I let reside in my fragile mind
With stitches and bandage
You took the fault of my scars and you made it ours

I feel at home when you're lying next to me
But I fall apart when an ocean's in between

You can't keep me sane when I'm out of sight
I still lose my way from time to time
You can't keep me sane when I'm out of sight
I promise I'll fight but I can't promise that I'll be fine

I can't promise that I'll be fine
I can't promise that I'll be fine

My life's been unravelin'
As my legs give way to the crushing weight
Of the shame I've been battling
You're my one true north when I veer off course

I feel at home when you're lying next to me
But I fall apart when an ocean's in between

You can't keep me sane when I'm out of sight
I still lose my way from time to time
You can't keep me sane when I'm out of sight
I promise I'll fight but I can't promise that I'll be fine

I can't promise that I'll be fine
I can't promise that I'll be fine

Keep me in your mind
I'm spinning out of control, more than I want you to know
Keep me by your side
I'm spinning out of control, more than I want you to know
I survey the damage
Haunting me again, will it ever end?
The stitches and bandage
They're a short term cure until the pain returns

You can't keep me sane when I'm out of sight
I still lose my way from time to time
You can't keep me sane when I'm out of sight
I promise I'll fight, yeah I promise I'll fight
You can't keep me sane when I'm out of sight
I still lose my way from time to time
'Cause you saved my life more times than I'd like
I promise I'll fight but I can't promise that I'll be fine
