The key to this culture
Never slow down
Keep running with the vultures
They want to pull you back down
So you can't get out, no you can't get out

Is it really worth it?
Running with the crowd
Pretend everything's perfect
And it will all work out
Now you can't slow down, now you can't slow

Are you holding on?
Are you holding on too long?
I've been holding on
And I don't want to pretend
I don't want to pretend

They don't want you think
They don't wanna talk
They don't wanna dream
They don't want you to see that
The king of the culture is never really free

They don't want you think
They don't wanna talk
They don't wanna dream
They don't want you to see that
The king of the culture is never really free

Is it really worth it?
Running your mouth
It doesn't matter what you say
You let the words fall out
Now you can't slow down
Now you can't slow

Are you holding on?
Are you holding on too long?
I've been holding on
And I don't want to pretend
I don't want to pretend

They don't want you think
They don't wanna talk
They don't wanna dream
They don't want you to see that
The king of the culture is never really free

They don't want you think
They don't wanna talk
They don't wanna dream
They don't want you to see that
The king of the culture is never really free

The king of the culture is never really free
The king of the culture is never really free
The king of the culture is never really free
Never really free
Never really free

They don't want you think
They don't wanna talk
They don't wanna dream
They don't want you to see that
The king of the culture is never really free

They don't want you think
They don't wanna talk
They don't wanna dream
They don't want you to see that
The king of the culture is never really free
