We are in line, we are the trend
Brushed and forgotten in the end
Across the years we've lost each other
Blinded by a softly souther

I touch your skin, I hold my breath
The time has come, our love is dead
I watch the train as it dissolves in heavy rain
On tracks out of the blind lane

From the heaven of together to the earth of alone
Change your world before it kills you
There's no doubt this is what it's all about

We are in line, we are the trend
Brushed and forgotten in the end
Across the years we've lost each other
Blinded by a softly souther

I'm losing sleep, you're on my mind
I'm losing days that I cannot find
There's nothing wrong with being wrong for each other
At some time or another

From the heaven of together to the earth of alone
Change your world before it kills you
There's no doubt this is what it's all about

We are in line, we are the trend
Brushed and forgotten in the end
Across the years we've lost each other
Blinded by a softly souther

When it's all said and it's all done
We give up before it even begun
When it's all cold, when it's all gone
We stand still even if we try to run
When it's all said and it's all done
We give up before it even begun
When it's all cold, when it's all gone
We stand still even when we try to run

We are in line, we are the trend
Brushed and forgotten in the end
Across the years weэму lost each other
Blinded by a softly souther
