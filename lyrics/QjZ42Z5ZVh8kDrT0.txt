Daddy wanted you to leave it, Indiana, Indiana in the cold
Said "you know you really don't need it, leave the fame for the road"
I remember when I was leaving, I was only six years old
Oh how my heart was beatin', about ready to explode
One shot honey collect it all, the dust inside the rusted souls
You should get a ride cause you can't control the hear that beats under the bone
Come on my combat chameleon give it up, you've got your life to attend to,
buttercup, you're entertaining the talk that is told through the teeth of the mouths of
the millions dyin' to meet ya—
Little do they know
Said the Mississippi river won't kill you, unless you stand too close my dear
Take you to Louisiana a long long way from here
And the war's been a long time coming, yes a long long war's gonna come
We're standing at the end of a story, at the foot of a palindrome
One shot honey collect it all, the dust inside the rusted souls
You should get a ride cause you can't control the hear that beats under the bone
Come on my combat chameleon give it up, you've got your life to attend to,
buttercup, you're entertaining the talk that is told through the teeth of the mouths of
the millions dyin' to meet ya—
Little do they know
