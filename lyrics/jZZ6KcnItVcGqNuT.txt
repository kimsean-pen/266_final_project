Chairs next to the windows
Carpets touch the halls
Time slides through the windows
And slips behind the walls

In the dark of night
Or in the light of day

Underneath the painting
Where it once was clear
Well I was rolled in water
I was rolled out past the pier

In the tray of colors
The whirlwind appears
