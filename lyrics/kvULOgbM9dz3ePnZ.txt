Lakes of fire
Filled with regret
Took your chances
Your losses won't let you forget

Drown the liars and the thieves

So you think that it's over?
So you think that it's done?
The fields of unforgiveness never die, they've just begun

So you think that it's over?
So you think that it's done?
The fields of unforgiveness never die, they've just begun
