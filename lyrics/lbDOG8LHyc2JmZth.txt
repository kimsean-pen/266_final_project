sleep becomes
a shelter from
a memory half dead
the house is full of spiders now
there's a rage inside my head
obsession wears your wedding gown
down to a thread
and this heartless wilderness
held you as you bled

a way

terrified and locked inside
regretting every day
says "better just to kill it now
before it gets away"
do with me what you will
yea, anything's okay
this heartless wilderness
feels so far away
