I don't feel right in society
The twisted world
Fuck the guns and mythologies
The old time fears
The things we think we need

Hold on tighter to me, baby
Don't let me go
We got miles and miles of country
Before we're home

I sing the songs
That my idols sing
But they're all cold
And I will follow them to the grave
But now we ride
And we'll stay free

Free, like the love you gave
Free, to live out our days

Hold on tighter to me, baby
Don't let me go
We got miles and miles of country
Before we're home

Hold on tighter to me, baby
Don't let me go
We got miles and miles of country
Before we're home
