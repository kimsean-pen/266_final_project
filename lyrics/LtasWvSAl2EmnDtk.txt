I've got ambition, I did the rounds
You got invested now you're taking me out
I'm nothing to you, that's what you like
I'm just a battery to keep you energized

But, if you see me coming
Pretend that I'm the only one
I like your lies
If you see me coming
You better show me your love
I like your lies

There's a hollow inside you
And it won't disappear
Oh no, baby don't worry I'll be girl of all the year
There's a hollow inside you
But, don't worry I'm here (I'm here)
I don't care if you're looking for the next girl of the year
Girl of the year

Somebody younger, with longer hair
When you want someone, clap your hands and she's there
No expectations and no regrets
I knew what I was in for as soon as we met

If you see me coming
Pretend that I'm the only one
I like your lies
If you see me coming
You better show me your love
I like your lies

There's a hollow inside you
And it won't disappear
Oh no, baby don't worry I'll be girl of all the year
There's a hollow inside you
But don't worry I'm here (I'm here)
I don't care if you're looking for the next girl of the year
Girl of the year
I'm here
I'm here
Girl of the year
I'm here
I'm here

Somebody gonna take my place
Somebody gonna take first place
You gotta keep the system going, going
Somebody gonna take my place
Somebody gonna take first place
You gotta keep the system going, going

There's a hollow inside you
And it won't disappear
Oh no, baby don't worry I'll be girl of all the year
There's a hollow inside you
But don't worry I'm here
I don't care if you're looking for the next one of the year
Girl of the year

If you see me coming
Pretend that I'm the only one
I like your lies
(I'm here, girl of the year)
If you see me coming
You better show me your love
I like your lies
(I'm here, girl of the year)
If you see me coming
Pretend that I'm the only one
I like your lies
(I'm here, girl of the year)
If you see me coming
You better show me your love
I like your lies
(I'm here, girl of the year)

I'm here
I'm here, girl of the year
I'm here
Girl of the year
I'm here
I'm here, girl of the year
I'm here
I'm here
