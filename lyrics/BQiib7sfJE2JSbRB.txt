Tomorrow you're gone
I'm moving on
Let's make a night to remember
Your smile and that kiss
Those things I will miss
A passion that I'm gonna treasure

Love don't let go,
Break of dawn you'll be gone

Just give me one more night, you and I
Forget 'bout tomorrow and dance through the night
One more night, you and I
Let's make it feel like forever
All I want is one more night
One more night
All I want is one more night
I wanna get some love tonight

Let's not analyze
What's wrong or what's right
Some things are best left unspoken
The glow in your eyes
My lips are on fire
Don't care if my heart will be broken

Love don't let go,
Break of dawn you'll be gone

Just give me one more night, you and I
Forget 'bout tomorrow and dance through the night
One more night, you and I
Let's make it feel like forever
All I want is one more night
One more night
All I want is one more night
I wanna get some love tonight

The night is young but don't waste your time
I want the full experience blow my mind
Let emotions flow don't stop be alive
I wanna drown in your arms every second of the night

You and me till the break of dawn
Hold on to the moment like it'll never be gone

Push the limit love on top
One more night that is all we got

Just give me one more night, you and I
Forget 'bout tomorrow and dance through the night
One more night, you and I let's make it feel like forever
All I want is one more night
One more night
All I want is one more night
I wanna get some love tonight
