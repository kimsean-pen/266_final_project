Now let it lift you, oh

One love will, one love will
One love can take you make you feel alive and whole

Why give it up? Why tear it up?

One love will, my love will
My love will make you feel alive enough to let go

Oh, the death row
Once again you feel like the brothers know
Once again, back is the incredible
The rhyme animal, the unforgettable D

Public enemy number one
Five-oh said, "Freeze" and I got numb
Can't I tell 'em that I really never had a gun
But the wax that the terminator X spun now

So soft, so alive
My dear, so good
So close, so real

This love
Woah love, wanna give it up
Let's turn it loose

Bond, James Bond
