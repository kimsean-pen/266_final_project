You look like a praying mantis
You could say that the bug is man
Big joke or a small disaster
Last chance before they give it the plaster

Paint my picture and I'll paint you
You're not like others you ain't
Running down the hill I thought I passed her
Last chance before they give it the plaster

I can't dance but I don't wanna bore ya
Last line from the cephalaphore
I'll be the son of a son of a son of a bastard
Last chance before they give it the plaster
Big joke or a small disaster
Last chance before they give it the plaster
