She's your cocaine
She's got you shaving your legs
You can suck anything
But you know
You wanna be me, said
Put on your makeup, boy, you're your favourite stranger
And we all like to watch
So shimmy once

And do it again

Bring your sister!
Bring your sister if you can't handle it!

Bring your sister!
Bring your sister if you can't handle it!

She says you control it
Then she says you don't control it
Then she says you're controlling
The way she makes you crawl, yes!
She's your cocaine

Your exodus laughing
And she knows what you are
So shimmy once
And do it again

Bring your sister!
Bring your sister if you can't handle it!
Bring your sister!

Bring your sister if you can't handle it!
Mmm!
If you want me to, boy, I could lie to you
You don't need one of these to let me inside of you

And is it true
That devils end up like you Something safe
For the picture frame
And is it true
That devils end up like you
So tied up
You don't know how
She came I said
She's your cocaine
She's got you shaving your legs
I got she liking mine back
Got me taking it in
Getting mine back

Lasting mine evil
I'm taking my easel
And I'm writing good checks
You sign Prince Of Darkness, try
Squire Of Dimness
Please don't help me with this!
Please don't help me with this!
Please don't help me with this!
No!
Ah ah ah ah ah... ah!
Cut it again!
