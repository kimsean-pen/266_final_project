All this ice leave me blinded
Five star life, stay reminded
Bitch, I done grinded
I pull up with designer, if you with it lean behind it
All these lights leave you blinded
Five star life, stay reminded
Bitch, I done grinded
I pull up with designer, if you with it lean behind it

Bitch, I'm cruisin' down the black lodge with a black wrist watch
Got a bad bitch sippin' scotch, poppin' Tic Tacs
Pull up with a black car, gotta hit the snack bar
Mitsubishi cruisin' down the lanes like its NASCAR
They say I'm too bizarre, but I done make it this far
Might smoke a fat jetpack out to Myanmar
I'm feelin' like a movie star
Countin' stacks with my boys in a sushi bar
Uh, no, you won't get this far
Bitch, I bet you know who we are
Wake up and I see dark
Never let the dogs bark, leave you lookin' like a question mark
I be stuntin' overseas, all my boys ride for Lean
Bands to the ceilin', smoke away all my feelings
I be, I be gettin' rich, bitch
I just came to say
Left an addict, I guess I meant that I'm an addict
You can't spit, my money standin', lookin' like cabbage
Hashish, steady takin' trips, livin' lavish, oh

All this ice leave me blinded
Five star life, stay reminded
Bitch, I done grinded
I pull up with designer, if you with it lean behind it
All these lights leave you blinded
Five star life, stay reminded
Bitch, I done grinded
I pull up with designer, if you with it lean behind it

All this ice leave me blinded
Five star life, stay reminded
Bitch, I done grinded
I pull up with designer, if you with it lean behind it
All these lights leave you blinded
Five star life, stay reminded
Bitch, I done grinded
I pull up with designer, if you with it lean behind it

Bitch, I-
