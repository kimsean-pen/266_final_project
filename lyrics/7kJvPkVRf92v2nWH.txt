If you urge for transcendance
You will have to feel
All the pain getting there
As your fate will be sealed
If you wish for a solace
A journey's end
You will have to suffer before you can depend

Seldom you will find
Your mission inside
You falter
A wish to die
There are no goodbyes

Is it the same?
A place where the truth is contained
Where you're always left with the blame
Now you know how I've fought to erase
All the thoughts that never moved on
When we're all depending on the same revolution
