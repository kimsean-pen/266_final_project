Waiting for a girl like you

The light shines
It's getting hot on my shoulders
I don't mind
This time it doesn't matter
'Cause your friends
They look good but you look better

Don't you know all night?
I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around, round, round

Under the lights tonight, you turned around
And you stole my heart with just one look
When I saw your face, I fell in love
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight (eh, eh, eh, eh)
With just one look, yeah (eh, eh, eh, eh)
Been waiting for a girl like you

I'm weaker
My words fall and they hit the ground
Oh, life
Come on here, don't you fail me now?
I start to say
"I think I love you," but I make no sound

You know, 'cause all my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around

Under the lights tonight, you turned around
And you stole my heart with just one look
When I saw your face, I fell in love
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight (eh, eh, eh, eh)
With just one look, yeah (eh, eh, eh, eh)
Been waiting for a girl like you

There is no other place that I would rather be
Than right here with you tonight
As we lay on the ground I put my arms around you
And we can stay here tonight
'Cause there's so much that I wanna say, I wanna say

Under the lights tonight, you turned around
And you stole my heart with just one look
When I saw your face, I fell in love
It took a minute girl to steal my heart
Under the lights tonight (eh, eh, eh), you turned around
And you stole my heart (eh, eh, eh), with just one look
When I saw your face (eh, eh, eh), I fell in love
It took a minute girl (eh, eh, eh) to steal my heart tonight (eh, eh, eh, eh)
With just one look, yeah (eh, eh, eh, eh)
Been waiting for a girl like you
