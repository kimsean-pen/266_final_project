Oh yeah...
Woah...
Mhm...
C'mon...

Nobody can sing like me
I can hit every note you give for me
From A to Z
Yes I can

Nobody can dance like me
I can move to the beat your playin'
Baby with my feet
Yeah yeah.

Nobody can act like me
I can fall to pieces and make you believe almost anything

I'm the one
Steppin' out and we're ready
You know the rules
All alone (all alone)
Gonna show everybody what I can do
I'm the one
Put your bet on me
Can't you see that
I'm the one
Don't need anybody now
Makin' it on my own

She can turn every word
into a lovely melody
Yes she can

Girl's got her own groove
Put the music on
And watch her as she
Does her thing
She can do anything

My girl is a drama queen
Any role you give her
She does perfectly
Oh, can't you see that

She's the one
She's steppin' out and we're ready
You know the rules
All alone
She gonna show everybody what she can do
She's the one
Put you bet on her
Can't you see that
She's the one
She don't need anybody now
And she's makin' it on her own

I wanna be
The one who everybody knows
(I'm steppin out, steppin out alright)
I wanna be
The one who's always front and center
For the first time in my life

I'm the one
Steppin' out and we're ready
You know the rules
All alone (all alone)
Gonna show everybody what I can do
I'm the one
Put your bet on me
Can't you see that
I'm the one
Don't need anybody now
Makin' it on my own

I'm the one
Steppin' out and we're ready
You know the rules
All alone (all alone)
Gonna show everybody what I can do
I'm the one
Put your bet on me
Can't you see that
I'm the one
Don't need anybody now
Makin' it on my own

I'm the one
