We're playin' those mind games together
Pushin' the barriers, plantin' seeds
Playin' the mind guerrilla
Chantin' the mantra, peace on earth

We all been playin' those mind games forever
Some kinda druid dude liftin' the veil
Doin' the mind guerrilla
Some call it magic, the search for the grail

Love is the answer
And you know that for sure
Love is a flower
You gotta let it, you gotta let it grow

So keep on playin' those mind games together
Faith in the future, outta the now
You just can't beat on those mind guerrillas
Absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind

Yeah, we're playin' those mind games forever
Projectin' our images in space and in time

Yes is the answer
And you know that for sure
Yes is surrender
You gotta let it, you gotta let it go

So keep on playin' those mind games together
Doin' the ritual dance in the sun
Millions of mind guerrillas
Puttin' their soul power to the karmic wheel
Keep on playin' those mind games forever
Raisin' the spirit of peace and love
Love
I want you to make love, not war
I know you've heard it before
