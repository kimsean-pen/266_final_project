It's seven in the morning why you calling
You say that you just wanna hear my voice
Am I supposed to pick up or be honest
'Cause you've been leaving me without a choice

My mind's been made up and I don't wanna give in
We said it was done so why are we still here

Yeah, I'm begging you to stay
Leave your car keys on the table
And just dance with me instead
Didn't think it'd be so painful
Watching you walk out the door
When all of me wants to hate you
'Cause I know that I could love you more

Telling all your friends that you don't want me
Leaving with somebody you just met
Going out all week like you forget me
While I'm sleeping with your hands around my neck

My mind's been made up and I don't wanna give in
We said it was done so why are we still here

Yeah, i'm begging you to stay
Leave your car keys on the table
And just dance with me instead
Didn't think it'd be so painful
Watching you walk out the door
When all of me wants to hate you
'Cause I know that I could love you more

Sleeping on my own
While my thoughts will try to drown me
Before I can reach the phone
Call you and ask you how'd we
Get so far away from home
Didn't think it'd hurt without you
But I know that I could love you more

It's seven in the morning why you calling?
You say that you just wanna hear my voice

Yeah, I'm begging you to stay
Leave your car keys on the table
And just dance with me instead
Didn't think it'd be so painful
Watching you walk out the door
When all of me wants to hate you
'Cause I know that I could love you more

Sleeping on my own
While my thoughts will try to drown me
Before I can reach the phone
Call you and ask you how'd we
Get so far away from home
Didn't think it'd hurt without you
But I know that I could love you more
