Could've given you everything that you need
...
But I cannot turn back the years
The perfect love was all you wanted from me

...
But I cannot turn back the years
So we have to be strong, and I'm finding that hard
...
We have to move on, no matter how hard I try

...
If your heart's in pieces, you look for the truth
And when I look deep down inside I know
...

It's too bad I love you, too bad I love
...
Sometimes hits me in the morning, hits me at night
...
That I cannot turn back the years

...
So I look out my window, turn off my light
...
But I cannot turn back the years
...

Can't make it seem easy, when you're all that I see
...
Can't live in a dream and I won't serenade the truth
...

People are hurting and they're looking to me
And I look at you there's nothing more to say
...
It's too bad I love you
But I'm never gonna give it up

You know I love you
And I'm never gonna give it up
I'll keep holding on to you
And I'm never gonna give it up, give it up
...
All that I lived for, all that I dreamed
...
But I cannot turn back the years
You're the water I drink, you're the air that I breathe
...
But I cannot turn back the years
...
So we have to be strong, and I'm finding that hard
...
We have to move on, but no matter how hard I try
...
If your heart's in pieces, you look for the truth
And when I look deep down inside I know
...
It's too bad I love you
But I'm never gonna give it up
No, no, no, never gonna
It's here to stay and I'm never gonna
...
Never gonna give it up
Never gonna, no never gonna give it up
...
Never gonna give it up, no I'm never gonna give it up
...
You know, you mean too much to me to give it up
...
Never gonna give it up
...
