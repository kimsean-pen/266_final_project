There was a little boy
Too different to belong
Too lonely to be strong
(on fire, on fire, oh)
Laying on the ground
He said that fallin' down
It wouldn't make a sound
So now I'm gonna show you
'Til the end of time
'Til the end of time
Yeah, now you're gonna know, yeah
Why I'm gonna shine

I'm burnin', I'm on fire
Here I am, inside your flames
I don't care anymore
Don't need your oxygen
Here I am, taming the flames
Not afraid anymore
Strong like a warrior

Even I hit the dust
I'm gonna
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', –in'
Even I hit the dust
I'm gonna
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', –in' –in'

There was a little girl
From a broken family
With a silent fantasy
Her head was in the sky
Heart was made of stars
Her skin was made of scars

So now I'm gonna show you
'Til the end of time
'Til the end of time
Yeah, now you're gonna know, yeah
Why I'm gonna shine

I'm burnin', I'm on fire
Here I am, inside your flames
I don't care anymore
Don't need your oxygen
Here I am, taming the flames
Not afraid anymore
Strong like a warrior

Even I hit the dust
I'm gonna
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', –in'
Even I hit the dust
I'm gonna
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin'

Oh, I'm burning, I'm on fire
Oh, I'm burning
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh

I'm burnin', I'm on fire
Here I am, inside your flames
I don't care anymore
Don't need your oxygen
Here I am, taming the flames
Not afraid anymore
Strong like a warrior

Even I hit the dust
I'm gonna
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', –in'
Even I hit the dust
I'm gonna
And light up like a flare

I'm burnin', I'm on fire
Here I am, inside your flames
I don't care anymore
Don't need your oxygen
Here I am, taming the flames
Not afraid anymore
Strong like a warrior

Even I hit the dust
I'm gonna
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', –in'
Even I hit the dust
I'm gonna
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', –in' –in'
