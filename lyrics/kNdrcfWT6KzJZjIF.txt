You could be my better half
If you could be the first one wouldn't it become a nice chase
When the dark knocks down would you leverage what your mind says
If your bears lost now would you turn back time to trace him
This could change a lot for the both of us

I'll take you with a few puff, yes
I'll take you when the lights are low
Come meet me half way post to post
Just like when
Just like when we love real slow

Let's have a look
Find the key plays to keep
Where we off to
Where you wanna go from here
Off to ever everland
Or just stay in the palm of your hands
Where we off to
Where you wanna go from here

Put me in a box
Where I'm suppose to be when I've got a crave for us
Does this mean the time apart well never depended on us
You could be my better half if you learn to love what your mind says
This could change a lot for the both of us

I'll take you with a few puff, yes
I'll take you when the lights are low
Come meet me half way post to post
Just like when
Just like when we love real slow

Let's have a look
Find the key plays to keep
Where we off to
Where you wanna go from here
Off to ever everland
Or just stay in the palm of your hands
Where we off to
Where you wanna go from here
