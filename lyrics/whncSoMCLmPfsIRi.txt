You say, you want it all
But with the demons in your head
You can't see straight
But give me, a chance to be the light
To guide you through, and be your eyes

The darkness in your soul always a part of you
I'll be by your side, just follow me, follow me

Follow me, don't be afraid
I will lead you to a better place
Free from the sorrows
Away from the let downs
You will find a home

I never thought it would come to this
What are you waiting for?
I forgave myself for my mistakes
Why are you holding on?

From ashes you will rise
I'll walk a thousand miles
You know I never give up
Just follow me, follow me

Follow me, don't be afraid
I will lead you to a better place
Free from the sorrows
Away from the let downs
You will find a home

I never thought it would come to this

Follow me, don't be afraid (Don't be afraid)
I will lead you to a better place
Free from the sorrows
Away from the let downs
You will find a home

Follow me, don't be afraid (Don't be afraid)
I will lead you to a better place
Free from the sorrows
Away from the let downs
You will find a home
