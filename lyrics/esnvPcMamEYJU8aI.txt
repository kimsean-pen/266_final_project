{ (Say, say)
Say, where did I see this guy?
(Say, say, say, say)
In Red River?
Or a place in the sun?
Maybe a misfit
From here to eternity}

Everybody say, "Is he all right?"
An' everybody say, "What's he like?"
An' everybody say, "He sure looks funny"
That Montgomery Clift, honey!

(New York, New York)
New York, New York, 42nd Street
Hustlers rustle and pimp pimp the beat
Monty Clift is recognized at dawn
He ain't got no shoes, his clothes are torn

An' everybody say, "Is he all right?"
An' everybody say, "What's he like?"
Everybody say, "He sure looks funny"
That's the Montgomery Clift, honey!

I see a car smashed at night
Cut the applause and dim the light
Monty's face is broken on a wheel
Is he alive?
Can he still feel?

An' everybody say, "Is he all right?"
Everybody say, "Shine a light"
Everybody say, "He's not fine"
That's Montgomery Clift, honey!

Seems as the right profile

An' everybody say, "Is he all right?"
Everybody say, "What's he like?"
Everybody say, "He sure looks funny"
That's Montgomery Clift, honey!

Nembutal, numbs it all
But I prefer
Alcohol
(Uhh, uhh)

An' everybody say, "What's he like?"
An' everybody say, "Is he all right?"
Everybody say, "He sure looks funny"
That's Montgomery Clift, honey!

He said, "Go out, get me my old movie stills
Go out 'n' get me another roll of pills"
There I go shaking, but I ain't got the chills
Argh buh buh argh!

An' everybody say, "What's he like?"
Everybody say, "Is he all right?"
Everybody say, "He sure looks funny"
I must touch Montgomery Clift, honey!
