Her soul will be a swan
Until
She feels
The love of nobleman
Forever her soul will be a swan
Until
She feels
The love of noble...

In swan lake
In swan lake
In swan lake
In swan lake

Tired to ride in the royal hunt
To listen sweet lies that I am wont
I am the prince! The future king!
Boomed in my head my mother's voice
Take to wife should be my choice
Oh, cruel fate! That my soul hate!

To forget all I fled into the woods
Searching preys goods
Then I saw the lake lost in the deep forest
And its water chorused an odd melody

Swans of nice white feather on the dusk
Swam in a dance in harmonious masque
Hunter I am! My bow was prepared

But her beauty was shown me in the depth
Spouting, silent, from the lake
And her pale look kept a sad poem
Lost in despair
Dragged into the warlock's lair

In the shadows
Her soul will be a swan
Until
She feels
The love of nobleman
Forever her soul will be a swan
Until
She feels
The love of noble...

Like a night tide
Together we cried
Our lips sealed its secrets way
And my doubts died
But when came the dawn
My dream sank covered by dark waters

But her beauty was shown me in the depth
Spouting, silent, from the lake
And her pale look kept a sad poem
Lost in despair
Dragged into the warlock's lair

In the shadows
Her soul will be a swan
Until
She feels
The love of nobleman
Forever her soul will be a swan
Until
She feels
The love of nobleman

My princess's tears fall in the moonglade
The lake is afraid
The night shows the spell
Then I can feel my heart run into my chest
Now I know my quest

In the hell of the storm
I'll break her swan-form
So inside the waves
We will find our graves
But the warlock's curse will be broken

But her beauty was shown me in the depth
Spouting, silent, from the lake
And her pale look kept a sad poem
Lost in despair
Dragged into the warlock's lair

In the shadows
Her soul will be a swan
Until
She feels
The love of nobleman
Forever her soul will be a swan
Until
She feels
The love of nobleman

My princess's tears fall in the moonglade
The lake is afraid
The night shows the spell
Then I can feel my heart run into my chest
Now I know my quest

In the hell of the storm
I'll break her swan-form
So inside the waves
We will find our graves
But the warlock's curse will be broken
The Rothboart's curse will be broken

The Rothboart's curse broken
The Rothboart's curse broken
The Rothboart's curse broken
The Rothboart's curse broken

Our spirits will be free
Will fly the sky
Over the green lake's trees
Forever our spirits will be free
Will fly the sky
Over the green lake's trees

Remember us in the stars
Remember us in the stars
