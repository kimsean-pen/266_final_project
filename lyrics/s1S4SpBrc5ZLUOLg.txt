Wandering out into the sea of streetlights
Calling up everyone I know
Trying our best to keep our monsters inside
Nobody wants to be alone

But tonight, we're all believers
And I feel all right, with all of my heart
Oh tonight, we're all believers
And I'll be all right, as long as you are

Running our hands over the stone and pavement
Giving up all the fights and complications
Nobody tells you that the city's different
Nobody wants to be alone

But tonight, we're all believers
And I feel all right, with all of my heart
Oh tonight, we're all believers
And I'll be all right, as long as you are

How could you say that I was too in love to remember myself?
How could you say I left you waiting up on the shelf?
The colors are dangerous, they shine so bright, thunder and lightning
How could you say this was a home?

But tonight, we're all believers
And I feel all right, with all of my heart
Oh tonight, we're all believers
And I'll be all right, as long as you are

Tonight, we're all believers
And I feel all right, with all of my heart
Oh tonight, we're all believers
And I'll be all right, as long as you are
