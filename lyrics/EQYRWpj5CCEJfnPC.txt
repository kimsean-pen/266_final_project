Ooh, when I get you inside it
I'll rock you all night 'til the sun comes up
Say you don't like it when I get this drunk
We can do anything you like, we can be wild
Wild

I was just doing my thing, saw you walk in with the gang
Got a new girl and she fake
You know I don't mean to hate, but you could do better with me
Hey, I saw you staring at me from the bar
You let me take a hit off of your blunt
Blurry, my vision, then we were kissing
I must admit that I'm having a ball, yeah

I drank enough and you spanked it up
But no need to be polite
I must be faded, need no persuading
Let's make the good night
I drank enough and you spanked it up
But no need to be polite
I must be faded, need no persuading

Ooh, when I get you inside it
I'll rock you all night 'til the sun comes up
Say you don't like it when I get this drunk
We can do anything you like, we can be wild
Wild

We can start out on the bed or move it on to the couch
Normally wouldn't allow putting your hands in my mouth
But I took so many down
Now, tell me you've done this with nobody else
Tell all your friends to go home and be well
We gon' be going, 4 in the morning
Or maybe longer, I'm feeling myself, yeah

I drank enough and you spanked it up
But no need to be polite
I must be faded, need no persuading
Let's make the good night
I drank enough and you spanked it up
But no need to be polite
I must be faded, need no persuading

Ooh, when I get you inside it
I'll rock you all night 'til the sun comes up
Say you don't like it when I get this drunk
We can do anything you like, we can be wild
Wild

I may be young, but I know enough to get wild
If it feels like a drug, am I in love or just wild?
I may be young, but I know enough to get wild
If it feels like a drug, am I in love or just wild?
Am I just wild?
Tell me I'm, tell me I'm, tell me I'm, tell me I'm wild
Am I just, am I just, am I just, am I just wild?
Tell me I'm, tell me I'm wild, tell me I'm wild

Ooh, when I get you inside it
I'll rock you all night 'til the sun comes up
Say you don't like it when I get this drunk
We can do anything you like, we can be wild
Ooh, when I get you inside
I'll rock you all night 'til the sun comes up
Say you don't like it when I get this drunk
We can do anything you like, we can be wild
