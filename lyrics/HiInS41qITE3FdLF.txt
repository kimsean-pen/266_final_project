What would it take
For things to be quiet
Quiet like the snow
And I know this isn't much
But I know I could, I could be better
I don't think I deserve it
Selflessness
Find your way
Into my heart
All stars could be brighter
All hearts could be warmer
What would it take
For things to be quiet
Quiet like the snow
Are we meant to be empty-handed
I know I could, I could be better
I don't think I deserve it
Selflessness
Find your way
Into my heart
All stars could be brighter
All hearts could be warmer
(what would it take)
(for things to be quiet)
(what would it take)
(for things to be quiet)
What would it take
For things to be quiet
