Do not sleep, my starling
Sleep, my doe
She is wrapped in curtains
Laid in snow
She will bury you inside her fur

Do not sleep
She waits for you to sleep
Do not sleep
She waits for you to sleep

My breath you breathe
It will carry you
My breath you breathe
It carries you

Do not sleep
She waits for you to sleep
Do not sleep, my starling
Do not sleep
