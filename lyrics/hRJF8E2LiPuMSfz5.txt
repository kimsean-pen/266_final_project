Scarce progress from complacence in your way
Well, you'll find that sterile thoughts are brought
By notions of self imposed grandeur

But, arm the suffix
Well, rebuke the stoic
I, rescind composure
Sound set, stand off
Well, weapon logic
I, rebuke the stoic
They, rescind composure
Sound set, stand off
Sound set, stand off

Stop, rip the line

Praise something and again save yourself some breath
Sermon stalemate, condemn and don't resuscitate
Idle thoughts of the great, sly like bright snide snakes
Praise something and again, save your love of a friend

Say it, breath out and irate souls spring
To their life worth tapestry
Resent, lie, just stay loud
And I'll bray solace lies
