I never had a chance to say
What I needed to say
Cause when you took your last breath
I was high, I was running away
You'd always call me on the phone, but I never pick up
I never wanted you to know, I was running out of love
You didn't walk out, you didn't give up on me
So even if you're coming, I'm not giving up on you

We never have to say goodbye
Cause I can feel you from the afterlife
And I just wanna say, that every single day
You make me take a deeper look inside
If everything you say its true
Then I would never have to call on you
In every single way
You're with me every day
So we never have to say
We never have to say goodbye

We never have to say
We never have to say goodbye

I didn't have the strength
That I needed at the end of the day
Cause I was popping every pill
The only one that I was fooling was me
You always love me, when I couldn't even love myself
You never turned away, when I was begging for help
Should have said thanks, you're never giving up on me
So even if you're coming, I'm not giving up on you

We never have to say goodbye
Cause I can feel you from the afterlife
And I just wanna say, that every single day
You make me take a deeper look inside
If everything you say its true
Then I would never have to call on you
In every single way
You're with me every day
So we never have to say
We never have to say goodbye

We never have to say
We never have to say goodbye

I can hear your voice, when I walk through the pain
Showed me how to live, showed me that I could change
I can feel you catch me when I fall away

We never have to say goodbye
Cause I can feel you from the afterlife
And I just wanna say, that every single day
You make me take a deeper look inside
If everything you say its true
Then I would never have to call on you
In every single way
You're with me every day
So we never have to say
We never have to say goodbye

We never have to say
We never have to say goodbye
We never have to say
We never have to say goodbye
