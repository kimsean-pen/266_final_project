C'mon, c'mon!
C'mon, c'mon!

On those Saturdays when kids go out and play
Yo, I was up in my room, I let the stereo blaze.
Wasn't faded, not jaded, just a kid
With a pad and a pen and a big imagination.
All this, I seek, I find
I push the envelope to the line.
Make it, break it, take it
Until I'm overrated!

Click, click, boom!
I'm coming down on the stereo, hear me on the radio
Click, click, boom!
I'm coming down with the new style and you know it's buck wild
Click, click, boom!
I'm on the radio station, touring 'round the nation
Leaving the scene in devastation.

I can see it in my mind
I can see it in their eyes
It's close enough to touch it now
But far away enough to die!

What the hell is wrong with me?
My mom and dad weren't perfect
But still you don't hear no cryin' ass bitchin' from me
Like there seems to be on everybody's CD.
So just sit back and relax
And let me have your head for a minute
I can show you something in it that has yet to be presented!
Oh yeah!

Click, click, boom!
I'm coming down on the stereo, hear me on the radio
Click, click, boom!
I'm coming down with the new style and you know it's buck wild
Click, click, boom!
I'm on the radio station, touring 'round the nation
Leaving the scene in devastation.

Why have I clouded up my mind
Why's my mother always right?
And will I make it 'till the end
Or will I crawl away and die?
Click, click, boom!
Click, click, boom!
Click, click, boom!

Click, click, boom...
On those Saturdays when kids go out and play
Yo I was up in my room, I let the stereo blaze.
On Saturdays when kids go out and play
I was up in my room, I let the stereo blaze!

It's all inside of me, it's all inside of me
It's all inside of me, it's all inside of my head!
It's all inside of me, it's coming over me
It's all inside of me, it's all inside my head!
Yeah!

Click, click, boom!
I'm coming down on the stereo, hear me on the radio
Click, click, boom!
I'm coming down with the new style and you know it's buck wild
Everybody, Everybody come on! (come on, come on)
Everybody come on! (come on, come on)
Click, click, boom! (come on, come on)
Everybody come on! (come on, come on)
Click, click, boom! (come on, come on)
Everybody come on! (come on, come on)
Click, click, boom! (come on, come on)
Everybody come on! (come on, come on)
Click, click, boom!
