The well is dry and the stream runs shallow
And the sun is high and the field lies fallow
My tongue is tied and my body aching
Now I'm open wide and afraid of breaking

The food is hot and the table's ready
But my stomach's knots make my hands
Unsteady
So I take to pacing up and down the room
While my heart keeps racing and my mind's
Consumed

I just want to be part of the light of the light of
The light of the light of the light in your eyes
I just want to be part of the light of the light of
The light of the light of the light in your eyes

The bed is made and the candles burning
All our games are played and the clock keeps
Turning
We're out of tricks with the silence cutting
And the daggers stick as the doors keep
Shutting

I just want to be part of the fight of the fight of
The fight of the fight of the fight in your eyes
I just want to be part of the fight of the fight of
The fight of the fight of the fight in your eyes

Always

Always, forever
