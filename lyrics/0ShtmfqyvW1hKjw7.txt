lighting across the sky
beauty that paralyzes, oh i, oh i
i'm not scared, i wanna try
you're a storm, i can't deny, oh i, oh i

my baby gone, he got me so high
is heaven's door right next door to my heart
don't even know what the diﬀerence is
don't even know what the diﬀerence is
my baby told me that i'm in love
but no, i'm tripping tripping, did he slip me a drug?
don't even know what the diﬀerence is
can't even tell you what the diﬀerence is

just know i feel that rain, it's coming towards you
just know i feel that rain, it's coming towards you
feel that rain, it's coming towards you
feel that rain, it's coming towards you

watch it electrify
blazes across the sky, oh i, oh i

my baby gone, he got me so high
is heaven's door right next door to my heart
don't even know what the diﬀerence is
don't even know what the diﬀerence is
my baby told me that i'm in love
but no, i'm tripping tripping, did he slip me a drug?
don't even know what the diﬀerence is
can't even tell you what the diﬀerence is

just know i feel that rain, it's coming towards you
just know i feel that rain, it's coming towards you
feel that rain, it's coming towards you
feel that rain, it's coming towards you

feel that rain, it's coming towards you
feel that rain, it's coming towards you
feel that rain, it's coming towards you
feel that rain, it's coming towards you
