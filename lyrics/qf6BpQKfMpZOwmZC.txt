Rudy's on the midway
And Jacob's in the hole
The monkey's on the ladder
The devil shovels coal
With crows as big as airplanes
The lion has three heads
And someone will eat the skin that he sheds
And the earth died screaming while I lay dreaming.
Well the earth died screaming while I lay dreaming.
Dreaming of you
Well hell doesn't want you
And heaven is full
Bring me some water
Put it in this skull
I walk between the raindrops
Wait in bug house square
And the army ants
They leave nothin' but the bones
And the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming.
Well the earth died screaming while I lay dreaming
Well the earth died screaming while I lay dreaming.
Dreaming of you
There was thunder
There was lightning
Then the stars went out
And the moon fell from the sky
It rained mackerel
It rained trout
And the great day of wrath has come
And here's mud in your big red eye
The poker's in the fire
And the locusts take the sky
And the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming and the earth died screaming while I lay dreaming,
Well the earth died screaming while I lay dreaming
Dreaming of you
While dreaming of you
While dreaming of you ooo dreaming of you.
