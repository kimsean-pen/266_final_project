Alright crew, it's weekend

Flat on your back like one, two, three

'Pon the mic I'm the teacher
Spread my words like a preacher
Cut the crap, Get a slap
Drum'n'Bass's still on the map
Drum'n'Bass's still on the map

This one goes out to everybody in the place

Flat on your back like one, two, three

'Pon the mic I'm the Voodoo
The destination is Zulu
Cut the crap, Get a slap
Drum'n'Bass's still on the map
Drum'n'Bass's still on the map

This one goes out to everybody in the place

Love in a woman's heart
I wanna have the whole and not a part
Strange that this feeling grows more and more
'Cause I've never loved someone like you before

Go ahead

Love in a woman's heart
I wanna have the whole and not a part
Strange that this feeling grows more and more
'Cause I've never loved someone like you before

Go ahead

Respect to the man in the ice cream van
Respect to the man in the ice cream van
Respect to the man in the ice cream van

Here comes the chicks terminator
Here we come, in control, here we go

Respect to the man in the ice cream van
Respect to the man in the ice cream van
Respect to the man in the ice cream van

Here comes the chicks terminator
Here we come, in control, here we go

Love in a woman's heart
I wanna have the whole and not a part
Strange that this feeling grows more and more
'Cause I've never loved someone like you before

Go ahead

Love in a woman's heart
I wanna have the whole and not a part
Strange that this feeling grows more and more
'Cause I've never loved someone like you before

Go ahead

Sounds of a track attack
Sounds of a track attack
Sounds of a track attack

Over and out
