I need to push it back, push it back again

I was lost in the ocean
I never knew that I could swim this far
I was lost in devotion
I never thought that I would fall for this but I gave away my heart
(But I gave away my heart)

In these darkened days I've got nothing left to hold on
But the morning rays are telling me to stay strong (They are telling me)

How did I get myself into this wreck?
I never thought I'd push myself this far, so I keep asking
How did I loose myself and how do I live on like this?
I need to push it back, push it back again

I need to push it back again
I need to push it back

Maybe I look like I am fine
But take a look and you will see that I lost my spine
I feel so numb
I don't wanna be the person that I've become

In these darkened days I've got nothing left to hold on
But the morning rays are telling me to stay strong

How did I get myself into this wreck?
I never thought I'd push myself this far, so I keep asking
How did I loose myself and how do I live on like this?
I need to push it back, push it back again

Even when I find myself in these darkened days
I leave these scars behind before my mind decays

(Even when I find myself in these darkened days)
(I leave these scars behind before my mind decays)

(Even when I find myself in these darkened days)
(I leave these scars behind before my mind decays)

How did I get myself into this wreck?

How did I get myself into this wreck?
I never thought I'd push myself this far, so I keep asking
How did I loose myself and how do I live on like this?
I need to push it back, push it back again
