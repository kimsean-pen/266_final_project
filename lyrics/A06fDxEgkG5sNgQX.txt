Have you seen what I saw
The sky came down from afar
Have you been there before
That place where hearts reborn

I'm looking for a place to go
I'm waiting on another hiding place for hearts
Hiding place for hearts

I'm looking for a safety zone
I'm waiting on another hiding place for hearts
Hiding place for hearts

Have you dreamed of a world
Where armor shields your bones
Have you ransomed your soul
To pay for all that you've got wrong

I'm looking for a place to go
I'm waiting on another hiding place for hearts
Hiding place for hearts

I'm looking for a safety zone
I'm waiting on another hiding place for hearts
Hiding place for hearts

Never give up
Never give up
Never give up
Never give up

I'm looking for a place to go
I'm waiting on another hiding place for hearts
Hiding place for hearts

I'm looking for a safety zone
I'm waiting on another hiding place for hearts
Hiding place for hearts

Never give up
Never give up
Never give up
Never give up
