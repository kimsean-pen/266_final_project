Slicing jaws, a way of life
Brought up to waste mankind
Loki's pets his little children
Deadly every time

Trapped in swamps by gates of Hell
Don't ever let them out
For if you do and they escape
You'll fight a bloody bout

Piranha kill in a pack, you'll run
Piranha start to attack, you'll done
If you think you can beat, deadly school
If you think you can live, you're a fool

Gates of Hell are old and cracked
They tumble and they fall
Out rush, a bloody wall of death
To kill anything at all

Their sole mission is to kill
Strip your bones and flesh
Rip out your eyes, tear off your face
An agonizing death

Piranha kill in a pack, you'll run
Piranha start to attack, you'll done
If you think you can beat, deadly school
If you think you can live, you're a fool
