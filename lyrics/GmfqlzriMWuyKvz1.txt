Tuesday afternoon
I'm just beginning to see
Now I'm on my way
It doesn't matter to me
Chasing the clouds away

Something calls to me
The trees are drawing me near
I've got to find out why
Those gentle voices I hear
Explain it all with a sigh

I'm looking at myself, reflections of my mind
It's just the kind of day to leave myself behind
So gently swaying through the fairy-land of love
If you'll just come with me and see the beauty of
Tuesday afternoon
Tuesday afternoon

Tuesday afternoon
I'm just beginning to see
Now I'm on my way
It doesn't matter to me
Chasing the clouds away

Something calls to me
The trees are drawing me near
I've got to find out why
Those gentle voices I hear
Explain it all with a sigh

Evening has come to pass
The time of day doesn't last
Evening has earned its place today
I'm tired of working away

Working, living, it brings
Only way to have those things
Toiling has bought too many tears
Turn round all those past years

Evening, time to get away
Evening, time to get away
Evening, time to get away
Till next day

Live, all you people
You can see where you're at
It doesn't really hurt you
So that can't be bad

Live, all you people
You can see where you're at
It doesn't really hurt you
So that can't be bad

Evening, time to get away
Evening, time to get away
