They keep asking how we got to this place
I can answer that with a question
Let me ask you how you lost your faith
Ask your god why he withholds his blessings
I see them falling in the gap between the wage
I see them falling and there's no-one catching
We're chasing dollars with slaveowners on the face
Those are the dollars that we're never gonna make
(Yo!)

Sell me out down the shallow river
Could I hate you more?
Could I hate you more?
Sell me out down the shallow river
Could I hate you more?
Could I hate you more?

Sold me out, sold me out
You sold me out to the highest bidder
Sold me out, sold me out
You sold me out to the highest bidder

You're missing every single shot you don't take
So fill your quota with these moving targets
They push you then tell you stay in your place
Eyes on the profit, don't you miss the market
You say you're hungry with a mountain on your plate
You say you're hungry while the world is starving
We're chasing dollars with slaveowners on the face
They crack the whip and hope our backs don't break
(Yo!)

Sell me out down the shallow river
Could I hate you more?
Could I hate you more?
Sell me out down the shallow river
Could I hate you more?
Could I hate you more?

Sold me out, sold me out
You sold me out to the highest bidder
Sold me out, sold me out
You sold me out to the highest bidder

Press on a pedal behind a fucking desk
You slaves
