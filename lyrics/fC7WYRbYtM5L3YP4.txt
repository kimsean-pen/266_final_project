Winning's not everything, but how would i know
I'm just an underdog, with words i cant show
First to come last, no one knows my name
Ashes to ashes, it's time for a change

I've been thinking it over, I've been taking my time
Every scenario, runs through my mind
But against all the odds, the tables will turn
Our hearts are on fire, so just let them burn

When im close to the edge, fly high like an eagle
You keep holding me back, but there's fire wherever we go

Deep in the shadows, afraid to come out
Even the good souls, fill me with doubt
I could never back down, only stand up and fight
We may be second best, but tonight is out night

When im close to the edge, fly high like an eagle
You keep holding me back, but there's fire wherever we go

Only the brave die young, only the brave run free
Only the brave rise up, only the brave victory

Only the brave
Only the brave

When Im close to the edge, fly high like an eagle
You keep holding me back, but there's fire wherever we go
When im close to the edge, fly high like an eagle
You keep holding me back, but there's fire wherever we go

Only the brave die young, only the brave run free
Only the brave rise up, only the brave victory

Only the brave
Only the brave
Only the brave
