Okay, now let's get this off my chest
We've made a burden for my travel
Pulled me down into your deepest depth
Should've left me on the calm cold surface

You know you make my soul scream
Will I ever survive?
These burdens take away from my dreams

Voices calling out from the dark
The night is an allusion for the lonesome
Have patience for once and find some for yourself
Unless the higher feeling takes over

You know you make my soul scream
Will I ever arrive?
Or will these screams define my dreams?

Own a beginning the ending is where I lack
Soft killer of the in between
Strapped for strength I'll find my way back
At least, this time, I came clean

You know you make my soul scream
Will I ever survive?
These burdens take away from my dreams
