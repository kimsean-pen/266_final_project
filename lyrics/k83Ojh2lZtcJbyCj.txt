I'll always be age seventeen
Wide eyed, with limbs still shaking
At home alone, the dial tone
Drags for hours on end
Hey mom i'll take the van
We'll drive it up and down the road
Without a plan
'cuz this is ending

Don't take me back
It won't be the same
Don't take me back
It won't be the same

We'll hit the spot
Yeah in a parking lot
We've got all the space that we need
I'm rich and poor, a few more weeks
Unlike the moon this is going down
Hey man we'll hop the fence
You've got my back I've got those curse
And its sinking in
Yeah i'm sinking

Hey dad i'm sleeping in
I'm dropping out when they step in
All alone again
And i'm drunk thinking

Don't take me back
It won't be the same
Don't take me back
It won't be the same
(i'll always be age seventeen)

"I still can't tell if I'm speeding up man, I feel like there's no way for me like... the rhythms that I play."
