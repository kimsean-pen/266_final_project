In a city that lives while its bright stars die
And you start to get old when you turn twenty-five
Where else can you go when you got that drive?
And everybody says when they arrive
It's not so bad in LA
The parking's cheap and vallet
Those blue skies day after day
It's not so bad in LA
Backyard got two lemon trees
Ten grams at the dispensary
Angels all left, but we'll stay
It's not so bad in LA
(LA)
And the ghosts of the nineties walk the streets
And the venice girls smile with the whites of their teeth
All licking their lips for a quick fifteen
Your appetite fades but you're still starving
It's not so bad in LA
The parking's cheap and vallet
Those blue skies day after day
It's not so bad in LA
Backyard got two lemon trees
Ten grams at the dispensary
Angels all left, but we'll stay
It's not so bad in LA
It's not so bad in LA
The parking's cheap and vallet
Those blue skies day after day
It's not so bad in LA
Backyard got two lemon trees
Ten grams at the dispensary
Angels all left, but we'll stay
It's not so bad in LA

I've been thinking so big
I think I better lie down
I've been thinking so big
I think I better lie down
