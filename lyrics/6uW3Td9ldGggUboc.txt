We live in a free world, I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling and the world will smile with you
Life is a flower, so precious in your hand
Carry on smiling and the world will smile with you
When every race is run
And the day is closing in
I don't care about the world
I'm living for the light
Don't cry for me today
We live in a free world, I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling and the world will smile with you
Life is a flower, so precious in your hand
Carry on smiling and the world will smile with you
I can not be your judge
Mr. Jailer is your host, he's keeping you inside
And hides you from the world
No catcher in the rye can help you from yourself
We live in a free world, I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling and the world will smile with you
Life is a flower, so precious in your hand
Carry on smiling and the world will smile with you
Please Mr. Agony, release them for a while
Learn them the consequences of living without life
We live in a free world, I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling and the world will smile with you
Life is a flower, so precious in your hand
Carry on smiling and the world will smile with you
We live in a free world
(It's a free world yeah)
Life is a flower ahh ahh ohh
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling snd the world will smile with you
Life is a flower, oh, so precious in your hand
Carry on smiling and the world will smile with you
We live in a free world
Carry on smiling and the world will smile with you
Life is a flower
Carry on smiling and the world will smile with you
We live in a free world
Carry on smiling and the world will smile with you
Life is a flower
Carry on smiling
