I bleed like a millionaire
My bones lay with dust in your care
Just don't leave this old dog to go lame
This life requires another name

Oh, so low
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
Oh
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
So low
Hallelujah
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)

You sold me a second hand joke
Young man, where there's fire there's smoke
Just don't leave this old dog to go lame
This life requires another name

(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
Oh
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
So low
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
Oh
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
So low
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
Hallelujah
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)
(I got lucky this time in the hunt for atonement)

Just don't leave this old dog to go lame
(Just don't leave this old dog to go lame)

I bleed like a millionaire
My bones lay with dust in your care
Just don't leave this old dog to go lame
This life requires another name
