Gun me down and break my bones to dust
Lay me down just kill me if you must
Make me cry just feel my brain with lies
There's nothing that surprises me lately
Life's a movie just play your evil part (evil part)
They never liked me I could tell that from the start
They wasn't fooling me
You never saw I got my heart pinned on my arm
Take my soul and stab my back
All that sin we can't take back
So (guide?) my eyes and fill my lungs with tar
Take my time it all go fast now
I'm on a ride but I'm low on gas now
So baby let's go back to the start
Before I have to fell apart
Gun me down and break my bones to dust
Lay me down just kill me if you must
Make me cry just feel my brain with lies
There's nothing that surprises me lately
Life's a movie just play your evil part (evil part)
They never liked me I could tell that from the start
They wasn't fooling me
You never saw I got my heart pinned on my arm
Take my soul and stab my back
All that sin we can't take back

Take my time it all go fast now
I'm on a ride but I'm low on gas now
