How did I get here, I heard a rumour
From your girlfriend's sister, that you knew me
And you end up dancing, close up to me

I know that I broke the rule already
She asked me if I'm single
Going steady
I just trod my head and took a step off into the dark

Standing on the block of my tires
Don't dance on the lights because the bears eat the pretty ones
We are like the islands divided

Jump to the beat of the party line
Jump to the beat of the party line
There is nobody here but your body, dear
Jump to the beat of the party line

Stay, you stay

I am on this morning quite distracted
The talk of all begins and our emotion
I am leaving many people feeling
Worse than before

People like to drive the cars and smoke up
People like to sit inside and toke up
People like to shoot at things with borrowed guns
And knives

I am happy to look and run
Where were you when I was king in this part of town
Now the days of glory are gone

Jump to the beat of the party line
Jump to the beat of the party line
There is nobody here but your body, dear
Jump to the beat of the party line

Jump to the beat of the party line
Jump to the beat of the party line
There is nobody here but your body, dear
Nobody here but your body dear

Jump to the beat of the party line
Jump to the beat of the party line
There is nobody here but your body, dear
Jump to the beat of the party line

Jump to the beat of the party line
Jump to the beat of the party line
There is nobody here but your body, dear
Nobody here but your body, dear
