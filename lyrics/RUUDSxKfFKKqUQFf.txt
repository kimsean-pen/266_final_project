Dig deeper than the surface
Find there's nothing but pain and burden
The scale is tilted at the reapers hand
Since inception, flesh is ruled by death

The march sustains against our fellow man
Hear the sound, the echo of intolerance
The land of attrition and pain
Step back, their hate is innate
Natural effect of a fucking cult
Morals gagged and hung by the throat
Block out all sound and reason
With every inch of me, I'll ensure you're beaten

Dig deeper than the surface
Find there's nothing but pain and burden
The scale is tilted at the reapers hand
Since inception, flesh is ruled by death

Social construct of a hateful bow
Your legion, I'll overthrow
Die by your weapon, your sword is dull
Redemption shot right through your skull
Frozen is your courage to speak out
You'll live in fear just as you were found
No platform for you to stand tall
Your leaders fucking fall

Dig deeper than the surface
You've caused nothing but pain and burden
Your reaping's over, the scale even
New inception, you're ruled by death

Your ideals will leave the earth
Nowhere to turn, you'll fucking burn
Your grave is dug, now lay in it
Your reign is over, Judiciary verdict
