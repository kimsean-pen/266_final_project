I can see you're inner motive
When you wear it on your face
Indisposed to the world
You won't let yourself be saved

You're the hand that spins my revolver around when
You push me away
You're the hand that spins my revolver around when
You push me away

On the waves of an ocean
I'm a space God in the rain
In the arms of devotion
Where you never found your place

You're the hand that spins my revolver around when
You push me away
You're the hand that spins my revolver around when
You push me away

You need no one to spin your revolver
So go and get my gun
You need no one to spin your revolver
So go and get my gun

You're the hand that spins my revolver around when
You push me away
You're the hand that spins my revolver around when
You push me away

I can see she's falling faster, running to her own disaster
You push me away
I can see she's falling faster, running to her own disaster
You push me away
