Don't you want somebody to never let you go?
Knowing someone's body better than your own
Don't you want a family with a white picket fence?
Tell me when's the wedding, the names of all your kids

I'm not missing someone that I've never met
Maybe a little scared, still I don't care
I'm not missing out so don't ask me again
Thanks for your concern, but here's the thing

I've never been in love
And it's all good
Not the only one
Feeling like they should
Maybe one day, some day
But no, I ain't in a rush
I say whatever, don't care that I've never
No, never been in love
I say whatever, don't care that I've never
No, never been in love

You can have your romance, go on a perfect date
But for me, there just ain't enough hours in the day
And I, don't mean to rain on your happiness
But I'm alone, with no loneliness
Never been in love
And it's all good
Not the only one
Feeling like they should
Maybe one day, some day
But no, I ain't in a rush
I say whatever, don't care that I've never
No, never been in love
(Never been in love)
(Never been in love, never been in love)
I say whatever, don't care that I've never
No, never been in love
(Never been in love)
(Never been in love, never been in love)
I say whatever, don't care that I've never
No, never been in love

I'm not missing someone that I've never met
(No no no no)
Maybe a little scared, still I don't care
I'm not missing out so don't ask me again
Thanks for your concern, but here's the thing

I've never been in love
And it's all good
Not the only one
Feeling like they should
Maybe one day, some day
But no, I ain't in a rush
I say whatever, don't care that I've never
No, never been in love
(Never been in love, never been in love)
I say whatever, don't care that I've never
No, never been in love

I say whatever, don't care that I've never
No, never been in love
