Can't spend time in rewind, I'm sorry
Many times I remind myself
We've come way too far in our stories, oh
To build these walls and to blind ourselves
And for every action, there's a reaction

And I know the world can be cold, we can't let it divide us
There's something inside us, a power that grows
There's something beautiful in the flaws in all we are
Something calling all of us and it says
We build bridges
Oh, we build bridges
No, we won't separate
We know love can conquer hate
So we build bridges
Bridges, not walls
Bridges, not walls
Bridges, not walls

I believe in the beauty of love (hey)
I believe that we really are one
I believe every woman is a fighter
And I believe every man can stand beside her

And I know the world can be cold, we can't let it divide us
There's something inside us, a power that grows
There's something beautiful in the flaws we all are
Something calling all of us and it says

We build bridges
Oh, we build bridges
No, we won't separate
We know love can conquer hate
So we build bridges
Bridges, not walls
Bridges, not walls
Bridges, not walls

All I pray is we break our chains
Because love's worth fighting for
Shed your light oh, oh, oh, oh
All I pray is we break our chains
Because love's worth fighting for
Shed your light oh, oh, oh, oh
All I pray is we break our chains
Because love's worth fighting for
Shed your light oh, oh, oh, oh
All I pray is we break our chains (all I pray is we break)
Because love's worth fighting for
Shed your light oh, oh, oh, oh
So we build bridges (All I pray is we break our chains)
So we build bridges (Because love's worth fighting for, shed your light oh)
So we build bridges (All I pray is we break our chains)
So we build bridges (Because love's worth fighting for, shed your light oh)

We build bridges (we build bridges, we build bridges)
Oh, we build bridges (we build bridges, we build bridges)
No, we won't separate (we build bridges, we build bridges)
We know love can conquer hate (we build bridges)
So we build bridges (we build bridges)
Bridges, not walls (we build bridges, we build bridges)
Bridges, not walls
