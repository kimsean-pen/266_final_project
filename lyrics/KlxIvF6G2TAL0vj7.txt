Oh, well I just don't know
How you could go without permission
Cause where (well?) if you're not there
Well I just don't care for this omission

Every moment brings me down when you're not around
But all I'm asking for is come back for just one day

So where did you go
And do you now know how to be happy
Cause here well it's pretty clear
When you're not near me I am unhappy

Every moment brings me down when you're not around
But all I'm asking for is come back for just one day
And make it worth the while just to see your smile
That's all I'm asking for

Oh I've come to know
You had to go without permission
Cause it was how, how I wore you down
And how I dragged you round my sole ambition

Every moment brings me down when you're not around
But all I'm asking for is come back for just one day
And make it worth the while just to see your smile
That's all I'm asking for, my dear
