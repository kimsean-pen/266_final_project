O Rosie
Where have you been
I couldn't save you
But I tried, Rosie
I tried
Why did you run
From everyone
Who only tried to
Love you, Rosie
Only tried
Little bird, if I only knew
Maybe I'd be more like you
Is it spring?
Do I sing?
Why do you run
From everyone
Who only tries to
Love you, only tries...
Maybe I like pleasure pain
Of going and coming back again
What I leave behind
I come back to find
It's no longer mine
So why not run
From everyone
Who only tries to
Love you, Rosie, only tries...
Little bird, if I only knew
Maybe I'd be more like you
Is it spring?
Do I sing?
Maybe I like pleasure pain
Of going and coming back again
What I leave behind
I come back to find
It's no longer mine
Little bird, if I only knew
Maybe I'd be more like you
Is it spring?
Do I sing?
