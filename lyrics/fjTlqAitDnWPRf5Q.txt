No matter what the people say
I can't, I can't let go
I can't let go
No, no, oh

Why must they try to tear down my house
When they know it's made from love
And they could never stand in my way
We made a vow to love through it all, we are one
And no one has the right to tear my love down

No matter what the people say
I'm gonna love you anyway
You are my life, I can't let go

Even if we fuss or fight
Try 'til we get it right
You are my life, I can't let go

Even if we disagree
You can put it all on me
You are my life, I can't let go
I can't, I can't let you go

How dare they say that a love like ours won't last?
God made no mistakes
When He sheltered me with your heart
There's no safer place than to be in love
And here I will stand and there ain't never
Ain't gonna never ever leave you alone

No matter what the people say
I'm gonna love you anyway
You are my life, I can't let go

Even if we fuss or fight
Try 'til we get it right
You are my life, I can't let go

Even if we disagree
You can put it all on me
You are my life, I can't let go
I can't, I can't let you go

All that I know now is to give you all of me
And no matter how long do I take
And every part of me, it belongs to your love
Help me, help me

No matter what the people say
I'm gonna love you anyway
You are my life, I can't let you go

Even if we fuss or fight
Try 'til we get it right
You are my life, I can't let you go

Even if we disagree
You can put it all on me
You are my life, I can't let you go
I can't, I can't let you go

No matter what the people say
People say
No matter what the people say
