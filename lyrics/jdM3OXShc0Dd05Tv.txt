I see the hole in the heart that you try
To fill with a drink
I see the light at the end of the dark
It might make you think
About where you've been babe
And what you've done
I know you hate this town
You're not the only one

I know you're hurting and you're feeling sold
I know it hurts when you don't know where to go
And when you're tied up by the past you hold
You've got to know
That you are good as gold

I see the crack in your ribs when you fell
Over your heels
I see your hurt by the words when he said
Love it ain't real
But let me hold you and tell you what I see
You are the light of the day
You mean so much to me

I know you're hurting and you're feeling sold
I know it hurts when you don't know where to go
And when you're tied up by the past you hold
You've got to know
That you are good as gold

Ooohhh
Good as gold
Ooohhh
Good as gold
Ooohhh
Good as gold
You gotta know
that you are good as gold

Shoulder to Shoulder
Yeah babe I'm on for the ride
We can run far away
Stay in the heat of July
Oh tonight
Push your troubles aside
We'll be alright

Good as gold
Yeah
You are good as gold
Yeah

I know you're hurting and you're feeling sold
I know it hurts when
you don't know where to go
And when you're tied up
by the past you hold
You've got to know
That you are good as gold

Ooohhh
Yeah you are
Good as gold
Ooohhh
Yeah you are
Good as gold

You've got you've got to know
Ooh
Good as gold
You've got to know
That you are good as gold
