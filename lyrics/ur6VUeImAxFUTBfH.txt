Virginia death threat
Virginia creeper vine
The hands that feed intent
Choke the purpose of this time
Take all that you can give
And I will make it mine
No care for what you've spent
Even fool's gold has its shine

Never held down, never restrained
Virtue's foot to the throat
Free of broken chains
Thus always to tyrants
Laugh at the conquered, the victims now betray

And in this commonwealth
There's merely a common concern for self
We hold these lies to be self-evident as the dividends will reflect
And in this commonwealth
There's merely a common concern for self
The coffers have long run dry

Never held down, never restrained
Virtue's foot to the throat
Free of broken chains
Thus always to tyrants
Laugh at the conquered, the victims now betray
The victims now betray

Like a bull in a china shop
But the shelves have all been cleared
A thief in an empty vault
The sheep already sheared
Like a bull in a china shop
But the shelves have all been cleared
A thief in an empty vault
The sheep already sheared
A screen door on a submarine
An eagle with a broken wing
Hope in a dead man's dream
The sound of a bell that will never ring

You're just wasting time
You're just wasting time
You're wasting time
