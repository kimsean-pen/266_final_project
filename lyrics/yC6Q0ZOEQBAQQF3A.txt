you're sick of the suburbs,
you tell me all the time,
and i guess,
we got so complacent,
you've got it in your mind,
dreaming as your globes and maps all spin
i don't wanna be your cultural cringe
don't you miss the summer,
we were happy then
and i know
that i craved your affection
or at least you were still nice enough to pretend
laying in the sun in your backyard
how did everything just get so hard?
and you put your things in a milo tin,
with all the different money from where you've been,
and a note i wrote, that you won't read,
cos every other boy is all you see.
you left in the winter,
you travelled all around
and i know that i was lost without you
but you say you got found
now I'm laying out in my front lawn
tryna get some sleep before its dawn
and you put your things in a milo tin,
with all the different money from where you've been,
and a note i wrote, that you won't read,
cos every other boy is all you see.
and i put your cards in a vegemite jar,
so we could never really be all that far
but I'm losing hope that this won't end
and ill be dead and gone before we mend.
you still put your things in a milo tin
i dont wanna be your cultural cringe
i put your cards in a vegemite jar
darling don't forget about who you are
