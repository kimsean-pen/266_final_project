Baby, it's you and me
You see, we can turn the night up
And if you feel the way I feel
We can turn the night up

Gimme some of that
Gimme some of that
Gimme some of that

Damn you look so sexy
Baby, you impress me
I wanna get nasty, nasty
Girl you got the bom bom
Take a shot, you want one
Mama, I can change your life

Gimme some of that

The way you do it
You got that something
You got that something
So keep it moving
You know I love it
You know I love it

Baby, it's you and me
You see, we can turn the night up
And if you feel the way I feel
We can turn the night up

Gimme some of that
Gimme some of that

Girl, your body's effing
You know my intentions
I know you can go all night, go all night
I just wanna touch you
Girl, just let me touch you
I know it's been on your mind

Gimme some of that

The way you do it
You got that something
You got that something
So keep it moving
You know I love it
You know I love it

Gimme some of that

One love, one love

From Madrid to Miami
From Miami to the world

Baby, it's you and me
You see, we can turn the night up
And if you feel the way I feel
We can turn the night up

Baby, it's you and me
You see, we can turn the night up
And if you feel the way I feel
We can turn the night up

Gimme some of that
