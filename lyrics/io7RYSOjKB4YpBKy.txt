I'm a little curious of you in crowded scenes
And how serene your friends and fiends
We flew and strolled as two, illuminated gently
Why don't you close your eyes and reinvent me?

You knew you got that heart made of stone
You shoulda let me know
You coulda let me know

We'll go 'till morning comes
And traffic grows
And windows hum

Spending all week with your friends
Give me evenings and weekends
Evenings and weekends

I could be yours
We can unwind
All these half floors
All these half floors

You'd agree it's a typical high
You fly as you watch your name go by
And once a name goes by
Not thicker than water nor thicker than mud
And the eight k thuds it does

Sunset so thickly
Let's make it quiet and quickly
Don't frown
Tastes better on the way back down

I could be yours
We can unwind
All these half floors
All these half floors
All these half floors
Will lead to mine

We are all curious

We can unwind
All these half floors
All these half floors
Will lead to mine

Will see to
All these half floors
All these half floors
Will see to
All these half floors
Will lead to mine

We can unwind all half floors
