They're calling out my name from inside the room
I can look tough, but I don't think they'll notice
The girl on the train looked kinda cute
And I don't know what to say

Open all my doors, but it is hard to face the truth
So I'm trying to remember what it is I always do

When I'm with you, I can only be me
When I'm with you, I can only be me
When I'm with you, I can only be me
When I'm with you, I can only be me

When I'm with you, you, you, you, you, you, you
When I'm with you, I can only be me
When I'm with you, I can only be me
When I'm with you, I can only be me
When I'm with you, I can only be me

Open all my doors, but it is hard to face the truth
So I'm trying to remember what it is I always do

When I'm with you, I can only be me
When I'm with you, I can only be me
When I'm with you, I can only be me
When I'm with you, I can only be me

When I'm with you, you, you, you, you, you, you
When I'm with you, I can only be me
When I'm with you, I can only be me
When I'm with you, I can only be me
When I'm with you, I can only be me
