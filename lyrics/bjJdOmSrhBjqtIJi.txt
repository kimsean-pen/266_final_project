Do you remember what he sayin'?
(I do, he told you he'd never) ever hurt you
Oh, here we go again

Another (break-up, make-up) when you're gonna wake up
I'm gon' be the one to call him out
Look how many times he let you down

When's he gonna learn to be a real man
I'll be the one to say you're beautiful
One more word he never said at all

I'm just sayin' you need to go
Forget that boy, forget that boy
We know that that boy ain't good enough for you

You're holding back tears in your eyes
That boy wanna fight but I never see him fighting for you
He'll never realize what he's got

Until it's gone (and he'll lose you forever)
Girl you'll be alright, forget that boy
Girl don't you know you set the tone?

I'll make you stop that, fight back
He won't get away with that
Look who's ringing up your phone

You wanna call back, leave that
Ain't nobody got time for that
It's funny how the tables turn

When he's the one who's left alone
You'll find your own real man and go
Forget that boy, forget that boy

We know that that boy ain't good enough for you
You're holding back tears in your eyes
That boy wanna fight but I never see him fighting for you
He'll never realize what he's got

Until it's gone
(And he'll lose you forever)
Girl you'll be alright, forget that boy
See what you're worth girl

Look what you've got
He knows you're out of his league
If he likes it or not
I know what you're worth girl

You know what you've got (Yeah)
He'll know you're out of his league
If he likes it or not (Likes it or not)
Ahh, ahh ooh yeah (Haah)

Forget that boy, forget that boy

We know that that boy ain't good enough for you
You're holding back tears in your eyes
That boy wanna fight but I never see him fighting for you
He'll never realize what he's got

Until it's gone
(And he'll lose you forever)
Girl you'll be alright, forget that boy
(That boy, that boy)

I know what you're worth girl
You know what you've got
We'll know you're out of his league

If he likes it or not
(Likes it or not)
Girl you'll be alright, forget that boy
Haah...
