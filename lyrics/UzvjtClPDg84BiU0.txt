All for the love of those eyes
Would you take the long way back again?
Singing this is the life
She was like the wind in your hair
You couldn't hold her, but she held you there
Just like the freshest air

Singing, can't we stay here
Middle of this feeling?
You had me dreaming
Will you bring me back there?

Remember when I used to say
You never took your shoes off at the door
Yeah, you just muddied all my thoughts
Well, love, I just want you to know
How I miss your running commentary
Beside me is an empty seat

You got me wondering all the things you're thinking
Hoping you might just crash through the ceiling

I have been alive, I have been alive
Well thank you for this whole surprise
I have been alive, I have been alive
Well thank you for this whole surprise
I have been alive, I have been alive
Thank you for this whole surprise
I have been alive, I have been alive
