Why you wanna play with my heart?
You see that something that you want?
So I'm going to say to you one more time
Go away, little girl
Go away
I'm not supposed to be with you alone
(The good life)
(The good life)
When you are near me like this
I find it hard to resist, oh
So go away, little girl
Before I beg you to stay
Please, baby, go away
Please, oh, go away
I find it hard
I find it hard, baby, to resist
And you know, baby, I think you're looking back in your memories
(I hope you find)
I think you're looking back in your
past for somebody that you had before
(The good life)
(I hope you find)
But I remember one thing
(The good life)
My lady (?) to me, she said
"Memories are the corners of my mind"
Misty-colored water, baby
Of the way we were
(I hope you find)
You know I'm gonna say it to you
(The good life)
Scary pictures of the smile we left behind
Were so painful to remember
Of the way we were
But, baby
(I hope you find)
(The good life)
Baby, baby
(I hope you find)
There's a lot of good meals out there with you
(The good life)
(I hope you find)
But right now
(The good life)
I may (?) what I have to give
(I hope you find)
And I can't just give it to you
(The good life)
I gotta give it to the world, baby
(I hope you find)
There's some way I hold the rose somewhere down the line
(The good life)
If you're meant for me
(I hope you find)
Then
(The good life)
So let it be but I'm gonna say
(I hope you find)
Bye, baby
(The good life)
Bye
(I hope you find)
(The good life)
Hope you find a good life
(I hope you find)
(The good life)
Hope you find good love
(I hope you find)
(The good life)
I'm not the one for you, baby
(I hope you find)
(The good life)
Oh, I'm not the one for you, baby
(I hope you find)
(The good life)
Find someone
(I hope you find)
(The good life)
Find someone to love you, baby
(I hope you find)
Right now
(The good life)
I'm not the one
Oh, baby
I hope you have a good life
I hope you find someone
(I hope you find)
(The good life)
Yeah
