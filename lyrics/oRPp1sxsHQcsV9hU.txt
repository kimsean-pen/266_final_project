He had it good
A life too easy
On his mother's tit too long
Made a boy too needy
Picture perfect picket fencing
Robbing him his chance
To grow up right and feel heartbreak
Utopia's a scam

Some will float and some will sink
There is only one way to find out
Fear of pain or love of drink
So many ways fools can drown
Shaaaaaa...
Late bloomers bloom

Nothing prepares you for circumstance that rips your heart apart
Never lied to but he never saw the world outside the yard
Sorrows a lonely trap
One death was the last straw
Skin was too thin
He never held up his guard

Some will float and some will sink
There is only one way to find out
Fear of pain or love of drink
So many ways fools can drown
Shaaaaaa...
Late bloomers bloom

Late to whither, late to bloom
Chance of pain, run back to the womb
Give you more time to brew
Temporary haven from the truth

When the water broke
He was unprepared to feel something real
He paints his pain in a blackout
(Now he's got too stepping out)
Somethings missing from his eyes
(Taking on his spirit to rise)
He paints his pain in a blackout
(Now he's got too stepping out)
Shaaaaaa...
Late bloomers bloom
