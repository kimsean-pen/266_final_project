Have no time to wake up
No time to be sober
Exercise the morning
Don't make me do things over

Sleepy eyes they got me
Sleepy eyes have no time, no time

Have no time for sunbeams
I'll see them in my dreams
Exercise in full speed
Don't make me do this over

Sleepy eyes they got me
Sleepy eyes have no time, no time

Have no time to wake up
No time to be sober
Exercise the morning
Don't make me do things over

Sleepy eyes they got me
Sleepy eyes have no time, no time

Have no time for sunbeams
I'll see them in my dreams
Exercise in full speed
Don't make me do this over

Sleepy eyes they got me
Sleepy eyes have no time, no time
