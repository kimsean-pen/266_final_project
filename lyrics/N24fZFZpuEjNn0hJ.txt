Frosty the snowman, going, I'm going
I don't see no one, I don't feel no one
Frosty the snowman, going, I'm going
I don't see no one, I don't feel no one

Trashbags on the window, but I don't play Nintendo
Can't even pick up the phone, everything is cancelled
I'm not special, I'm not special
You're just like me, I'm not special
Echoes of your ringtone sound better than my singles
Leave me injured, stab me with a pencil
It's so simple, drop me like a pencil
Tell me insults, tell me like it is, yeah
Trapped with you, yeah, you give me Stockholm syndrome
She a nympho, I'm not really shit though
Drop a pin though, or just drop a signal
Lost my signal, just delete my info
Walk with me, walk with me, walk away from me
Change shape for me, I know you hate on me
Walk with me, walk away from me
Change shape for me, I know you hate on me

Frosty the snowman, going, I'm going
Going, I'm going, and I don't fuck with no one
Frosty the snowman, going, I'm going
I don't see no one, I don't feel no one

I love when you use me up
Your love could have fooled me, yea
My money, shoot me, yea
Can't feel, execute me, yea
You love when you use me, yea
Your love could have fooled me, yea
Take my money and shoot me, yea
Can't, everything is canceled

Frosty the snow man, going, I'm going
I don't see no one, I don't feel no one (can't feel, execute me)
Frosty the snow man, going, I'm going
I don't see no one, I don't feel no one
Walk with me, walk with me or walk away from me
Change shape for me, I know you hate on me
Walk with me or walk away from me
Change shape for me, I know you hate on me
I know you hate on me, walk away from me
