A photo held in front of you
Or held in front of me
Can't tell us what we both already knew
Its not too hard to see
We're not the same as who we were before
Who we were before
Doesn't matter anymore
Who we were before

A photo in your old passport
Of you at age fourteen
It doesn't look much like you anymore
The past is just a dream

You're not the same as who you were before
Who you were before
Doesn't matter anymore
Who you were before
