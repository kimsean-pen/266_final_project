I can see the void,
Dark like prison.
Take me to the eyes of this boy.
And now dance with me.

I can see the world,
Sharp like paper.
Take me to the eyes of this girl.
And now dance with me.

You found this one long kiss.
Your shadow stays forever in a safe tonight,
I'm falling to the ending.
Dance with me.

Oh tonight I'm a teenage queen.
(Sometimes I feel so beautiful.)
Oh tonight I'm a teenage queen and it never stops.
The world we live wont laugh this hard.
The weight of the world wont seem so bad now.

Well, can you feel the noise?
Cut like ribbon,
Take me to the girl and this boy.
And now dance with me.

Well, you found this one long kiss,
Your shadow stays forever in a safe tonight.
I'm falling to the ending.
Dance with me.

Oh tonight I'm a teenage queen.
(Sometimes I feel so beautiful.)
Oh tonight I'm a teenage queen.
(Sometimes I feel so beautiful.)
Oh tonight I'm a teenage queen and it never stops.

The world we live wont laugh this hard.
The weight of the world wont seem so bad now.

Break break break break, now I'm coming to,
Tonight tonight I'm a teenage queen.
Take take take take, now I'm coming to.
She walks by and I feel serene.
(x2)

Oh tonight I'm a teenage queen.
(Sometimes I feel so beautiful.)
Oh tonight I'm a teenage queen.
(Sometimes I feel so beautiful.)
Oh tonight I'm a teenage queen and it never stops.

The world we live wont laugh this hard.
The weight of the world won't seem so bad now.
