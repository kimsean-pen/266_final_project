I have so many questions and places to go
There are too many options far too many unknowns
This is why I need you

Everyone talks now but no one is right
There are too many armies with no one to fight
This is why I need you

Cause you make the darkness less dark
You make the edges less sharp
You make the winter feel warmer
You make my weakness less weak
You make the bottom less deep
You make the waiting feel shorter
You make my crazy feel normal, every time
You are the who, love is the what and this is the why

There are too many problems and no one who cares
There are so many roads and they all need repairs
This is why I need you

There's not enough chocolate, there's too many chores
There are so many mountains that I haven't explored
This is why I need you

Cause you make the darkness less dark
You make the edges less sharp
You make the winter feel warmer
You make my weakness less weak
You make the bottom less deep
You make the waiting feel shorter
You make my crazy feel normal, every time
You are the who, love is the what and this is the why
You keep the ship moving forward
You make it easy to try
You make my crazy feel normal, every time
You are the who, love is the what and this is the why
You are the who, love is the what and this is the why
You are the who, love is the what and this is the why
