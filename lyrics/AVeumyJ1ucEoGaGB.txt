Nobody can hear you
When your spark is not a flame
And your heartbeat's just a whisper
And nobody knows your name
No one understands you
But everyone's the same
And everybody bleeds
But you might not see the pain

Yeah, we all begin
On the outside looking in
So we all die young
We're wearing thin
Thinking 'bout what could've been
While we all die young

Nothing's ever easy
When your world just falls apart
And you shatter into pieces
And you don't know where to start
All the world's a stage
So we all just play our part
And everybody watches
But they might not see the heart

Yeah, we all begin
On the outside looking in
So we all die young
We're wearing thin
Thinking 'bout what could've been
While we all die young

We are reborn from the bottom
We are long gone but not forgotten
Still we stay

Woah! Woah! Woah! Woah!
Woah! Woah! Woah! Woah!

Yeah, we all begin
On the outside looking in
So we all die young
We're wearing thin
Thinking 'bout what could've been
While we all die young

While we all die young
