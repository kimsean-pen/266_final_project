Is it the end, or is it just me?
Will it happen that we'll be set free?
Chaos is near: the fear of all fears
Shall we continue to hope when faith starts to bleed?
When truth isn't told and still controls a fold... I feel blind
I'm questioning myself but I can't find...
I try to dream but sleep took off.
I felt not sure and went for a walk.
It is the end and we are not to blame.
We'll feel free at last and the game will end
This game will end...
I feel like I've been told lies from the day I was born
Enacting a story that is not mine, is it enough of a burden?
I try to climb between the doubts that are surrounding my mind
I don't feel free and guess what; I don't feel that I'm being me.
