Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

It's not easy for a heart that's stuck in limbo
But it's okay 'cause you're a bum and I'm a bimbo
I am not the one you're looking for
'Cause I am not your window or your door

I'm not staying in, watch you go (?)
And I guess I move too slow
The world's got other plans
And I reached out way too low
And I guess that now I know
The world's got other plans
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah it's true we both decided to be free
And I hear you're going crazy without me
But do you put yourself behind those bars?
I can't be your one and only star (?)

I've stayed in, watched you go
And I guess I move too slow
The world's got other plans
And I reached out way too low
And I guess that now I know
The world's got other plans
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yes, now I know
I move too slow
(That's how I know we cannot be
It's all right, okay by me)

I stayed in, watched you go
And I guess I move too slow
The world's got other plans
And I reached out way too low
And I guess that now I know
The world's got other plans
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
