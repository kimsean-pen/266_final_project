The sirens are screamin'
And the fires are howlin'
Way down in the valley tonight
There's a man in the shadows
With a gun in his eye
And a blade shinin' oh so bright
There's evil in the air
And there's thunder in the sky
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets

Oh and down in the tunnel
Where the deadly are rising
Oh I swear I saw a young boy
Down in the gutter
He was starting to foam in the heat
Oh baby, you're the only thing
In this whole world
That's pure and good and right
And wherever you are

And wherever you go

There's always gonna be some light
But I gotta get out
I gotta break it out now
Before the final crack of dawn
So we gotta make the most
Of our one night together
When it's over you know
We'll both be so alone
Like a bat out of Hell

I'll be gone when the morning comes
Oh, when the night is over

Like a bat out of Hell
I'll be gone, gone, gone
Like a bat out of Hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes
But when the day is done
And the sun goes down

And the moonlight's shinin' through
Then like a sinner
Before the gates of Heaven

I'll come crawlin' on back to you
I'm gonna hit the highway
Like a battering ram
On a silver black Phantom bike
Oh, when the metal is hot
And the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light
Nothing ever grows

In this rotting old hole
And everything is stunted and lost
And nothing really rocks
And nothing really rolls

And nothing's ever worth the cost
And I know that I'm damned
If I never get out
And baby, I'm damned if I do
But with every other beat

I got left in my heart
You know I'd rather be damned with you
Well if I gotta be damned
You know I wanna be damned
Dancing through the night with you

Well if I gotta be damned
You know I wanna be damned
Gotta be damned
You know I wanna be damned
Gotta be damned

You know I wanna be damned
Dancing through the night
Dancing through the night
Dancing through the night with you
Oh baby, you're the only thing
In this whole world

That's pure and good and right

And wherever you are
And wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light
But I gotta get out
I gotta break it out now
Before the final crack of dawn
So we gotta make the most

Of our one night together
When it's over you know
We'll both be so alone

Like a bat out of Hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes
Oh when the night is over

Like a bat out of Hell
I'll be gone, gone, gone
Like a bat out of Hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes
But when the day is done

And the sun goes down
And the moonlight's shining through
Then like a sinner

Before the gates of Heaven
I'll come crawling on back to you
Then like a sinner
Before the gates of Heaven
I'll come crawling on back to you
I can see myself tearin' up the road

Faster than any other boy has ever gone
Oh and my skin is raw but my soul is ripe
And no one's gonna stop me
Now I'm gonna make my escape
But I can't stop thinking of you
And I never see the sudden curve
Till it's way too late
And I never see the sudden curve
Till it's way too late
Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit
In the blazin' sun
Torn and twisted
At the foot of a burnin' bike
And I think somebody somewhere
Must be tolling a bell
And the last thing I see
Is my heart, still beatin'
Breakin' out of my body
And flyin' away
Like a bat out of Hell
Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit
In the blazing sun
All torn and twisted
At the foot of a burnin' bike
And I think somebody somewhere
Must be tollin' a bell
And the last thing I see
Is my heart, still beatin', still beatin'
Breakin' out of my body
And flyin' away
Like a bat out of Hell
Oh, like a bat out of Hell
Oh, like a bat out of Hell
Oh, like a bat out of Hell
Oh, like a bat out of Hell
Oh, like a bat out of Hell
Oh, like a bat out of Hell
