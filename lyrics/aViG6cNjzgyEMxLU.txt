Are you my lady, are you
My lady are you, are you
My lady are you my lady, are you
My lady are you, are you?

If I don't make it back from the city
Then it is only because I am drawn away
For you see, evidently there's a dark storm coming
And the chain on my swing is squeaking like a mouse, so

Are you my lady, are you
My lady are you, are you
(The rain, the rain, the rain) My lady are you, my lady are you
(is falling down, the cars remain) My lady are you, are you

You're tall just like a giraffe
You have to climb to find its head
But if there's a glitch
You're an ostrich
You've got your head in the sand

In a submersible I can hardly breathe
As it takes me inside, so the light sings
Answer me truthfully, do the clouds kiss you?
With meringue-coloured hair, I know they cannot, so

(The rain, the rain, the rain) Are you my lady, are you
(is falling down, the cars remain) My lady are you, are you
(The rain, the rain, the rain) My lady are you, my lady are you
(is falling down, the cars remain) My lady are you, are you

Santa Ana winds bring seasickness
Zookeeper hear me out
How dare you go?
Cold in the rain

Tall just like a giraffe
You have to climb to find its head
But if there's a glitch
You're an ostrich
You've got your head in the sand

Are you my lady, are you
My lady are you, are you
(The rain, the rain, the rain) My lady are you, my lady are you
(is falling down, the cars remain) My lady are you, are you
(The rain, the rain, the rain) My lady are you, my lady are you (I could not)
(is falling down, the cars remain) My lady are you, are you (be seen with you)

(The rain, the rain, the rain) My lady are you, my lady are you (I could not)
(is falling down, the cars remain) My lady are you, are you (be seen with you)
(The rain, the rain, the rain) My lady are you, my lady are you (Working half the time)
(is falling down, the cars remain) My lady are you, are you (and looking fine in cars re-made)
(The rain, the rain, the rain) My lady are you, my lady are you (Working half the time)
(is falling down, the cars remain) My lady are you, are you (and looking fine in cars re-made)
(The rain, the rain, the rain) My lady are you, my lady are you (Working half the time)
(is falling down, the cars remain) My lady are you, are you (and looking fine in cars re-made)
(The rain, the rain, the rain) My lady are you, my lady are you (Working half the time)
(is falling down, the cars remain) My lady are you, are you (and looking fine in cars re-made)
(The rain, the rain, the rain) My lady are you, my lady are you (Working half the time)
(is falling down, the cars remain) My lady are you, are you (and looking fine in cars re-made)
