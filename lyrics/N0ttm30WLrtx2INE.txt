The long courier makes haste to end
To give us night
He was concerned with the buildings
He was concerned with the gardens, dealings of all of this
Of all of this

I guess you did it to me
I guess you did it to me
You got me down
What did you do to me
What did you do to me
(You got me down)

What you do to me
I guess they did to me
You got me down
What did you do to me
You got me down
(You got me down)

I guess you do to me
I guess you do to me
You got me down
I guess you do to me
I guess you did to me
You got me down
