I don't know much about the history now
Don't know much about biology
Don't much about the science book
Don't know much about the French I took
All I do know is I love you now
And I wonder if you love me, too
Ooh what a Wonderful World this could be

I don't know much about geography now
Don't know much about trigonometry now
Don't know much about the algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for
But I do know one and one is two now
And I wonder if you love me, too
Ooh what a Wonderful World this could be

I don't claim to be an "A" student
But that's what I'm trying to be
But by being an "A" student, baby
Looks like I could win your love for me

Don't know much about the history now
Don't know much about biology
I don't much about the science book now
Don't know much about the good French I took
All I do know is I love you now
And I wonder if you love me, too
Ooh what a Wonderful World this could be

I don't claim to be an "A" student
But that's what I'm trying to be
But if I have to be an "A" student, baby
I'm gonna win your love for me

I don't know much about geography now
Don't know much about trigonometry
Don't know much about the algebra now
Don't know what a good slide rule is for
But I do know one and one is two now
And I wonder if you love me, too
Ooh what a Wonderful World this could be

Good lord, I been trying
I been trying, I been trying...
