Call out all my demons
tell them I will take the fall
I'm sick of all these headaches
from banging my head against the wall
I wrap myself in cellophane
to blend into the streets
I won't tell where I'm hiding
until the blood gets to my face

So today I'm waking up to find that all I have inside wasn't worth it
I'm living out my broken dreams
I'm flying with a crippled wing

and my life isn't
tearing at the seams
But I will fall until I find myself
Stuck in the middle

'til I'm stuck in the middle

Falling into circumstances
I cannot control
It's stomping out my politics
and eating out my soul
I cut the dust out of my lungs
and spit it down the drain

I reach inside my head
and pull the cockroach from my brain
So today I'm waking up to find that all I have inside wasn't worth it
I'm living out my broken dreams

I'm flying with a crippled wing
and my life isn't
tearing at the seams
But I will fall until I find myself

Stuck in the middle
Cross my heart and hope for the end
Look under the boards that are starting to bend

Loosen the rope slippin' over my head
Either I'm free or I'm already dead
So take me over (take me over)
Take me closer (take me closer)
Is it over? (Is it over?)
Cross my heart and hope for the end
Either I'm free or I'm already dead
I'm living out my broken dreams
I'm flying with a crippled wing
and my life isn't
tearing at the seams
But I will fall until I find myself
Stuck in the middle
'til I'm stuck in the middle
But I will fall until I find myself
Stuck in the middle
