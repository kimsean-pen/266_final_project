Is the passion all gone?
Or is it still newly-wed?
If all this heat's doing
Is making us stick to the bed
Then there's no life to revive
But if the hunger's still there
Burried somewhere inside
Covered up by the boredom
We've been trying to hide
Then dig it up
And devour
And it'll seem more like a song
And less like it's math
When you pull on my hair
And bite me like that
It'll seem more like a song
And less like it's math
When you pull on my hair
And bite me like that
It'll seem more like a song
Yeah more like song
And the truth is that I can hardly wait
I don't care if we stay up too late
Don't answer the phone
Don't answer the phone
And it'll seems more like a song
And less like it's math
When you pull on my hair
and bite me like that
It'll seems more like a song
And less like it's math
When you pull on my hair
And bite me like that
And bite me like that
And bite me and scratch me like that
And the truth is that I can hardly wait
And It's so bad I can't concentrate
Don't answer the phone
Don't answer the phone
And it'll seem more like a song
And less like it's math
When you pull on my hair
And bite me like that
It'll seems more like a song
And less like it's math
When you pull on my hair
And bite me like that
And bite me like that
And scratch me and bite me like that
