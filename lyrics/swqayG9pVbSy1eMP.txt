Even if I wanted to love you
Would you love me?
Even if I wanted to fall for you
Would you fall for me?
Even if I never meant to hurt you
Would you hurt me?
Even if I wanted to pray for you

Hold me, hold me close
Never let go
Tell me what you need, and I promise I'll take control
And even if I wanted to run with you
Would you run with me?
Even if I wanted to own you
Even if I never meant to hurt you
Would you hurt me?
Even if I wanted to pray for you

Hold me, hold me close

In the middle of the night I feel your presence taking control
So many reasons
Don't try to take what you didn't wanna start

So many reasons
Don't try to take what you didn't wanna start

Hold me, hold me close
Never let go
Tell me what you need, and I promise I'll take control
Even if I wanted to love you
Would you love me?
Even if I wanted to fall for you
Would you fall for me?
Even if I never meant to hurt you
Would you hurt me?
Even if I wanted to pray for you
