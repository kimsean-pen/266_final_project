That night her kiss told me it was over
I walked out late into the dark
The misty gloom seems to soak up my sorrow
The further I went on
I felt a spreading calm
Then suddenly my eyes were bathed in light
And the lovely lady in white was by my side
She said "Like me I see you're walking alone
Won't you please stay?"
I couldn't look away

She said
I love the night
The day is OK and the sun can be fun but I live
To see those rays slip away
I love the night
There's so much I can show and give to you
If you will welcome me tonight

If only you had been there my dear
We could have shared this together

No mortal was meant to know such wonder
One look in the mirror told me so
Come darkness I'll see her again
Yes I'm gonna go
'Cause now I know

I love the night
The day is OK and the sun can be fun but I live
To see those rays slip away

I love the night
I love the night
I love the night
