So you think you've won
Come take a walk inside
This enraged, pissed off mind
It's calling for you

Feel, feel my hatred
It bleeds down on your faith

Lusted for so long
For the moment
Lying broken in a corner
Here it comes

Feel, feel my hatred
It bleeds down on your fate
Feel, feel your ending
It's so grim and cold here

How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you
How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you

Ancient and immortalized
Will be my hate forever
For your kind
Human-kind

Feel, feel my hatred
It bleeds down on your fate
Feel, feel your ending
It's so grim and cold here

How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you
How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you

How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you
How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you
How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you
