There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all

When the dark of the night
Comes around, that's the time
That the animal comes alive
Looking for somethin' wild

N-Now we lookin' like pimps in my gold Trans-Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey in my handbag
Got my drunk text on
I'll regret it in the mornin'
But tonight I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a…

There's a place downtown

And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off

E'rybody breakin' bottles, it's a filthy hot mess
And I'm down to get faded
I'm not the designated driver
So I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a…

There's a place I know

Oh, oh, oh
Everybody take it off
Oh, oh, oh
Everybody take it off
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
Oh
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
Everybody take it off
