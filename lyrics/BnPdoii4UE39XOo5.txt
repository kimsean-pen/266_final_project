And I could look into the crowded morgue of mistakes
The sun stopped its smile and frowned on me too
My re-built, re-mastered heart is smashed into its faces
And its face is confused

I cut my throat in two, I said "sorry" to you,
For being a fool but I didn't want forgiveness
It was regret, not an apology
It was regret, regret, regret

Dis, dis, dis
Disengaged
Dis, dis, dis
Disengaged

You're with me, against me
But the only thing forever is hate

Forget what I saw before and after that day
I'd trade all I was worth to make myself in to
The handsomest gun and put the diamond bullet
Into your 404 error face

Dis, dis, dis
Disengaged
Dis, dis, dis
Disengaged

You're with me, against me
But the only thing forever is hate

And I'm an event everybody knows
You decide if you can live
Or you decide to let someone decide for you

Dis, dis, dis
Disengaged
Dis, dis, dis
Disengaged

You're with me, against me
But the only thing forever is hate
