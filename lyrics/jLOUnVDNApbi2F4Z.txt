Cinematic, take it right back
With a bottle of perfume lotion
Where'd you come from talking like that?
Butterfly from the bottom of the ocean
And I can't stop this slow motion trip

Been away with me, no politics
It's a perfect notion
Your gravity has got me bowing in devotion
You and me fit a magic trick

If I'm dancing, if I'm dancing, if I'm dancing
I know the music's good
If we're dancing, if we're dancing, if we're dancing
I know that we'll be good

One look at him and I see candy-coated heart shapes
The jewels and furniture can go
But, baby, he stays
He plays sitar, three notes so far

If I'm dancing, if I'm dancing, if I'm dancing
I know the music's good (did you get that?)
If we're dancing, if we're dancing, if we're dancing
I know that we'll be good

My chakra's open green and red
But he wants blue and green instead (let's just do it over)
My chakra's open green and red
But he wants blue and green instead

If I'm dancing, if I'm dancing, if I'm dancing
I know the music's good
If we're dancing, if we're dancing, if we're dancing
I know that we'll be good
