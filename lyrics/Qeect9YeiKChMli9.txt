Faster, faster, faster, faster

Time's moving onwards
Pushing and pulling me
Offering no release
Where do we go now
Why can't we pause and stay
I'm hanging on the
Pendulum below the clock
Please swing slower, make it stop

Can we end the endings?
Can we make believe this will last forever?
I don't mind pretending
Still you push me
Still you push me

Faster, faster

Time's moving onwards
Turning the night to day
I'm jumping on the brakes
Where does this thing go
Why can't we pause and stay
I'm just afraid to
Realize as I look up
Who's getting off at the next stop

Can we end the endings?
Can we make believe this will last forever?
I don't mind pretending
Still you push me
And the endings now

Can we end the endings?
Can we make believe this will last forever?
I don't mind pretending
Still you push me
Still you push me

Faster, faster, faster, faster
