I'm a beggar, but I'm choosy with my love
'Cause I've had cheap drugs before
But I want you more

She's like Balenciaga
I got a spendin' problem
But I'll just let my line of credit
Do the problem solvin'
I like to hover just above rock bottom
So I never fall farther than an apple in autumn

I keep my bags light
Gang sight
Always ready for a flat
Take the Monday overnight
We'll find a brand new country
Where the dollar goes farther
'Cause everywhere we go we let
The milkin' honey's know

I'm a beggar but I'm choosy with my love
'Cause I've had cheap drugs before
But I want you more

You're the only one
I'd trust to catch my rush
'Cause I've had cheap drugs before
But I want you more

Partyin' the sandy model
While workin' at the concierge
Drop the most expensive bottle
As long as it ain't mine it's there's

I pull up in that rose venom
I hope the owner tips me well
I drop the cash off with my friend
Gets me fifty off a wire cell

'Cause I'm so done, done with that fast fashion
I want the best that my debt can get
'Cause it's alright, it's okay
Ima drop this beat today
Watch the money flow my way

I'm a beggar but I'm choosy with my love
'Cause I've had cheap drugs before
But I want you more

You're the only one
I'd choose to catch my rush
'Cause I never been more satisfied
With you just blessed out here by my side

In this penthouse suite and garden
Can't afford it but I'm chargin'
'Cause I made the banks a promise
They know I'm starvin' for ya

She's like Balenciaga when you only fuck with ZARA
They know I'm starvin' for ya
