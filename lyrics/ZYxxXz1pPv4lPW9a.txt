So blue, so blue, so blue
She was an Oxycontin girl in a heroin world
She didn't know what to do
When she ran out of pills she scored on the street
And now her lips are turning blue
So blue so blue

She was daddy's little girl
In a bubblegum world
Weaning off the silver spoon
A drama club kid
She moved to New York
To make her big stage debut
But who knew, who knew
She'd soon be blue

Didn't anybody tell her not to
Did anyone say she shouldn't go
Who stepped up and said she shouldn't ought to
Who's gonna be the one to drive her to the ER
So blue, so blue
So blue, so blue

So blue, so blue, so blue
So blue, so blue
So blue, so blue

So blue, so blue

The Oxycontin girl in a heroin world
Was fending for her boyfriend too
When they ran out of cash
He put her on the streets
And then they called her "Baby Blue"
So blue, so blue, so blue

That Oxycontin girl in a heroin world
Never really had a clue
When she took a hot hit
She scored off the streets
Her lips started turning blue
Who knew what to do
So blue, so blue
So blue, so blue
So blue, so blue

What's she gonna say to her parents
What are we going to say to the law
Did anybody see her coming down here
Who's going to be the one to drop her at the ER
So blue, so blue, so blue, so blue
So blue, so blue, so blue, so blue
