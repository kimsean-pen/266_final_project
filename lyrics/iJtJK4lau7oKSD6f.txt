You've been searching
Have you found many things?
Time for learning
Why have I not learned a thing?

Ooh woah ohh, words with no meaning
Have kept me dreaming
But they don't tell me anything

And all you never say is that, you love me so
All I'll never know is, if you want me oh
If only I could look into your mind
Maybe then I'd find a sign
Of all I want to hear you say to me, to me

Are you uncertain?
Or just scared to drop your guard?
Have you been broken?
Are you afraid to show your heart?

Ooh woah ohh, life can be unkind
But only sometimes
You're giving up before you start

And all you never say is that, you love me so
All I'll never know is, if you want me oh
If only I could look into your mind
Maybe then I'd find a sign
Of all I want to hear you say to me

All you never say is that, you love me so
All I'll never know is if you want me oh
If only I could look into your mind
Maybe then I'd find a sign
Of all I want to hear you say to me, to me
