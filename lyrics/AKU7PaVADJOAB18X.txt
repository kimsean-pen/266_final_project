There are things we can't control learning to let go ain't easy
I've watched the tide rise and fall
And it doesn't phase me
I must let you know it doesn't get easier no not easier
I must let you know it doesn't get easier
But still we try

We can't
Go back

But why would you want to?

There are things we can't control
I'll let you know when I get past that and
Tell me where my dreams will go
If they fall into a million pieces
