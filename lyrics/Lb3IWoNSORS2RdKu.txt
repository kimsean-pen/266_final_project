Sent to the islands to secure what is ours
Marching ashore in the cover of night
Hide until dawn and attack in the twilight
Shake them awake with the thunder of guns
Orders from the iron maiden
(get the islands back)
Failure will not be accepted
Call for artillery strike
Launch attack

We are (back in control)
Force them to surrender
(take what is ours)
Restore law and order
(back in control)
Push them further out to sea
(falklands in our hands),
Back under british reign

Push them back further and out from the islands
Into our fleet that will stop their retreat
Mark their positions and call in the airforce
Harriers and vulcans strikes at our command
Orders from the iron maiden
(get the islands back)
Failure will not be accepted
Call for artillery strike
Launch attack

We are (back in control)
Force them to surrender
(take what is ours)
Restore law and order
(back in control)
Push them further out to sea
(falklands in our hands)
Back under british reign

Back in control
Force them to surrender
Take what is ours
Restore law and order
(back in control)
Push them further out to sea
(falklands in our hands)

(back in control)
Force them to surrender
