Realized I knew you from
His photo when you walked
Into the restaurant
And my heart just sunk
Your friend looked over from the bar
She must've known, who I was
The worst possible version of what I'd done
As, seating couples
I tried to listen

By the time it's old
A face will have been seen
One and a half
Million times
One million times
I don't know why I worry, I mean
Maybe she didn't recognize me

I call you enemy
Cause I'm afraid of
What you could call me
The world's gotten so small and
Embarrassing

By the time it's old
My face will have been seen
And I'll share a very
Common poverty
It's a very common kind
Common kind, common kind
It's a very common kind
It's not that I am worried
I just wish you and your friends would leave

We've long since closed now
Still you and some others, stick around
You and some others stick around
You and some others stick around
We've long closed now, still
You and some others stick around
You and some others stick around
You and some others stick around
