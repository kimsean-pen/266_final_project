This Eden!

This Eden is our paradise forever!

Rebirth, awakened we've only begun
No longer forsaken the two are now one!

We are here by design
I am yours and you are mine
Eternally intertwined
This Eden is our paradise forever!

This Eden is our paradise forever!

Eons behind us not captive to time
A future before us that we will define!

We are here by design
I am yours and you are mine
Eternally intertwined
This Eden is our paradise forever!

This Eden is our paradise...

This Eden!

All alone and in our own starlight tonight
We'll traverse the universe tonight!

We are here by design
I am yours and you are mine
Eternally intertwined
This Eden is our paradise...

We are here by design
I am yours and you are mine
Eternally intertwined
This Eden is our paradise forever!

This Eden is our paradise forever!
This Eden is our paradise forever!
This Eden is our paradise forever!

This Eden!

This Eden is our paradise forever!

This Eden!
