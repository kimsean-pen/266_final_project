Time to send someone away
Not me,
I'm not in
Sad how you've been all lead astray
Go on count your chins

Wolves are all lined up waiting
Trick is to not move
Showing off with jewelry
Humiliation will be your new rule

Time to send someone away
I've got my back covered
Sad how you've been all lead astray
Come, let's count, it's subsumed

They lead you to their maze
When no ones asked them to
But hey, you're walking over bodies
Just to witness something new
Just to witness something new

Time to send someone away
Not me,
I'm not in
Feel that summer rain
It's in your face again
Feel that summer rain
It's in your face again
Feel that summer rain
It's in your face again
Feel that summer rain
It's in your face again
Feel that summer rain
It's in your face again
