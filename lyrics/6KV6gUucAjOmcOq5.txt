When I'm walking down the empty streets
You're always in my mind, always
As a shell of melting secret words
You're always in my mind, always
I can feel your whispering inside of noisy dreams
Through the ceiling of a room,
The echo of your voice
As a wave brought by the wind
Is calling from the void
Now I recognize the sound where theres no sound at all
When you are sad, tears are not enough
Everytime you lose yourself in yearning
When you are sad, days are not enough
Time never stops before your eyes
When you are sad, rest is not enough
All your efforts seem to be ignored
When you are sad, beauty is not enough
Makebelieve is all you see around you.
