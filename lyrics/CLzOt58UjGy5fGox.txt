I gave you yesterday
Tomorrow's no concern
I gave you yesterday
You can keep it
Because today is mine

Time is envious and running away
Now let's live it up while we may
Rather at once our moments devour
Let's all languish in the sound of power
Feel the rising tones
Taste the dust we kick up with friends
Louder it stings our ears
For now we don't hurt or fear

I gave you yesterday
I don't want it back

I gave you yesterday
Tomorrow's no concern
I gave you yesterday
You can take it
I don't need it back
I gave you yesterday
Tomorrow's no concern
I gave you yesterday
I don't need it
Because today is mine

All we've got is the now
I want to bring you along
So many years, so many stuck behind
But we can right what's wrong
And there is only one life
We can get what it's worth
We see who holds the knife
When it's put in our back
We must endure

I gave you yesterday
I don't want it back
I gave you yesterday
You can keep it
Because today is mine

I gave you yesterday
Tomorrow's no concern
I gave you yesterday
You can take it
I don't need it back
I gave you yesterday
Tomorrow's no concern
I gave you yesterday
I don't need it
Because today is mine

Grateful to be here
We know we could be much worse
The song will live on
So we let the world hear our verse
It's a curse

I gave you yesterday
Tomorrow's no concern
I gave you yesterday
You can take it
I don't need it back
I gave you yesterday
Tomorrow's no concern
I gave you yesterday
I don't need it
Because today is mine
