While you read to me from the riot act way on high, high,
Clutching a crisp New Testament, breathing fire, fire.
Will you save me the fake benevolence, I don't have time, I'm,
Just too far gone for a-tellin', lost my pride, I don't mind.

Being lonely,
So leave me alone.
Aw, you're acting all holy,
Me, I'm just full of holes.

Well I can dip my head in the river,
Cleanse my soul, oh.
I'll still have the stomach of a sinner,
Face like an unholy ghost.
Will you save me all the soliloquies?
Paid my fines, I'll be,
Gone before my deliverance.
Preach what you write, cause I don't mind,

Being lonely,
So leave me alone.
You're acting all holy,
Me, I'm just full of holes.

Full of holes.

Don't mind being lonely,
Spare me the brimstone.
Acting all holy,
When you know I'm full of holes.

Don't mind being lonely,
Don't need to be told.
Stop acting so holy,
I know I'm full of holes.

Full of holes.

I don't mind being lonely,
Won't you leave me alone?
Are you, oh, so holy,
That I'll never be good enough?

Don't care if I'm lonely,
Cause it feels like home.
I won't ever be holy,
Thank God I'm full of holes.

Full of holes.
