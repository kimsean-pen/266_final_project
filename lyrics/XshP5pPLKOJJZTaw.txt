It's the way you're nervous when you speak
And the way I know just what you mean
It's the kind of things that's bittersweet
It's a funny feeling deep inside
So many different sides
But still so easy to define
'Cause you'll know it every time
And not just in your mind
You can feel the butterflies
Sending chills down your spine

What is love?
But a kiss on a rainy day
A smile that won't go away
A safe place to run
What is love?
But a complicated truth
A bond between me and you
The number one

(Oh, that's love)
And the things that never cross your mind
Now you're doing all the time
'Cause with someone special, it's so right
It's like dancing when you walk
And singing when you talk
And you're happy just to be alive
Live in the moment, don't pretend
Let it go and take it in
You don't have to understand
The how, why, and whens

What is love?
But a kiss on a rainy day
A smile that won't go away
A safe place to run
What is love?
But a complicated simple truth
A bond between me and you
The number one

So take off your hat and stay for a minute
Love is a precious thing
If you let it in
You'll never know what you'll find till you give it some time
Some time

What is love? (Oh yeah)
But a kiss on a rainy day (A kiss on a rainy day)
A smile that won't go away (A smile that won't go away)
A safe place to run
What is love? (What is love?)
But a complicated simple truth (A simple truth)
A bond between me and you (Between me and you)
The number one

What is love? (What is love?)
But a kiss on a rainy day (Ba, ba, ba, ba...)
A smile that won't go away
A safe place to run (A safe place to run)
What is love? (What is love?)
But a complicated simple truth (Ba, ba, ba, ba...)
A bond between me and you (Between me and you)
The number one (The number one)

(Oh, that's love)
Oh, that's love
What is love?
It's a kiss on a rainy day
What is love?
Uh, ha
