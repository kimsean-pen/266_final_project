みんあ！
くるま わ まんたん だし
すーつけーす に わ ばくだん つめてーいる
じんせい わ みじかくて、 いく みち わ きけん が おーおい
だから おどろう！

Alright, alright!

Everybody pay attention to me
I got the answer
I got the answer, yeah
Street walkin' cheetah with a capital "G"
So get your hands up
Now get your hands up

Hide your eyes, we're goin' to shine tonight
Subatomic never get the best of me
Ain't a DJ goin' to save my soul (my soul)
I sold it long ago for rock 'n' roll (whoa, oh)
Drop the needle when the tape deck blows
I got to shout this out, so everybody knows

This ain't a party, get off the dance floor
You want the get down, here comes the gang war
You're doin' alright, I got the answer
'Cause all the good times, they give you cancer

If we were all like you in the end
Oh, we'd be killin' ourselves by sleepin' in
So hit the lights, I'll do it again
And keep your cars, and your dogs
And your famous friends well, alright

Slide up the faders when the cabinet slams
And get your hands up
Now get your hands up
Light up the stage and watch me kick out the jams
So throw your fist up
Now throw your fist up

Ain't nobody goin' to take my life
Ain't nobody goin' to get the best of me
Ain't a preacher goin' to save me now
Grab a seat, I'm goin' to show you how
Everybody hit the pyro cue
We're goin' to blow this off, and show you what we do

This ain't a party, get off the dance floor
You want the get down, here comes the gang war
You're doin' alright, I got the answer
'Cause all the good times, they give you cancer

If we were all like you in the end
Oh, we'd be killin' ourselves by sleepin' in
So hit the lights, I'll do it again
And keep your cars, and your dogs
And your famous friends well, alright
Well, alright
Well, alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, alright

We came to party, kill the party tonight
We came to party, kill the party tonight
Let's go!

ゆうめい に なりたい の？
まじ で？
えいえん と いきたい
わたし わ ばくはつ する！

This ain't a party, get off the dance floor
You want the get down, here comes the gang war
You're doin' alright, I got the answer
'Cause all the good times
Give me, give me good times, people, tonight

This ain't a party, get off the dance floor
You want to get down, here comes the encore

If we were all like you in the end
Oh, we'd be killin' ourselves by sleepin' in
So hit the lights, I'll do it again

So everybody get down
(みんなと踊る)
'Til the party breaks down
(からだ が いたく なる まで)
Now everybody get down
(みんなと踊る)
Now everybody get down
'Til the party breaks down
(からだ が いたく なる まで)
Tonight
