Unsettled unfazed today
By the things I hear you saying
A bottle broken
So soft spoken
When you can't keep drinking
But you won't go home
Cuz' you know what's coming up
If you're sitting drunk at home alone
Cuz' we're all so helpless when we're on our own
So on and on and on we go

Fuck being sad
I'm so over it
Fuck having my head three feet in the sand

You're not lost
Don't be scared
You've gotta start building on the hope you spared
Trust me I know you'll get through it
I've done it before it's just in your head

Fuck being sad
I'm so over it
Fuck having my head three feet in the sand

Let go of what you took
Your hands are tied back
Forget how it looks
To be despondent

Fuck being sad
I'm so over it
Fuck having my head three feet in the sand
