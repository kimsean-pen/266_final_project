We'll know just what we'll find
Just this time
Saw you staring at the light
Just let go

And don't rush out of the room
She says it changes the mood
Don't rush out of the room
She says it changes the mood

Crushin
Sink in to something
I'm falling

Hold my hand this time
Just this time
I'll believe in what we'll find
Just you and I

She says don't tell me the truth
She says it spoils the mood
He says don't tell me the truth
He says it spoils the mood

Crushin
Sink in to something
I'm falling
Defeating
Believing in something
I'm falling see less
