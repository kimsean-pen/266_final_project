Woke up late today
And I still felt the sting of the pain
But I brushed my teeth anyway
Got dressed through the mess
And put a smile on my face
I got a little bit stronger

Riding in the car to work
And I'm trying to ignore the hurt
So I turned on the radio
Stupid song made me think of you
I listened to it for a minute
But then I changed it
And I'm getting a little bit stronger
Just a little bit stronger

I'm done hoping that we can work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
And letting you drag my heart around
And I'm done thinking you could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger
I get a little bit stronger

It doesn't happen overnight
Then you turn around and months gone by
And you realize you haven't cried
I'm not giving you an hour, or a second, or another minute longer
I'm busy getting stronger

I'm done hoping that we can work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
And letting you drag my heart around
And I'm done thinking that you could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger
Just a little bit stronger

Getting along without you, baby
I'm better off without you, baby
How does it feel without me, baby?
I'm getting stronger without you, baby

I'm done hoping that we can work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
And letting you drag my heart around
And I'm done thinking that you could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger
Just a little bit stronger

I get a little bit stronger
Just a little bit stronger
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit stronger

A little bit stronger
