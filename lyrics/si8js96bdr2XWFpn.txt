Seeing faces in the crowd getting caught in that homely feeling
Always trying to keep my mind far
away from what the psycho killers sayin
Trying to make it through the night
getting caught in that homely feeling
Keep my eyes wide awake can't let you catch me sleeping

I know I'm not the one
But they follow me with guns
I know I'm not the one

Say
Say I'm not the one no say it can't be done
Say
Say I'm not the one I know you're having fun

Seeing faces in the crowd getting caught in that homely feeling
Always trying to keep my mind far
away from what the psycho killers saying
Trying to make it through the night
cold sweat and my hands are shaking
Keep my eyes wide awake can't let you catch me sleeping

I know I'm not the one
But they follow me with guns
I know I'm not the one

Say
Say I'm not the one no say it can't be done
Say
Say I'm not the one I know you're having fun
