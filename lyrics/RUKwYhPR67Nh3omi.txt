The night is restless
But no dream's in sight
And the sounds have no beginnings or ends
And that glow is not a light

The walls turn into waterfalls
With water made of thoughts that call

It's not okay to tip the glass
Don't smile too long or shed a tear
You're not the only one to know
Things have changed, now we are here

We are not the king and queen
What we are lies in between
The blankets that you've never seen
But over you are spread

'We are here', the voices sing
We are here, the echo thunders
Here we are, the doorbell rings
We are here and here in numbers

Others came in from the hall
Thoughts with voices start to call

It's not okay to tip the glass
Don't smile too long or shed a tear
You're not alone the way you thought
Things have changed, now we are here
