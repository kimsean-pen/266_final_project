Tweed jacket, trucker hat, cup of tea
I'm just sitting at the table thinking about me
With my moccasins on and waiting by my phone
With my half-masked eyes like a tear-less drone
I am the deep down clown
You better throw me a bone
Cause I'll be making that sound
When they leave me alone
With the pots and pans
My voice and my hands
And my spoon drumstick
With this innocuous trance
You got to give me a chance
To advance
This romance
So when I pick out my 'fro
I have a place I can go
No no dont leave me hanging like a spider with no fly
Cause I've been banging on the walls
Cause I'm too dry to cry
No no dont leave me hanging like a spider with no fly
Cause I've been banging on the walls
Cause I'm too dry to cry
Photocopied Xerox pictures of dames
With two dimensional faces make me feel ashamed
So I keep 'em tucked away
In a folder that's red
But I don't need to look at them
Cause they're stuck in my head
They're what I sniff
When I tell you
To come right along
In my one-room shack
You know we can't go wrong
I got nine hard inches
Like a pitchfork prong
So honey lift up your dress
And help me sing this song
No no dont leave me hanging like a spider with no fly
Cause I've been banging on the walls
Cause I'm too dry to cry
No no dont leave me hanging like a spider with no fly
Cause I've been banging on the walls
Cause I'm too dry to cry
No no dont leave me hanging like a spider with no fly
Cause I've been banging on the walls
Cause I'm too dry to cry
No no dont leave me hanging like a spider with no fly
Cause I've been banging on the walls
Cause Im too dry to cry
No no
Ow no
Dont need me hanging
Dont need me hanging
Dont need me hanging
Dont need me hanging
