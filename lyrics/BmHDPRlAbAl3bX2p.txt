Won't you turn around and please look at me?
For everything we are, everything we've been
I promise I'll be good if you stay with me

But everything we are it just went away
With the slide of a tongue and a sour taste
I can not recall, I can explain

But I remember the nights when you'd lie with me
Where we'd talk and we'd touch and we'd fall asleep
I wake up in your arms and I feel at ease
It's gonna be a long night

I still have your shirt in my dresser drawer
The one with the stripes that you liked in store
Oh everything has changed, I wanted more

Oh how it's raining
Oh how the water falls
Into the safe things
We try to set in stone
I can't replace you
I can't escape you, now

But I remember the nights when you'd lie with me
Where we'd talk and we'd touch and we'd fall asleep
I wake up in your arms and I feel at ease

But now it's just me and I lie awake
And I toss and I turn and I see your face
When I wake from a dream it won't go away

Oh it's gonna be a long night

But I remember the nights when you'd lie with me
Where we'd talk and we'd touch and we'd fall asleep
I wake up in your arms and I feel at ease

But now it's just me and I lie awake
And I toss and I turn and I see your face
When I wake from a dream it won't go away

Oh it's gonna be a long night
