I listened to the cure
And then I cried
I watched Videodrome
And lost my mind
I tried to write a song
I think you'd like
But no one gives a shit
About my life
Until I die
Its DIY

I have nightmares
All the time
So I stay awake
All night
I say I'm gonna leave
But I think you're right
I'm gonna stay right here
Until I die
Its DIY
