My make-up is my armour
My dress is like the paramour
You wonna be my mover
And I want to feel you more and more

My make-up is my armour
My dress is like the paramour
You wonna be my lover
Don't you realise it's insecure?

Would you fight for it?
Would you prove that you love me?
I don't need any illusions
I need a conclusion that you'll fight for it

My music is my owner
My bit is complicated code
You're coming from the Nowhere
But you got into my deepest thought

My music is my owner
My bit is complicated code
The only thing I wonder
Are you ready to be overloaded?
