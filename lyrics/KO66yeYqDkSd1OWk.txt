I need a kick drum
A guitar now
And a bass line
And I'ma show you how
How to rock
How to dance
How to get down
All I need is a piano in my track now

Throw your hands, throw your hands
Throw your hands, throw your hands up
Whoa, whoa
'Cause, you can't, 'cause, you can't
'Cause, you can't, cause, you can't stop
Whoa, whoa

Can you hear me? (hey)
Do you feel it? (hey)
If you're with me go (1, 2, 3)
'Cause, we're here and we're now
And we're all together
So, let's make this last forever

Turn the amps up
Turn the lights down (down)
Br-br-br, br-brush yourself off (off, off, off, off)
I'ma show you how
How to rock
How to dance
How to get down
Everybody on the floor now

Throw your hands, throw your hands
Throw your hands, throw your hands up
Whoa, whoa
'Cause, you can't, 'cause, you can't
'Cause, you can't, 'cause, you can't stop
Whoa, whoa

Can you hear me? (hey)
Do you feel it? (hey)
If you're with me go (1, 2, 3)
'Cause, we're here and we're now
And we're all together
So, let's make this last forever

Let's make this last forever
Let's make this last forever
Let's make this last forever

Of all the stars in the sky tonight
Compared to us, well they don't shine quite as bright

Throw your hands, throw your hands
Throw your hands, throw your hands up
Whoa, whoa
'Cause, you can't, 'cause, you can't
'Cause, you can't, 'cause, you can't stop
Whoa, whoa

Can you hear me? (hey)
Do you feel it? (hey)
If you're with me go (1, 2, 3)
'Cause, we're here and we're now
And we're all together
So, let's make this last forever

Throw your hands, throw your hands
Throw your hands, throw your hands up (hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up)
Whoa, whoa
'Cause, you can't, 'cause, you can't
'Cause, you can't, 'cause, you can't stop
Whoa, whoa (can't stop, can't stop, can't stop)

Can you hear me? (hey)
Do you feel it? (hey)
If you're with me go (1, 2, 3)
'Cause, we're here and we're now
And we're all together
So, let's make this last forever

Let's make this last forever
Let's make this last forever
Let's make this last forever
Let's make this last forever
Let's make this last forever (1, 2, 3)

'Cause, we're here and we're now
And we're all together
So, let's make this last forever
