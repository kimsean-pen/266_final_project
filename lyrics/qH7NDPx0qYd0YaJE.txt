I'm in my 20s
So I'm panicking every way
I'm so scared of the future
I keep missing today
How did you do it?
How did it turn out alright?
I swear it's always easier back then
Or is it just hindsight?

They keep telling me
You've got your whole life ahead of you, baby
Don't worry, don't stress, do your best
What if that doesn't save me?
They say, if I could go back and do it again
I would've wasted all my money
Would've slept with all my friends but you didn't
'Cause you had your whole life ahead of you, baby

I don't dare shut my eyes
I don't wanna miss a thing
I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna disappoint me
I won't stop looking at others
Thinking that's where I should be
I'm trying to enjoy myself, love myself
Who the fuck is myself?

But they keep telling me
You've got your whole life ahead of you, baby
Don't worry, don't stress, do your best
What if that doesn't save me?
They say, if I could go back, if I was still young
I would've cared less, made more mistakes to learn from
But you didn't 'cause you had your whole life ahead of you, baby

How did you make it work out?
Don't tell me you faked it
Should I be changing it now or am I too late?
Could just be me or maybe our generation
Still they say be patient, it's all meant to be
You've got your whole life ahead of you, baby
You've got your whole life ahead of you, baby

They say, if I could go back and do it again
I would've wasted all my money
Would've slept with all my friends but you didn't
'Cause you had your whole life ahead of you, baby

They say, if I could go back and do it again, do it again
They say, if I could go back and do it again
