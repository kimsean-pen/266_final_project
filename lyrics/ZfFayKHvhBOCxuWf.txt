I said you ain't found nothing like the rath of the woman that you pushed too far,
you cant run and you cant hide she's gonna find just where you are,
said I wasn't trying to hurt nobody was just trying to have my fun,
i went for the crown and then it all came down had true love now i got none,
oh no no no oh
yeah yeah yeah oh
no no no oh
yeah yeah yeah

Because Im lovesick and there ain't no cure
cause I keep on coming back for more,
oh no no no
I'm lovesick guess I got the blues
doctor help I don't know what to do, oh no no no
(had true love now i have none cause I'm lovesick)

Ain't found nothing so cold as the shoulder of a woman thats mad,
grew up in the notebook and i never had it quite this bad,
when you finally get her attention, you better hold onto your hat,
cause i never felt the temperature heat up quite that when she looked at me like that,
oh no no no
oh yeah yeah yeah
oh no no no
oh yeah yeah yeah

Because Im lovesick and there ain't no cure
cause I keep on coming back for more,
oh no no no
I'm lovesick guess I got the blues
doctor help I don't know what to do, oh no no no
(had true love now i have none cause I'm lovesick)

And I never been a perfect angel but
I try to do the best i can,
sometimes i might just make mistakes and I got a bottle in my hand,
so when she went through my phone in the morning, judging by the texts she read,
she said boy by the time I'm done with you,
you'd be better off dead,
oh no no no,
oh no no no
oh yeah yeah yeah,
oh no no no
oh yeah yeah yeah,

Because Im lovesick and there ain't no cure
cause I keep on coming back for more,
oh no no no
I'm lovesick guess I got the blues
doctor help I don't know what to do, oh no no no

Because Im lovesick and there ain't no cure
cause i keep on coming back for more,
oh no no no,
Im lovesick guess I got the blues
doctor help I don't know what to do, oh no no no
(had true love now i have none cause I'm lovesick)
