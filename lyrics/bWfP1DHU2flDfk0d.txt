Story starts, quiet town
Small town boy, big time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way

The streets are red, red I'm afraid
There's no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But oh my God, how it all did change
Now they all pray
Blood stain wash away

He said, lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way
I heard him

He said, lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

I always said, something wrong
With little strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
He talked alone, for miles and miles and miles...

Gallow calls, son I say
Keep your smile, and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys, how they soon change
Now they all pray
Blood stains wash away

He said, lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way
Yeah, I heard him

He said, lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today
Yeah

Yeah, well all the green things died
When Ronnie moved to this place
He said, don't you dare ask
Why I'm cursed to wear this face

Now we all know why
Children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket
And they'd all fall down, down, down

He said, lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way
Yeah, yeah, I heard him

He screamed, lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

That's right
All things wash away
And they'd all fall down
But blood stained the sun today

Yeah, yeah
All things wash away
And they'd all fall down
But blood stained the sun today
