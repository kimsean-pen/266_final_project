Now I'm here, can you see me?
'Cos I'm out on my own
When the room goes cold, tell me
You can feel me

...'Cos I'm here
Here I am, can you see me
Passing through, on my way
To a place I'd been to only in my

In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
'Cause you can count your

Real true friends on one hand
...through life
There are those that deceive you
There are those that'll let you down

Is there someone out there that would
Die for you
...thought not
Live your life with a passion

Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
...so they say
In a world of confusion

People never say what they mean
If you want a straight answer
Go look for one
...right now

In a room full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall?
Do you sometime feel like you're
On the outside
...looking in?
You can make your own luck
You create your own destiny
I believe you have the power
If you want to
...it's true
