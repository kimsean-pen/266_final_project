It's wearing on my mind, I'm speaking all my doubts aloud
You rob a dead mans grave, then flaunt it like you did create
If I hit bottom and everythings gone in the great Mississippi
Please, drown me and run
It's digging time again, you're nurturing the weakest trend
Those with the heart and the brain to get past this
Can spot a pathetic without even asking
Fuck your magazine, and fuck the long dead plastic scene
Pierce a new hole, if Hell was "in" you'd give your soul

The great southern trendkill
That's right
The great southern trendkill
Fuck you

Buy it at a store, from MTV to on the floor
You look just like a star, it's proof you don't know who you are
If I hit bottom and everythings gone in the great Mississippi
Please, drown me and run
It's bullshit time again, you'll save the world within your trend
Those with the heart and the brain to get past this
Can spot a pathetic without even asking
Politically relieved, you're product sold and well received
The right words spoken gold, if I was God you'd sell your soul

The great southern trendkill
That's right
The great southern trendkill
Fuck you
