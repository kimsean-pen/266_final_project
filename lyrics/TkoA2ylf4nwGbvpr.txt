All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watching the puddles gather rain
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view
But it's not sane
It's not sane

I just want someone to say to me, oh oh oh oh
I'll always be there when you wake, yeah yeah
Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today, hey
So stay with me and I'll have it made

And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain that there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape
Escape, escape, escape

All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
You don't like my point of view and I'm insane
It's not sane, it's not sane

I just want someone to say to me, oh oh oh oh
I'll always be there when you wake, yeah yeah
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today, hey
So stay with me and I'll have it made

I'll have it made
And I'll have it made
Oh no no
You know we're really gonna, really gonna have it made
Gonna have it made
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
