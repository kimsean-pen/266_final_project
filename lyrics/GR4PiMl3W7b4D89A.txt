A subway cries out, "somewhere there's
a place for us", my belle, my baby
A fantasy about your dreams
By train arrives to overwhelm you

Done tearing out my hair
I wanna tear you up
Done running from the sun
I'm gonna run you down
And I'll never ask again
This is a violent game
I'll never ask again

Relentlessness could get you off
I'll find you wether lost or hidden
When fantasies about your dreams
Succumb to anything forbidden

Done wearing out my head
I wanna wear you out
Done breaking like a shell
I'm gonna break you in
And I'll never ask again
This is a violent game
I'll never ask again

Oh how can my love be so slow
And so swift to hurt you?
Oh how can your love be so strong
And swiftly dessert you?

Compare me to bygone bouquets
I'll triumph any phantom vampire
Like scumbags in the light of day
I'll trample them like forrest wildfires

Done fainting in stairways
I'm gonna paint your face
Done asking for a shot
I'm gonna shoot you down
And I'll never ask again
This is a violent game
I'll never ask again
This is a violent game
I'm changing my statement
This is a violent game
I'm changing my statement
This is a violent game
I'm changing my statement
This is a violent game
I'm changing my statement
