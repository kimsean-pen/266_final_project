A deer in the headlights
Me in my love life
Zig-zagging left right
Wonder why I never
Wanna go home
All alone

Love, it ain't easy
And lust ain't no Nietzsche
Papa, don't preach me
You oughta know
That it's hard to find gold
In this crap disco

Well, you fell right into my arms
And fit into my puzzle
So we made love in a quickly
Parked European car
Couldn't read all the fine print
What's written in the stars
I don't care as long as you are

Whoo (funky at heart)
Whoo (funky at heart)

Weeks on without rent
At your apartment
Though it's not convent
I find peace of mind
For the very first time
(for the very first time)
In my life

We follow our instinct
Go to the ice rink
Couples with hot drinks
Welcome us like we
Are one of them now
Guess it shows

Well, you fell right into my arms
And fit into my puzzle
So we made love in a quickly
Parked European car
Couldn't read all the fine print
What's written in the stars
I don't care as long as you are

Whoo (funky, funky at heart)
Whoo (funky, funky at heart)

Well, you fell right into my arms
And fit into my puzzle
So we made love in a quickly
Parked European car
