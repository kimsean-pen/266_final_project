Babe, you're taking your time in every way
If you feel the same, love, why would we wait?
There's words I can't say, but my love's not simple
I'm fragile and you don't even know
No, you don't even know

I want it all
I've got this lovesick feeling
But there's nothing like it, nothing at all
I know your heart's still beating
And I want it all, I want it all
Or nothing at all

Babe, we push and we pull
We give and we take
We've got a lifetime to kill
A second to waste
Oh, what a shame, but my love's not simple
It's fragile and you don't even know
No, you don't know the half of it

I want it all
I've got this lovesick feeling
But there's nothing like it, nothing at all
I know your heart's still beating
And I want it all, I want it all
Or nothing at all

So make up your mind
Quit wasting your time
I'm losing my mind (mind, mind)

And I want it all
I want it all
Or nothing at all

I've got this lovesick feeling
But there's nothing like it, nothing at all
I know your heart's still beating
And I want it all, I want it all
Or nothing at all
Or nothing at all
