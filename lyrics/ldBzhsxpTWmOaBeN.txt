I, I wasn't even searching for love
That's usually right when it creeps up on you
And I know, in my heart it's true

Oh yeah?

Boy you got my attention, what's up?
My heart is beating
Your screaming got me open so much
I think I'm dreaming

Got my hands way up
I surrender to love

What a feeling
To let it all go
What a feeling
I'm losing control
What a feeling
Feels like I'm on top of the world

I used to think I'd never fall in love

It's like my favorite star
I used to stare at every night
Came down from the sky

Oh yeah?

When I love the way you touch
My heart is beating
Boy I just can't get enough
You got my speechless

Got my hands way up
I surrender to love

What a feeling
To let it all go
What a feeling
I'm losing control
What a feeling
Feels like I'm on top of the world
