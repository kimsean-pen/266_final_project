Yeah, every time I'm here, I rep for you
I represent for you, yeah?
'Cause if it weren't for you I couldn't be doing what I do
Man loves you, still, and I'm not even feeling no way to say that
Obviously man's a G, but I still show love to my G's, innit
'Cause you helped man live, innit
You help man do my ting, so I love that, get me?

Na, this one's emotional man
You know how it is, like, you wanna try and keep a straight face, yeah
But certain times the pain just makes man's chest too hard
And you just gotta, like, you just gotta speak 'cause it's real, innit
You just gotta say what you feel
Like, this is one of them tunes

You know them ones that you just call up your ex
And you're like, "Yo, babes, like,"
"I know man fucked up, but I didn't even mean to"
"Like, certain times man just moves a bit of a funny way"
You know them ones?
