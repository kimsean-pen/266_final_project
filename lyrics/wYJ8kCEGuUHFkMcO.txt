Your six blade knife - do anything for you
Anything you want it to
One blade - breaking my heart
One blade - tearing me apart
Your six blade knife - do anything for you

You take away my mind like you take away the top of a tin
Come up from behind and lay it down cold on my skin
Took a stone from my soul when I was lame
Just so you could make me tame yes
You take away my mind like you take away the top of a tin

I wanna be free of that thing - I don't want it no more
I'd like to be free of it now - mm I don't want it no more

Everybody got a knife it can be just what you want it to be
A needle a wife or something that you just can't see

Six blade knife keep you strong
Yes and it'll do me wrong
Your six blade knife - do anything for you
Do anything - anything
Anything
