Oh, what a shame that your pockets did bleed on St. Valentine's
And you sat in a chair thinking, "Boy, I'm such a prince"
Well, life's a train that goes from February on day by day
But it's making a stop on April first

And you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
But just until the fish start to smell
And you're struck down by a hammer

Sure, you were swift when the handsome Greek boys dropped by with gifts
You are suave thanks to ribbons that opened sesame
But in the stars and closer to home in every planet
It ain't hard for me and dear JoJo to see

That you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
But just until the fish start to smell
And you're struck down by a hammer

So let it all go by
Looking at the sky
Wondering if there's clouds and stuff in hell

Let it all go by (Looking at the sky)
Looking at the sky (Wondering if there's clouds and stuff in hell)
Wondering if there are clouds in hell

And you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
Yes, you will believe in love

Girl, you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
Yes, you will believe in love

But you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
Yes, you will believe in love

And you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
Yes, you will believe in love
