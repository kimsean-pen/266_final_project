so you come dripping from the hive
glittering as you arrive
high half as long and twice as bright
see you burning from both sides (from both sides) [x2]

you come slipping down the slide
dragging me by your side
phony colors in your eyes
soul's obscene but I don't mind (I don't mind)
you're so obscene but I don't mind (don't mind)
yea yea yea yea yea yea

you come whipping [ripping?] through my life
flipping out like some old wife
your syringe mouth is open wide
you go insane I go inside
