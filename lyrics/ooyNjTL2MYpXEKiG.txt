He knew what he wanted to say
But he did not want to word it
The dirty little Herbert was thinkin' an escape
But the place was well-guarded
The guiltiness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

D is for delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare

D is for desperately tryin' to stimulate
What it was that was alright three quarters of an hour ago
That had led him to be in a position and every compromission
Another freak episode

He's nearin' the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearin' the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearin' the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearin' the brink but he thinks first
The parallel,
I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare

D is for delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
You should know you're his favourite worst nightmare
