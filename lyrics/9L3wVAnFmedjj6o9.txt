Nothing that has happened so far
Has been anything we could control.
I have just been waiting for the perfect
Time to tell you I don't know.

Maybe I'm just reading into it a
Little deeper than I should.
We would make it easy we would take
It slowly if only we could.

Melody

Look at me
Unless you're trying to hurt me
Heavy blow
Down I go
Now I just want to let go.
Is it right?

Is it wrong?
I don't know

It's not the cause I'm fighting for
Anymore
But it sucks to keep on running.
Eventually
There will be
A time for clearer thinking
For now I weep
Can't get to sleep
I try to hold a good feeling.
I just get one
Here it comes
There it goes
And we just might
Lose the fight, yeah
But it's alright
It wasn't our decision.

Nothing that has happened so far
Has been anything we could control.
I have just been waiting for the perfect
Time to tell you that I know
Every man is happy until
Happiness is suddenly a goal.
I'll just be here waiting till the
Doctor calls and then I'll let you know.
