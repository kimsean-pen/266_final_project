Thought I saw an opening
Thought that I was closing in
So I started hoping then
And even though I had a doubt
Thought that we could work it out
All I ever thought about

No fun when you're the only one
Love drunk when the others sober
No moon when the day has gone
No sun when the night is over

And I wish it were
A little more easy (easy)
But you're hard to get
When all you do is tease me
Cause I'll never know
Exactly how you see me (see me)
But I wish you well
And goodbye is never easy
(Easy)

If I could do it all again
Would I do it all again
Or would I do it different
Or maybe in another life
You and I can get it right
Or would I be alone at night

No fun when you're the only one
Love drunk when the others sober
No moon when the day has gone
No sun when the night is over

And I wish it were
A little more easy (easy)
But you're hard to get
When all you do is tease me
Cause I'll never know
Exactly how you see me (see me)
But I wish you well
And goodbye is never easy

Love drunk when the others sober

And I wish it were
A little more easy (easy)
But you're hard to get
When all you do is tease me
Cause I'll never know
Exactly how you see me (see me)
But I wish you well
And goodbye is never easy, oh
Oh I wish you well (easy)
But you know goodbye is never easy
