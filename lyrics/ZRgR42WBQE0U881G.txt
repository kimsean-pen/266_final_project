I've been locked in the locker
I was picked last in soccer
And they say that it's all fun
But their fun, it ain't fun, man I'm done

And I know we're all different
Our beliefs and religions
But I don't see the difference
In me, you, your, tu or moi, vous
So if you've had enough, then

Come to the land of the lost and lonely
Don't be afraid, we'll be one big family
Of Freaks, like you and me
I know a place where the bruised and broken
Live like the kings and the queens of tragedy
Just Freaks, like you and me
We are the Freaks

I've been kicked down in the dirt
I pretend that it don't hurt
And I know that they're just words
But sticks, stones, they break bones but just know

We could all be disciples
And we'll write our own Bible
We'll put freaks in the titles
It's me, you, your, tu and moi, vous
So if you've had enough, then

Come to the land of the lost and lonely
Don't be afraid, we'll be one big family
Of Freaks, like you and me
I know a place where the bruised and broken
Live like the kings and the queens of tragedy
Just Freaks, like you and me
We are the Freaks

We are the Freaks
Na-na-na, na-na-na
We are the Freaks

Come to the land of the lost and lonely
Don't be afraid, we'll be one big family
Of Freaks, like you and me
I know a place where the bruised and broken
Live like the kings and the queens of tragedy
Just Freaks, like you and me

Come home
Where you can be you, I can be me
We'll never leave
'Cause we are the Freaks
Come home
Where you can be you, I can be me
We'll never leave
'Cause we are the Freaks
We are the Freaks
