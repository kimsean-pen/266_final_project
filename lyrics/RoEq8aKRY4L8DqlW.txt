Here comes the action
Here it comes at last
Lord, give me a reaction
Lord, give me a chance

You should follow me down
In satellite towns
There's no color and no sound
I'll be ten feet underground
Gotta get out of this satellite town

Here comes some action
First time in my life
Gotta get out to get compensation
Gotta get out to get this to last

Whether you live alone
Or you're trying to find your way in this world
You better make sure that you don't
Crack you head on that pavement, man
My God, the shock
It's been preying on me and mine
This is a dangerous place, man
This is a dangerous place, there's nothing here

You should follow your way down
In satellite towns
There's no color and no sound
I'll be ten feet underground
In a black and white town

You should follow me down
There's no color and no sound
In a black and white town
I'll be ten feet underground
In a black and white town
