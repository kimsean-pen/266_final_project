First off she's a lady
And this is a lady's world
Man she drives them crazy
Dancing like a chiki girl

All eyes - on Μαρία
No lie - she's the bomb
Oh my - they all wanna see her,
All wanna be the lucky one

Shake it up, shake it up
There you go - oh ohh
Γειά σου Μαρία
Turn around, bring it down
Go slow - heads up
Lord have mercy

Shake it up, shake it up
There you go - oh ohh
Γειά σου Μαρία
Ai, ai, ai, there she goes
Μαρία!
Γειά σου Μαρία

Moves like aphrodite
So high above the rest
Smooth like cleopatra
An angel in a devil's dress

Her hips - lust in motion
Her lips - red like wine
She is - the heart of attention, probably should mention
She's mine...

Shake it up, shake it up
There you go - oh ohh
Γειά σου Μαρία
Turn around, bring it down

Go slow - heads up
Lord have mercy
Shake it up, shake it up
There you go - oh ohh
Γειά σου Μαρία
Ai ai ai there she goes
Μαρία!

Shake it up, shake it up
There you go - oh ohh
Γειά σου Μαρία
Turn around, bring it down
Go slow - heads up
Lord have mercy

Shake it up, shake it up
There you go - oh ohh
Γειά σου Μαρία
Ai ai ai there she goes
Μαρία!
