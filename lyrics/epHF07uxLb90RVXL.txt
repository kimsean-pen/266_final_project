Sometimes overthinking can feel like more than overthinking
It's like I'm trapped in spaceland and I'm not coming back

Sometimes when I'm floating it feels like my head's overflowing
And it's not too difficult to detach, but it's hard to come back

I'm losing touch, I'm not enough
I'm losing touch, I'm not enough for them

The ceiling's spinning and I think god is winning
'Cause I see my hands shaking and I cannot make them stop

Fish swim so quickly, I feel so fucking guilty
And I miss all of my friends
Please, where did they go?

I'm losing touch, I'm not enough
I'm losing touch, I'm not enough for them
