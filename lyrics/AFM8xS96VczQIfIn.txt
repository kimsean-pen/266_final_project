Hey, you,
I like the way you move your body on the floor.
Tell me, are you coming over?
Don't stand there, get over here, get closer now.

Have you got what it takes to win me over
And take me to the precious song,
Yeah, can we take it lower?
Don't stand there, show me what the love is.

Do it to my favorite song, do it to me all night long,
Give me love and dance the night away.
Every moment yours to be, feeling fine, we're into deep,
Nothing can stop us, baby, show me the way.

Take my hand and lead me,
Let's do what lovers do.
Make me see what you see,
It's all I ask from you.
I want you, you want me,
Let's make it last forever.
Fill in a kiss, show me what love is.

Baby, it's time for us to turn around and feel the sound
Vibrating in our hearts, baby.
I'm right here, show me what the love is.

Do it to my favorite song, do it to me all night long,
Give me love and dance the night away.
Every moment yours to be, feeling fine, we're into deep,
Nothing can stop us, baby, show me the way.

Take my hand and lead me,
Let's do what lovers do.
Make me see what you see,
It's all I ask from you.
I want you, you want me,
Let's make it last forever.
Fill in a kiss, show me what love is.

In the heat of the night, all I think of is you, baby
It's driving me crazy.
And I'll be losing my mind if I don't take a chance on you,
Chance on you, baby.

Give me your love,
If that is what you want from my world.
Give me your love,
I will give you what I got, girl,
Give you what I got, girl.

Take my hand and lead me,
Let's do what lovers do.
Make me see what you see,
It's all I ask from you.
I want you, you want me,
Let's make it last forever.
Fill in a kiss, show me what love is.

Take my hand and lead me,
Let's do what lovers do.
Make me see what you see,
It's all I ask from you.
I want you, you want me,
Let's make it last forever.
Fill in a kiss, show me what love is.

Do it to my favorite song, do it to me all night long,
Give me love and dance the night away.
