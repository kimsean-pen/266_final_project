Don't cry over me
Don't cry over me
Don't cry over me
I know it's a dark cave and even though it's far from heaven
Maybe this could be my haven
I know it's a dark cave and even though it's far from heaven
Maybe this could be my heaven
Don't cry over me
Don't cry over me
Don't cry over me
Don't cry over me
I know it's a dark cave and even though it's far from heaven
Maybe this could be my heaven
I know it's a dark cave and even though it's far from heaven
Maybe this could be my heaven
Don't cry over me
Don't cry over me
I know it hurts you when I fucking shiver
Well, trust me I was such a strong believer
But what's the point of searching for that halo
My eyes are blinded and my heart is shallow
It's getting worse and worse as I think deeper
It's just like staring at a burning river
Well, now it's time stop Just pull the trigger
I want to end it all I wanted over
