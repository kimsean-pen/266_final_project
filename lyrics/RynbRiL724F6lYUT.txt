I don't believe in regrets.
What's done has been done,
The past is dead.

I cannot believe in regrets,
"If onlys" are useless.
Let it rest.

MORS ULTIMA RATIO...

Hey, little Persian boy,
What's all this talk about size?

Huh?!

I cannot read your mind,
Where are the polaroids?
That bush, it needs to go!

Now, listen... word of advice,
These are simple facts:
Your junk is merely that,
When your face looks like crap,
But first things first:

Are you uncut?

What?!?

The foreskin is the essence,
The essence of a man.
A man circumcised
Is a mutilated man.

Hey, hunky cholo fat-boy,
Well, aren't you next in line?

Yes!

We've heard it all before,
It's really such a bore,
But there's still one thing
You can do for me...

Now, I... I didn't make the rules,
These are the simple facts:
You're nicely tatted up,
That's not bad for a start.
But let me see:

Are you uncut?

The essence of a man is his foreskin.
A circumcised man... is a man... defiled.
