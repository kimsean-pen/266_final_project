Everest is only a mountain
A pyramid is just a shape
Doesn't have to hold you back
Doesn't have to pin you down.
Let your dreams take flight
And your heart ignite
Did you know that is true?
Everything is possible
It's nothing we can't do

It's a wild and beautiful fire
And I believe in you
I believe, I believe, I believe hey!
I believe, I believe, I believe hey!
And I believe in you

Don't be afraid to be who you are
Just scream out and shout
And follow the stars

Forget about the past, It is over
We are the young
Ones our way is forward
Who keeps tabs on stupid mistakes?
We all mess up
But that's just the way

We learn how to get back up
We learn how to turn the page
So, we will
Let our dreams take flight
And our hearts ignite
Did you know that is true?
Everything is possible
It's nothing we can't do
It's a wild and beautiful fire
And I believe in you
I believe, I believe, I believe hey!
I believe, I believe, I believe hey!
And I believe in you

Let your dreams take flight
And your heart ignite
Did you know that is true?
That everything is possible
It's nothing we can't do
It's a wild and beautiful fire
And I believe in you
I believe, I believe, I believe hey!
I believe, I believe, I believe hey!
And I believe in you
I believe, I believe, I believe hey!
I believe, I believe, I believe hey!
And I believe in you!
