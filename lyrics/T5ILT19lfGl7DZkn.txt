Let's fall apart together now

Zipping cupid in a body bag well-worn
Next to the mausoleum he was born in
Picking up the pieces of this gory glory of it all
from Eve to morn
for Eve to mourn

Have no fear
There are wounds that are not meant to heal
And they sing, in venere veritas
Come inside
Let the fire burn you alive
And sing, baby sing
There are wounds that are not meant to heal at all
In venere veritas

Let's fall apart together now

There's a method to our sadness
as we drag the mirror ball and chain
Through the twilight
Again dressed up in shame

Have no fear
There are wounds that are not meant to heal
And they sing, in venere veritas
Come inside
Let the fire burn you alive
And sing, baby sing
There are wounds that are not meant to heal at all
In venere veritas

We are begging for a reflection
from an unshutted heart to blind
and chase us over the edge

Have no fear
There are wounds that are not meant to heal
And they sing, in venere veritas
Come inside
Let the fire burn you alive
And sing, baby sing
There are wounds that are not meant to heal at all
In venere veritas
These are the wounds that are not meant to heal at all

Let's fall apart together now
Let's fall apart together now
