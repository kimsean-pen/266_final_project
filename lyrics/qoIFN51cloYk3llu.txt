Woke up this morning with the strangest feeling
I had a nightmare, but I wasn't dreaming
I ran outside to see, it's not 2003
Turned on the radio, it's so confusing
Rappers were singing and rockers DJ'ing
There's no guitars on the songs that they're playing
I called my shrink to see if I was healthy
I called my mom and she was taking selfies

Grew up on MTV
When they had Eazy-E
In California yeah
They still knew how to throw a party
When it was Gin & Juice
And we had Dre and Snoop
In California yeah
They still knew how to throw a party

Oh, oh oh
Last night I had a 40 ounce
Oh, oh oh
Last night I had a 40 ounce dream

Now all the punk rockers are over 40
They're coaching little league and reading stories
When did the neighborhood ever sound so good
Looked on the corner and there's no more junkies
More girls and more grunge and bottles and more fun
Needles and squatters pissed off at their fathers
I can't believe it man, it's all so boring
Went down to Gilman yeah the cops were snoring

Grew up on MTV
When they had Eazy-E
In California yeah
They still knew how to throw a party
When it was Gin & Juice
And we had Dre and Snoop
In California yeah
They still knew how to throw a party

Oh, oh oh
Last night I had a 40 ounce
Oh, oh oh
Last night I had a 40 ounce dream

Grew up on MTV

When it was Gin & Juice
And we had Dre and Snoop
In California yeah
They still knew how to throw a party

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We still know how to throw a party
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
