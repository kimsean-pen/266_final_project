Don't take your time
Don't take it easy on me
'Cause I'm running wild
Hot like a broken machine

Tell it like it is
Wash away my sins
Digging up the bones inside my head

All I needed was to hear the truth
I'm lying naked and my brain has lost its screws
I hid away inside a lonely room
Never as lonely as when I'm alone with you

I'm such a wreck
Toxic is tasting so sweet
Don't let me rest
Stuck in this static TV

Tell it like it is
Wash away my sins
Digging up the bones inside my head

All I needed was to hear the truth
I'm lying naked and my brain has lost its screws
I hid away inside a lonely room
Never as lonely as when I'm alone with you

Ah, alone with you, ah
Ah, alone with you, ah
My brain!
My brain!
My brain!
My brain!

All I needed was to hear the truth
I'm lying naked and my brain has lost its screws
I hid away inside a lonely room
Never as lonely as when I'm alone with you

Ah, alone with you, ah
Ah, alone with you, ah
(Alone, hey, alone)
Alone with you
