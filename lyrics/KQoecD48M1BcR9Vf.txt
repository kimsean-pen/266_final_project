We wandered led by the gods
You gave a voice
Uîdluiā of the Allobroges
Your feet danced
In the footprints of the Otherworld
The words of your songs
Carved into our hearts

My Vianna
My bright light
Vianna
My Sacrifice
My Vianna
My patroness
Vianna
My Immortal
Hallowed be Thy name, my child

Dancing in the Awen
You became the word
As tears mingled with the Rhodanos
And as the earth opened up
To receive its sacrifice
You blessed the fen
The consecrated ground
