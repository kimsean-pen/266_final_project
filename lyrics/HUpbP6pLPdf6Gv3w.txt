You used to slide down the carpeted stairs
or down the bannister
you stuttered like a kaleidoscope
'cause you knew too many words
you used to make ginger bread houses
we used to have taffy pulls

Take ecstasy with me, baby
take ecstasy with me.

You had a black snowmobile
we drove out under the northern lights
a vodka bottle gave you those raccoon eyes
we got beat up just for holding hands

Take ecstasy with me, baby
take ecstasy with me.
