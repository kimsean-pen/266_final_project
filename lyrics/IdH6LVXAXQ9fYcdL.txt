For so long
I've been searching for someone who could be
The one who really understands me
I've been searching for you so desperately
In the past
I've contemplated what went so fast
Seperated good from the bad
I never got what I should have had

Oh, gonna make you mine

All night
I've been waiting for you baby allright
Cause I'm in love with you my darling tonight
I'm in the mood for making you mine
