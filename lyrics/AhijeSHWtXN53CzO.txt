Life is fleeting by the slow
It chills us to the wave
And feeds me to the bone
And it's all right
Unless you feel you're too late

Life is fleeting to the sea
By making up your mind
So damn it to the wave
And it's all right
Unless you feel you're too late

So make up your gods
And take them in
It's the end
And it's all right
And it's all right

Life, it fits you like a glove
And you don't like the fit
So what's wrong?
'Cause even the devil finds love
The devil finds love
Unless you're too late

So make up your gods
And take them in
Love is dead
And it's all right
And it's all right

Life, it fits you like a glove
And you don't like the fit
So what's wrong?
'Cause even the devil finds love
The devil finds love
Unless you're too late
Unless you're too late

'Cause even if we're swept away
No one here could save us all
Even if we're swept away
No one here could save us all
Save us all
Your deathwish awaits

Why are you surprised that this is coming true?

Life, it fits you like a glove
And you don't like the fit
So what's wrong?
'Cause even the devil finds love
The devil finds love
Unless you're too late
Unless you're too late
Unless you're too late
Unless you're too late

'Cause even if we're swept away
No one here could save us all
Even if we're swept away
No one here could save us all
And it's all right
Yeah it's all right

It's all right
We belong to each other tonight
In a world that looks for a fight
We got a deathwish closing our eyes
It's all right
We belong to each other tonight
In a world that looks for a fight
We got a deathwish closing our eyesIt's all right
We belong to each other tonight
In a world that looks for a fight
We got a deathwish closing our eyesIt's all right
We belong to each other tonight
In a world that looks for a fight
We got a deathwish closing our eyesIt's all right
We belong to each other tonight
In a world that looks for a fight
We got a deathwish closing our eyes
