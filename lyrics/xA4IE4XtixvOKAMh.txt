Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Lost in the rocky road
Got lost in the promise of a love I never know
Shadows chase me far from home
I remember when my heart was filled with gold
And you knew I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You see me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth
My soul

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Lost my faith in trust
You and I know gold long turn to rust
I still swear that we can reign
Like the kings and queens of better yesterdays
Don't you know I've been burned,
I've been burned, I've been burned
You see me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth
My soul

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

We're gonna go
We're gonna go
We're gonna run to
Where you get to the edge of the night
This time you'll face the sky

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
