You bought your smile in a corner
You paid a pretty little penny, you did.

You paint yourself in a picture
As you deny the kind of person you've been
You get what you feel, what you wish to be
You can't live sarcastic sincerity
You sharpen your guilt like a guillotine

You get what you feel, you get what you feel
I gave you everything, you threw it away.
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.
Come on!
You pop right in to the moment,

You paid a pretty little penny, you did.
You never noticed how broken

As you deny the kind of person you've been
You get what you feel, what you wish to be
You can't live sarcastic sincerity
You sharpen your guilt like a guillotine
You get what you feel, you get what you feel

I gave you everything, you threw it away.
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.
You kneel to pray,
Live life on your knees embrace the disease.

Stop to breathe in as you start to choke, your life begins.
YOU PUT ME OUT! LIKE A CIGARETTE!
I gave you everything, you threw it away.
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.
