Well, breaking rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the, the law won
Well, I fought the law and the, the law won

Well, I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and the, the law won
Well, I fought the law and the, the law won

Well, I miss my baby and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run
She's the best friend I ever had
I fought the law and the, the law won
Well, I fought the law and the, the law won

Well, robbin' people with a six gun
I fought the law and the, the law won
Well, I fought the law and the, the law won

Yeah, I miss my baby and the good fun
I fought the law and the, the law won
Well, I fought the law and the, the law won

Well, I miss my baby and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run
She's the best friend I ever had
I fought the law and the, the law won
I fought the law and the, the law won

I fought the law and the, the law won
I fought the law and the, the law won
I fought the law and the, the law won

I fought the law and the, the law won
Hey, I fought the law and the, the law won
I fought the law and the, the law won
