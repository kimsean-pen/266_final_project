The sun shall arise,
my enemies yield,
purified by flames,
my true face unveiled

(Verse)
The time has come, the stars aligned
it's meant to be, i see the signs
out of the ashes, of beauty and power
a new beginning, this is the hour

(Bridge)
Thirsty souls bound by the silence
shall be reborn by their own story
and when the voices have risen
we will seal this pact of resurrecting glory

(Chorus)
This is the year of the phoenix
let all legends come to life
turn the silence into thunder
believe in one more wonder

(Intro to second verse)
Out of the old let the new arise
forged in fire stronger than demise

(Verse 2)
Another season has come and gone
there will be another one
with true intents we march forever
always striving to be better

(Bridge)
Within the elusive dreamer
slumbers a beauty almost pale
now awakened and renewed
creating another haunting tale

(Chorus)
This is the year of the phoenix
let all legends come to life
turn the silence into thunder
believe in one more wonder

Shall be reborn
by their own story

and when the voices
have risen
We'll seal the pact
of resurrecting glory

this is the year of the phoenix
that all legends come to life
turn the silence into thunder
believe in one more wonder (x2)

out of the old let
the new arise
forged in fire
stronger than demise

another season's come and gone
there'l be another one
with new intent we march forever
always trying to be better

within elusive dreaming
subversive beauty

creating another haunting tale

this is the year of the phoenix
that all legends come to life
turn the silence into thunder
believe in one more wonder (X 2)
