You can fall in love with the sea
You can buy roses from the man along the freeway
But my heart remains the same
My heart remains unchanged

Walking through the aisles of a drugstore
Artificial sweeteners in a line
But my heart remains resigned
My heart won't change it's mind

Waiting on a call
Eating oranges in a car
On a perfect spring day
My heart remains unchanged
