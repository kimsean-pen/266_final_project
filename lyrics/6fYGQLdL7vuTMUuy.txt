Did you hear me calling for you
From the top of the old trees
Heavy snow upon the branches
He tells me to let it be
Skate away on the ice

Did you hear me sing a song for you
From in between the needles too
I should learn to love you like the snow
He has learned to let me go

Ill become a kingfisher
A coloured flight
