Valiant in the midst of conflict
In memoriam honours distinctive
At half-mast the colours are raised
The tragic waste of life once gave

Immortalised plaque of remembrance
With reverence their names are listed
Glorified and in honour held
In commemorance of those that fell

To those once loyal now wreathed in crimson
Solemn reminder of silent sacrifice
To the once loyal forever wrapped in glory
In white crossed acres - lines of sorrow laid

To those once loyal now wreathed in crimson
Solemn reminder of silent sacrifice
To the once loyal forever wrapped in glory
In white crossed acres - lines of sorrow laid

Brave are the deeds
Of fallen victorious
Never forgotten
Lonely are the glorious
