This is a song called Change

I don't feel the sun's coming out today
It's staying in now, it's gonna find another way yeah
As I sit here in this misery I don't
Think I'll ever no
See the sun from here
And oh as I fade away
Some people will say, yeah
They'll all look at me and they'll say
"Hey, look at him"

I'll never live that way
And that's ok
Just afraid to change

When you feel life ain't worth living
You've got to stand up, and
Take a look around, look up way to the sky, hell yeah
And when your deepest thoughts are broken
Keep on dreamin' boy, when you stop dreamin' it's time to die
And I don't want to die
And as we all play parts of tomorrow
Some ways we'll work, and other ways we'll play, yeah
But I know we can't all stay here forever
So I'm gonna write my words on the face of today
And then they'll paint it

Give me a fantasy, you gotta play me a tune
One that can make us all happy
Give me the days to take us down from these blues
Baby play a song, baby play a guitar
Baby make it snappy yeah
You are the one who can make us all happy
Why do it baby, no you bring out the tears
Don't be so sad, if you were in my new head
Right now, known you for all of these years

And oh as I fade away
They'll all look at me and say
Yeah they'll look at me and say
"Hey look at him, and where he is these days?"
When life is hard you have to change
When life is hard you have to change
Mmm
