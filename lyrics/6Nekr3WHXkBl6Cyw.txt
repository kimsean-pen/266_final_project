Oh wonderful one why are you like that?
Oh wonderful one why are you like that?
Glow in the darkness, that's how we do it.
Glow in the darkness, that's how we do it.
Just like the stars upon your ceiling that,
put you to sleep after.

Close the blind the darkness of your room,
in your room.
In your room.
There's your headache explain it at your talk-talk-talk,
hanging with your feet-feet-feet,
hanging with your feet.
Cause' here
we are
apart but not
again
and again,
again
and again.
That doesn't make sense.
So put away your tools.

Let me show.
Let me show.
Let me show.

And in the end they ask you for
your reply.
Don't you tell them.
What you found out.
There's time.
