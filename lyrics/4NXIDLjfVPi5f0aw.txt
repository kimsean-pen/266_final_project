I feel the city breathe at night
Beneath the stars and meteor lights
And I've got nothing to lose

Drink up (drink up) drink up the loneliness
Drink up (drink up) drink up the loneliness

The streets outside, they burn with light
But I am dead on the inside
I think these pills are to blame

Drink up (drink up) drink up the loneliness
Drink up (drink up) drink up the loneliness

And I've got romantic ideas
But they're not meant for you
And my best feeling
Black roses to show that our love is through

I hope the fire licks my lips
And pulls me close against the wrists
This town will go down in flames

Drink up, drink up, drink up the loneliness
Drink up, drink up, drink up the loneliness

And I've got romantic ideas
But they're not meant for you
And my best feeling
Black roses to show that our love is through

Like a broken mirror
They're pieces of me
Like a broken mirror
They're pieces of me
They're pieces of me
They're pieces of me now

Drink up (drink up) drink up the loneliness
Drink up (drink up) drink up my lonely
Drink up, my lonely
Drink up
Drink up the loneliness
