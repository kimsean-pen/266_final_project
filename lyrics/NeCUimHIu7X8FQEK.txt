Share my cup
tie me up
never part
break my heart

Go to sleep
wound me deep
be at peace
make me bleed

Do no harm
twist my arm
lie with grace
smash my face

Kiss the ground
drag me down
stop the noise
smash my toys

How does it feel without your drugs?
(sing you a lullaby)
how does it feel without my love?
(sing you a lullaby)
