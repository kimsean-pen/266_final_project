I dig up the Earth to hide my soul
Without it
I feel so cold

I'm trying to save me from myself
So if I break
No one can tell
And I'll go where no Angels dare to dwell
And I'll dance to the voices in my head

Don't speak when I dream a second time
My heart is nowhere to be found
Buried six feet underground

Don't speak when I dream a second time
My heart is nowhere to be found
Buried six feet underground

And I will live a second time
My heart is nowhere to be found
Buried six feet underground

Don't speak when I dream a second time
My heart is nowhere to be found
Buried six feet underground

Don't speak when I dream a second time
My heart is nowhere to be found
Buried six feet underground

And I will live a second time
My heart is nowhere to be found
Buried six feet underground
