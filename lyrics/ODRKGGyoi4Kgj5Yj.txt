Let them see them in
Early days

I was in a basement
Placement payment came in
That shit was bananas
Bustin' through my homie door like Costanza
Think we ready
To fuck these niggas up
With my nigga Freddie
In a checkered pickup truck
Pickin' up hella Henny
Lookin' for the hoes

I'm wildin' 'cause it's all I know
I'm hoping I don't waste it
Just tryna to buy my mama clothes
Pray my prayers to the Base God
'Cause mama say she think I'm chose
I'm hoping I don't waste it

I always picture picture-perfect
Must have been out of my mind
Tried to figure if this shit was really worth it
But is it worth this?
Probably not, probably got
Worse off my few shots
I hit "The Boondocks"
Play me off the boombox
Bombaclast bastards
Making music for the masses
But I'm zooted off this gas
And I be trippin' off this acid

Apple at my last show
Bitches in my bathroom
Hit the stage with my hands full of liquor
I'm wildin' 'cause it's all I know
I'm hoping I don't waste this
Just tryna to buy my mama clothes
Pray my prayers to the Base God
'Cause mama say she think I'm chosen
I'm hoping I don't waste-

Kick it in the back
Feelin' black and broke
Sittin' in the back
Sipping Jack and coke

Kick it in the back
With them background folk
Joke on you
She like background folks

Kick it in the back
Feelin' black and broke
Sittin' in the back
Sipping Jack and coke

Kick it in the back
With them black man folk
Joke on you
She like black man (black man)

Apple at my last show
Bitches in my bathroom
Hit the stage with my hands full of liquor
I'm wildin' 'cause it's all I know
I'm hoping I don't waste this

Just tryna to buy my mama clothes
Pray my prayers to the Base God
'Cause mama say she think I'm chosen
I'm hoping I don't waste this
I'm hoping I don't waste this
I'm hoping I don't waste this
