In a town on the heights,
We met in sound,
Let the cover of night
Draw us down,
Further south
Where I was young
And caught up,
In the skies on the way.
I see them now.

I'm not the same,
Nor you with your little one
Who needs more than love.
A mother afraid,
I had it so easy,
You were the one who fought.
Was I a better man
When you held me up,
And gave me back more than time?
Was I a better man,
With you Sol?

Maybe time has the key,
To one last door.
Where our eyes cannot meet
Without being sure,
That the sound had always
Run inside us,
From a start out of reach,
I see it now.

I'm not the same,
Nor you with your little one
Who needs more than love.
A mother afraid,
I had it so easy,
You were the one who fought.
Was I a better man
When you held me up,
And gave me back more than time?
Was I a better man,
With you Sol?

Some shimmers hide the way,
And when the idols are gone
The sun raises others the same,
Knowing well,
The silent thought has no answer, no.
Maybe I was too blind
To recognize
The buried fire
Was lying aglow.
If I need no forgiveness
I'm all but forgotten,
Lost in the changing of the times.
With dust on the table,
The quena lies broken,
Waiting on one last songline,
To live another life
Dream it Sol.
Said I'm sorry that I never wrote,
Though I meant to I just couldn't start.
Most of the time I spend alone,
Just trying to make sense of it all.
Have you ever been alone?
No you ain't ever been alone,
No, not really Sol.
No you ain't ever been alone,
No, not really Sol.
