There was a girl I knew
Who always wanted to
Be the one to stand out from the crowd
Always believed that she
Was gonna live for dreams
That what went down was gonna come around

For all the doubters, non-believers
The cynical that once were dreamers
One of these days you'll open up your eyes
And you'll realize

That girl was a one-time teenage drama queen
A hot, tough everyday wannabe
But she'll have changed her destiny
Now she's a somebody
That girl was a wild child dreamer
But she'll find herself
'cause she believes in nothing else
Then you'll look back when you won't believe
That girl was me

Armed with an attitude that she knows how to use
She's gonna get there any way she can
Now she knows what she wants
No one is gonna stop her
Nothing's ever gonna hold her back

For all the doubters, non-believers
The cynical that once were dreamers
One of these days you'll know that you were wrong
Who would know?

That girl was a one-time teenage drama queen
A hot, tough everyday wannabe
But she'll have changed her destiny
Now she's a somebody
That girl was a wild child dreamer
But she'll find herself
'cause she believes in nothing else
Then you'll look back and you won't believe
That girl was me

Life is a work of art
You gotta paint it colorful
Can make it anything you want
Don't ever stick to any rules
You don't need a high IQ
To succeed in what you do
You just gotta have no doubt
Just believe in yourself

Doubters, non-believers
Once were her dreamers
One of these days you'll open up your eyes
And you'll realize

That girl was a one-time teenage drama queen
A hot, tough everyday wannabe
But she'll have changed her destiny
Now she's a somebody
That girl was a wild child dreamer
But she'll find herself
'cause she believes in nothing else
Then you'll look back and you won't believe
That girl was me
That girl was a one-time teenage drama queen
A hot, tough everyday wannabe
But she'll have changed her destiny
Now she's a somebody
