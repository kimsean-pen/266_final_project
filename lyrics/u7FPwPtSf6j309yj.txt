You laugh at the wall, while your head is spinning
Isn't it strange? You're at the center of it
And guess what, it's not the view that you love
There's no pain
When it's just you and silence

Is it an ilussion, drifting through your life?
Ain't it sorta funny
When you're laughing for your life

When this is all I have left to feel
What a slow sigh
For once I'll take my time
And I'll lay myself in an empty field
What a slow life
For once I'll take my time

When this is all I have left to feel
What a slow sigh
For once I'll take my time
And I'll lay myself in an empty field
What a slow life
For once I'll take my time
