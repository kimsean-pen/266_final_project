Ohhhh

(Miss Badu told me I'm)

Most these sheeple, move like clones
That's why I be
On my own
My mama thought I was a joke
But Miss Badu told me, I'm dope
Yeah, I'm dope
Yeah yeah I'm dope
Miss Badu told me I'm

And I know it
You can't tell me
Nothing else
That's why
Every beat I'm on is water and I'm Michael Phelps
Told my partnas
Get yo bread up
But that dope don't
Equal wealth
But you can't help all yo partnas
Unless you done, helped yourself

So I need more than kudos and a high-five
Cause I went from sidelines to the limelight and I shine bright
Ice cold bars, Klondike
And I never moved with the white
This ain't blindside

Oouuu
Finite but you feel the spirit
Whole flow shine like, soul glow
Every lyric (soul glow)
Skin cocoa so
Most popo fear it
9 like Rondo on my clothes
When I pivot
Oouu

Most these sheeple, move like clones (move like clones)
That's why I be
On my own (I be on my own)
My mama thought I was a joke (She thought I was a joke)
But Dave Chapelle told me, I'm dope
Yeah, I'm dope
Yeah yeah I'm dope
Dave Chapelle told me I'm

And I know it
You can't tell me
Nothing else
That's why
Every beat I'm on is water and I'm Michael Phelps
Me and my dogs eat like kings
But we be working just like slaves
I done made it outta my hood
I deserve some accolades

Cause I maneuver
Through the doo-doo like a
Bottle of metamucil in a body that's used to being constipated
And most consumers they view me as a ruler like Mansa Musa
Cause I stay with some jewels that can exonerate
em' from every ounce of troubled water they been in
Spend-in
Time and place it ain't safe to swim in
Without yellin' I try to tell em'
They should make amends
Because

Where you from
Where I'm from
You see, so much pain (so much pain)
But the kid
Do it big
Now they know my name (know my name)
I done got it out the mud (aye)
And put on for my day ones

That's why Miss Badu and Dave Chapelle
Show a young playa love (show a young playa love)
