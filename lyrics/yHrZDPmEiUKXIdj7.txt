Hey girl,
Don't listen to your mother
When she tells you you ain't pretty
Need to look more like the others

Hey boy,
Don't let your daddy tell you
If you don't got it together
That you're gonna be a failure

Let's stop letting everyone
Tell us how to feel
Tell us how to dream
Let's stop letting everyone
Tell us how to live
Tell us who to be

Oh no no am I getting too loud?
Am I getting too loud?
Am I getting too loud?
Oh no no am I getting in your head?
Am I getting in your head?
Getting in your head?

Oh no no am I getting too loud?
Am I getting too loud?
Am I getting too loud?
Oh no no am I getting in your head?
Am I getting in your head?
Getting in your head?

You know they're coming for your fire
When they try to push you lower
But you keep on going higher
You're a flame,
And they all wanna water you down
Wanna water you down down

Let's stop letting everyone
Tell us how to feel
Tell us how to dream
Let's stop letting everyone
Tell us how to live
Tell us who to be

Oh no no am I getting too loud?
Am I getting too loud?
Am I getting too loud?
Oh no no am I getting in your head?
Am I getting in your head?
Getting in your head?

Oh no no am I getting too loud?
Am I getting too loud?
Am I getting too loud?
Oh no no am I getting in your head?
Am I getting in your head?
Getting in your head?

Gonna make you listen
Gonna make you move
You can't ignore the truth inside you

Gonna make you listen
Gonna make you move
You can't ignore the truth inside you

Oh no no am I getting too loud?
Am I getting too loud?
Am I getting too loud?
Oh no no am I getting in your head?
Am I getting in your head?
Getting in your head?

Oh no no am I getting too loud?
Am I getting too loud?
Am I getting too loud?
Oh no no am I getting in your head?
Am I getting in your head?
Getting in your head?
