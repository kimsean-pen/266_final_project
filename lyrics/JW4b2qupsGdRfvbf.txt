Now it's day, I've been trying to get that taste off my tongue
I was dreaming of just you, now our cereal, it is warm
Attractive day in the rubble of the night from before
Now I can't walk in a vacuum, I feel ugly, feel my pores
It's the trees of this day that I do battle with for the light
Then I start to feel tragic, people greet me, I'm polite
"What's the day? " "What are you doing? "
"How's your mood? " "How's that song? "
Man it passes right by me, it's behind me, now it's gone
And I can't lift you up cause my mind is tired
It's family beaches that I desire
A sacred night, where we'll watch the fireworks
The frightened babies poo
They've got two flashing eyes and they're colored why
They make me feel that I'm only all I see sometimes.

I've been eating with a good friend who said
"A Genii made me out of the earth's skin"
But in spite of her she is my birth kin
She spits me out in her surely blood rivers
All the people that lurking in dominions of a hot Turk dish
If elephants are reaching for our purses, then meet me after the world with the shivers.

And I can't lift you up cause my mind is tired, it's family beaches that I desire
That sacred night where we watched the fireworks
They frightened the babies and you know they've got two flashing eyes
And if they are color blind, they make me feel, that you're only what I see sometimes.
