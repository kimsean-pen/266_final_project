Dem a go tired fe see me face
Can't get me out of the race
Oh man you said I'm in your place
And then you draw bad card
A make you draw bad card
And then you draw bad card

Propaganda spreading over my name
Say you want to bring another life to shame
Oh man you just playing a game
And then you draw bad card, draw bad card
A make you draw bad card, draw bad card
A make you draw bad card

I want to disturb my neighbour
Cause I'm feeling so right
I want to turn up my disco
Blow them to full watts tonight
In a rub-a-dub style, in a rub-a-dub style
In a rub-a-dub style, in a rub-a-dub style

Cause we guarding the palace so majestic
Guarding the palace so realistic
Them a go tired fe see we face, oh yeah
Me say them can't get we out of the race
Oh man it's just a big disgrace

The way you draw bad card, draw bad card
The way you make wrong moves, make wrong moves
The way you draw bad card, draw bad card
A make you draw bad card, draw bad card
A make you draw bad card
In a rub-a-dub style, in a rub-a-dub style
