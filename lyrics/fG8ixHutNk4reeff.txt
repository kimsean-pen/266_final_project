Blast off
He'll try to shoot you with precision
Take your face off
Young disciple into life
He was hung up,
By the meaning of existence
You be let down
So don't you fall in with the

Velociraptor!
He's gonna find ya!
He's gonna kill ya!
He's gonna eat ya!
You're on the outskirts
Of his kingdom
So keep your head down!
Veloci– Velociraptor

Shake down
Go get your suitcase
Call a director
Tell everyone in sight
This is an air raid
You wanna get laid?
But he is closing
He ain't toothless man

Velociraptor!
He's gonna find ya!
He's gonna kill ya!
He's gonna eat ya!
You're on the outskirts
Of his kingdom
So keep your head down!
Veloci– Velociraptor

Woooooooaaaaah!
There's nothing to it!
There's nothing to it man!
Woooooooaaaaah!
There's nothing to it!
There's nothing to it man!

And now your lying here
Just staring at the moon
Just wanna suck
Your blood

Blast off
On the model for collision
Get scared now
'Cause there's nowhere left to hide
Are you ready?
Feel the scratching getting closer
There's no foolin
And you're the only one alive

The voodoo
The vaccine
The boredom
The routine
Detaching your movement
It's all got too much
For the addicts
The manics
The paper
The vapour
The pressure
Of so called
Normal behaviour

Woooooooaaaaah!
There's nothing to it!
There's nothing to it man!
Woooooooaaaaah!
There's nothing to it!
There's nothing to it man!

You walk the city streets
While everyones asleep
Just wanna suck
Your blood

Velociraptor!
He's gonna find ya!
He's gonna kill ya!
He's gonna eat ya!
You're on the outskirts
Of his kingdom
So keep your head down!
Veloci– Velociraptor
