Don't Call Me Pain
My name is mystery
Don't Call Me Pain
My name is mystery
Don't Call Me Pain
This is the age of chance
This is the age of chance
Don't call me pain
Being afraid is power
T-O-R-T-U-R-E
Being afraid is power
T-O-R-T-U-R-E
Being afraid is power
T-O-R-T-U-R-E
Soldiers soldiers soldiers
March through your eyes
Obey because you either love or fear
Mercy mercy mercy
Let U.S. bleed happily
Let U.S. bleed in peace
Nothing is impossible
When you're living on the brink
Shown the world
But cut off your hands
We fear what we do not understand
Soldiers soldiers soldiers
March through your eyes
Fire your finger in the dark
Fire your finger in the dark
Don't Call Me Pain
My name is mystery
Don't Call Me Pain
My name is mystery
This is the age of chance so they say
