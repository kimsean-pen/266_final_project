Holographic, fantastic
You see this beat? Uh, she's drastic
I blur blur, no pores on her
F-I-E-R-C-E
Kitty kitty, purr purr purr
Glitter stick, glitter stick, glitter stick
Concealed eyes with a cherrybomb lip
Skin tint, skin tint, skin tint
Keep my makeup artist tied up in the basement
This lip and cheek got your boyfriend weak
These streets? Shook
When they see me live my look, uh

Read about it in Vogue
Saw billboards on Broome
1 / 28, 9pm
Stage, tore down the show
Watch this tomboy transform
My friends break gender norms
We both wear pink platforms
And we go nowhere without that cooling water
They fall in love with the face
Even when I put them in they place
Lip, sheer hot pink
Everybody wanna get a taste, uh
Of this lip and cheek
It still got yo boyfriend weak
And these streets? Shook
When they see me live my look, uh
