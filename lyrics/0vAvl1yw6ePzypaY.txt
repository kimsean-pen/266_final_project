All these people are passed out
On the floor in my hotel room
I don't know half of them but they all wanna know me

And it's four in the morning
I'm just trying to fix myself
What the hell did I do?
I'm the life of the party

Somewhere in between
Who I used to be
And who I'll be tomorrow
When the champagne blows my mind

Thrills don't come for free
The price you pay for dreams
In a sea of strangers
I can't find me anymore
Anymore
I can't find me anymore

I keep thinking about you
How you level me out sometimes
Went on out of my head
And I don't wanna face it

You said it's all for a reason
What the fuck is the reason now?
Coming down, bring me back
I'm the life of the party

(I'm the life of the party)

Somewhere in between
Who I used to be
And who I'll be tomorrow
When the champagne blow my mind

Thrills don't come for free
The price you pay for dreams
In a sea of strangers
I can't find me anymore
Anymore
I can't find me anymore
Anymore
I can't find me anymore

Now it's four in the morning
I'm trying to fix myself
What the hell did I do?
I'm the life of the party

It's so hard to imagine
Who I'd be if I walked away
Never know what it's like
To be the life of the party

(I'm the life of the party)
(I'm the life of the party)

Somewhere in between
Who I used to be
And who I'll be tomorrow
When the champagne blows my mind

Thrills don't come for free
The price you pay for dreams
In a sea of strangers
I can't find me anymore
Anymore
I can't find me anymore
Anymore
I can't find me anymore
