Frozen in time, when the world is moving
At the speed of light, trapped inside
These walls, you can't rise until you fall
And start to trust your heart over your mind

A diamond turned to stone
From the fear of falling
Into the great unknown
You're trapped in endless night
You've lost the will to fight
Like a lantern that's lost its burn

You're a hundred feet above the ocean
And the water's all you need
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap
Right now you can't see the path before you
Horizon is out of reach
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap

These chains grow stronger with time
But then it's broken
You're not alone in this fight
Trapped inside this shell
The best version of ourselves
Is waiting to escape this hell

You're a hundred feet above the ocean
And the water's all you need
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap
Right now you can't see the path before you
Horizon is out of reach
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap

The only way to survive this life
Is to take the leap
The only way to survive this life
Is to take the leap

You're a hundred feet above the ocean
And the water's all you need
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap
Right now you can't see the path before you
Horizon is out of reach
But you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap
(Take the leap)

The only way to survive this life
Is to take the leap
The only way to survive this life
Is to take the leap

(The only way to survive this life
Is to take the leap)
