You can look, but you can't touch
I don't think I like you much
Heaven knows what a girl can do
Heaven knows what you've got to prove

I think I'm paranoid
And complicated
I think I'm paranoid
Manipulate it

Bend me, break me anyway you need me
All I want is you
Bend me, break me, breaking down is easy
All I want is you
I fall down just to give you a thrill
Prop me up with another pill

If I should fail, if I should fold
I nailed my faith to the sticking pole
I think I'm paranoid
Manipulate it

I think I'm paranoid
And complicated
Bend me, break me anyway you need me
All I want is you

Bend me, break me, breaking down is easy
All I want is you

I think I'm paranoid
I think I'm paranoid
Bend me, break me anyway you need me
All I want is you

Bend me, break me, breaking down is easy
All I want is you
Steal me, deal me, anyway you heal me
Maim me, tame me, you can never change me
Love me, like me, come ahead and fight me
Please me, tease me, go ahead and leave me
Bend me, break me anyway you need me
As long as I want you, baby, it's alright
Bend me, break me any way you need me
As long as I want you, baby, it's alright
