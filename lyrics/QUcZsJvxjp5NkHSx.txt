I never really feel quite right
And I don't know why, all I know is something's wrong
Every time I look at you, you seem so alive

Tell me how do you do it, walk me through it
I'm following every footstep

Maybe on your own you take a conscious step
Do you wanna give it up? All that I want

Is for you to shine
Shine down on me
Shine on this life that's burning out

I say a lot of things sometimes that don't come out right
And I act like I don't know why
I guess a reaction's all I was looking for, yeah

You looked through me,
You really knew me like no one's ever looked before

Maybe on your own you take a cautious step
Do you wanna give it up? All that I want

Is for you to shine
Shine down on me
Shine on this life that's burning out

I know, I know, girl you got something

SHINE (shine it on to me)
Shine down on me (I wanna feel it)
Shine on this life that's burning out

Maybe on your own you take a cautious step
Do you wanna give it up? All that I want

Is for you to shine
Shine down on me (just show me something)
Shine on this life that's burning out
(you give me something that I'll never know)

Shine (it gonna kill me, if you give something away)
Shine yeah (I wanna know what's going in on your mind)
Shine on this life that's burning out

Don't you know, I want you to shine
Shine down on me
Shine on this life that's burning out
