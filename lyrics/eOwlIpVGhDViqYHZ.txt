When we met, light was shed
Thoughts free flow
You said you've got
something
Deep inside of you
A wind chime voice sounds
Sway of your hips 'round rings true
It goes
deep inside of you
These secret garden beams
Change my life so it seems
A fall breeze blows outside

I don't break stride
Thoughts are warm
And they go

deep inside of you

Oh yeah
Well I never felt alone
Alright
Oh oh uh, oh oh uh
Till I met you

Friends say I've changed
I don't listen

'Cause I live to be
Deep inside of you

Slide up her dress
Shouts in darkness
I'm so alive

I'm deep inside of you
You said
boy made girl feel good
But still,

deep inside
Still
I never felt alone,
till I met you

I'm alright on my own

And then I met you
And I'd know what to do
If I just knew, what's comin'

I would change myself if I could
I walk with my people

if I could find them
And I'd say that I'm sorry to you
I'm sorry to you
And I don't wanna call you
But then I wanna call you
'Cause I don't wanna crush you
But I feel like crushing you
And it's true, I took for granted
You were with me
I breathe by your looks
And you look right through me
(We were broken)
(Didn't know it)
(We were broken)
(Didn't know it)
(We were broken)
(Didn't know it)
(We were broken)
(Didn't know it)
(Lies, all lies)
(That's right)
(All)
Somethings gone
You withdraw
I'm not strong, like before
I was deep inside of you
I can go nowhere
I burn candles and stare
At a ghost
Deep inside of you
And some great need in me
Starts to bleed,
I've lost myself
There's nothin' left,
it's all gone
Deep inside of you
Deep inside of you
Mmmm
Deep inside of you
