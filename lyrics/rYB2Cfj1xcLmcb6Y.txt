I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two, three times, in a row
It's a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Lookin so crazy your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh

When I talk to my friends so quietly, "Who he think he is?"
Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes don't even need to buy a new dress
You ain't there, ain't nobody left to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
'Cause I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy your love's got me looking

Got me looking so crazy in love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh

Got me looking
So crazy, my baby
I'm not myself
Lately I'm foolish
I don't do this
I've been playing myself
But baby I don't care
'Cause baby your love's got the best of me
Baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
Baby you got me
You got me going crazy
Ohh ohh

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love got me looking so crazy right now
Ohh, ohh
Got me looking so crazy right now your love
Got me looking so crazy right now

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh no no
Oh oh oh oh
