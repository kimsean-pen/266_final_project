My mumma don't tell I'm the same
My mumma don't tell me to fall in line
My mumma don't tell me to wait its fine
My mumma don't feel my heart was gone
My mumma don't tell me to walk this line
Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
My mumma don't tell I'm the same
My mumma don't tell me to fall in line
My mumma don't tell me to wait its fine
My mumma don't feel my heart was gone
My mumma don't tell me to walk this line
Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
