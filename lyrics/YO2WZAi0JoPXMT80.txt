They know the way to be the one
Faces
For every time they got

Ooh, never walk on the sun
till we can't find a way to love
Ooh, never walk on the sun
till you won't touch your face no more
Ooh, never walk on the sun
till we can't find a way to love
Ooh, never walk on the sun
till you won't touch your face no more
