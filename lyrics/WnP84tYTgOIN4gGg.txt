Dear world, I'm writing this song for you
Dear world, I know what you're going through
I know you're scared about tomorrow, scared of feeling hollow
I am too
Dear world, I'm writing this song for you

Dear world, you ain't all that I thought you would be
A few trips ago 'round the sun
I'm trying to find out what it means to be me
I feel like I've barely begun
How many souls can be crowded together
And all of us feeling alone?
All of us longing for hope
All of us longing for hope

Dear world, I'm learning to be the change
Dear world, your beauty is born from pain
You're looking for the magic to rise above the tragic
I am too
Dear world, I'm writing this song for you

Dear world, you ain't all that I thought you would be
A few trips ago 'round the sun
I'm trying to find out what it means to be me
I feel like I've barely begun
How many souls can be crowded together
And all of us feeling alone?
All of us longing for hope
All of us longing for hope
All of us longing for hope
Dear world
