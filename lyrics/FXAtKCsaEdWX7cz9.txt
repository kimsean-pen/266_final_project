Life, I blame your minds that get a pain,
they're always risin' over crime...
They want my skin, collapsin' my brain...
Their better healin' is rainworm cry!

They cast me over that quiverin' shroud!
They're overflowin' of hatred inside,
and now I'm longin' for burnin' alive
and never see their rainstorm night!

This time, we go back to life!
This time, I'm gonna get you!
Cries, cradlin' a ghoul,
hooded my pain...
...And there's no even fall of life...
No rainfall time
engraves me inside,
the better healin' is a haunted sigh!

They cast me over that quiverin' shroud!
They're overflowin' of hatred inside,
and now I'm longin' for burnin' alive
and never see their rainstorm night.

This time, they'll go deep in the dark!
