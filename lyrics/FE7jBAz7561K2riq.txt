Burn everything you have and leave it all behind
Lose all your inhibitions
I'll take the mess you made and I'll make it beautiful
Oh, if time only stood still forever

Hold out your hands and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again

Hold out your hands and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again

This moment that we're in is slow and disappointing
Time will never stand still forever
If you take this chance we've got, we can make it beautiful
If you'd take my word, I'd be your saviour

Hold out your hands and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again

Hold out your hands and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands and lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again

Hold out your hands and lean upon me
Hold out your hands and lean upon me
Hold out your hands and lean upon me
Hold out your hands and lean upon me

Burn everything you have and leave it all behind
Lose all your inhibitions
I took the mess you made and I'll make it beautiful
Oh, if time only stood still forever, forever
