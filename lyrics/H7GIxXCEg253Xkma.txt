I can't be all that you wanted
But I could be all that you need
When you get close to me I lose control
And now that you're far away
I lost it all

Don't let me go

We used to breathe in the silence
Your hands drew all over me
I found comfort in your words and lost control
And now that you're far away
I lost it all

So don't leave me here on my own
Without you I'm so lost
Without you I'm so cold
So don't leave me here on my own
Without you I'm so lost
Without you I'm so cold
