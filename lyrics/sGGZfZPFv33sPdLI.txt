Hey little sister
Are you ready to dance in the dark
Can you believe and defy death?
It's only skin and bones blood in red
In this rotting flesh

Hey little sister
Are you trapped in a life
Where you need a little something to kill time?
A short while till the blood runs red
And the sun won't shine

Hey, hey, hey
Come tranquilize
(I'm willing death come please call my name)
We'll die in the sunset
Hey, hey, hey
Come tranquilize
(I'm willing death come please call my name)
We'll play in the darkness

Hey little sister
Have you suffered enough for one life
Come down from the clouds now?
I've made a trade for your soul
I'll give you mine
I don't even care how

Hey, hey, hey
Come tranquilize
(I'm willing death come please call my name)
We'll die in the sunset
Hey, hey, hey
Come tranquilize
(I'm willing death come please call my name)
We'll play in the darkness

Hey, hey, hey
Come tranquilize
(I'm willing death come please call my name)
We'll die in the sunset
Hey, hey, hey
Come tranquilize
(I'm willing death come please call my name)
We'll play in the darkness

Hey, hey, hey
Come tranquilize
(I'm willing death come please call my name)
We'll die in the sunset
Hey, hey, hey
Come tranquilize
(I'm willing death come please call my name)
We'll play in the darkness
