Don't make a sound
My sign's holding together, I keep
And don't let the blind persuade you
You're better
These desperate eyes move one
Just another branch tree
You'll tear the hand grip just to rev and twitch
You'll never admit,
You'll never admit

You said my love is gone
Our love's been going wrong forever now
Why, why?
You said my love is gone
Our love's been going wrong forever now
Why, why?

Don't try to change your ways
Hopeful for relevant bliss
You know that it's fine
Refrain, it's not forever
Oh it's a crime to fight
Just a regrettable twist
That you'll never admit
That you'll never admit

You said my love is gone
Our love's been going wrong forever now
Why, why?
You said my love is gone
Our love's been going wrong forever now
Why, why?

You said my love is gone
Our love's been going wrong forever now
Why, why?
You said my love is gone
Our love's been going wrong forever now
Why, why?
