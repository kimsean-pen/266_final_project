In the twilight when he steps forth
In the bend of the dark path
When he catches up with you
You won't know if he's on your side
Or if he will turn against you

And in the dead of a moonless night
As your path turns into the black
You become one with the darkness
And in the dead of a moonless night
Who knows if you are brothers
Or will you turn against each other

And in the dusk when he finds you
Hidden in the shadows
He must judge your allegiance
He won't know if you're on his side
Or if you will turn against him

And in the dead of a moonless night
As your path turns into the black
You become one with the darkness
And in the dead of a moonless night
Who knows if you are brothers
Or will you turn against each other
