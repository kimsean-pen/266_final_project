Pull out my hair for fun and run my nails right down my face
Wake up disoriented almost every single day
Wishing each dream I had was real finding
out they're not and that I'm trapped in here
With myself in my room alone alone (alone alone)
You may think life is fun
But sometimes I don't see it that way
I started medication weaned myself off
That happiness was artificial and fake
Don't you agree?
If my happiness has to be forced then it wasn't meant to be

Oh I don't wanna force it I'm fine
Listen when I say I wanna die with at least
A quick release of every bad thing that has ever happened to me

Take my hand to the end
I wanna see it all fall
I wanna watch my mind break with it

Take my hand to the end
I wanna see it all fall
I wanna watch my mind break with it

My mind is melting
From things around it
Like caskets buried
With dirt around them
I tried to climb out
But I fell back in
I'll put up white flags to tell them I give in
