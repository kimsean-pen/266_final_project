The winter's marred the earth
It's floored with frozen glass
You slip into my arms
And you quickly correct yourself

Your freezing speech bubbles
Seem to hold your words aloft
I want the smoky clouds of laughter
To swim about me forevermore

I will race you to the waterside
And from the edge of Ireland shout out loud
So they could hear it in America
It's all for you

The shells crack under our shoes
Like punctuation points
The planets bend between us
A hundred million suns and stars

The sea filled in the silence
Before you said those words
And now even in the darkness
I can see how happy you are

I will race you to the waterside
And from the edge of Ireland shout out loud
So they could hear it in America
It's all for you, it's all for you
It's all for you, it's all for you
It's all for you
