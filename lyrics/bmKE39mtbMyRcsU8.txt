I've been waiting on tonight
Crystallize, crystallize
I've been looking in your eyes
We're on the rise, on the rise

Daylight grows
Rising from the East again
Oh my mind is woke
But my heart it never slept

And truth be told
I'm ready for the sky to light
With the alpenglow

Saw it in a fading dream
The world we knew is obsolete
Never thought our time would come to end

But silence isn't all it seems
Knowing that my heart still beats
Suddenly my feet were found again

(I've been waiting on tonight)
I...
Thought the future was for giving
And the past was just for living
(In your eyes)
I...
And this is where the truth begins

The story goes
That I can't comprehend
What time bestows
On youthful innocence

But now I know
That the seasons turn and end
And I won't let go

So listen to that symphony
Ringing out into the streets
Never will I lose myself again

And simple though the imagery
It's turning into all I see
Suddenly my feet were found again

(I've been waiting on tonight)
I...
Thought the future was for giving
And the past was just for living
(In your eyes)
Eyes...
And this is where the truth begins

I've been waiting on tonight
Crystallize, crystallize
I've been looking in your eyes
We're on the rise, on the rise
We're on the rise, on the rise
