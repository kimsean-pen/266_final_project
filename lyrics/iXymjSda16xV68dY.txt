You say the word and I'll go wild, start a fire in a heartbeat
If you get drunk then so will I, crazy highs if you need it
Your skin is like the gallows mapped a goal
Come pull me in and don't let go
I'll tell you all my favorite lies
Close your eyes, and believe me

The things we do
For the love, for the love
I put you through
For the love, for the love
I'm hurt by you
But then I'm healing, I get the feeling
We can leave but we don't
For the love, for the love

For the love, for the love
For the love, for the love
For the love, for the love
For the love, for the love

We shoot these arrows from the heart
Fully armed, we go blasting
This everlasting code of ours
I'll pick you up when you ask me

The things we do
For the love, for the love
I put you through
For the love, for the love
I'm hurt by you
But then I'm healing, I get the feeling
We can leave but we don't
For the love, for the love

For the love, for the love
For the love, for the love
For the love, for the love
For the love, for the love
For the love, for the love

We run these wires until they fall
We'll keep on crawling back until we lost all
Bask in the glory, the highs and lows
No matter how far gone we are we don't let go

The things we do
For the love, for the love
I put you through
For the love, for the love
Under by you
But then I'm healing, I get the feeling
We can leave but we don't
For the love, for the love

For the love, for the love
For the love, for the love
For the love, for the love
For the love, for the love
For the love, for the love
For the love, for the love
For the love, for the love
For the love, for the love
