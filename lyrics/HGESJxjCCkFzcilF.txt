Every time I close my eyes
I can touch the colors around me
Suddenly, I realize
Everything I thought was impossible is here

My heart sings in a world so incredible
And everything burns much brighter
I, I wanna fly, I into this beautiful life

I think it'd be nice with you
I, wanna fly, I into this beautiful life
I think it'd be nice with you
With you, with you, with you

Finger tips, northern lights
Tracing colors right through the sky
Underneath a lullaby

I never felt as blissful as I do
Here, and my heart sings in a world so incredible
And everything shines much brighter
I, I wanna fly, I into this beautiful life
I think it'd be nice with you
I, wanna fly, I into this beautiful life

I think it'd be nice with you
With you, with you, with you
Set the night on fire if we want to
Hanging out with the stars and the big moon
Very well thank you, how do you do?
Set the night on fire if we want to
Hanging out with the stars and the big moon
Pull 'em down for a dance with your last soon
I think it'd be nice with you, with you
I think it'd be nice with you, with you
I think it'd be nice with you, with you
I think it'd be nice with you, with you
