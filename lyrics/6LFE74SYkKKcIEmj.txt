This is the place where all the junkies go
Where time gets fast but everything gets slow

Can I get some Vaseline, step into a modern scene
Take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream
I don't want to do it like my Daddy did
I don't want to give it to my baby's kid

This is my calling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling, all I can do to you
Hammers are falling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling, all I can do to you

This is the place where all the devils plead
Their case to take from you what they need

Can I isolate your gene, can I kiss your dopamine
In a way I wonder if she's living in a magazine
I don't want to say it if it isn't so
I don't want to weigh it but I've got to know

This is my calling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling, all I can do to you
Hammers are falling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling, all I can do to you

I saw you out there yesterday
What did you want to say
A perfect piece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray
I caught you out there in the fray
What did you want to say
A masterpiece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray

Can I smell your gasoline, can I pet your wolverine
On the day my best friend died I could not get my copper clean
I don't want to take it up with Little Joe
I don't want to fake it but I've got to know

This is my calling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling, all I can do to you
Hammers are falling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling, all I can do to you

I'm a misfit, I'm born with all of it
The fucking ultimate of love inside the atom split
I'm in a flash ray a mash of DNA
Another poppin' Jay who thinks he's got something to say
