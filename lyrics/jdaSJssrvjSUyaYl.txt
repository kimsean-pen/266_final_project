Swollen Summer

Downtown in the shade
Staring at the sunshine in my face
Telling me to come and hide, come and play
I'm telling you the sun never goes away
And all I do is talk, talk, talk all day
I'm talking my life away
And I'm staring at the sun again
Till everything's fading

It's like a swollen summer
What if I'm getting dumber?
What if I'm just in denial?
What if they come and cop my style?

Downtown in the clear
All I know is nothing ever changes here
And I know there's no excuse and no defence
But my summer summer summertime never ends

And all I do is talk, talk, talk all day
I'm laughing my life away
And I'm staring at the sun again
Till everything's fading

It's like a swollen summer
What if I'm getting dumber?
What if I'm just in denial?
What if they come and cop my style?

It's like a swollen summer
What if I'm getting dumber?
What if I'm just in denial?
What if they come and cop my style?

Swollen summer
Swollen summer
Swollen summer
Swollen summer
Oh yeah
