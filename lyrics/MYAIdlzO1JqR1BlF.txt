on the brink of a new day
on the heels of something more
with the strength of a hundred hands
they're stronger than before

they say she'll grow out of it
their contemptuous and cool
in pursuit of happiness
they'll find a way

maybe we can just run away
maybe we can just run away
maybe we can just run away for good
cause were both misunderstood

on the brink of a new day
on the heels of something more
in the wake of a heavy hand
there's a new world to explore

they say shell grow out of it
their contemptuous and cool
in pursuit of happiness
we'll find a way

maybe we can just run away
maybe we can just run away
maybe we can leave this place for good
cause were both misunderstood

cause were both misunderstood

maybe we can just run away
maybe we can just run away
maybe we can leave this place for good
cause were both misunderstood

maybe we can just run away
maybe we can just run away
maybe we can leave this place for good
cause were both misunderstood
