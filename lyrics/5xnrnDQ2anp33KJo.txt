Methamphetamine, I'm dressed like a beauty queen
Two step pacing and I'm too intoxicated
Trying to break this down, wish you wouldn't stick around
I wanna make it home and I'd love to be alone
You annoy me like tick tick tick
You won't stop talking about defining this
And if it's the truth, I gotta say you're like a piece of real estate
You look real nice from the exterior, you're acting so inferior
You're trying to get me naked by getting me wasted
In truth, your conversation is actually sedating
I'm not drinking, I'm not buying, I'm not lying
It's not an investment, here is my two cents

Why you gotta get so caught up?
Overreacting all the time
Why you gotta get so caught up?
Let's take this day by day, we'll make it fine
Your complaining is suffocating
I'm not pulling away, I just don't like PDA
Why you gotta get so caught?

In the case of you and I, you would be the first to die
In the zombie apocalypse, you'd probably run and trip
I bet you'd lie there and complain that life's not fair
God I bet you're even boring while the zombies eat your brain
I told ya it's a two mile walk home
I may be fucked, but I can do it on my own
I like the time alone
All your yadda yadda in my head
Is making me wish the zombies were really here

So, why you gotta get so caught up?
Overreacting all the time
Why you gotta get so caught up?
Let's take this day by day, we'll make it fine
Your complaining is suffocating
I'm not pulling away, God, we've only had three dates
Why you gotta get so caught?

I understand you really wanna make this work
And I don't have the excuse that you're an absolute jerk
I understand you really wanna make this work
And I don't have the excuse that you're an absolute jerk
I understand you really wanna make this work
And I don't have the excuse that you're an absolute jerk
I understand you really wanna make this work
And I don't have the excuse that you're an absolute jerk

Why you gotta get so caught up?
Overreacting all the time
Why you gotta get so caught up?
Let's take this day by day we'll make it fine
Your complaining is suffocating
I'm not pulling away, I just don't like PDA
Why you gotta get so caught?
Why you gotta get so caught up?

I understand you really wanna make this work
And I don't have the excuse that you're an absolute jerk
I understand you really wanna make this work
And I don't have the excuse that you're an absolute jerk
