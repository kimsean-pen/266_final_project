You could move to Austin
Or the dark side of the moon
You could change your number
I'd try every combination 'til I got to you

Say goodbye, you could try
You could drive down that drive
But that don't mean you're leaving

There ain't no town far enough
Ain't no door slammed hard enough
There ain't no room dark enough
Where I can't see your memory
There ain't no drink strong enough
There ain't no year long enough
There ain't no gone gone enough
Gone enough for you and me

So go on say that you don't love me
But your eyes say what you mean
Go off, get married to somebody else
But it'll only be a ring

I could get amnesia
I'd see ya, I'd need ya
I'd still hold you in my dreams

There ain't no town far enough
Ain't no door slammed hard enough
There ain't no room dark enough
Where I can't see your memory
There ain't no drink strong enough
There ain't no year long enough
There ain't no gone gone enough
Gone enough for you and me

Say goodbye, you could try
You could drive down that drive
But that don't mean you're leaving

No there ain't no town far enough
Ain't no door slammed hard enough
There ain't no room dark enough
Where I can't see your memory
There ain't no drink strong enough
There ain't no year long enough
There ain't no gone gone enough
Gone enough for you and me

You could move to Austin
Yeah go on say that you don't love me
No there ain't no gone gone enough
For you and me
