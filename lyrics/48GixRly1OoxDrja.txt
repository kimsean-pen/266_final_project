Who deserves greatness deserves their hate,
for they are no surer than the hailstone in the sun
where he should find them brave,
where he should find them lions
he find them hares for like hares they run
what darker light could one soul bring,
why should his pride have no single sting?
the last of kind no witness to his grief,
their words are empty a soldiers life being brief
now here's the truth of it,
the oath is broken, all allgianes,
even promises unspoken
to peck the eagles they brought in the crows,
has Rome ever known the value of her own
what darker light could one soul bring,
why should his pride have no single sting?
the last of kind no witness to his grief,
their words are empty a soldiers life being brief
now here's the truth of it, the oath is broken,
all allgianes,
even promises unspoken will die broken within him
for your voices I have fought
watched for your voices
for your voices hear wounds
battels won for your voices
