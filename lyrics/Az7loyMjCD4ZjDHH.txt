I'm walking all by myself
Well, I was talking
To myself about you
What am I gonna do?

I was singing this song about you
I was speaking about singing
This song for you

The more I think about it
The more I know it's true
The more I think about it
The more I'm sure it's you

Honey, I think you're just right
You're just right

I was walking
Like I said by myself
I was talking
To myself about you
Like I always do

The more I think about it
The more I know it's true
The more I think about it
The more I'm sure it's you

Honey, I think you're just right
You're just right

The more I think about it
The more I know it's true
The more I think about it
The more I'm sure it's you

Honey, I think you're just right
You're just right
