I know it's a little old-fashioned
Holding hands, now start your romancin'
Show me all your flaws
Show me your bear claws
Go rip your heart out tonight

You don't have to be cool to make me shiver
Look in my eyes, can I make this any clearer?

Just a late-night girl, calling through a phone
She never really loved you so just leave her alone
Your mama says it's over when you come through the door
Saying "That's enough of you now, won't you shut your mouth?"

Ay! Oh!
I'll never let you go
Ay! Oh!
I'll never let you go

You say goodbye as if you're leaving on a plane
You've seen the clouds and how the shapes are so strange
And not the boy in the backseat, staying in the backseat
Tryin' to make sense of it all

He's saying, "We were such a good thing, we were such a good thing
How could you let this fall?"
Take all my money and meet me on the sidewalk
If you don't show then I'll know

Just a late-night girl, calling through a phone
She never really loved you so just leave her alone
Your mama says it's over when you come through the door
Saying "That's enough of you now won't you shut your mouth?"

Ay! Oh!
I'll never let you go
Ay! Oh!
I'll never let you go

Show me all your flaws, show me your bear claws
Go rip your heart out tonight

You were just a late-night girl, calling through a phone
She never really loved you so just leave her alone
Your mama says it's over when you come through the door
Saying "That's enough of you now won't you shut your mouth?"
"That's enough of you, kid, now you're going South, love"

Ay! Oh!
I'll never let you go
Ay! Oh!
I'll never let you go
Ay! Oh! (Show me all your flaws)
I'll never let you go
Ay! Oh! (Show me all your flaws)
I'll never let you go
