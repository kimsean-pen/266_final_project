Approaching a silence, a blur of subsidence
Time may heal all troubles, is that what Ive found?
Joy entices all, until deaths lonely shroud
But I know its forever...
Praying for a change
Our lives leading onwards, the essence is stronger
Memories of life drifting further away I must doubt that where
Theres a will theres a way...
But I know, its forever
Life is all the pain we endeavour
