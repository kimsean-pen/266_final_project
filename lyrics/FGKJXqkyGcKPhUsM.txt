I keep walking, walking these cold city streets
Reliving all the wrong you've done to me
I look for some dark alleyway where I can hide
Don't want no stranger oh to see me cry

I keep searching this world
For someone to hold me
Like you used to hold me
But there's no good place for the lonely

Oh, one thing I found out about these memories
Sometimes they are sad even when they're sweet
Every time a good thing has turned out to be bad
It might be the best thing, baby, you're gonna ever have

I keep searching this world
For someone to hold me
Like you used to hold me
But there's no good place for the lonely

I don't know where I go from here
Cause every day, baby, it's a little more clear
No one's ever gonna know me like you know me
But there's no good place for the lonely

I've been through the boss and I've got all the scars
Prove how hard love can be, beyond love
I keep searching this world
For someone to hold me
Like you used to hold me
But there's no good place for the lonely
Cause this place is no good for the lonely
