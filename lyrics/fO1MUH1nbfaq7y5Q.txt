Ooh ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh

Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said: Sonny, move out to the country
Oh, been workin' too hard can give you
A heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack
You oughta know by now (You oughta know by now)
Who needs a house out in Hackensack
Is that all you get with your money

And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
Oh, movin' out

Ooh ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh

Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mister Cacciatore's down on Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
Oh, he's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac-ac-ac-ac-ac-ac
You oughta know by now (You oughta know by now)
And if he can't drive
With a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders

And if that's what you've heard him by
And if that's what it's all about
Mama if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
Oh, movin' out

Ooh ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh

You should never argue with a crazy mind-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi
You oughta know by now (You oughta know by now)
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money

And it seems such a waste of time
And when that's what it's all about
Mama if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
Oh oh, movin' out, haha

Ooh ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh

Oh, moving out
Oh yeah
Oh, moving out
Oh yeah
Oh ooh

What's that?
