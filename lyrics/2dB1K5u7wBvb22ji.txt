Standing on the world outside
Caught up in a love landslide
Stuck still, color blind
Hoping for a black and white

Are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna be mine?
I feel it falling from the skies above
Are you gonna be mine?

My wave, my shark, my demon in the dark
The blue tide pulling me under
Or are you my soul, my heart, pull everything apart?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?

Walking on the clouds unknown
Drop down, oh, I will never go, never go, never go
Floating like gravity has grown
Reach down to a deep, deep hole, deep hole, deep, deep hole

Are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna be mine?
I feel it falling from the skies above
Are you gonna be mine?

My wave, my shark, my demon in the dark
The blue tide pulling me under
Or are you my soul, my heart, pull everything apart?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Oh oh ohh, are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?

Standing on the world outside
I'm a shark in a love landslide
