You can take the money, you can take the ride
you can take it all but never get inside
you can't take my honor, you can't take my soul
you can't take the fact
you'll never have control
You won't break me

no matter how hard you try
you can't shake me down
I'm fucking bulletproof
All I've learned, its like poison

all I've done, inside my veins
all I've seen, its like venom
all I know, it's all that remains
You can keep the fortune, and

you can have the fame
you can have the shit you never will obtain
you can't take my virute, no
you can't take my pride
you can't take the anger building up inside
You won't break me

no matter how hard you try
you can't shake me down
I'm fucking bulletproof
All I've learned, its like poison

all I've done, inside my veins
all I've seen, its like venom
all I know, it's all that remains
You won't break me

no matter how hard you try
you can't shake me down
I'm fucking bulletproof
All I've learned, its like poison

all I've done, inside my veins
all I've seen, its like venom
all I know, it's all that remains
All I've learned, its like poison
all I've done, inside my veins
all I've seen, its like venom
all I know, it's all that remains
