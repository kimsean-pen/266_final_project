Tell me all the dreams that you have let
Slip right through your hands
Do you feel lost inside of someone else's life?

And we're not gonna live forever
Can you tell me is it now or never?
I'm not gonna make up your mind

I don't wanna live without you
And I don't wanna live a lie
We'll never know 'til we try
Yeah, we'll never know 'til we try

Failure is the only way to learn
'Til you've come undone
The rest will never find out what they might have been

And we're not gonna live forever
Can you tell me is it now or never?
I'm not gonna make up your mind

I don't wanna live without you
And I don't wanna live a lie
We'll never know 'til we try
Yeah, we'll never know 'til we try

So don't tell me sometime
Just where did we go wrong?

And we're not gonna live forever
Can you tell me is it now or never?
I'm not gonna make up your mind

I don't wanna live without you
And I don't wanna live a lie
We'll never know 'til we try
Yeah, we'll never know 'til we try
