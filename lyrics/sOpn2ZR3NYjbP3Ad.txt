You'd love to be so far away
It's not a long way to go, it's gonna end in your pain
Greet open handed stranger
Create the turmoil, you're not sane
I want the last one to go to embers will revive,
So stay
You want to live a life time each and every day
You've struggled before, I swear to do it again
You've told it before till I, until I'm weakened and sore
Seek hallowed land
You'd love to see right through my veins
The pale reflection tells all, predominations sustain
Crawl over land or mountain in
sight the ultimate escape
A silhouette subsiding, enticed unable to relate
You want to live a lifetime each and every day
You've beckoned before, you'll never do it again
You've prayed before who are the prayers for
Seek hallowed land
Begone the fools that lead me - I need not to know
accept reclining spirit I need to endure
You try to live a lifetime each and every day
In this short time of promise, you're a memory...
