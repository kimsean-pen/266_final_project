Oh my my
Little white lies
I swear I'm gonna make it right
This time
It's not the radio
Turn it way down low
Telling me things I do not know I know

Tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies
Tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies

Now who's to blame

You used to be the same
Now you won't let me speak your name
What a shame
It's a suicide
Shut up and drive
We're never going to make the light
but it's all right

Tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies
Tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies

(repeat chorus)
