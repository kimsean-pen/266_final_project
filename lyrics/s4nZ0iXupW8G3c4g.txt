You caught my eye, so I brushed my own
Just a speck of silver light
Trapped on a peek, my fingertip
Just a speck of silver line
Just more to know you by
I've got glitter in my wounds
Diamonds glitter on my wounds

And I walk back from your house
Any silvering steWs
When I talk, your words fall out
You got silver on the edge
Like shining in the air
I've got glitter in my wounds
Diamonds glitter on my wounds

I once was yours, oh
Now it's mine

And I've got glitter in my wounds
Diamonds glitter on my wounds
Now I sparkle when I move
Diamonds glitter on my wounds
Once was yours, once was yours alone
Now it's mine
