I got a date with the night
Burning out my finger
Gonna catch the kids dry
Gonna walk on water
Buying out the fight
We're sweatin' in the winter
Both thighs squeeze tight

Choke choke choke
Choke choke choke
Choke choke choke
Choke choke choke
Choke choke choke
Choke choke choke

Don't tell me to fix her
Don't tell me to fix her
Well just take a bite
No hangin' no picture
Flyin' out my sight
Droppin' brides at the altar
Both thighs squeeze tight

Choke choke choke
Choke choke choke
Choke choke choke
Choke choke choke
Choke choke choke
Choke

I'll set you, I'll set it off
I'll set you, I'll set it off
I'll set you, I'll set it off
I'll set you, I'll set it off, ah ha!

I'll set you, I'll set it off
I'll set you, I'll set it off
I'll set you, I'll set it off
I'll set you, I'll set it off, ah ah!

Buying out the fight
Gonna walk on water
Gonna catch the kids dry
Gonna bend my finger
Flyin' out my sight
We're sweatin' in the winter
Both thighs squeeze tight
Both thighs squeeze tight
