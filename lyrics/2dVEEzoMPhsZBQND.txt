She colourblind tired eyes
Her hallway aching
She'll never move him - likes it that way
He's just a walker and he'll never stop walking away
It's not too soon he said
It's not too soon at all
You might as well be dead he said
If you're afraid to fall
I said -
I know her
She said -
Why do you stare so hard
Wrapped up like a doll in bad dreams and broken arms
Make these old bones shiver
It's not too soon he said
It's not too soon at all
You might as well be dead he said
If you're afraid to fall
I said -
I know her
The last time I saw you,
You were standing in the dark
And with a freezing face,
I watched you fall apart
It's not too soon he said
It's not too soon at all
You might as well be dead he said
If you're afraid to fall
I said,
done your time
been in your place
I couldn't look you in the face
and tell you that it turns me on
it makes my stomach turn
I know her
