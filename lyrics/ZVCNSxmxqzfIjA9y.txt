Follow me, love
Into tomorrow
We'll leave behind
Our pain and sorrow
We won't walk
With Pizzaro
Follow the man with the
Flaming arrow!

Come on love
I know you want to
Reclaim the streets
With the Berlin statue
We'll burn the streets
Regrow the forest
We'll rob the richest
Give to the poorest!

Come on love
Come on love

I don't need it
I don't wanna build another
I don't love it
I won't feel fight another

When the sun sets down
When the sun sets down
Gunpowder will wash the streets
With Indian blood
And the seeds of revolution
Will grow tight around our
Children's necks, like nooses,
That are used to keep the slaves
In check, in chains
And decades later
You still can't figure out why
It remains the same

Wake up love
I want some action
Unlock the children
They'll make it happen
But if comfort
Is your coffin
Then pull the lever and
Choose your killer!

I don't need it
I don't wanna build another
I don't need it
I won't feel fight another
I don't love it
I don't wanna build another
