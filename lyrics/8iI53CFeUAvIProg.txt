- And do you know what the press and everybody is gonna be asking?
- What?
- Who IS Danger Woman?!

If you've seen it once, you'll see it again
I told everyone and all of my friends
Well there she is and she's at it again
And I think it's all over and now:
(You're gonna get it!)

She's hanging off the chopper
And no one's gonna stop her
Don't try and call the doctor
'Cause she's jumpin' around now
Handle bar standing
And flying over canyons
No hands on the landing
Now we're rollin' around on the ground

If you could just believe what you can not see
Well that may be, she may as well be
Well there she is and she's at it again
And I think it's all over and now:
(You're gonna get it!)

She's hanging off the chopper
And nothing's gonna stop her
Don't even call the doctor
'Cause she's jumpin' around now
Handle bar standing
And flying over canyons
No hands on the landing
Now we're rollin' around on the ground

(I can hear her voice from miles away)
(Yo, ATL, where's she at?)
(Yo, yo, where she at, where she at, yo)

Woah, she's flying around in her head
(Danger Woman!)
Woah, Punishing what's left of the WWF

If that's what you want
That's what you get
You want Danger Woman
That's what you want
That's what you get
That's what you want,
You want Danger Woman

Well she's fighting a crime
That's all in her mind
At the Kareoke showdown
Don't try to understand her
The Phantom Highlander
The Songbird Avenger
It's Danger Woman!
