Do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do

I saw a spider, I didn't scream
'Cause, I can belch the alphabet just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I tape these suckers down, 'cause, they just get in my way (my way)

The way you look at me is kinda like a little sister (oh, oh)
Rubbed by your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters

So I don't wanna be one of the boys (don't wanna be, don't wanna be)
One of your guys (don't wanna be)
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be one of the girls (just wanna be)
Pretty in pearls and not one of the boys (just wanna be)

So over the summer something changed
I started reading Seventeen and shaving my legs
And I study Lolita religiously
And I walked right into school and caught you staring at me (oh, oh)

'Cause, I know what you know
But now you're gonna have to take a number (okay)
It's okay
Maybe one day but not until you give me my diamond ring

'Cause, I don't wanna be one of the boys (don't wanna be, don't wanna be)
One of your guys (don't wanna be)
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be your homecoming queen (just wanna be, just wanna be)
Pin-up poster dream and not one of the boys (just wanna be)

I wanna be a flower, not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses, not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day
You're gonna wanna make out, make out, make out with me
Don't wanna be (don't wanna be)
Don't wanna be (don't wanna be)
Don't wanna be (don't wanna be)

'Cause, I don't wanna be one of the boys (don't wanna be, don't wanna be)
One of your guys (don't wanna be)
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be one of the girls (just wanna be, just wanna be)
Pretty in pearls and not one of the boys (just wanna be)

Do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do
