Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Guess what?
If you caught one, you can catch another one
If you caught one, you can catch another one
If you caught one, you can catch another one
If you caught one, you can catch another one

I was fishin' for a real good man
Any second 'bout to reel one in
A little bait and I had one hooked
I threw him back, he was no good

Why you stressin' me boy
Blowin' up my line... are you testin' me boy
I ain't gonna give you the best of me boy
If gleaming is a crime, you arrestin' me boy
Let me be boy

Yeah I'm settin' sail for the deep blue sea
Cruisin' with my girls, got my anchor ready
I saw you jumpin' round and you caught my eye
Oh-oh-oh my, translate that!
He was super fine, one of a kind
And now he's makin' me sweat
My match has been met
He's playin' hard to get so I'm castin' my net
I hope it's worth the while, don't make me regret
Or else it's on to the next
Baby, you can get left, just step

Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Guess what?
If you caught one, you can catch another one
If you caught one, you can catch another one
If you caught one, you can catch another one
If you caught one, you can catch another one

I ain't trippin' cause I let one go
Cause I know that one will follow
Can't let a man pull me down
Stay afloat so I won't drown
Oh you rockin' my boat
Puttin' a fight cause I'm lettin' you go
Now you want to stay when you wanted to be free
Runnin' round town with a chick who ain't me
You're such a guppy

I know I'm a little fish in a big pond
Maybe time to cast my reel beyond
You had me fooled with your big game, now who's to blame
It turned out you were super lame, put me to shame
And now I gotta move upstream, to find the man of my dreams
The next one to add to my team
My baby checkin' out my line to see what I caught
And if you wanna go South to the sharks then you can get lost...

Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Guess what?
If you caught one, you can catch another one
If you caught one, you can catch another one
If you caught one, you can catch another one
If you caught one, you can catch another one

I used to cry over heartbreak when I didn't know better
One thing that my mama told me changed my life forever
She said, the main is a dime a dozen
Baby girl don't cry for nothin'
Little girl you should go and have fun
And if you caught one you can catch another one

Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Too many fish in the sea to miss one
Guess what?
If you caught one, you can catch another one
If you caught one, you can catch another one
If you caught one, you can catch another one
If you caught one, you can catch another one
