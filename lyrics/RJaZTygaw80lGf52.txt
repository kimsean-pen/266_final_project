Red eyes and tears no more for you my love I fear
Red eyes and tears no more for you my love I fear

No more fear, no more fear I'm in love
Losing sensation for you my love I fear
Losing sensation for you my love I fear
No more fear, no more fear I'm in love

Spoken: Love... love... I'm in love

Losing the reasons to breathe I never lived
I'm losing the reasons to breathe I never lived
Never lived, never lived I'm in love

These are my reasons the truth is never filled
These are my reasons the truth is never filled
I'm never filled, never filled I'm in love

Spoken: Love, love, I'm in love

Red eyes and tears no more for you my love I kill
Red eyes and tears no more for you my love I kill
Red eyes and tears
Red eyes and tears
Red eyes and tears no more for you my love I kill
No more kill, no more kill I'm in love
Spoken: Love, love, I'm in love
