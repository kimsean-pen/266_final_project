Never thought I'd feel again
Feel the darkness fade and see the morning sun arise
Never thought I'd feel alive again
Senses dull and blunt from all the lies

Now, when I hold your face so close to mine
I see a place where the sun will shine
With you it is divine

Looking down into those eyes
I know
I'll be lost and never found again
Kiss me once and I will surely melt and die
Kiss me twice and I will never leave your side
Dreams Come True

Do I dare to trust this time?
Ooh, the Bells of Fortune
will I ever hear them chime?
Only those who have been burned before
Truly know the meaning of Hell's flaming core

I was the brooding night and you were dawn
Saving me, for I was forlorn
In your light I am reborn

Looking down into those eyes
I know
I'll be lost and never found again
Kiss me once and I will surely melt and die
Kiss me twice and I will never leave your side
Dreams Come True

Then, when the walls are breaking down on us
When all we see is misery
Will you still believe in me?

Looking down into those eyes
I know
I'll be lost and never found again
Kiss me once and I will surely melt and die
Kiss me twice and I will never leave your side
Until the sign of winter (Dreams Come True)
Always by your side...
