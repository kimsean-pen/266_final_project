Welcome to the afterlife

Sitting by the river, I think I smell some rain
Silver puddles glitter behind the old jail
Wet snails get wetter, crawling towards perfume
The air silks like snow
Moth wings crumble by a day-lit fire
Ash of dead wood pile
Higher, pyre for false gods
Blazing mires

Welcome to the afterlife

Afternoon times, afterlife times
Twilight's best for Venus flytrap
Cloudless drops tear at my cheeks
Brusque speak a raven beak
Neon stars twinkle in the night
Sage smoke, rainbow, money signs

(Welcome to the afterlife)

Welcome to the afterlife
Welcome to the afterlife
Welcome to the afterlife
Welcome to the afterlife
