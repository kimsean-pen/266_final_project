There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly led me to you
Look at the sky it's the colour of love
There must have been an angel by my side

Something heavenly came down from above
He led me to you he led me to you
He built a bridge to your heart all the way
How many tons of love inside I can't say

When I was led to you I knew you were the one for me
I swear whole world could feel my heartbeat
When I lay eyes on you
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

You wrapped me up in the colour of love
You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
Kiss of life
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Ooh la-la umm

Wasn't it clear from the start look the sky is full of love
Yeah the sky is full of love
He built bridge to your heart
How many tons of love inside I can't say

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
Yeah-yeah oh yeah
You gave me the kiss that's like
Kiss of life

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life

Must have been an angel came down from above giving me love yeah
