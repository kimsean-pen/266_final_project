When I see your face
All of my worries
Dissipate from me
Dissipate from me
When I see your face
All of my worries
Dissipate from me
Disintegrate

When I was feeling the pressure
You know I'm feeling the pressure
When I'm feeling the pressure
You make me feel so much better

Sometimes I wake up in a bedroom
Walking into many brick walls
So many brick walls
So many brick walls
Sometimes I wake up in a bedroom
Sometimes I just stare into space
How big is this place?
How big is this place?

'Cause I'm feeling the pressure
You know I'm feeling the pressure
When I'm feeling the pressure
You make me feel so much better

'Cause I'm feeling the pressure
You know I'm feeling the pressure
When I'm feeling the pressure
You make me feel so much better
When I'm feeling the pressure
You make me feel so much better

I see your face
All of my worries
Dissipate from me
Dissipate
