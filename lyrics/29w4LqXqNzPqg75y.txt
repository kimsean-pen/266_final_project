Reaching out
Reaching out

Been talking to myself for several hours
And I keep on calling for a higher power
I put another song on this record player
Dance 'til I'm drunk on a midnight prayer
Reaching out, but nobody comes

The girl who everyone knew
Is now the one they look through
And oh-

Say another prayer for the lost and lonely
Reaching out
Don't look away, stay and watch me slowly
Give it up
I feel myself falling away in silence
Freaking out
I know I can't do this alone anymore
Won't you take my hand, 'cause we could be amazing

What good are my memories, if I'm by myself?
Jumping in the hallway, think I'm needing help
I had dreams, yeah I watched somebody
Television man seems to think it's funny
Reaching out, but nobody comes

The girl who everyone knew
Is now the one they look through
And oh-

Say another prayer for the lost and lonely
Reaching out
Don't look away, stay and watch me slowly
Give it up
I feel myself falling away in silence
Freaking out
I know I can't do this alone anymore
Won't you take my hand, 'cause we could be amazing

We could be amazing
Together we are strong
And I know there's more lovin' blood in these veins
So don't forget me, we're all connected
And no one needs to be alone

So say another prayer for the lost and lonely
Reaching out
Don't look away, stay and watch me slowly
Give it up
I feel myself falling away in silence
Freaking out
I know I can't do this alone anymore
Won't you take my hand, 'cause we could be amazing

Say another prayer for the lost and lonely
Reaching out
Don't look away, stay and watch me slowly
Give it up
I feel myself falling away in silence
Freaking out
I know I can't do this alone anymore
Won't you take my hand, 'cause we could be amazing

Reaching out
