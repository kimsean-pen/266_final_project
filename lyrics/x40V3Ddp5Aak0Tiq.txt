The world was on fire no-one could save me but you
Strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
I never dreamed that I'd loose somebody like you

No, I don't wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
With you
(This world is only gonna break your heart)

What a wicked game to play to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you

And I wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you

The world was on fire no-one could save me but you
Strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
I never dreamed that I'd loose somebody like you

No, I don't wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
(this world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
