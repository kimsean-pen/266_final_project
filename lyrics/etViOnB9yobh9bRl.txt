I'd give anything just to cut you free
I'd give blood just to watch you, just to watch you BLEED
I see through you and all your lies
You are everything that I despise
You won't take shit when you leave
What the hell do you want from me?
I'm over it, so over it

This is good bye
I'd give anything just to cut you free
I'd give blood just to make you, just to watch you bleed
I know you better than you do
I'm to fucking blame, so are you

It won't kill me to watch you leave
What the fuck do you want from me?
I'm over it, so over it
THIS IS GOOD BYE

I'd give anything just to cut you free
I'd give you blood just to make you, just to watch you BLEED
Just to make you, just to watch you
Just to make you, just to watch you BLEED
I'd give anything just to cut you free
I'd give blood just to make you, just to watch you BLEED
I'd give anything just to cut you free
I'd give blood just to make you, just to watch you BLEED
I'd give anything just to cut you free
I'd give you blood just to make you, just to watch you bleed
