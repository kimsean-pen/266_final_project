Open that door;
I'll follow you into that space
Where nothing is regretted then forgotten

Where is that grace that carries me out?
So strange it's mine
It's closed and locked
But If you open that door, it won't be

Yesterday when, before the days of collapsing,
And I'll stand through all these lines just to make it back to you
Can you help me every step of the way?
We can bury that battle and bury the cause
There is nothing that I can say because I was wrong this time

Everyone knows cause they see the glare in our eyes
Be Careful now, don't drown yourself in sorrow
I was the one that built that cross and weighed you down and now I'll carry on till it's over...
and it's over
