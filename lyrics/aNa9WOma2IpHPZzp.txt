We left so many lives behind
That grow like shadows in the past
We hoped for many flames, but saw them turn to ash
We've been born so many times
And died so many more
We went through misery
Is this what we are living for?

Forevermore we're in this together
Forever day and night
And we could reign forever
Forevermore making history together
Forever dark and light
Like this is the last day of our life
Forevermore

We survived so many fights
We were led astray
And yet, we're still alive
No deadlock we can't break
Will you be carried by the flames
When it's time to end the woe?
Or will you go with the ashes in the grey?

Forevermore we're in this together
Forever day and night
And we could reign forever
Forevermore making history together
Forever dark and light
Like this is the last day of our life
Forevermore

We'll be writing history with our visionary strength
We'll be writing history as peace will come at length
We'll be writing history with utopian ideas
We'll be writing history, we'll be living without fear

Forevermore we're in this together
Forever day and night
And we could reign forever
Forevermore making history together
Forever dark and light
Like this is the last day of our life
Forevermore

Like this is the last day of our life
Forevermore
