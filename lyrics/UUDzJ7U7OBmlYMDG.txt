Never woulda hitchhiked to Birmingham if it hadn't been for love
Never woulda caught the train to Louisian' if it hadn't been for love
Never woulda run through the blindin' rain without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love

Never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in if it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind if it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me: I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love

Four cold walls against my will
At least I know she's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord, have mercy on my soul

Never woulda gone to that side of town if it hadn't been for love
Never woulda took a mind to track her down if it hadn't been for love
Never woulda loaded up a forty four, put myself behind a jail house door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love

Four cold walls against my will
at least I know she's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord, have mercy on my soul

Never woulda hitch hiked to Birmingham if it hadn't been for love
Never woulda caught the train to Louisian' if it hadn't been for love
Never woulda loaded up a forty four, put myself behind a jail house door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
