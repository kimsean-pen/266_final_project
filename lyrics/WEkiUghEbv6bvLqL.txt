Life's like a road that you travel on
Where there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I loved you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hits
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down and back up again
You're in my blood I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
A road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
Gim'me, gim'me, gim'me, gim'me yeah
You're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
There was a distance between you and I
A misunderstanding once but now
We look it in the eye... ohh

There ain't no load that I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
A gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
A gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive ya' all night long
A gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah
