I've been feeling every second
Since she told me we were through
Been going hell for leather
'Cause there's fuck all else to do
And she stumbled through some problems
Said, "You're the only wrong in me"
But I've been missing something
Bring your body home to me

Am I wasting my time?
Oh, I'm tryna find any truth in between the lies
Am I wasting my time?
Replaying conversations running 'round in my mind

Didn't wanna be a love let go
Barely getting by on my own
Guess I'll always be holding on to something borrowed
Didn't wanna sing myself away
For long nights and the wasted days
Saying her name like something borrowed

I'm only getting older
Feeling sorry for myself
Been wondering who she's holding
Is playing havoc with my hell

Am I wasting my time?
Oh, I'm tryna find any truth in between the lies
Am I wasting my time?
Replaying conversations running 'round in my mind

Didn't wanna be a love let go
Barely getting by on my own
Guess I'll always be holding on to something borrowed
Didn't wanna sing myself away
For long nights and the wasted days
Saying her name like something borrowed

Be tough with your love when I'm talking too much
Be tough with your love, you've got to sober me up
Be tough with your love when I'm talking too much
Be tough with your love, you've got to sober me up

Didn't wanna be a love let go
Barely getting by on my own
Guess I'll always be holding on to something borrowed
Didn't wanna sing myself away
For long nights and the wasted days
Saying her name like something borrowed

Oh
And hold it
The kind of love
Like something borrowed
