Until we get by, I'm on your side
I'll be your shoulder
(I'll be your shoulder)
Through the rough water
(Through the rough water now)
Until we get by
('Til we get, 'til we get, 'til we get)
I'll fucking ride
('Til we get, 'til we get, 'til we get)
We can get through it
(We can get through it)
We gon' pull through it
(We gon' pull through it now)

Aye, when you're torn in two, I could be the glue
To the ends of earth, I will travel to
When you're afraid to cope, hesitate, I won't
When you need a light, I could fill the room

I'd be damned if I ever let you down, babe
Cushion blows like a feather in a shock wave
You know my love is never fake
My mind's already been made

Until we get by, I'm on your side
I'll be your shoulder
(I'll be your shoulder)
Through the rough water
(Through the rough water now)
Until we get by
('Til we get, 'til we get, 'til we get)
I'll fucking ride
('Til we get, 'til we get, 'til we get)
We can get through it
(We can get through it)
We gon' pull through it
(We gon' pull through it now)

Aye, you can call on me any time of day
I ain't even hang up, and I'm on my way
Don't be scared to lose, make a million mistakes
Got a pack of brews and some good movies

I'd be damned if I ever let you down, babe
Cushion blows like a feather in a shock wave
You know my love is never fake
My mind's already been made

Until we get by, I'm on your side
I'll be your shoulder
(I'll be your shoulder)
Through the rough water
(Through the rough water now)
Until we get by
('Til we get, 'til we get, 'til we get)
I'll fucking ride
('Til we get, 'til we get, 'til we get)
We can get through it
(We can get through it)
We gon' pull through it
(We gon' pull through it now)

So I get what you mean, it's a terrible thing to feel this way
Whatever happens, baby
Don't worry I'll be young, I'll listen when your torn
Get to the bottom of it, I know we'll solve it
So I get what you mean, it's a terrible thing to feel this way
Whatever happens, baby
Don't worry I'll be young, I'll listen when your torn
Get to the bottom of it

Until we get by, I'm on your side
I'll be your shoulder
(I'll be your shoulder)
Through the rough water
(Through the rough water now)
Until we get by
('Til we get, 'til we get, 'til we get)
I'll fucking ride

'Til we get by
'Til we get by
'Til we get by
