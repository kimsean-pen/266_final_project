Deep inside my heart and it's splintered at it's core
Molden curdle of milken puddle
Dreams of warm breasts settling in my mouth
Be my spouse, make a babe and a house
Apple tree, drunken brawl domestically
Dirty dog dusty-pawed bloody nose rose-embroidered sheets
Dangle like women in the breeze
On a line above the yard
And in my heart a flower dies slow
Like a campfire covered in piss, my love
Like snow falls
My love like a snow fall

Raphael you know just how
To take me in the swimming pool
Like a child being baptized
Beneath the starry sky we lie
Drowning in your watery thighs
Luscious eyes; you're a teenage player
In my heart an island sinks slow
Tears fall in the kitchen sink, O'h
Don't speak I can hear you
Don't speak I can hear you
