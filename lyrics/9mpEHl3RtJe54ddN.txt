If I got a day off, then it's date night
I've been saving this time, especially for you
That's our song on the radio
And I call when I'm tryna request it for you

Usually, I don't give in so quick, what you done to me?
All of the sad in the time, misses you when you're next to me
And I don't have to play it cool

'Cause I-I, I-I, I-I, I've been missin' on you
I-I, I-I, no, I've been M-I-A on you
I-I, I-I, I-I, I've been missin' on you
I-I, I-I, and I'm not tryna play it cool

If I got a day off, it's a date night
I've been saving this time, especially for you
And I picked a place we haven't been yet
I just gotta request a table for two

Usually, I don't give in so quick, what you done to me?
All of the sad in the time, misses you when you're next to me
And I don't have to play it cool

'Cause I-I, I-I, I-I, I've been missin' on you
I-I, I-I, no, I've been M-I-A on you
I-I, I-I, I-I, I've been missin' on you
I-I, I-I, and I'm not tryna play it cool

Me and you, entourage, you're my crew
Going for a while, coming back for a few
Let me make, make it all up to you
Gimme all your time, I can change your mood
You was right, I was wrong, I'm a fool
Now, I'm on my knees, baby, I'm in love with you
Let me make, make it all up to you
'Cause I be M-I-A on you

You, you-you, you, I be M-I-A on you
You, you-you, you, I be M-I-A on you
You, you-you, you, I be M-I-A on you
You, you-you, you

And I don't have to play it cool

'Cause I-I, I-I, I-I, I've been missin' on you
I-I, I-I, no, I've been M-I-A on you
I-I, I-I, I-I, I've been missin' on you
I-I, I-I, and I'm not tryna play it cool
