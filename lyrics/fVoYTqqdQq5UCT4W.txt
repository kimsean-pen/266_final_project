Tell me your secret
What you desire
I will still be there for you
And tell me you need it
Tell me something you're not
I will still be there for you

And say you believe it
All of your lies
Tell me you feel it
And don't compromise, oh no
I will still be there for you

Your light in my dreams
Light up my skin
You're so far away
You're holding it in
I'm looking around
Watching it spin
Got my world outside
It's changing
Something within

Tell me you'll reach it
Some of the time
What you're searching for
Cos the love that's around you
Gets you down
Kick you to the floor

So tell me you see it
With your own eyes
Tell me the sky is falling now
In your world
I will still be there for you

Your light in my dreams
Light up my skin
Waiting so long
Time to begin
I'm looking around
Watching it spin
Got my world outside
It's changing
Something within

So tell me the reasons
Show me the signs
Say you desire
Desire only now
In this world
It's our world

Your light in my dreams
Light up my skin
You're so far away
You're holding it in
I'm looking around
Watching it spin
Got my world outside
It's changing
Something within

It's our world
Time moves on
And time moves on
In our world
