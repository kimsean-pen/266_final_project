Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be somethin' in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Layin' underneath the palm trees
(Undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek (At us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be fallin' in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it one lock
West-coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Sex on the beach
We've got white sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be fallin' in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it one lock
West-coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Toned, tanned, fit, and ready
Turn it up 'cause it's gettin' heavy
Wild, wild west-coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns
The girl's a freak, she drive a Jeep
And live on the Beach
I'm okay, I won't play, I love the bay
Just like I love L.A.
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everyday
Homeboys bangin' out
All that ass hangin' out
Bikinis, zuchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just a king and a queenie
Katy, my lady? (Yeah?)
Looky here, baby (Uh-huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representin' California (Ooh, ooh)

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it one lock
West-coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

West Coast, West Coast, aye aye!
(California, California girls)
California girls man
Hahahaha (California)
I really wish you all could be California girls
(California girls)
