Staying up late, don't hesitate
You ain't got no work at this rate
Minimum wage, you ain't got paid
Going out every night, can't get laid

And you can do what you want to, all night
You can do what you want to

Ain't he sad, grow up, we're getting older
Fall down, going drinking October
I'm bolder, drinking c-c-corona
Red jeans, no life on my shoulder

Do you want that, does it sound good?
This is how we do things in my hood
And you can come if you want to, all night
You can do what you want to
And you can do what toy want to, all night
You can do what you want to
You can do what you want to, all night
You can do what you want to
And you can do what you asked for, all night
You can do what you want to
