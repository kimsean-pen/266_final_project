Staring up into the solar system
All the stars are fixed up into the sky
I just want to sparkle for a moment
Before i just fizzle up and die

I'm happy because I'm stupid
Scared of spiders, scared of flying
If i wasn't so happy
I wouldnt be so scared of dying

So just be gentle with me
I'm not as young as I was
And I'll be gentle with you
I'm not as brave as I thought
Cos my heart gets broken so easily
So just be gentle, be gentle with me

Wide awake, waiting like a target
Listening for things I cannot see
Insects flutter up against my window
I don't like the way they look at me

I guess I've always needed to be needed by someone
It's sickened but a feeling
Being under someone's thumb

So just be gentle with me
And if i am ever me
And I'll be gentle with you
I never mean to be me
Cos I want to be peaches off a cherry tree
So be gentle, be gentle, be gentle, be gentle with me
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

So just be gentle with me
Travelling so tired
And I'll be gentle with you
I just can't switch myself... off
When I want to so, I never do
Because I'm mental, be gentle, be gentle
Just be gentle, be gentle, be gentle

And I'll be gentle, be gentle, be gentle, be gentle with you
