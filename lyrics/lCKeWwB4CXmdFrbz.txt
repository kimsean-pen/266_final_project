Pulled in to meet you, windows down
Duct taped mirrors, exhaust pourin' out
Always late, never unwound
When will I learn to shut my mouth?

Guess I'm rough, rough around the edges
Honey I'm rough, rough around the edges

You find the beauty in the simple things
In desert sunsets and in movie scenes
I see the flaws and all the in-betweens
The past was cruel and it caught up with me

Guess I'm rough, rough around the edges
Honey I'm rough, rough around the edges

Curtains closed so I can sleep in late
Nothin' on the TV, but it always plays
Dirty dishes, buds in the ash try
Don't feel like pickin' up the damn phone today

I'm feelin' rough, rough around the edges
Honey I'm rough, rough around the edges

If I let you down, baby, don't take it too hard
When my mind becomes a question mark
When I want closure, then I get confused
Don't believe in much, but I believe in you

I'm just rough, rough around the edges
Honey I'm rough, rough around the edges
