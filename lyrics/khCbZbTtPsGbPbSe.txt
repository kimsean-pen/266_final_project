Children born and raised on a Sunday
Hearing what their leaders say
Singing along
A story missing to the
Ones who won't listen
All the words are left alone

But I've been running out
Fighting to stay above the line and
I can feel the Devil is close so

It's gonna follow me down
It's gonna follow me down (Gonna follow)

Last rites in a lost city
I can't fight for a life I've never known
Dark lights giving no pity
Last rites for a place I call my home

Fear is in the war for society
Hungry for the heresy
Never atone
A spark that glistens for the
Souls of a mission
Canonize this pile of stones
But I'm rebelling now
Fighting to save my only life and
I can feel the rapture is close so

It's gonna follow me down
It's gonna follow me down (Gonna follow)

Last rites in a lost city
I can't fight for a life I've never known
Dark lights giving no pity
Last rites for a place I call my home
Whoa, ooh whoa
Place I call my home
Whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Place I call my home!

Sanctus
Dominus
I am left alone

Last rites in a lost city
I can't fight for a life I've never known
Dark lights giving no pity
Last rites for a place I call my home
Whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Place I call my home
Whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Place I call my home.
