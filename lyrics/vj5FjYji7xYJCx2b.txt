Pulled aside as if I was the wrong one,
You said it all and you made me the lost one.
Elevated by your greatest mistake, now I'm all alone.
I bet you couldn't tell that I felt the same way,
Struggling just to get to the next day.
I'm not force fed lies while I'm by your side.
Shaking your head doesn't change this.
Preparing myself for a train wreck,
I can't be saved.
So tell me why can't you see
This is where you need to be?
You know, it's taken its toll on me,
But I don't feel invisible, whoa.
So tell me why can't you see
This is where you need to be?
You know, it's taken its toll on me,
So I'll hope for a miracle.
Yeah, I'll hope for a miracle.
Holidays tend to make me feel whole again.
Rainy days make me feel like the dream is dead.
I can show you what it's like to be down when you're all alone.
I'm quite aligned to your design.
What's mine is yours, and that's just fine.
I'm finally acquiring the state of mind that everything is gonna be alright.
Shaking your head doesn't change this.
Preparing myself for a train wreck,
I can't be saved.
So tell me why can't you see
This is where you need to be?
You know, it's taken its toll on me,
But I don't feel invisible, whoa.
So tell me why can't you see
This is where you need to be?
You know, it's taken its toll on me,
So I'll hope for a miracle.
Yeah, I'll hope for a miracle.
And if you want to be free,
I can't be the one to make you believe.
You've still got this promise to keep.
Step back and wash away the reckless intentions.
They're leaving me breathless.
Find a way to stay in your skin.
So tell me why can't you see
This is where you need to be?
You know, it's taken its toll on me,
But I don't feel invisible.
