One evening of pourin' booze
An eventide of hooch
He'd always say, "That pick-me-up
bone knocked me down."
Soakin' in the dark
Dragged him to a desperate day
That dirty girl led him drunk away
And then his oats from the night before
Came up with the sun

Bad days had been
but not like this
Lost in a daze (Vaneo mayonnaise)
Momming bed no good
And then his oats from the night before
Came up with the sun

This time he had a better idea
this time he had a clue
he had a precedent this time
this time he knew what to do

That dirty girl led him drunk away
and left him in the sewer
it was right there at that then time
he knew he should never have screwed her
