Psycho, go, go
Psycho, go, go, go
Psycho, here we go

You push until I break
And the anger turns to rage
Why can't you just leave me alone
Got your finger on the trigger
You think that you're the winner
You're gonna get kicked off of your throne

You think you're gonna hurt me
Get ready to get dirty
You created this beast inside
Pull the noose tighter
And lift a little higher
Because you're killing me slow
I ain't ready to die
Killing me slow but I ain't ready to die
Tonight, get ready for a fight
So now you know it's time
To ride my circus for a psycho
Round and round we go, look out below
Because I want off this
I want off this
Circus for a psycho
(Psycho, go, go, go)
Circus for a psycho
(Psycho, here we go)

Psycho, here we go
Everybody down
Gonna burn it to the ground
Can't keep this beast inside
Never again, never again
You're killing me slow but I ain't ready to die
Killing me slow but I ain't ready to die
Tonight, get ready for a fight
So now you know it's time
To ride my circus for a psycho
Round and round we go, look out below
Because I want off this
I want off this
Circus for a psycho
(Psycho, go, go, go)
Circus for a psycho
(Psycho, here we go)

You think you're gonna hurt me
Get ready to get dirty
Gonna burn this place to the ground
Tonight, get ready for a fight
So now you know it's time
To ride my circus for a psycho
Round and round we go, look out below
It's time to ride my circus for a psycho
Never again, never again
You're killing me slow but I ain't ready to die
Round and round we go, look below
Because I want off this
I want off this
Circus for a psycho
(Psycho, go, go, go)
Circus for a psycho
(Psycho, here we go)
Circus for a psycho
Circus for a psycho
(Psycho, here we go)
