I can't help myself
Holding on to anybody
You came into the light
I'll stay strong dependent on it

Tried to love you like you love you
And I can't blame myself
Moving on I know too many lies
Why all the lies?
And I'm taking it as a sign

Can you tell me what it feels like?
Won't give myself to anyone
Can you tell me how we get it right?
Won't give myself just to anybody
I believe in ecstasy
But you might never love me
So can you tell me how we get it right?
I've got to be cautious

You can't help yourself
Holding on too many bodies
I came in to the light
Only you you don't believe me

Tried to love you like you love you
Tried to love you right
And I just can't take that
Lies, why all the lies?
And I'm taking it as a sign

Can you tell me what it feels like?
Won't give myself to anyone
Can you tell me how we get it right?
Won't give myself just to anybody
I believe in ecstasy
But you might never love me
So can you tell me how we get it right?
I've got to be cautious

And the fear of being alone is on your mind
When I say it isn't enough
I'll tell you why
The wrong direction of love
Will change your mind
And I'm taking it as a sign

Can you tell me what it feels like?
Won't give myself to anyone
Can you tell me how we get it right?
Won't give myself just to anybody
I believe in ecstasy
But you might never love me
So can you tell me how we get it right?
I've got to be cautious

Can you tell me what it feels like?
(I'm telling you, I'm telling you whoa whoa)
Can you tell me how we get it right?
(Tell me what it feels like, baby)
And I believe in ecstasy
But you might never love me
So can you tell me how we get it right?
I've got to be cautious
