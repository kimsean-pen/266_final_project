I don't want no ice cream love
That's too cold for me, little girl
I don't want no ice cream love
Girl, can't you see
I want a love that's warmer
Than the summer sunshine
I want a love that's as warm as mine
Because my love is warmer
Than a chocolate fudge
Because my love is warmer
Than a chocolate fudge
And that is why
I don't want no ice cream love
It is too cold for me, girl
I don't want no ice cream love
It's too cold, can't you see, little girl
I don't want no ice cream love
It's too cold for me
Love in the winter should
Be warmer than the summer sun
But if you're giving me
A ice cream love, little girl, that's no fun
And that is why I say
Because my love is warmer
Than a chocolate fudge
I say my love is warmer
Than a chocolate fudge
