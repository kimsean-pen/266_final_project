Is this really me, ha, in the mirror I see, staring back at me?
Could it be a new reflection of a woman complete?

All of a sudden I'm so carefree, yeah, well, alright
Your love is doing something strange to me, well, alright
Got a new flame, ha, haven't been the same
Something in me's changed, rearranged and I feel that I've been saved

You got me feeling
Like you're that something I've been missing
Everything's heaven
'Cause life with you has been a blessing

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Your love has brought me to a higher place, oh yeah

Who knew? Who knew?

Everyday, I'm amazed
And it makes me wanna get down and pray, pray, pray

Made some mistakes but that's in the past, well alright
I'm professing here to you, proof that I am through
I'm coming clean, now I can breathe and I finally believe, yeah

You got me thinking
I'll be alright, and you're the reason
Ooh, I can feel it
We're moving in a new direction

Where would I be, where would I be
Without you by my side?
Where would I be? Where would I be?
Without you standing by?
