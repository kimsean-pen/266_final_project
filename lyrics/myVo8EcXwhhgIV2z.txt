I am talking to you before we go under
Can you make this quieter if we could talk this through?
Like fines and twine[?] to reach satisfaction
And girl I witness trying to chase the light

Travel the world together
Let me take you away with me
Travel the world together
We can go places we've never been

The girl swap me up, tell me I'm crazy
Like where I am now you other one I lost
I gave you my time, my finest hour
My sweetheart come back please don't push me away

Travel the world together
Let me take you away with me
Travel the world together
We can go places we've never been

Travel the world together
Let me take you away with me
Travel the world together
We can go places we've never been
