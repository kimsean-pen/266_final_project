For every person I've tried to be,
There's another ten inside.
I love you so much I'm never there,
I'm always with you but never cared.
And you move in a hostile way,
Like you're recently wounded.
I reach for your wrists to feel the pulse,
They're feeling yourself for both of us.
We got a problem, it's plain to see.
We got a problem.

Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We're both schizophrenic I fear.
Say how many voices you hear?
Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We are schizophrenic, don't stop.
No, not till I fuck this all up.

All the searching we do inside,
Is a futile attempt to,
To sift what we're meant to never know,
It's all screwed up how the river flows.
And I know that you tried to hide,
To senter yourself but,
Was I the beast that sucked into you,
A real dark victim inside of you?
We got a problem, it's plain to see.
Bitch we got a problem.

Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We're both schizophrenic I fear.
Say how many voices you hear?
Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We are schizophrenic, don't stop.
No, not till I fuck this all up.

Nice to fucking meet you, and you!
And this is me, and me!
Bitch, we got a problem!

Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We're both schizophrenic I fear.
Say how many voices you hear?
Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We are schizophrenic, don't stop.
No, not till I fuck this all up.

Bitch we got a problem!
Yeah we got a problem!
Bitch we got a problem!
We got a problem!
We got a problem!
Yes bitch we got a problem!
We got a problem!
We got a problem!
