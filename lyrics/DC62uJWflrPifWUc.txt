We've heard the sound that ears bleed to hear
The sound of a place the entire universe awaits

Here the strongest fall to their knees
A passion so powerful
That walls crumble to their foundations

Here the strongest fall to their knees
The lost find their way back home
Here the strongest fall to their knees
The lost find their way back home

But the masses buy what will make them rich
Feasting on lies, chasing their tails
Truth be told, they'll get what they were promised

Crawling away, burning with regret
To the deepest, darkest depths
Crawling away, burning with regret
To the deepest, darkest depths of hell

We got news for you, we got news for you, the day is soon coming
When turning your back won't be an option
We got news for you, the day is soon coming
When turning your back won't be an option

Keep telling yourself what you really don't believe
You can compromise what you know to be true
And you can turn off all of your senses
But in the end you'll see, but in the end you'll see

Nothing stands between a man and his Maker
Nothing stands between a man and his Maker

No

No matter what is your decision
No matter what is your decision
This isn't something you could do alone
Go
No matter what, it's your decision
Give up, give in
Give up, give in no matter what, it's your decision
Give up, give in no matter what, it's your decision
Give up, give in no matter what, it's your decision
Give up, give in no matter what, it's your decision
