The same again, another disagreement
You dreamed of scenes like you read of in magazines
A new romance, invented in the bedroom
Is this so private, our struggle in the bedroom?

Is this really the way it is?
Or a contract in our mutual interest?

The same again, another disappointment
We couldn't perform in the way the other wanted
These social dreams put in practise in the bedroom
Is this so private, our struggle in the bedroom?

Is this really the way it is?
Or a contract in our mutual interest?

Our bodies make us worry
Our bodies make us worry
Our bodies make us worry
Our bodies make us worry

Is this really the way it is?
Or a contract in our mutual interest?
Is this really the way it is?
Or a contract in our mutual interest?
