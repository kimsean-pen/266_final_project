Lighted up, spotted out
All the barriers denied
Trade it in, fade the spot
Tracked it down to the hidden believers
At the start nobody saw
You didn't care at all
Can't get it out of me

All the senses are numb
On the spot paralysed
I got 99 problems but your hate ain't one
All the traitors, invaders, with bitter accusations
They wait for my fate
You can try but you can't break me down

I never said I can sit in silence (in silence)
You cannot blame me for never trying

See the inferno rise

I'am not scared of the things you do
When you go down i go down with you
We can go crazy inside and then we deny

INFERNO

We cannot get everything we need
The inferno is what we feed
When you give it to me
It's all that I need

INFERNO

All the hate and the lies
And the problems that you find
And the fights you make up, make you feel
Just the little bit better
Don't need to see at all
Pride before the fall
Strengthen inside of me

If the curtain goes down
And I reach the divide
I got 99 reasons why I won't back down
I won't fake it, to make it
No force will ever shake it
I wait for my fate
Because what goes around, comes around

You never thought I would sit in silence
But you commend me for even trying

See the inferno rise

I'am not scared of the things you do
When you go down i go down with you
We can go crazy inside and then we deny

INFERNO

We cannot get everything we need
The inferno is what we feed
When you give it to me
It's all that I need

INFERNO

Beging to climb, I see the pinnacle
I can suddenly feel that I was in denial
As I transform into the mythical
From the ashes, I see the inferno rise

I never said I can sit in silence (in silence)
You cannot blame me for never trying

See the inferno rise

I'am not scared of the things you do
When you go down i go down with you
We can go crazy inside and then we deny

INFERNO

We cannot get everything we need
The inferno is what we feed
When you give it to me
It's all that I need

INFERNO
