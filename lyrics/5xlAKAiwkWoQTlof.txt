baby you hurt me
and i know that i've hurt you

we've both promised
to always be true

we'd let our love
get lost in the rain

now we are waiting
Oh for love to live again
Holding on
To what was before
Oh lord i see
Why did we have to let it go
Now the only thing
That i know
The only thing
That i think i'd know
When the hurt is over
Lord, maybe love will flow

Trying to do
What we know we must
When you love somebody
You know you got to trust
I think about it
again and again
I say that i will baby
Oh but i don't know if i can
You say you're sorry
Oh i say i am too
then we turn round and round
then again we'd be untrue
that is why, that is why, the only thing
that i know
the only thing baby
that i know
when the hurt is over, baby
maybe love will flow

Guess by chance
We'd work things out
we both will know
what love is all about
don't move so quickly
Oh it don't move too fast
if you got a good love
Oh you ought to try to make it last
i know i hurt you
lord you broke my heart
and now we are sad baby
because our love is apart
that is why i say to you, the only thing
that i know
the only thing baby, i think i know
Oh baby
When the hurt is over
Lord maybe love will flow

I said when the hurt is over, baby
And all the pain is gone

Maybe i will learn how to love again y'all

When the hurt is over, over
Lord when all the pain is gone
