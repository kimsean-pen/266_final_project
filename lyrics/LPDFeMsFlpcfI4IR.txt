Hold my hand
I'll lead you to a place that you once dreamt
Promise land
Waiting for the light to blink

Living for the night
Lights out
We'll dance into tomorrow
Living for the night
Lights out
We'll cast an endless shadow

Come with me
We'll march and let the moonlight lead the way
Fade away
Waiting for the night to sink

Living for the night
Lights out
We'll dance into tomorrow
Living for the night
Lights out
We'll cast an endless shadow

I'm here the night is calling
I'm here the stars are falling
Low low low...

Living for the night
Lights out
We'll dance into tomorrow
Living for the night
Lights out
We'll cast an endless shadow
