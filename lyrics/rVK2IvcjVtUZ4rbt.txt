No one makes a loop around me
No one 'round here makes a decision
No one makes a loop around me
Everybody's trying to leave
Millions left this place before us
Now we're all trying to leave also
Restless angels fall on a slide
Leading to the doom that's before them
I have seen that feelings can't wait
To arise
Icicles are flames in this city
Everything is what it is not
Each thing diametrically opposed to itself
I can't wait for life
