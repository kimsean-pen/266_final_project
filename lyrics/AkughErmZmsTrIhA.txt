You're not that strong
Putting everything to lose
And losing all doesn't mean
Any harm to you

Dark days no more
Moonlight healing

You always want
But he don't really care
And you can't control yourself

He never wants
But you don't really care
And he can't control himself

Dark days no more
Moonlight healing

Into the night

You always want
But he don't really care
And you can't control yourself

He never wants
But you don't really care
And he can't control himself
