I won't even miss you 4x

I'm so light now, thank you
I would wake up heavy with your anchor
tied around my ankle
I threw it away with your letters on the table

That pipe my neighbors would bang on,
crumbs on the blanket I lay on
Black on the soles of my feet,
don't act like you don't know what I mean
I'll rinse out the cup in the morning,
pins in my bun that annoy me
I let the rose you buy wilt,
one more part of you that I killed

You take a walk and don't knock,
I won't even miss you
Back off I'm changing my locks,
I won't even miss you
Don't call your number's on block,
I won't even miss you
Cause I won't even miss you
Hop off, get off of my cloud,
I won't even miss you
Wave flags and throw in that towel,
I won't even miss you
You're only slowing me down,
I won't even miss you
And I won't even miss you

I won't even miss you 4x

You're gone so long before I wake up,
tuck the letter in the bag where I keep all of my makeup
Pillows you caused all my tearstains on,
I'ma get another one of these days so take 'em

That pipe my neighbors would bang on,
crumbs on the blanket I lay on
Black on the soles of my feet,
don't act like you don't know what I mean

I'll rinse out the cup in the morning,
pins in my bun that annoy me
I let the rose you buy wilt,
one more part of you that I killed

I won't
I won't even
I won't
And I won't even miss you

That pipe my neighbors would bang on,
crumbs on the blanket I lay on
Black on the soles of my feet,
don't act like you don't know what I mean
I'll rinse out the cup in the morning,
pins in my bun that annoy me
I let the rose you buy wilt,
one more part of you that I killed

You take a walk and don't knock,
I won't even miss you
Back off I'm changing my locks,
I won't even miss you
Don't call your number's on block,
I won't even miss you
Cause I won't even miss you
Hop off, get off of my cloud,
I won't even miss you
Wave flags and throw in that towel,
I won't even miss you
You're only slowing me down,
I won't even miss you
And I won't even miss you
I won't even miss you
cuz I won't even miss you
I won't even miss you
cuz I won't even miss you
