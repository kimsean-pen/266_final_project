What's all that commotion going on?
The boy in the back on his second attack
He wants his baby back
He wants his baby back

What's all that commotion that you hear?
The girl in the back who was doing the quake
Got a belly ache
She can't concentrate

Pick up the beat, you can move like you're made out of vapor
"Catch me if you can," is what she said with her hands
Come on and take me back
Can you take her back?

When she gives you the beat, you got to shine
The world slows down, and she stops on a dime
Got her number when you close your eyes, like a real magician

Still she knows, she'll never lose a thing
She can put you up on a shelf until she wants to pull the string

Still you know, she'll never slip away
Keep time in your head, counting in your head

Slow motion
I can play with time
I can keep today, but tomorrow's fine
Stop and look at the pictures, rolling in your head

Slow motion
You can play with time
You can leave it today, but tomorrows fine
Stop reliving your dreams at night, rolling in your bed

Still you know she'll never slip away
Keep time in your head, counting in your head

Slow motion
You can stop on a dime
Slow motion
You ought to try it sometime

Take me back on another track
Take me back Take me back

Slow motion,
You can pick up the beat
Slow motion
You can stop on the street

Take me back on another track
Take me back, take me back

Slow motion
You can stop on a dime
Slow motion
You ought to try it sometime

Take me back on another track
Take me back, take me back

Slow motion
You can pick up the beat
Slow motion
You can stop on the street
