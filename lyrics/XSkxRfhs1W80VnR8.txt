Listen to my Bluebird laugh
She can't tell you why
Deep within her heart, you see
She knows only cryin'
Just crying, yeah

There she sits, aloft a perch
Strangest color blue
Flying is forgotten now
Thinks only of you
Just you
Oh, yeah

So, get all those blues, must be a thousand hues
And each just differently used, you just know
You sit there mesmerized by the depth of her eyes
That you can't categorize
She got soul
She got soul
She got soul
She got soul

Do you think she loves you?
Do you think at all?

Soon she's goin' to fly away
Sadness is her own
Give herself a bath of tears
And go home, and go home
