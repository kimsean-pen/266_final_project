My peace of mind depends on you
My space in time is here with you too
Drop all your dreams in the palm of my hand
Step in the blue light, fulfill my plans
Come with me now the midnight calls
All are asleep as the kingdom falls
Seeking our goals as a life had planned
Walk in the blue light you'll understand
Your sweet caress in the morning sun
Gives me the strength for what needs to be done
Soon we will hear the shades of the night
Walk in the blue light all will be right
Now you're confused so I'll set you straight
Many men died 'cause they left it too late
If you don't know what I talk about
Walk in the blue light you can find out
You'll find out
