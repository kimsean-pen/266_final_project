It's a hybrid of me -- I'm a hybrid of he
You're a misfit of me -- I'm a misfit of you... in limbo
Carbon copies run blue -- a reminder for you
But they're only skin deep crumpled shells in a heap

Marked cheap
Surrogate heads of a no-no domain
Shoulders form rows to make waves again
Catch the next plane

When you walked through the door marked "enter if you dare"
Reasoned with a friend marked "do not bend"
Bit on that finger marked "handle with care"
A tear soiled your cheek -- a broken finger on the floor

A mess in sawdust -- a shop window burst... no repairs
It's a hybrid of me -- I'm a hybrid of he
You're a misfit for me -- I'm a misfit for you
In limbo... do you speak the lingo
