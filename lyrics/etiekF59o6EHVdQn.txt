I want to hear about the savannah
The riverbeds and all of the legends
I want to feel the wind at my shoulders
Want to touch the face of a five foot boulder
I want to feel the warmth of the summer
I want to know just why I love her
I can just erase a whole number
Lay your head to sleep, breathe deeper while I

Burn it out, burn it out faster
Take your time, make it up after
Burn it out, burn it out faster
Burn it out, cause I'm not giving up

One rotation leads to another
Three trips round now, all for your mother
Make a five year window seem a little closer
Bring it on down, fly a little lower
Going six times now, and seven is getting closer
Ate my meals alone, I'm not over her
Nine comes round, and so does ten
You're my piece of heaven

Let's reacquaint and show
That something's gotta give now
I don't know how long I've been alone
Let's reacquaint and show
That something's gotta give now

Take it slow, head to a place I know

I don't know how long I've been alone
Let's reacquaint and show
That something's gotta give now

After all the time I've shed
You appear
So much wiser than before
I see it in a strand of hair
