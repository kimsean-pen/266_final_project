Well This heart of mine
Has been hardened like a stone
It might take some time
To get back what is gone

But I'm movin' on
And you don't hold my dreams
Like you did before
Oh, and I will curse your name, hey!

...
Well, I heard the news
That you were back in town
And just passin' through

To claim your lost and found
But I'm over you
And there ain't nothin' there
That you could say or do

To take what you did back
You've got nerve to waltz right in

And think what's mine is yours again
'Cause I been doin' fine without you
Forgettin' all the love we once knew

And girl, I ain't the one that slammed that door
And now you say you've changed your thinkin'
But I ain't got a heart for breakin'
So go and pick your bags up off my floor

Oh, 'cause love don't live here anymore, oh no
Well baby, you can try
To tell me how it is
And try to justify

Everything you did
But honey, I'm no fool
Oh, and I been down this road
Too many times with you

And I think it's best you go
Well, I got one thing left to say

That you can lay in the bed you made
'Cause I been doin' fine without you
Forgettin' all the love we once knew

And girl, I ain't the one that slammed that door
Oh, should've known
That now you'll say you changed your thinkin'
But I ain't got a heart for breakin'
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
Oh, 'cause love don't live here anymore, oh no
That love don't live here anymore
Oh, no, no! Should've known, no
You don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
And since you walked out of my door
Love don't live here, love don't live here, girl
Oh, love don't live here anymore!
