misery loves company
but she dont feel no better
used to be pretty as a picture
now shes ripped right through the center
her comments are misleading
and her love is unforgiving
those eyes that used to feed you
say they no longer need you
i just wanted to know, if i stay will you go

when you saw fit
when things weren't fine
youd leave it for another time
but you never told me
you never told me
i couldnt leave my head
i didnt leave my bed

i just wanted to know
if i stay will you go
