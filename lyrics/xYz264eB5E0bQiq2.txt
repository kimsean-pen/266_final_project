Real love is all around
It won't let you down
You are royalty waiting to be crowned
If that love is the truth,
It will come right back to you
It's beautiful inside of you,
It's all there for you, it's true

Don't you worry 'bout a thing my brother
I'll live as long as only takes!
Don't you worry 'bout a thing my sister
We're all waiting for a change

We're all waiting for a change, change!
We are, we are
We are waiting for a change, change!
We are, we are!

We try hard to get back
Try to keep our dreams alive
By any means, no hesitation!
When you can't see the light,
Even in your darkest night
I know, I know a change will come
It's all there for you, it's true

Don't you worry 'bout a thing my brother
I'll live as long as only takes!
Don't you worry 'bout a thing my sister
We're all waiting for a change!

We are waiting for a change, change!
We are, we are
We are waiting for a change, change!
We are, we are!
We are waiting for a change, change!
We are, we are!
We are waiting for a change, change!
We are, we are!

What if this is our last day,
So give me one more chance,
Give me one more chance!
No, you won't have the last line
So give me one more slide
One more slide of light

In control, you got so much of,
You got so much of
You got so much of
Yeah, in control, you got so much of,
You got so much of
You got so much of

Don't you worry 'bout a thing my brother
I'll live as long as only takes!
Don't you worry 'bout a thing my sister
We're all waiting for a change!

We are waiting for a change, change!
We are, we are
We are waiting for a change, change!
We are, we are!
We are waiting for a change, change!
We are, we are!
We are waiting for a change, change!
We are, we are!

Yeah, in control, you got so much of,
You got so much of
You you you got so much of
Yeah, in control, you got so much of,
You got so much of
You you you got so much of
