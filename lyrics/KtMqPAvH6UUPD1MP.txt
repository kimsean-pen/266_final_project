I know all I want to be
But slowly I get afraid of it

Please don't read this
This is a piece of shit
Please don't listen
It's not worth it

You say I could
But I know there's nothing but dead space insinde of me

You say I could
But did you take a walk with me
To the ... fields of my personality

Don't you know what it feels like
Seeing the top of the rope but never reaching it

Please don't read this
This is a piece of shit
Please don't listen
It's not worth it

You say I could
But I know there's nothing but dead space insinde of me

You say I could
But did you take a walk with me
To the crippled fields of my personality, oh

But I know
Whoa, I know
Whoa, I know
Oh, But I know, oh I know

You say I could
But I know, I know
There's nothing but dead space insinde of me, oh me
