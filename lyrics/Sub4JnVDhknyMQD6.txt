Enemies with love and without fortune
Render me while we're still immune to them
When those months have gone by shortly friend
I know, I know in war that you'll report me then

Your dismay can't be cured and at this stage
If I could, then I would, I'd help you
Rage disguises pain in the maze of blood and veins
And this gaze that kills you, gaze that kills you

Shakespeare clich√© a reality
Literally our stories from those pages
Ooh, dialect is clouding understanding
When they come a-asking
I know that you'll report me then

Your dismay can't be cured and at this stage
If I could, then I would, I'd help you
Rage disguises pain in the maze of blood and veins
And this gaze that kills you, gaze that kills you

You wanna try me on what you think you know
You never saw me, saw me ever
You wanna try me on what you think you know
You never saw me, saw me ever
You wanna try me for my crimes alone
I'll last forever, last forever

Your dismay can't be cured and at this stage
If I could then I would, I'd help you
Rage disguises pain in this age we shouldn't face
A love that kills you
