I wanna change your mind
Said, "I wanna set it right this time"
I'm looking through you
You know who you are

And planning for the apocalypse
Is not considered, considered cool
I don't suggest it myself
But no I won't sweat

I wanna change your ways
I said, "I'm gonna get it right one of these days"
And I'm looking through you
Riding the brakes

Bringing about the apocalypse
Is not considered, considered cool
And you go setting it up
But never give it a thought
Just go setting it up

My mathematical mind can see the breaks
So I'm gonna stop riding the brakes
No, no, no, no more ride the brakes
And no more ride, ride the brakes
Instead I'm gonna see your stakes
Yeah I'm gonna see the stakes

Yeah I'm gonna ride
Yeah I'm gonna ride
I'm gonna see
Yes I'm gonna see
I'm gonna see your stakes
I'm gonna see the stakes
