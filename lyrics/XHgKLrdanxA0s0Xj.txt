I'll hide my life savings in my jacket pocket
A simple sighting will do
I've been playing the same old chords
Until they start to sound out of tune

This city is insidious
I'm sitting here delirious
I'm not scared of anything
The city is insidious
I'm sitting here delirious
I'm not scared, no I'm not

I think with my heart and love with my head
Do you see the problem here?
You rip me to shreds,
I think with my heart, you fuck with my head
Do you see the problem here?
You rip me to shreds, so tear into me

Kiss me like nobody would, when I was 15
I've spent some years rewinding
But I'm still just me
Kiss me like nobody would, when I was 15
I don't invite the head rush, but it follows me

I'll hide the things that pain me
In my jacket pocket and bid the quiet adieu
I've been waiting around for nothing
Killing off the 'something to do's

This city is insidious
I'm sitting here delirious
I'm not scared of anything
The city is insidious
I'm sitting here delirious
Have you found someone new?

I think with my heart and love with my head
Do you see the problem here?
You rip me to shreds,
I think with my heart, you fuck with my head
Do you see the problem here?
You rip me to shreds, so tear

I think with my heart and love with my head
Do you see the problem here?
You rip me to shreds,
I think with my heart, you fuck with my head
Do you see the problem here?
You rip me to shreds, so tear into me

Kiss me like nobody would, when I was 15
I've spent some years rewinding, but I'm still just me
Kiss me like nobody would, when I was 15
I don't invite the head rush, but it follows me

Kiss me like nobody would, when I was 15
I'm tired of the waiting and the wondering
If I could find my something to burn out these feelings
I'd cut them out completely and I'd stop this reeling

I think with my heart and love with my head
Do you see the problem here?
You rip me to shreds
I think with my heart, you fuck with my head
Do you see the problem here?
You rip me to shreds

So tear into my heart and love with my head
Do you see the problem here?
You rip me to shreds
I've fallen apart, I'm missing your breath
Can we stand to break the fingers pointing the blame
Or will they always follow me?
