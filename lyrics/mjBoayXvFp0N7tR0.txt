Loving, lying enemy
I have seen your face before
Never thought again I'd see
Didn't want to anymore

I remember your loving eyes
And the moonlit kiss
The evening lullabies
I would truly miss

Through the years we'd had it all
The midnight whispers, the midday calls
This house of cards it had to fall

And you ask for forgiveness
You're asking too much
I have sheltered my heart
In a place you can't touch

I don't believe when you tell me
Your love is real
'Cause you don't know much about heaven, boy
If you have to hurt to feel

Every time I see you
I can't help but look away
All along I had believed
Everything you'd say

When I look now I know
I've seen your face before
I don't want your deceiving smile
Standing at my door

And I don't care what people say
I'm ready now to face this day
'Cause I have lost you along the way

And you ask for forgiveness
You're asking too much
I have sheltered my heart in a place
You can't touch

I don't believe when you tell me
Your love is real
'Cause you don't know much about heaven, boy
If you have to hurt to feel
'Cause you don't know much about heaven, boy
If you have to hurt

To ask for forgiveness
You're asking too much
I have sheltered my heart in a place
You can't touch

I don't believe when you tell me
Your love it real
'Cause you don't know much about heaven, boy
If you have to hurt to feel
