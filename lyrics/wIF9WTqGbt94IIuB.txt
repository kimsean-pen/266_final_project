Back to the nightmare!

You can smell the danger, watch your step
See the friendly stranger, stretch your neck
Keep them in the dark, now, it's alright
You know they only come out at night

Your shadow's alive
It breathes at your side
Got no place to hide
Be with you 'til the day you die

You can hear the whispers, shut your mouth
Deal with the misfits, wipe 'em out
Search in all the bedrooms, use your head
Listen to your conscience, wake the dead

Your shadow's alive
It breathes at your side
Got no place to hide
Be with you 'til the day you die
The day you die

Mother kissed the vampire, shut the door
Rats in all the rooms, babe, hit the floor
I say it's a gamble, but what's your sign?
Up way at the downside, stay in line

Your shadow's alive
It breathes at your side
There's no place to hide
Be with you 'til the day you die

Die! Die! Die you bastard!
