Standing there alone, the ship is waiting
All systems are go
are you sure?

Control is not convinced
But the computer has the evidence
No need to abort
the countdown starts
watching in a trance
the crew is certain

Nothing left to chance, all is working
Trying to relax, up in the capsule
"Send me up a drink", jokes Major Tom

The count goes on

Earth below us, drifting falling
Floating weightless, calling calling home

(...)
Second stage is cut, we're now in orbit
stabilizers up, running perfect
starting to collect, requested data
what will it effect, when all is done

Thinks Major Tom
Back at ground control, there is a problem
Go to rockets full, not responding
Hello Major Tom, are you receiving

turn the thrusters on, we're standing by

There's no reply
Earth below us, drifting, falling

Floating, weightless, calling, calling, home
(...)
Across the stratosphere

A final message, "Give my wife my love"
Then nothing more
Far beneath the ship, the world is mourning
They don't realize, he's alive

No one understands but Major Tom sees

Now the life commands, this is my home
I'm coming home

Earth below us, drifting, falling
Floating, weightless, coming home
Earth below us, drifting, falling
Floating, weightless, coming home
Earth below us, drifting, falling
Floating, weightless, coming, coming home
