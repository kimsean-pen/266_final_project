Maybe this, made for two, maybe you
But I can't put a Fy's apple pie in my mind
With distractions that happen
Refraction that matters is clear
Disappear in an empty room

Oh, I wanted to be next to you
When it all falls through
When your world implodes
When your memory goes
When it all takes its toll
I'll put my heart into your hands

I wouldn't stop the red lights
I wouldn't come up for air
I wouldn't stop the red lights
I wouldn't even have to think twice

I wouldn't stop the red lights
I wouldn't come up for air
I wouldn't stop the red lights
Red light, red light, red light
Red light, [unverified] red lights

You can try if you like
Terrorizing my mind
What you see you at night
While I can't leave behind
With a futile gesture

A loaded question
I know must be hope
A romantic notion
A self not enough

Circumstances dictate as a whim [unverified]
As a fire that still burns inside
If you were to call
I'd risk a second broken heart for you

I wouldn't stop the red lights
I wouldn't come up for air
I wouldn't stop the red lights
I wouldn't even have to think twice

I wouldn't stop the red lights
I wouldn't come up for air
I wouldn't stop the red lights
Red light, red light, red light
Red light [unverified] red lights

I wouldn't stop the red lights
I wouldn't come up for air
I wouldn't stop the red lights
I wouldn't stop the red lights

I wouldn't stop the red lights
I wouldn't stop the red lights
I wouldn't stop the red lights
