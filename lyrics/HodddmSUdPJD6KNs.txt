Okey,
You and me
I am not ... memories
They were never seem to fade away
I've been gone such a long time
What I've played you if you left

After all
Sweld then smoke
But still give my love
Don't you cry
Wonder why
Giving you my trust
I've been gone such a long time
What I've played you if you left me

I've been gone such a long time
What I've played you if you left

After all

Circulate me of the love

I've been gone such a long time
What I've played you if you left
