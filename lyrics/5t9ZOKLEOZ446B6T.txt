Window paine
Around my heart
Shadows streak
Around my heart

Do what you got to do
And say what you got to say
Do what you got to do
Yes, start today
Start today

Wind blow shame
Around my heart
Shadows scream
Around my heart

What are you coming to
Stripped down to the bone?
Laughing, living on your own
All alone

Do what you got to do
And say what you got to say
Do what you got to do
Yes, start today
Start today
