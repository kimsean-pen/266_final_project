I wanna go good god, go through me
I wanna say that I won't try
I wanna fuck with the fuckers that don't fuck much
I wanna fuck with the roots inside
I wanna seem like an angel that don't get no love
I'll plant a seed and we can watch it as it dies
I'll watch the city as it burns
I watch your feet hang from the rafters
I watch your family as they cry
I watch your mom say "Nothing is below me"
I watch your dad say "I didn't try"
This is my fault now, don't forget it
This is my fault now, don't you forget it
This is my fault now, don't forget it
This is my fault now, don't you forget it
This is my fault now, don't forget it
This is my fault now, don't you forget it
This is my fault now, don't forget it
This is my fault now, don't you forget it

The shapes follow me
The shapes follow align
The lights follow me up into the city sky
With your lipstick and your red dress
And your kind heart balanced with my drug sick friends
That call when they shouldn't
When you fall, when you couldn't
Save them all from their mistakes
Ones you called ones you prayed for
Please just crawl underneath my skin
It's all yours for the raising
Please just crawl underneath my skin
It's all yours for the taking
Please just crawl underneath my skin
It's all yours for the raising
Please just crawl underneath my skin
It's all yours for the taking

Hold on
Wake up
Get drunk
Get fucked up
And pass without me
You're so lovely

I am afraid of losing all my love
I am afraid of ending up alone
I am afraid of being on the road
I am afraid of losing all control
I am afraid of losing all my love
I am afraid of ending up alone
I am afraid of being on the road
I am afraid of, I am afraid of

Cut out the pieces, cut out the pieces
Cut out the pieces

And it was apples to apples, but you are lemons to apples
I am the ghost in your closet
I think your body don't want it
I am the past and the present
I saw the good and the evil
I am an angel and devil
The friend that still needs you
I am the boyfriend that cheated
You are the girlfriend that left you
I am the friend that you hated
I think your brother still loves you
And I was apples to apples, but you are lemons to apples.
I am the ghost in your closet
Think your body don't want it
I am the past and the present
Saw the good and the evil
I am an angel and devil
The friend that still needs you
I am the boyfriend that cheated.
