And the rain was there...
There were many nights...

And a few of them, were all that you have dreamed of
Love was the thing...
And you feel as if someone was following you
But you know you are wrong...
It's just the ghost of what you want to be
And the ghost of the past that you live in

It's just the ghost of what you really want
And it's the ghost of the past that you live in
And it's the ghost of the future you are frightened of
So you look to you guardian angel

So long ago I was an innocent...
It had nothing to do with age
One day they were lovers... one day they were friends
There was nothing else to say

Well just the ghost of what you want to be
And the ghost of the past that you live in
It's just the ghost of the future that you're so frightened of
So you turn to your guardian angel

And a few of them were all that you really dreamed of
Love was the thing...
So the silver haired girl looks for escapism

To feel the empty spaces she's feeling
She depends on her music like a husband
And she knows it's no good to fall in love again...
One day they were lovers... one day they were friends
There was nothing else to say

It's just the ghost of the past of what you want to be
And the ghost of the past that you live in
Ghost of the future that you're so frightened of
So you look to your guardian

So you look... to your guardian angel
Some of them are here on earth
Well some of them are way up there in heaven...

So you look... to your guardian
Some of them are here on earth...
Some of them are... way up there in heaven... heaven...
