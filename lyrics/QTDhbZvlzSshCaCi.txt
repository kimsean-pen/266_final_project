Dearest, I'm broken
My body is unspoken
How could I be loved?

Wake up in the morning
Feeling uncertain
Like a burning old scar

For I remember
The courage I had as a child
Various colors I'm hiding inside

She's a rainbow
Ah...
She's a rainbow
Ah...
And I am
A difficult man
And I am
A difficult man

Baby I'm choking
My rhythm is smoking
I'm floating around

Shaking and frozen
Earth that I've choosen
Surfing the clouds

For I remember
The joy I have had as child
Various colors I'm hiding inside

She's a rainbow
Ah...
She's a rainbow
Ah...
And I am
A difficult man
And I am
A difficult man
And I am
A difficult man

She's a rainbow
Ah...
She's a rainbow
Ah...
