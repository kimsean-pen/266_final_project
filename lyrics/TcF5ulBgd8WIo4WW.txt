I'm begging you, begging you
I'm begging you
I'm begging you, begging you

The fly on the coach wheel told me that he got it
And he knew what to do with it
Everybody saw it, saw the dust that he made

King bee in a frenzy, ready to blow
Got the horn good to go wait
Oh, his stings all gone
Now he's begging you, begging you

Here is a warning, the sky will divide
Since I took off the lid, there's nowhere to hide
Now I'm begging you, begging you

This is a mystery not to be solved
But be minded, like minded
I'm gone still I'm with you
I'm begging you, begging you

Give it over, give it over
Give it over, give it over
Give it over, give it over
Give it over, give it over
Yeah I'm begging you, I'm begging you
Give it over, give it over
Give it over
Yeah I'm begging you, I'm begging you

Weigh it and say it, is it all in a name
Does it call you or maul you and drive you insane
Can it make you remember, time is in place
Now I'm begging you, I'm begging you

The fly on the coach wheel told me that he got it
And he knew what to do with it
Everybody saw it, saw the dust that he made

Make all the dust that you can
Make all the dust that you can
King bee in a frenzy ready to blow
