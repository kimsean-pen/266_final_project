She was swinging by the Bangles in a main street store
A while before we met
The most dangerous angles that you ever saw
She spied her amulet
And she took a loop of leather from around her neck
And that was then the start
The most dangerous lady on her quarter deck
She found her golden heart
You found your golden heart

Then we swirled around each other and the thread was spun
To some Arcadian band
I would stop it from swinging like a pendulum
Just to hold time in my hand
And you shot me with a cannonball of history
And long forgotten art
I'd be turning it over as our words ran free
I'd hold your golden heart
I'd hold your golden heart

Nothing in the world prepared me for your heart, your heart
Nothing in the world that I love more, your heart, your heart
Your golden heart

Your golden heart
Your golden heart
Your golden heart
Your golden heart, golden heart

And every time I'm thinking of you from a distant shore
And all the time I sleep
I will have a reminder that my baby wore
A part of you to keep
And I'll send you all my promises across the sea
And while we are apart
I will carry the wonder that you gave to me
I'll wear your golden heart
I'll wear your golden heart

Nothing in the world prepared me for your heart, your heart
Nothing in the world that I love more, your heart, your heart
Your golden heart

Your golden heart
Your golden heart
Your golden heart
Your golden heart, golden heart

Golden heart
Your golden heart
Your golden heart
