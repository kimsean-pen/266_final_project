In the time before the twilight settles on the world
Woah, you can feel the magic
Dreaming of someone to hold tight
One more lonely girl
Woah, dances in her attic

Everywhere across the land
In front of their mirrors with combs in their hands
They prepare to make a stand
Lover to lover, woman to man
(living for the...)

Small town hot summer nights
Radio 'bout to blow
Top down under the lights
Feel the heat, wild and sweet
Hot Summer Nights

Riding solo in his front seat
Bursting at the seams
Woah, driving by desire
Home town hero haunts the main street
Dreaming desperate dreams
Woah, where theres smoke theres fire

And some believes that love is won
And some of them go like they're under the gun
In between whats already done
And the promise they feel in the evening to come
(Out for the...)

Oh' oh hot summer nights
Oh' oh hot summer nights

In the end two hearts will meet
And maybe they'll find whatever they seek
If they can, they'll learn how to keep
The faith that they found in the sound of the beat
(Out for those...)
