please
don't let it get to you
even if you don't realize it
it's still all up to you
even if you don't, even if you don't realize it
it's still all up to you

i want to
even when it don't make sense, even when it don't make sense
actually i want to more when you don't make sense
so please
don't let it get to you
i know that you won't realize it, but it's still all up to you

i know that you won't, i know that you won't realize it
but it's still all up to you

you're not gonna get it exactly how you want it
but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try
it's not gonna feel the way that you expected
and it's going to hurt to figure it out

but if you're patient
and you're kind
i don't know why

it's no fun
and how come
i still think of ya now

please
don't let it get to you
even if you don't realize it
it's still all up to you
even if you don't, even if you don't realize it
it's still all up to you
