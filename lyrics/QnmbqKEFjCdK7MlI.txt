Covered in blood
He was there for the taking

YEH YEH YEH YEH

Dancing on the city walls we were breaking

YEH YEH YEH YEH

Indigenous children
Littered the streets

YEH YEH YEH YEH

Contorted and wasted
While we eat for free

YEH YEH YEH YEH

Parading around
Some Buddhist temple

YEH YEH YEH YEH

I saw a man
Sat doused in petrol

YEH YEH YEH YEH

Caked in vigour
And colours of pride

YEH YEH YEH YEH

The smell of victory
Blows my mind

Queens
Stop taking photos of yourself

I dream about
Burying you in a forest

YEH YEH YEH YEH

If I were you
I wouldn't wait for the chorus

YEH YEH YEH YEH

I've seen your face
A thousand times

YEH YEH YEH YEH

Ignorant smiles
A mile wide

YEH YEH YEH YEH

No one loves you
I can tell

YEH YEH YEH YEH

As you spill your guts
In personal hell

Queens
Stop taking photos of yourself
Stop taking photos of yourself

Well heaven knows
You are happy now
So take some photos

Well heaven knows
You are happy now
So take some photos
