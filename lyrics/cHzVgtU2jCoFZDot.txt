I stand surrounded by the walls that once confined me
Knowing I'll be underneath them when they crumble, when they fall
With clarity my scars remind me
Ash still simmers just under my skin
Indifference smiles again
So much I hide
How is stepping back a move forward?

Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth?
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you

Tell me which is you

Eerilly time made no change
Pointing fingers, laying blame
Lying over and over and over and over
Decieving your mind
Dug my grave, trashed my name
Yet here I stand, so you won't fade away
Indifference smiles again

So much I hide
How is stepping back a move forward?

Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth?

You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Tell me which is you

I bleed inside
(I bleed)
Just let it out
(You got to let it out)

Just let it out
(You got to let it out, that bullshit)
I bleed inside
(Inside)
Just let it out
(You got to let it out)
Just let it out
(Just let it out)
Let it die!
Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you tell the truth?
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me which is you
Tell me which is you
