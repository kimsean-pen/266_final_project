Being alone is comforting, oh
My secrets stay with me, yeah, ooh

I don't tell nobody, no, no, no, no
I don't tell nobody
Most run away from me
But you found a way in me
Might have to wait for me
'Cause I don't believe in love
Can you show me?
Oh baby, you show me

I don't know how to love nobody
I don't know how to trust nobody
I need you to teach me, please teach me
I don't know how to love nobody
I don't know how to trust nobody
I need you to teach me, please teach me

I get in the way constantly
It's like I keep a tint on my window
'Fraid what you'll see if you ever look inside

I don't tell nobody, no, no, no, no
I won't tell nobody
I run away from you
But you find a way to me
Would you still wait for me?
'Cause I don't believe in love
Will you show me?
Oh baby, can you show me?

I don't know how to love nobody
I don't know how to trust nobody
I need you to teach me, please teach me
I don't know how to love nobody
I don't know how to trust nobody
I need you to teach me, please teach me

Oh, well, you're still runnin'
You're pushin' away
You still be runnin'
Yeah, you know they pushin' away
