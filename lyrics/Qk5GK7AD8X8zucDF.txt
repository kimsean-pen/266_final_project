We can move around now
You know it's so good
But I know you wouldn't come clean now, baby, even if you could

White line fever
I'm the one deceiver
White line fever, yeah
Take me away from you

Just come to me babe
We can stay right here
But you don't remember all the lines of blow you've done this year

White line fever
We're gonna make you a dreamer
White line fever, yeah
It's a slow death

Hey!

Bye, bye, bye, baby
'Cause here I come
Won't get to sleep tonight because the white lines turn me on

White line fever
Made me a believer
White line fever, yeah
It hasn't killed my yet

Oh!
