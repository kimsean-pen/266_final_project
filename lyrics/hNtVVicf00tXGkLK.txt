"Barely ever fight, she knows that I love her.
At first we made it every night, but I don't wanna bug her about it.
She just has a funny way of loving me.

Pair of ticket stubs in her desk. A movie I'd never seen.
I probably shouldn't ask, it sounds so accusing.
She must have forgot to mention girls night out.

The breakfast cereal talked more than we did all day long.
I asked her for a walk, but she had to be on her way.
So I told her that I knew she'd been steppin' out.

She swore that she could explain.
She swore that it would not happen again.
She swore that she could explain.
We both knew her words were in vain."
