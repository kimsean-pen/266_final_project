Well, she followed him from Phoenix out to Califor
And then she passed out on the bed
And all the little things he never even asked her for
She simply smiled and sher head

Why can't we smile just like we used to?
Why don't you figure anymore?
Why has my sympathy now turned to malice?
It doesn't matter anymore

And now I realize I'm livin' like a trucker does
Although I haven't got the belly
And though she followed me to California all the way
I only wanna watch the telly

Why can't we smile just like we used to?
Why don't you figure anymore?
Why has my sympathy now turned to malice?
It doesn't matter anymore

He asked her please stop quotin' Rod McKuen in your postcards, can't understand it anymore
And if your gonna read your poetry aloud to me
I'll have to show you to the door

Why can't we smile just like we used to?
Why don't you figure anymore?
Why has my sympathy now turned to malice?
It doesn't matter anymore
