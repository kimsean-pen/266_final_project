What's to say
When we break
In our skin
Hours spending
Hoots away

What's to see
Underneath where there lie
Lights rejected cannot be seen

Scare the storm
Across the pond past the swaying wreath and dragonflies
And garden fish will try to sigh
Let it sink it always does
It goes further down
And further down
To murky depths where light is found

Who's to say
How one's sad from the things
Left unspoken
That are longing

What's a world
Can love die or does it come
Back and find us
Everytime
Everytime

Scare the storm
Across the pond past the swaying wreath and dragonflies
And garden fish will try to sigh
Let it sink it always does
It goes further down
And further down
To murky depths where light is found

Scare the storm
Across the pond past the swaying wreath and dragonflies
And garden fish will try to sigh
Let it sink it always does
It goes further down
And further down
To murky depths where light is found
