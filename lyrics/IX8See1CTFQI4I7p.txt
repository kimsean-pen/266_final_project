Complication's my claim to fame
And I can't believe there's another
Constantly just another
I can't avoid what I can't control
And I'm losing ground
Still I can't stand down
And I know, yeah I know, yeah

I know you stay true when my world is false
And everything around is making time a chaos
I always seek you when my sight is lost
And everything around is making time a chaos

I know you stay true when my world is false
And everything around is making time a chaos
I always seek you when my sight is lost
And everything around is making time a chaos

It's hard to trust anyone again
After all the letdowns I've been through
Haunted by what I've been through
Best to try while I still can breathe
And I'm screaming out
Give me hope somehow
And I know, yeah I know, yeah

I know you stay true when my world is false
And everything around is making time a chaos
I always seek you when my sight is lost
And everything around is making time a chaos

I know you stay true when my world is false
And everything around is making time a chaos
I always seek you when my sight is lost
And everything around is making time

Chaos, chaos
I know you stay true, yeah
I know you stay, yeah, yeah, yeah

I know you stay true, everything around's making time
I know you stay true, everything around's making time

I know you stay true when my world is false
And everything around is making time a chaos
I always seek you when my sight is lost
And everything around is making time a chaos

I know you stay true when my world is false
And everything around is making time a chaos
I always seek you when my sight is lost
And everything around is making time a chaos
