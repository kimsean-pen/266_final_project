I know you
So good to me - so good to me now

And I want to
Just touch and move closer
To reach out and hold you
And dance in slow motion
With you

Ooh, with you
Ooh, with you

I love it when you say

"Cara Mia
There ain't no other, like you, you-hoo
Cara Mia
There ain't no others, there ain't no lovers, like you"

Oh you leave me breathless
Lonely and I'm restless
Dont you get the message?
Come and dance with me

"Cara Mia
There ain't no others, there ain't no lovers, like you"

"Ooh cara mia"
I love it when you say
"Ooh cara mia"

I know you
So good to me - so good to me now
And I know you
Yeah you
You're good to me
Oh you said to me

"Cara mia know you're number one
Will we have our day in the sun?"
I ring your telephone, 'hey hello'
Say there won't be summer alone"
