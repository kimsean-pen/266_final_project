English:

A hope in mind
is secret, and
a worn out smile reflects
in a mirror.
Bad dreams
go right away and
the world was destroyed
when I woke up.
We eat the fruit.
Make up meanings.
Seduce the reasons.
Maintain the intellect.
Want madly,
embrace the solitude tightly
and the memories I never forget.
A profile I never forget.

Write the facing time
with the fragments.
Save them and pile up
their first cries of births.
Devote myself solely
to writing to figure out
the changing prediction.
Ones who changed by it.
False name and a careless face
echoes right before my eyes.
Words of disqualification.
Will they reach me?
I see the end now.
Let's go home.
