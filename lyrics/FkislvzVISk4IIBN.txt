Willing and waiting
But it's all up to you, oh

The very first time I laid my eyes on you
I knew you were the one
Nothing can compare to all the times
We both had some fun

Sometimes I wanna cry 'cause boy I realize
I need you in my life
Don't think he understands I want him for my man
Waiting for you

I'm willing and waiting so in love with you
Willing and waiting boy it's on you

Willing and waiting boy I need the truth
Willing and waiting so in love with you

Every time boy I take one look at you
I see the sun just shine
When we're alone never want the night to end
'Cause you're the one I want

Sometimes I wanna cry 'cause boy I realize
I need you in my life
Don't think he understands I want him for my man
Waiting for you

Willing and waiting so in love with you
Willing and waiting boy it's on you

Willing and waiting boy I need the truth
Willing and waiting so in love with you

You better answer
You better answer

Sometimes I wanna cry 'cause boy I realize
I need you in my life
Don't think he understands I want him for my man
Waiting for you

Willing and waiting so in love with you
Willing and waiting boy it's on you
Willing and waiting boy I need the truth
Willing and waiting so in love with you

Willing and waiting so in love with you
Willing and waiting boy it's on you
Willing and waiting boy I need the truth
Willing and waiting so in love with you

Willing and waiting so in love with you
Willing and waiting boy it's on you
Willing and waiting boy I need the truth
Willing and waiting so in love with you

Willing and waiting so in love with you
Willing and waiting boy it's on you
Willing and waiting boy I need the truth
Willing and waiting so in love with you
