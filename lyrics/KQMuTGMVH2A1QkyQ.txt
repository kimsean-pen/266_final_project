It's all right with me
as long as you
are by my side

Talk or just say nothing
I don't mind your looks never lie
I was always on the run
finding out, what I was looking for
And I was always insecure
just until I found

Words often don't come easy
I never learned
to show you the inside of me
Oh no my baby

You were always patient
dragging out what I try to hide

I was always on the run
finding out what I was looking for
and I was always insecure
until I found

You, you were always on my mind
you, you're the one I've been living for
you, you're my everlasting fire
you're my always shining star

The night's always a good friend
a glass of wine, and the lights down low
you lying beside me, me full of love.
And filled with hope...

You, you were always on my mind
you, you're the one I've been living for
you, you're my everlasting fire
you, ooh
you're my always shining star
always on my mind
you, you're the one I've been living for
you, you're my everlasting fire
ooh, ooh
you're my always shining star
you're my always...
you're my always shining star
you're my always shining star
