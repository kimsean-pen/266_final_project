Oh, oh
Our love
Was running into a burning building
Oh, oh
Our love
Scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire

Rumors spread like wildfire
I held a strong ground
But I've been burning down
'Cause it's like fire is all I hear about
And we are fading out
Don't wanna turn out the light
But it's like

I'm no firefighter
I just need to breathe tonight
So sound the alarm
And there goes the night

Oh, oh
Our love
Was running into a burning building
Oh, oh
Our love
Scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire

Secrets in a small town
They always get around
But the flame has been put out
And I am hearing all this small talk
They whisper as I walk
In a house that's boarded up
So good luck

I'm no firefighter
I just need to breathe tonight
So sound the alarm
And there goes the night

Oh, oh
Our love
Was running into a burning building
Oh, oh
Our love
Scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire

Smoke and fire
Smoke and fire
Don't you know that
If there's smoke there's fire
Smoke there's fire
Smoke there's fire
No, no

Oh, oh
And now it's over
Oh, oh
I'm getting colder
Oh, oh
And it's the feeling
Of running into a burning building

Rumors spread like wildfire
I held a strong ground
But I've been burning down

Running into a burning building
Oh, oh
Our love
Scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire, no

Smoke there's fire
Smoke there's fire
Smoke there's fire
No, no
Oh, oh
And now it's over
Oh, oh
I'm getting colder
I'm so tired
Burning like smoke and fire
