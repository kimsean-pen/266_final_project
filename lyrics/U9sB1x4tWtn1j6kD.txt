I woke up this morning with a funny taste in my head
spackled some butter over my whole grain bread
something tastes different, maybe it's my tongue
something tastes different, suddenly i'm not so young

I'm just a stranger, even to myself
a re-arranger of the proverbial bookshelf
don't be a fool girl, tell him you love him
don't be a fool girl, you're not above him

I never thought i could love anyone but myself
now i know i can't love anyone but you
you make me think that maybe i won't die alone
maybe i won't die alone

Kiss the boys as they walk by, call me their baby
but little do they know, i'm just a maybe
maybe my baby will be the one to leave me sore
maybe my baby will settle the score

I never thought i could love anyone but myself
now i know i can't love anyone but you
you make me think that maybe i won't die alone
maybe i won't die alone.

What have I become
something soft and really quite dumb
because i've fallen, oh, 'cuz i've fall-fallen, oh 'cuz i've fall-fall-fallen
so far away from the place where i started from

I never thought i could love anyone
I never thought i could love anyone
I never thought i could love anyone
but you, but you, but you, but you, but you
but you make me think that maybe i won't die alone
maybe i won't die alone
