Empty eyes lost and hollow
a trail of tears and sorrow

The world is not your brother
too big you can't be bothered
our legacy to follow

But we will light a brighter day
we are your tomorrow

A million candles into space
we are your tomorrow

We'll find a better way
ignite a higher flame

Here to make this a safer place
we are

We'll find a better way
light up a brighter day

We are
your tomorrow

It's in our hearts to discover
the dreams we share with each other

'Cause we will light a brighter day
we are your tomorrow

A million candles into space
we are your tomorrow

We'll find a better way
light up a brighter day

We are
your tomorrow

We are we are tomorrow
we are your tomorrow
We are we are tomorrow
tomorrow
Yeah
Cause we will light a brighter day
we are your tomorrow
A million candles in the space
we are your tomorrow
We'll find a better way
light up a brighter day
We are
your tomorrow
We are
your tomorrow
