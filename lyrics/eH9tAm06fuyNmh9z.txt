There are three things I do when my life falls apart
Number one I cry my eyes out and I dry up my heart
Not until I do this will my new life start
So that's the first thing that I do when my life falls apart

Oh the second thing that I would do is I would close both of my eyes
And sing my thank yous to each and every moment of my life
I go where I know the love is and let it feel me up inside
Gathering new strength from sorrow
I'm glad to be alive

And things are looking up
I know above the clouds the sun is shining
(Mmmm things are looking up)
Love is still the answer I'm relying on my

Three little things
(Ohwh owhoo ohwh)
Things are looking up (Ohwh owhoo ohwh)
(Ohwh owhoo ohwh)
(Ohwh owhoo ohwh)

Yeah the third thing that I do now when my world caves in is
I pause I take a breath and bow and I let that chapter end
I design my future bright not by where my life has been
And I try, try, try, try
Try agin
Yes, I try, try, try, try
Tru again

Things are looking up
I know beyond the dark the sun is rising (Mmmm)
Things are looking up
I know above the clouds the sun is shining (Mmmm)
Things are looking up
Love is still the answer I'm relying on

Three little things
Three little things

(Ohwh owhoo ohwh)
Three little things
(Ohwh owhoo ohwh)
