Don't fall down tonight
You're alive and so am I
Hold on we might hot-wire
This old car and drive

Sticks and stones
They say but we don't have bones inside our brains
If bones are the walls between you and I then I feel pretty tempted
To beat myself with sticks and stones, anyway
I've got a ray gun in my bag, a treasure map under my hat
And I'll never miss a headshot or a dotted line
I've spent way too much time thinkin about dreamin about life
To miss the point, which is just listen
'Cause I've listened for mine
