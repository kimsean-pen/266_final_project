Everybody wonders and some people know
I guess that I'm some people 'cause baby it shows
When will you do it? And why will you go
If you've already decided then deliver the blow

The way you walk around me
The way you talk around me
You act so speechless
You've got nothing to, nothing to say
The way you walk around me
The way you're talking to me
Makes me wonder
If this was only play

And I wonder will you still love me
Do you still love me, like you did before (did you before)

Said come on baby you think I'm so blind
I see what you're doing behind my back all the time
I get suspicious when you call me someone else's name
You think I don't notice that nothing's the same' anymore
(repeat chorus)

And I wonder will you still love me
Did you ever love me, or were you playing with me before
Ohh baby you think I'm so blind
Ohh baby I'm not playing around this time
(repeat chorus)

And I wonder will you still love me
Did you ever love me, or are you showing me, showing me the door
Did you before
Ohh baby you think I'm so blind
Ohh baby I'm not playing around this time
Ohh baby you think I'm so blind
Ohh baby I'm not playing around this time
