Talking talking your way out
But he's still on the lookout
I lost my voice I think in colours
We make love a sorry hearse
I cry a thousand more mirrors
So that your eyes could get brighter
Obediently I bay a name
I share it with the wind I tamed
Can you see my heart (repeat

Narcissus is back from under water
and kisses his lips again
Narcissus is back from under water
and kisses his lips again
Narcissus is back I shouldn't bother
I break the mirrors that I meet
Narcissus is back from under water
and has his own lips to drink

Tututututu Tutututu Tutututu Tutututu

The water water is so cold
It poisons anyone who calls
A loving hand and daring kiss
Now watches everything you miss
It's getting hard to look away
It's not your office anyway
Its much too easy to disperse
Et moi je prie pour une avers
Can you see my heart
Can you see my heart
Can you see my heart
Can you see my heart
Can you see my heart
Can you see my heart
Can you see my heart
Can you see my heart

Narcissus is back

Narcissus is back

Narcissus is back

Narcissus is back

Narcissus is back

Narcissus is back

Narcissus is back from under water
and kisses his lips again
Narcissus is back from under water
and kisses his lips again
Narcissus is back I shouldn't bother
I break the mirrors that I meet
Narcissus is back from under water
and has his own lips to drink
