You won't find me here.
The place that you expected me to be
In my bed on the second floor.

I'm outside your house, I'm closing in on you.
And all the times you smiled
You say hello and thought I was ok

I was planning your final struggle.
But, when you wake up, I'll be there.
When you see me, you'll be on your back again.

When you, when you, when you, when you
Know you're already dead
You'll love me, too.
Verst 2:
You will find me here.
The place you least expected me to be
Breaking through your basement window.

i'm outside your room, I can hear you breathe.
And all the times you laughed.
You smy hand and thought I was your friend

I was planning your tragic ending.
When you wake up, I'll be there.
When you see me, you'll be on your back again.
When you, when you, when you, when you

Know you're already dead
You'll love me, too.
(Guitar solo 2)

You look down on me, with eyes of endless tragedy.
Try and stop the pain, but there's never closure.

Find your solace in what you could have been.
When they look for me, the evidence is buried deep.
Try to guide the way into the darkness.
When you wake up, I'll be there.
When you see me, you'll be on your back again.
When you, when you, when you, when you
Know you're already dead
You'll love me, too.
