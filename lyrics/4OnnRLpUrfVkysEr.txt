My girl money like payday
I could sit and watch her all day
P-town sippin' lattes
We were North just before Kanye
You're my queen like Yoncé
She gonna say what she wanna say
Paris all the way to Paraguay
Come with me Hail Mary like Elway

'Cause I miss her in the mornin' when I'm gone
And I call from a different timezone
Birthdays, to champagne, to chill days
Doesn't matter I'm sold

My girl is money, money
Dollar, dollar bill
My girl is money, money
Dollar, dollar bill
Ain't nothin' like a nahnah nah
Can't live without a nah nah nah
My girl is money, money
Dollar, dollar bill
Dollar, dollar bill ya'll

Gonna take her on a vacay
Eatin' poke and ándale
Strummin' ukelele, she say
You sound a little like Coldplay
She take me high like jet plane
First class like cabernet
No she ain't no one way
Round trip curves oughta have their own runway
Yeah

'Cause I miss her in the morning when I'm gone
And I call from a different timezone
Birthday's to champagne to chill days doesn't matter I'm sold

My girl is money, money
Dollar, dollar bill
My girl is money, money
Dollar, dollar bill
Ain't nothin' like a nah nah nah
Can't live without a nah nah nah
My girl is money, money
Dollar, dollar bill
Dollar, dollar bill ya'll

Oh I'm a rich man, rich man
Oh with you in my hands

My girl is money, money
Dollar, dollar bill
My girl is money, money
Dollar, dollar bill
Ain't nothin' like a nah nah nah
Can't live without a nah nah nah
My girl is money, money
Dollar, dollar bill
Dollar, dollar bill ya'll

My girl is money, money
Dollar, dollar bill
Dollar, dollar bill ya'll
