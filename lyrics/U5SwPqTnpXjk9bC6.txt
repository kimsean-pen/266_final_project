I wanna see through the darkness
Don't wanna live with this fear
That I will come to the day
When my heart stops to beat
And cope with the fact that I'll leave you to be
Alone without guidance
Inherit the throne
I am a man that was blind
But you made me believe
No road is to long you have given me peace

Have a look in the mirror
A fallen hero, you came into my life
When it was down on zero

I will never surrender this fight
I will stay till the end of the line

Every little piece of my heart belongs
To you I'll carry on
For you I'll sacrifice myself
Destiny was there to abandon me
You're my eternity
The reason I fight
Instead of just break down and cry

There is this force of your presence
My fuel to be free
As I step into a void no predictions in sight
I never be lonely with you by my side
Indescribable motion
A conjuction with fate
I wanna give you the stars like you show me the world
The meaning of life is your love in return

Like I am back from the dead you came close to my heart
Made a bond that will never be torn apart
I will never surrender this fight
I will stay till the end of the line

Every little piece of my heart belongs
To you I'll carry on
For you I'll sacrifice myself
Destiny was there to abandon me
You're my eternity
The reason I fight
Instead of just break down and cry

Every little piece of my heart belongs
To you I'll carry on
For you I'll sacrifice myself
Destiny was there to abandon me
You're my eternity
The reason I fight
Instead of just break down and cry
