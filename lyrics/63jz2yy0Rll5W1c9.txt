I wouldn't be angry if you'd just fucking cried
Your tears would arouse me, refreshing my supply
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in vain!

I wouldn't be angry if things would stay the same
You're fighting the torment that helps me feed my pain
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in...

I can't hear this
I can't fuck it
I can't take this
I hate

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in...

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in vain!
