free time, free time
I have got it gonna get me some
free time, free time
I would spend it forever captivated
free time, free time
would you tell me the secret of yr arm
free time, free time
forever fabulastic, blowup, pleasuristic
I feel combustible
that's my will say it all
mille feuille
mille feuille
mille feuille
now you better take a deep breath
the smell is just the best
i'll transform even yr breast
you are my new weekend guest
I can't believe this could happen to me
caught inside someone's knee
free time, free time
uncovered forever barest endeavor
free time, free time
if you want me splash me forever
free time, free time
let it happen the leisure, enchanting
free time, free time
yr neck is my favorite pleeze don't spare it
I feel combustible that's my will, say it all
now you better cough up the dough
if you want to join the show
exotique is not for free
spend wisely eternity
engine of desire is on the road
don't get stuck without a job
free time, free time
you have got it gonna get me some
free time, free time
wandering, fantastic, sparkling demanded
free time, free time
did I mention that you control me
free time, free time
the merest endeavor slightly forever
mille feuille
mille feuille
mille feuille
mille feuille
