Passing bells...
Call for me...
In my shroud...
I'm sentenced to death!

Passing bells...
Call for me...
In my shroud...
I wait for final dawn!

When the morning comes
I will fear the death drums
Pulse for me the last march
Pulse for me the last march!

At the deaths door
I will feel no agony
And I'll accept my destiny
I'll accept my destiny!

Passing bells...
Call for me...
In my shroud...
I'm sentenced to death!

Passing bells...
Call for me...
In my shroud...
I wait for final dawn!

For the last time
I will see the sky above
When walking towards ending
Walking towards ending!

Still for hours left
Until I breath my final breath
At last I will be free
At last I will be free!
