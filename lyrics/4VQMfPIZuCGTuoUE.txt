Eyes on eyes, I thought you taught me
Don't get caught too tied to eyes
Eyes that frequently do cross me
Wake me up, I want your type

I can't sleep I've gotta see them
I've seen all kinds of eyes
All the eyes I could've seen and
Yours came beamin' I can't look back
I'm changed in you

Eyes, eyes

I've seen eyes look like rubies
I've watched them do their crimson cryin'
I've seen eyes so soft and soothing
Take me for a pleasure ride

Why'd you have to do that to me?
Make me forget all those eyes
Eyes that saw me like a movie
You did improve me, I can't look back

Eyes that came from the good old days
They left me now as though they
Saw me like a child
They're floating now and while my days are blurry eyed

I saw your face put me into a better light
I'd seen it in your eyes I do
I'm changed in you

Eyes, eyes

Eyes I should've never seen
Rise up from your daily dine
Give me comfort, let me leave
Cause some day yours eyes might change mine

One more look, just one more peep
Do you remember that sweet time
When I saw you see me in your eyes
I saw you see me in your eyes
I saw you see me in your eyes
I saw you see me in your eyes

Eyes that came from the good old days
They left me now as though they
Saw me like a child
They're floating now and while my days are blurry eyed

I saw your face put me into a better world
I'd seen it in your eyes I do
I'm changed in you

Eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes
