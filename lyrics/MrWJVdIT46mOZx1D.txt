Am gonna do my best again
Am gonna go my way, mamma
Tomorrow am gonna catch a train
Don't try to hold me down
I wanna put my chest against the wind
From east and west once again
Mamma
Give me your blessing right now

Am gonna get ahead again
Am gonna go my way, mamma
Before you tie me to a chain
Before you close me down
So wide you should stretch your breast
And hold my life inside yourself again
Mamma
Give me your blessing right now

I wanna kiss your face again
Am gonna go my way, mamma
Don't worry, don't cry, don't complain
Don't try to hold me down
How much you want your darling, baby
Clinging to your long skirt again
Oh, mamma
Give me your blessing right now
