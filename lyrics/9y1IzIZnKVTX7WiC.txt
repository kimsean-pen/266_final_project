this feeling haunts me
behind these eyes
the shell seems so empty
does anything live inside?

i want to live
i wish i was dead

my heart aches to believe
im cheated by what i see
freedom holds a double edge for me
i look in your eyes and see

i want to live
i wish i was dead

i dont even want to think im stuck here
and i know it
i dont want to see
make me close my eyes

i want to live
i wish i was dead

i look in your eyes
and see its always this way
live the tlive and take a dive
just to make it die

ive just got to close my eyes
ive got to close my eyes
ive got to close my eyes
