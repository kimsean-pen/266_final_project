You don't believe
In new religion
You don't think that it's true
But you're convinced
Walking underneath a ladder
Bad luck will come to you

You are just a silhouette
Un, deux, trois the sun has set

Keep it cool
This love is strong
We're made to fall
Eyes wide open
Do you see the pain behind
The broken lives
Slowly drifting
Don't keep your compliments to yourself

I don't believe
In keeping secrets
I ran so far to see
What was left from my bottle
Truth slipped up in my hotel
Bad luck will come to me

Keep it cool
This love is strong
We're made to fall
Eyes wide open
Do you see the pain behind
The broken lives
Slowly drifting
Don't keep your compliments to yourself

I hope you don't feel lonely when you die
And someone will be with you when you cry
Don't keep your compliments to yourself
Don't keep them all, don't keep them all

Keep it cool
This love is strong
We're made to fall
Eyes wide open
Do you see the pain behind
The broken lives
Slowly drifting
Don't keep your compliments to yourself

Keep it cool
This love is strong
We're made to fall
Eyes wide open
Do you see the pain behind
The broken lives
Slowly drifting
Don't keep your compliments to yourself
