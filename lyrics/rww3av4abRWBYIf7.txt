Donnie, what did Roberta Sparrow say to you?
She said that every living creature on earth dies alone.
"How did that make you feel?"
"It reminded me of my dog, Callie. She died when I was eight. She crawled underneath the... the porch."
"To die?"
"To be alone."
"Do you feel alone right now?"
"I don't know. I mean I'd like to believe. I'm not, but I just... I've just never seen any proof so I... just don't debate it any more, it's I could spend my whole life debating it over and over again weighing the pros and cons, and in the end I still wouldn't have any proof. So I just, I just don't debate it any more. It's absurd."
"The seard for God is absurd?"
"It is if everyone dies alone."
"Does that scare you?"
"I don't wanna be alone."
