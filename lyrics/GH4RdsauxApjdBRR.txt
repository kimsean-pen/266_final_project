[Group:]
Would You Like That?
Do You Like That?
I Know You Like That!

[Aundrea:]
Staring At Me All Night While I'm Out On The Floor
It Was Clear What You Wanted
So You Pushed Up On It

[Aubrey:]
I Was Griding With The DJ With My Hands On The Floor
I Guess You Couldn't Take It
You Got Tired Of Waiting

[Dawn:]
So You Walked Over To Me
Breathing In My Ear Talking 'Bout What Could Be
Saying You Can Do This And That
And You Start Working Me Like A Champ
And I'm Like

[Chorus:]
Ohhh, You're Touching My Body
Ohhhh, You Just Want Me To Get Started
Boy I Can't Take It It's So Crazy
How You Making Me Feel

Ohhh, You'r Touching My Body
Ohhhh, You Just Want Me To Get Started
Boy I Can't Take It It's So Crazy
How You Making Me Feel

[Shannon:]
If I Want You More (Would You Like That?)
Keep It Nice And Warm (Do You Like That?)
Do It On The Floor (Do You Like That?)
I Wanna Give You Some More (I Know You Like That)

[D. Woods:]
Now You Got Me Sweating dancing out of my clothes
I Was Heading For The Door
But You Made It So I Had To Know
Just What You Was Working With
And I Put It Up There Told You Come Get It
Now I'm The One That Can Handle It
The Way You Working Me Right On The Floor

[Dawn:]
So You Walked Over To Me
Breathing In My Ear Talking 'Bout What Could Be
Saying You Can Do This And That
And You Start Working Me Like A Champ
And I'm Like

[Chorus:]
Ohhh, You're Touching My Body
Ohhhh, You Just Want Me To Get Started
Boy I Can't Take It It's So Crazy
How You Making Me Feel

Ohhh, You're Touching My Body
Ohhhh, You Just Want Me To Get Started
Boy I Can't Take It It's So Crazy
How You Making Me Feel

[Shannon:]

When You Touching Me Like That
Step Back And Catch My Breath This Way
