Share with me the sun
You forget sometime it's ours
Can't you see you're not the only one
You're told to lead outside
Feel it sulk into your mind
Can't you see you're not the only one

As you slipped on down the length of my tonuge
Did you taste the sun that i need home

You carried us all
Down from the stars
And up from the sea (Where everybody knew)
All you see, and all you hear
Is all you need, and all you breathe
While you create
And it's in your mind

Share with me the sun
We'll forget all that is ours
Forget me and all the things you see

The times already came in the news
It was the word that took your brain

You carried us all
Down from the stars
And up from the sea (Where everybody knew)
All you see, and all you hear
Is all you need, and all you breathe
While you create
And it's in your mind

There's nothing I can say or do
(There's nothing I can say or do)
And there's no light for me to see
(And there's no light for me to see)
So there was nothing left to do

You, You carried us all
Down from the stars
And up from the sea
You carried us all
Down from the stars
And up from the sea (where everybody knew)
All you see, and all you hear
Is all you need, and all you breathe
While you create
And it's in your mind

There's nothing I can say or do
(There's nothing I can say or do)
And there's no light for me to see
(And there's no light for me to see)
There was nothing left to do
There was nothing left to do
