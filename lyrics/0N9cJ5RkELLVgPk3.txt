It's the look in your eyes that told me
It's the way that we lie that haunts me.
I will love you forever more
I will love you forever more.
It's the fear of hight that kills me
From all that we hide, we will be.
I will love you forever more
I will love you forever more.
Whole my heart is telling me
that it's now or we'll never be.
You take away all my fears
You take away all my fears.
I won't let you ever give up
Can't you see, I want you so much.
You take away all my fears
You take away all my fears.
I will tell you for the first time
I will tell you what I've always wanted to.
I will try, so we never go back.
We've pretended for the last time
and I swear I'll be the only one for you.
I will try, so we never go back.
I will give you all that I've got
Somehow I don't think I can stop.
So take away all my fears
So take away all my fears.
Oh my heart, tell me that you feel it
I don't wanna see us ever give up
I'll love you forever, I hope that we'll never
Never give up.
I will tell you for the first time
I will tell you what I've always wanted to.
I will try, so we never go back.
We've pretended for the last time
and I swear I'll be the only one for you.
I will try, so we never go back.
I will tell you for the first time
I will tell you what I've always wanted to. I will tell you for the first time
I will tell you what I've always wanted to.
I will try, so we never go back.
We've pretended for the last time
and I swear I'll be the only one for you.
I will try, so we never go back.
