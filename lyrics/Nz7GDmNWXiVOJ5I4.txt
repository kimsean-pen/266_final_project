Closet filled to the brim with miserabilia
I often count how many steps we are apart
Flip over in bed, and smell you in my pillows
I see a bull running in the fields and i'm scared
Waking up 900 miles away from home expecting to see you floating face down in the okanogan river
I was scared my rock would sink, and it did
And you did
If you died I wouldn't be light, but i wouldn't be heavy anymore
Happy anniversary
