Well, if you ever plan to motor west
Travel my way, take the highway, that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66

Well it winds from Chicago to L. A.
More than two thousand miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66

Well it goes to St. Louis, down to Missouri
Oklahoma City looks oh, so pretty
You'll see Amarillo, Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona, don't forget Wynonna
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino

You get hip to this kind of trip
I'm gonna take that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66
