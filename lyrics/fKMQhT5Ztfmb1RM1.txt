On this day, where you're so messed it's clear
Can't explain the road you roam
Anyone, who's been

As I walk with you, it chills me so
To hear you say, it's gone the worse, so I cared
Here I dream, I always talked to you

You seem fine again, my sweet
Feels alright to me
Is it right for you?

Flippin' out I try to call to you, till you come to me
Tell me, what to do?
And I know it's not the same, there's no blame

But still I bother you
And you say it's not true, dear, it's mine to fear
Follow through
Come alive, I know you'll sing with me

I won't sing to you, it's not a thing I do
How's it been a different feel for you?

Wholesomeness was gone along
Or is it something new?
And I know it's not the same, there's no blame

But still I bother you
And you say, it's not true dear, it's mine to fear
We won't coexist
Anyway you're not the same, it's the blame

Follow through
It's a lingering that comes through me

Does it come to you?
Are we really through?
Any guy would do this thing for me
It's not much to ask
Why can't you?
I'm not gonna say, I've had my way
You should solve it out
What else can I do?
You promised so much, lied with every touch
I believed in you
Follow through
