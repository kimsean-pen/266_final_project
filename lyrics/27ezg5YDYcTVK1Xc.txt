It's a lie, it's a lie like a sweet
Eat it up, eat it up like a pig
He's in peace, he's in peace, he likes to be like a king

It's a lie, it's a lie, it's so sweet
Like a pit, like a pit he's in there
It's a grave, it's a grave, he likes to hide in a cage

Easy task – he wants to act like a god
Easy fakes – he made up sold out still
Lack of brain – he can't think like a slag
Twenty hands kill his lies shouting "Vanish!"

Easy naps – he can take like a dead
Easy words – he can speak nothing much
Lack of books – he can pick no line left
Twenty eyes kill his lies shouting "Punish!"

It's a lie, it's a lie like a sweet
He eats up, he eats up for his bugs
He's a lie, he's a lie, he eats lies to grow up

Say, I can try like a fictive play
So what? He can play in the wonder land
So what's next? Next lie to eat
So what's next key to (key to), key to press to, to shut down?

It's a lie, it's a lie like a sweet
Eat it up, eat it up like a pig
He's in peace, he's in peace, he likes to be like a king

It's a lie, it's a lie, it's so sweet
He eats up, he eats up for his bugs
He's a lie, he's a lie, he eats lies to grow up

Say, I can fake in my fictive play
So what? He can play in the wonder land
So what's next? Next lie to eat
So what's next key to (key to), key to press to delete him now?
I can make my cheap game complete
