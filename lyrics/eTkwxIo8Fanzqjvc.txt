I heard a voice speak it to me
Like a soft wind blowing' through the trees
Hold her close, hold her tight
I could fill you up with love and life

She's like the warmth of the sun
She's like the warmth of the sun

And she went blue but she kept me warm
Her love could shelter me through any storm
A pair of eyes pass me by
But she can separate the day from night

She's like the warmth of the sun
She's like the warmth of the

I heard a voice speak it to me
Like the waves that whisper to the sea
I hold her close, hold her tight
Let me fill you up with love and light

She's like the warmth of the sun
She's like the warmth of the sun
