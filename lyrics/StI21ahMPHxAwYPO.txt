It's been about a year now, ain't seen or heard from you
I been missin' you crazy, how do you, how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me, it still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep (how do you sleep)

I tried my best at movin' on, have yet to find a girl like you
See things now, I didn't before now wishin' I had more time with you
How do you stay awake knowin' all I do is think of you
All the things we thought about then never will happen again
If I could just see you

If I had my way, I'll come and getcha girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

It's been about a year now, ain't seen or heard from you
I been missin' you crazy, how do you, how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me, it still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep

It's been about a year now, ain't seen or heard from you
I been missin' you crazy, how do you, how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me, it still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep (how do you sleep)

Baby all that I hear from my friends again, again and again
(They come and ask about you, they say)
We saw your girl at the game
And damn we gotta say a big mistake by you
Not only does your body bang but I miss the conversation too
Tell me that you couldn't go to sleep, can't think, can't eat
'Til I come see you

If I had my way, I'll come and getcha girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

It's been about a year now, ain't seen or heard from you
I been missin' you crazy, how do you, how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me, it still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep (how do you sleep)
