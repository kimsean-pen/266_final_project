I made a wish and now I know where you are, boy
(Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh)
I think I found it, you're my lucky star, boy
(Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh)
It's not the kind of feeling that you fight, boy
(Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh)
Cause I can see you in the darkest night, boy
(Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh)

In your atmosphere
It's all so clear
Let's get out of here, to a private affair
It's truth or dare and I'm not scared
You're almost there, we got something to share

Turn the lights off, I feel the spark
Can you make me glow in the dark? Cause I wanna glow in the dark!
Hey-ey-ey
Turn the lights off, it's about to start
Can you make me glow in the dark? Cause I wanna glow in the dark!
Hey-ey-ey
Glow in the dark
Glow in the dark
Hey-ey-ey
Glow in the dark
Glow in the dark
Hey-ey-ey

I see your heart cause it's illuminating
(Whoa oh oh oh) Yeah (Whoa oh oh oh)
I feel your light because it's radiating
(Whoa oh oh oh) Yeah (Whoa oh oh oh)
I feel your heartbeat cause the light is streaming
(Whoa oh oh oh Yeah (Whoa oh oh oh)
Cut through the night just like a laser beaming
(Whoa oh oh oh) Yeah (Whoa oh oh oh)

Oh
In your atmosphere (Atmosphere)
It's all so clear (All so clear)
Let's get out of here, (Out of here) to a private affair
It's truth or dare and I'm not scared
You're almost there, we got something to share

Turn the lights off, I feel the spot
Can you make me glow in the dark? Cause I wanna glow in the dark!
Hey-ey-ey
Turn the lights off, it's about to start
Can you make me glow in the dark? Cause I wanna glow in the dark!
Hey-ey-ey
Glow in the dark
Glow in the dark
Hey-ey-ey
Glow in the dark
Glow in the dark
Hey-ey-ey

Now we're both breathing in the silence
Now we're both phasin' in like diamonds

I wanna glow in the dark!

Turn the lights off, I feel the spot
Can you make me glow in the dark? Cause I wanna glow in the dark!
Hey-ey-ey
Turn the lights off, it's about to start
Can you make me glow in the dark? Cause I wanna glow in the dark!
Hey-ey-ey
Glow in the dark, yeah
