I've seen your fairground hair, your seaside eyes
Your vampire tooth, your little truth and your tiny lies
And I know your trembling hand, your guilty prize
Your sleeping limbs, your foreign hymns and your midnight cries

So dry your eyes
And turn your head away
Now there's nothing more to say
Now you're gone away

I know your trail of tears, your slip of hand
Your monkey claw, your monkey paw and your monkey hand
And I've seen your trick of blood, your trap of fire
Your ancient wound, your scarlet moon, your jail house smile

So dry your eyes
And turn your head away
Now there's nothing more to say
Now you're gone away

So dry your eyes
And turn your head away
Now there's nothing more to say
Now you're gone away

I'll miss your urchin smile, your orphan tears
Your shining prize, your tiny cries, your little fears
And I'll miss your fairground hair, your seaside eyes
Your little truth, your vampire tooth and your tiny lies

So dry your eyes
And turn your head away
Now there's nothing more to say
Now you're gone away

So dry your eyes
And turn your head away
Now there's nothing more to say
Now you're gone away

So dry your eyes
And turn your head away
Now there's nothing more to say
Now you're gone away
