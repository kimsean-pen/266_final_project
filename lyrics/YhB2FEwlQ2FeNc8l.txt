I can't hear any words they say
I swear I must have lost the frame
Well, my friends think my soul is dead (thanks man)
But I'm just trapped in my own head

And I cry you cry
Cause we don't lie
The way things change
And I hold it down but I ain't the same
You keep goin', keep goin'
You have to keep goin', you keep goin'
Well you keep goin', you keep goin', ya
You keep goin', you have to keep goin'

And you have to keep goin'

There is nothing that I can do
Just waiting for something new
And the time is swell before you even know
It's gone, ya, ya

And I cry, and you cry
Cause we don't lie
The way things change
And I hold it down but I ain't the same
You keep goin', keep goin'
You have to keep goin', you keep goin'
Well keep goin', you keep goin', ya
You keep goin', you have to keep goin'

And you have to keep goin'
And you have to keep goin'

And I cry, and you cry
Cause we don't lie
The way things change (change)
And I hold it down but I ain't the same
You keep goin', girl, keep goin', goin'
Keep goin', you keep goin'
You keep goin', you have to keep goin'
