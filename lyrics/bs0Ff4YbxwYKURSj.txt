There's blood in the sky,
It bleeds from the land

Behind those eyes,
Diamonds turn to sand.

Such a beautiful fall,
I saw the surface break,

The water's so cold,
Your body shakes.

On a stormy day the clouds move too fast to see,
The shapes they make or how they wrap,
Our little world right up.

Ohhhhhh!
I'm in your garden, but I want a forest.
I'm in god's garden,
I'll make it a forest,
I'll make it a forest.

You cut your ideas, in your own way,
The silly little plans, the games you play.

You try to make me lose faith,
We're all made that way.

There's a diamond in the rough,
There's a needle in the hay.

On a stormy day the clouds move too fast to see,
The shapes they make or how they wrap,
Our little world right up.

Ohhhhhh!
I'm in your garden, but I want a forest,
I'm in god's garden,
I'll make it a forest...

I'm in your garden, but I want a forest,
I'm in god's garden,
I'll make it a forest,
I'll make it a forest.
