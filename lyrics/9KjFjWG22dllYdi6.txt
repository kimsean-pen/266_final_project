Are you aware
Of how much you complicate me?
And are you aware?
Your words suffocate me

And don't deny
You're talking behind my back to your friends
And don't deny
One day you'll need me, need me

All my life I've been looking for the answers
To the questions you never asked
And we never planned on this disaster
When will I let it go?

So incomplete
Your stare is cold unlike anything I've ever seen
So incomplete
Your body is tired and falling apart at the seams

I won't deny
I took a part in ever wanting you back
Don't deny
One day you'll need me, need me

All my life I've been looking for the answers
To the questions you never asked
And we never planned on this disaster
When will I let it go?

All my life I've been looking for the answers
To the questions, you never asked
And we never planned on this disaster
When will I let it go?

If it's tonight
Please let me know
If it's tonight
Why don't you let me know?

All my life I've been looking for the answers
To the questions you never asked
And we never planned on this disaster
When will I let it go?

All my life I've been looking for the answers
To the questions you never asked
And we never planned on this disaster
When will I let it go?

All my life I've been looking for the answers
We never planned on this disaster
