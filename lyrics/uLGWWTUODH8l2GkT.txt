Where did I go wrong?
Was I just chasing a ghost or am I losing control?

Feels like my body is falling apart inside
A constant struggle of knowing what's wrong or right
But her voice still calls me like a siren's song

The cold blue fills my lungs
The pressure building so fast, building so fast
As my senses are falling apart
Her grip is tight as the spell she cast

So hard to breathe, can't catch my breath
Feels like an anchor's tied to my chest
I'm drifting away so far from home
Don't let me sink to the ocean's floor

Don't let me sink
Whispers and secrets flood my ears
This is wrong but I'm locked as she nears

Feels like my body is falling apart inside
A constant struggle of knowing what's wrong or right
But her voice still calls me like a siren's song

I fell for the demon's eyes
And the lonely sounds of her piercing cries

So hard to breathe, can't catch my breath
Feels like an anchor's tied to my chest
I'm drifting away so far from home
Don't let me sink to the ocean's floor
So hard to breathe, can't catch my breath
Feels like an anchor's tied to my chest
I'm drifting away so far from home
Don't let me sink to the ocean's floor
To the ocean's floor

If this is the end for me, would you please let me go?
I'm so tired of holding on
This is the end for me, why won't you let me go?
Just let me go

So hard to breathe, can't catch my breath
Feels like an anchor's tied to my chest
I'm drifting away so far from home
Don't let me sink
So hard to breathe, can't catch my breath
Feels like an anchor's tied to my chest
I'm drifting away so far from home
Don't let me sink

Don't let me
Don't let me sink
