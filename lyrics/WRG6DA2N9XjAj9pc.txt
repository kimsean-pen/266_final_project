Put your hands together everybody!
Aiaiaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
Yeah!
Don't let no small frustration
Ever bring you down (no, no, no, no)

Just take a situation
And turn it all around

With a new attitude everything can change

Make it how you want it to be
Staying mad, why do that, give yourself a break
Laugh about it and you'll see! (Come on!)
Life's what you make it

So let's make it rock (Make it rock!)
Life's what you make it

Why be sad, broken-hearted
There's so much to do (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Life's is hard, or it's party (It's party!)
The choice is up to you!
With a new attitude everything can change
Make it how you want it to be

Staying sad, why do that, give yourself a break
I know you wanna party with me (Woow!)

So let's make it rock
Life's what you make it
So come on (Come on!), come on, (everybody now)!
