Yeah, the simple things dig the deepest holes
If the finest lines, they cut the most
There's a touch of blues, that I just can't shake
And it's bittersweet, but I love the taste

When it strikes your eye
You're gonna find that it sparks your soul
Ohoh, ohoh

When I'm looking at you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I'm a wandering ship in a sea of fools
Yeah, it's true-ue-ue-ue-ue-ue-ue
If you only had half the love I'm feeling for you

You give me just enough to keep me on my toes
But when I make a mood, I'm dancing on my own
So are you ever gonna give in to me?
Are you ever gonna break?
Is this another lost cause?
Will you ever feel the same?

When it strikes your eye
You're gonna find that it sparks your soul
Ohoh, ohoh

When I'm looking at you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I'm a wandering ship in a sea of fools
Yeah, it's true-ue-ue-ue-ue-ue-ue
If you only had half the love I'm feeling for you
If you only had half the love I'm feeling for you

Yeah, the simple things dig the deepest holes
You're the sweetest kind, that hurts the most

When it strikes your eye
You're gonna find that it sparks your soul
Ohoh, ohoh, ohoh, ohoh

When I'm looking at you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I'm a wandering ship in a sea of fools
Yeah, it's true-ue-ue-ue-ue-ue-ue
If you only had half the love I'm feeling for you
If you only had half the love I'm feeling for you

You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
