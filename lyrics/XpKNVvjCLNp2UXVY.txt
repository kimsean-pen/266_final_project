I had daydreams of flying
If only for a moment
I was soaring in flight
Then you caught up with me

What's the use of being free
All that's left is you and me
Trapped together from the start
Tear each other's world apart
With our endless hopes and dreams
Watch us fighting hear our screams
Playing with the poison of love

I was so complacent
Never had a thought
That I'd lose my freedom
Ever get caught

What's the use of being free
All that's left is you and me
Trapped together from the start
Tear each other's world apart
With our endless hopes and dreams
Watch us fighting hear our screams

Fighting with the poison of love
