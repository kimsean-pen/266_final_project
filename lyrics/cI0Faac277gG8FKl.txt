"Simpsons" season 3 and a thing of hummus
This is all I need
I'm, like, super low-maintenance

But every now and then I wonder why
Just a little bit

I'm slackin' all over the floor
A snail-trail of lazy wherever I go
I'm slackin' all over the floor

Maybe I should read or watch the opera
That don't sound like me
It seems super high-maintenance

But every now and then I wonder why
Just a little bit

I'm slackin' all over the floor
A snail-trail of lazy wherever I go
I'm slackin' all over the floor

And if I do everything that I should
When do I do nothing at all?
