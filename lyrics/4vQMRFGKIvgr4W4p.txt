Hands are hanging lying in a box
Breaking after seeing little dogs
We'll close the windows tonight
It's too cold for cold you to go outisde

She's my chowder, and I lover her so much
She's my chowder, and I lover her so much
She's my chowder, and I lover her so much
She's my chowder, and I lover her so much

Sitting there just staring at the trees
Trolling for a little love that??
We'll lock the door behind tonight
And leave a light on for your eyes

She's my chowder, and I lover her so much
She's my chowder, and I lover her so much
She's my chowder, and I lover her so much
She's my chowder, and I lover her so much
