If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when, tell me if you see Kay
If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when, tell me if you see Kay

She said I won the battle but I lost the war,
And now my head is sore,
And if I try and sail back in she's gonna push me from the shore,
Now I won't ever get the time or day,
No way no way no,
Not for what I said but for what I didn't say,
What I didn't say

So if you see Kay will you tell her that I love her,
And if you see Kay let her know I want her back,
If she listens say I miss her,
Everything about her,
Make sure you say I'm sweet F.A. without her,
If you see Kay

If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when, tell me if you see Kay
If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when, tell me if you see Kay

She got me saying sorry through the door,
She don't care anymore,
She says it's to late now should have thought of this before,
But I aint gonna take this as defeat,
No way no way no,
Cause I'm gonna shout it out to everyone I, everyone I meet

So if you see Kay will you tell her that I love her,
And if you see Kay let her know I want her back,
If she listens say I miss her,
Everything about her,
Make sure you say I'm sweet F.A. without her,
If you see Kay

Now I'm sitting here in disbelief,
How it truly broke my heart to have to watch her leave,
But she was torn between what she wants and what she needs,
They say you love someone enough you've gotta set them free,
She said that she was born to leave this town behind,
Knew the truth but still she looked me in the eyes and lied,
Saying it's time to cut the ties,
Time to say goodbye,
So she left,
But she never never left my,
Never never left my mind

So if you see Kay will you tell her that I love her,
And if you see Kay let her know I want her back,
If she listens say I miss her,
Everything about her,
Make sure you say I'm sweet F.A. without her,
And make sure you say I lost my way without her,
If you see Kay

If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when, tell me if you see Kay
If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when, tell me if you see Kay
If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when, tell me if you see Kay
If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when, tell me if you see Kay
