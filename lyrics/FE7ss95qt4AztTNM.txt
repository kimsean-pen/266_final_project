In the silhouette of your shadow
And I don't know if we'll be here tomorrow
And in fear it may appear
I don't feel a thing
But maybe I'm a mess, maybe I'm a mess

Emerald green peering through the seams

This pain I'm waiting for
Out of my control something in my soul
So terrible
Sustain, decay
Holding on for more, fallen to the floor
Unbearable

On the inside of me, the walls are hollow
The screams are echoing
Can't silence anything
And the sin will follow

Emerald green peering through the seams

This pain I'm waiting for
Out of my control something in my soul
So terrible
Sustain, decay
Holding on for more, fallen to the floor
Unbearable

The screams are echoing
Can't silence anything
And the walls are caving in
The screams are echoing
Can't silence anything
And the walls are caving in
The screams are echoing
Can't silence anything
And the walls are caving in
The screams are echoing
Can't silence anything
Can't silence anything

This pain I'm waiting for
Out of my control something in my soul
So terrible
Sustain, decay
Holding on for more, fallen to the floor
Unbearable (unbearable)
