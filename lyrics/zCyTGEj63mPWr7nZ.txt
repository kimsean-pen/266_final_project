Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up with the woods among the Evergreens
There Stood an old cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B Goode
But never ever learned to read or write so well,
but he could play a guitar just like ringing bell

Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!
Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go seat beneath the trees by the railroadtrack
All engineers sitting in the shade
stumming with the rhytm that the drivers made
The people passing by, they stopped and said,
"Oh my, but how that country boy can play"

Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!
Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!
Johhnny B Goode! Go Johnny!

His mother told him someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from a miles around
To hear you play your music till the sun goes down
Maybe someday you name will be in lights,
saying Johnny B Goode To night

Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!
Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!
Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!
Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!
Johnny B Goode
Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!
Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!
Johnny B Goode
Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!
Johnny B Goode
Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!
Johnny B Goode
