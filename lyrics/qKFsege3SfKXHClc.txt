You've given your all, never a day off
You're here with the best and it's paid off
Showing the world that you can take it
Proving to yourself that you can make it

You must keep on
Fighting, be strong
There is no gain
Without some pain

I'm on fire (I'm on fire)
I'm on fire (I'm on fire)

Go, it's time to let everybody see
Be the greatest that you can be
Just let the winner in you be free
I'm on fire

Now it's the time to show 'em who's who
Taking the stage and all the eyes on you
Doing it right always your one thought
The only way to win is giving all you got

You must keep on
Fighting, be strong
There is no gain
Without some pain

I'm on fire (I'm on fire)
I'm on fire (I'm on fire)

Go, it's time to let everybody see
Be the greatest that you can be
Just let the winner in you be free
I'm on fire

You've given your all, never a day off
You're here with the best and it's paid off
Showing the world that you can take it
Proving to yourself that you can make it

You must keep on
Fighting, be strong
There is no gain
Without some pain

I'm on fire (I'm on fire)
I'm on fire (I'm on fire)

Go, it's time to let everybody see (Let everybody see)
Be the greatest that you can be
Just let the winner in you be free
I'm on fire
