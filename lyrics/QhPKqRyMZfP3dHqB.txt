Broken glass, is luxury
Friendly fires, or alchemy
Daylight is the enemy
Witching hour, soft power

We're not sleeping at the wheel
The wheel is turning the machine,
that kills for us

Close your eyes, so your not seeing
and valentines daydream

We're not sleeping at the wheel
The wheel is turning the machine,
that kills for us

The hourglass of the forests
Setting fire to the tourists

We're not sleeping at the wheel
The wheel is turning the machine,
that kills for us

Broken glass, is luxury
Friendly fires, or alchemy
Daylight is the enemy
Witching hour, soft power
