In the air I flew
Through the clouds I fall
Through the country I've walked
In front of temples I've stood
Before the ocean I pray
And I said your name

In the air I flew
Through the clouds I fall
And all the things I've tried to say
Were never easy to explain
They were always meant for you

And all the memories that were made
For years and years
I've chased this day
They were always for you
Always for you

In the air I breath
Through the clouds I see
Through the cities I've walked
In the castles I dreamed
On the mountain I climb
When I call your name

In the air I flew
Through the clouds I've fell
And all the things I've tried to change
Were never easy to contain
They were always meant for you
(always for you)

And all the memories will never fade
For years and years
In my heart you'll stay
It was always for you
Always for you
Always for you

And all the pieces that remain
They will build a place for us to stay
They were always meant for you
(always for you)

And all the chances that we take
For years and years
We'll have this place
They were always for you
Always for you
