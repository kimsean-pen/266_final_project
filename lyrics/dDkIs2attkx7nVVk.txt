Don't wanna see your tears
Baby it'll be ok
Don't wanna see you cry darlin'
No way! (ooooh)
But it just don't feel the same
(just don't feel the same)
I know what you're about
(I know what you're about)
And I guess that I don't love you anymore
And I'm sorry, but it just ain't working out

I'm sorry it just ain't gonna work out
(just ain't gonna work out girl)
I'm sorry it just ain't gonna work out
(just ain't gonna work out girl)

Don't want you to be sad girl
Don't want you to be afraid
I know that will you understand my ways
One day! (oooh)
No need to be upset girl
(you just don't understand)
Please don't scream and shout
(Please don't scream and shout)
I know that you were hearing wedding bells
But I'm sorry
'Cause it just ain't working out

I'm sorry it just ain't gonna work out
(just ain't gonna work out girl)
I'm sorry it just ain't gonna work out
(just ain't gonna work out girl)
