You know it's flying, said I can try it
You say I feel well, I know I love you

I always try to find the way and every place can wait for day

You know it's flying, I'm always trying
I said I feel well, who wants to love me?

I always try to find the way and every place can wait for day
Who knows the stars can illuminate, who wants to (?) cigarette?

You know it's flying, I'm always trying
You know that I feel well, I'm always lying

I always try to find the way and every place can wait for day
I always try to find the way and every place can wait for day
Who knows the stars can illuminate, who wants to (?) cigarette?
It's just the same
