Whassup shorty?
Who is you?
Oh nigga wassup man I couldn't even see you
I'm in this bitch chillin like Stevie Wonder

I got ray ban vision, these ain't no prescriptions
I see you haters coming niggas don't think that I'm slippin
I got ray ban vision, I wear 'em when I'm whippin
I wear 'em when I'm fucking all my women think I'm trippin
I got ray ban vision
I got ray ban vision
I got ray ban vision
I got ray ban vision
I got ray ban vision
This how I'm living, the only time I look you in the eye if we doin business

I got ray ban vision

I'm back up in this, feelin tremendous lenses darker than the tint on my benzes
I got ya bitch flippin like a gymnast
She told me take my glasses off but she looks horrendous
Caravans on my face lookin vintage, 3 pair of these bitch, cost what your rent is
Niggas wasn't wearin these, now it's a trend shit
I had my first pair of ray bans when I was ten tricks
Prynce is lookin like a pilot out the air force
Came to the club fresh up out the airport
I'm like Tom Cruise I'm from Top Gun (Why?)
Cause they know that's where I'm at, plus I got one
I keep my shades on in the hot sun

Old school Datsun, stunt so hard it's not funny
I'm with the playboy bunny and she's still a dime, even when her hair is not done

I got ray ban vision, these ain't no prescriptions
I see you haters coming niggas don't think that I'm slippin
I got ray ban vision, I wear 'em when I'm whippin
I wear 'em when I'm fucking all my women think I'm trippin
I got ray ban vision
I got ray ban vision
I got ray ban vision
I got ray ban vision
I got ray ban vision
This how I'm living, the only time I look you in the eye if we doin business
I got ray ban vision

I seen it all through the mirror tints, I knew a girl who's innocence would disappear with Prynce
I got my hand in between her legs, she says boy go ahead you gon' make me have a incident
Now we intimate, this is how we ended it left the restaurant now I'm in her mouth like a dinner mint
We started in a parking lot and finish at my teniment
Shorty had a reason, my pippin was legitimate
I tore that pussy up like a ligament
She don't like her man so she asked me for deliverance
I sit back with my ray bans on, I say it ain't my fault that you in that predicament
Cause I treat hoes like Ray Charles, looks ain't shit that's how I play ball
As long as they take off they draws and the whole time we did it I didn't take my shades off

I got ray ban vision, these ain't no prescriptions
I see you haters coming niggas don't think that I'm slippin
I got ray ban vision, I wear 'em when I'm whippin
I wear 'em when I'm fucking all my women think I'm trippin
I got ray ban vision
I got ray ban vision
I got ray ban vision

I got ray ban vision
This how I'm living, the only time I look you in the eye if we doin business
I got ray ban vision

I got ray ban vision, these ain't no prescriptions
