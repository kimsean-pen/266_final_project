I'm an 80's baby, raised by the TV
I wasn't poor but life wasn't easy
Knock on the door, now mama is leaving
Where did dad go?, he'll never see me
Move to new place, go to a new school
Year after year, I'm always the new fool
I had my issues on how I was raised up
Now I have you and my whole life has changed up
But, maybe, one day you could have my baby
Please don't call me crazy
But, maybe you could have my baby
You know you're the one, you know you're the one
I've looked all around, I swear that I'm done
I'll be there for you like nobody else
I'll be by your side through sickness and health
I'll hold your hand, I'll stick to the plan
I'll give you everything I can
I'll step to the plate and I'll be a man
I'll be there for you, don't you understand?
But, maybe, one day you could have my baby
Please don't call me crazy
But, maybe you could have my baby
Maybe you could have my baby
