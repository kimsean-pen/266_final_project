There's a palace a-fallin'
There's a smoke in the sky
There's a boy running down into the lowlands tonight
And he's catching a train to where he's heard you have been
He's a fool now among us but a dreamer within
Dreamin' of you

And on that day there was snowfall in the street, yellow light
And they cleared the bill and rails just by those dark shimmer eyes
In that land there's a winter
In that winter's a day
In that day there's a moment when it all goes all your way
And you know it's a lion's heart
That will tumble and tear apart
When he's comin' down the hills for you

But can you still now remember who's been hiding up there
Through his howling at twilight all his songs of despair
Do you remember the caller of a black and white crime?
Well he lives by that memory and falls through his mind
And you know it's a lion's heart
That will tumble and tear apart
When he's comin' down the hills for you

Well he'll walk in the city forever
Oh, walk in a time to be gone
Well there's no real goodbye if you mean it
So hey, guess I'm forever alone

Now he's a stranger among us, he will die in the park
Where he hides from the statues and the weather remarks
In that land there's a winter
In that winter's a day
In that day there's a moment when it all goes away
And you know it's a lion's heart
That will tumble and tear apart
When it's comin' down the hills for you
