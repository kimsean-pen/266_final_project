On a shameless night
In a nameless place
I forgot love was a hopeless case
Til I found you
Til I found you
Lived a wasteful life in a hateful city
There was no love, just pain and pity
Til I found you
Til I found you
And you don't know how you saved me
And you don't know what you gave me
And you don't know how you saved my life
I can see the light
I have flown away
I have come alive
I am blown away
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
I can live my life
I believe in faith
I have found myself
I have lost the hate
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
On a shameless night
In a nameless place
I forgot love was a hopeless case
Til I found you
Til I found you
Lived a wasteful life in a hateful city
There was no love, just pain and pity
Til I found you
Til I found you
And you don't know how you saved my life
I can see the light
I have flown away
I have come alive
I am blown away
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
All my life I've waited
For this day
I've waited for you
Now I adore you
All my life I've waited
For this day
Have waited for you
Now I adore you
I can see the light
I have flown away
I have come alive
I am blown away
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
