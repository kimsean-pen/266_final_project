You wait up for me, I don't wake up for you
Would you like the company or are you sick of me?
When your love lets you go you only want love more
Even when love wasn't what you were looking for

Speak slow, tell me love, where do we go?
Where do we go? Where do we go?

You break down and plead your case
I don't know what to say
I leave my heart all this pain
And now I'm at it all again

On these streets that I leave
For weeks on end who's to blame
When you want love
Doesn't matter what you're looking for

Speak slow, tell me love, where do we go?
Where do we go? Where do we go?
Speak slow, tell me love, where do we go?
Where do we go? Where do we go? Speak slow

I'm so far away and I just can't see you
I'm so far along and I just don't need you
I am so ah-alone, so ah-alone
So ah-alone, so ah-alone

I'm so far away and I just can't see you
I'm so far along and I just don't need you
I am so ah-alone, so ah-alone
So ah-alone, so ah-alone

When your love lets you go
You only want love more
Even when love wasn't
What you were looking for

When your love lets you go
You only want love more
Even when love wasn't
What you were looking for

Speak slow, tell me love, where do we go?
Where do we go? Where do we go?
Speak slow, tell me love, where do we go?
Where do we go? Where do we go? Speak slow, speak slow
