And now I know the only compass that I need is the one that leads back to you.
And I know the only compass that I need, oh is the one that leads back to you.

And the burning blisters on my feet will calm,
So hold me as I m close to flaw.
Away from the warmth of your arms I stay,
off the radar and into harms way.

Now I know the only compass that I need, oh is the one that leads back to you.

Yeah, coffee will raise the head again,
cokes that lead us from the pain.
Words just sit like empty scribbles,
such empty caffeinated widows.

Now I know the only compass that I need is the one that leads back to you.
Now I know the only compass that I need, oh is the one that leads back to you.
