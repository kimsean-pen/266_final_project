You say your life's just a drag
'Cause everything you ever wanted, you had
But, but, but now you can't complain
But all you do is complain
And you're moving out
To, to, to, to higher ground
Where all the stars hang out
And all the money's found

Were you blinded by the lies?
Were you blinded by the lies?
Were you looking for some fame like a moth to the flame?
Were you blinded by the lights?
Big city lights, bright lights, big city

Well, you can't sit still
And you're climbing a wall
But you know that you can't complain
But all I do is complain
'Cause I'm broke and that's no joke
Left looking at the silver screen
When you're born with a silver spoon

Were you blinded by the lies?
Were you blinded by the lies?
Were you looking for some fame like a moth to the flame?
Were you blinded by the lights?
Big city lights, bright lights, big, big, big

(You know, you know, you know what they said?)
Aw, kick 'em in the face
Kick 'em in the face
Kick 'em in the face
Kick 'em in the face, nah nah, li-li-lies

Were you blinded by the lies?
Were you looking for some fame like a moth to the flame?
Were you blinded by the lights?
Big city lights, bright lights, big city lights

Were you blinded by the lies?
Were you blinded by the lights?
Were you blinded by the lies?
Were you blinded by the lights, lights, lights, lights, lights
(Take it home now)
