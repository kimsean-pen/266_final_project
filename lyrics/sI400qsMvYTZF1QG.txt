(One the morning of June 14, 1968
A group of hippies fled into the mountains of Colorado to wait for doomsday)

4 months + 8 days
Been waiting here
Transporter broken
Horizon's clear

(DAY ONE)
No vegetation
Blips on my screen
Whatever was here
Has been disappeared

Now here's alright (x2)
Alright

(DAY TWO)
Wait tower
Radar's going off
I see a small creature
Who can barely walk

My data says "large"
But what I see is small
Text reads "Big Danger"
This just looks tired

Now here's alright (x2)
Alright, alright

(DAY THREE)
Come in tower
All our data's wrong
Research inconsistent
We misread it all

There was no monster
And what's left is near dead
Control killed a phantom
From inside their heads

(Come in, come in
You've lost my screen
Do you respond?
Variable text field is frozen
Look at your monitors
Dont take your eyes off the monitor
We're losing you
Subterra outpost, stay calm
We're losing you
You're going-)

Now here's alright
Nowhere's alright
Alright, alright, alright, al-
