We're burning at the stakes now
Our angels from a far
Have come to live in ghost towns
Their tombs were black and charred

I've seen the messengers
But they were not for me
They said we're all black witches
Part of an industry

War
This is what it sounds like
War
Cries unsyncronized
War
This is what it sounds like
War
To keep us terrified

We keep the cameras rolling
So we can televise
All that we've have been controlling
To keep you mesmerized

Why could the right explosions
Just like the laboratories
Commercialized religions
And their inequaties

War
This is what it sounds like
War
Cries unsyncronized
War
This is what it sounds like
War
To keep us terrified

War
This is what it sounds like
War
Cries unsyncronized
War
This is what it sounds like
War
To keep us terrified

War
This is what it sounds like
War
Cries unsyncronized
War
This is what it sounds like
War
To keep us terrified
