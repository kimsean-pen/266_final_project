Undo me
And feel no restraint
Undo me
Pain is wanting closure
Undo me
The mind it needs to rest
Undo me
I shall be restored

Perseverance doesn't mean anything
Unless it's for eternity
The real powers that'll ever be
Is freedom and liberty

Undo me
And feel no restraint
Undo me
Pain is wanting closure
Undo me
The mind it needs to rest
Undo me
I shall be restored

A lifetime worthy of awakening
Is a life worth transcending

We learn as we teach
We teach as we speak
We speak as we seek
We seek what we learn

Knowing when to end a journey
Is to recognize where it begins
What we really seek is not here
But on the other side of fear

We learn as we teach
We teach as we speak
We speak as we seek
We seek what we learn
