Run run run away so long lost never comin
Home rollin rollin down a track
No no i'm never comin back
Love pumpin in my veins
Our love I hope its not too late
That's the road that's the load that's the role
I've been down i've been down I've been down down
(What's part of forever)

(Don't you understand)

I could stay, stay, stay
if that's what you want, want, want
I'd give it to you, you you
If I had a heart, heart, heart
And we could go, go, go
And never look back on now
I'd give it to you, you, you
If I had a heart, heart, heart

Run, run, run away so long lost never comin
Home rollin rollin down a track
No no i'm never comin back
Love pumpin opening my veins
Our love I hope its not too late
That's the road that's the load that's the role
I've been down I've been down I've been down down
(What's part of forever)

(Don't you understand)

I could stay, stay, stay
if that's what you want, want, want
I'd give it to you, yo, u you
If I had a heart, heart, heart
And we could go, go, go
And never look back on now
I'd give it to you, you, you
If I had a heart, heart, heart

Imagine eternity, doesn't seem that long
They say nothing lasts forever
We'll have to prove them wrong

I could stay, stay, stay
if that's what you want, want, want
I'd give it to you, yo, u you
If I had a heart, heart, heart
And we could go, go, go
And never look back on now
I'd give it to you, you, you
If I had a heart, heart, heart
