Kick me when I'm down
Keep me on the ground
From the ones who I thought they would never leave
Who gave you so much faith?
Who gave you so much power?
You turned it all against me

I'm feeling alive like it's the first time
But you're goin' and you're goin' and you're gone tonight
I'm feeling alive like it's the first time
Never gonna be a part of me this time

I know you'll write me off
I know you're always gonna count me out
You think I'm gonna let you down?
I know you'll write me off
I know you're always gonna count me out
You think I'm gonna let you down?
Just wait, just wait, just wait

Kick me when I'm down
Keep me on the ground
There's no black and white when it comes to pain
All I gave up, it's still not enough
You're twisting my demons like there is no love
When push comes to shove that fine line gives up
I'm left with the feeling of chasing a rush

I'm feeling alive like it's the first time
But you're goin' and you're goin' and you're gone tonight
I'm feeling alive like it's the first time
Never gonna be a part of me this time

I know you'll write me off
I know you're always gonna count me out
You think I'm gonna let you down?
I know you'll write me off
I know you're always gonna count me out
You think I'm gonna let you down?
Just wait

Gonna show what I've got left
You haven't even seen my best
Just wait

All I gave up
Still not enough
Kick me when I'm down

I know you'll write me off
I know you're always gonna count me out
You think I'm gonna let you down?
I know you'll write me off
I know you're always gonna count me out
You think I'm gonna let you down?
Just wait

Don't count me out
Won't let you down
I'm never gonna let you down
(Don't count me out, don't count me out)
(Don't write, I won't let you down)
