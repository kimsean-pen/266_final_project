I made my home in a ten-ton bomb
And I was so happy with 28 years of free falling
But now it's all guts and I'm bawlin'

She was born in a tenement walk-up
With shit for nerves, you know she never learned to talk to adults
She said "everything's easier in here"

Like the dancer with bruises who gathers the cash
When the music is through, no she don't look back
I've come to look for America too

All I ever wanted was a spot in the mountains
With an a-frame cabin and nobody counting our days
Or cursing or praising on name
But the best we could do is to enter the void
Like a wide-eyed child waking up to the noise of East Harlem
Don't they see that we're starving?

Like the dancer with bruises who gathers the cash
When the music is through no she don't look back
I've come to look for America too

And we stole the car on the 4th of July
I pawned my guitar and we drove through the night
I've come to look for America too
I've come to look for America too
I've come to look for America too

Like the dancer with bruises who gathers the cash
When the music is through no she don't look back
I've come to look for America too

And we stole the car on the 4th of July
I pawned my guitar and we drove through the night
I've come to look for America too
I've come to look for America too
I've come to look for America too
