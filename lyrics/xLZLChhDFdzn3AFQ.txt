I m out on the streets, you know
I m looking for you
You give me the sweets, you know
You know I m not through, so
Thank God for the sinners
Thank God for your love
In the morning I ll rise above
There s a whole in my heart, you know

Won t you please just stop, you know
So I can make it through
Thank God for the sinners
Thank God for your love
In the morning I ll rise above
Thank God for the sinners
Thank God for your love
In the morning I ll rise above
