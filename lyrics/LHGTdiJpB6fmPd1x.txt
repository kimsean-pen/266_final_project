In birth, just an ember, a spark of creation
Towards genesis with vision of dominion and godliness
With vision godliness
It will take all you have held
In evolutions design, it will burn up all obstacles
Changing opposition to a carnal ash
With vision godliness
It will take all you have held
Sacred, sacred, sacred, with vision godliness

Stay here till the windows stop burning for your dreams
Till the windows stop burning for your...

From ember to inferno
From ember to inferno

In birth, just an ember, a spark of creation

Sacred, sacred, sacred, with vision godliness

From ember to inferno
From ember to inferno, sacred

In evolutions design it will burn up all obstacles
Changing opposition to a carnal ash
With vision godliness
It will take all you have held
Sacred, sacred, sacred, with vision godliness
