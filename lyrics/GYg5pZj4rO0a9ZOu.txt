Miss mythical,
she's like the Wailing Wall
I pass pass her notes
and she goes "oh honey, it's alright".
When the arrows volley down will you stand with me?
Build a fire out of pages of magazines.
Someone like you don't come around every dynasty.
A swooner, that's what you are.
Top of her class, top of her field of futurists
all the headhunters got her name on their lips.
Yeah she's the spine to our body of friends.
That incandescent girl of Incan descent.
When the arrows volley down will you stand with me?
Build a fire out of pages of magazines.
Someone like you don't come around every dynasty.
A swooner, that's what you are.
Feel my temperature rising,
like a comet colliding.
Feel my temperature rising,
Feel my temperature, feel my temperature.
When the arrows volley down will you stand with me?
Build a fire out of pages of magazines.
Someone like you don't come around every dynasty.
A swooner, that's what you are.
That's what you are.
That's what you are.
That's what you are.
