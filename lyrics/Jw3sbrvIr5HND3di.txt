As it comes to dawn
And he's looking in
Now he's crossing the threshhold
Yeah he's stepping in
And we're scared in the room
Like any wise man would
And now he's starting to talking

And I'm taking dictations
Yeah I'm watching for cues
And never going down there
Not with you

In every sense of the word
And every language too
I'm never going down there
Not with you
