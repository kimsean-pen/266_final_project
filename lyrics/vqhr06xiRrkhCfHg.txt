But have you made it out
Out of the ghetto?
Believe in your dreams
Believe you and me, don't let go
We're living it up
We're having a good time baby
I was born uptown of the ghetto dream
Now ain't life crazy?
Daddy made it out
Out of the ghetto
Believe in your dreams
Believe you and me, don't let go
We're living it up
Having a good time baby
I was born uptown of the ghetto dream
Now don't be lazy

Trenchtown have a grandson
Growin' up to be somebody
Gone through the ceilin'
yo me flow phenomenally
I am the kind of thing that doesn't happen normally
I'm a one in a zillion
Yo dawg, if you want some
Good life finally
Perhaps change your night time hobby
Come out of the old crime lobby
And benefit from your wisdom
Me ah gwan livin' top life is better than great
Every other day we pass a duzz on the plate
Ute no ah hustle, we no steal, don't handwipe
Don't for pull no muscle, no it's never too late
Dey gwan sellin' right in a rich people place
Ya likkle rastaman from Trenchtown find di gate
With food in our bled and drinks in our crate
We sing till da neighbour dem wake

Uptown Jamaica born an' raised
On the playground is where I spend most of my days
Earning Babylon and dem dirty wives
While watchin' all the rich kids goin' astray
Uptown Jamaica born an' raised
On the playground is where I spend most of my days
Big city life Kingston, earn more pay
And if you think me sell out
Tell dem ain't no way
So, live it up
Trenchtown to Rema
Riverton, Soulside to jungle
Sherlock, Gyaden to spun glass
The inland, Three Mile to walk to
Portmore, sea view, Spanish Town
Nine Mile, downstown to Flankers
Falmouth, Westside, Orange Hill
