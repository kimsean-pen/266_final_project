Ooh ooh ooh

Your eyes
They speak to me
But I don't know what they are saying
But I think I know you are thinking

So close your eyes
And create yourself a better life
Let the wind blow through your hair
Let the music take you there
And make a better life, better life, hm hm hm hm

You found a lighter
On the street
And suddenly everything just seems so happy, hm hm
My honey, it's all temporary

Just close your eyes
And create yourself a better life
Let the wind blow through your hair
Let the music take you there
And make a better life, a better life, life

So close your eyes
And create yourself a better life
Let the wind blow through your hair
Let the music take you there
And make a better life

A better life
Maybe this time
Things will turn out right
