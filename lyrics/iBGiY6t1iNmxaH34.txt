I just wanna feel
Like my favorite artist still real
Like my daddy still a superhero
Used to wanna be on
106 and Park and talk to Free
Ol' pretty fine ass shoot the b-roll
Shots up, D Rose
Cutie pie, I just wanna slice, oh
Wanna fight, no Kimbo
My life on Vimeo, HD Smi up ya wifi
Long finger chucked up to Reno
I keep it
1 zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero
A milli'
My M.O., STL my kinfolk
My gal break her back like limbo
Just to keep a nigga on tempo
Monte set the metronome
I make the metro boom
We the future, I'm bein' honest
Freed the bands with songs
Zero Gang with me, bitch, but I ain't standing alone
Zero fatigue, ciabatta and cheese
I'm outta my league

Oh yeah, yeah
She wanna hang wimme
I brought the gang with me
Thing about the gang, it ain't no damn fatigue
You crazy
That's what she said to me
Right about the time it hit 6:03
Sun creepin', won't ya dip with me?
Ayy
Oh lady, call your team
Tell 'em you just ran into some royalty
Imagine ya majesty gave you all your dreams
Oh crazy, she wanna dance for me
Dance for me
Shake a lil' ass for me, ass for me

And I'm fucking sears, switching gears
Up this hill, can't slow down
Dusse something, do say something
Else or we'll crash
At my crib, off the shits
With my bitch
Last time she slid
Slipped, bussed my head
Woah, wet floor

I'm from the Lou, Gimme Da Loot
All of my niggas shoot
Pocket on Winne the Pooh
I'm feelin' my juice, she feelin' it too
I'm in a league of my own
Nobody putting me on, huh, huh
Better believe in the ref
Zero fatiguing like Jeff, huh, huh
Pacer with it on rush, nun
She just wanna suck somethin'
Toppy, that's the topic of discussion
She keep a nigga bussin'
Like my wheels bussed, huh, huh
Dumps like a truck, huh, huh

Oh yeah, yeah
She wanna hang with me
I brought the gang with me
Think about the gang, it ain't no damn fatigue
You crazy
That's what she said to me
Right about the time it hit 6:03
Sun creepin', won't yah dip with me
Ayy, ooh lady, call your team
Tell 'em you just ran into some royalty
Imagine ya majesty, gave ya all your dreams
Oh crazy, she wanna dance for me
Dance for me
Shake a lil' ass for me
Ass for me
