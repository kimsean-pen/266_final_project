Oh the time will come up when the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins
The hour when the ship comes in

And the sea will split and the ship will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And then the tide will sound and the wind will pound
And the morning will be breaking

The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And the seagulls they'll be smiling
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean

A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

Then the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'
And the ships wise men will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'

Oh the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real
The hour that the ship comes in
Then they'll raise their hands sayin', "We'll meet all your demands
But we'll shout from the bow your days are numbered"
And like pharaohs tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
And like Goliath, they'll be conquered
