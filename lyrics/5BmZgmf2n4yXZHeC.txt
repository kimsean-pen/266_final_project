Open up your
Open up your
Open up your throat
And let time
All of that time
All of that time
All of that time go

I know it sucks that Daddy's done
But try to think of what you want
You've got to open up your
Open up your
Open up your

Open up your throat

Matt!
Open up your
Open up your

Open up your throat
And let all of that time
All of that time
All of that time

All of that time go
I know it sucks that Daddy's done
But try to think of what you want
You've got to open up your
Open up your

Open up your throat
Matt!
Support your brother / Sport Brother
You got to weigh what you say
To help you shape the way you play

You gotta get rid of the mourning
Sort out the habits of your mind
You've got his way and what he said
To help you shape the way you play
You've got to get rid of the more
Conservative habits of your mind
You've got his way and what he said
To help you shape the way you play
You've got to get rid of the more
Conservative habits of your mind
You've got his way and what he said
To help you shape the way you play
You've got to get rid of the more
Conservative habits of your mind
Woo!
Matt!
You're halfway 'til you're fully grown
You've got a real good shot
Won't help to hold inside
Give a real, give a real
Shout out
Until you're fully grown
You've got a real good shot
Won't help to hold inside
Give a real, give a real
Shout out
You're halfway 'til to fully grown
You've got a real good shot
Won't help to hold inside
Give a real, give a real
Shout out
Matt!!
