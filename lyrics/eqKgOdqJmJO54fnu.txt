False hope
Spreads like a disease
The curtain is drawn
And there's no shepherd for the sheep
Time waits for no man
It's expiring
The pendulum swings back and forth
But no one loses sleep

Disarray
Control is an illusion
The walls are gonna cave
Disarray
Mask the delusion
Until there's nothing left to save

Pinned between
The gears of the machine
Bliss is ignorance
Nowhere else to be
And while they gaze up
At the smoky screen
The perfect time
Line it up
Soak it all in gasoline

Disarray
Control is an illusion
The walls are gonna cave
Disarray
Mask the delusion
Until there's nothing left to save

Til there's nothing left to save
The walls are gonna cave
There's nothing left to save
The walls are gonna cave
There's nothing left to save
The walls are gonna cave
The walls are gonna cave

Disarray
Control is an illusion
The walls are gonna cave

Disarray
Control is an illusion
The walls are gonna cave
Disarray
Mask the delusion
Until there's nothing left to save
