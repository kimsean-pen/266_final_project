Ideate:

There is a silhouette shaped as a human
Carrying death with a merciless scorn
Fed by ideals and doctrines of terror
Warrants his act with the crown of thorns.

And he is out there to take, out there to separate
Out there to break us.

Guided by voices perceived as their saviour
They leave their refuge embracing hope
Some of them drown led astray by his pledges
Some of them hang from an undeserved rope.

So you should stay away, see another day
Stay away now
Please won't you stay away, claim another day
Stay away now.
