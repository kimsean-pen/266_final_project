I've scribbled out my view on faith
On waiting until timing's right
I've sat and pondered on this for days
And days and night and nights and nights
I've never been the best with lines
I've got seventeen pantomimes
That give away the words I say
Are nothing that you should believe

All we are is a bittersweet sundown
Little bit love and a little bit letdown
I can't keep you around
I can't keep you around
In this bittersweet sundown

I've had a lot of time to think
About where this all went south
I wanted you less and less until none and done
And now we're all sold out
You can tell me we'll be just fine
Quentin says you've got twenty pantomimes
That give away my first mistake
Was not convincing you to believe

That all we are is a bittersweet sundown
Little bit love and a little bit letdown
I can't keep you around
I can't keep you around
In this bittersweet sundown

Trust me when I say
You'd make all the same mistakes
And every promise would be made to break
You'd make all the same mistakes
If you knew that you could get away
I'd let you get away
I'd let you get away

All we are is a bittersweet sundown
You gave me every bit of your heart
And I'm the one that let you down
I can't keep you around
I can't keep you around
In this bittersweet sundown
We're a bittersweet sundown
We're a bittersweet memory now
