One day
the shadows will surround me
Some day
the days will come to end
Some time

I'll have to face the real me
Somehow
I'll have to learn to bend
And now I see clearly
All these times

I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time

I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologize
(Whooaah)

I apologize
(Whooaah)

One day
I'll face the hell inside me

Some day
I'll accept what I have done
Some time
I'll leave the past behind me

For now
I accept who I've become
And now I see clearly
All these times
I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time
I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologize
I apologize
One day
the shadows will surround me
All these times
I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time
I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologize
I apologize
(Whooaah)
I apologize
(Whooaah)
I apologize
(Whooaah)
I apologize
(Whooaah)
I apologize
I apologize
