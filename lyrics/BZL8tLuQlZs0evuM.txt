Chasing, yeah, yeah

I'm down on my luck
So I, I'm down for too much
Would you come a little closer when we post up
Make the most of this rush
Mind's racing, eyes blurry
Your body's shaking, no worries
Are you down on your luck?
Are you down for this much?

I open a bottle of champagne and pass it to you
You need a man to ease your mind, I'm loving on you
Baby girl you feel alone?
turn up and let it go

Me and my crew
Staying out late, sit inside and wait but most days
You can find us kicking it low key here
Me and my crew
Living so fast and so hard, chasing hearts

Said it's our ways (Chasing... hearts)
Kicking it low key most days

Down on my luck
Cause I've been living too much
There's nowhere that I'd rather be
Than post up making slow love with you

My mind's racing, eyes are blurry
Bacardi chasing, no worries
And I don't wanna give it up
But I'm out of touch with you
Being down for too much

I open a bottle, there's no pain and nothing on you
You need a man to ease your mind I'm loving on you
Baby girl you feel alone?
Just turn up and let it go

Me and my crew
Staying out late, sit inside and wait but most days
You can find us kicking it low key here
Me and my crew
Living so fast and so hard, chasing hearts

Said it's our ways (Chasing... hearts)
Kicking it low key most days

It's hard to find something new
Trying to find the love in you, oh oh
Champagne chasing (no pain)
(You can) trust me, oh
Me and my crew, just turn up and let it go
Staying out late, sit inside and wait but most days
You can find us kicking it low key here
Me and my crew
Living so fast and so hard, chasing hearts
Said it's our ways (Chasing... hearts)
Kicking it low key most days
