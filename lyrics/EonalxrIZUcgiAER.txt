I learned trouble from a very young age
Might be looking for a savior, but don't wanna be saved
You don't wanna hear the truth
You don't wanna hear the truth
And don't be fooled by the way I like to touch your hand
'Cause I can love you
I can kill you with the very same breath
You only fall in love
And I'm only gonna run

I thought I told you, so don't say I didn't warn you

I always told you that the good girls don't lie
I always told you that the good girls don't lie
I'm always on the run, always on the run
I always, always, always told you
I always told you that the good girls don't lie
You're on your knees when you should run for your life
I'm only gonna run
I'm only gonna run
I always, always, told you good girls don't lie

I'll be your nightmare, baby, when your eyes are shut
But you're gonna love this nightmare, you won't wanna wake up
Like a tattoo on your mind
I wanna be tattooed on your mind
But the truth disappear now before you
Now I'm protecting what's left here of me
That's why I'm always gonna run
I'm only telling you from love
And I thought I told you
So don't say I didn't warn you

I always told you that the good girls don't lie
I always told you that the good girls don't lie
I'm always on the run, always on the run
I always, always, always told you
I always told you that the good girls don't lie
You're on your knees when you should run for your life
I'm only gonna run
I'm only gonna run
I always, always, told you good girls don't lie

You'd never change me, I want you to chase me
Mama told me boys will hurt
Before they do, you better hurt them first
You'd never change me, I want you to chase me
Mama said you'd better hurt them first
Always told me that a good girl don't lie
My mama always told me that a good girl don't lie, oh no

I always told you that the good girls don't lie
I always told you that the good girls don't lie
I'm always on the run, always on the run
I always, always, always told you
I always told you that the good girls don't lie
You're on your knees when you should run for your life
I'm only gonna run
I'm only gonna run
I always, always, told you good girls don't lie
