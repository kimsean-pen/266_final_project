My selfish heart wasn't bit no good to you
At least not the way it intended to, ooh
Your love was young, but it wound my old soul
When I said goodbye I wasn't ready, no no
But I don't wanna waste your time
No, you deserve to find the love of your life
One day you'll marry such a lovely wife
And hopefully we'll be fine!
But baby let's keep in touch, ooh
'Cause I'm not what you need
But I'ma miss you so much
I'm too focused on this dream,
Your kiss is a drug that pulls me back so quick
Until I pull us apart, forgive my selfish heart

Hey, baby let's keep in touch
You got my number baby, go ahead and call it up
You got my number baby, go ahead and call it up
You got my number baby, go ahead and call it up
Go ahead and call it up, go ahead and call it up

You are the best, but I'm never gon' let you know
Each and every day you call me beautiful
You deserve to know the worst is soon gon' come around
And it breaks my heart to have to let you down
But I don't wanna waste your time
No, you deserve to find the love of your life
One day you'll marry such a lovely wife
And hopefully we'll be fine!
Baby let's keep in touch, ooh
'Cause I'm not what you need
But I'ma miss you so much
I'm too focused on this dream,

Until I pull us apart, oh forgive my selfish heart

Hey, baby let's keep in touch
You got my number baby, go ahead and call it up
You got my number baby, go ahead and call it up
You got my number baby, go ahead and call it up
Go ahead and call it up, go ahead and call it up

You got my number baby, go ahead and call it up
Sorry I couldn't make it work, I had to call it off
But you were the best in bed, yeah I can't deny
You know to turn me on, you're one of a kind
But I'm gone 'cause I be swerving
I couldn't give you the time you were deserving
And I admit that I was stupid when I threw your love away
But I hope that we can still be okay

Baby let's keep in touch, ooh
