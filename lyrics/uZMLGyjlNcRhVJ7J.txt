Take me back to California
To those crystal neon signs
The traveling sensation, I'm blinded by the light
There are eyes on every corner
Blow your brains and [?] and smile
Coats of many colors
Flying high up in the sky

Oh won't you come round my way
For some conversation, please
Won't you come round my way
It's a conversation piece
Look at all these shattered faces
They all look so out of place
They've got nothing left to live for
They'll be dead before they wait

I'd love to know just what you're thinking
Tell me what I ought to do
I will be here if lonely, you're the one I'm [?]

Get me out of California
Take out there to the blue
We could make it out together
To the places calling you

Won't you come round my way
For some conversation, please
Won't you come round my way
It's a conversation piece

Oh won't you come round my way
For some conversation, please
Oh won't you come round my way
For some conversation, please
Oh, won't you come round my way
It's a conversation piece
