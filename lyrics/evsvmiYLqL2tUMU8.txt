Take a trip, follow me
To the sun, to the sea
Crystal hair in the breeze
Gonna let it fall over me
Take your hands off the wheel
Take em off, take em off
Let it go, let it breathe
Take some time, come with me

I've never been one to wait
So give me your everything
'Cause every time you look at me
I see myself in your eyes
I see myself in your eyes

Night swims in the rain
Wanna take a trip, hope to strafe
Fingertips on your waist
You and I feel the same

I've never been one to wait
So give me your everything
'Cause every time you look at me
I see myself in your eyes
I see myself in your eyes
I see myself in your eyes
I see myself in your eyes

I see you in everything
I see you in everything
I see myself in your eyes
I see you in everything
I see you in everything
I see myself in your eyes
I see you in everything
I see myself in your eyes
I see you in everything
I see myself in your eyes
I see you in everything
I see myself in your eyes
I see you in everything
I see myself in your eyes
I see you in everything
I see myself in your eyes
