Looking in the mirror and all I see is liquor
Wishing I was somewhere else
Pushing through the bodies 'cause I only want your body
Wish I didn't look like hell

I get confused
Putting labels on things makes 'em complicated
Don't think, just do
When the music gets too loud it's hard to say it

So can we talk later?
Then you can tell me what you want
When we ain't faded
'Cause right now there's smoke in our lungs
After we're naked
When your body says just what it wants
Can we talk, can we talk, can we talk, can we talk?

Spending half my night
And he's reading all the signs
I thought you wanted someone else
But in the hotel lobby you tell me that you want me
I wish I didn't look like hell

I get confused
Putting labels on things makes 'em complicated
Don't think, just do
When the music gets too loud it's hard to say it

So can we talk later?
Then you can tell me what you want
When we ain't faded
'Cause right now there's smoke in our lungs
After we're naked
When your body says just what it wants
Can we talk, can we talk, can we talk, can we talk?
Can we talk, talk, talk?

After the music dies
When we're back at mine
Under faded lights
Can we talk, talk, talk?
After the music dies
When we're back at mine
Under faded lights

Looking in the mirror, my vision's getting clearer
So we should go somewhere else

Where we can we talk later
And you can tell me what you want
If we're still faded
From all this smoke in our lungs
We can get naked
Let your bodies tell me more than once
Can we talk, can we talk, can we talk, can we talk?
Can we talk, talk, talk?

After the music dies
When we're back at mine
Under faded lights
Can we talk, talk, talk?
After the music dies
When we're back at mine
Can we talk, can we talk, can we talk, can we talk?
Later
