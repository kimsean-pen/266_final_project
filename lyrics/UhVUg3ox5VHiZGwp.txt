Quick, assemble a symbol, a solution
You're stalling
Flags tangle in the wind
Slash, slash
Slash, slash

Hyper dark
I think we have a problem
Hyper dark
So, you like trouble
I think we have a problem
Hyper dark

Hey now, big date, tongue in her shade
Then you're going all the way
All those kids
Wasting away
On a yearbook page
That was torn out anyway

Pencil shreds, accolades and certificates
In a trophy case
Retrograde and Gatorade baths
In the middle of May
Slash, slash
In the middle of May
Slash, slash

Hyper dark
I think we have a problem
Hyper dark
So, you like trouble
I think we have a problem
Hyper dark
