Looking for reasons to call you
I just want to hear you say
That you're okay, yeah, you're okay
At least a couple times a day

Still feel sick before I see you
Even though it's been a while
But when you open the door and you look at me
It fades away and I can smile

How can you ever feel sorry?
(How can you ever feel?)
How can you ever love me?
(How can you ever love?)
How can you ever feel less than what you should be?
Less than what you should be

Did you think I was pretending
When I said you were divine?
I'm full of worthless thoughts but even so,
To you I'd never lie
So when you want to tell me secrets
With tears in your lovely eyes
I'll try to comfort you make you feel okay
But on the inside I could die

How can you ever feel sorry?
(How can you ever feel?)
How can you ever love me?
(How can you ever love?)
How can you ever feel less than what you should be?
Less than what you should be
