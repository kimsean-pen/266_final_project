Over and over we climb
And over and over we fall
When all of the time I was standing right here
Where did I go wrong?
And how did I get it right?
Maybe none of it matters right here

We go round
But I know it's never going to tear us apart
We go round
There's an empty ocean you're filling up in my heart

We go round
But I know it's never going to tear us apart
We go round
There's an empty ocean you're filling up in my heart

We go round
But I know it's never going to tear us apart
We go round
There's an empty ocean you're filling up in my heart
We go round
But I know it's never going to tear us apart
We go round
There's an empty ocean you're filling up in my heart
