Once upon the dawn
Day will break
It begins on time
Flowing while it's glowing
It arrives on time

Subjected to origin
Is to know that nothing
Becomes of the contemptible
Waiting for the dawn
Hope to find
I'll cling to my pride

Clearest form
Closest to pure perfection
The essence yet unfolds itself
The chain of strength it holds

Waiting for the dawn
Hope to find
I'll cling to my pride
Reaching from the inside
All I know, night must go

Open the dawn
Behold the purest form
The essence unfolds
The chain of strength you held

As a distant dream
As a distant dream I hover
I call all the stars (call all the stars)
As a distant dream I hover
Call all stars to fall for cover
