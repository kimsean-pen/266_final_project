Hold up your head, and don't let your conscience get you down
Hold up your head darlin', don't let your conscience get you down
If you never lie to me, I'll always be around

You are the same little woman, was so nice and kind to me in every way
You are the same little woman, was so nice and kind to me in every way
But if you never lie to me, I'll be by your side both night and day

You have a strong constitution, and I'm not gonna let you down
You have a strong constitution, and I'm not gonna let you down
And if you never lie to me darlin',
I'll always be around and I won't let you down

Yeah man.
