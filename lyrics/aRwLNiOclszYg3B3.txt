You know what you are, no
You know what you are, no

Don't try to reason
No words, no words
I've seen it all before
Don't cry because it is too late

We make some people
That's all they need to get home
Now look into my eyes
I've seen the light

You know what you are, no

The star starts in the west
We have until we cry
Last time we offer
It's going to slaughter out

His covered eyes
Like in a really happy ending
Don't look into my eyes
You're gonna die

You know what you are, no
You know what you are, no

You know what you are, no

Please don't kill me now
In a house of guilty hate
We go around in circles
Retaliate

Ignore the pain
Ignore the terror
We saw the tears
Lost in their eyes

You know what you are, no
You know what you are, no
