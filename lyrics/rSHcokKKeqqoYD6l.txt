I'm taking off
I've closed the door
As cold as stone
Can't take no more
To be unknown
Is where I go
I choose to walk
This lonely road

Change the flow
'Cause I need the space to grow
Hope you know
I will find my way back home
Back home

I took a step in the water
To see if I float
Dropped me in the deep end
To see if I float
I took a step in the water
Just to know
Just to know
Will I float back home

I'm taking off
I've closed the door
As cold as stone
Can't take no more
To be unknown
Is where I go
I choose to walk
This lonely road

Change the flow
'Cause I need the space to grow
Hope you know
I will find my way back home
Back home

I took a step in the water
To see if I float
Dropped me in the deep end
To see if I float
I took a step in the water
Just to know
Just to know
Will I flow back home

Change the flow
'Cause I need the space to grow
Hope you know
I will find my way back home
Back home

I took a step in the water
To see if I float
Dropped me in the deep end
To see if I float
I took a step in the water
Just to know
Just to know
Will I float back home
