Hey now take a look at you
Who's down in a million dollar suit?
But I knew you when that wasn't you
I knew you when you had a clue
Big man driving a big car
Funny how you can spin so fast so far
I knew you when you was a star
I knew when no one thought you were

You cannot be who I thought you were
Who I thought you were
No, you can't be who I thought you were
Who I thought you were
I like you more when you're boring
You knew I'd be as boring
Come back to get with the???

Are you ever gonna be who I thought you were?

Last time I tried to call you up
I couldn't reach you 'cause you were just so far up
I knew you when you were just rude
I knew I love your attitude
Five minutes all that you got left
Long way down, but I wouldn't hold your breath

I knew you when you knew the time
I knew you for your bottom line

You cannot be who I thought you were
Who I thought you were
No, you can't be who I thought you were
Who I thought you were
I like you more when you're boring

You knew I'd be as boring
Come back to get with the life we owe ya
Are you ever gonna be who I thought you were?

Now you've got a lot to go
Tell your friend it ain't my fault
I know you know better when you're going on that ladder
Got all the girls running here with you
All of your lies are thirsty and you are too

Your enemies are telling you it's all fine
I tell you'd better look when you walk in line
I'd ask you, but I I don't know
It's just like, it's just like I've never seen your face before

You cannot be who I thought you were
Who I thought you were
No, you can't be who I thought you were
Who I thought you were
I like you more when you're boring
You knew I'd be as boring
Come back to get with the life we owe ya
Are you ever gonna be who I thought you were?
Who I thought you were?
Who I thought you were?
Who I thought you were?
