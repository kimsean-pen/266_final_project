Where are you

You never knew yourself well enough, hah
But she never knew you at all
And when she put you out on your own
It may have stolen your innocence but not, no not your soul

Tell me where is little boy blue, ho ho
You'll find him standin' always one step ahead, oh
First a little shy, a little boy blue woh
Wise blood runs warm and deep
On the street, kids walkin', just a kid walkin', just a kid

You send a letter with photographs, ahh
I'll tuck them under my dreams
And if we wake up old beyond our years
Not quite as brave as we seem,
it's just the pain that never disappears

Tell me where is little boy blue, ho ho
You'll find him standin' always one step ahead, oh
First a little shy, a little boy blue, woh
Wise blood runs warms and deep
On the street, kids walkin', just a kid walkin', just a kid

Who! Hey hey
Where are you

When she put you out on your own
It may have stolen your innocence but not, no not your soul
Tell me where is little boy blue, ho ho
You'll find him standin' always one step ahead, oh
First a little shy, a little boy blue, woh woh
Wise blood runs warms and deep
On the street, kids walkin',
just a kid walkin', just a kid walkin', just a kid

Where are you
Where are you
Where are you boy blue
Hey, where are you
You always find him one step ahead
You always find him one step ahead
Ahead
Where are you
Where are you, boy blue
