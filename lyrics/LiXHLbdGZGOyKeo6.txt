(Could be clear
(Black and white)
(Make a decision)
Got a need inside
And I don't know why
It's a strong feeling
That grows and grows

(One day)
My life is out the door
(Next day)
You show me what it's for
(One day)
I think I know myself
(Next day)
You leave me on the shelf

(New moment
(Goes like this)
(Never forbidden)
There's nothing to stop
The thief of time
Stealing the hours
That keep you away

It rushes through my veins
Straight to my head
My mind is a planet
For you to roam

(This is only)
(Just the start)
(It's the beginning)
There's nothing to stop
The thief of time
Stealing the hours
That keep you away

(One day)
My life is out the door
(Next day)
You show me what it's for
(One day)
I think I know myself
(Next day)
You leave me on the shelf

(In this house)
(I call home)
(Living together)
Got a need inside
And I don't know why
It's a strong feeling
And it grows and grows

(One day)
My life is out the door
(Next day)
You show me what it's for
(One day)
I think I know myself
(Next day)
You leave me on the shelf

(This is only)
(Just the start)
(It's the beginning)

(New moment)
(Goes like this)
(Never forbidden)

(Could be clear)
(Black and white)
(Make a decision)
