Here we go
Take a bow
Because we're over now
You were not
There for me
When I needed you and honestly
I think I loved you more
If that's possible
I think I loved you more

(Chorus:)

It's over now and I can't save you
Some things are better left unsaid
And all the promises I made were so stupid
Maybe we'll be able to be friends
If that's possible

Two days gone I'm alright
But you can't sleep at night
What is it you don't like
Are I'm happy now
I was playing with your head
And I close the door
I was cheating when I said
I love you more, yeah

(Chorus:)

It's over now and I can't save you
Some things are better left unsaid
And all the promises I made were so stupid
Maybe we'll be able to be friends
If that's possible

It's over now and I can't save you
Some things are better left unsaid
And all the promises I made were so stupid
Maybe we'll be able to be friends
If that's possible

If that's possible
If that's possible
If that's possible
It's over now
