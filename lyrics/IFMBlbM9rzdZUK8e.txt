Everybody told me to walk away
Though you made me feel good.
I was just a fool, didn't hear them say
Love is like a wild wood.

Something in the way I was lost and found
Something made it feel right.
Spirited away by a haunting sound
Calling in the deep night.

They told me not to listen
To the cry of the lone wolf.
Next time I won't listen
To the cry of the lone wolf.

Following the smoke of your glowing fire
Shining through the twilight,
Then you slipped away as the flames grew higher
Back into the deep night.

They told me not to listen
To the cry of the lone wolf.
Next time I won't listen
To the cry of the lone wolf.
Next time I won't listen
To the cry of the lone wolf.
