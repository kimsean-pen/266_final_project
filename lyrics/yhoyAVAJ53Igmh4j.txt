Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you
For you...
Until the day I die

I'll spill my heart for you
As years go by
I race the clock with you
But if you died right now
You know that I'd die too

I'd die too
You remind me of the times
When I knew who I was (who I was)
But still the second hand will catch us

Like it always does
We'll make the same mistakes
I'll take the fall for you
I hope you need this now

Cause I know I still do
Until the day I die
(Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you

Until the day I die
(Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you
Should I bite my tongue?

Until blood soaks my shirt
We'll never fall apart
Tell me why this hurts so much
My hands are at your throat
And I think I hate you

But still we'll say, "remember when"
Just like we always do
Just like we always do
Until the day I die

(Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you

Until the day I die
(Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you
Yeah I'd spill!

My heart!
Yeah I'd spill!
My heart!
For you!

My hands are at your throat
And I think I hate you

We made the same mistakes
Mistakes like friends do
My hands are at your throat
And I think I hate you
We made the same mistakes
(Made the same mistakes)
Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you
For you...
Until the day I die
(Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you
For you...
Until the day I die
(Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you
Until the day I die
(Until the day I die)
Until the day I die!
