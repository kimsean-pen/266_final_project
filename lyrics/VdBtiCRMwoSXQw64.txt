Numbness, see your fingers turn purple, would you rather burn?
Catching your breath, I'll let you choose your death
Cast your life of agony, I'll dump your body in the sea
I'll drown you while laughing, you know I will destroy you
If chainsaws are your fantasy, I'll cut your body into three
Slicing and grinding, you know that life's not binding
So strangulation is your game, you know I always please to maim
My service to you, to watch your face turn blue

I know your mind, it must be yielding, I'll throw you off a real-tall building
You can't be found, you're splattered on the ground
I'll still your wrist and let you die, you know they'll call it suicide
Blood on the ceiling, I know how you are feeling
If you'd like to be cremated or maybe just decapitated
Speak up now or I'll decide just how
Now you've waited way too long, I knew your mind was not that strong
You've lost your chance, so I will choose your death
