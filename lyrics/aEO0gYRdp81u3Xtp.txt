The moonless Black Hours of Darkness,
Churchyard Necromancy.

Earth and Flame, Bones from a Man,
A blackened Smoke of an Image.

Whispers of ancients hearing our Call,
Master Lucifer.

Mistress' of Earth, Brides of Night.
Witches frenzied Orgy.

Naked Bodies, Black clad Altars,
Bewitched macabre Lust.

Agios o Satanas!
Agios o Baphomet!
Agios o Satanas!
Agios o Baphomet!

Black Mass Oath, Desire the Greatness,
Of our Grand Black God.

Give Yourself and seal the Oath,
By the Power of our Prince.

As it has been, So it is and so shall it be again!
Celebrate the Rite of The Black Mass!

Whispers of ancients hearing our Call,
Master Lucifer.

Mistress' of Earth, Brides of Night,
Witches frenzied Orgy.

Naked Bodies, Black Clad Altars,
Bewitched macabre Lust.
