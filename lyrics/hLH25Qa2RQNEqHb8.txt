One of these days you'll break me of many things
Some cold white day
But you're crazy if you think I would leave you this way

You should wake up before the wrath comes
Me and you could take off before the wrath comes soon

And one of these days I pray it will be sometime soon
On a day like today
You'd be crazy not to want me to teach you the way

You should wake up before the wrath comes
Me and you could take off before the wrath comes soon

Well I know what you're like - I've read it on the walls
You're too tired
You choose heaven over the earth and me, but come on please

You should wake up before the wrath comes
Me and you could take off before the wrath comes
Well maybe you should take off
Yeah you should take off
