Inactivity all day
I'm wasting my brain away
Can't say what's on my mind
But I pick up but it all picked down
Feels like I'm everybody s gutter
The same that satisfies breaks others
Stress
Stress
Stress
Stress
Oh day, eat shit
I feels out or breath
Its always on my mind yet
I pick up but it all picks down
Feels like I'm everybody s gutter
The same that satisfies breaks others
Stress
Stress
Stress
Stress
Stress
Stress
Stress
