Wake up,
Wake up,
We're burning up,
Like embers in the breeze.

You're leaving your body
Right in front of me.

And even though we tried
To make it back on parts
That would never do, I didn't care
'Cause I have you. And if we don't
Survive, and all the pieces
Start to come unglued, I'm glad
I fell apart with you.

Why won't you let me in
Again? We've practiced this
A thousand times, just lift the latch
Let me inside. Oh why, won't you
Let me in? I know the sleepy feeling
Must be nice, but hear my voice,
Open your eyes.

Here we both collide,
Into the ocean that we both
Came from, the wall's on fire
But I feel numb. Underwater,
At least 100ft, and the surface
Looks like a sheet of ice,
Can you hear me scream?
I'm right outside.

Why won't you let me in
Again? We've practiced this
A thousand times, just lift the latch
Let me inside. Oh why, won't you
Let me in? I know the sleepy feeling
Must be nice, but hear my voice,
Open your eyes.

We are sinking down,
So low,
So low,
You are sleeping now,
Don't go,
Don't go,
We are sinking down,
So low,
Don't go.

I know that we can have
A future, but you have to hear
My call. It's time for us to go
Home, and leave these broken parts.

I know that you're weighed down
By water, but I have to get you out
It's time for us to go, no
I can never let you drown.

Why won't you let me in
Again? We've practiced this
A thousand times, just lift the latch
Let me inside. Oh, why won't you
Let me in? I know the sleepy feeling
Must be nice, but hear my voice,
Open your eyes.

(Wake up) I know that we can have
A future, but you have to hear
My call. (Wake up) It's time for us to go
Home, and leave these broken parts.

(Wake up) I know that you're weighed down
By water, but I have to get you out (Wake up)
It's time for us to go, no
I can never let you drown.
