Everyday I awake, I await my fate as the sky turns blue to grey
Now I understand it might be my last day
Might be my last day
Now I understand it might be my last day
Might be my last day

So what am I supposed to do now I've reached the end?
And if I gained another chance, would you still be there?

Please don't be lonely when I'm gone
I've been so sad for far too long
And as I gently slip away, this song will always stay

Please don't be lonely when I'm gone
I've been so sad for far too long
And as I gently slip away, this song will always stay

For now this is my goodbye
So what am I supposed to do now I've reached the end?
And if I gained another chance, would you still be there?

Please don't be lonely when I'm gone
I've been sad for far too long
And as I gently slip away, this song will always stay

Please don't be lonely when I'm gone
I've been sad for far too long
And as I gently slip away, this song will always stay
