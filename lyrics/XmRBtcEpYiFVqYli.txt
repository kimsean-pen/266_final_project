Pull the car to the side of the freeway
It all came clear in a flash
So I called to tell you I love you
Got so many questions to ask
Like where are we going?
What are we doing?
We said we would make memories, not dreams
Baby, it's now or never
So, go home and pack your things

'Cause I don't wanna go through the gates of heaven thinking what we might have missed
Don't wanna waste another day we're given, 'cause we're scared of taking risks
Let's see the eight world wonders, before we're six feet under, oh oh
Do everything we always talked about, mark them off the bucket list

Go to Rome, stand in awe
Climb a mountain in Nepal
Land in China, walk the wall
We gonna do it all
Dance in Rio in the sun
Head to Vegas for the fun
Do the things we never done, we never done
We never done, we never done, oh oh oh oh
We never done

So, go hand in your notice
We're leaving
Let's start doing the things that we love
Kill the dream now, but don't kill the dreamer
No, this town won't get the best of us
So, we're setting off
We're getting on a plane
We're going a little crazy, don't have to explain
We'll be laughing like kids on the playground
Taking hold of this life by the reigns

'Cause I don't wanna go through the gates of heaven thinking what we might have missed
Don't wanna waste another day we're given, 'cause we're scared of taking risks
Let's see the eight world wonders, before we're six feet under, oh oh
Do everything we always talked about, mark them off the bucket list, ey ey ey ey

Go to Rome, stand in awe
Climb a mountain in Nepal
Land in China, walk the wall
We gonna do it all
Dance in Rio in the sun
Head to Vegas for the fun
Do the things we never done, we never done
We never done, we never done, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We never done

'Cause I don't wanna go through the gates of heaven thinking what we might have missed
Don't wanna waste another day we're given because we're scared of taking risks
Let's see the eight world wonders
Before we're six feet under, oh oh
Do everything we always talked about
And mark them off your list, ey yeah

Go to Rome, stand in awe
Climb a mountain in Nepal
Land in China, walk the wall
We gonna do it all
Dance in Rio in the sun
Head to Vegas for fun
Do the things we never done, we never done
We never done, we never done, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We never done, we never done
