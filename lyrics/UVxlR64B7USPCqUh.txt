And don't I hold you like you want to be held?
And don't I treat you like you want?
And don't I love you like you want to be loved
And you're running away
What's your name
Like I'm in the way

And don't I hold you like you want to be held?
Don't I please you like you want?
And don't I love you like you want to be loved
And you're running away
What's your name
Like I'm in the way
We waste too much time

Don't I
Don't I
Don't I
Don't I hold you like you want?
