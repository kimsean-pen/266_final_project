Oh, I can't sleep
(I can't sleep)
Your love helps me breathe

Oh, I can't sleep
Your love helps me breathe
When I wake up
Want you next to me
Don't give a fuck
What people think

Ayy, ayy
Plug just hit my phone, he said the pack is on the way
Said I would stop smoking then I take one to the face
I'm a lonely stoner
But for her I made a change
I don't want somebody who gon' put me through the pain
When the rain stops pouring
Everything comes out
Girl, you're way too gorgeous to be stuck in the house
I would give you everything, fuck what he talkin' about
You know you not my number two
Girl, know you my boo, girl

Oh, I can't sleep
Your love helps me breathe
When I wake up
Want you next to me
Don't give a fuck
What people think

Ayy, ayy
Dropping ashes on my denim
She say she love me and she wish she never met him
Know this life is crazy but I hate when you play victim
Own up to your mistakes and all of your bad decisions
I know you get mad and try to blame it on me
You can't play it phony
I would never turn fake, that's extra salty
Now your life been sideways 'cause you lonely
Now it's on another page, another story, yeah

Oh, I can't sleep
Your love helps me breathe
When I wake up
Want you next to me
Don't give a fuck
What people think
