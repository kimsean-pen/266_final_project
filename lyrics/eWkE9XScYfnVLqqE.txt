in the car park
I find it hard not
to suffocate the feelings I've got
you're here with a friend that I like
he must be seeing you
to stand around in resignation
A decade from your confirmation

guess it's just a missed opportunity
to tell you all the things that you mean to me
I'm feeling selfish, feeling cruel,
like you know l do

it's sort of cold out
and we both doubt
that friends can be oblivious
to all the things they used to do to
one another
l don't think you've got the reasons
stay alarmed and keep me reeling

guess it's just a missed opportunity
to tell you all the things that you mean to me
I'm feeling selfish, feeling cruel,
like you know l do

one last call for sympathy
I know you've got the energy too
nine times out of seventy
you think its elementary, do you?
he seems like an alibi
impulsive sparks that magnify shame
I've gone and fought another fight
I don't think you've got the right to blame

guess It' s just a missed opportunity
to tell you all the things that you mean to me
I'm feeling selfish, feeling cruel,
like you know l do

guess It' s just a missed opportunity
to tell you all the things that you mean to me
I'm feeling selfish, feeling cruel,
like you know l do
