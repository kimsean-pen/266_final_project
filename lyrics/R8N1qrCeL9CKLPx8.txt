I heard the message
Then I rang it off the hook
I didn't get you 'til 1 am
Who was wrong and who was right?
And this distance caused a fight
Now I'm ready to give in

Honestly, I'd give anything
To be with you right now

This town is full of dumb reminders
"Having a good time" can't you tell?
Hang up the phone and then I come back down
Miss you, I hope you're doing well

I'm used to waiting
What's a voice without a face?
I think of dying, without you here
So I drink myself to sleep
And then I hide beneath a sheet
And I try to disappear

But I get up every single time
'Cause you keep me alive

This town is full of dumb reminders
How far I am from you in miles
If I could get what time has taken down
Maybe then I could see you...

This town is full of dumb reminders
"Having a good time" can't you tell?
Hang up the phone and then I come back down
Miss you, I hope you're doing
Miss you, I hope you're doing
Miss you, I hope you're doing well.
