With all the fire set in our eyes
without a cornerstone to realize
that later on we'll build the pyre
and burn so easily well everyone but me

and soon we'll sing in better moods
a sigularity well everyone but you
they'll pull the nerves out through the pores
though bruised so easily the comeback kid's not bleeding
with words that defied all our social gestures

no one could've known what the comeback kid did
no words could describe all the social pressures
that leads to the time when that comeback kid wins
and wins
and now we sing in better moods

together whispering well everyone but you
and later on we built that pyre
and burn so easily well everyone but me
everyone but me

everyone but me
everyone but me
and with words defied all our social gestures
no one could've known what that comeback kid did
no words could define all the social pressures
that leads to the time when that comeback kid wins...
and wins
and wins
and wins
and wins
and wins
