Peace of tide, my heart and my mind are shining through the light
We still surrender for this spark
Echoes wave but we shadow then, that's cause for
We still surrender for this spark

So baby tiger, so where I can come home
I walk around still on my dreaming hill, my dreaming hill, we're dreaming still

She can (?) but this one we taught dream to
While it apart from me
(?) which my heart wish to grow, to grow behind (?)
While it apart from me

So baby tiger, so where I can come home
I walk around still on my dreaming hill, my dreaming hill, we're dreaming still
