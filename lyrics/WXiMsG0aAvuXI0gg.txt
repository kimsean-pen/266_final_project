Oh, baby
What'cha gonna do, baby?
My, my, my love
Hey

I was a fool to let you in
Knowing you would play with my heart
But that was so long ago that I thought
We could make a new start

You left me broken hearted
From the day your love departed
Now that love you found
With someone new is gone
And so you wanna come back

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?
What'cha gonna do without my love?

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?
What'cha gonna do now that my love
Has gone away from you

Sweet memories of yesterday
When it all seemed so right
I was loving you, kissing you
Holding you tight

I wish you know that a woman
That you learn to leave today
And it's a shame that
You wanna come back now, baby
My love has gone away

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?
What'cha gonna do without my love?

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?
What'cha gonna do now that my love
Has gone away from you

I played the fool for you, baby
And you stole away my heart
Now that my love is gone away
Sweet memories of yesterday
Now that my love is gone away

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?
What'cha gonna do without my love?

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?
What'cha gonna do now that my love
Has gone away from you

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?
What'cha gonna do without my love?

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?
What'cha gonna do now that my love
Has gone away from you

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?
What'cha gonna do without my love?

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?
What'cha gonna do now that my love
Has gone away from you

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?
What'cha gonna do without my love?

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?
What'cha gonna do now that my love
Has gone away from you

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?
What'cha gonna do without my love?

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?
What'cha gonna do now that my love
Has gone away from you

What'cha gonna do without my love, my love?
