The only piece I still can grip with my hands are the pieces of the memories of your heart.
Not the same old songs anymore.
Waking eyes, I would die to see that again.
The only thing that still can fit in my heart are the pieces of the memories of your smile.
Not the same old songs anymore.
Your excuse, I could die to hear that again.
Waking the sheets in your bed, the smell of your hair,
It's all gone now for sure.
Why... you? all of those tapes has played out it's role now.
Just a single breeze of your life.
