Now we're standing here together
At the crystal borderline
All my memories are shattered
Nothing's left of what was mine
I'm tryin' to hold you
But you slip away
A candle cannot burn forever
To whom am I to pray

Up we rise into the night
We'll never die in the shadows
We can break out of these days
Darkness will blaze in the shadows
Our kingdom will come
When our dreams can grow wild
Up we rise into the night
We'll never die in the shadows

It's so hard to kill the demons
When they live inside your heart
Don't give up to find your fortune
When you don't know where to start
So come here and take me
I'm already gone
In a second life beside you
Is where I want to belong

Up we rise into the night
We'll never die in the shadows
We can break out of these days
Darkness will blaze in the shadows
Our kingdom will come
When our dreams can grow wild
Up we rise into the night
We'll never die in the shadows

Up we rise
Up we rise
In the shadows

Up we rise into the night
We'll never die in the shadows
We can break out of these days
Darkness will blaze in the shadows
Our kingdom will come
When our dreams can grow wild
Up we rise into the night
We'll never die in the shadows

In the shadows
