work expectations bind the holy to the wrong
reflecting what they'll never be
sing out, pay out another day has come and gone
get used to the feeling of rotting

just watch it, goat boy
you watch it, you're a goat

down in the rust steel yard a goat boy loses limb
no need to feed old nan and kids
old buck he pumps it up, to keep his life from getting low
then back to compo when he's home

just watch the goat boy
just watch it, you're a goat
let me hear the goat boy talk!
don't judge me, goat boy

you watch it, you're a goat
