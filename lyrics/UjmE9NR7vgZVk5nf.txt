Here I go again
With my head in my hands
When you say you'll call but you don't
And then I'll pretend
This is the last time
That I'll take you back when you say you're sorry

Don't leave me no more
Every time you walk out the door
I don't know if you're gonna come back around here anymore
Don't leave me no more
Every time you walk out the door
I don't know if you're gonna come back to me here anymore
Don't leave
Don't leave

I used to be a queen
But now I'm a shadow of me
I deserve more but love is a chore
And wanting you has made me so weak

Don't leave me no more
Every time you walk out the door
I don't know if you're gonna come back around here anymore
Don't leave me no more
Every time you walk out the door
I don't know if you're gonna come back to me here anymore
Don't leave
Don't leave

I'm such a fool for you
And you keep playing and playing around
Until the sun comes down and rises again in the morning
And my heart keeps breaking and breaking
And I'm tired of wasting and wasting away for a cure

Don't leave me no more
Every time you walk out the door
I don't know if you're gonna come back around here anymore
Don't leave me no more
Every time you walk out the door
I don't know if you're gonna come back to me here anymore
Don't leave
Don't leave

My heart keeps breaking and breaking and breaking down
You keep playing and playing and playing around
