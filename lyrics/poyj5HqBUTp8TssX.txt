Today is gonna be a good day
Don't care what anybody else say
Oh-oh-oh, I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me the way I'm feeling
Gonna be a good day
A good day

Choked up, just woke up
My girlfriend warned me that I drink too much
Advil, good pill
My head pounds like the bass on the party bus
Now, now graze, answer Instagram's telling me everything
I regret nothing, oh

Ooh-ooh-ooh, I feel like a million bucks in a toilet
Ooh-ooh-ooh, my head to my toes to my soul has been poisoned
Living proof that even when you're whole life has been destroyed
You still can enjoy it

Today is gonna be a good day
Don't care what anybody else say
Oh-oh-oh, I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me the way I'm feeling
Gonna be a good day
A good day

Good day
A good day
Good day
A good day

Last night, last night
Got in a fight with the karaoke mic
Shots fired, a fireball
Can't tell what's the ceiling or what's the wall

Ooh-ooh-ooh, I feel like a million bucks in a toilet
Ooh-ooh-ooh, my head to my toes to my soul has been poisoned
Living proof that even when you're whole life has been destroyed
You still can enjoy it

Today is gonna be a good day
Don't care what anybody else say
Oh-oh-oh, I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me the way I'm feeling
Gonna be a good day
A good day

Keep it going, I'll keep it going, I'll keep it going, ah-woo
Keep it going, I'll keep it going, I'll keep it going, ah-woo
When the morning comes, when the morning comes, when we're going, ah-woo
Keep it going, I'll keep it going, I'll keep it going, ah-woo

Today is gonna be a good day
Don't care what anybody else say, ahh...

Today is gonna be a good day
Don't care what anybody else say
Oh-oh-oh, I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me the way I'm feeling
Gonna be a good day
A good day
Gonna be a good day (Keep it going ah-woo)
Don't care what anybody else say (Keep it going ah-woo)
Oh-oh-oh, I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me the way I'm feeling
Gonna be a
Gonna be a good day (Keep it going ah-woo)
A good day

Good day
Good day
Good day
Good day
