Feel the beat at the drum
Move like you really wanna be number one
You could beat out the comp
Run like you really wanna be at the top
Stop, adrenaline by cause
You have been identified as a hustler
Topical discussion repeat it like a percussion
Chuck the douce up, and tell'em is just love

(Woop woop)
Damn diggedy dog
Let them bums stay mad cause we livin' it up
(Woop woop)
Shelve tops is on
And I pop it like I'm popping like I pop a sin call
And now, I don't wanna take you
If we fall down

Don't get upset

And now it's just the beginning
And we'll figure it out somehow
Right now, masquerade
Master the merry go round
Right now, masquerade
Master the merry go round
Right now, it's somethin' you create
It's never ever too late
It's never ever too late
Right now

Okay to make a mistake
Yeah baby this is your day

It's time to masqerade
Bass ba-bass
Feel the bass in ya face
Hit the finish line, first place in the race
Yes, King Kong on ya chest
Running and I'm coming up
Baton to your left
Yup, you could be who you want
Be who you is never be who you aren't
Never ever fold under pressure

Desperate times, ya desperate measure
(Woop woop)
Damn diggedy dog

Let them bums stay mad cause we livin' it up
(Woop woop)
Shelve tops is on
And I pop it like I'm popping, like I pop a sin call
And now, I don't wanna take you

If we fall down
Don't get upset
And now it's just the beginning
And we'll figure it out somehow

Right now, masquerade
Master the merry go round
Right now, masquerade

Right now, it's somethin' you create
