Blisters on my hands
And I feel the ... Fall
I got scissors in my head
Telling me to take a thought
Telling me to let it fail
Secret in the deep dark
Secret on the inside
Oooohhhhh I know
I'm home
Linger in myself

I rather always go alone
Linger there by the stairs
Oooohhhhh I know
I'm home
Oooohhhhh I know
I'm home
Secret in the deep dark
Secret on the inside
Oooohhhhh I know
I'm home
Keeps me awake now
Keeps me rested
Oooohhhhh I know
I'm home
Oooohhhhh I know
I'm home
Oooohhhhh I know
I'm home
