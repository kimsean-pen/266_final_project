I tried to stick myself through
Try to get to the other side
I had to patch up the cracks
And the holes that i had to hide

For a little bit of time even made it work, okay
Just long enough to really make it hurt
Then you figured me out
and it all just rotted away

Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
(Go on, get back to where you belong)

You better take a good look
'Cause I'm full of shit
With every bit of my heart
I have tried to believe in it

You can dress it all up
you can try to pretend
But you can't change anything
You can't change anything in the end

Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
(Go on, get back to where you belong)

Don't you fucking know what you are?

Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are

Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are

Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are

Don't you fucking know what you are?
(Go on, get back to where you belong)
Don't you fucking know what you are?
(Go on, get back to where you belong)

Don't you fucking know what you are?
(Go on, get back to where you belong)
Don't you fucking know what you are?
(Go on, get back to where you belong)
