I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
It's always best with the covers up
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
We know we're friends till we die

And either way you turn
Open up your skull
Climbing up the walls

And either way you turn
Open up your skull
Climbing up the walls

I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
