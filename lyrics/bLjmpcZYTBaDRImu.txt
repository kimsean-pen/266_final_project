Somehow I always knew
I'd bite the curb out spills the proof
The letter in your pocket now I can't escape the truth
Surprises so violent stop with the silence
Who is she to you

Tell me why tell me why my whole world's starting to shake
Cause ain't nobody ever tell you what it feels like when you're bout to break
I get nervous, tell me what's her name
I see a lot of missed calls and now I'm going off don't tell me it's ok
A storm is swallowing this interstate
When it rains it pours and the pain is coming in waves
Stay surfaced, love can't hold you down
So I will drive

Slow me down
I'm burning out of control so far from heaven now
Pull me back
Slow me down
It's like you've stolen my soul, so far from heaven now

I can't stand that streetlight I'm rolling out of bed
Again I belong to the night, I'm a mess
Pull me over, I can't forget her name
Or my urge to put this barrel to your face
This storm is swallowing my sanity
And all our memories are tainted with her cheap perfume
Eighteen years thrown away in a day
Somebody stop me now, before I get to you

Slow me down
I'm burning out of control so far from heaven now
Pull me back
Slow me down
It's like you've stolen my soul, so far from heaven now

My son, I gotta thank you for calling
Not sure who I would be if you stopped looking out for me

Somehow I always knew
Let me know when I need to
Slow you down, you're burning out of control
So far from heaven now

Slow me down
I'm burning out of control so far from heaven now
Pull me back
Slow me down
It's like you've stolen my soul, so far from heaven now

Slow me down
I'm burning out of control so far from heaven now
Pull me back
Slow me down
It's like you've stolen my soul, so far from heaven now
