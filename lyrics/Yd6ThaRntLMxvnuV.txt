No more
No more are the days that I will
Fear for I have found a strength that
None can match and I'll push forward
Never has the blood in my veins
Flowed so fiercely as when I feel this around me
I am whole

I'm not alone
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again
I'm not alone
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again

Now I feel the passion burning
This what drives me further strengthens
My resolve to push me further

And I believe
That I am not alone
I'm not alone

I'm not alone
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again
I'm not alone
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again

No more are the days that I will
Fear for I have found a strength that
None can match and I'll push forward
Now I feel the passion burning
This what drives me further strengthens
My resolve to push me further

I'm not alone (I'm not alone)
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again
I'm not alone (I'm not alone)
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again
(I am whole again, I am whole again)
