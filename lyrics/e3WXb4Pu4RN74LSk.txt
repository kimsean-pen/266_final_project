Awake and breathing, we halt and catch fire
Timing's never what the soul desires
I belong somewhere on the outside
Will the signal survive when the circuit breaks?

Telling me something, it's telling me something
It's telling me something now

What am I supposed to do?
You're dragging me away from the promised land
You fucked me up
But I refuse to let you kill what I am

Same old feeling when we halt and catch fire
Tired of all this reused desire
You belong somewhere, just not in my mind
I won't burn myself out, just to keep you warm

It's telling me something, it's telling me something
It's telling me something now
The pressure is rising, I feel it inside me
I need you to hear me now

What am I supposed to do?
You're dragging me away from the promised land
You fucked me up
But I refuse to let you kill what I am
What I am, what I am, what I am, am

What am I supposed to do?
You're dragging me away from the promised land
You fucked me up
But now I know who I am

What am I supposed to do?
You're dragging me away from the promised land
You fucked me up
But I refuse to let you kill what I am
What am I supposed to do?
You're dragging me away from the promised land
You fucked me up
But I refuse to let you kill what I am
What I am, what I am, what I am, am, am

What I am, what I am
