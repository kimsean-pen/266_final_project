Grey view coldly slithering
Indifferently floating
I can"t sleep
I feel half without you
And I sink
You were smoky
You were tragic
And I can"t sleep without you

Us lying in the bed
Your smile
Your laughter
Your fragrance
You showed me something
I thought I lost
But I"m lost with you
Your eyes
Feel like the big city
One glowing window
In the night
Two sad lovers
Lonely dancing
Lonely dancing
