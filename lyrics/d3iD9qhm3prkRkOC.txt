Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

Temperature is rising
High above the moon
At the speed I'm flying
I have to get there soon
I guess I'm losing contact
With tangible things
And now my head is blown-out
I've got to beat this thing.

Yeah, you're a child of the sun
All of your world is tumblin'
Down around your heels
You got to catch Mother Nature
Catch Mother Nature
Catch Mother Nature on the run, baby
Yeah, you're a child of the sun.

Flying through the air like Icarus
On the golden-feathered wings
Soaring high against the fire
Son, don't burn away.

Yeah, you're a child of the sun, baby
All of your world is tumblin'
Down around your heels
You got to catch Mother Nature
Catch Mother Nature
Catch Mother Nature on the run, baby
Yeah, you're a child of the sun.

Flying through the air like Icarus
On the golden-feathered wings
Soaring high against the fire
Son, don't burn away.
