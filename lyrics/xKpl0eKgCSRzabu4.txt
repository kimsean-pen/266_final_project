Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You just started doing the things you used to do

As I was motorvatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a coupe De Ville
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road
Nothin' outrun my V8 Ford
The Cadillac doin' about ninety-five
We was bumper to bumper, rollin' side by side

Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doing the things you used to do

The Cadillac pulled up to a hundred and four
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It done cloudy and started to rain
I tooted my horn for the passin' lane
The rain water blowin' all under my hood
I knew that was doin' my motor good

Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doing the things you used to do

Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doing the things you used to do

The motor cooled down, the heat went down
And that's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac sittin' like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten, a half a mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill

Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doing the things you used to do
