Dashing through paradise
So polite in what I say
Lost in the edge I'm in
I want a world to give away

I know what's mine
You'll learn what's yours
I know what you want to see
You scratch my back and I grow claws
Falling in love awkwardly

Dancing in my own good time
My words stick out of your face
If you're not feeling so weak today
Somebody will take your place

I know what's mine
You'll learn what's yours
I know what you want to see
You scratch my back, I grow claws
Falling in love awkwardly

Up, on

Dashing through paradise
So polite in what I say
Lost in the ache I'm in
I want a world to give away

Dancing in my own good time
My words stick out of your face
If you're not feeling weak today
Somebody will take your place
