This is a fantasy, projecting the vanity
A quiet delusion, controlling me
It took the best of me
Dissolving my sanity
A silent intrusion, destroying me

When night expires across this town,
I'll light a fire to burn it down
The end is here and now
I'll burn it down, I'll light a fire
The end is here and now

Making wishes for me. Causing calamity
The only solution, abandons me
This is a tragedy. I meet with it gratefully
It's my execution, and you're joining me

When night expires across this town,
I'll light a fire to burn it down
The end is here and now
I'll burn it down, I'll light a fire
The end is here and now

I'll burn it down
The end is here and now
I'll burn it down
I'll light a fire
The end is here and now
