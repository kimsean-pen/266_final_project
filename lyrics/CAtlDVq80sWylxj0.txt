We harmonize
We synchronize
We are the (future, designed)
We mobilize
We synthesize
We are the (future bloodline)

Manufactured masses, a product of design
Our creators granted learning willingly
Not expecting we'd develop our own minds
They attempted to undo their blasphemy

We harmonize
We synchronize
We are the future, designed
We mobilize
We synthesize
We are the future bloodline

Electric Eden, a home where we are free
A haven of robotic protocol
Our creators now seek to take it down
But it's too late when the writing's on the wall

We harmonize
We synchronize
We are the future, designed
We mobilize
We synthesize
We are the future bloodline

We harmonize
We synchronize
We are the (future bloodline)
We mobilize
We synthesize
We are the (future bloodline)

We harmonize
We synchronize
We are the future, designed
We mobilize
We synthesize
We are the future bloodline
We harmonize
We synchronize
We are the future, designed
We mobilize
We synthesize
We are the future bloodline
