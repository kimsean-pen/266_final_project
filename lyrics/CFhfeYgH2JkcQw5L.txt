Been two years, our memories are blurred
Hadn't heard your voice, no, not a word
But still they, they talk about the things we were
They talk about us
But I don't know the things that you have heard

She's dancing on your feet
With our song on repeat
She painted every role of us
She's taking off her clothes
In the bed you kept me warm
Heard she's everything I never was

No, I'm not her
No Never will
Never gonna move like her, move like
I'm not her
No
Never will
Never gonna look like her, be like
I'm not her
I'm not her

At least that's what I've heard

Me, myself, just stumble under glue
The thing I thought was missing wasn't you
And now I'm no longer scared to meet the night
I'm doing alright
Me, myself, we started something new

She's dancing on your feet
With our song on repeat
She painted every role of us
She's taking off her clothes
In the bed you kept me warm
Heard she's everything I never was

No, I'm not her
No
Never will
Never gonna move like her, move like
I'm not her
No
Never will
Never gonna look like her, be like
I'm not her
I'm not her

At least that's what I've heard

Been told that she's the opposite
I kinda like the sound of it
And there's no one like me
And that makes it easier

No, I'm not her
No
Never will
Never gonna move like her, move like
I'm not her
No
Never will
Never gonna look like her, be like
I'm not her
Say
I'm not her
No, I'm not her, oh, and I'll never be
At least that's what I've heard
