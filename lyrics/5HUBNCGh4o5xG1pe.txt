I kissed your mouth and forgot what it sounded like
Hounds in the wasted light
Stumbling out into the dark (into the dark)
I know it's hard when you think you're the only target
The mind's a funny fruit to sell at the market (the market)
I'm running home with my heels on my head
And everything, every-everything that you said
Lights shine brighter when there's tears in your eyes
I guess that's a nice surprise
Late at night when you'd tuck me into bed
You'd hold a knife over my head
Until my mindless heart bleed
And say sweet dreams (sweet dreams)
I know it's hard when you think you're the only target
The mind's a funny fruit to sell at the market (the market)
I'm running home with my heels on my head
And everything, every-everything that you said
Lights shine brighter when there's tears in your eyes
I guess that's a nice surprise
You don't know
You don't know me anymore
I changed my hair!
I changed my hair!
I changed my hair!
You don't know
You don't know me anymore
I changed my hair!
I changed my hair!
I changed my---

I'm running home with my heels on my head
And everything, every-everything that you said
Lights shine brighter when there's tears in your eyes
I guess that's a nice surprise
I'm running home with my heels on my head
And everything, every-everything that you said
Lights shine brighter when there's tears in your eyes
I guess that's a nice surprise
I'm running home with my heels on my head
And everything, every-everything that you said
Lights shine brighter when there's tears in your eyes
I guess that's a nice surprise
