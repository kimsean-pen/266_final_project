Wow, tell me what you think you're lookin' at
No, so I think I'm Queen Elizabeth
No, and now I'm stuck inside your memory
So, that's why it's so hard to get rid of me

I'm incredible, so unforgettable
So no one can take my place
I'm unbreakable, highly flammable
So girl, get out my face

Oh my God, I'm going crazy
Maybe 'cause we're so amazing
An' everybody in there dazin'
That's the reason why they're hatin'

Treat us like some superstars
And only 'cause that's what we are
You know we're going really far
And y'all ain't even heard it all

You hate 'cause I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
A pretty little problem
You hate 'cause I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
A pretty little problem

You hate me 'cause I'm everything that you ever wanted to be
And that I'm lying 'cause I love it when you lookin' at me
'Cause I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
I said that I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
Keep lookin' at me

Wow, it seems to me like I was botherin'
How? 'Cause I'm a walkin' look like modelin'
How? It ain't my fault the boys keep followin'
Wow, if you were better he wouldn't be wonderin'

I'm incredible, so unforgettable
So no one can take my place
I'm unbreakable, highly flammable
So girl, get out my face

Oh my God, I'm going crazy
Maybe 'cause we're so amazing
An' everybody in there dazin'
That's the reason why they're hatin'

Treat us like some superstars
And only 'cause that's what we are
You know we're going really far
And y'all ain't even heard it all

You hate 'cause I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
A pretty little problem
You hate 'cause I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
A pretty little problem

You hate me 'cause I'm everything that you ever wanted to be
And that I'm lying 'cause I love it when you lookin' at me
'Cause I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
I said that I'm a rockstar, a rockstar

We're Prima J, you know it
We're not afraid to show it
We hold our crown and that's right
It can't stop us now

The cloud we're on is golden
They can't fix what's not broken
Don't act like y'all don't know
What's 'bout to happen now

You hate 'cause I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
A pretty little problem
You hate 'cause I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
A pretty little problem

You hate me 'cause I'm everything that you ever wanted to be
And that I'm lying 'cause I love it when you lookin' at me
'Cause I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
I said that I'm a rockstar, a rockstar

You hate 'cause I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
A pretty little problem
You hate 'cause I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
A pretty little problem

You hate me 'cause I'm everything that you ever wanted to be
And that I'm lying 'cause I love it when you lookin' at me
'Cause I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
I said that I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
