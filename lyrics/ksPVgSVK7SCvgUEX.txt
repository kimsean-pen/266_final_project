While you are young let your poor heart break
It's a beautiful morning to throw away
While you are young let your judgement sway
There are things you'll get wrong, everyone does the same
The trouble you made and all your mistakes
If it makes your life hard, you change
Let your hours go to waste
Let your night turn to day
It's too late to go home so just stay
I hope we'll all be old someday
Time is gonna come when the nights grow long
And you won't know what's missing, but you'll know that it's gone
While you are young let your poor heart break
It's a beautiful morning don't throw it away
The trouble you made
And all your mistakes
If it makes your life hard, you change
Let your hours go to waste
Let your night turn to day
It's too late to go home so just stay
I hope we'll all be old someday
Trouble you made
And all your mistakes
If it makes your life hard you change
Let your hours go to waste
Let your night turn to day
It's too late to go home so just stay
I hope we'll all be old someday
