Uh, grew up on making fucking robo noise
I came, I destroy, aye
Sold out shows 'round the globe twice
know I feel like a fucking viceroy, aye (I do)
Never say die, I do whatever drug, I always enter the void
But this time when I die make sure I'm buried in FTP corduroy
$uicideboy$
Most avoided, most ignored
I like the rolls down from before (I do)
Who am I, Freud?
I'm not who I thought I was anymore

I'm not, like you
I'm not, like you
I don't want the life you live (I'm not)
I don't want no wife and kids (like you)
I don't want to die in this (I'm not)
All the things they said around me (like you)
I don't want the life you live (I'm not)
I don't want no fucking kids (like you)
I don't want to die in hell (I'm not)
All the things they said around me (like you)
I don't want the life you live (I'm not)
I don't want no fucking kids (like you)
I don't want to die in this (I'm not)
All the things they said around me (like you)

Ask me if I'm happy, stupid motherfucking question (hold up)
No pity needed finding women; I was seven
Was sad then
Running drugs up on my bike
You know I had a weapon
And then drugs became my obsession
Nobody can say they gave me a fucking thing

Got in front of money, I'm a G-O-D, hold up
Born south side west, banging living legend
Revive your Christ, this your fucking day, right
Northside Shawty off the porch
Sippin' dip, let's see
Wanna quit, life overrated as shit
Everyday eating sticks, gotta wash it down
And when I wash it down, you know where this with (bitch)

I just want some happiness
To live a normal life again (ah)
Slip right into nothing
Talk with my cousin, like he actually my cousin (I said)
I just want some happiness
To live a normal life again (ah)
Sleep late and do nothing
Talk to my cousin, like he actually my cousin
