Rose after rose of passenger place
Headed out again, running all in vain
Motel blues, only bad news
I'm never looking for you
You'll find me all the same

I lay awake at night envisioning
A trace from the past
This heavy heart of mine, it never fails
To bring me right back

Now I see us walking down Cedar Lane
Slowing, the sunshine passed in the rain
Tremble so swiftly all of those days
I still remember how you used to say
Something good will come out of this

Coast after coast, cities and states
My world's an empty map where nothing remains
The place we belong is quietly gone
While we were making plans, it drifted away

I lay awake at night envisioning
A trace from the past
This heavy heart of mine, it never fails
To bring me right back

Now I see us walking down Cedar Lane
Slowing, the sunshine passed in the rain
Tremble so swiftly all of those days
I still remember how you used to say
Something good will come out of this

Something good will come out of this

How could I break away from you?
How could I break away from you?
How could I break away from you?
How could I break away from you?
How could I break away from you?
How could I break away from you?
How could I break away from you?
How could I break away from you?
