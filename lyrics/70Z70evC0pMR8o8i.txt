he was just a dog
now his bodies gone
so what is left but me and my poem?

i am just a normal girl
but my name is frank
i just wanna get taken
on a date

all the crazies on the bus
love me so much
i laugh at all the lights
and feel a little right

what is coffee and what is wine?
i dont mind if you don't mind

honey you're always so sad
cats out of the bag
i'm sad too

dad made the appointment
to kill my best friend
there goes my fear of death

i just want my dog back
is that so much to ask?
"i wish that
i could kiss his paws"
