Talking away
I don't know what
What to say
I'll say it anyway
Today is another day to find you
Shying away
Oh, I'll be coming for your love, okay?

Take On Me (Take On Me)
Take me on (Take On Me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be
Stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
Oh, it's no better to be safe than sorry

Take On Me (Take On Me)
Take me on (Take On Me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh, the things that you say
Is it life or just to play
My worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take On Me (Take On Me)
Take me on (Take On Me)
I'll be gone
In a day
Take On Me (Take On Me)
Take me on (Take On Me)
I'll be gone (Take On Me)
In a day (Take me on, Take On Me)
Take On Me (Take On Me)
Take me on (Take On Me)
