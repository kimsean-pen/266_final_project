I'm not able to feel
Am I decayed?
Am I withered?
I'm not able to run
Like a footless ego, a helpless hero
So I'm not able to fix myself
I need you, my dear
I need your help
Oh no!
I was never there for you
I was never there for you
So I've tried to be selfless and all I got was heartless
I don't wanna be cold
Don't wanna lose my soul
I'm not able to talk 'bout all my
goddamn problems; but it's more than this
I don't know how to find a way out
I need you right now but I feel like I'm a fraud 'cause
I was never there for you
I was never there for you
So I've tried to be selfless and all I got was heartless
I don't wanna be cold
Don't wanna lose my soul
Don't wanna lose my soul
I don't wanna be cold
So I've tried to be selfless and all I got was heartless
I don't wanna be cold
Don't wanna lose my soul
