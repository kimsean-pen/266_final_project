There is an unpleasant sensation
Which comes about when one has
Stayed in the same place for too long
It is something like that revulsion we feel
When a coalition of tiny red spiders
Settles at the back of our throat
All they want is a nice place to inhabit
So we ignore them for a time
Even though their presence is intolerable
At some point, after many generations
Have lived and died back there
The stupidity of our inaction becomes apparent
How idiotic it was to let them stay
And for so long at that
Then at the meridian of our disgust
That fecund clot is ejected and
The resulting emptiness begets a dull ache
A listlessness which blooms in their absence
