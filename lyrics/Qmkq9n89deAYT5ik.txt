I wanna say it like Simon would
'Cause I was listening this morning
On my own thinking if I could
I'd be Kathy and make this bus a greyhound
And this sun would always stay down
And there would be so much time for us
Time for us

My hand's out, I wanna throw my cards now
Making your name our hometown
But all my trains are here
Please don't be worried
No doubt I'll found you in our old crowd
So many things to say if you stay

So stay young
I know that I'm talking too much
And I'll get nowhere tryna do it at once
But oh my God, I wanna be someone
So stay young
With me, 'cause I hope that it's you
That I'll break my back tryna run home to
Because oh my God, I want you to be the one
So stay young

I wanna say it like Simon would
I wanna make my mother feel things
I wanna have the marching band
But right now it's just me
And steel strings, lonely (stay young)
So when I miss you it is slowly
'Cause I'm doing good here mostly on my own
Mostly on my own (stay young)

My hand's out, I wanna throw my cards now
Making your name our hometown
But all my trains are here
Please don't be worried (stay young)
No doubt, I'll found you in our old crowd
So many things to say if you stay

So stay young (stay young)
I know that I'm talking too much
And I'll get nowhere tryna do it at once
But, oh my God, I wanna be someone
So stay young (stay young)
With me, 'cause I hope that it's you
That I'll break my back tryna run home to
Because, oh my God
I want you to be the one
So stay young (stay young)

Oh, stay young (stay young)
(Stay young)

And I promise I care
I know it's hard, know that I'm never there
But call me from the bathroom when you're low
We'll stay young, until we wanna be old
Electric blankets so we're never cold
'Cause you have always been my ticket home
And we stayed young

So stay young (stay young)
I know that I'm talking too much
And I'll get nowhere tryna do it at once (stay young)
But oh my God
I wanna be someone (Be someone)
So stay young (stay young)
With me, 'cause I hope that it's you
That I'll break my back tryna run home to
Because, oh my God
I want you to be the one, the one
So stay young (stay young)

Oh, stay young
Oh, stay young
(Stay young)
Just stay young (stay young)
