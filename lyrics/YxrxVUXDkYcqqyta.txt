Don't you come back now
Don't shoot in your eyes
And if you dance your look
I'll be you waiting.

Impera belisimo
Impera samie vero
To dedi ioshoine gora

You'll hear my prayer
Don't shoot in your eyes
And if you dance to the moon
I'll be you waiting.

Impera belisimo
Impera samie vero
To dedi ioshoine gora

Emani diavole
Emore diavole
Eniere mani
Diavole

Impera belisimo
Impera samie vero
To dedi ioshoine divo

Don't you come back now
Don't shoot in your eyes
You'll hear my prayer
I'll be you waiting...
