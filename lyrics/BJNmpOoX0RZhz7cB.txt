Hey little sister what have you done?
Hey little sister who's the only one?
Hey little sister who's your Superman?
Hey little sister who's the one you want?
Hey little sister shot gun!

It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a White Wedding
It's a nice day to start again

It's a nice day to start again
Come on yeah It's a nice day for a White Wedding
It's a nice day to start again! Oww!

(guitar solo)

Pick it up!
Take me back home yeah!

Hey little sister what have you done?
Hey little sister who's the only one?
You see, I've been away for so long (So long)
I've been away for so long (So long)
I've let you go for so long

It's a nice day to start again
Come on, It's a nice day for a White Wedding
It's a nice day to start again! Oww!

There ain't nothing fair in this world
There ain't nothing safe in this world
And there ain't nothing sure in this world
And there ain't nothing pure in this world
If there's something left in this world

Start again (how, how)
It's a nice day for a White Wedding
Whoo! It's a nice day to start again (repeat till fade)
