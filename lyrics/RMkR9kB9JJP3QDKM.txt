Sticking around
It makes me feel right
Kicking it down
I taste the other side
Sick of the ground
It's hell for the last time
All over now
Cause it makes me feel alright

Changing my way
Not sick for the first time
I think I'll stay
Cause it makes me feel fine

You remind me when I was young
You remind me when I was young
You remind me when I was young
