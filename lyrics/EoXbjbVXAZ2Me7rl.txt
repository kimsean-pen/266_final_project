My weakness is I can't say no.
My weakness is I can't let go.
So stay with me I'll let you know
that love is something I can show.

I heard it's not bad to do without,
...it's in my mind, I'll work it out.
I tried and tried and got nowhere.
But still I know what it's all about.

My weakness is I can't say no.
My weakness is I can't let go.
So stay with me I'll let you know
that love is something I can show.
