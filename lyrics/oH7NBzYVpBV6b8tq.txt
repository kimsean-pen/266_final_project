The grass was as green
As it always was
That sinister day
The blackbird sang their songs
As they always did
That black-letter day

We passed the great gate
For the very last time
I did not look back
I knew we'd stay

I knew they would not let us go
Leave the death strip
I saw the gleam in their eyes
Of fear and enslavement
The crushing weight

Beloveth ground
Take me home

Alesia, Alisanos
Wake me when I'm gone
Ianotouta, eternity
Proclaim our barren sacrifice

On that ground we cherished life
We embraced death
As the children's cries trailed off
Sob yielded deathly (hush)

Alesia, Alisanos
Wake me when I'm gone
Ianotouta, eternity
Proclaim our barren sacrifice

Ooh

The grass was as green
As it always was
That sinister day
As we walked the alleys
Like thousand times before
I knew we'd stay
Alesia, Alisanos
Wake me when I'm gone
Ianotouta, eternity
Proclaim our barren sacrifice
(Outside Alesia)
(We offered a living sacrifice)
(Outside the doors of Alesia)
(Where our tears run dry)
