Microphone check, one, two
Microphone check, one, two
Three to the five, without the four
One of the homies decided to stay offshore
Hardcore dancefloor version,
I don't forget my mission, strong competition
Passion is passion, time is for reaction
Deal with that and be ready for the aftermath
I Repeat: every time we will fall, we'll get back on our feet
This is...

The Legacy of Shi

It will not be like before
Birth of the lord, rise of the north
Four Horsemen on my laser player
Shonen Rage, built me harder
Support system, out of the picture
Japan filled the gap, don't surrender
You're on the sidelines when we fight on the frontlines
Blood, sweat, no tears
Taken risks to make a dime
This is...

The Legacy of Shi

Tall buildings in sight
But something doesn't seem right...
The stars disappear
The storm comes near...
Dark soul revealed, the masterlord reigns
His sword brings pain
His sword brings pain
Dark pen revealed, the masterlord reigns
His word breaks the game
His word breaks the game
His sword brings pain
His word breaks the game
This is...

The Legacy of Shi
