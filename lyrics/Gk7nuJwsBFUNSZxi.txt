Oh child, it's up to you
'Cause I tried to tell the truth
But the world got in the way
Now it's much too late

We'll swim in the lake
At night we'll do it again
'Cause these words I tried to say
They got in the way

'Cause oh, your heart is bigger than they say
Bigger than they say, for sure
No your heart will never entertain
Never entertain their minds

Oh child, it's down to you
The cold nights, the cage of youth
All the heartache, the heartache and the fruit
Is it out for you?

'Cause oh, your heart is bigger than they say
Bigger than they say, for sure
No your heart will never entertain
Never entertain their minds

'Cause oh, your heart is bigger than they say
Bigger than they say, for sure
No your heart will never entertain
Never entertain their minds

'Cause oh, your heart is bigger than they say
Bigger than they say, for sure
No your heart will never entertain
Never entertain their minds
