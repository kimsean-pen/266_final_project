sing to the mystery of his blood
sing to the mystery of his blood
his blood
his blood
his blood
sing to the mystery of his blood

to die and lies on the day of days
believe in all, believe in none
till kingdom come, may his kingdom come
mercy's r[...?] will be undone

sing to the mystery of his blood
sing to the mystery of his blood
his blood
his blood
his blood
sing to the mystery of his blood
