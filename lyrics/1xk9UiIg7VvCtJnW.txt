Dear Daddy, I'm coming home!
I know you don't remember me
But I used to be your doll
I used to be your princess
Your heart and your soul
I used to be your angel
But, always alone
In an empty house
Of stolen dreams
And broken hearts

I'm done, I'm done drowning in tears of sorrow
I'm done, I'm done drowning in tears of sorrow
Sorrow

Cause I can fly with no wings
Shine in the night with an eternal fire
The art inside me is unleashed
I'm naked now, in obscene colors.
Cause I can fly with no wings
Shine in the night with an eternal fire
The art inside me is unleashed
I'm naked now, in obscene colors.

Dear Mom, I'm coming home!
I hope you are proud of me
I am not alone anymore
I found a reason to live
A reason to breathe
I found a place in this world
For my orphan soul
For my orphan soul
My empty house
Of stolen dreams
And broken hearts

Cause I can fly with no wings
Shine in the night with an eternal fire
The art inside me is unleashed
I'm naked now, in obscene colors.
Cause I can fly with no wings
Shine in the night with an eternal fire
The art inside me is unleashed
I'm naked now, in obscene colors.

I'm done, I'm done drowning in tears of sorrow
Suffocating in the endless hollow, suffocating!
Burning in the freezing, scary silence
Getting tired and old while waiting for something.
Waiting for something.
Waiting for something.
Waiting for something.
