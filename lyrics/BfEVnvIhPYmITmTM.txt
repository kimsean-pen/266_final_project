Open my eyes and see my bleeding wounded hands
Feeling the pain too hard to stand, to stand
Caught in the now and here while they are on the way
Hiding imagination, leading us astray

Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind
Sanity can be the toll
Leading to the core of your soul

We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams
Gnosis and life, Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams
Gnosis and life, Avantasia!
Avantasia

Walking along the icy gallery of pain
Tell me now, what can keep the flame alive?
Lack of imagination, raising up the tower
Where they hold our souls to take away the tower

Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind
Sanity can be the toll
Leading to the core of your soul

We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams
Gnosis and life, Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams
Gnosis and life, Avantasia!
