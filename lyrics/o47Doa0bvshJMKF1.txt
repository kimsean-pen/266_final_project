Want to, but I can't help it, I love the way it feels
This got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday, knowing that I won't
I got a problem, and I (don't know what to do about it)
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit, but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it

And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move, but I like it

And it's all because of you (All because of you)
And it's all because of you (All because of you)
And it's all because of you (All because of you)
And it's all because
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

Think of it every second, I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time I'm gon' get me some
Know I should stay away from, 'cause it's no good for me
I try and try, but my obsession won't let me leave
I got a problem, and I (don't know what to do about it)
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit, but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it, hey

And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you (strung out on you)
I can barely move, but I like it (but I like it)

And it's all because of you (Oh, all because of you)
And it's all because of you (Oh, all because of you)
And it's all because of you (all because of you)
And it's all because
Never get enough (never get enough)
She's the sweetest drug

Ain't no doubt (No doubt, hey)
So strung out (Strung out, hey)
Ain't no doubt (There's ain't no grain of doubt, oh)
So strung out (hey)
Over you
Over you (you)
Over you (you)

Because of you
And it's all because of you
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug
She's the sweetest drug
