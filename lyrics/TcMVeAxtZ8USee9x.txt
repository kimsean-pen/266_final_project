Hail Lucifer!
Dark bringer of light
Hail Lucifer!
Giver of eternal sight

Wisdom bringer - We call upon thy name
Bestow upon us thy infernal blessings
Of the inner divine flame

Open our eyes Mighty Father
So that we may see
Guide our steps on the Burning Path
Of liberation and ecstasy

Titanic Prometheus - God of forbidden light
Your Black Flame we bear inside as a legacy of your might

Illumination's father - God of shadowless light
Black Sun of dark mysteries - Restore the dragon's sight

Mighty god of darkness
All salutations to thee
Your gift of knowledge and rebellion
Will set our spirits free

Lylusay Tateros Volt Sids Lucifer!
Lylusay Tateros Volt Sids Lucifer!

Open our eyes Mighty Father
So that we may see
Guide our steps on the Burning Path
Of liberation and ecstasy

Mighty god of darkness
All salutations to thee
Raise the hidden flames within us
Into chaos set us free
