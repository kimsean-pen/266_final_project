You'll come alive in one more minute
No chance you won't forget it yeah
Losing all control
No place left to go
And your words of glory
Talk tuff in lies and stories yeah
Alone here on the road
Destined to explode
You'll come alive when there's no more running yeah
Never die you just keep on coming

Sun rise
No lies
You'll come alive when there's no more running yeah
You never die
You never die

In the next life you can all remember
Any child can last forever yeah
A lesson from the road
Even though I lost control
I did it all for honour
But i can ride no longer yeah
When I've been here for too long
Will i miss you when I'm gone

You'll come alive when there's no more running yeah
Never die you just keep on coming

Sun rise
No lies
You'll come alive when there's no more running yeah
You never die
You never die
