Time is wasting, time is a-wasting
Time is wasting, time is a-wasting
Time is wasting, time is a-wasting

Not much time left
No, not much time left
Not much time left
No, not much time left

Not much time left
Not that much time left
Not much time left
Not that much time left

Time is wasting, time is a-wasting
Time is wasting, time is a-wasting
Time is wasting, time is a-wasting

Yes
We're gonna get old
We will die
We're gonna get old together
Just you and me
Wait and see

Time is wasting, time is a-wasting
