Please allow me to try and explain
I'm living proof that man can change
I knew what I wanted
I knew how to get it
It didn't make me happy
so I started again
What I wanted to be was
a family man
but nature had some
alternative plans
So I did without the lot
put emotion on hold
and hoped my instincts
would do what they were told

I wanna know, yeah
I wanna know

But every now and then
often at night
a particular feeling would surface in spite
of what I'd told myself
and tried to deny
I kept on asking the question: why?

Why? Why? Why?
I wanna know

You grow up and experience this
a total metamorphosis
It's all about change
It's a metamorphosis

With time and age
I had to change
'cause my behaviour
was getting strange
People on the street
caught my eye
and I began to think
I might be their kind of guy
The long-term suppression
of an adolescent urge
was in retreat
and I was on the verge
of falling in love
or having fun
Time was running out
Something had to be done

I wanna know, yeah
I wanna know

Where was I?
Laying down the law
dancing with the others
out on the floor
Music and smoke
What did it mean?
Somebody spoke
and I went into a dream
I had what I wanted
Madly in love
Nothing else mattered
This was enough
Questions were answered
which used to perplex
in particular those about
the big s.e.x.

I wanna know, yeah
I wanna know
I wanna know, yeah
Tell me what's the reason
Tell me what's the reason

You grow up and experience this
a total metamorphosis
It's all about love
It's a metamorphosis

Dreaming is easy, life is tough
I got the picture
The most important thing
is not to end up bitter
'cause when you start to feel
increasingly forlorner
- woomph! - love comes
right around the corner
It may not last
but here am I
once a caterpillar
now a butterfly
It can seem strange
but when you reminisce
It's all about change
It's a metamorphosis

It's all about love
It's a metamorphosis
