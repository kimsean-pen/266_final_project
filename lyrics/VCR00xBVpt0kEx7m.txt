I've had a drink and ate some stuff
Now I'm already bored
A couple of bros said some shit I'm choosing to ignore

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I want to complain

I just fall on my face when I'm trying to have fun
Do you ever dream about what it's like to give up

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I want to complain

I want to feel like nothing's wrong
Go to bed, sleep this off
I want to feel like nothing's wrong
Sleep it off, sleep it off, sleep it off

I should quit my job and get a life
Fuck Friday nights
But I want to be in the scene and there's comfort in routine

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I want to complain
