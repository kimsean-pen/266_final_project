(Anderson)

In me you'll see
Dirt flows freely
But you may find
That my thoughts are unkind

Pure life needs knife
Cuts off my life
But as you see
Hurting you you bless me

I always wanted to cry
After the act close my eyes
I always longed for the deep
Then I just wanted to sleep

Blood stream cruel dream
Never make clean

Down by my side I feel safe when I hide
So you can see that my thought are for me
