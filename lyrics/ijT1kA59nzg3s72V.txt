We shed
Love then grew
Grew apart but I never knew
The harm that you were doing
To me all along
Our love's not red, it's nothing

Give up and start from now
Nothing can hurt or haunt me now
I am reborn
(Find another name for me, find another name for me)
I am reborn
(Find another name for me, find another name for me)

These are new beginnings
Won't let the past determine
Where I go from here
My ghosts have turned to nothing

Give up and start from now
Nothing can hurt or haunt me now
I am reborn
(Find another name for me, find another name for me)
I am reborn
(Find another name for me, find another name for me)
