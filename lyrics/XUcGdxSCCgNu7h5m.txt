You could be a lawyer, you could be a doctor
You could get the dinner with the extra pound of lobster
You could make the music, you could be a painter
You're a precious snowflake with your picture in the paper

The little lies you're told, it seems like they don't love you anymore
Yeah, they're right outside your door, it's come to an end
(Don't tell me that, don't tell me that)

You could be an athlete, you could drive a sports car
You deserve the things you want, just put 'em on your points card
You could be important, you could make a difference
You deserve the finer things, you're supposed to be famous

The little lies you're told, it seems like they don't love you anymore
Yeah, they're right outside your door, it's come to an end
(Don't tell me that, don't tell me that, don't tell me that, just keep 'em away)
The little lies you're told
(They're creepin' up)
It seems like they don't love you anymore
(They're creepin' up)
Yeah, they're right outside your door
(They're creepin' up)
It's come to an end
(Don't tell me that, don't tell me that, don't tell me that, don't tell me that)

Those are lies that they told you, they don't pay the rent
Those are lies that they told you, they don't pay the rent
Those are lies that they told you, they don't pay the rent
Those are lies that they told you, they don't pay the rent

The little lies you're told, it seems like they don't love you anymore
Yeah, they're right outside your door, it's come to an end
(Don't tell me that, don't tell me that, don't tell me that, just keep 'em away)
The little lies you're told
(They're creepin' up)
It seems like they don't love you anymore
(They're creepin' up)
Yeah, they're right outside your door
(They're creepin' up)
It's come to an end
(Don't tell me that, don't tell me that, don't tell me that, don't tell me that)
