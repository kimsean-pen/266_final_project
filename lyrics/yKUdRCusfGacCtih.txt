Conductor stood up and took role call,
He sent love and happiness into the next car.
"Are you in today?"
The bags are in and we plan no stops,
Just fearing sleeping in the box.
"Are you in today?"

Who built the love?
Who built the love?
Who built the love, love, love?
Who built the love, love, love?
Who built the love, love, love?
Who built the love, love, love?

Mayor stood up in high demand,
He spoke in trash cars and garbage rails.
"Are you in today?"
Found the feet, won't lift the feed,
Slipped to the shoes just before the bed.
Beds are empty as the throats and banks
That rise free of the cries and crimes that cry:
"Are you in today?"

"Will there be a better place?"
Who built the love?
Who built the love?
Who built the love, love, love?
Who built the love, love, love?
Who built the love, love, love?
Who built the love, love, love?

Teacher stood up and took role call,
Sent the boots, the coats, the caps, the colors.
"Are you in today?"
Slip into the water,
Slip into them jewelry cuts.
Slip into the mind,
The coats, the caps, the colors
And the banks that jail the problems that go.
"Are you in today?"

"Will there be a better place?"
Who built the love?
Who built the love?
Who built the love, love, love?
Who built the love, love, love?
Who built the love, love, love?
Who built the love, love, love?

I found gold, gold got it, got it?
I found gold, gold got it, got it?
I found gold, gold got it, got it?
I found gold, gold got it, got it?
I found gold, gold got it, got it?
I found gold, gold got it, got it?

Pears and peaches and Doctor Hippo
Met for a drink in those marshmallow clouds,
Shout at the pavement that's sprouting up turnips
Who are shouting right back,
"We don't need your lectures,
We'll al live on.
Live on, on, on.
Live on."
