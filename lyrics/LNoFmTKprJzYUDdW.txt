There is nothing boy that can stop my course
I will hold you tight never let you go
Tomorrow's party will never end
Like a bud in spring our love will
Bloom and grow

Your eyes to me are precious stones
On a face that's made of a solid gold
When I hold your hand I want to cry
And your loving arms to protect me
From the cold you are my world

The soul inside now belongs to you
I'm drowing in a love so deep
We will overcome those ups and downs
So happiness is forever ours to keep

I will follow you to the end of time
I will be the blood flowing through your veins
I will ride with you till the end of the line
You will be my everythingmy world
You are you are you are you are
Oh boy you are my world
