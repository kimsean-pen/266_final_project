I am my father's son, I am my father's mistakes
I'm easily undone, and I'm no stranger to rage
I am no stranger to rage
I am no stranger to rage

I built the bars out of bottles, drowned myself just to escape
I am my father's son, I am my father's mistakes
And I'm ashamed of myself, I just want out of this place
This fucking hell I created, I can't seem to escape
I had to learn for myself, the fastest way to my death
So I could follow his footsteps to my hospital bed

All my life I have been trying to understand myself
It seems like my own reflection is just somebody else
It's taken years to know my father courses through my veins
And though I never knew him, it turns out we're the same

I am no stranger to rage

I am my father's son, won't be my father's mistakes
I've crept through shadows and alleys, found my home on the streets
I've felt the cold glare of strangers as they passed over me
I never figured I'd turn out to be such a disgrace
But I'm my father's son, the sum of all his mistakes
I had to learn from myself, the fastest way to my death
So I could follow his footsteps to my hospital bed

All my life I have been trying to understand myself
It seems like my own reflection is just somebody else
It's taken years to know my father courses through my veins
And though I never knew him, it turns out we're the same

I am no stranger to rage

And though I never knew him, though I never knew him, it turns out we're the same
And though I never knew him, though I never knew him, it turns out we're the same
I am my father's son, I am my father's son
I am my father's son, won't be my father's mistakes
I am my father's son, I am my father's son
I am my father's son, I am my father's son
