Waking up to the breath of the ore, in the sea of Black
If you cut a worm in two the other half will grow back
If I'm alive or dead I don't really care as long as my Soul's intact
Buried alive

Stinking corpse, I smell but cannot see, you hateful neighbor!
Pride, monomania, everything from Earth, topaz vapor
Hi-chloridize polyethylene resin lacquered newspaper
Buried alive

Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm waking for the day
