Run it up, run it up, baby, run it up
Run it up, run it up, baby, run it up
Run it up, run it up, baby
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow
Run it up, run it up, baby, run it up
Run it up, run it up, baby, run it up
Run it up, run it up, baby
Slow, slow, slow, slow, she cold
Canada, Canada, baby, Canada
Run it up, run it up, baby, run it up
Run it up, run it up, baby, run it up
Run it up, run it up, baby
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow

5 A.M., just closed, gotta sweep the lobby
Made a grip, 'bouta grip the grain
Gotta say it's quite impressive how ya
The morning shift and make it all syncopate
Chop, chop to the gwuap
Numb chuckles, karate, do you ever really get a break?
Never been the type to need
Help with the hands or the fighting
'Cause she knows how throw that weight

Make that ass aviate
Ummm, take flight
Zoooom, late night
Mmmmm, to this song

She appeal to the masses
Matching a laugh and relaxing
Ashes smeared deep in the mattress
Dick in you deep as a canvas
Old nigga regular average
Headboard banging the address
Next door
