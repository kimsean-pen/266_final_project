On the last weekend before the fall
Down at the beach carnival
Spinning slowly with the carousel
Your gold hoop earrings go so well
With the little yellow light
Shining on a foggy day
Painting you a pretty shade
Like you were a girl in a water color

I could try but I can't explain
How I do, I just know it
Something super natural
And I'm feeling super natural
I don't know how but I can say
That I found my religion
When nothing was ahead of us
That week in California

Hold on, won't the water be too cold?
Out of your mind and you're still so photogenic
I like the lighting on you right at sundown
We've talked too much to ever go back to the way it was

I could try but I can't explain
How I do, I just know it
It's something super natural
And I'm feeling super natural
I don't know how but I can say
That I found my religion
When nothing was ahead of us
That week in California

Maybe I imagined it being so good
Man, it seems like everything I remember doing
We were in a cloud and I can't tell if it was in my head
Or in San Francisco

I could try but I can't explain
How I do, I just know it
It's something super natural
And I'm feeling super natural
I don't know how but I can say
That I found my religion
When nothing was ahead of us
That week in California
