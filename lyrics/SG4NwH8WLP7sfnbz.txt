There's a colour of my heart in
the light and the dark and it's blue.
In the dusk and the dawn
and the time in between it's just blue.
The beginning and end of a season
is simple and blue.
I'm a literal fool, an apprentice,
a rebel of blue.

There's a colour of my heart
in the light and the dark and it's blue.
In the dusk and the dawn
and the time in between it's just blue.
Dreamy eyes, dreamy eyes,
dreamy eyes, dreamy eyes.

I'd say, "being a man of today
is so hard I get blue".
You'd say, "speaking like that
to a woman is sexist and rude".
I'd say, "what do you mean
we're the same I'm a feminist, too.
It's no structural harm or offence
I'm just spilling my blues."

There's a colour of my heart
in the light and the dark and it's blue.
In the dusk and the dawn
and the time in between it's just blue.
Dreamy eyes, dreamy eyes,
dreamy eyes, dreamy eyes.

We keep striking our hearts
with the paw of a bear.
For a slip of the tongue
and a truth we can't hear.
We keep clinging to the dream
when the nightmare is beginning.
And we're put through the test
with our hearts in a mess.
We know all the theories
and see what is there.
But the longer we struggle
the harder we fall.
Though we don't even know
what we want anymore.

So we strike at our hearts
with the paw of a bear.
For a slip of the tongue
and a truth we can't hear.
We keep clinging to the dream
when the nightmare is upon us.
And we're put through the test
with our hearts in a mess.
We know all the theories
and see what is there
but the longer we struggle
the harder we fall
though we noticed when we lost it.
