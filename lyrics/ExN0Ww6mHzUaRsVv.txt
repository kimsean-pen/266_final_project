I am the one you think of when you're with her
And what do you have?
Nothing on me
Just some regrets and a plea

I don't think I know who you are anymore
And I don't think I knew who I was before
In my own home I've never been more
Unsure, no

I didn't waste my time
You were never mine
I didn't waste my time
You were never mine

Pictures of me will not fade
From your head
They're none of which you can replace
In your bed

I don't think I know who you are anymore
And I don't think I knew who I was before
Did you know who I was before?

I didn't waste my time
You were never mine
I didn't waste my time
You were never mine

I don't think I know who you are anymore
Did you know who I was?
