I should wear a sign that says, "Stay away, please"
It's never too cold in the city for me
My mom called, she said I'm living in a fantasy
She said I need to go to therapy
It's like my brain got it out for me
Telling secrets to my enemies
Convince my lungs they don't got to breathe
And told my eyes they don't got to see

Every night I tell myself
I might be alone forever
Wrap my arms around myself
Always thought I'd

Never let you go
Never let you go
You're the only happy place I know
Never let you go

I fell asleep on the couch again
Slept with misery 'cause I let him in
I talk myself my up, but it depends
How far do I wanna fall back
And I'm looking in the mirror like "I hate you"
Sipping on this wine like it's grape juice
Throwing up this wine like, "That wasn't grape juice"
(Ew, I love you)

Never let you go
Never let you go
You're the only happy place I know
Never let you go

Every night I tell myself
I might be alone forever
Wrap my arms around myself
Promise I will

Never let you go
Never let you go
You're the only happy place I know
Never let you go
(Never let you go, never let you go)
(Never let you go, never let you go)
Never let you
