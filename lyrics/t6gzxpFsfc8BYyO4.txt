Another night of maybe and almost
Abandoned in a land of passing ghosts
Just a lot of sad people, forgive them, Lord
They don't care what they do or who they do it to

At the dog and pony show
They don't wanna know
To think I could have stayed home

Instead of watching this ugly lust and ordinary dirt
But no one cares so nobody gets hurt
Just a lot of sad people, forgive them, Lord
They don't care who they do or what it does to you

At the dog and pony show
They don't wanna know
They're doing some blow

They all stand in line and take their chances
Ropynhol and robot dances, dying to get off

There's a lot of pretty girls here looking tight
They're not good girls but they're good for the night
They're telling me to buzz off
Well, that's okay because I never liked them anyway

It's no place for a mongrel mutt like me
Mating rights go to the best of breed
Just a lot of sad people caught in between desire and despair
I guess I'll see you there

At the lost and lonely dog and pony show
They don't wanna know
They don't wanna know
They don't wanna know

So afraid and alone
