If it makes you, it takes you I don't want to
If it makes you, scared in the bare anyway
If it makes you, I don't want to see your face when you feel not alive

You're lying in bed, with the pride of a lion
You are there, you are there?
You're shrewd enough to be underlined
You are there, you are there?

A world premiere.

If it makes you, it takes you I don't want to
If it makes you, stare in the bare anyway
If its the last thing you do...
If its the last thing you do...
If its the last thing you do,

Plagerize.

You're lying in bed, with the pride of a lion
You are there, you are there?
If your shrewd enough to be underlined
You are there, You are there?

A world premiere.

You're lying in bed, with the pride of lion
Are you there? are you there?
You're shrewd enough to be underlined
You are there, you are there?

Mother said to me, "Take my advice please".
And stand for one second up off your knees.
We are not the competition
But we strive, we strive, to be number one.
