It ain't in your city
And it ain't L.A.
We ain't got no rooftop bars
Like they do on Broadway
It's just a little town square
Middle of nowhere
Ain't even big enough to be a map dot
We ain't got a lot,
but we sure do a lot with the little bit that we got

We got a little some, some'in we can throw on ice
Find us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon's up high
Weekend girl and your boys, by a fire, makin' noise
In a field on a Friday night
We got some sure straight songs that we turn up loud
Living it up 'till the sun comes back around
Who said there's nothin' to do?
Who said there's nothin' to do?
Who said there's nothin' to do?
In this nothin'-to-do town

You're already livin'
No, it ain't complicated
Don't knock 'till you try it
Yeah, you might not hate it
Around here we workin' with play
Cussin' with pray
And at the end of a long hard day

We got a little some, some'in we can throw on ice
Find us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon's up high
Weekend girl and your boys, by a fire, makin' noise
In a field on a Friday night
We got some pretty good songs that we turn up loud
Living it up 'till the sun comes back around
Who said there's nothin' to do?
Who said there's nothin' to do?
Who said there's nothin' to do?
In this nothin'-to-do town

It's just a little town square
Middle of nowhere
Ain't even big enough to be a map dot
We ain't got a lot,
but we sure do a lot with the little bit that we got

We got a little some, some'in we can throw on ice
Find us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon's up high
Weekend girl and your boys, by a fire, makin' noise
In a field on a Friday night
We got some Tim McGraw songs that we turn up loud
Living it up 'till the sun comes back around
Who said there's nothin' to do?
Who said there's nothin' to do?
Who said there's nothin' to do?
In this nothin'-to-do town
Our little nothin'-to-do town
