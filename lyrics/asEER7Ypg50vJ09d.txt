Stone of power, stone of light
The stone at Dowth will end this fight
I'll bury the book for ages to come
Beneath the stone of the seven suns

Once I lay on a battlefield in pain,
I cried out in hate and Biróg came
The seeds of vengeance had been sown
With Biróg's help I unleashed the Fomor

Led by Balor, their evil lord
Fomorian hordes rushed ashore
Their war-horns calling to attack
To crush the Dé Danann and claim the land

That day the plains were drenched in blood
The people slaughtered, the children dead
The Fomorian horde swept over the land
Their weapons of carnage reaping the men

Stone of power, stone of light
The stone at Dowth will end this fight
I'll bury the book for ages to come
Beneath the stone of the seven suns

Vengeance no longer rules my soul
The proud Dé Danann remain proud no more
At the side of the oppressed I've ever belonged
The Fomorian scourge must be destroyed

Blinded by hatred, heartbreak and dismay
I condemned the Dé Danann to a terrible fate
No longer shall this horror prevail
Tonight I'll end the Fomorian reign

Stone of power, stone of light
The stone at Dowth will end this fight
Their evil souls shall be unbound
Forever trapped beneath the mound

At Moytirra they shall fight in vain
Their mortal bodies can now be slain
Beneath the everlasting stone
Their souls will haunt forevermore
