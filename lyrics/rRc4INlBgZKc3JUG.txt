Dumb silence doesn't pay
I've said three words again today
Each one just fell away
In lonely echoplay
Echoplay, Echoplay

And when the room is empty
Its subtle tricks protect me
There goes another day
In lonely echoplay

And when the stars are bright
I am living for the night
There's nothing more to say
It's only echoplay
Echoplay, Echoplay
