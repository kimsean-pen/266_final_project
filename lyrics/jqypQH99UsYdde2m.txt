Why can't I be the one you look up to?
And there's two things I wanna do
Like learn to dance and go back to high school
I'm alive and you're on apartment floors
Why can't you leave? I'm waiting for more excuses

Why can't I be the one you look up to?
And there's two things I have to do
Like learn to sleep and come back and see you
With old tattoos, I'm playing your face and I'm pissed off
Not fond of you and I'll see the time on my wristwatch

I'll make a point and I'll see you all in the summer time
Goodbyes in daytime never wanted to control my thoughts
