On the fifth storey block you can't seem to keep away
From the edge,
When you're getting pushed off you're thinking this is
Gonna be the end,
You keep on falling, keep on falling till you awake

Sweet danger, sweet danger
Sweet danger, sweet danger

Trying to get away from, something drives you out
Wherever you go,
The harder you try the more your legs don't want to
Know,
Please wake up, please wake up, you'll have an attack

Sweet danger, sweet danger
Sweet danger, sweet danger

When you're there nightly and you ought to know the
End of the scene,
You got to get up somehow, till you realise it's only
A dream,
Please wake up, please wake up, it's only a dream

Sweet danger, sweet danger
Sweet danger, sweet danger
