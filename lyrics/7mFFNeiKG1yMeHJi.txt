There was a time
I'd take a chance
Make love to you

Those were the days
The fearless days
When love was new

You made me laugh
The way you danced
Was truly fun

We had a dream
We had a style
A real good time

Won't give you up
Won't give you up
(I'm not that kind)

Won't give you up
Won't give you up
(I'd lose my mind)

Now here we stand
You are my rock
So strong and free

A love so blind
A perfect kiss
Make love to me

Won't give you up
Won't give you up
(I'm not that kind)

Won't give you up
Won't give you up
(I'd lose my mind)

Won't give you up
Won't give you up
(I'm not that kind)

Won't give you up
Won't give you up
(I'd lose my mind)

Won't give you up
Won't give you up
(I'm not that kind)

Won't give you up
Won't give you up
(I'd lose my mind)

Won't give you up
Won't give you up
(I'm not that kind)

Won't give you up
Won't give you up
(I'd lose my mind)
