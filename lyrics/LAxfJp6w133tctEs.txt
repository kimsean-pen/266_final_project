When you first left me I was wanting more
But you were kissing that girl next door,
what ya do that for (What ya do that for?).
When you first left me I didn't know what to say
I never been on my own that way,
Just sat by myself all day

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end.
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

At first when I see you cry,
Yeah it makes me smile,
Yeah it makes my smile.
At worst I feel bad for a while,
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

Whenever you see me
You say that you want me back (want me back)
And I tell you it don't mean jack (don't mean jack)
no it don't mean jack (no it dont mean jack)
I couldn't stop laughing, no I just could help myself
See you messed up my mental health
I was quite unwell

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

At first when I see you cry,
Yeah it makes me smile,
Yeah it makes my smile
At worst I feel bad for a while,
but then I just smile
I go ahead and smile

Lalala lalala lalala lalala
Lalala lalala lalala lalala
Lalala lalala lalala lalala
Lala la

At first when I see you cry (see you cry),
yeah it makes me smile (makes me smile),
Yeah it makes my smile (makes me smile)
At worst I feel bad for a while (feel bad for awhile)
But then I just smile (but then I just smile)
I go ahead and smile (go ahead and smile)

At first when I see you cry (see you cry)
Yeah it makes me smile (makes me smile)
Yeah it makes my smile (yeah makes me smile)
At worst I feel bad for a while (feel bad for awhile)
But then I just smile (smile)
I go ahead and smile (Go ahead and smile)
