You wanna know
Know where the heat is
It's in our blood
Take off your clothes
I know it's freezing
We're warm enough

Oh, we're running out into the wild
Don't know what we're trying to find
But we need it
Oh, we're running out into the dark
Running on a broken heart

We're following the siren call
We're chasing shadows of a feeling
Out in the middle of it all
Find out we're bigger than our demons
Into the wild

Oooh
Into the wild
Oooh
Into the wild, into the wild

Been here before
We know the language
Let's speak it now
It's only us
Human nature
It's all around
Oh, we're running out into the wild
Don't know what we're trying to find
But we need it
Oh, we're running out into the dark
Running on a broken heart

We're following the siren call
We're chasing shadows of a feeling
Out in the middle of it all
Find out we're bigger than our demons
Into the wild

Oooh
Into the wild
Oooh
Into the wild

Following the animal inside
Running 'cause there's nowhere left to hide
Into the wild
Into the wild

Oooh
Oooh
Into the wild
Oooh
Into the wild, into the wild
