I'm free this time, and I surrounded mankind
there's nothing here now but you
while gravity never used to bother me
I'm floating senseless in the presence of you
and I see euphoria in what we do

This world is closing in, and while I don't feel a thing
we've lost the air on innocence we shared
once at peace, once so calm
whatever woke me up now it's calling me home

This world is closing in, and while I don't feel a thing
we've lost the air on innocence we shared
once at peace, once so calm
whatever woke me up now it's calling me home

Morphine slumber, in haze of wonders
enter womb-shaped rooms where can be safe
vision blurred by an opiate sky
sedated while your world starts to quake
I forgot how affection used to taste

This world is closing in, and while I don't feel a thing
we've lost the air on innocence we shared
once at peace, once so calm
whatever woke me up now it's calling me home

This world is closing in, and while I don't feel a thing
we've lost the air on innocence we shared
once at peace, once so calm
whatever woke me up now it's calling me home
