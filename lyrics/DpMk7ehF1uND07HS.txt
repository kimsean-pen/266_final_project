Dive a little bit further
Don't get out, the morning wants to keep us safe in here
Resting on your shoulder
We won't go, until there's no more people out there

You can make it click
Making me pop
Going for the goal
With the clean cut
Searching no more
All melodies
Are coming ashore
Flushing over me

Your are all over my rainbow
Taking the scene
In my crazy dream
Only you are on my rainbow
No one else here
Nothing else gets near
You

Nothing's fast or slow
Its in between
Were red and green
Where land and oceans meet
Peacefully I'm quiet
Cause nothing here is
Mad, bad or dangerous to know

You can make it click
Making me pop
Going for the goal
With the clean cut
Searching no more
All melodies
Are coming ashore
Flushing over me

You are all over my rainbow
Taking the scene
In my crazy dream
Only you are on my rainbow
No one else here
Nothing else gets near
You

You can make it click
making me pop

You can make it click
making me pop

You can make it click
making me pop

You can make it click
making me pop

You are all over my rainbow

You can make it click
making me pop

You can make it click
making me pop

And this feeling shows how to make a rainbow
