Well, I ain't superstitious,
black cat just cross my trail
Well, I ain't superstitious,
oh, the black cat just cross my trail
Don't sweep me with no broom,
I might get put in jail

When my right hand itches,
I gets somebody for sure
When my right hand itches,
I gets somebody for sure
But when my left eye jump,
somebody got to go

Well, the dogs are howlin'
all over the neighborhood
Whoa, the dogs are howlin'
all over the neighborhood
That is true sign of death,
baby, that ain't no good

Well, I ain't superstitious,
black cat just cross my trail
Well, I ain't superstitious,
black cat just cross my trail
Don't sweep me with no broom,
I just might get put in jail
