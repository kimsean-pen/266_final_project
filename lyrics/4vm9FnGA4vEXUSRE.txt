Crush my... little lungs
Hope I see you in the audience
I don't think this life is very fun
Drink all night catch eyes with everyone

These lights they keep on whistling
And I don't think it's time for this again
Crease my pants and tie my collar in
This old bitch lost weight and collagen

Blowing up the heating on the porch side
Breath it when she me got me with that neck bite
Don't need her but i want her like a fist fight, ay
Bad to the bottom till my... die, ay

Blowing up the heating on the porch side
Breath it when she me got me with that neck bite
Don't need her but i want her like a fist fight, ay
Bad to the bottom till my... die, ay

Keep it by my bedside, on hip my bed bites
Reaper rocking tie dye, burn that shit like campfire
Speak it like i'm sure, she don't wanna cause
She don't wanna die, think I saw her my...

But I don't ever lie, so I just tell it like It is
Tell it like it is or you'll get caught up in that mid draw
Sucking on a cigarette you could die by pitch fork
I don't wanna answer it, and slide it to the destroy

I've seen you face before, walkin through the door
With a bright smile in your eyes, taking time to recognize
It'll never be the same, I'm hoping for the rain
Cleanse the ruff stuff covered us, Enter new morn without fuss

Stay home stay home stay home
Stay home stay home stay always
Grips on my hair hands on my waist
Sugar in the morning triple ace -ay

Blowing up the heating on the porch side
Breath it when she me got me with that neck bite
Don't need her but i want her like a fist fight ay
Bad to the bottom till my... die, ay

Blowing up the heating on the porch side
Breath it when she me got me with that neck bite
Don't need her but i want her like a fist fight, ay
Bad to the bottom till my... die, ay

We can remain dancer out here on the sand dust
Number one romancer then treat you like cancer
All my power to people still battling with their evils
But you shit just isn't fair lord forbid me to ever care

And its ashes to ashes we still both feeling like its mutual
Back it on back of everything crack a fat while I'm listening
Cause usually I'm on the brink of failing remain to hold it together
With spit and bodily fluid put neck and back

Into it I'm through it and
Remain to hold it together and push my power to pleasure
Just to forget what the weather is like on the other side of Kansas
City people are pretty tap ankles with ruby shoes

Just to get me into the mood not being rude
I'm just seeing the engine like europeans, go harder the 90 BM's
Crack it I'm on a mission don't listen to all the visions
They're missing a piece of brain and still flocking like 40 (ay)

Blowing up the heating on the porch side
Breath it when she me got me with that neck bite
Don't need her but i want her like a fist fight ay
Bad to the bottom till my... die, ay

Blowing up the heating on the porch side
