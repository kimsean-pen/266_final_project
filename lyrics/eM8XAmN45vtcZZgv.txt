Say you're sorry
(Won't you please?)
Say you're sorry

Circus of silence down at our feet
Paper cut tigers starting to bleed
Hang from your tightrope above the mess
Just say you're sorry, no more no less

Words you won't use
You don't feel them like I do
Show will be over soon

It's not the curtain closing causing us to call it a day
I wanna walk away too
But I want you to say you are sorry
I'm not the one who went and made a mistake
I wanna walk away too
But I want you to say you are sorry

Say you're sorry
Say you're sorry
Say you're sorry

I used to believe that the storybook's true
Now I don't need it, at least not with you
So if you see him, the man 'neath the mask
Tell him I'm leaving and not looking back

Words are no use
You don't need them like I do
Show will be over soon

It's not the curtain closing causing us to call it a day
I wanna walk away too
But I want you to say you are sorry
I'm not the one who went and made a mistake
I wanna walk away too
But I want you to say you're sorry

I want the one word that you refuse to say to me
You're so good at giving me responsibility
And I wash my hands clean and let you watch me as I go
And I'm sorry for you, just so you know

It's not the curtain closing causing us to call it a day
I wanna walk away too
But I want you to say you are sorry
I'm not the one who went and made a mistake
I wanna walk away too
But I want you to say you are sorry

Say you're sorry
Say you're sorry
Say you're sorry

Say you're sorry
Say you're sorry
Say you're sorry
Say you're sorry
