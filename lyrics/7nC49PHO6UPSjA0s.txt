Forced to tryannical design
The clothing so ill fitting on a shell that isn't mine
Body mangled by nature at it's worst
A life so desired leaves a taste of bitter curse

Remove me for this never was my choice
Sick of living falsely- screaming without a voice
Remove me from this encasing I despise-
A world so foreign feeling within a mask of tear filled eyes

This is not a cry for help.
The cocoon will burst, freeing me from this hell

I'm nailed to this earth in the wrong fucking skin
The pain of pushing forward giving way to caving in
I'm nailed to this earth in the wrong fucking skin
The pain of pushing forward giving way to caving in

This is not a cry for help.
The cocoon will burst, freeing me from this hell
