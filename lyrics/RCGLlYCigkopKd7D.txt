There is a crowd in here, that fooled themselves;
they brought their friends, and they made their hell.
They fake their grin, it'll only sell.
I took it all in, but what do I know?

There are a few in here, that hurt themselves;
they kick, and beg, they have a dried-up will.
They call for help, and you know them well.
Are you aware of what I know?

I, I will not surrender
No I, I will not surrender
No I, I will not surrender
No I, I will not surrender

When God falls fast asleep
The kids still dance in city streets
From the white house lawn to the middle east
And all around I'm just saying that this time I feel it now

When God falls fast asleep
The kids still move to a steady beat
Even if its bombs landing at their feet
Or all around I'm just saying that this time I feel it now

There is a place to hide
Its in our minds
Its in the dark
Its well known
That we have a fragile heart
Its deep inside
It has a sound that you can follow
You feel like you hit a wall
But you survived
And it was hard for you to swallow
Ive been to that place before
In spite of luck
When you await a new tomorrow

I, I will not surrender
No I, I will not surrender
No I, I will not surrender
No I, I will not surrender

When God falls fast asleep
The kids still dance in city streets
From the white house lawn to the Middle East
And all around I'm just saying that this time I feel it now

When God falls fast asleep
The kids still move to a steady beat
Even if its bombs landing at their feet
Or all around I'm just saying that this time I feel it now

When God falls fast asleep
The kids still dance in city streets
From the white house lawn to the Middle East
And all around I'm just saying that this time I feel it now

When God falls fast asleep
The kids still move to a steady beat
Even if its bombs landing at their feet
Or all around I'm just saying that this time I feel it now

I feel it now
This time I feel it now
I feel it now
This time I feel it now

Oh oh oh oh oh
Yea ah oh oh oh oh oh
Yea ah oh oh oh oh oh
Yea ah oh oh oh oh oh
(This time I feel it now)
