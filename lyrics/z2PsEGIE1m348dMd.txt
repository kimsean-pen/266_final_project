Your road is paved yet coloured in black
Concealed by the night, it remains
Undiscovered until the dawn
Hidden from the light, it remains
When night confines you
Take my torch
Illuminate
Your God might not try[?]
Light your way
Illuminate
No ray meets your eyes
Find your day
Molded by the dark
Where your shelter lies
Covering your path
Invisible
The fire slowly dies
Couldn't stop your cries
Hidden by your wrath
Invisible
Invisible
Illuminate
Your God might not try[?]
Light your way
Illuminate
No ray meets your eyes
Find your day
Illuminate
Your God might not try[?]
Light your way
Illuminate
No ray meets your eyes
Find your day
Waiting for someone
Daring to see
Shades on your pathway
Leading to me
