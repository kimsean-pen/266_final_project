Me, oh my, you thought you had something strong
Me, oh my, it turned out that you were wrong
Me, oh my, your luck seems to be no more
Frightened to get up, fallen to the floor
Me, oh my, you say what you're going through
Funny you forgot 'cause that's the same thing from you

If you wanna complain

I'm not the complaint department

If you wanna complain
If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department

If you wanna complain
If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department
If you wanna complain

Me, oh my, you thought you had something strong
Me, oh my, it turned out that you were wrong
If you wanna complain
Me, oh my, you your luck seems to be no more
If you wanna complain
Frightened to get up, fallen to the floor

If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department
If you wanna complain
I'm not the complaint department

If you wanna complain
