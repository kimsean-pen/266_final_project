Canadian mounted, baby
Police force at work
Red and black
It's their color scheme
Get their man
In the end
It's all right... it's all right
It's all right... it's all right
It's all right... ah yeah my honies know it's all right
It's all right... it's all right
It's all right... it's all right
It's all right... ah yeah baby knows it's all right
You'd kill, you'd maim... ah, c'mon kill 'em
You'd kill, you'd maim... look out

C'mon my husky

Frontenac chateau baby
I cross the frontier at ten
I got a whip in my hand, baby
And a girl or a husky
At leather's end

It's all right... it's all right
It's all right... it's all right
It's all right... ah yeah baby knows it's all right
It's all right... it's all right
It's all right... it's all right
It's all right... yeah baby yeah it's all right
You'd kill, you'd maim... ah, c'mon kill 'em now
You'd kill, you'd maim

Hornswoop me bungo pony on dogsled on ice
Make a dash for freedom baby
Don't skate on polar ice
It's too think to be sliced
By the light
Of long and white polar nights

It's all right... it's all right
It's all right... it's all right
It's all right... yeah baby knows it's all right
It's all right... it's all right
It's all right... it's all right
It's all right... yeah knows it's all right
You'd kill, you'd maim... ah, c'mon kill 'em now
You'd kill, you'd maim... maim 'em too
Ah, break it up
