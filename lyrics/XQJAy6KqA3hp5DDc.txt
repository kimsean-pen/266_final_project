You seem to think that it's a game
I wish I could recall your name
You tell me how I should behave
Sling your hook, I ain't your slave

Leave me alone
Get off the phone
I've got a heart of stone

You play emotional roulette
I ain't seen no winners yet
You know you're dancing in the dark
Stay away, I ain't your mark

Leave me alone
Get off the phone
I've got a heart of stone

Take a pick

In every game you hold the ace
But you ain't even in my race
You'll never realise just why
It's just been hello, goodbye

Leave me alone
Get off the phone
I've got a heart of stone

Heart of stone
