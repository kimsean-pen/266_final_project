I know things are getting tougher
When you can't get the top off the bottom of the barrel
The Wide open road to my future now
Is looking fuckin narrow

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing

We get told to decide
Just like as if I'm not gunna change my mind

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing!

What you gonna do with yourself boy
Better make up your mind
What you gonna do with youself Boy
Running out of time

This time I got it all figured out...

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing

And that's fine.
