Oooh

What's the matter?
What's the matter with you lately?
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you lately?

Oh, your love
Is never good enough
Oh, your love is lost on me
You don't know
You don't know
Oh, your love is lost on me

Oooh
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you lately?
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you?

Oh, your love
Is never good enough
Oh, your love is lost on me
You don't know
You don't know
Oh, your love is lost on me

What's the matter?
What's the matter with you lately?
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you lately?

Dreamer, you will waste your time
Do you ever wonder why
We go on and on and on?
Love is gone and gone and gone
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you lately?
