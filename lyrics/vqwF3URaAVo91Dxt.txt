The devil is restless
And I just wanna go down
Leave the rest to your boy
I just wanna go down
Get me up with your lies
I just wanna go down
And everything I confess
Makes me wanna go down

Yes, I'm going, no doubt

When there's sunlight
When it's so, so bright

When it's visible
Every bruise in your skin
I will never pray
If our god's a virgin
He could use some learning

Satan is grinning
And I just wanna go down
Leave the rest to your boy
I just wanna go down
Keep me up with your lies
I just wanna go down
And everything I confess
Is yours now
Down and down and down and down
To the ground

Where there's sunlight
Where it's so, so bright

Open heaven's gate
Gather all insurgents
If they knew you, Kate
They would all be plunging down
They'd be raining down

Spend forever burning
