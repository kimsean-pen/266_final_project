Beans boil in the pot
I'm dancin' from room to room
The sun is setting and the air is hot
Rang Tang Ring Toon

Bugs sounding off their tune
Friends are on their way now, they'll be here soon
Beans boil in the pot
Rang Tang Ring Toon
Toon, toon, toon, toon

Beans boil in the pot
I'm dancin' from room to room
The record's spinnin' and the food is hot
Rang Tang Ring Toon

My dog, he is dancing too
If he wasn't dancing with me, he'd dance with you
Beans boil in the pot
Rang Tang Ring Toon
Toon, toon

Beans boil in the pot
I'm dancin' from room to room
The food is gone but the night is not
Rang Tang Ring Toon
Bonfire burnin' blue
The water's full of naked bodies swimming
The water's full, the water's full
The water's full of naked bodies swimming
The water's full, the water's full
The water's full of naked bodies swimming
Swimming, swimming

The water's full, the water's full
The water's full of naked bodies swimming
The water's full, the water's full
The water's full of naked bodies swimming
Swimming, swimming, swimming
Rang Tang Ring Toon
