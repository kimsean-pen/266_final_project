I got troubles Lord, but, not today
'Cause they gonna wash away,
They're gonna wash away.

And I have sins Lord, but not today
'Cause they gonna wash away,
They're gonna wash away.

And I have friends Lord, but not today
'Cause they done washed away,
They done washed away.

Oh, I've been cryin'
And oh, I've been cryin'
And oh, no more cryin'
And oh, no more cryin' here.

We get lonely love but, not today
'Cause we gonna wash away,
we gonna wash away.

And I got troubles Lord, but not today
'Cause they're gonna wash away,
This old woman gonna take them away.
