Well, I don't know why we come here
Guess I just needed the bang
We walk in the beef, and then we pull on the rope
And then the, then the hammer comes down
Cables
Cables
Cables
So I guess they know
I'm not no company man
But I can pull on a rope, I can kill a cow
Fast as any other f**ker can
Cables
Cables
Cables
