All right, peep hole!
We're gonna have a rock 'n' roll party tonight!
Here we go!

I been thinking about you
I been meaning to tell you
Sit down with me let's have a drink
Back when the war ended your great grandfather handwrote
Letters of apology to all of those
Families of men who crewed that U-boat
Haunted 'til his death by that long night off the coast
Your other great-granddad came back from Arnhem
Transformed into a damaged and violent man
Never spoke of the slaughter he witnessed firsthand
This is the world I brought you into, man

All remorse, no rebel
A shell of my former shell
Sit down with me let's have a drink

What have we here?
The dreaded failed imagineer?
His private dismay on public display
Son, do not be alarmed by your old man's tears
"Hey, old man, it's ok. Every dog has his day."

Sit down with me let's have a drink
I been thinking about you
I been meaning to tell you
Sit down with me let's have a drink
