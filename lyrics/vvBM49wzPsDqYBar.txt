Lately I get carried away
I've been living too fast
And end up sleeping too late
And patience is wearing off on me
I've been learning to stop
And I've been learning to wait

And maybe I lost who we are
I jump to the end
That's not how we left it
And maybe the sound of your heart
Gets stuck in my head
So I can't forget

When it was only us
When it was only us

Waiting for a moment away
And they were pulling us under
We got caught in the waves
We won't make it
I still hear what they said
But if we're starting over, I won't listen again

And maybe I lost who we are
I jump to the end
That's not how we left it
And maybe the sound of your heart
Gets stuck in my head
So I can't forget

When it was only us
When it was only us
When it was only us

Face it, take it
We can't fake the fall
It's not a race at all
It was a week ago
In those vacant spaces
It wasn't our fault
We were torn apart
And now we can't let go of

When it was only us
When it was only us
When it was only us
