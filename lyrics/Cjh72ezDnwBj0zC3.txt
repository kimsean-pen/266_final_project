Won't let it go
It's creeping along
A deep lack of guilt and
A fools sense of love

You could say it's nothing
You could claim there's no one to hide
You could be respectable and keep it to yourself at least
Cuz I know she was the best that you've had
Cuz I know she was the best that you've had

Greased and unclean
A hiss laid by God
A duped bridal hole and
A boyhood slipping in blood

You could say it's nothing
You could claim there's no one to hide
You could be respectable and keep it to yourself at least
Cuz I know she was the best that you've had
Yes I know she was the best that you've had

V-U-L-T-U-R-E-P-I-A-N-OH!

You could say it's nothing
You could claim there's no one to hide
You could be respectable and keep it to yourself at least
Cuz I know she was the best that you've had
Yes I know she was the best that you've had
