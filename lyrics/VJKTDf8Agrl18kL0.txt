All I need is something to get me through the night
Just a little distraction from the echoes in my mind
Don't talk about a revolution to make me feel alive
All I need is a solution for me to make you mine

We can close our eyes
We can waste some time
If you can read my mind
Don't stop before we go
Don't stop before we go blind

All I need's an ocean and some waves to break me down
Searching for absolution in some place I haven't found
Don't tell me it's my own delusion that keeps me up at night
All I need's a solution for me to make you mine

We can close our eyes
We can waste some time
If you can read my mind
Don't stop before we go
Don't stop before we go blind

These faded spaces
That I love creating
I can feel them chasing
I can feel them chasing

Will I close my eyes?
Can we waste some time?
And you can read my mind
Don't stop before we go
Don't stop before we go blind
