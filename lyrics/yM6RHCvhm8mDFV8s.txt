I am the outlaw who forever rides
the cry of freedom hunted day and night

Forever united, to an oath we bound
We stand defiant
We stand shoulder to shoulder

We are the outlaws, who will always defy
We'll stand united
As brothers, side by side

And if wolves you desire
then wolves we'll be
Bound together by ferocious loyalty

Boundless and free you ride as kings
Eagles on iron wings
Hold to your word to stand to the last
Like a fox on the run with the hounds at ya back

So mark my words, you'll surely be next
They'll shackle all us with our silent consent
So heed these words, with all their intent
Divided we fall, or we stand united

Boundless and free you ride as kings
Eagles on iron wings
Hold to your word to stand to the last
Like a fox on the run with the hounds at ya back
