High heels on my neck when you're dancing
I sleep on a valium, I dream about nothing
Cash American, bag Italian
I'mma mix the medicine, demons I let 'em in
You're embarrassing, who take care of him
I'mma take care of her, I would do anything
Purple and blue, pockets glittering
I don't do twittering, I am the Wickrman

One step and two back, dirty dancing
Blow my nose, now it's blood in a napkin
Bugs crawl out the walls and we kill them
Bug lose it's children, one in a million
High heels on my heart when you hold me
And it's piercing through me, you don't even know it
I'mma make it fast just to blow it
Throw it for you baby, fuck if they hate on me
Fuck if they hate on me, 6 German E's on me
I know they wait on me, I feel them breath on me
I'm not really me, I'm just acting
You feel like heroin, make me do anything

High heels on my neck when you're dancing
I sleep on a valium, I dream about nothing
Cash American, bag Italian
I'mma mix the medicine, demons I let 'em in
You're embarrassing, who take care of him
I'mma take care of her, I would do anything
Purple and blue, pockets glittering
I don't do twittering, I am the Wickrman

You're embarrassing, who take care of him
I'mma take care of her, I would do anything
Purple and blue, pockets glittering
