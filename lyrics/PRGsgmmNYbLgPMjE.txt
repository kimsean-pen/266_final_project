Loving strangers, loving strangers, loving strangers, oh
Loving strangers, loving strangers, loving strangers, oh

I've got a hole in my pocket
where all the money has gone
I've got a whole lot of work
to do with your heart
cause its so busy, mines not.

Loving strangers, loving strangers, loving strangers, oh
Loving strangers, loving strangers, loving strangers, oh

It's just the start of the winter
and I'm all alone
and I've got my eye right on you
give me a coin and I'll take you to the moon
give me a beer and I'll kiss you so foolishly,
like you do when you lie, when youre not in my thoughts,
like you do when you lie and I know its not my imagination

Loving strangers, loving strangers, loving strangers, oh
Loving strangers, loving strangers, loving strangers, oh

Loving strangers, loving strangers, loving strangers, oh, oh
Loving strangers, loving strangers, loving strangers, oh.
