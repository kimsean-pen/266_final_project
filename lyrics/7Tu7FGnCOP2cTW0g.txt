Oh, hello . . .
i am the ghost of troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
i travelled to a mystical time zone
and i missed my bed
and i soon came home
They said:
"there's too much caffeine . . . "
"in your bloodstream . ., "
"and a lack of real spice . . . "

"in your life . . . "
i said:
"leave me alone . . . "
"because i'm alright, dad . . . "
"surprised to still . . . "

"be on my own . . . "
oh, but don't mention love
i'd hate the strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and i

they take what they need,
and just leave
oh, but don't mention love
i'd hate the pain of the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?

and people who are weaker than you or i
they take what they want from life
oh, but don't mention love
no - no, don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
