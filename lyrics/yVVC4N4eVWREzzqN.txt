Breakdown

Let the fun and games begin
She is spayed and broken in
Skin is cold and white
Such a lovely, lonely night
Heaven is on the way
You could feel the hate, but I guess you never will
I'm on a roll again and I want an end
'Cause I feel you creeping in

What I've found in this town
I'm heading for a breakdown
What's that sound?
You're so loud
I'm heading for a breakdown, no!

Drank up all my alcohol
This is not a free for all
I'll be there for you
Till my heart is black and blue
Heaven is on the way
You could feel the hate, but I guess you never will
I'm on a roll again and I want an end
'Cause I feel you creeping in

What I've found in this town
I'm heading for a breakdown
What's that sound?
You're so loud
I'm heading for a breakdown

What I've found in this town
I'm heading for a breakdown
What's that sound?
You're so loud
I'm heading for a breakdown
You breakdown, you're so proud
I'm heading for a breakdown
What's that sound?
You're so loud
I'm heading for a breakdown, no!
