Close the door
Take it off of me
Take it off for me
Clothes on the floor
This misery
Loves company

Compulsive indulgence
We're making love out of focus
You'll always be my white rabbit
My favorite bad habit

A rush of blood to my head
My heart beats out of my chest
Bad habits
Bad habits
I said never again
But here you are in my bed
Bad habits
Bad habits

With you, you
Bad habits
Bad habits
With you, you
Bad habits, ooh
Bad habits

We keep secrets
Tell white lies
While we chase the highs
In each other's eyes
We can't stop this though we tried
We'll have superpowers in the afterhours 'til the day we die

Compulsive indulgence
We're making love out of focus
You'll always be my white rabbit
My favorite bad habit

A rush of blood to my head
My heart beats out of my chest
Bad habits
Bad habits
I said never again
But here you are in my bed
Bad habits
Bad habits

With you, you
Bad habits
Bad habits
With you, you
Bad habits, ooh
Bad habits

Let's go down the rabbit hole
Steal a kiss and in we fall
Let's go down the rabbit hole
Dirty pretty things and all
Let's go down the rabbit hole
Steal a kiss and in we fall
Let's go down the rabbit hole
Dirty pretty things and all

Compulsive indulgence
We're making love out of focus
You'll always be my white rabbit
My favorite bad habit
Compulsive indulgence
We're making love out of focus
You'll always be my white rabbit
My favorite bad habit

A rush of blood to my head
My heart beats out of my chest
Bad habits
Bad habits
I said never again
But here you are in my bed
Bad habits
Bad habits

With you, you
Bad habits
Bad habits
With you, you
Bad habits, ooh
Bad habits

Compulsive indulgence
We're making love out of focus
You'll always be my white rabbit
My favorite bad habit

Let's go down the rabbit hole
Steal a kiss and in we fall
Let's go down the rabbit hole
Dirty pretty things and all
