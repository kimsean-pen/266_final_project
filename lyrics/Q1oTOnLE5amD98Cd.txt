Early in the morning
I'm still in bed
She comes to me
With sweet affection
Wakes me with kisses
"Hello sleepyhead"
And gets me moving
In the right direction
I do my best to give her love that lasts forever
It seems like everything I do I'm doing better
Doing it all for my baby
'Cause she's as fine as she can be
I'm doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me

Later in the evening
It's been a busy day
She lays her head
Upon my weary shoulder
Listen to her laughing
Snuggle up and say
Now I'm with you baby
The loneliness is over
I do my best to give her love that lasts forever
It seems like everything I do I'm doing better
Doing it all for my baby
'Cause she's as fine as she can be
Doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me

Doing it all for my baby
'Cause she's as fine as she can be
Doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me
Doing it doing it - doing it doing it doing it yea
Doing it doing it - ooh ooh ooh
Doing it (doing it) doing it (doing it)
Doing it doing it doing it yea
Doing it (doing it) doing it (doing it) - ooh ooh ooh
(Doing it all for my baby) doing it all for my baby
(Doing it all for my baby) she's as fine as she can be
(Doing it all for my baby) doing it all for my baby
(Doing it all for my baby) she's so fine
