I had to escape
The city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first

But I was dying to get to you
I was dreaming while I drove
The long straight road ahead, uh-huh, yeah

Could taste your sweet kisses
Your arms open wide

This fever for you was just
Burning me up inside
I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright?
I drove all night, crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep

To make love to you
Is that alright?
I drove all night
What in this world keeps us
From falling apart?

No matter where I go
I hear the beating of our one heart
I think about you when
The night is cold and dark, uh-huh, yeah

No one can move me
The way that you do
Nothing erases this feeling
Between me and you

I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright?

I drove all night, crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright?
I drove all night
Could taste your sweet kisses
Your arms open wide
This fever for you is just
Burning me up inside
I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright?
I drove all night crept in your room
Is that alright?
I drove all night
I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright?
I drove all night, crept in your room
