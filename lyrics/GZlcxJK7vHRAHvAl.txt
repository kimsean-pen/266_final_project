You could've been all I wanted
But you weren't honest
Now get in the ground
You choked off the sorriest of favors
But if you really loved me
You would've endured my will

Well, you're just as I presumed
You're a whore in sheep's clothing
Fucking up all I do
Yeah and if, oh, here we've stopped
Then never again will you see this in your life

And on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever low
With truth on the shores of confession
You seem to take premise to all of these so...

You stormed off to scar the Armada
Like Jesus played leader
I'll drill through your hands
The stone for the curse you have blamed me

With love and devotion, I'll die as you sleep
But if you could just write me out
To never this wonder
Happy will I become

Be true that this is no option
So, with I condemn you
Demon, pray demon out

And on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever low
With truth on the shores of comfession
You seem to take premise to all of these so...

One last kiss for you
One more wish to you
Please make up your mind girl
I'd do anything for you
One last kiss for you
One more wish to you
Please make up your mind girl
Before I hope you die
