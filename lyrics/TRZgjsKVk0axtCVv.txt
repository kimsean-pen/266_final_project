Together, here we are, boy and girl walk alone
Together moving like clouds
Together billions the soldiers of love in the dark
Together till one will see the light
All the way alone, alone, alone, alone
But together we'll always want to be

Do you wanna keep safe and keep control
And stay rich with your money and decide for it all?
Do you wanna keep safe and keep control
And stay rich with your money and decide for it all?
Do you?

Together the bullets fly just like birds in the sky
Together we're both paralyzed
Together drop by drop one by one til' water falls
If it's a game we're supposed to know we're playing
How come some don't know?
Don't know? Don't know? Don't know?
And together is all they need to be

Do you wanna keep safe and keep control
And stay rich with your money and decide for it all?
Do you wanna keep safe and keep control
And stay rich with your money and decide for it all?
Do you?

Do you wanna keep safe and keep control
And stay rich of your money and decide for it all?
Do you wanna keep safe and keep control
And stay rich of your money and decide for it all?
Do you?

Together here we are, boy and girl walk alone
Together moving like clouds

(together, together, together, together)

Do you wanna keep safe and keep control
And stay rich with your money and decide for it all?
Do you wanna keep safe and keep control
And stay rich with your money and decide for it all?
Do you wanna keep safe and keep control
And stay rich with your money and decide for it all?
Do you wanna keep safe and keep control
And stay rich with your money and decide for it all?
Do you?
