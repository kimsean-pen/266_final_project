Cut out with scissors made of starlight it is
Alright cause you're glowing through the limelight now it's
Hold tight we collide into the satellite
Heart right yeah we're sleeping with the city tonight

This tastes like
We love like

On my hand, on my head, on my chest
I'm dressed up like a girl's best friend
In my heart, in my room, in my bed
You're shining like you're one of them
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh you're like

Lost in your spectrum and your colors you are
Alright no you're nothing like the other's but it's
Don't touch when you're laced up in the velvet rope
I melt when you kiss me yeah you cling to my throat

This tastes like
We love like

On my hand, on my head, on my chest
I'm dressed up like a girl's best friend
In my heart, in my room, in my bed
You're shining like you're one of them
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh you're like

Yeah you're shining like the cartier
You're the rough cut boy at the party babe
I heard you cost a million dollars by the champagne you swallow
You'll be icing out my pockets [?]

100% carbon shape up
Straight up
Crystals in the garden
We love like

On my hand, on my head, on my chest
I'm dressed up like a girl's best friend
In my heart, in my room, in my bed
You're shining like you're one of them
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh you're like
On my hand, on my head, on my chest
I'm dressed up like a girl's best friend
In my heart, in my room, in my bed
You're shining like you're one of them
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh you're like
