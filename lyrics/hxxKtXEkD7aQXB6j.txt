All veiled by sunlight
A murder for evenfall
Where a new dawn resides
Veiled by sunlight
All veiled by sunlight
Of gilded silhouettes
Where long shadows rise

As winds whisper, o' harbinger, lamenting twilight
All drowned within, cold stars ignite
The world closed its eyes

Of Lorelei
Dead dreams rising
Lost to a frayed dimension
And what lies beneath
The labyrinth within the sea
The black skies of twenty thousand leagues

Keelhauled and crippled
Tangled in misery
An abyss of dying dreams
Cascading delirium
