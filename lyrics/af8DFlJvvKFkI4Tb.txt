My, oh, my
Turn around and see that sign
Flashing at you like a light
Think about it more than twice

Because it's high time, it's high time, say bye-bye
We can't keep going on like that
And when you turn it down
Then you'll finally hear that sound

We break down and we break through
Cause we can't touch the sky
But sometimes we can get a little closer
If we let go, stop trying to hold the world

It's like the first time we felt like we could fly
We could fly
Been through the fire, we made it out alive
We're alive

Sp now we try
Earning things we cannot buy
No matter how you roll the die
The thirst could not be satisfied

And you find out the hideout is taking you down
It's just a fantasy
Step towards a love that's free
Send us into ecstasy

We break down and we break through
Cause we can't touch the sky
But sometimes we can get a little closer
If we let go, stop trying to hold the world

It's like the first time we felt like we could fly
We could fly
Been through the fire, we made it out alive
We're alive

Felt like we could fly
Felt like we could fly
Felt like we could fly
Felt like we could fly

It's like the first time we felt like we could fly
We could fly
Been through the fire, we made it out alive
We're alive

(Been through the fire)
(I'm alive)
