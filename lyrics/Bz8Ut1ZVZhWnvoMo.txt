Doreen... don't make me wait
Til tomorrow
Oh-wo-no-oh-wo...
Please darling
Let me love you tonight
An' it'll be awright

You... can't make me say
I don't want you
Oh-wo-no-oh-wo...
My heart
Is burning with love
And I want you tonight

I really love you
You make me feel good
Please don't deceive me
Doreen you know you should
Stay with me always
We could be lovers
Doreen you're different
Then all the... others

Doreen... don't make me wait
Til tomorrow
Oh-wo-no-oh-wo...
Please darling
Let me love you tonight
An' it'll be awright

You... can't make me say
I don't want you
Oh-wo-no-oh-wo...
My heart
Is burning with love
And I want you tonight
