When I got home from [?] road, she looked at me
With eyes as if to say
Just take care of business
Yeah just take care of business

When she sees me above the house in a [?]
Oh, she yells, I hear her say
Just take care of business
Yeah just take care of business

And by the dam below the house with the yellow pit pups
Oh, she ties a rope around
Just take care of business
Just take care of business

And when we kiss I feel her smile, and then she stops
Oh, she stops and looks at me
Just take care of business
Please take care of business

With a metal wreck, with a rusty tool, with snakes below
Ooh, she grabs the axe from me and takes care of business
Ooh, she takes care of business
Ooh, she takes care of business
Ooh, ya gotta take care of business
Ooh, ya gotta take care of business
Ooh, ya gotta take care of business
Ooh, ya gotta take care of business
