It wakes me up and shakes my bones
It makes me miss my friends
You wasted days, I hung my head
I wore these blinders
So I'll hide from you, hide from you

You can hear the sound
Oh, when walls break down
You wasted my days
Building on shaky ground

You can't carry on
Oh, when walls break down
Such wasted days
Building on shaky ground

Sitting face to face, dead tides will rise
Our light is in your eyes
We will be heard, our voice is strong
You shamed yourself
And we're done with you, we're done with you

You can hear the sound
Oh, when walls break down
You wasted my days
Building on shaky ground

You can't carry on
Oh, when walls break down
Such wasted days
Building on shaky ground

This is your life, you led
This is my life, you bled

These tides sweep us out of reach
Well, these tides sweep us out of reach

You can hear the sound
Oh, when walls break down
You wasted my days
Building on shaky ground

You can't carry on
Oh, when walls break down
Such wasted days
And building on shaky ground

This is your life, you led
This is my life, you bled

These tides
Well, these tides sweep us out of reach
These tides sweep us out of reach
These tides
