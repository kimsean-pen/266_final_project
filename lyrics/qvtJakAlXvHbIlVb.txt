He looks at me but I look away
He is my secret lover, I'm his parade
No, I won't die alone
No, I can't let it show

Cause I really love you baby
But I'll never love you baby
You're than enough, it's crazy
But I'll never love you baby

He kisses me but I turn away
He's all I ever wanted, I count the days
No, I won't die alone
No, I can't let it show

Cause I really love you baby
But I'll never love you baby
You're than enough, it's crazy
But I'll never love you baby
