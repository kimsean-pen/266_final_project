I cannot be happy cause I can't make up my mind
All the feelings that I wanna feel are takin' up my time
As I sit and wonder about is this all there is?
There's gotta be some more to life that I don't wanna miss

Dreamin' helps us find the things that we might not have found
But we're chasing them while we're still lyin' face down on the ground
I cannot remember when I started to avoid
Everything and everyone just to keep up my poise

What is this?
I can't miss,
This isn't mine
All the things we're doing just to make up for lost time

All the things we want in life are things we never need
But we cannot stop these thoughts so we keep tearing at the seams
Everything around us we try so hard to ignore
When the most important things we just keep shut behind our doors

Everybody's askin' me just why you're not around
It's better just to tell em' that ya' packed up and left town
I thought I'd be better when I got out on my own
Instead I find I'm more worse off than just my thoughts alone

What is this?
I can't miss,
This isn't mine
All the things we're doing just to make up for lost time

All the things we want in life are things we never need
But we cannot stop these thoughts so we keep tearing at the seams
Everything around us we try so hard to ignore
When the most important things we just keep shut behind our doors
The most important things we just keep shut behind our doors
Shut behind our doors

I'd like to get back all the times that we've missed
So come on, don't lose ground, just move your body let's go
You're just movin' too slow

All the things we want in life are things we never need
But we cannot stop these thoughts so we keep tearing at the seams
Everything around us we try so hard to ignore
When the most important things we just keep shut behind our doors

All the things we want in life are things we never need
But we cannot stop these thoughts so we keep tearing at the seams
Everything around us we try so hard to ignore
When the most important things we just keep shut behind our doors
The most important things we just keep
shut behind our doors

Shut behind our doors
