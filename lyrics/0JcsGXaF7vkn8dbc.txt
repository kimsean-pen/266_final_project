stay
we're already in this
that day
boy i'll be right there with
when your head goes down
when your head goes down
when your head goes down

wait
and let them have their moment
it's way
too soon to even show it
but when the rain comes down
when the rain comes down
when the walls come down
when the walls come down

you were always following me
you never let me be
and you'll always be there
take me to the river and i'll be your angel
and i'll be your angel
you were always following
take me to your place to be
and you'll always be there
take me to the river and i'll be your angel
and i'll be your angel
i wanna be...

but i know that you walk with the devil
but i'll never hold it against you
when your hand goes out
when your hand goes out
when your hand goes out
when my head goes down
when my head goes down
when my head goes down

you were always following me
you never let me be
and you'll always be there
take me to the river and i'll be your angel
and i'll be your angel
