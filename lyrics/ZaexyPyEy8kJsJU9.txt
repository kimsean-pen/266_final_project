Truth will be concealed
I refuse to feel
To suffer is human, I'm using excuses
Anticipate the war
Control the burn before it gets to you
Before dependencies weigh down on me

Life is so unfair, there's always something I can blame
Now ask yourself; how did you hide today?
I control my own fear and my shame
Naked in a world that doesn't owe me anything

Give all you got
Get nothing back
Footprints will leave no impression
Without a weight that I will have to choose to bear
I succumb to short term benefits
Left with long term deficit
The choices I made are not made to help
A bottomless pit always has further down
Save me from myself
Save me from myself

(Groan, like my foundation stone)

Life is so unfair, there's always something I can blame
Now ask yourself; how did you hide today?
I control my own fear and my shame
Naked in a world that doesn't owe me anything

Groan, like my foundation stone
Groan, like my foundation stone
Getting crushed
Getting crushed
Crushed

Anticipate the war
Control the burn before it gets to you
Before dependencies weigh down on me

Life is so unfair, there's always something I can blame
Now ask yourself; how did you hide today?
I control my own fear and my shame
Naked in a world that doesn't owe me anything
