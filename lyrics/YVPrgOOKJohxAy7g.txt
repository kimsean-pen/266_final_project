Is your light always on?
Through the ashen wake
I'll swim with the saved to your door

Are you but a bruise on the sky?
A moral ache?
A reason to live or to die?

So wait for me
Wait for me
Take this weight up from me

If change is a world of regret...
In shallow faith
My lip hooked
How mild I'll ascend!
