Deliver me
From the darkest abyss
From the depths of eternal rest
Grasping at the threads of sanity
Only to watch them slip through my hands

I see the light
I see the end
I see a frail hope
Crushed by the weight of the world

I see the light
I see the end
I see a frail hope
Crushed by the weight of the world
Crushed by the weight of the world
My will is broken
My will is broken

Sinking
Always sinking
The sands of time forever slipping
Clawing at the emptiness
But a ghost I reach towards the end

Lost in darkness
Lost in time
Losing a grip on my fucking mind
Ignorance is an easy friend
But in the end it takes everything

Fear, it finds me and it binds me
Illuminate the planes of consciousness
Fear, it finds me and it binds me
But I'm lost

Guilt draws me down like a stone
it chokes my throat, and gnaws my bones
Regret breeds a heavy heart
Reality
Torn in two
Torn in two
Torn in two

Canonised
Canonised
A life that fades
A life that fades before, before my eyes
Canonised
A life that fades before, before my eyes
Ever faithful friend, sorrow, sets its teeth
Eaten alive
Canonised
A life that fades before, before my eyes
Ever faithful friend, sorrow, sets its teeth
Eaten alive

But I will survive
I survive
Fury, deliver me
How can you defeat what you can't kill?
Deliver me
I see the fear that twists inside
Deliver me
I watch the shadows fill with doubt
Deliver me
Fury deliver me
