I see the ruins of wasted years - left behind to die
I feel the silence closing in and I watch the stars collide
Let us dream and try to breathe
though all life in us is dead
memories – will I awake when I fall asleep?
there are no more roads to run
no one is there when you're falling down
This is a new era
tragedy strikes - suddenly –
I don't know how to escape this
I don't need no one to tell me who to be
there are no more roads to run
another pale hope for life is gone
see my scars right here
the most regrettable fear
see my scars right here
melted out of memories
carved in ivory skin
