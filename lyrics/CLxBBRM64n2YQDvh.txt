Hey I found a whistle that hangs like a charm,
and when my noose is tied I could blow it
and fall down into your arms
15 centuries of dissolution and grief,
to return a yellow trickster and a thief

Hey I found a whistle that works every time
that's when the trail escapes to nowhere,
and the flood erases the crime
such conviction,
to paint all the wall with the blood
of the young and the faithful and the good

Yeah I found a whistle as thin as a sheet
to split the dumbness of a vision
between asleep and a sleep
tiny axes
repeatedly raising the flag
all ignored, real emotion's such a drag

Hey I've got a pistol that's aimed at your heart
and on dark nights when the moon is right
I could show you
the head attached with a scarf
aerophane sorceress, at home obeying the fates
when it's gone, has it gone all the way?

This time
Found a whistle
that works every time
Yeah, I found a whistle
that works
hangs like a charm 'round my neck
Found a whistle
that works every time
Yeah, I found a whistle
that works
closes my mind every time
a whistle,
I've got it!
I've got it!
this time.
