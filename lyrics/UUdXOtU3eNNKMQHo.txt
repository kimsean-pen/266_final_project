My thoughts, my all
stream
out of my conscience
into the darkness.
Behind my words,
my forced
means,
these astral wastelands
unfold their vastness.
Beyond the void.
The facts I bind to,
which keeps me in the clear.
Refute the treason,
constrain it through the air.
My rule,
my will,
inside my circles.
I come to find you
deep in the bottom layer.
Despite your reasons
to hide yourself in there.
Your hurt,
your fear
is where I tap into.
Wait
to see your promise
create the shelter
for all our virtues.
So,
how am I?
A new lease of life
when my comfort
accompanies the waves.
I strive to blind you
'til I discover where
defining freedom
is reconstructed here.
Your rule,
your will,
within your circles.
Make out the beacon,
that has it all resolve.
We set your mind to
how kismet would resolve.
My hurt,
my fear,
is where you tap into.
My thoughts,
my all,
stream
out of my conscience
into the darkness.
Behind my words,
my forced
means,
these astral wastelands
unfold their vastness.
Wait
to see your promise.
Create the shelter
for all our virtues.
So,
how am I?
Past a new lease of life
when my comfort
accompanies the waves.
Please hide, who sees
who we are?
Trust shares all keys,
one knows all.
