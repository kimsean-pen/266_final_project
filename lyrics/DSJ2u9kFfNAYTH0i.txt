Uuuh
THE COLOR of my native skin
Colored into a color never seen
A sun full arises

TRUE FEELING runs across my chest
In my silence there's a color I never see
The sunrise is finding me

And the world on spinning
Dance above the clouds
Hold my world to something
Better make a sound

I found it, moved it alone

Her heart, her heart, her heart
Believe in love

THE COLOR of my name
Is getting caught up between myself
But it's destroying me
Into the color you're making

There's a world out that I'll never see
Shattered fools in memory

Heat of a lover
Heat of a lover
Heat of a lover
Heat of a lover
Heat of a lover
Heat of a lover
Heat of a lover
