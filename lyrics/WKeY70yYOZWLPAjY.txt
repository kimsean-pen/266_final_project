Now it's over
Strike upon me and is gone
What you open
Isn't necessarily what it says on the box
So it's over
The bricks are telling code on me
I said I'm closer
To the morning sunshine down on me

I said it's over
It's not something you need to do
You're getting older
You're getting slower to the
Point where you're no use

So it's over
The bricks are telling code on me
I said I'm closer
To the morning sunshine down on me

You don't know you're crying at all
Because of your firewall
Trapped in the mind of something
Else you've become
You don't know you're crying at all
Because of your firewall
Trapped in the mind of something
Else you've become
It's just the way it's been
When you've gone missing in the action
It's just the way it's been
When you've gone missing in the action

You don't know you're crying at all
Because of your firewall

Now it's over
Strike upon me and is gone
What you open
Isn't necessarily what it says on the box
So it's over
The bricks are telling code on me
I said I'm closer
To the morning sunshine down on me

You don't know you're crying at all
Because of your firewall
Trapped in the mind of
Something else you've become
You don't know you're crying at all
Because of your firewall
Trapped in the mind of
Something else you've become
It's just the way it's been
When you've gone missing in the action
It's just the way it's been
When you've gone missing in the action
