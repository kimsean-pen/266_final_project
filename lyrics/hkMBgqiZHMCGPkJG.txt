Don't lose focus, I don't want to stand in your blind side
Know you working, don't you let it cut into my time
I lose my mind before I see you and I separated, no
I'm so scared to lose you, never choosing to let go
Love's so fragile, anything could happen, and we know
Hearts made of glass, but somehow we last
Yeah we made it, no

I would rather be (rather be)
Without vision before I ever watch you leave (watch you leave)
Got me feelin' like oh-oh-oh
I'd be better off blind (blind)
Oh-oh-oh
I'd be better off blind (blind)

When I close my eyes
All I think about is you
All I think about is you (I'd be better off blind)
When I close my eyes
All I think about is you
All I think about is you (I'd be better off blind)

20/20 really don't mean nothing to me and you
We here looking at the same window with different views (Skee, yuh)
I'll take my time
To read between the faces you're makin' (Makin', makin', makin' yeah)

I would rather be (Rather be)
Without vision before I ever watch you leave (Watch you leave)
Got me feelin' like oh-oh-oh
I'd be better off blind (Blind)
Oh-oh-oh
I'd be better off blind

When I close my eyes
All I think about is you
All I think about is you (I'd be better off blind)
When I close my eyes
All I think about is you
All I think about is you (I'd be better off blind)

This is real love, we don't care (No-no-no)
This is real love, put your hands in the air
Lemme hear you say:
Oh-oh-oh
I'd be better off blind (Let me hear you say)
Oh-oh-oh
I'd be better off blind (Aye, oh, skrrt)
This is real love, we don't care (We don't care)
This is real love, put your hands in the air
Lemme hear you say:
Oh-oh-oh
I'd be better off blind (No)
Oh-oh-oh
I'd be better off blind

When I close my eyes (When I close my eyes)
All I think about is you
All I think about is you (All I think, all I think, all I think, babe)
When I close my eyes (Eyes-oh-oh-oh)
All I think about is you
All I think about is you (Blind, blind)

Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Oh no
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
No, no
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh (Blind)
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
