If you work all day you keep the rhythm through the night
If you work all night you keep the rhythm through the day
If you sell that soul you'll be burning up right
If you ain't got no soul, that's fine, alright

If you work all day you keep the rhythm through the night
If you work all night you keep the rhythm through the day
If you sell that soul you'll be burning up right
If you ain't got no soul, that's fine, alright

All I've ever known is true
Pick it up, pack it up, put it in a bag
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
Until there's nothing left for you
Pick it up, pack it up, put it in a bag
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
Until there's nothing left of you

Keep the rhythm through the night
If you need a little money keep working alright
It'll help that soul, a little help may do some right
You don't need that soul, well that's fine, alright

I work all day, keep the rhythm through the night
I work all night, keep on walking, alright
If you sell that soul, that's fine, alright
If you sell that soul, that's fine, alright

All I've ever known is true
Pick it up and pack it up and put it in a bag

Until there's nothing left for you
We'll pick it up, pack it up, put it in a bag
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
Until there's nothing left of you
