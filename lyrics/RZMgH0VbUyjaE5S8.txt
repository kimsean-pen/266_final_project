Sun, rise
Blood shot eyes.
Head, burns
Cheap white wine.
I remember last night
And it still feels good in the daylight.
No running or hiding
That is, so suddenly surprising.

I don't wanna stay
Maybe im afraid
To find out if you were gonna feel it in a different way.
Any other day
Making my escape
Anything I gotta do, it can wait.

I'm waking up easy
For the first time
I stare at the ceiling
And i don't mind
Cause we could do this all day
Cause we could do this all day
I'm waking up easy
Waking up easy
Waking up easy.
I'm waking up easy
Waking up easy
Waking up easy.

Do you remember me last night?
Cause I was obviously doing something right
But not with the lights on
Well I look different now all the drinks are gone.

Are you gonna stay
Cause now im afraid
To find out if you were gonna feel it in a different way.
I want another day
Yeah, I wanna stay
Anything I gotta do
It can wait.

I'm waking up easy
For the first time
I stare at the ceiling
And I don't mind
Cause we could do this all day
Cause we could do this all day
I'm waking up easy, waking up easy, waking up easy
I'm waking up easy, waking up easy, waking up easy

Maybe it is safe just to walk away, maybe it's safe.
Maybe it is safe just to walk away, maybe it's safe.
Oh maybe I'll stay.

And I'll be waking up easy
For the first time
I stare at the ceiling
And I don't mind
Cause we could do this all day yeah
Cause we could do this all day
I'm waking up easy
For the first time
I stare at the ceiling
And I don't mind
Cause we could do this all day yeah
Yeah we could do this all day
I'm waking up easy, waking up easy, waking up easy
I'm waking up easy, waking up easy, waking up easy oh yeah
I'm waking up easy, waking up easy, waking up easy hmm
