Wait, is this real
It's hard to take in the suffering
Bound by a dream
Can you imagine living in a place
Where waking every day
Didn't feel like we're caged
And have been condemned by the very breathe we take

I'd hold my breathe forever to suffocate the pain I hold inside
I'll tear off my skin
I've been trapped within and blind my burning eyes

Led by the lies
Are we divided by our faith?
Hate has become all that you stand for
Once you are willing to sacrifice the truth to prove you're right

I'd hold my breathe forever to suffocate the pain I hold inside
I'll tear off my skin
I've been trapped within and blind my burning eyes

Cause it's too late to save you from yourself
It's too late!

I'd hold my breathe forever to suffocate the pain I hold inside
I'll tear off my skin
I've been trapped within and blind my burning eyes
