As I was goin' over
The Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell
His money he was countin'

I first produced my pistol
And then produced my rapier
I said, "Stand and deliver"
Or the devil he may take ya

I took all of his money
And it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money
Yeah and I brought it home to Molly

She swore that she'd love me
No never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman!
Yeah!
For you know, she tricked me easy

Musha rain, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Being drunk and weary
I went to Molly's chamber
Taking Molly with me
But I never knew the danger

For about six or maybe seven
Yeah, in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired my pistols
And I shot him with both barrells

Musha rain, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah, yeah, whiskey!
Yeah, oh

Now some men like a-fishin'
And some men like the fowling
And some men like to hear
To hear cannon ball roarin'

Me, I like sleeping
'Specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison
Here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Musha rain, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah!
Whiskey in the jar-o

Musha rain, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Musha rain, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Musha rain, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Musha rain, dum-a-do dum-a-da
