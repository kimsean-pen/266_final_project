I could have beer for breakfast, my sanity for lunch
Tryin' to get over how bad I want you so much
Innocense for dinner, pour somethin' in my cup
Anything and everything just to fill me up
But nothing ever gets me high like this

I bit my poison and it's you
Nothing can kill me like you do
You're goin' straight to my heart
And I'm headin' straight for the edge
I bit my poison and it's you
I bit my poison and it's you

I can feel your whisper and layin' on the floor
I tried to stop, but I keep on comin' back for more
I'm a light wave and I know it
Cause after the first time I was fallin', fallin' down
But nothing ever gets me high like this

I bit my poison and it's you
Nothing can kill me like you do
You're goin' straight to my heart
And I'm headin' straight for the edge
I bit my poison and it's you
I bit my poison and it's you

Bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
Fallin' deep, I can sleep tonight
And you make me feel like I'm out of my mind
But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

Bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
Fallin' deep, I can sleep tonight
And you make me feel like I'm out of my mind
But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

I bit my poison and it's you
Nothing can kill me like you do
You're goin' straight to my heart
And I'm headin' straight for the edge
I bit my poison and it's you
I bit my poison and it's you
