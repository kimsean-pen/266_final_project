Don't you say a word to me
I don't wanna hear it
You say you miss me
I don't wanna feel it, I don't wanna feel it
If you really wanted to be
Oh, if you really wanted to be here
You would make a woman out of me
Oh, I'll be the one that you believe in

You don't want my love I swear you don't want it
You don't want my trust I swear you don't want it
Gave you my all for what? I swear you don't want it
You don't want it bad enough, I'ma take it back

I don't want your pieces
Oh no no no no
I don't want your pieces
Oh no no no no

If you can't give me all your love
I don't want your love
It's like you threw a curve at me
Can't you see I'm hurting
Ooh, it's gonna be hard for me
I know that's where your heart been,
That I'm where your heart went, tryna let go of you
But I don't really know if I can do it
Close the door on you
You don't really wanna see me do it, no

I tried a thousand times
Told my heart a thousand lies
You won't let me say goodbye
You don't wanna see me do it, no

I don't want your pieces
Oh no no no no
I don't want your pieces
Oh no no no no

If you can't give me all your love
I don't want your love no no

If you can't give me all your love
I don't want your love no no, no

No baby, it's so clear
You leave me here
Wondering, dreaming, still believing
What you say but I'm not for it baby
I don't know who you think you're playing
Boy you know I'm the only one you're needing
Truth of the matter is you don't think I really have the strength to leave

But I don't want no pieces
Oh no no no no
I don't want your pieces
I'm tired of giving all of my love
I don't want your pieces
Oh no no no no
I don't want your pieces
Oh no no no no

I deserve more than just a little part
I don't want nothing, if I can't have it all
I ain't even gonna play with something I can't keep
I want the whole thing or forget about me
