I never came here for your heart
I only cave in to the bottle
You never showed me who you are
You never took me to the bottom
Sell it away from every angle
We're killing ourselves from all directions
Fade into the glow
Fame is all we need

Say it is the reason, I don't need it.
I don't need to be safe.
Singing isn't honest, I don't mean it.
I don't mean to be brave
Either way you are a ghost
Either way you are a ghost

All I know it's better where you are
I never wanted to see it
All I know it's better where you are
I never wanted to see it

You never gave in to my art
You never favored my vibrato.
You'll never turn me to a star,
I'll never take you to the bottom.
Sell it away from every angle
We're killing ourselves for the wrong intentions
Fade into the glow
Fame is all we need
Facing the unknown, vain and swayed by greed

Say it is the reason, I don't need it.
I don't need to be safe.
Singing isn't honest, I don't mean it.
I don't mean to be brave.
Either way you are a ghost
Either way you are a ghost
