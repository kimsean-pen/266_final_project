6: 05, outside the stadium
Special delivery for Hoops McCann
Brut and charisma poured from the shadow where he stood
Looking good, he's a crowd-pleasing man

One on one, he's schoolyard Superman
Crashing the backboard, he's Jungle Jim again
When it's all over
We'll make some calls from my car
We're a star

(It's a glamour profession
The L.A. concession)
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys

All aboard the Carib Cannibal
Off to Barbados just for the ride
Jack, with his radar, stalking the dread moray eel
At the wheel with his Eurasian bride

On the town, we dress for action
Celluloid bikers is Friday's theme
I drove the Chrysler
Watched from the darkness while they danced
I'm the one

(It's a glamour profession) I'm the one
(The L.A. concession)
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys

(Hollywood, I know your middle name
Who inspires your fabled fools?)
That's my claim to fame

Jive Miguel, he's in from Bogota
Meet me at midnight at Mr. Chow's
Szechuan dumplings
Now that the deal has been done
I'm the one

(It's a glamour profession) I'm the one
(The L.A. concession)
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
