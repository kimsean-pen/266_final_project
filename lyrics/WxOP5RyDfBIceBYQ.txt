You're the infection, my friend
Disgusting right to the end
Didn't I know it then?
I knew it, I knew it
You're basic but hard to define
Simple yet somehow sublime
Knew you would strike again
I knew it, I knew it

You're all that's wrong
With your dumbass psalms
Yet that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do
'Cause that's all that you will ever be

Polished, you shimmer when shined
But rotten and seething inside
Everyone falls for this
I knew it, I knew it

You're all that's wrong
With your dumbass psalms
Yet that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do
'Cause that's all that you will...
That's all that you will...
That's all that you will ever be

Ever be, never be, want to be God
All to be, made to be, holding the sign
Throwing it, breaking it, over your grave
Sending you back to the place you once came
It must be hard to be you
Nothing's alright with you

You're all that's wrong
With your dumbass psalms
Yet that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do
'Cause that's all that you will ever be

You will never be
You will never be
You will never be
You wanna be God
You wanna be God
You wanna be God
It's all God
It's all God
It's all God
It's all gone
It's all gone
