Just close your eyes
Imagine who you want to be
Just realise
All you got to do is dream

Take my hand
And sail to the end
With hopes and dreams and smile

I'll do it my way
We can do it all for love
Together
Deep down inside
We all just want to be free

I'll do it my way
This is where I want to be
Forever
Leave sparkle behind everywhere
Where you go

Just clear your mind
Download every good you see
Infinity
Freedom comes to brave
You'll see

Take my hand
And sail to the end
With hopes and dreams and smile

I'll do it my way
We can do it all for love
Together
Deep down inside
We all just want to be free

I'll do it my way
This is where I want to be
Forever
Leave sparkle behind everywhere
Where you go
