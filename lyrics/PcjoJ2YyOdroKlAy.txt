I believe
Nothin' ever comes to light
Chasin' shadows in the night
In a starless sky
And I wonder why?

Oh, I believe
We will never find a way
The darkness lights the day
We never question why
Still I wonder why?

I close my eyes lost in the memory
Just like a candle in the wind
What could have been
With just one kiss goodbye
You spread your wings to fly
Far away
Somehow, someday
You will understand
I hope you'll understand
Someday

Silent pictures like ghosts in the machine
Haunting my reflection in the frame
Chasin' down the hopeful child inside of me
Where'd it all go wrong and who's to blame

U-uh, we pass the time away
With empty lives the laughter dies

O-o-oh!
Is this all we have to show?
Is this all they'll ever know?
Can they find their way?
What went wrong?
Where have all the heroes gone?
Trading futures for a song
We gave away

Thinking only of myself I forged ahead
No regrets, no apologies
Bitter tears reward the life that I have led
A world of lies brings me to my knees

I took the road with every twist and every turn
The words of wisdom is the lesson never learned
Lose your fear and free your soul
Or the mysteries of life you'll truly never know
You'll never know!

Is this all we have to show?
Is this all they'll ever know?
Can they find their way?
What went wrong?
Where have all the heroes gone?
Trading futures for a song
We gave away
Just gave away

I close my eyes lost in the memory
Like a candle in the wind
What could have been
With just one kiss goodbye
You spread your wings to fly far away
I hope you'll understand one day

We pass the time away
With empty lives the laughter dies
And the colors fade
Fade away
Oh, daylight fades away
O-o-oh

O-o-oh!
Is this all we have to show?
Is this all they'll ever know?
Can they find their way?
What went wrong?
Where have all the heroes gone?
Trading futures for a song
We gave away

What went wrong?
Where have all the heroes gone?
Trading futures for a song
We gave away
