They're walking around head full of sound
Acting like we don't exist
They walk in a room stare right through you
Talking like we don't exist

But we exist
Daddy it's true, I'm different from you
But tell me why they treat me like this?
If you turned away, what would I say

Not the first betrayed by a kiss

Maybe it's true
They're staring at you
When you walk in a room

Tell them it's fine
Stare if you like
Just let us through

Just let us through
They're down on their knees Begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
Daddy it's fine, I'm used to them now
But tell me why they treat me like this?
It's cause we do it like this
Maybe it's true

They're staring at you
When you walk in a room
Tell them it's fine, stare if you like

Just let us through
Just let us through
Let them stare, let them stare!

If that's all they can do

But I'd lose my heart
If I turned away from you
Daddy don't turn away
You know that I'm so scared
But will you watch us drown?
You know we're going nowhere
We know we're young
And no shit we're confused
But will you watch us drown?
What are you so afraid to lose?
Down on your knees
Begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
Down on your knees
Begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
Down on your knees
Begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
We exist
We exist
We exist
We exist
