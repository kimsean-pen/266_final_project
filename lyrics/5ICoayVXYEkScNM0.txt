If you wanna make love to me
If you want to make me your own
And if you want to make me your slave
That's alright with me
(that's alright boy
that's alright)
If I must work both day and night
If I must supply your every need
And if I only get to see you once in a day
Hey, baby, that's alright with me
That's alright boy
That's alright
That's alright with me
I'll keep you happy all the days of my life
I'll even do wrong for you
I want the whole wide world to know
That I love you
I love you so
And if you need me to call you on the phone
(if you need to)
If you need someone to hold your hand
And if you need someone to be your own
Hey, baby, that's alright with me
That's alright with me
That's alright, quite alright, ooh-hoo-hoo...
