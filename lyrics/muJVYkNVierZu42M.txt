I've gotten far
It's no wonder we're apart
And what's it if you're not happy anymore
But on my side it
Isn't like that
I find myself alive in you now
Come and see me
My heart's beating
Come and save me
My heart's waiting for you,
For you

We're doing fine
Let's not leave it all behind
You're in my heart no matter where we are

But on my side
It isn't like that
I find myself alive in you now
Come and see me
My heart's beating
Come and save me
My heart's waiting for you

Come and see me
My heart's beating
Come and save me
My heart's waiting
Come and see me
My heart's beating
Come and save me my heart's waiting for you, for you
