Downwards, downwards
Life's spiraling descent
Downwards, downwards
Life's spiraling descent

All love is lost
Premature and unreasoning
Premature and unreasoning

Perversely chained without any values
Perversely chained without any values

Wretched, degraded
Wretched, degraded
Take it all on the chin
To forever hold my peace
To forever hold my peace

The reins turned noose, pull taunt as I fall
The reins turned noose, pull taunt as I fall

The figment is more painful than fact
And I'm the one to hang
Just for being me, for being me

The murky clouds wash, solace comforts not
And I'm the one to hang
Just for being me, just for being me

Black numbing blanket smothers attrition
Once and for all
