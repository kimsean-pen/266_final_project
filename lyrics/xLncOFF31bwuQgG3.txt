You stand so still hiding on the corner
Waiting fot the sign to, I come
I know your type, yeah, you're all the same
But who I am to blame when I fall deep?

In the beginning you intrigue
But the way you move
It terrefies me
And you remind me of the things that I don't need

You're a hothouse flower
Something I can not handle
You
You can't handle you
Can't handle you

I take one step then I take one backwards
I'm kinda curious, oh no, you got me already

In the beginning you succeed
But the way you move
It terrefies me
And you remind me of the things that I don't need

You're a hothouse flower
Something I can not handle
You
You can't handle you

And I don't need your hands
I don't need your shadow
And I don't need your hands
Or your shadow

You're a hothouse flower
Something I can not handle
You
You can't handle

You're a hothouse flower
Something I can not handle
You
You can't handle you
