Don't you ever try to love
You know nothing about me what you thinking of
Don't you ever try to heal
Cut me deep inside and leave me on my knee

And don't you ever ask for trust
Giving you my all was always murderous
Don't you ever try to feel
Affection is a virtue you will not reveal

Because you did it
Oh you went and did it again
You won't admit it
Oh you think that love is a sin
How are you with it
Oh how are you with it
Why oh why
Well have you ever heard a heart cry

Have you every heard a heart cry
Oh Oh
Have you ever heard a heart

Don't you ever ask for time
You will be accounted for your heartless crime
Don't you ever want for lust
Passion is a game you play so dangerous

And don't you ever take my hand
Intentions don't make you a better man
Don't you ever take me home
Love was just evicted and it's long gone

Because you did it
Oh you went and did it again
You won't admit it
Oh you think that love is a sin
How are you with it
Oh how are you with it
Why oh why
Well have you ever heard a heart cry

Have you ever heard a heart cry
Oh oh
Have you ever heard a heart

Why is the love gone
Tell me why is the love gone
Maybe you need my heart to save
Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-why why is the love gone
How did it all go wrong
Maybe you need my heart to save

Have you ever heard a heart cry (cry)
Have you ever heard a heart cry cry
Have you ever heard a heart cry (cry cry)
Have you ever heard a heart cry
Have you ever
Have you ever heard a heart cry

Don't you ever try to love
You know nothing what you think you know
Don't you ever try to heal?
Cut me deep inside and leave me on my knee
