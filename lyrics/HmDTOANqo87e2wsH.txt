We hold in our hearts
the sword and the faith
Swelled up from the rain clouds
Move like a wraith
Well after all, we'll lie another day
And through it all, we'll find some other way
To carry on through cartilage and fluid
And did you come to stare or wash away the blood?

Well tonight, well tonight will it ever come?
Spend the rest of your days rockin' out
Just for the dead
Well tonight, will it ever come?
I can see you awake anytime in my head

Did we all fall down?
Did we all fall down?
Did we all fall down?
Did we all fall down?
From the lights to the pavement
From the van to the floor
From backstage to the doctor
From the earth to the morgue
Morgue, morgue, morgue!

Well tonight, will it ever come?
Spend the rest of your days rockin' out just for the dead
Well tonight, will it ever come?
I can see you awake anytime in my head
All fall down, well after all...
