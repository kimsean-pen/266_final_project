We began as the Earthwalkers shaping a dream.
We were the bright sparks of a new born flame.
Born among seven billion we were the hope interwoven in the web of life.
Power always moves in circles, infinite beyond all sense of time.
This is the force that binds.
Earthwalkers we journey on.
We give everything, everything just to feel alive.
We're following the signs that light the way.
We keep dreaming, this feeling there's no need to hide.
We just keep following the signs.
Now with one dream and many years on, we are the embers that never fade away.
Power always moves in circles.
Fathomless, passionate, won't you dream with us now?
Earthwalkers we journey on.
We give everything, everything just to feel alive.
We're following the signs that light the way.
We keep dreaming, this feeling there's no need to hide.
We just keep following the signs.
Here we are counting the years, as they go past it becomes even more clear:
that with the life of a fountain and the strength of a mountain,
Earthwalkers will never die.
Light the way.
We keep dreaming, this feeling there's no need to hide.
We just keep following the signs.
We give everything, everything just to feel alive.
We're following the signs that light the way.
We keep dreaming, this feeling there's no need to hide.
We just keep following the signs.
