I haven't gotten anywhere
But I've been busy trying
Taken steps like little mice
With the heart of a lion

The songs that we sing
They turned our arms into wings
We'll meet again
In this golden circle we're in

We've been leaving little marks
We've been building fires
We've been burning our guitars
From the top of the pier

The songs that we sing
They turned our arms into wings
We'll meet again
In this golden circle we're in

The songs that we've sang
They turned our arms into wings
We'll meet again
In this golden circle we're in

And the road twists and turns
Call it a home, make a friend
And every town
Set a house and burn it down
We will spend the coming night
Under the stars
In castles we dreamed of

The songs that we've sang
They turned our arms into wings
We'll meet again
In this golden circle we're in

The songs that we've sang
They turned our arms into wings
We'll meet again
In this golden circle we're in
