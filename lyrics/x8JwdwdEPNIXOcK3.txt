Oh oh
Sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
(Yeah)
I get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no, no
(Yeah)
I just wanna tell you right now that I
(Ooohh)
I believe
I really do believe that

Something's got a hold on me, yeah
(Oh, it must be love)
Ooh, something's got a hold on me right now, child
(Oh, it must be love)

Let me tell you now
I got a feeling, I feel so strange
Everything about me seems to have changed
Step by step, I got a brand new walk
I even sound sweeter when I talk

I said,
Oh, (oh)
Oh, (oh)
Oh, (oh)
Oh! (oh)
Ey, hey, yeah
Oh, it must be love
(You know it must be love)

Let me tell you now
Something's got a hold on me, yeah
(Oh, it must be love)
Ooh, something's got a hold on me right now, child
(Oh, it must be love)

Let me tell you now
I've never felt like this before
Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
Believe I'd die if I only could
I feel so strange, but it sure is good

I said,
Oh, (oh)
Oh, (oh)
Oh, (oh)
Oh! (oh)
Ey, hey, yeah
Oh, it must be love
(You know it must be love)

Let me tell you now
My heart feels heavy
My feet feel light
I shake all over
I feel alright
I never felt like this before

Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
I never thought it could happen to me
Got me heavy without the misery
I never thought it could be this way
But love's sure gonna put a hurting on me

I said,
Oh, (oh)
Oh, (oh)
Oh, (oh)
Oh! (oh)
Ey, hey, yeah
Oh, it must be love
(You know it must be love)

Oh
You know, it walks like love
(You know, it walks like love)
It talk like love
(You know, it talks like love)
Make me feel alright
(Make me feel alright)
In the middle of the night
(In the middle of the night)

La, la, la, la
(La, la, la, la)
La, la, la, la
(La, la, la, la)
