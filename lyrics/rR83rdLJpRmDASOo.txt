Play until my fingers hurt
Write until I find the words
(Ohh ohh)
So much that I wanna say
Before the moment slips away
(Ohh ohh)
So hard to find this place
So hard to catch this chase
Now that you fell into me
Hit me like a melody
(Ohh ohh)

Everybody says that nothing ever lasts forever
So I'm hanging on tight trying to keep it all tied together

Everybody says that nothing ever lasts forever
So I'm hanging on tight trying to keep it all tied together
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
And on and on
And on and on
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
And on and on
And on and on
How do we make this heart beat on and on?

Hold me like a photograph
Fragile like a piece of glass
(Ohh ohh)
The future's headed for the past
Full of sparks that couldn't last
(Ohh ohh)
So hard to find this place
So hard to catch that flame
Now that you fell into me
Hit me like a melody
(Ohh ohh)

Everybody says that nothing ever lasts forever
So I'm hanging on tight trying to keep it all tied together
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
And on and on
And on and on
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
And on and on
And on and on
How do we make this heart beat on and on?

How do we make this heart beat on and on?

How do we make this heart beat on and on?

Everybody says that nothing ever lasts forever
So I'm hanging on tight trying to keep it all tied together
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
And on and on
And on and on
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
And on and on
And on and on
How do we make this heart beat (heart beat)

Everybody says that nothing ever lasts forever
So I'm hanging on tight trying to keep it all tied together
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
And on and on
And on and on
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
And on and on
And on and on
How do we make this heart beat on and on?

How do we make this heart beat on and on?

How do we make this heart beat on and on?

Play until my fingers hurt
Write until I find the words
(Ohh ohh)
