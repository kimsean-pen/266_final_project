You hide behind barricades
Built of facades, you think you're safe
But someday we all will find you
Come to where you work, and fucking tie you

Every lie
Shoved back
Down your throat
By our hands
A skull fuck
For every word
Just try to breathe
Don't fuck with this

Break every bone in your face
If you mess with my life
I'll mess with your blood
Bury you in a coffin made of your
A coffin made of your deceptions

Obsess as each second fades
In denial of your mind made
Still your jealousy precedes you
You're really in love with all that I do

Every lie
Shoved back
Down your throat
By our hands
A skull fuck
For every word
Just try to breathe
Don't fuck with this

Break every bone in your face
If you mess with my life
I'll mess with your blood
Bury you in a coffin made of your
A coffin made of your deceptions

This is to the rats
This is to the rats

This is to the rats
This is to the rats

And your conscience still tears at you
You secretly want to be just like me

A skull fuck
For every word
Just try to breathe
Don't fuck with this

Break every bone in your face
If you mess with my life
I'll mess with your blood
Bury you in a coffin made of your
A coffin made of your deceptions

Break every bone in your face
If you mess with my life
I'll mess with your blood
Bury you in a coffin made of your
A coffin made of your deceptions
