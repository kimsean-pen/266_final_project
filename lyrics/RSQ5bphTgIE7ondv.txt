Hey, baby, whew!

I know that you believe in me,
Thats all I ever need, uh huh.
No, no, nothings gonna stop me,
Nothing will be scaring me, oh no

Hey baby, its the only way out
Oh, little darling,
Cmon whats it all about?

(Chorus #1)
Standing on top of the world
For a little while.
Standing on top of the world
Gonna give it all we got.

Oh, I know know you wanna touch,
I gotta have a little taste
I just wanna sink my teeth in that
Fine piece of real estate, yeah

Hey baby, make it nice and sweet,
Oh, little darling
Let's take a walk down easy street

(Chorus #2)
Standing on top of the world,
For a little while.
Standing on top of the world
Lets give it all we got

Oooh oooh
Baby, gotta feeling, oooh oooh,
Oh, I wanna touch it, now, oooh oooh oooh,
See the whole wide world turn upside down.

(Guitar Intermission)

Hey, baby, whew!
Someday, we'll be

(Chorus #3)
Standing on top of the world
For a little while
Standing on top of the world
Till we got stung.
Standing on top of the world
For a little while.
Standing on top of the world
Gonna give it all we got.
(standing on top) hey, baby.
(standing on top) hey darling
Standing on top,
Standing on top,
Standing on top
