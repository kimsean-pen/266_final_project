Isn't it strange, impossible to claim your reward
I cannot explain, emotions I can barely afford to contain
You're the same, you hide away from anything that turns you on
Nobody gets what they want anymore

No words only scream,
could possibly protect you, you know what it means
Two is the charm, a place therein around us and pray and pray
And saying the name there is no
blame, there is no shame, and even more
Nobody gets what they want anymore
Nobody gets what they want anymore

Again, again
I know the shame I've waste it all on someone else's time
Nobody gets what they want anymore
Nobody gets what they want anymore
Nobody gets what they want anymore
Nobody gets what they want anymore

What am I going to do when you're in trouble
And you don't call out for me
What am I going to do when I can see that you've been crying
And you don't want no help from me
Baby I can't separate us out anymore
Baby I can't separate us out anymore
