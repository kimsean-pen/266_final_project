I am on the very first week away from you
Not a lot to say or do
I see you in the places
Where I once held your skin
There's nowhere I can go
Where we haven't been

In the middle of a heartbreak song that I'm writing for you
I find words to escape with all the courage I grew
But I feel you pulling and my spirit breaks again
I'll be whole
But I don't know when

I'll be whole, I'll be whole
But I don't know when
I'll be whole, I'll be whole
But I don't know when

It's easy to compress our time into only good
And looking back it's easy to think that nothing ever
Really went wrong
And I remember heartache
And it helps me understand
Trying to find comfort anyway I can

In the middle of a heartbreak song that I'm writing for you
I find words to escape with all the courage I grew
But I feel you pulling and my spirit breaks again
I'll be whole
But I don't know when

I'll be whole, I'll be whole
But I don't know when
I'll be whole, I'll be whole
But I don't know when

And as I lie here in pieces
Breaking was just what I needed
I knew we had to end
I'll be whole, I'll be whole
But I don't know when
The more that I think about it
I was better off without it
But now I have to mend
I'll be whole, I'll be whole
But I don't know when

Oh, oh, oh, ohh
I'll be whole, I'll be whole
But I don't know when
Oh, oh, oh, ohh

In the middle of a heartbreak song that I'm writing for you
I find words to escape with all the courage I grew
But I feel you pulling and my spirit breaks again
I'll be whole
But I don't know when

But I don't know when
