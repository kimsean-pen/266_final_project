Imagine a future and be in it
Feel this incredible nurture, soak it in
Your past is a loop
Turn it off

See this possible future and be in it
Hold fort for love, forever
We're just momentary vessels
We're just carrying
Trust your head around
Guide your sense where
Your love is already waiting
You're already in it

Hold fort forever, forever
Watch me form new nests
Weave a matriarchial dome
Build a musical scaffolding
Between sleep and awake
Day and night
(Between day and night)

You see a mirror, peoples missions at them
Now you mirror at me
who I used to be
What I gave to the world
You've given back at me
Hold fort for love
Forever
