It's like second-hand smoke in your lungs
You cough, you cough you cough, but it's- okay
It's a phase they say
Breathing is just temporary medicine
Nothing seems to matter
When no one needs noticing
The missteps, the smoke breaks
It's all in your head they say

Try to smooth it out

Scan an open road, distort the traffic
Never getting used to these second guesses
I can't pretend these things never happened
In every silence, there is a static
There is a static

So I'll try to smooth it out
It's whatever
Let me be the wind on your shoulders
I'll try to smooth it out
I will starve myself
I will do anything

I will starve myself
I will do anything
I will starve myself
I will do anything
To help

Scan an open road, distort the traffic
Never getting used to these second guesses
I can't pretend these things never happened
In every silence, there is a static

Scan an open road, distort the traffic
Never getting used to these second guesses
I can't pretend these things never happened
(its all in your head)
In every silence, there is a static

It's like second-hand smoke
It's like second-hand smoke
Inside your head
