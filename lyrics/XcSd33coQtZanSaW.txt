I'm a river, I keep running on
I'm a pillar you got used to leaning on
Underneath it, there's a person
I'm a woman and I'm hurting
'Cause I feel like I'm holding up the world

When I lay this burden down
Who's gonna take it up for me
When you run me in the ground
That's the day you're gonna see
For all I've done I'm alone
Just for a moment can I not be strong?
So how 'bout now, oh can I lay
This burden down?

I deliver each and every time
I'm a giver, I don't think about what's mine
You keep asking, you keep taking
And that's no reciprocation
I shouldn't have to do this by myself

When I lay this burden down
Who's gonna take it up for me
When you run me in the ground
That's the day you will see
For all I've done I'm alone
Just for a moment, could I not be strong?
How 'bout now, can I lay
This burden down?

I'm a river, I keep running on
I'm a pillar, you're used to leaning on
Just this once, oh
Ooh just this once

Can I lay this burden down?
Can you take it up for me?
When you run, when you run me in the ground
That's the day you're gon see
Now all I've done, I'm alone
Just for a moment could I not be strong?
Wish I knew how, I'd lay this burden down
