Why did you choose to stay?
Are you sure about your life for once?
Have you fell? How are you gonna live?
I can tell you that you've gotten far

Why did you want to come back to me?
Was it cause I didn't want to leave?
I want you to know I'll keep you out of harm
but you got to know you left your mark... on me

Why did you choose to stay?
Are you sure about your life for once?
Are you finally going to live?
I can tell you how I've gotten far.

Why did you want to come back to me?
Was it cause I didn't want to leave?
I want you to know I'll keep you out of harm
but you got to know you left your mark
