I'm not sure where I've landed, so far from home
Sandcastle limbs are broken, so far from home
I'm unrewound and rented, so far from home
There's new knuckles on my hand
And no one home

Rake me in. Rinse me out
Sour sad
No one's home

I'm not sure where I left it, so far from home
See past those lips and answers, so far from whole
Deep gasp for air I'm choking, so far from home
A list of dumb demands
There's no one home

It's a town of broken homes
It's a time of broken hope

You left us in the dark

Breathe
Just a little file right to the bone
No one's home

Breathe
Where's that little fire?
Gone
