No, it's not what we meant to say
We don't really love each other
What happens when the summers over
and the far distance becomes a chore
I'm approaching with great trepidation
I hope you'll understand

Four years speak about what you're trying to say
The wealth is there to blame for miscommunication
You're getting caught up in the excitement
Youre making promises you can't keep
You need to leave all of your options open

Too much momentum
This room feels like it's gonna explode
Too many angles, too many factors to cover
Waiting for signal, youre searching for a network
You have to fight to stay in control of the situation

Anxiety-- give me no mercy
Grind my teeth smooth and flat in my sleep
Took some pills to calm us down
We needed help to come back up
Just trying to stay in control of the situation

Too much momentum
This room feels like it's gonna explode
Too many angles, too many factors to cover
Waiting for signal, youre searching for a network
You have to fight to stay in control of the situation

Fall apart so easily

Too much momentum
This room feels like it's gonna explode
Too many angles, too many factors to cover
Waiting for signal, youre searching for a network
You have to fight to stay in control of the situation
(Man you don't have to fight to stay in control of the situation)
