Turn the page and start to write
The world won't wait for procrastination
You'll never bleed if you never fight
But how much pain is worth the elation?
Part the sea and release the skies
The future's brighter than you'll ever know

If you ever frame your mind and see it all in another light
If you ever frame your mind and see it all in another light
If you ever frame your mind and see it all in another light
If you ever frame your mind and see it all in another light

Follow through in the face of ire
Turn away from feigned admiration
Define the rules by a state of mind
Don't give in to cheap imitation
Change the scene to a better line
We need it more than you'll ever know

If you ever frame your mind and see it all in another light
If you ever frame your mind and see it all in another light
If you ever frame your mind and see it all in another light
If you ever frame your mind and see it all in another light
