I dreamed that you've died
I'm forever alone
I'm weak and I'm frightened
This brings about to change
Things you said to me
Believe and the things you might find
Will turn into a march

I stand alone and breathe again
I won't stop until this is through

And I can't wait to see the sun rise again
It's moments like this
I am what you'll never be to better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

Feel a sudden haze
Time to get moving
Getting somewhere with no directions
I swear to you it will never be the same
It's not straight but the road lies open
Leaving all tears behind

I stand alone and breathe again
I won't stop until this is through

And I can't wait to see the sun rise again
It's moments like this
I am what you'll never be to better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

I can't wait to see the sun rise again
It's moments like this
I am what you'll never be to better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

Erase darkness from my mind
Last remaining night
From here to everywhere

I stand alone and breathe again
I won't stop until this is through

And I can't wait to see the sun rise again
It's moments like this
I am what you'll never be to better what I am
You won't hear lies from me
And I can't wait to see the sun rise again
I am what you'll never be to better what I am
You won't hear lies from me
