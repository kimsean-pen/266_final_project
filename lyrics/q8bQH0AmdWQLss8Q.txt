There's a stillness in time
Which I cannot define
Does your heart bleed like mine all the time yeah
For a place we can go
Where the troubles of our time are far away
Hey they are so far away
And I had all my life in front of me
Now my darkness days are trouble free
There are so many wonderous things for you to see

If you find that somethings going wrong
Look around at what your running from
You can wait a thousand years in line
For that stillness in time

I found love in that way
And I'm never sad, and I'm always glad
Anything you give me today
Oh yeah I will will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
Cause they don't know where they're coming from
Ooh there was nothing left to do but hang on
For that stillness in time

There's a stillness in time
Search the space inside my mind

If this world is turning too fast for your head
Just remember how bad times can roll instead
Guess I'll have to search the space in my mind
For that stillness in time

Oh yeah I found love in that way
And I'm never sad, and I'm always glad
Ooh yeah anything you give me today
Oh yeah I will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
Cause they don't know where they're coming from
Hey, there was nothing left to do but hang on
For that stillness in time

I know that this is the peripheral side of bliss
There is no me, for the love I have will stay the same
I have been wrong if I don't know where I'm coming from
If I don't see the things that are inside of me
Apart of me, in front of me
Oh, see it's all around me
Said I know, said I want to find that stillness in time
Stillness in time

Hey
