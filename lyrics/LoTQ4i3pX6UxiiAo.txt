I don't know who to trust
No surprise
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies

Trying not to break
But I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself
Get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this
All the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you
Just takes so much out of me

Take everything from the inside and throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

Tension is building inside
Steadily
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me

Trying not to break
But I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself
Get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this
All the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you
Just takes so much out of me

Take everything from the inside and throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
I won't waste myself on you
You
You
Waste myself on you
You
You

I take everything from the inside and throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

Everything from the inside and just throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
You
You
