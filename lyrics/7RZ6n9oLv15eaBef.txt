Was only just the other day
And all this felt so real
Like nothing could go wrong
Was like a never ending dream
Nothing ever changed
For so long

But now you've gone away
And I've tried turning the page
And it's just not the same

But I'm breathing in
And I'm breathing out
I'm wide awake
But I can't hear a sound
Though I'm breathing in
I can't think about
Another you, another me, another now

Where do I go from here?
I've never felt so strange
I've never felt so torn
'Cause ever since you came my way
I learned to live by you
And now I'm on my own

I know I need some time
To leave all of this behind
'Cause I'm still hanging on

But I'm breathing in
And I'm breathing out
I'm wide awake
But I can't hear a sound
Though I'm breathing in
I can't think about
Another you, another me, another now

I'm sitting here, I'm all alone
Don't wanna to move, nowhere to go
'Cause nothing's real, I just wanna hide
'Cause you're not here

But I'm breathing in
And I'm breathing out
I'm wide awake
But I can't hear a sound

I'm breathing in
And I'm breathing out
I'm wide awake
But I can't hear a sound
Though I'm breathing in
I can't think about
Another you, another me, another now

Another you, another me, another now
