The death of the party
Came as no surprise
Why did we bother
should have stayed away

Another night
And I thought well well
Go to another party
And hang myself
Gently on the shelf

The death of the teenager
standing on his own
why did he bother
should have slept alone

Another night
And I thought well well
Go to another party
And hang myself
Gently on the shelf

(Repeat)
