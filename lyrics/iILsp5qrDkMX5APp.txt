I can hear what you're thinkin'
All your doubts and fears
And if you look in my eyes
In time you'll find the reason I'm here

And in time all things shall pass away
In time you may come back some day
To live once more or die once more
But in time your time will be no more

You know your days are numbered
Count um one bye one
Like notches in the handle of an outlaws gun
You can out run the devil if you try
But you can never out run the hands of time
In time there'll surely come a day

In time all things shall pass away
In time you may come back some say
To live once more or die once more
But in time your time will be no more
I can hear what you're thinkin'
