Storm rolled in
To our surprise
It doesn't rain under the tall trees
You were my lover
You were my tree
You would always protect me
It's easier
To take a heart
Than let your own be taken
I love that little smile you keep
In the corner of your mouth

And is it hard to see me go?
Doing things the wrong way
If you're here, when I fall
I know that I won't fall, a long way
A long way

We were talking on the phone
I stepped out into the hallway
My face was frozen on the screen
And you started laughing
Put a comb through your hair
And a clean shirt on
There's people coming 'round here soon
Everyone, act normal

And big trees fall all the time
They crack and sound like lightning
Leave a big space in your sky when they fall
When they fall, a long way
A long way

Pick me up
Fill my cup now
Take me down
Down to where we start
Let's go too far now
All tangled up
Take me down
Down to where we start
Down to where we start
Where we start
