You can't hold it too tight
These matters of security
You don't have to be wound so tight
Smoking on the balcony

But it's like sleaze in the park
You women, you have no self-control
The angels remark outside
You are known for insatiable needs
I don't know a thing

I've seen love
And I follow the speeding of starlight
I've seen love
And I follow the speeding of starswept night

Yeah, pace is the trick
And to all the destruction in man

Well I see you as you take your pride
My lioness
Your defenses seem wise
I can not press
And detentions are demised
My lioness
Can't you hurt it some?
Think I hurt it

I've seen love
And I follow the speeding of starlight
I've seen love
And I follow the speeding of starswept night

And now I select you
Slow down I let you
See how I stun
See how I stun

And now I select you
Slow down I beg you
See how I stun
See how I stun

And to all the destruction in man
And to all the corruption in my hand

And now I select you
Slow down I let you
See how I stun
See how I stun

And now I select you
Slow down I beg you
See how I stun
See how I stun
And now I select you (I've seen love)
Slow down I let you
See how I stun
See how I stun
And now I select you (I've seen love)
Slow down I beg you
I always follow the speeding of starswept night
You don't hold a candle
You don't hold a candle
You don't hold a candle
