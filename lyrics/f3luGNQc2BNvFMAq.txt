Well, you had all my love
In the palm of your hand
But that wasn't enough
And I don't understand why
I gave you all my time,
Now it's yours; isn't mine, no
'Cause you stole all the
Love from the palm of my hand

I thought time and some space
Might just heal all this pain
But I know that it's hopeless, yeah

How can I love when
My heart's half gone?
There's not enough
Left for me to move on
Yeah, you took every piece
But the one that
I needed was you all along
How can I love
When my heart's half gone?

Lost my head off my shoulders,
No, I wasn't thinking straight
And the more I got to know you,
The more you would get from me
How could I be so blind?
Captivated by those eyes
I lost my head off my
Shoulders, no,
I wasn't thinking straight

How can I love
When my heart's half gone?
There's not enough
Left for me to move on
Yeah, you took every piece
But the one that
I needed was you all along
How can I love
When my heart's half gone?
How can I love
When my heart's half gone?

I thought time and some space
Might just heal all this pain
But I know that it's hopeless, yeah
I thought time and some space
Might just heal all this pain
But I know that it's hopeless, yeah

How can I love when
My heart's half gone?
There's not enough
Left for me to move on
Yeah, you took every piece
But the one that
I needed was you all along
How can I love
When my heart's half gone?

(How can I love? Yeah, yeah)
How can I love? Yeah
(When my heart is half gone)
Oh, my heart is half gone
(How can I love? Yeah, yeah)
Oh, you took every piece
And the one that
I need is you all along
(When my heart is half gone)
How can I love when
My heart's half gone?
