Through the fall of creation
A death mask transforms the past
The contours of a labyrinth emerge

As dusk it clings to silent stone
Dead to all future generations

Let their strength now dissolve
The sun to me is dark forever
A nihilistic urge
As death thickens in their throats

Like fragments of silent fires
Like fragments of silent fires

The distorted hierarchies
Under boiling clouds
A cold stare, bound in stone
Behind the curtain of dust

As dusk it clings to silent stone
Immortalizing the suppression

Let their strength now dissolve
The sun to me is dark forever
A nihilistic urge
As death thickens in their throats

Featureless, elusive
Drowning in the silent black
Obsession like wildfire inhaled

Like fragments of silent fires
Like fragments of silent fires
Like fragments of silent fires
Like fragments of silent fires
Like fragments of silent fires
