There was a sports car on the road (on the road)
I thought I knew the fellow that drove
That little sports car was slippery as an oyster
Following it was like riding on a rollercoaster (rollercoaster)

Around the corners and over the bumps
Every minute, faster and faster, my heart thumped (my heart thumped)

Well, finally he stopped to get some gas
If I was to catch up I had to move fast (to move fast)
I stepped on the gas and just made the corner
Wow, I was almost a goner (goner)

When I got there he was gone
I don't know where I went wrong (I went wrong)
The time went fast, it was late
I knew I had no time to waste (time to waste)

I turned around and headed for home
I learned my lesson never to roam
I learned my lesson never to roam
Never to roam
Never to roam
Never to roam
Never to roam
