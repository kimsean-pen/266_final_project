I've been roamin' and strollin' all of these streets
Burnin' my eyes red, not slept for weeks
Tested with torment, my future is bleak
Lost in the moment with no words to speak

I can't find no peace
(I can't find no peace)

Am I a fool? (Fool)
Waitin' for you (You)
What if you never come back? (What if you never come back?)
What if you never come back? (What if you never come back?)
There's nothin' new (New)
I made another hit
I made another two
What if we never know
Why hearts deceive us
The night calls the dreamers

My sleep was stolen, I'm searching for thieves
These memories in my head are too vivid to see
I can't find no peace
(I can't find no peace)
And when I close my eyes I feel it all again
I can't find no peace

Am I a fool? (Fool)
Waitin' for you (You)
What if you never come back? (What if you never come back?)
What if you never come back? (What if you never come back?)
There's nothin' new (New)
I made another hit
I made another two
What if we never know
Why hearts deceive us
The night calls the dreamers

Insomnia
And when I close my eyes I feel it all again
Insomnia
And when I close my eyes I feel it all again

Am I a fool? (Fool)
Waitin' for you (You)
What if you never come back? (What if you never come back)
What if you never come back? (What if you never come back)
There's nothin' new (New)
I made another hit
I made another two
What if we never know
Why hearts deceive us?
The night calls the dreamers
