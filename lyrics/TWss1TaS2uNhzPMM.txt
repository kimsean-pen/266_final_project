Before I spoke a word
You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me

Before I took a breath
You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me

Oh the overwhelming, never-ending
Reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down
Fights 'til I'm found
Leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn't earn it and I don't deserve it
Still You give Yourself away
Oh the overwhelming, never-ending
Reckless love of God

When I was Your foe
Still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me

When I felt no worth
You paid it all for me
You have been so, so kind to me

Oh the overwhelming, never-ending
Reckless love of God
Oh it chases me down
Fights 'til I'm found
Leaves the ninety-nine

I couldn't earn it and I don't deserve it
Still You give yourself away
Oh the overwhelming, never-ending
Reckless love of God

There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me

There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
No wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me

There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
No wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me

There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
No wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me

Oh the overwhelming, never-ending
Reckless love of God
Oh it chases me down
Fights 'til I'm found
Leaves the ninety-nine

I couldn't earn it and I don't deserve it
Still You give Yourself away
Oh the overwhelming, never-ending
Reckless love of God
