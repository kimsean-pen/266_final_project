Boy and girl
Never ever getting old

Baby, I want to be real with you
Lock eyes and bring me back to life
Baby, you know how I feel with you
It's time to turn the clock around

One boy (one boy)
In the world
To be my boy
I'm your girl tonight
One boy (one boy)
In the world
To be my boy
I can be your girl

Ready?
