If often in the still of night
Thoughts turn out twisted
Well unwind

Uncurl and lay the worries of the world
By any fire you find
Dreamers only believers in their sleep
Under archievers take a leap
Tell her the secrets that you keep

So close and yet too far out
Maybe someday you'll hear
Sweet somethings whispered softly
Into your ear

To those with afflictions
Prone to addictions
To users and to losers
Doubters and their daughters and sons
Your Angel will come

Maybe she's come and gone
Already lost the one
What have you done
You lost the only one

If you came from something
And you're headed nowhere
Out on the run
Allow this thought to crystallise

It is better in the long run
To never get there
And let the journey decide

In all this doom and this gloom
And pessimistical visions
Came all condemned men
All fatalists in metaphysical fear
How could love be here

To those with afflictions
Prone to addictions
To users and losers
Doubters and their daughters and sons
Your Angel will come

And to those with intentions
In all three dimensions
To jokers and to the joke
Doubters and their daughters and sons
(maybe you've found the one)

Maybe she's come and gone
