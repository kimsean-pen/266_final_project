Yo, yo, yo
I got money, I got money (bitch)
I got money growing on trees
Diamonds for seeds, a million leaves
Cartier rings, on all of my fings'
Got that whip at the wings
When they see me, they see money
'Cause I got ka-ching
I got money, I got money (bitch)
I got money, got the Louis, that Prada, Vendi
The white gin is a G
You got the whip, I got me three
Yeah, I'm living the dream
When they see me, they see money
Cause I got ka-ching

I used to be a broke ass bitch
Yeah, I'm in school but no class bitch
Stop, don't even ask bitch
'Cause I ain't got no cash for no gas bitch
But that was a pass bitch
The glow up was fast bitch
I'm chilling, I'm past rich
I'm swimming in cash bitch
All my haters can drop in a casket
Fat money, tall money
Black money, raw money
Thick money, RuPaul money
Haters, where y'all money?
Who did Beyonce send fo'? Me
Who wrists' covered in gold? T
Who got T-Swift on they phone? He
A million a month on my own, shit

Yo, yo, yo
I got money, I got money (bitch)
I got money growing on trees
Diamonds for seeds, a million leaves
Cartier rings, on all of my fings'
Got that whip at the wings
When they see me, they see money
'Cause I got ka-ching
I got money, I got money (bitch)
I got money, got the Louis, that Prada, Vendi
The white gin is a G
You got the whip, I got me three
Yeah, I'm living the dream
When they see me, they see money
Cause I got ka-ching

I got a big (big) fat (fat) black (black)
card and I ain't afraid to use it (you know it)
And when I party,
I party hard 'cause I got moolah
and I ain't afraid to lose it, no, no
I spin that thing like it's a ballerina (ballerina)
Whatever side I'm on, the grass is greener (oh la la bitch)
I don't see these hoes, just call me Sia
I'm laughin' at these bums like a hyena (Ha ha)
They say they saw my face in Forbes, where was the lie though?
They say you can't buy happiness, I just said bye hoe, bye
So busy winning, I don't need to win the lotto
You smell that money, that's the lobbo in yo' nostril
They couldn't get up on my level if they dared
Pretending that they ballin' but they wallet is impaired
And I be shopping and dropping coins on them twins from D squared
Got so many zeroes that the ATM is scared, Ahh

I got money, I got money (bitch)
I got money growing on trees
Diamonds for seeds, a million leaves
Cartier rings, on all of my fings'
Got that whip at the wings
When they see me, they see money
'Cause I got ka-ching
I got money (eh), I got money (bitch)
I got money, got the Louis (got it), that Prada, Vendi
The white gin is a G
You got the whip, I got me three (three)
Yeah, I'm living the dream
When they see me (ow), they see money (yep)
Cause I got ka-ching
