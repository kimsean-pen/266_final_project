there's a shield around us
it's invisible & soundless.
& we drink too much & xxxx too soon
smoke cigarettes in rented rooms
we quit our jobs & shoot the moon
& cut our wrists & sleep til noon

there's a shield around us
we're invincible & boundless
& we're on the run from I don't know
we're Patty Hearst & Squeaky Fromme
asleep on subways far from home
you'd think we'd never seen a comb

sent a letter to Mom & Dad
Mom & Dad the money's running out
got a letter from Mom & Dad
they didn't send me anything

there's a shield around us
we are heady we are groundless
& we burn our friends & kill their names
build insecure & petty fames
& tattoo things that we believe
stars & skulls & hearts in half-sleeves

there's a shield around us
tell me how is it you've found us
cause we hide our tracks & watch the ground
our footfalls they don't make a sound
we've cursed the names of our hometowns
we're compassless & nowhere bound

sent a letter to Mom & Dad
Mom & Dad the money's running out
got a letter from Mom & Dad
I swear to God they don't get me at all
