Terrain disfigured
Pressure temple, tempt to tap trigger
Must contend with this diseased mind and drown liver
Cradle soul eternal type land of two rivers
Considered quite embittered by whole corrupt system
Bled fist in attempt when words weren't heard
Never one to feel blessed beliefs are all blurred
Breath in nocturne
Tone ever somber
Must be meant to wander
Woeful soul won't get conquered
Days none the calmer
No wealth to squander
My lower class stronger
Can't suppress anger
People can't handle
Speak Eastern timbre
Tongue fall like hammer
On those who slander.

Success lasts for seconds
Our future's forsaken
(never found reason)
Blatant lies of Bourgeois
(never found meaning)
Seeps into vacant
(Found hatred and despair in breathing)
Eyes out of focus
Only see what they told us
World of weight's on our shoulders

Asymmetric hatred only feeds apathetic
Volatile vocals turned thoughts kinetic
Never knew your happiness could just be injected
Belt to clenched jaw teeth hurt all infected
Childhood resurrected
With no mention
We never add time just subtract from life sentence
Why divide God in three sections?
Some find Him uncut in glass vile son, no difference
Frail existence, veiled world depicted
By those still addicted to deities received intravenous
Believers remove pure diction in attempts to deceive us
The last of tacticians
Acts of contrition lost in translation
People lose patience
With words that sound vacant
Atrocities blatant by hands of forsaken
The fortunate find core essence awakened.

Success lasts for seconds
Our future's forsaken
(never found reason)
Blatant lies of Bourgeois
(never found meaning)
Seeps into vacant
(Found hatred and despair in breathing)
Eyes out of focus
Only see what they told us
World of weight's on our shoulders
