She was way too fine for me
But of course i did approach
I thought id break the ice a bit
With maybe two or three notes
She was way too fly from me
So i tried to grow wings
Small laughs and paid compliments
Would maybe stretch out some things

She was amorous
I tried to give her the more of me
More than gorgeous
More than i have ever seen
She was amorous
I tried to give her the more of me
But she was way too much
More than i have ever seen

She was way too fine for me
But of course i did approach
I thought id ask her out tonight
And maybe she'd say yes and go
She was way too fly for me
So we ate on the top floor
I was hoping all this altitude
Would impress her even more

She was amorous
I tried to give her the more of me

More than gorgeous
More than i have ever seen
She was amorous
I tried to give her the more of me
But she was way too much
More than i have ever seen

She was way too delicate
So i had to warn more hands
She seemed a little bit fond of this
But new to romance
Her body was shivering
As she asked me to proceed
She was angel like
As she wrapped her wings
Around me

She was amorous
I tried to give her the more of me
More than gorgeous
More than i have ever seen
She was amorous
I tried to give her the more of me
But she was way too much
More than i have ever seen
