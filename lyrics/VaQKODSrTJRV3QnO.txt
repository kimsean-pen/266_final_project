It's easy, I walk the circle
I come down long ago
But somehow I get lost each time
Feeding this song that deepens inside
That never ends
The voice within eats me up inside

One, I love hurting you
Two, I love your pain
Three, let's get together and
Play the sinner's game
Four, is for the torture and
Five, is for the shame
Cause every time you want it
I get off on this game

You wanted to play
The coldness follows
This isn't a game
Your life, I'll swallow
And I can't help
But smile at your pain
You wanted to play
But I already won

Golding, I plant the seed
Inside your head
Right away, watch it grow
Destroying your insides
Pleading to comfort you
With my sadistic ways
I watch the tears fall
I crack a smile

One, I love hurting you
Two, I love your pain
Three, let's get together and
Play the sinner's game
Four, is for the torture and
Five, is for the shame
Cause every time you want it
I get off on this game

You wanted to play
The coldness follows
This isn't a game
Your life, I'll swallow
And I can't help
But smile at your pain
You wanted to play
But I already won

I look at you and start to crack
Start to crack
I give into, you take it back
Take it back
This lullaby is all you have
All you have
Sadistic pleasure, I attack
I attack
I attack
I attack
I attack

You wanted to play
The coldness follows
This isn't a game
Your life, I'll swallow
And I can't help
But smile at your pain
You wanted to play
But I already won
I already won
I already won
