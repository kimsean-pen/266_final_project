Bow down...
To the greatest corruptor
The second coming of the Antichrist unearthed
Live with a curse
Kill in the name of God, the Devil's won

Knife in the back, we ignored the truth
Rise above, rise above, rise above, rise above
Can you see through the veil that covers you?
Rise above, rise above, rise above, rise above

Evil in place of power

Awoke by a thief...
In the night of retribution
Pandemic welcoming of your final solution
We are cursed
An idol to be your god, the Devil's won

Knife in the back, we ignored the truth
Rise above, rise above, rise above, rise above
Can you see through the veil that covers you?
Rise above, rise above, rise above, rise above

Evil in place of power

Knife in the back, we ignored the truth
Rise above, rise above, rise above, rise above
Can you see through the veil that covers you?
Rise above, rise above, rise above, rise above

Evil in place of...
Power
Power
Power
Evil in place of power
