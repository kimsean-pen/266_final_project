I don't see anything to believe
I don't see the need
When everything you say is true
You're defined by the worst thing you do
The worst thing you do

All the lies and all the pain
Just the devil by another name
All the hate and all the rage
Just the devil by another name

All my life I've been deceived
Left too long to grieve
When your days come down to few
You're defined by the last thing you do
The last thing you do

All the lies and all the pain
Just the devil by another name
All the hate and all the rage
Just the devil by another name

It's all the same
Just the devil by another name
It's all the same
Just the devil by another name

You're defined by the worst thing you do
The worst thing you do
The worst thing you do

All the lies and all the pain
Just the devil by another name
All the hate and all the rage
Just the devil by another name

It's all the same
Just the devil by another name
It's all the same
Just the devil by another name

It's all the same
(It's all the same)
Just the devil by another name
(It's just another name)
It's all the same
(It's all the same)
Just the devil by another name
