Another Friday night of agitation,
So many people but no conversation
All the bands they know,
And they're so outgoing

Buy your tickets for the execution,
The kids are lined up for a prosecution
And they've hung us all,
On their bedroom walls

And as entertaining as it is,
Give up the freak show binge
And rest

Oh now undertaker
Looks like we're getting out to explore
Death pop music maker
Filling hades left to right

I've never seen so many pale males
But I'm the dullest in this fairytale
In my khaki crown
And colourless gown

Innocent and happy smiles
So amused and so unaware
Of death

Oh now undertaker
Looks like we're getting out to explore
Death pop music maker
Filling hades left to right

Oh now undertaker
Looks like we're getting out to explore
Death pop music maker
Filling hades left to right
Filling hades left to right

Oh now undertaker
Looks like we're getting out to explore
Death pop music maker
Filling hades left to right
Filling hades left to right

Oh now undertaker
Death pop music maker

Filling hades left to right

Oh now undertaker
Death pop music maker

Filling hades left to right

Oh now undertaker
Filling hades left to right
Death pop music maker
Filling hades left to right

Oh now undertaker
Filling hades left to right
Death pop music maker
