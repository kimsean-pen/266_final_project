The sun is down when I get out
I just woke up feeling confused
I want to find something new
It's really hard to try to get to you

When we walk around and we're dizzy and all
I don't want it to stop, I don't want it to end
When we pass the time and it's all meaningless
I don't want you to go, I don't want you to leave

And I don't want to be the kind
Who is always feeling sorry for myself
But everything is fading out
And everybody is doing what they are told

When we walk around and we're dizzy and all
I don't want it to stop, I don't want it to end
When we pass the time and it's all meaningless
I don't want you to go, I don't want you to leave
