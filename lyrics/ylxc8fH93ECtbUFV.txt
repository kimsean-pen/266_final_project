He's alone in his house out there
far, far away
he sleeps with his eyes open.

He was so sad last night
in this house out there
he took my hand and whispered.

And life is so sad in this house out
there, his window's alright
his garden is wonderful.

But this waterfall salt tears
comes from him
he will fill his house.

He takes my hand and whisperes:

I'll drown when I see you
I'll drown when I see you
I'll drown when I see you.

These tears run so fast in his
house out there he tried to get
out, his house took our hands and
smiled.

You'll never escape
from this sad, sad house
I take his hand
we sink.

I'll drown when I see you
I'll drown when I see you
I'll drown when I see you
I do
I'll drown when I see you
I'll drown when I see you
I'll drown when I see you
I do
