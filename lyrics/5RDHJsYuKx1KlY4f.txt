As a child I was known for make believin'
All alone I created fantasies
As I grew people called it self-deceiving
But my heart helped me hold the memories

As I walk through the world I find around me
Something new yet familiar's in the air
I feel it everywhere
Like a child's eyes on a Christmas night
I'm looking at you now
Findin' answers to my prayers

It's a new day for those good old dreams
One by one it seems they're comin' true
Here's the morning that my heart had seen
Here's the morning that just had to come through

Same old stage but (what a change of scene)
No more dark horizons, only blue)
It's a new day for those (good old dreams)
(All my life I've dreamed of lovin' you)

You're a spark of a long forgotten fire
You're a touch of a slowly growin' wind
You're a taste of the ever-changing seasons
Tellin' me there are some things that don't end

We have left all the darkness far behind us (behind us)
All those hopes that we had along the way
Have made it to this day
Like an old love song gone for much too long
You hear it once again
And it carries you away

It's a new day for (those good old dreams)
One by one it seems they're (comin' true)
(Here's the morning that my heart had seen)
Here's the morning that just had to come through

Same old stage but (what a change of scene)
No more dark horizons, (only blue)
It's a new day for those (good old dreams)
All my life I've dreamed of you (I've dreamed of you)

It's a new day for those (good old dreams)
And it's all because of you...
