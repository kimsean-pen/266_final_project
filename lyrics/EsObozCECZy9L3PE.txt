Got a classic Red Ryder at Rocky Camp
Out in ol' Hat Creek
Lookin' for jaybirds left and right
Try and knock 'em up out the tree
Everybody I know's watchin' Clint
They all like watchin' Clint

All the little snypes want to be like Clint
They all want to be like Clint
But I want to be like Lee Van Cleef
Ya know I want to be like Lee
What ever happened to Lee Van Cleef?
What ever happened to Lee?

A yellow Studebaker with a 302
A seat of green naugahyde
I put a couple of dings in that pickup truck
A few more dents in his pride
At Hilltop Drive-in they're watchin' Clint
They all like watchin' Clint

On the big screen they want to see old Clint
They all want to see old Clint
But I want to see Lee Van Cleef
Ya know I like to see old Lee
What ever happened to Lee Van Cleef?
What ever happened to Lee?

Now the Studebaker's gone and Lee's passed on
Clint's still as sharp as can be
The Hilltop Drive-in is an auto mall
But no one's built over Lee
We all get a kick out of watchin' Clint
We all get a kick out of Clint

There ain't never been one quite like Clint
There's really only one Clint
But I really did like Lee Van Cleef
I sure did really like Lee
What ever happened to Lee Van Cleef?
What ever happened to Lee?

We still get a kick out of watchin' Clint
We all get a kick out of Clint

There ain't never been one quite like Clint
There's really only one Clint

I always did like Lee Van Cleef
Always did like Lee
Nobody's steely like Lee Van Cleef
What ever happened to Lee?
What ever happened to Lee Van Cleef?
Don't forget about Lee
