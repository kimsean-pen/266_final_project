Identity

Identity is the crisis can't you see
Identity, identity
When you look in the mirror do you see yourself
Do you see yourself on the T.V. screen
Do you see yourself in the magazine
When you see yourself does it make you scream

Identity is the crisis can't you see
Identity, identity, yeaah

Identity is the crisis can't you see
Identity, identity
When you look in the mirror do you smash it quick
Do you take the glass and slash your wrists
Did you do it for fame, did you do it in a fit
Did you do it before you read about it

Identity is the crisis can't you see
Identity, identity, yeaah
