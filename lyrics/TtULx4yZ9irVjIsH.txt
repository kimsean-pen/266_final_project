Strawberry ice cream, I saw this day
You melt away through the cracks in my fingers
I know that sunburn goes away
The broken words I last heard still linger

Maybe by Monday I'll be okay
Any day's better than February
Sometimes I wonder how life would be
Any day's better than February

But if you called and you asked me to stay
Would you give me the world or walk out in a day?
Because I'm so afraid that if I let you in
When the going gets rough will you leave me again?
Like February

Summer's gone, seasons change
He's got a heart of construction paper
All of his problems buried away
Inside the sleeve of a green windbreaker

Maybe by Monday I'll be okay
Any day's better than February
Sometimes I wonder how life would be
Any day's better than February
But if you called and you asked me to stay
Would you give me the world or walk out in a day?
Because I'm so afraid that if I let you in
When the going gets rough will you leave me again?
Like February

Any day's better than the day you left me
Try to forget you but he never lets me

Any day's better than the day you left me
Try to forget you but he never lets me

Maybe by Monday I'll be okay
Any day's better than, any day's better than
Sometimes I wonder how life would be
If you had stayed for February
