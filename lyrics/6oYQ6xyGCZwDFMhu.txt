Ain't got no heart
I ain't got no heart to give away

I sit and laugh at fools in love
There ain't no such thing as love
No angels singing up above today

Girl I don't believe
Girl I don't believe in what you say

You say your heart is only mine
I say to you, You must be blind,
What makes you think that you're so fine

That I would throw away the groovy life I lead
'Cause baby, what you've got yeah
It sure ain't what I need

Girl you better go
Girl you'd better go away
I think that life with you would be
Just not quite the thing for me
Why is it so hard to see my way?

Why should I be stuck with you
It's just not what I want to do
Why should an embrace or two
Make me such a part of you
I ain't got no heart to give away!
