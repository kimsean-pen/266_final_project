So is this were love runs out of patience
With just one question left to be answered
You wanted more but you got it all
A taste of rust, Your are the touch of death
We walk the lines which the sinners led
We are passionate but lost

You, You only think about yourself girl
At least I'm not the one who sells pleasure
(You fucking whore)
You touch my heart when you're feeling down
But when the night falls when the night falls
You're seeking blood just to trap your lust
This will never be ignored

I gave you all but you just kept me burning
You just kept me burning on and on
And now it feels so fine to see you breaking down girl
To see you falling further down from here

She shakes as she turns around
With big tears and her lying mouth
She only wants you to say the words
"I'm sorry my love, can we please turn around?"
This will not be succeeded
We crave for more
You only hear what you want to hear
It's over, It's over, it is over for sure

This will not be relieved no more
This will not be suppressed no more
At least give the illusions back
For a sweeter outcome than this

Prepare for battle
Prepare for war
Prepare for battle

Step back
I need to break her words
One last time
I need to break her words
Step back, Step back, Step back
I need to break her words
One last time
I need to break her words

I gave you all but you just kept me burning
You just kept me burning

I gave you all but you just kept me burning
You just kept me burning on and on
And now it feels so fine to see you breaking down girl
To see you falling further down from here

I gave you all but you just kept me burning
You just kept me burning on and on
And now it feels so fine to see you breaking down girl
To see you falling further down from here

The blood is still warm but her soul has been stolen
And I hope that your parents are proud to hear what you have achieved;
To have a whore of a daughter
Stop! Don't turn this away from you now
You shall bleed it out
You shall never be
You shall never be a part of me
Smile a last smile and believe that
world will go on without you and your lies
The rose will decay
