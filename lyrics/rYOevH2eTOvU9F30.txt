Wasn't like me to fall in love
That's just the way that I was
But now when I feel you holdin' me
Something inside just tells me
You've gotten to this heart of mine
And I know its true cause darlin' I'm...
Darlin I'm starting to find

I'm getting used to you
Ooh, and I'm loving every single thing about you
I'm getting used to you
And I could never get used to living without you

Didn't think that a love could mean that much
But you've sure changed my mind with your touch
Never knew that my heart could need you so
Now I know that these arms can't let you go
No they wouldn't even try
Cause I'm sure that you're the one that I...
Oh, one that I need in my life

I'm getting used to you
Ooh and I'm loving every single thing about you
I'm getting used to you
And I could never get used to living without you

Oh... (Repeat 3x)

You've gotten to this heart of mine
And I know it's true cause darlin' I...
Oh, darlin' I'm starting to find
You're the one I need in my life

I'm getting used to you
Ooh and I'm loving every single thing about you
I'm getting used to you
And I could never get used to living without you
Ain't no living without loving you
