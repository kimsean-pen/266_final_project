You got me all screwed up
So much I can't turn 'round

And I've been running about with some funny girls
I'm not so tough

But if you let me down
I'll tell ya

I'd give you just one day to explain
I'd like to know if there's somebody else in this game
Say it isn't so
Tell me I'm the only one
Say it isn't so
Without you I can't go on
How was I to know
If you keep me guessing I don't understand
I can't sleep at night

I keep on dreaming you're gone
I'm staring into a space that was filled by your face
Facing the day

A face in the crowd

I'm sure I saw you just a moment ago
There must be something you don't want me to know
Say it isn't so
You got the magic touch
Say it isn't so
The one that I need so much
How was I to know
If you keep me guessing I don't understand

There's something wrong, suspicion's getting stronger
Don't know if I can stand this pain much longer
You play around but I see right through you

It's lonely on the streets when it's just 1 a.m.

See a lot of pretty girls passing by

I'm walking in the midnight sun once again

And now I know why love is so blind
'Cos when you're out of my sight
I'm out of your mind

Say it isn't so
Tell me I'm the only one
Say it isn't so
Without you I can't go on
How was I to know
If you keep me guessing I don't understand
Say it isn't so
You got the magic touch
Say it isn't so
The one that I need so much
Say it isn't so
Tell me I'm the only one
Say it isn't so
Without you I can't go on
Say it isn't so

Say it isn't so

Say it isn't so

Say it isn't so
