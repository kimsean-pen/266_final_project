A church house gin house
A school house outhouse
On Highway Number Nineteen
The people keep the city clean.
They call it Nutbush
Oh Nutbush
Call it Nutbush city limits.

Twentyfive was the speed limit
Motorcycle not allowed in it
You go t'the store on Fridays
You go to church on Sundays.
They call it Nutbush, little old town
Oh Nutbush
They call it Nutbush city limits.

You go t'the field on week days
And have a picnic on Labor Day
You go to town on Saturdays
But go to church ev'ry Sunday.
They call it Nutbush
Oh Nutbush
They call it Nutbush city limits.

No whiskey for sale
You get caught, no bail
Saltpork and molasses
Is all you get in jail.
They call it Nutbush
Oh Nutbush
Yeah, they call it Nutbush city

Nutbush city limits.
Little old town in Tennessee
That's called a quiet little old community
A one-horse town
You have to watch
What you're puttin' down in old Nutbush.
