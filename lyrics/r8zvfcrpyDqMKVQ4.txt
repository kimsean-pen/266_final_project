Lately, right now I feel like it's all over
'Cause I've been trapped inside my head for so long
I'm sorry, I should've called when I was sober
Some days I get scared to be alone

I, I'm blacking out
And I can't help it out
I, I scream and shout
And I can't help but

Sleeping with the light on every night
I can't stand my bedroom up with blankets on the couch
Woah, it's killing me, I'm burning up inside
Woah, I'm a mess right now and I'm just freaking out
I'm seeing sounds, I'm freaking out

Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh oh
I'm freaking out
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh, ha
I'm freaking out

It's stupid, but I'm better off and I'll stay quiet
'Cause I pushed away all the ones that hold me close
I'm losing my mind, oh yeah, I just can't take it, no
I'm in the corner, yeah, I'm bleeding on the road

Woah, I, I'm blacking out
And I can't help it out
I, I scream and shout
And I can't help but
Sleeping with the light on every night
I can't stand my bedroom up with blankets on the couch
Woah, it's killing me, I'm burning up inside
Woah, I'm a mess right now and I'm just freaking out
I'm seeing sounds, I'm freaking out

Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh oh
I'm freaking out
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh, ha
I'm freaking out

Woah-oh-oh-oh
I'm freaking out, I'm freaking out
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Freaking out, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm freaking out, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm freaking out
