Here is your redeemer!
Here is your hope!
Here is your messiah!
Worship him now!
Worship him!
Without sin and full of heaven
Furiously searching our reins and hearts
888 the hinge is a priestess
Shedding skin in the sacristy
And if thou be the ONE son of God cast thyself down!
Cast thyself down!
For we have vowed to poison the sky
We even brought songs from the city of blood
Angels kneel as darkness descends
Shedding skin on the throne of light
Here is your saviour!
Here is your trust!
Here is your messiah!
Worship him now
Let him in!
Without skin and full of heaven
Furiously searching our reins and hearts
888 the lamb is ascending
Shedding sins in the realm above

And if thou be the ONE son of God cast thyself down!
Cast thyself down!
For we have come to conquer he lie
Armed with true sight and the worm that cuts rock
Crosses bow as the eye opens
Shedding skin on the throne of light
Here is your redeemer!
Here is your hope!
Here is your messiah!
Worship him now!
Shedding skin!
