Come on let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let go!
A rabid sea-saw
But this exploding your brain it's gonna blow me out me out again
And now i don't feel the same
Come on let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let go! Bionic hee-haww
You can dress yourself to dance
And you can wear your party chains
And i will welcome you the same
Come on let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let go!
It's not a question for your head
Come and join me near the speaker there's a ruby in your eye oh we don't have to be the same.
Cause your ohms the sweetest thing inside of you
Our home is bigger than a mountain view
You find something you believe that you should do
Sometimes it won't come so easy
But sometimes you've gotta go get mad, mad

Come on let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let go!
The shifting ease on / the shift in "e"s on
Let's me trip and i will stay with the reds and then the pains
And now we're going up the same
Come on let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let go!
I've got a question for your head
I made a shadow with my hand
And i made it like your heart
And it will never be the same
Cause your ohms the sweetest thing inside of you
My home is bigger than a mountain view
Your find something you believe that you should do
Sometimes it won't come so easy but sometimes you've gotta go get mad, mad

All the good things
Like having your surf breaks
All of the
Good things
Like friends
From a long way
They'll be some fat kings
You'll see
Comes for
Nothing
And then we watch them
Shred
Feels like
The suns going down
Can you see the clouds
Bet your in baltimore laughing so loud
But have you seen those clouds
Then you should come on out
Today feels so supernatural

Come on let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let go!
Erratic sea-saw is this exploding your brain it's gonna blow me out again
And now i don't feel the same
Come on let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let-let go!
I've got a question for the dead
I made a shadow with my hand
And i made it like your heart
And they will never be the same
Same
