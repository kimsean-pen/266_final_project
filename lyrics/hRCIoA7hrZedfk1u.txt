Pound
For a pound This is me vs. me
Toe to toe
Blow for blow
And you couldn't even know

Make my face see my flesh
Nip it off put me to rest
Make my face see me

Pound
For a pound This is me vs. me
Don't include you
Can't see through my eyes
Even if you want to

Picture perfect rewind
This back to birth
Simply put it's the
Best show on earth

Make my face see my flesh
Nip it off put me to rest
Make my face see me

Make it stop Please stop the room from spinning Pound for a pound
