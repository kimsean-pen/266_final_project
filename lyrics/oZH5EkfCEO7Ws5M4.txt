Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is gettin' tired, need a rest, well, you know what I mean
Fifty eight, that was great, but it's over now and that's all
Somethin' harder's coming up, gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya, grab you hard, make you feel ten feet tall

Well, I hope this baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temperature down and the juke box blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin' like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know there's one thing every single body could use
Yeah, listen to me, baby
Let me tell you what it's all about

Modern times rock and roll
Modern times rock and roll

Get you high heeled guitar, boots, and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest and a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says he's gonna make you a real big star
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants, think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world, gonna know just who you are

Look out
Modern times rock and roll
