A world divided
In a race that no one can win
The worst fears ignited
All the hate that's burning within

Taught to hate anyone that dare stand in our way
Taught to fight the system that keeps
This evil alive and feeds their greed

Are we better?
Old machines have told us who to be
Are we better?
Your hollow voice won't speak for me

Every day we're growing colder
Our divide is growing further and further
The hands of time are moving faster
When will we stop paying
The price of agony?

There's a heart that beats for hope
There's a voice that fights for reason
Look around and see
It's closer than you think

Are we better?
Old machines won't tell us who to be
Are we better?
No one's voice will speak for me

Every day we're growing colder
Our divide is growing further and further
The hands of time are moving faster
When will we stop paying
The price of agony?

A world divided
In a race that no one can win
The worst fears ignited
All the hate that's burning within
Burning within

Destroy the madness
Destroy the madness
No one's voice will speak for me

Every day we're growing colder
Our divide is growing further and further
The hands of time are moving faster
When will we stop paying
The price of agony?

Holding on to what we know
Too proud to change
Too scared to grow
Holding on to what we know
Too proud to change
Too scared to grow
Holding on to what we know
Too proud to change
Too scared to grow
Holding on to what we know
Too proud to change
Too scared to grow
