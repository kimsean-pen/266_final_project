I feel i'm going insane
Spent another day
Thinking bout you
Oh you
You keep ignoring my calls
That doesn't help at all
Can i get through
Oh through

So I'm gonna mix a little bit of this
With a little bit of that
If i'm holding on too tightly i might never comeback
I'ma take my time
And ima smell the flowers
Higher then a tower
Got my tiny umbrella
I'ma take my time
Sipping on a sour
And maybe when the sky's coming down
I'll be the clown with the tiny umbrella

I sent another bouquet
Drowning Tanqueray
What did i do
I do
I know its none of your fault
But its never not something with you
With you

So ima mix a little bit of this
With a little bit of that
If i'm holding on too tightly I might never come back
I'ma take my time
And ima smell the flowers
Higher then a tower
Got my tiny umbrella
I'ma take my time
Sipping on a sour
Maybe when the sky's coming down
I'll be the clown with the tiny umbrella

I don't need you anymore
But i'm on my way
Going back to my roots
Boasting up to get toasted
Bloating up and get roasted
I'm losing it and i love it

Hey dude do you wanna do a shot?
No i don't do shots, i'm more of a cocktail man
Cocktail man?
Ya i like to take my time

Ima take my time
And ima smell the flowers
Higher then a tower
Got my tiny umbrella
I'ma take my time
Sipping on a sour
Maybe when the sky's coming down
I'll be the clown with the tiny umbrella

My tiny umbrella
