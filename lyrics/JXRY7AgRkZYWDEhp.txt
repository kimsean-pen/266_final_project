Take me, break me
Turn me on my head and shake me
'Cause I'm driving under the influence of love
Test me, undress me
Hell, go right ahead and arrest me
'Cause I'm driving under the influence of love

I had me a good long look and
I like everything I see
I've been on a bender, now I surrender
You're gonna have to throw the book at me
I'm sunk, I'm in trouble
Used to be single now I'm seeing double
I'm driving under the influence of love
Ah

I'm on a roll, I'm outta control
Quick, somebody take the wheel
Driving blind, I'm outta my mind
If you were in my shoes
You know how it feels
I'm reckless, I'm a libal
You're the key to my survival
I'm driving under the influence of love

So pay the jailer, set me free
Or lock me up and throw away the key
Driving under the influence
Guilty as charged, I got no defence
Driving under the influence of love
