Facin' your Rockadown stepa gone
Wild indeed all alone
Born in a first damn lone day
So many came up all along

You had many of those days down
Fighting this all alone
So many time lost in a days facing forces
So now me say jam jam

Face on, your Rockadown
Step on son, no walk alone
Pray on, get up all along
Don't do all alone, do all alone

Retired
Here dies
Dream dried
Well, she trie to go

Over she hides,
She cries,
Miss higher Miss higher
Well she's got to know

She was heading to deny what she came for
Spending all her time on the ground floor
She knows here she runs from the back door
Suckin' it up in all then, she gonna beat it all upon
