I suspect whats running round's in your head
Almost embedded when your breath touch mine
Next, next, next, next to you
Lost and embarrassed, there's the clock ticking
Wait less then strength in time
Slow motion loops long for done wishes
as we realize them up before
Here you are mind
What is it good for, you are always on my mind
What is it good for, you are always on my mind
What is it good for, you are always on my mind, you're on my mind
