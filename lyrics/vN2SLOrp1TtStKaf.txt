There's light at the end of this tunnel.
Where I hope you'll be waiting.
It's growing ever brighter
I'll never stop chasing you down!
I can taste the smoke in the air
But then you slip right through my fingers.
Learning to look but never to touch.
I guess it's just bad luck.

Catching flames, is such a dangerous game to play.
When all your left with is burnt fingers; black cinders in the palm of your hands.

You'll always be the place I call home.
Warming the coldest of rooms, I know I'm not alone.
The thought of you keeps me warm!
In the coldest of weather.

You always leave me in the dark.
If I can feel the spark, then why can't you?
Tempting men to fuel the fire.
Boiling their blood, like you knew you would.
You always leave me in the dark.

Boiling their blood, like you knew you would.

Catching flames, is such a dangerous game to play!
