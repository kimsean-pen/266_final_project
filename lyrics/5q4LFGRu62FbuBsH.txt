Let me show you the way through the water
You don't have to explain yourself
Turn your face to the stars
I see you smiling

In summer I drowned you
In winter I found you
As the world falls apart around me
The serpent is dreaming
I don't know this feeling
As we break through the other side

Walking north I can hide for a season
Are you here in the dark with me?
With your voice in the stars
I hear you crying

In summer I drowned you
In winter I found you
As the world falls apart around me
The serpent is dreaming
I don't know this feeling
As we break through the other side

In summer I drowned you
In winter I found you
As the world falls apart around me
The serpent is dreaming
I don't know this feeling
As we break through the other side
