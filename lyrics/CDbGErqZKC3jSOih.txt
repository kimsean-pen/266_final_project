Hey daddy, it's been a long time
Vinnie said you're doing fine
I know we're due a conversation
But I don't wanna let you see me cry

I built walls I can't see over
And I wonder if you're at the other side
'Cause you were never there when I needed you the most
You'll never know, you'll never know how much it hurt
'Cause I was never enough, I was never enough

I can't let the sun come in
I can't let the real love begin
Daddy, you were the first man to leave me
You made my heart break
And I swallow my tears everytime like I'm 13
Daddy, you were the first man to leave me

I wish you could hold me like you mean it
I wish you could guide me by the hand
Just because I wasn't yours doesn't mean you weren't mine
The little girl in me still tries to understand
Why I was never enough, why I was never enough

I can't let the sun come in
I can't let the real love begin
Daddy, you were the first man to leave me
You made my heart break
And I swallow my tears everytime like I'm 13
Daddy, you were the first man to leave me

And you said forever and ever
But forever is no more
And I don't believe you
I don't believe you anymore
You said forever and ever
But forever is a scar
And I don't believe you
I don't believe you anymore

I can't let the sun come in
I can't let the real love begin
Daddy, you were the first man to leave me, oh oh oh
You made my heart break
And I swallow my tears everytime like I'm 13
Daddy, you were the first man to leave me
Daddy, you were the first man to leave me, no
You were the first man to leave me

Hey daddy, it's been a long time
I hope you're proud of your Lorenzo shining bright
