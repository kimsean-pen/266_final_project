Allow me to introduce myself
I am the hottie you roll with, and I
I am a body, a soul, and a mind
Lately, you left me behind

Now we don't seem to talk anymore
We used to kick it like Joe and Obama
Now you just leave me at home playin' mama
You give your friends all your time

Would you like me more
Would you like me more
Would you like me more

If I was a dude
Rollin' with your crew?
Would you give me high-fives
If I was a guy?
And in the end, would you wanna be my friend, too?

Take me out to the ballgame, baby
I wanna stay up and party like a lady
I wanna eat all the biscuits and gravy
Lately I've been so very hungry

Come on, let's get back to when we used to be brothers
How did I end up as only your lover?
I want you over and under the covers
I hate how you run when you're done with me

Would you like me more
Would you like me more
Would you like me more

If I was a dude
Would you think I'm cool?
Could I play in your band
If I was a man?
And if I was a dude
Greasy, tail-fin crew
Would you think I'm fly
If I was a guy?

And in the end, would you wanna be my friend, too?
And in the end, would you wanna be my friend, too?
