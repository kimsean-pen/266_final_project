Do me a favour
And tell me what you think about me
Tell me how you want this to be
Go out on a limb and just dream

Paint a picture
Choose your colours extra wise
Especially what you put on my mind
Imagine what it'd be like to touch the sky (yeah, yeah)

Wha-oh
Your thoughts are gonna pick me up
Do you know, it's good to feel too much?

Whoa, you got my head in the clouds
Whoa, you got me thinking out loud
The more you dream about me
The more that I believe that nothing's ever out of reach
So dream, dream, dream

I breathe your visions
They pull me through the coldest of nights
They steer me towards that moment in time
When you show me what it means for you to be mine
Yeah, yeah

Wha-oh
You're giving me the will to try
Do you know, that there's happy in these eyes?

Whoa, you got my head in the clouds
Whoa, you got me thinking out loud
The more you dream about me
The more that I believe that nothing's ever out of reach
So dream, dream, dream

Ha, it's like my birthday
Every time you look at me
It's like the best thing
Every time that you dream
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Wha-oh
Your thoughts are gonna pick me up
Do you know, it's good to feel too much?
Much

Whoa, you got my head in the clouds
Whoa, you got me thinking out loud
The more you dream about me
The more that I believe that nothing's ever out of reach
So dream, dream, dream
Dream, yeah

The more you dream about me
The more that I believe that nothing's ever out of reach
So dream, dream, dream
Dream
