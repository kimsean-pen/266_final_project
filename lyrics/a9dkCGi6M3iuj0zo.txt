Hard time gettin' to ya, babe
Double take like a real rough trade
Wait and see, I'm a real good lover
Can't judge a book by the cover
I know and you know I know
Can't trust your intuition no more

You look calm and I'll make you smile
Bet ya thought I wouldn't have no style
I'm gonna turn your head around
Won't know 'til you hit the ground
Gonna change the way you feel
I'm gonna roll you like a wheel

High life, I'm a fool for you
Low life, I like to break the rules
First bite, you know I got a taste for you
I'm gonna make you shine

Be a switch to say the least
My beauty gonna meet your beast
Comin' over and shake your tree
My body gonna set you free
I know and you know it's true
Move over, I'm comin' through

High life, I'm a fool for you
Low life, gonna break the rules
First bite, you know I got a taste for you
I'm gonna make you shine

It's all over and I shut you down
I'm gonna chase you 'round and 'round
Mess around with the way you feel
Gonna offer you a whole new deal
Lay it on ya just for kicks
Down on ya like a ton of bricks

High life, I'm a fool for you
Low life, I like to break the rules
First bite, you know I got a taste for you
I'm gonna make you shine

I'm gonna make you shine, shine
