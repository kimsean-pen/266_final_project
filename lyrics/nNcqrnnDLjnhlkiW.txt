Firecrackers go off in the night
Postin' all of the time so you'll see it
Do you think of me once in a while?
Oh, you do? Not sure if I believe it

You say you're fine to go back in time
You gotta get it right, even for the night
Don't give me fire and act all ice
I can't keep up, so indecisive

You say you want a holiday, want a holiday
I know just how to be your escaper
But you don't, don't do anything, give me anything
And I can't be wastin' time if it's failed
There's nothin' that I can do
I just wanna be close to you
I'm surrounded and so confused
I just wanna be close to you

I can't focus on think of my own life
TV shows to distract me from phone screens
I should feel good for a second, oh
Because I'm feelin' nothin' for the rest of the day, oh

You say you're fine to go back in time
You gotta get it right, even for the night

You say you want a holiday, want a holiday
I know just how to be your escaper
But you don't, don't do anything, give me anything
And I can't be wastin' time if it's failed
There's nothin' that I can do
I just wanna be close to you
I'm surrounded and so confused
I just wanna be close to you

I know you don't want me to go
I know you don't want me to go
I know you don't want me to go
I know you don't want me to go, baby

You say you want a holiday, want a holiday
I know just how to be your escaper
But you don't, don't do anything, give me anything
And I can't be wastin' time if it's failed
There's nothin' that I can do
I just wanna be close to you
I'm surrounded and so confused
(I just wanna be close to you)
I just wanna be close to you

I just wanna be close to you
