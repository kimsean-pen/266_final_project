Pick up the phone
I wanna talk
About my day
It really sucked
The sun was out
I thought I was fine
But then you slipped
Into my mind

I wanna see you
But I know I can't
'Cause you're not home
You're never home

I can't remember
Why you left
And why you took
Back all your stuff
I'm sorry I lost
Your favorite t-shirt
I'll buy you a new one
A better one

Pick up the phone
I wanna talk
About how I miss you
I miss you so much

Hop on a plane
Come back and see me
I promise I won't be such a brat
I promise I won't be such a brat
If I promise you anything, I promise you that
I promise you that I won't be a brat
If I promise you anything, I promise you that

I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you

I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
