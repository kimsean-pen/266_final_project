hex on you, what a shame,
curses too, what should you do?
ex on you, next in line,
shames on you all of the time.
and now you're alien
spell it out for yourself
paranoid insane
find another name.
some wishes burn, it's not cruel
stakes are high, low octane fuel
take a dive come back again
want some advice: do not offend.
when i notice i don't show it,
don't blame them,
hex on you.
