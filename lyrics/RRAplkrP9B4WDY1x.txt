Lately, I've been noticing a change in your ugly
My baby, all the time you'll be demanded to smile
To feel all deprived
I wanna show you the colors they hide
I wanna prove that the cat doesn't have to be black
I wanna show you the drugs that they use
All they use against you in the night, they're on drugs

No, I'm freely saying no
Last night was rough, I know
That you don't need to love her, but I don't want
I don't wanna go

Honey, don't pretend that you [?] you're talkin'
Politely, can I ask you what the hell do they have
That you want so bad
I wanna show you it's cool to grow up
I wanna prove that your clock doesn't stop on the climb
I wanna show you the value that you can't help losing
I'm using and you're not the kind

No, I'm freely saying no
Last night was rough, I know
That you don't need to love her, but I don't want
I don't wanna go

I'm freely saying no
Last night was rough, I know
That you don't need to love her
But I'm not gonna go
