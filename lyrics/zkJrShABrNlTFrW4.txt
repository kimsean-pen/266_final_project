Well, I haven't worn it
A steady crown on you
Well I've never needed
Let's find a way to move

Right across the borders
Right across the borders
Right across the borders
But I need your loving now
And I want some basic clout

I've seen some kind of change in the water
I've seen some kind of change in the water

I'll find us the real thing
In my heart, I know
It's some kind of feeling
That everything will grow

Right across the borders
Right across the borders
Right across the borders
But I need your loving now
And I want some basic clout

I've seen some kind of change in the water
I've seen some kind of change in the water
I've seen some kind of change in the water
