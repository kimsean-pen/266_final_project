Wish I was a Kellogg's Cornflake
Floatin' in my bowl, takin' movies
Relaxin' awhile
Livin' in style
Talkin' to a raisin who occasionally plays L.A.
Casually glancing at his toupee

Wish I was an English muffin
'Bout to make the most out of a toaster
I'd ease myself down
Comin' up brown
I prefer boysenberry more than any ordinary jam
I'm a "Citizens for Boysenberry Jam" fan

Ah, south California

If I become a first lieutenant
Would you put my photo on your piano?
"To Mary Jane-
Best wishes, Martin"

Old Roger, draft-dodger, leavin' by the basement door
Everybody knows what he's tippy-toeing down there for

Oh, really?
