There was a time I didn't know what to say
Aaah aah aah ahaa
I c-could never give you away
I was a aaa aah aah ahaa uhm
And I don't care what your friends think
I was a aaaha
Like a bird that is built in your cage
I was a aaa aah aah ahaa

I wanna die when I look in your face
Don't even try getting out of my way
Is like you
Don't realize what you're doing to me
I wanna
Don't wanna
I wanna
Don't wanna
I wanna

There was a time you were in my head
Kept you inside 'cause I wanted you there
I was tongue-tied and I wanna forget
Aaah aah aah ahaa
I want time with you
What's the matter with me?
I wanna
Don't wanna
Don't wanna do this again
Turn on the television
I never tunnel-vision
Aaah aah aah ahaa

I wanna die when I look in your face
Don't even try getting out of my way
Is like you
Don't realize what you're doing to me

I wanna
Don't wanna
I wanna
Don't wanna
I wanna
Uuuh uuhu
I wanna
Don't wanna
Uuuh uuhu
I wanna
Don't wanna
I wanna
Don't wanna

Last night I didn't wanted to have you
I was alright till the morning began
Woke up in the morning distressed
I was alright 'till we do it again

Last night I didn't wanted to have you
I was alright till the morning began
Woke up in the morning distressed
I was alright 'till we do it again

I want time with you
I want time with you
I want time with you
I want time with you
I wanna die when I look at your face
Don't even try getting out of my way
Is like you
Don't realize what you're doing to me

I wanna
Don't wanna
I wanna
Don't wanna
I wanna

I wanna die when I look in your face
Don't even try getting out of my way
Is like you
Don't realize what you're doing to me

I wanna
Don't wanna
I wanna
Don't wanna
