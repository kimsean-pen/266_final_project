i am strong in his hands
i am beyond me
on my own i'm human
and i do faults

i do confess
i feel you trickeling
down my shoulders
from above

mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm

i turn myself in
i give myself up
volunteer
you own me: i'm yours

mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm

you have to trust it
i'm eternally yours
all that i gave them
i gave to you

mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm

so needy of comfort
but too raw to be embraced
undo this privacy
and put me in my place

mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm

generous palmstroke
the hugest of hugs
undo this privacy
embrace

i am strong in his hands
I am beyond me
on my own i'm human
and i do faults

she is strong in his hands
she is beyond her
on her own she is human
and she does faults

she is strong in his hands
she is strong in his hands
she is strong in his hands
she is strong in his hands
