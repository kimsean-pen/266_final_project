From the foot of the bed
To the cold Neapolitan sky
From the back of my mind
To the front of this tired disguise

What's with this moment?
What's with this feeling?
What's with January and the locks on the door?
How do I make my escape?
How do I find what I'm lookin' for?

From the memory of the wall
From the pyramid of cans to the call
From the tender touch of your lips
To the straps slipping off of your hips

What's with this moment?
What's with this feeling?
What's with January and the locks on the door?
How do I make my escape?
How do I find what I'm lookin' for?

Hospitals and lobby lust
Truth in all of its disgust
Love was never blind
But I was
Clouded glass and surface rust
Voices I could never trust
Love was never blind
But I was

From the paper to the glue
On the letters written to you
From the start of the affair
To the last kiss we would share

What's with this moment?
What's with this feeling?
What's with January and the locks on the door?
How do I make my escape?
How do I find what I'm lookin' for?

Hospitals and lobby lust
Truth and all that's discussed
Love was never blind
But I was
Clouded glass and surface rust
Voices I could never trust
Love was never blind
But I was
