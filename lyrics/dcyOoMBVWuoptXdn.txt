Release me
Please come to me
Oh, serendipity

They always saw what I couldn't see
When they tried to take my dignity
But I'm tough, they're getting stronger, growing hard to beat
Always searching for a better way to be me

I'm on a one-way street
My fall from grace complete
But I feel like there's a hazard coming over me
But I take away the feeling that I can't see
And now you stay to me

Serendipity
The way to set us free
'Cause every time I think it over
It comes clear to me
Release me
Please come to me
Oh, serendipity

Just as a dream being detained
My anxiety is what I blame
But I'm tougher, I am stronger and I'm hard to crack
It's a message, it's my destiny to come back

One fallen enemy
A fading entropy
It gets harder, but releases like a heavy rain
It is fatal to believe or to detain pain
Oh, please come to me

Serendipity
The way to set us free
'Cause every time I think it over
It comes clear to me
Release me
Please come to me
Oh, serendipity

As they try to hunt me down
I live my life by their command
I thought I've seen it all
What is the plan
I shouldn't have to fight alone
This is fragile moment
Release me

Serendipity
The way to set us free
'Cause every time I think it over
It comes clear to me
Release me
Please come to me
Oh, serendipity
