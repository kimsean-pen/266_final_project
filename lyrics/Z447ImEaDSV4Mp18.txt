Beyond the ocean size, I'm unaware
Locked out the other side
Like I was never there
Like I was never there

They said the boat had sailed
I'd left them there
Oh how the wind would wail
Like I was never there
Like I was never there

Oh my friends
I am heavy
Can I beat within your heart?
Can I bleed within your love?
Oh my friends

Beyond the ocean size, I'm unaware
Locked out the other side
Like I was never there
Like I was never there

I lost my only space
Two empty stares
Oh how the light would change
Like I was never there
Like I was never there

Oh my friends
I am heavy
Can I beat within your heart?
Can I bleed within your love?
Oh my friends

And all my friends
I am ready
Can I beat within your heart?
Can I bleed within your love?
Oh my friends

And I can't forget it
All of the love
All of the love
As we stood tall together
All of the love
All of the love
And I can't forget it
All of the love
All of the love
As we stood tall together
All of the love
All of the love
And I can't forget it
All of the love
All of the love
As we stood tall together
All of the love
All of the love
And I can't forget it
All of the love
All of the love
As we stood tall together
All of the love
All of the love

And all my friends
I am heavy
Can I beat within your heart?
Can I bleed within your love?
Oh my friends

And all my friends
I am ready
Can I beat within your heart?
Can I bleed within your love?
Oh my friends
