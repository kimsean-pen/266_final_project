You keep saying you got something for me
Something you call love, but I call sex
You've been kissing when you ought-a-be-a screwing
And now someone else can kiss your ass

These boots are made for walking, that's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You been lying and there ain't no believing
And you keep saying when you oughta-be into bed
And you been staying when you ought-a-be-a leaving
And what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet

These boots are made for walking, that's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You keep dressing ways you shouldn't be dressing
And you keep thinking that you'll never get burned, ha!
I just found me a brand new box spring mattress
What? You know, bitch, you got a lot to learn

These boots are made for walkin', that's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots are gonna stomp all over you
Yeah!

Are you ready boots?
Are you ready boots?
Are you ready boots?
Start walking!

And you think I'm kidding, don'tcha?!
