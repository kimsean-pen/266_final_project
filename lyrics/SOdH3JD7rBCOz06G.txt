Scary movies and nightmares to follow
I'm such a wreck when your not aroundand this house is haunted
I swear it's true

But what do I care when it's your ghost that's in my room
I see you
But I can't touch youand it's killing me (and it's killing me)
It's killing me so good
I see you
But I can't touch youand it's killing me (and it's killing me)

It's killing me so good
I'm looking at the stars
I hope you see them too
I miss you

I miss you so good
Everything I do
Reminds me of you
I can't do this without you
I see you
But I can't touch youand it's killing me (and it's killing me)

It's killing me so good
I see you
But I can't touch youand it's killing me (and it's killing me)
It's killing me so good(guitar)

I see you
But I can't touch youand it's killing me (and it's killing me)
It's killing me so good
I see you
But I can't touch youand it's killing me (and it's killing me)
It's killing me so good
