All-seeing eye of God
Pack up your tents to travel
Through lowland countryside
Lay down your hammers, brother

Through open passageways
I felt my breath grow shallow
Lend me your voice, oh God
To scream and shout and bellow
Chew up your love then swallow
Chew up your love then swallow
Chew up your love then swallow

Three stars are pinned above
Howling their hope and shadow
Cast down with weary eyes
And bid their sheep to follow
Chew up your love then swallow
Chew up your love then swallow
Chew up your love then swallow
Chew up your love then swallow...
