I said I played this song
So many times before
that the melody keeps repeating
growing new ideas,
flowing chords and notes
like a mountain river bleeding
.
Well I say as I look back
And all the thoughts I've had
they reflect just what I'm learning
Yes, you know that the hardest part
Yes, I say is to stay on top,
On top of a world forever churning
Whoa yeah, oh yeah.

Well, you say you can laugh,
But I can see that your eye's are glass
Well do you see, can't you see what I'm feeling?
Yes I've seen your face before
Why, I've seen it everywhere,
Showing up to me without a scent revealing.

Well, I said will it ever change?
Well yes lord I said will it stay the same?
I'd surely like to know before it's over.
Well, I said I play this song
I said it won't be long
Won't be long before I stop and play it over.

Oh, oh I've, I've seen your face before
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?
And I, oh I, I've been in one place to long
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?
Oh oh.

Well I, oh I, I've seen your face before.
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?
And I, oh I, I've been in one place to long
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?
