Despite my glorified foresight
No one will be talking in time
Once the limit was the sky, now I'm under watchful eye
Until the day your thoughts align and
Slow down with mine

I'm under surveillance
The path to the poet's ideal
Forever amazed by the way that you spin the wheel
It goes over your head dear
Over your head, over
And I'm in way over my head here, over

And I'm covering up behind design
For you to share your timeless cure
For peace of mind
Because there's far more than meets the eye
That I've come to admire
All that you have in your sight
When I'm slowly losing mine

While I'm under surveillance
The path to the poet's ideal
Forever amazed by the way
That you spin the wheel
It goes over your head dear
Over your head, over
And I'm in way over my head here
Over

Oh and how I long to breathe air
long to beathe air
Oh and how I long to breathe air
Long to breathe air

Long to breathe air
But I'm under surveillance
The path to the poet's ideal
Forever amazed by the way
That you spin the wheel
It goes over your head dear
Over your head, over
And I'm in way over my head here

Over
Oh and how I long to breathe air
long to breathe air
Oh and how I long to breathe air
long to breathe air
Oh and how I long to breathe air
Long to breathe air
Oh and how I long to breathe air
Long to breathe air
Long to breathe air
Long to breathe air
