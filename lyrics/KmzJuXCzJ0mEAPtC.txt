Nothing ever is perfect
There's the good and the bad
Though it's never on purpose
Sometimes I make you sad

The sun don't always shine on you, baby
And that's all right
'Cause that's what happens when you love in real life

This is love
This is love
This is love, this is love, this is love
In real life
This is love, this is love, this is love
In real life

What more could we ask for?
Some kind of fantasy
There's no one I want more
More than anything

We're always coming up roses
And that's alright
'Cause that's what happens when you love in real life

This is love
This is love
This is love, this is love, this is love
In real life
This is love, this is love, this is love
In real life

This is love, oh-oh-oh
This is love, oh-oh-oh

This is love
This is love
This is love, this is love, this is love
This is love, this is love, this is love
This is love in real life
This is love
