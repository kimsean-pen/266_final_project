When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
They're much too big, but I don't care
I feel the weight your shoulders bear
Now I really empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you, you so frustrated
But we all become what we once hated
Besides, nobody can be that wise

I can't help you, if you won't help yourself (If you won't help yourself, help yourself)
No, I can't help you, if you don't help yourself (Help yourself, no, no, no)
You can only get so much from someone else (You can only get so much from me)
I can't help you, if you won't help yourself (You won't help yourself)

You got a degree in philosophy (Philosophy)
So you think you cleverer than me ('Cause you so smart)
But I'm not just some drama queen (Drama queen)
'Cause it's where you're at, not where you've been
So what do you expect from me (What do you want?)
To hold your head above the sea (Keep you high and dry)
And carry you, even though you bigger
'Cause don't you know, you crush my tiny figure
And anyway, we're still so young (Yeah, I'm so young)
And this isn't yesterday

I can't help you, if you won't help yourself (I can't help you)
No, I can't help you, if you don't help yourself (You won't help yourself)
You can only get so much from someone else
I can't help you, if you won't help yourself

You might be twenty-five, but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years old most of the time
And I, I'm just a child and you full grown
And it was like nothing that I've ever known
You are like nothing that I ever knew
