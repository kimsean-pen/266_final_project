Cupid, draw back your bow...
New York
Tell me how you feel about it
We just met yeah
We just met
L.A
Ask me for the truth about it
We just met
And I wish we could be holding hands
I wish we could be holding hands
How do you think it goes

With those tiny little bows
You're the one I want
You're the one I know

And everywhere you are

Is a place I wanna go

Dancin' really high
Dancin' really slow

How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows
You're the one I want

You're the one I know

And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
Dancin' really high
Dancin' really slow

Paris
Do you ever think about us
Watchin' TV in your bed
Hey London
Call me if you think about it
Don't forget
I wish we could be holding hands
I wish we could be holding hands
How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows
You're the one I want
You're the one I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
Dancin' really high
Dancin' really slow
How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows
You're the one I want
You're the one I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
Dancin' really high
Dancin' really slow
(Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart
For me
For me)
How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows
You're the one I want
You're the one I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
Dancin' really high
How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows
You're the one I want
You're the one I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
Dancin' really high
Dancin' really slow
I wish we could be holding hands
Dancin' really high
Dancin' really slow
Dancin' really slow
