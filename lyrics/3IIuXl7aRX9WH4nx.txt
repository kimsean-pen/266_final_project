I try to stay busy
I do the dishes, I mow the lawn
I try to keep myself occupied
Even though I know you're not coming home

I try to keep the house nice and neat
I make my bed, I change the sheets
I even learned how to use the washing machine
Keeping things clean doesn't change anything

What am I gonna do when I run out of shirts to fold?
What am I gonna do when I run out of lawn to mow?
What am I gonna do if you never come home?
Tell me, oh what am I gonna do?

Oh, I hate it
I hate it here
When you're gone

I caught myself thinking
I caught myself thinking once again
I had to try to keep my mind out of this
Try not to pretend

I check the phone
I check the mail
I check the phone again, I call your mom
She says you're not there and I should take care

I hate it here
When you're gone
I hate it
I hate it here
When you're gone

I try to stay busy
I take out the trash, I sweep the floor
I try to keep myself occupied
'Cause I know you don't live here anymore
