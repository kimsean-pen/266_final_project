Those summer nights
Summer nights
I need to think of my life
My life
When the sun's in love
With the sky
Yeah, yeah, yeah
African violet and neon blue
Suits my eyes

You want the sun?
You want the sun, don't you?
You want the sun
You want the sun, don't you?
You want the sun
You want the sun, don't you?
You want the sun
You want the sun, don't you?

I'm in love
I'm in love
But I need to know that we're good
Oh

You been checking the ground wherever I've been
So far, so far, baby
But this time, this love is wrong, love is wrong
You need to be staying

You want the sun?
You want the sun, don't you?
You want the sun
You want the sun, don't you?
You want the sun
You want the sun, don't you?
You want the sun
You want the sun, don't you?

No, flow on
Stay, step right on true love
Oh, still be, for the love
My love I hold for you

No, flow on
Stay, step right on true love
Oh, still be, for the love
My love I hold for you

No, flow on
Stay, step right on true love
Oh, still be, for the love
My love I hold for you
