Her name is Cherry,
we just met
But already she knows me better than you
She understands me,
After 18 years
And you still don't see me like you ought to do

Maybe we could talk 'bout things
if you was made of wood and strings
while I love her every sound
I don't how to turn you down
yeah you're so thick, my patience thin
so I got me a new best friend
with a pick up that was you to shame
And Cheery is her name!

And when I'm lonely Cherry is there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying, yeah you don't care
you won't call me back, you're stubborn as a mule

Maybe we could talk 'bout things if you was made of wood and strings
you might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitar.
