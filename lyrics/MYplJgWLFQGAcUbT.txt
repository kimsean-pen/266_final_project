Hey there pretty lady
Tell me how you're doing
Tell me what can I do to help

'Cause I've been thinking of you
For a little while now
And this right here is how I feel

Girl you got me going crazy
Knocked me off my feet
Now you got me begging baby
Begging baby please
All I wanna know is do you wanna get away
Get away with me
'Cause girl I don't know what to do 'cause I'm so in love with you

Head over my heels
Yeah I know how I feel
Don't you know that I'm in love?
Oh I was so lonely
Now I know you love me
This right here is how I feel

Whoa!

Girl you got me going crazy
Knocked me off my feet
Now you got me begging baby
Begging baby please
All I wanna know is do you wanna get away
Get away with me
'Cause girl I don't know what to do 'cause I'm so in love with you

C'mon!

All I wanna know is do you wanna get away

Yeah!

Girl you got me going crazy
Knocked me off my feet
Now you got me begging baby
Girl I'm on my knees
All I wanna know is do you wanna get away
Get away with me
'Cause girl I don't know what to do 'cause I'm so in love...
So in love...
So in love...
With you

Ah
