Last kiss goodbye
Until next time
Last kiss goodbye, my love
Last kiss goodbye
Until next time
Last kiss goodbye, my love

Maybe that's why they call it falling
All I know is that when I look in your lonely eyes,
My whole world flips upside down,
Baby, it's hard to describe
Why my heart beats so much faster
Whenever you're around me
It makes me sigh

Oh, last kiss goodbye
Until next time
Last kiss goodbye, my love
Last kiss goodbye
Until next time
Last kiss goodbye, my love

Last kiss goodbye
Until next time
Last kiss goodbye, my love
Last kiss goodbye
Until next time
Last kiss goodbye, my love
