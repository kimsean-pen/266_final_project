I have shut the window
Already to defend
What is left to die for
What is left to give
All is about to wither
All is about you
Hard to make up your mind
Hard to get through to me
You gave away the love I gave
You gave away the love I gave
You gave away the love I gave
You gave away the love I gave

I have shut the window
Already to defend
What is left to die for
What is left to give
Time is what's left over
When you've got time to waste
Funny how everything
Falls into place once decisions are made

You gave away the love I gave...
