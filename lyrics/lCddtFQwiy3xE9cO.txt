Walkin' all day with my mouth on fire, tryin' to get talkin' to you
Walkin' all day with my mouth on fire, that's what I've gotta do
Tryin' to get talkin' to you

Walkin' all day with my feet on fire, tryin' to get closer to you
Walkin' all day with my feet on fire, that's what I've gotta do
Tryin' to get closer to you

Walkin' all day with my mind on fire, I can't stop thinking of you
Walkin' all day with my mind on fire, that's what I've gotta do
I can't stop thinkin' of you

Walkin' all day with my hands on fire, wanna get to touch you
Walkin' all day with my hands on fire, that's what I've gotta do
Wanna get to touch you

Walkin' all day with my heart on fire, falling in love with you
Walkin' all day with my heart on fire, that's what I've gotta do
Falling in love with you

Note me
Make me happy
Talk to me
It's so crappy

Ignore me
I'm being happy
Over me
What's this power

Gonna tell you once more
