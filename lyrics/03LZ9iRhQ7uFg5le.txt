I've gone so far, my hands are high
But I want to touch you
Cause I know you're lonely
I've seen despair, but I still care
My heart is together
My head is exploding

Everyone out there says you've been going a bit too hard
Everyone out there says you've been testing man and God
Trying to make the scene
Why don't you come back to me
Why don't you come back to me
Why don't you come back to me

Tired of myself, thank god some help
I'm coming and going
I can't get enough in
Get high, get saved
Look out, be brave
When wings start to rolling, you're hooked on a feeling

Everyone out there says you've been going a bit too hard
Everyone out there says you've been testing man and God
Trying to make the scene
Why don't you come back to me
Why don't you come back to me
Why don't you come back to me

Everyone out there says you've been going a bit too hard
Everyone out there says you've been testing man and God
Trying to make the scene
Why don't you come back to me
Why don't you come back to me
Why don't you come back to me
