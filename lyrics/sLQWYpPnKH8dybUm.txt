Who drains the blood from my head? I do, I do
Who comes through with the meds? I do, I do
Blackened seeds you're gonna need these, freeze!
The common ancestor, the pressure of industry
Who sleeps in the grease, crease wax & trails of mutual deceit?
I heard that growth was gettin' weak
Who taps the line? Records my mind?
Twisted agenda align my spine
Whose got the steeples of people and scepters?
The rocks on the beaches? The angles? The vectors?
Who drains the blood from my head? I do, I do
Who accepts me as I am? I do, I do

Relationships are a tool that can fuel the fa√ßade over my disguise
Fulfill my ego, I do what I do with unrelenting compromise
When it's all on the table, you know I'll be able
To duck, dodge, and run, and hide.
Got a good education in disinformation, adept at constructing lies

The crack on the staircase I smoked out of boredom (And I will get it all)
My kitchen is filled with meat and chloroform (On my own)
Squirming colors metastasize (And I will get it all)
Upon viewing the world the fetus eats its own eyes (On my own)

Acting the fiction and signing the right away
Transistor electrocute, wiping the order away
Awkward offensive hold, perfectly natural
They can't speak 'bout my brand because I'm dead and white

I'm the one, I'm the one
With my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid
I'm the one, I'm the one
with my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid
I'm the one, I'm the one
with my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid
I'm the one, I'm the one
with my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid

So what (I'm the one, I'm the one)
I'll die (With my hands around the gun)
Alone, alright (I am not afraid, I am not afraid)
So what (I'm the one, I'm the one)
I'll die (With my hands around the gun)
Alone, alright (I am not afraid, I am not afraid)

Woke up in a new Bugatti
Then I burned it
Woke up next to Jodi Arias
She my hood bitch
Double it down on all the clowns tryin' to remake DBM
Man, you crazy
We started this sound from Sac Town
Bitch, you best be home by 10
Curfew bitch
