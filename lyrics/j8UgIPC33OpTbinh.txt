I went walking again

I'll go out and forget to tell any of my friends where I'm going

I'm just drunk on the side of the road in a ditch
When you find me
I wanna go home, but I'm sick

There's more whiskey than blood in my veins
More tar than air in my lungs
The strung out call I make
Burned down on the edge of the highway
"I'm sorry for asking, but please, come take me home"
I quit talking again

But I know you're still listening
to see if I sleep or I pierce my skin
Needles to the worn out rags
The folds in my arms, the sickening black
And I haven't been taking my meds
Lock all the cabinets, send me to bed
Cause I know you're still worried I'm gonna get scared
Cause I'm alone again and I don't like the things I see
