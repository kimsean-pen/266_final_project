You mean that much to me and it's hard to show
Gets hectic inside of me when you go

Can I confess these things to you?, well, I don't know
Embedded in my chest and it, hurts to hold

I couldn't spill my heart, my eyes gleam looking in from the dark
I walk out in stormy weather, hold my words, keep us together
Steady walking but bound to trip, should release but just tighten my grip

Night time sympathize I've been working on white lies
So I'll tell the truth, I'll give it up to you and when the day comes it will have all been fun, we'll talk about it soon

And I couldn't spill my heart, my eyes gleam looking in from the dark
I walk out in stormy weather, hope my words, keep us together
Steady walking but bound to trip, should release but just tighten my grip

Night time sympathize I've been working on white lies
So I'll tell the truth, I'll give it up to you and when the day comes it will have all been fun, we'll talk about it soon
