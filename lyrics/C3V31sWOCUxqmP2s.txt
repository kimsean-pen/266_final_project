I've got a rabbit, it likes to hop.
I've got a girl, and she likes to shop.
The other foot looks like it won't drop.
I had an uncle and he got shot.

Is this greeting the type that's meant for me?
Are you part of this kakistocracy?

This ringing in my ears won't stop.
I've got a red Japanese teapot.
I've got a pen but I lost the top.
I've got so many things you haven't got.

This fellow's craft is just not for sharing,
He's not an intimate secretary.

Then on rubble of skull is monarchy.
Down with luck, we'll see ecclesiarchy.
Our fellow's craft is just not for sharing,
He's not an intimate secretary.

(This ringing in my ears won't stop.)
The ex-archives inspector inquisitor.
(I've got a red Japanese teapot.)
The demockery streets master.
(I've got a pen but I lost the top.)
Are you part of this kakistocracy?
