They love you or they hate you
But they will never let you be
They'll thrill you or sedate you
But they will never let you see

In the evening sun
In the evening sun

Encourage & derange you
Watch you walking scared alone
Despite intimidation
Pleased to watch you dance alone

In the evening sun
In the evening sun

Go your separate way now
Someday you'll come back
& I'll be dreaming I was sunburned
I don't wonna make your heart in
& break you heart in two halves
Keep one half
& give one half to me

I like the summer
Miss the summer
Tell me, what'd you do?
Nothing? Me too
Actors they're pretending
& singers they will sometimes lie

Kids are always honest
They don't think their ever gonna die
Oh, you're the pretty smartest captain of the team
I love you more than being 17
In the evening sun
In the evening sun
In the evening sun
