Wait for your caller,
The call never came,
Ready to fall in,
Ready to claim.

I'm ready for it all, love...
I'm ready for the change.
Meet under sunlight,
Meet me again,
In the rain,
In the rain.

Behind the walls, love,
I'm trying to change,
I'm ready for it all, love...
I'm ready for the pain
So meet under blue sky,
Meet me again,
In the rain,
In the rain,
In the rain,
The rain...

Got to find yourself alone in the swirl,
You've got to find yourself alone...
Ooh...
