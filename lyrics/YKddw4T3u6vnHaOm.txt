I've been doomed from the start
Everything around me falls apart
So quickly always end up with a broken heart
Even Tylenol can't fix me
Unless it's mixed with whiskey

I ain't even sad, I'm just bored
Nothing can excite me anymore like it used to
Hollywood has lost all its allure
Used to be so pretty
Now it's just a city

All of these people and all of their friends
Look so good together and I don't fit in
'Cause they're picture perfect
And I'm on the end
Carve me out the photo so they can pretend
Like I don't exist
Like I don't exist
Don't exist
Like I don't exist (no)
Like I don't exist
No

When I feel good it never lasts
That's why you can find me living in a past if you need me
Everybody says this shit will pass
I say it won't, they don't believe me
Just tell me to deep breathe

Falling apart
Don't know what to do, what to do
Looking for someone to save me, I don't know who
I don't know who

All of these people and all of their friends
Look so good together and I don't fit in
'Cause they're picture perfect
And I'm on the end
Carve me out the photo so they can pretend
Like I don't exist
Like I don't exist
Don't exist
Like I don't exist (no)
Like I don't exist
No

Am I even real?
Am I even real?
Am I even real?
Am I even real?
Am I even real?
Am I even real?
It's hard to tell when I can't feel a fucking thing

All of these people and all of their friends
Look so good together and I don't fit in
'Cause they're picture perfect
And I'm on the end
Carve me out the photo so they can pretend
Like I don't exist (no)
Like I don't exist
Don't exist
Like I don't exist (no)
Like I don't exist
No

Am I even real?
