Never knew the softness
of his tender kiss
Don't know if he's weak or strong

All I know is he's in every
dream I dream
all night long

Never heard him speak
a single word of love
Never knew his favorite song
Cause he only speaks to me

in dreams I dream
all night long
When I'm sleep
he tells me he's in love with me
and how much he needs me
to be near

But at best a dream is
just a fantasy
If I touch his hand
he'll disappear

No no no no no
no
Now I don't need a love that's just

a memory
Fate
how could you be
so wrong
Now I gotta find the man
who's haunting me
all
night long
all
night long
all
night long
