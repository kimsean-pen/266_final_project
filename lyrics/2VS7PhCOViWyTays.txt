Let's have a
black
celebration
Tonight

To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black
Day

I look to you
How you carry on
When all hope is gone

Can't you see?
Your optimistic eyes
Seem like paradise
To someone like

Me
I want to take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today

Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Take me in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Forgetting all I couldn't do today

To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black
Day

I look to you
And your strong belief
Me, I want relief
Tonight
Consolation
I want so much
Want to feel your touch
Tonight
Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms
Forgetting all you couldn't do today
