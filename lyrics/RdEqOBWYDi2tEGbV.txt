When she's ok
Then I'm alright
When she's awake
I'm up all night
And nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
I see her face
And in my mind
I sieze the day
Whenever she's nearby
It's like nothing really matters, no
Nothing really matters

She completes me
It's how she reads me
Right or wrong
It's so clear she's
All that I need
All I need yeah

I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
Swimming through the stars when I see her
And I don't need air because I breathe her
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like yeah
I breathe her
Breathe her.

Everytime I see her
Everytime I see her
When I'm lost
And need a sign
She leads the way
And I'll be fine

And nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
She completes me
It's how she reads me
Right or wrong
It's so clear she's

All that I need
All I need yeah
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
Swimming through the stars when I see her
And I don't need air because I breathe her
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like yeah

I breathe her
Breathe her.
Everytime I see her
When she's ok
Then I'm alright
When she's awake
I'm up all night
And nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
