From the cloud You speak
What was veiled now is seen
Jesus the image of
The invisible God

Divinity confirmed
In the transfigured Word
A kingdom once concealed
On the earth now revealed

Holy is the Lord
Revealed before my eyes
And my burning heart
Can scarcely take it in
As I behold Your beauty with unworthy eyes
The only song my soul can find to sing

Is hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah my King

Lead my longing heart
To the high ground
To a clear view
And in awe I'll be there
Beholding You

Holy is the Lord
Revealed before my eyes
And my burning heart
Can scarcely take it in
As I behold Your beauty with unworthy eyes
The only song my soul can find to sing

Is hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah my King
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah my King

Now I know
I have seen
Your glory that cannot be unseen
I am changed
And changing still
As I look upon You Lord and believe

Holy is the Lord
Revealed before my eyes
And my burning heart
Can scarcely take it in
As I behold Your beauty with unworthy eyes
The only song my soul can find to sing

Is hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah my King
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah my King
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah my King
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah my King
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah my King
