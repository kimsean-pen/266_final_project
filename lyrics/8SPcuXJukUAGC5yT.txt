Ladies and Gentlemen,
Boys and girls,
It is my pleasure to introduce to you all
The Finest
The Brightest
The Meanest
This one's the very best of them all
The South London collective group
Known as... for goodness sake Rodger, who is it?

Dis is big bro (bro)
Takin over the show (show)
Wid dis nu flow (flow)
You need to listen up and feel this shit (shit)
Cos we won't quit (quit)
We'll make them hits and stack dem chips

This is flawless i came for the doe
As soon I step in the door
I see that you're hating my glow
The crew, the flow we're soon to blow
We're tired of being this poor and
Havin to sleep on the floor
And workin from a 9 to 5
Just like a 5 dollar whore
Knowin we're worth more
We simply had to settle the score
Thats why you see these albums and these singles in the store
It's Big Brovaz baby
Tryin to cash some major figures
You mess with my cheese
And I'll switch just like Schwarzenegger

Dis is big bro (bro)

You need to listen up and feel this shit (shit)
'Cause we won't quit (quit)

It's Dion
I bet you won't forget my name
I probably maybe gonna
Get inside ya brain
My family does the same
It's BB's time to reign
We doin them platinum things
I know you're not ready for me

You move you lose
Can't wear my shoes
Cherise brand new
Me and my crew
Don't try our flow
If ya tongue don't roll
You'll lose control
We're just way too cold

Hey yo this is Jay Browne
And I've got more skills than average
Put us together man we're more
Than all of y'all can manage
Cauze we be the baddest at it
This here took years of practice
And now its only more
Money and its more madness

Stack up on a daily basis
We've travelled so many places
Switching so many chicks
We're mixing up the names with faces

Cause they see the ice and they trip
They like to ride in the whip
But all I wanna know is if these
Girls is riding the aggggh!

Who's, who's, who's this?

This is the N, A, D, I
You didn't think I was coming at ya
Givin you people a different kind of Big Brovaz flava
I bet y'all didn't think I be
Ridin these beats and makin no paper
Well I guess I'm a paper chaser
Player and it's in my nature
