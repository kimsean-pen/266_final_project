Power, power and Glory
Things my empty soul has craved since dawn
Fury! Eternal painful longing
It grows inside me like a raging storm

Burning, a blaze in my heart
My will, my wish to see it all

Close your eyes and reach beyond the heavens
Touch the moonlit sky
An awe-inspiring view of the world
Feel the beast, go on and grasp your future
Leave the pain behind
On your way beyond, beyond the burning skies

Timeless, stars align in darkness
The universe will fit inside my palm
A Legend, rising from my madness
Eyes wide open storm against the odds

Haunting, a ghost in my soul
My dream, a truth for us all

Close your eyes and reach beyond the heavens
Touch the moonlit sky
An awe-inspiring view of the world
Feel the beast, go on and grasp your future
Leave the pain behind
On your way beyond, beyond the burning skies

Close your eyes and reach beyond the heavens
Touch the moonlit sky
An awe-inspiring view of the world
Feel the beast, go on and grasp your future
Leave the pain behind
On your way beyond

Close your eyes and reach beyond the heavens
Touch the moonlit sky
An awe-inspiring view of the world
Feel the beast, go on and grasp your future
Leave the pain behind
On your way beyond, beyond the burning skies

Close your eyes and reach beyond the heavens
Touch the moonlit sky
An awe-inspiring view of the world
Feel the beast, go on and grasp your future
Leave the pain behind
On your way beyond, beyond the burning skies
