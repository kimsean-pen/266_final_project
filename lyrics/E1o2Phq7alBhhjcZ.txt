she got the world
got the whole wide world
in her world wide world wide hands

she got the stuff
got the stuff you stuff
in her whole wide whole wide hands

and it aint even that she needs sunglasses
i was not so i was not so
and i aint even in to bein passive
i was not so i was not so

but you wanna wake up

you got the best and i will invest
and we're pushin pushin ten

i need the best
and i need a test
but i will not be in him

i love your body
and i love somebody
i was not so i was not so

i love your figure when it hit the mirror
i was not so i was not so

but you wanna wake up

little fit i remember it
i was not speakin up
for a little bit
i wasnt breathin
wasnt even

you wanna wake up
