And in the end we shall achieve in time
The thing they called divine
When all the stars will smile for me
When all is well and well is all for all
And forever after
Maybe in the meantime wait and see
We love the all the all of you
Where lands are green and skies are blue
When all in all we're just like you
We love the all of you
And when I cry for me I cry for you
With tears of holy joy
For all the days you've still to come
And did I ever say I'd never play
Or fly toward the sun
Maybe in the meantime something's gone
We love the all the all of you
Where lands are green and skies are blue
When all in all we're just like you
We love the all of you
Well that sounds fine so I'll see ya sunshine
Give my love to the future of the humankind
Okay, okay, it's not okay
While it's on my mind there's a girl to fit the crime
For a future love dream that I'm still to find
But in the meantime
We love the all the all of you
Where lands are green and skies are blue
When all in all we're just like you
We love the all of you
We love the all the all of you
Where lands are green and skies are blue
When all in all we're just like you
We love the all of you. yeah
We love the all the all of you
Our lands are green and skies are blue
Just like you
Just like you
Just like, just like
Just like you
Just like you
Just like you
Just like, just like
Just like you
