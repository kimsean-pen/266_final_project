She didn't pay admission
Snuck in at intermission
She showed up with a vision on a motherfucking mission
Already high and sweaty like she been up in the kitchen
Looking for some action, tryna build a coalition
Dancing with the passion, you know the position
Running on my troops, tryna rile up my militia
I can't turn her off after I switched on her ignition
She wants to add a friend, and I'm a gifted mathematician

Passion, driven, passion, addict
Passion, basement, passion, addict
Passion, domestic, passion, abroad
Passion, always, passion, god

I have a passion for passions
I come in hot, I turn dragons to ashes
Ignite the whole matchbook of matches
I strike and I don't close the cover or that in the hatches
I look the world in her eyeballs
I tell them my theories, my breakthroughs and the newest of my thoughts
I don't wait for the ovation to conclude
I find applause sounds perfect in the background when I talk, it's like

A sound witness system tweaking in your ear
A sound witness system tweaking in your, tweaking in your ear
A sound witness system tweaking in your ear
A sound witness system tweaking in your, tweaking in your ear
A sound witness system tweaking in your ear
A sound witness system tweaking in your, tweaking in your ear
A sound witness system tweaking in your ear
A sound witness system tweaking in your, tweaking in your ear
