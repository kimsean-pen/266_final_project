Beg for forgiveness no need to ask
I'll be your guidance onto your path
Don't feel no pressure but don't waste my time
I traveled faster to reach my prime

Supersonic polyphonic
This is our war
Mustering the armies marching faster than before
Electronic yet symphonic
This is our score
We are not ironic
We're supersonic

Rush as we cross the speed of sound
Let us lead you to become
The sonic supersonic
Faster than lightning we are higher than life
We are designs
Of a supersonic life

They say I'm crazy
I'm not a fool
Not even listening
I make my rules
Never forgive me
I'm free at last
I'm supersonic
I'm built to last

Supersonic polyphonic
This is our war
Mustering the armies marching faster than before
Electronic yet symphonic
This is our score
We are not ironic
We're supersonic

Rush as we cross the speed of sound
Let us lead you to become
The sonic supersonic
Faster than lightning we are higher than life
We are designs
Of a supersonic life

We're unbound by sonic skies
We're on our way
We're on the rise
Faster than lightning
We are higher than life
We are designs
Of a supersonic life

You cannot control me now
I'm supersonic
Hear me let me show you how
I'm polyphonic
You cannot control me now
Sky's on fire and the house burns down
Scene of the crime at the end of the line
As you turn around the beat goes down

Rush as we cross the speed of sound
Let us lead you to become
The sonic supersonic
Faster than lightning we are higher than life
We are designs
Of a supersonic life

We're unbound by sonic skies
We're on our way
We're on the rise
Faster than lightning
We are higher than life
We are designs
Of a supersonic life
