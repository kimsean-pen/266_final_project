All of me is in your hands
I could go to Rome go to Japan
And find nobody – not even anyone – like you
If the stars fell out of the sky
I know I wouldn't have the time
Cause all I know is that I'm just too into you

When I look into your eyes
They hypnotize me
I can't move;
There's nothing more to say
Hypnotized

If the sky turned pink
I know that I wouldn't blink
Cause all that I know's that I'm just too into you
You taught me how to be
A better man, a better being
And I've been thinkin'
Even though I know that I don't deserve this
I know that I'm worth it, I want prove to you

When I look into your eyes
They hypnotise me
I can't move;
There's nothing more to say
Hypnotized

I'm hypnotized
When I look in your eyes
There's no disguise;
You got my hypnotized
