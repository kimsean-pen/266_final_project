You can't bend your crooked arms
Or fold your punctured proof
The air is growing cold
And there's nothing you can do

Soon there'll be no gauze
Inside the confessional
Only rows of crows
Defrocking every breath

And one day you'll remember
Behind the melting cones
I said one day you'll remember
Behind the melting cones
You've already had a family
In the burial of your home

Not forevermore

And I peel back all of my skin
Peel it back let it all run
And I peel back all of my skin
Peel it back let it all run
And I peel back all of my skin
