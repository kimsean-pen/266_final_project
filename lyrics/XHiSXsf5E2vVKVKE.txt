Humidity's risin'
Barometer's getting low
According to all sources
The street's the place to go

'Cos tonight for the first time
(First time)
Just about half past ten
(Half past ten)
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men
(Start raining men)

It's raining men, Hallelujah
It's raining men, Amen
It's raining men, Hallelujah
It's raining men, Amen

It's raining men, Hallelujah
It's raining men, Amen
I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet

It's rainin' men, Hallelujah
It's rainin' men, every specimen
Tall, blond, dark and mean
Rough and tough and strong and lean

God bless Mother Nature
She's a single woman too
She took over heaven
And she did what she had to do

She taught every angel
To rearrange the sky
So that each and every woman
Could find the perfect guy

(Go get yourself wet girl, I know you want to)

I feel stormy weather moving in
About to begin
(About to to begin)
Hear the thunder, don't you lose your head
Rip off the roof and stay in bed
(Rip off the roof and stay)
It's raining men, Hallelujah
It's raining men, Amen
It's raining men, Hallelujah
It's raining men, Amen
It's raining men, Hallelujah
It's raining men, Amen
It's raining men, Hallelujah
It's raining men, Amen
