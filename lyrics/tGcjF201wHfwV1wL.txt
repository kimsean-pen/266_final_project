There's a man who used to dance
Shuffled down a road less travelled for a second chance
He got faith, but he ain't got no plans
Carrying the world he treasures in his empty hands

Let's not sit and wonder why
We could laugh until we cry
Who knows, it might save a life
Just come with me
Looking back when we get old
The greatest story ever told
Come on, take my hand and hold on tight

We could move in time to our beatin' hearts
We could chase the highs and chase the stars
We could lose ourselves in memories
Leave it all behind and dance with me
Just dance with me

Just dance with me, oh
Just dance with me, oh
Just dance with me, oh
Just dance with me, oh
