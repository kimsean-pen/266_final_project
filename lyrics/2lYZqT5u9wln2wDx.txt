I wanna make your smoke and kisses
Black and White
Measure all your spinning whispers
In the loose moonlight
Magic from your fingers tingles down my spine
Colour inbetween the lines

Let it out, let it out
let it all out
Let it out, let it out
let it all out
You rearrange my mind
You rearrange my mind

An uneasy feeling churns inside of me
I'll draw it on a wall for you all to see
Tryiner find a diamond in an avalanche
But you just haven't had the chance

Oh, Let it out, let it out
let it all out
Let it out, let it out
let it all out
You rearrange my mind
You rearrange my mind

Let it out, let it out
let it all out
Let it out, let it out
let it all out
You rearrange my mind
You rearrange my mind
