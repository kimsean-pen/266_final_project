Don't forget me now, laughing through the tears
For somewhere, somehow, life becomes the years
You speak to millions, but you're talking to no one
Home is the place that you can't walk away from
You seek our opinions but listen to no one
You throw up your hands and tell me that it's all done

We intend to rise through motion, speak through silence
And fight 'til the ocean
No more glimmering hopes or commotions
Our dedications to each other in devotion

No pretending now,
Your heart is open and you reappear
For somewhere, somehow, you drop the fall
And you ran with fear
You speak to millions, but talk to no one
Home is the place you can't walk away from
You seek opinions but listen to no one
You throw up your hands and tell me that it's all done

We intend to rise through motion, speak through silence
And fight 'til the ocean
No more glimmering hopes or commotions
Our dedications to each other in devotion

We intend to speak through peace
Cross the ocean and wake up in the east
Make Jerusalem home for all creeds
Unsheathe your swords and take the ego's beast

I want you, I need you
I pray that God absolves you
Can't live this life without you
I've cleared the coffin for two

I want you, I need you
I pray that God absolves you
Can't live this life without you
I've cleared the coffin for two

Come, today is another day
Come, your hairs are no longer grey
Come, we're clearing the runway
There's no turning back from the path for the chosen ones

We intend to rise through motion, speak through silence
And fight 'til the ocean
No more glimmering hopes or commotions
Our dedications to each other in devotion

We intend to scream through peace
Cross the ocean and wake up in the east
Make Jerusalem home for all the creeds
Unsheathe your swords and take the eagles's peace
