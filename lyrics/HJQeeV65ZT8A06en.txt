There's a knot in my stomach
I can't seem to shake
There's a darkness each morning
That keeps me awake

But I know what's coming
And I don't want to see your face
Come here time go faster
That would have been the answer

It's not the moment before
It's the lifetime after

Well, I don't want to surrender
But I already know our fate
You've been loving me so tender
But now you've lost all fate

But I know what's coming
And I don't want to see your face

Come here time go faster
That would have been the answer
It's not the moment before
It's the lifetime after

Come here time go faster
It would have been the answer
It's not the moment before
It's the lifetime after
