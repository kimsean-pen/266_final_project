Got to get high
To get by
Without you
Got to get high
To get by
Without you
Falling in love
With the same old trap
I'm drifiting away!
Drifting into
Got to get high
To get by
Without you
Got to say
Say to myself
Self wake up
Got to say
Say to myself
Self wake up
Falling apart
With a broken heart
I'm drifiting away
Drifitng into
Got to get high
To get by
Without you
Got to get high
To get by
Without you
Got to get high
To get by
Without you
Got to get high
To get by
Without you
Got to get high
To get by
Without you
Got to get high
To get by
Without you
