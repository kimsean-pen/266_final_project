I don't wanna think about a moment with you
I'm kinda hoping for forever
I've been dreaming about a knitted sweater for two
God dammit, we look good together

Would you wait, a moment?
Ringing the bell for last call?
Would you wait, a moment
Just give me a second, that's all

Talk fast, romance
Won't last, I'm okay with that
Burn, crash, romance
I'll take what I can get from you
Talk fast, romance
Won't last, I'm okay with that
Burn, crash, romance
I'll take what I can get from you

Leave all your indecisions with you at home
Don't say you're doing me a favor
Why so complicated, what you come here for?
I want your love in every flavor

Would you wait, a moment?
Ringing the bell for last call
Would you wait, a moment?
Just give me a second, that's all

Talk fast, romance
Won't last, I'm okay with that
Burn, crash, romance
I'll take what I can get from you
Talk fast, romance
Won't last, I'm okay with that
Burn, crash, romance
I'll take what I can get from you

Oh, ringing the bell for last call
Oh, ringing the bell for last call
Oh, ringing the bell for last call
Oh, ringing the bell for last call

Talk fast, romance

Talk fast, romance
Won't last, I'm okay with that
Burn, crash, romance
I'll take what I can get from you
Talk fast, romance
Won't last, I'm okay with that
Burn, crash, romance
I'll take what I can get from you

Talk fast, oh, oh
Won't last, oh, oh
Burn, crash, oh, oh
Talk fast, oh, oh
