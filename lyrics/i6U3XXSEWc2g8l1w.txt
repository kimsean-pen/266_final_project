Larger than life, sharper than a knife
Ever ready all of the time
Slick and smooth, I'm bound to improve
Your mood and make you feel fine

Sticking to me now, I'm ready and how
I'm really starting to buzz
Your feeling comes, I'm starting to hum
I can do it like nothing else does

You're never alone when I'm around
You can always rely on me
I'm your friend, my love won't bend
And that I can guarantee

Straight and true and all for you
I'm so eager to please
Stick with me and I'll keep you free
From any nasty disease

Cause I'm a vi-vi-vi-vibrator
Pleased and ready to start
Cause I'm a vi-vi-vi-vibrator
With a power pack for a heart

Check my heart before we start
I don't wanna blow no fuse
New battery, is that for me?
That's something I could really use

Power surges, I get the urge
To do my legendary thing
The stars in your eyes don't tell no lies
I know your bells are starting to ring

Cause I'm a vi-vi-vi-vibrator
Pleased and ready to start
Vi-v-vi-vibrator
With a power pack for a heart

Wasn't that good? Wasn't that nice?
Now see, we get along real fine
I knew I was the boy for you
When you came for the second time

Clean me up, put me away
You know you need the rest
I'll be here whenever you need me
I've never ever failed the test

Cause I'm a vi-vi-vi-vibrator
Pleased and ready to start
Cause I'm a vi-vi-vi-vibrator
With a power pack for a heart

Vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vibrator
Pleased and ready to start
Vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vibrator
And you know, I'll never break your heart
