"I lost her in 1978"
He tells me then looks away
It's simple he loved her so
A tenderness you can't let go
He said
"Son you don't forget your first true love
She won't forget you too"

I only like the sad songs
(From the rock bands no one knows)
No one gets me like the sad songs
(When I'm lost and I'm all alone)
Just put the needle on the record
And if only for one second
It's enough

Her father he arranged
The marriage
And he gave away
His daughters heart for goodness sake
What a shame what a big mistake
A daughter's heart's not a good one to break

So I said "love it has no age
Just wait, you'll find someone who will call you 'baby'"

I only like the sad songs
(From the rock bands no one knows)
No one gets me like the sad songs
(When I'm lost and I'm all alone)
Just put the needle on the record
And if only for one second
It's enough

You only like the sad songs?
Well here's a sad song for you my love

I only like the sad songs
(From the rock bands no one knows)
No one gets me like the sad songs
(When I'm lost and I'm all alone)
Just put the needle on the record
And if only for one second
It's enough

You only like the sad songs
You only like the sad songs
You say you like the sad songs
Here's a sad song for you my love
For you my love
