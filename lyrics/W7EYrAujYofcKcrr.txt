If I could invent a time machine, then maybe
We'd both be seventeen

Crusing in my first car, actin like movie stars on a
Friday night
Do you remember those Friday nights?

We were a rock, ready to roll, there was a fire down in our souls
And all the whole world had to stand still, then turn around us
'Cause that was the deal
And oh how those nights went flowing like wine,
When I was all yours and you were all mine
And we were in love, yeah we were in love

I can still see you when I sleep, there is a picture I still keep
You with your hair in the wind and me with that crazy grin
Under summer skies when dreams where too young to die

We were a rock, ready to roll, there was a fire down in our soul
And all the whole world had to stand still, then turn around us
'Cause that was the deal
And oh how those nights went flowing like wine,
When I was all yours and you were all mine
And we were in love, yeah we were in love

Oh I know, I know it sounds crazy but baby your still the one
So let's find a way to bring back the days that our hearts were forever young young

We were a rock, ready to roll, there was a fire down in our soul
And all the whole world had to stand still, then turn around us
'Cause that was the deal
And oh how those nights went flowing like wine,
When I was all yours and you were all mine
And we were in love, yeah we were in love, yeah we were in love
