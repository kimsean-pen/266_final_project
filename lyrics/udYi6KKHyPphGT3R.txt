I knew there was danger
But couldn't resist
The touch of a stranger
The thrill of his kiss

'Cause this time I thought it was love
I thought it was heaven
Having the time of my life
I know it's not true

Oh, never trust a stranger with your heart
Oh no, never trust a stranger with your heart

My world is in pieces
You've stolen my pride
And I'm left defeated
And crushed by your lies
I thought it was love
I thought it was heaven
Having the time of my life
I know it's not true

Oh, never trust a stranger with your heart
Oh, no, never trust a stranger with your heart

Like a tiger you hunted and tracked me down
Savaged my soul and took over control
And then you used all the love you found
You left without trace not a note or a single goodbye

I thought it was love
I thought it was heaven
Having the time of my life
I know it's not true

Oh, never trust a stranger with your heart
Oh, no, never trust a stranger with your heart
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
