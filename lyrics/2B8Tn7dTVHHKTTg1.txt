Here we go, lost in the lessons
Sometimes i mess up my intentions
I get lost, the cost was losing everything I've known
Laying here, staring at the ceiling

Sometimes still dealing with the feelings
Where I've been, what I've done
I'm so far out there on my own
So quick to point the finger

To find the one to blame
So hard to realize, I kept getting in my own way
I never thought that i was that strong

To carry on, carry on tonight
Forgiveness in your eyes, with nothing to hide
All and all, it's shown me
It's a beautiful world
It's a beautiful world

No more fearing my reflection
Here I am, with these imperfections
You know my flaws
But you don't care, can take them all

Till now I was barely breathing
But you gave me something to believe in
We're writing history
Life's made up of small victories

We could go round in circles
And never get to here
So good to realize that we have nothing left to fear

I never thought that I was that strong
To carry on, carry on tonight
Forgiveness in your eyes, with nothing to hide
All and all, it's shown me
It's a beautiful world

It's a beautiful world
So quick to point the finger
Where I was me to blame
So hard to realize that I can't get in my own way

I never thought that I was that strong
To carry on, carry on tonight
Forgiveness in your eyes, with nothing to hide
All and all, it's shown me

It's a beautiful world
Oh the sun has a light
Let's watch it shine for you and I
Oh these open skies
Can we just lie here a while
In this beautiful world
I never thought that I was that strong
To carry on, carry on tonight
It's a beautiful world
It's a beautiful world
