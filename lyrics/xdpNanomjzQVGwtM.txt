Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Now you too busy for me girl, like I was to you

Wish I could stop by and maybe say hi
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say hi
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side

The tables have turned and I've finally learned
That this is makin' up for every day I was gone
And that's why I'm concerned but now it's confirmed

That you spread your wings and learned to fly but all alone
Darkness in the night, I'll find that light for you

As long as I got eyes, I'll have a sight for you
Long as I'm alive baby, I'd die for you, wanna be with you
Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Now you too busy for me girl, like I was to you

Wish I could stop by and maybe say hi
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say hi
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side

You're always on my mind, while I'm racin', while I'm paper chasin'
You were there when I said one day I'd get up out that basement
Playin' as my agent, for you there's no replacement
You will always be my girl, they can hold me on that statement

Darkness in the night, I'll find that light for you
As long as I got eyes, I'll have a sight for you
Long as I'm alive baby, I'd die for you, wanna be with you
Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Now you too busy for me girl, like I was to you
Wish I could stop by and maybe say hi

Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say hi
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Baby, I know you and how we do
Doin' exactly what I taught you
Gotta get that money first before you

Come spend that precious time with your boo
And know I gotta just take it
Even though it's drivin' me crazy
Always wanted to see my girl make it

Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Now you too busy for me girl, like I was to you

'Cause I wish I could stop by and maybe say hi
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say hi
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Now you too busy for me girl, like I was to you
Wish I could stop by and maybe say hi
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say hi
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
I just wanna keep you longer
I just wanna keep you longer
