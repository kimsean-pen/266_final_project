the path
Lost everything I ever had
And everything I ever was
My only wish was to find myself
What would I see?
I lost the path I always walked along
Am I wrong? Am I wrong?

You are drowning
Try to reach you
You are tumbling
I can't reach for you

The warmth seems colder than it was
emotions dull as underwater
All the memories seem so far away
Which inspired me to dream
I lost the path I always walked along
Am I wrong? Am I wrong?

You are drowning
Try to reach you
You are tumbling
I can't reach for you
