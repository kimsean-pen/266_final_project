I used to be like you
The first to walk away
I never thought that I'd see the day
That I'd start a new
I was insane, but not like you

You're a natural disaster and I am
Watching you blow up everything
You touch and the earth will crumble
You speak and hurricanes attack
I am pulling out the windows to prepare for you
When I hear your name
Some great deluge
Janie in love
Janie in love
Janie in love
Janie in love
Janie in love
Janie in love

I have a dancer in the vault
Seeing you fall, I miss it all
I dreamt of you
Some portrait of the way
I'd command the colors
Stop counting the days

You're a natural disaster and I am
Watching you blow up everything
You touch and the earth will crumble
You speak and hurricanes attack
I am pulling out the windows to prepare for you
When I hear your name
Some great deluge
Janie in love
Janie in love
Janie in love
Janie in love
Janie in love
Janie in love

Another time, another place
We would have been
Golden
