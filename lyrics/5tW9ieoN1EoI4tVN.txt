The way he moves, the way he dress
the way he speaks when hes depressed
Im never bored
he says realitys a froad

The way Im lying to impress
aint even in his interest
Dont get the deal
I tell myself
my dream is real

When its all done done done done
in a second hes gone gone
and everything he felt
is back to being numb
When its all done done done done
in a second hes gone gone
He said thats what he felt and
I am just that dumb

The way Im lying to myself
aint even in his interest
Dont get the deal
I tell myself
my dream is real

When its all done done done done
in a second hes gone gone
and everything he felt
is back to being numb
When its all done done done done
in a second hes gone gone
He said thats what he felt and
I am just that dumb

You should know that, nothing compares with you
You should see that, when all I see is you
When I touch them, you should know all I feel is you
You should know that, nothing compares with you, with you, with you

When its all done done done done
in a second hes gone gone
and everything he felt
is back to being numb
When its all done done done done
in a second hes gone gone
He said thats what he felt and
I am just that dumb
