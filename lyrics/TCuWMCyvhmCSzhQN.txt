On a long and lonesome highway
East of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moanin' out his one note song
You'd think about the woman
Or the girl you knew the night before

But your thoughts will soon be wanderin'
The way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours
There's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like ridin'
You just wish the trip was through

Here I am
On the road again
There I am
Up on the stage
There I go
Playin' star again
There I go
Turn the page

So you walk into this restaurant
All strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shakin' off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explode

Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk
Other times you can, all the same old clich√©'s
"Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make your stand
Make your stand

Now here I am
On the road again
There I am
Up on the stage
Here I go
Playin' star again
There I go
Turn the page

Out there in the spotlight
You're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy
You try to give away
As the sweat pours out your body
Like the music that you play

Later in the evenin'
As you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Rememberin' what she said
What she said

And here I am
On the road again
There I am
Up on that stage
And here I go
Playin' star again
And there I go
Turn the page
And there I go
Turn that page
There I go
There I go

There I go
Here I go
There I go
There I go

And I'm gone
