It's too much - Not enough
What you need - I don't get
I don't know why you never say - You never do

Is this my luck again?
Silent words never shed
All I get is you turning away

You turn so cold - It's never enough
It's always too much for what you never say
What you never go and say
You're so cold - It's never enough
It's always too much for what you never say
Never do - Never say

Is it me that you see,
Changing what you think you need?
All I can say is,
I'll always trade me for you
Is it my heart I break?
Hard to give what you won't take
If you did, would you throw it away?

And turn so cold - It's never enough
It's always too much for what you never say
What you never go and say
You're so cold - It's never enough
It's always too much for what you never say
Never do - Never say...
Our time is slipping away... Slipping away

Isn't my word enough?
What I say, is what you get
And all I get is you turning away

You turn so cold - It's never enough
It's always too much for what you never say
What you never go and say
You're so cold - It's never enough
It's always too much for what you never say
Never do - Never say...
Our time is slipping away... Slipping away
...And all I get is you turning away
