With dirt on your knees and blood in your teeth
You want life to lead you to believe in something
But it's coming
Oh oh, the numbing
So we dive on in to the deeper end
For a blissful kiss from Judas' lips
But it's coming
Oh yeah, the numbing

Super novacaine
(You're dead as dead can be)
You won't feel a thing
Sleepwalking
(You're dead as dead can be)
You won't feel a thing

Analysed and diagnosed
Over exposed to the undertow
You'll never know it's coming
Oh oh, the numbing
So you meditate or medicate
To maintain with a getaway
But it's coming
Oh yeah, the numbing

Super novacaine
(You're dead as dead can be)
You won't feel a thing
Sleepwalking
(You're dead as dead can be)
You won't feel a thing

Super novacaine
(You're dead as dead can be)
You won't feel a thing
Sleepwalking
(You're dead as dead can be)
Living in a dream

Super novacaine
(You're dead as dead can be)
You won't feel a thing
Sleepwalking
(You're dead as dead can be)
You won't feel a thing
