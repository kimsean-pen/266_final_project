Can I see what's going wrong with me?
I used to have it all now I'm alone.
I never said I'm better off this way.
I need something to do.
Somewhere to go.

I need time to stop moving.
I need time to stay useless.
I need time to stop moving.
I need time to stay useless.
I need time to stop moving.
I need time to stay useless.

I need time.

Can I feel so udderly unreal?
That nothing I could do would make things change.
I'm stuck in here.
I'm tired of every where.
I'm never going to learn
to be alone.

I need time to stop moving.
I need time to stay useless.
I need time to stop moving.
I need time to stay useless.
I need time to stop moving.
I need time to stay useless.
I need time.
