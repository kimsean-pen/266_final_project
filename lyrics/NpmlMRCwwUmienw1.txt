She does her best
Thinking in the morning
She barely sleeps
But that don't bother her

Penelope
The whole world drives you crazy
But not half as crazy as you drive the world

She reads her books
And goes out every evening
She ran away
When she was just a girl

Penelope
The whole world drives you crazy
But not half as crazy as you drive the world

And she loves riding on her bicycle
Through the middle of town when the whole town's asleep
And she's not wearing anything
But a tattoo of a wedding ring
From another life but that life was blur

Penelope
The whole world drives you crazy
But not half as crazy as you drive the world
Penelope
The whole world drives you crazy
But not half as crazy as you drive the world
