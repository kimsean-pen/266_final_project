They tell you a good girl is quiet
And that you should never ask why
'Cause it only makes it harder to fit in
You should be happy, excited
Even if you're just invited
'Cause the winners
Need someone to clap for them

It's so hard just waiting
In a line that never moves
It's time you started making
Your own rules

You gotta scream until there's nothin' left with your last breath
Say here I am, here I am
Make 'em listen
'Cause there's no way you'll be ignored
Not anymore
So here I am, here I am
Here I am, here I am

You only get one life to work it so who cares if it's not perfect
Say it's close enough to perfect for me
Why should you hide from the thunder and the lightning that you're under
'Cause there ain't nobody else
You wanna be

If how your living isn't working
There's one thing that will help
You gotta finally just stop searchin'
To find yourself

You gotta scream until there's nothin' left with your last breath
So here I am, here I am, make 'em listen
'Cause there's no way you'll be ignored
Not anymore
So here I am, here I am, here I am

The world better make some room
Yeah, move over, over
'Cause you're coming through
'Cause you're coming through

You gotta scream until there's nothin' left With your last breath
Here I am, here I am, make 'em listen
'Cause there is no way you'll be ignored
Not anymore
So here I am, here I am, here I am
Here I am, here I am
