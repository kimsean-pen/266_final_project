Oh, you make my mind go crazy
Crazier than it already is
I've searched high and low for someone just like you
They don't exist
Oh you make my mind go crazy
Crazier than it already is
I've searched high and low for someone just like you
They don't exist

Oh, it breaks me down
I left blood stains all over the haunted town
Oh, it breaks me down
I tried to take my life in that tortured house
Voices in my head don't wanna talk out loud
This ain't allowed
I wonder if it rains in hell
I'm raining hell
Life is a game where you play to fail
They see me speaking on not feeling well

Oh, you make my mind go crazy
Crazier than it already is
I've searched high and low for someone just like you
They don't exist
You make my mind go crazy
Crazier than it already is
I've searched high and low for someone just like you
They don't exist

Oh, it breaks me down
I left blood stains all over the haunted town
Oh, it breaks me down
I tried to take my life in that tortured house
Voices in my head don't wanna talk out loud
This ain't allowed
I wonder if it rains in hell
I'm raining hell
Life is a game where you play to fail
They see me speaking on not feeling well

If you got a problem then I'll be there just one call away
I know where you work too
That you're watching every move I make
I've been to so many different places
With so many different faces around
But nothing compares to that old familiar face
Oh, it breaks me down
