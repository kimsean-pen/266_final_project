Don't believe the church and state and everything they tell you.
Believe in me, I'm with the high command.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.
Use it only in emergency.
Better you should pray to God, the father, and the spirit will guide you and protect you from up here.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Hear me calling you
Can you hear me?
Can you...
Can you hear me?
