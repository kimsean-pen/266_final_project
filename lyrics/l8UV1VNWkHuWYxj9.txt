Treasure the day
It won't return
Step away and let it burn

Flip a coin
Don't abide
Friends will change you on each side

Feel the water
Tender embrace
Cover
Hidden trace

Witness the details
Lead to your goal
See how the formula
Turns to coal

Set free the tension
Steer back the wheels
Turn around
See how it feels

Way below
Base of your soul
Realize everything
Playing a role

Watch it burn
Even though you fear
It might just turn
Into more coal
