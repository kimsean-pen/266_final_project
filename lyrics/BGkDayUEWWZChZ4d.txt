Wanton play, she's so vague and vogue
Another beauty beyond compare
Though I remain to be remade and remote
Don't ... or disown me, babe

You let 'em see you naked, girl
You let 'em look inside
You never knew you were naked, girl
You didn't need to hide

Not one expression on that face
Will ever give her game away
No, no emotion, not a trace
And so you beg for her to stay

Where does the love of Pandora
Not leave destruction in its wake?

In her innocent way unafraid she will rise
On the crest of a wave tonight
That could imitate, but could never take the place
To be the only dream we had

You let 'em see you naked, girl
You let 'em look inside
You never knew you were naked, girl
You didn't need to hide

Not one expression on that face
Will ever give her game away
No, no emotion, not a trace
And so you beg for her to stay

Where does the love of Pandora
Not leave destruction in its wake?

You can't fake 'em on broken promises
And her beauty is plain
She won't fade on written pages
Only altered the same

Not one expression on that face
Will ever give her game away
No, no emotion, not a trace
And so you beg for her to stay

Where does the love of Pandora
Not leave destruction in its wake?
