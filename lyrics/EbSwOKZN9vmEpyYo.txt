I'm not one to look behind
I know that times must change
But over there in Barrytown
They do things very strange

And though you're not my enemy
I like things like they used to be
And though you'd like some company
I'm standing by myself
Go play with someone else

I can see by what you carry
That you come from Barrytown

Don't believe I'm taken in
By stories I have heard
I just read the Daily News
And swear by every word

And don't think that I'm out of line
For speaking out for what is mine
I'd like to see you do just fine
But look at what you wear
And the way you cut your hair

I can see by what you carry
That you come from Barrytown

In the beginning we recall
That the word was hurled
Barrytown people got to be
From another world

Leave me or I'll be just like
The others you will meet
They won't act as kindly
If they see you on the street

And don't you scream or make a shout
There's nothing you can do about
It was there where you came out
It's a special lack of grace
I can see it in your face

I can see by what you carry
That you come from Barrytown
