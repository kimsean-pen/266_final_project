One... step...
One... step...

As I witness the death of innocence
A predator feeding on its creation
Through the fallout of this hallucination
I (I...) walked into darkness

Must not surrender my god to anyone (one.)
Or this body will become carrion

One step closer
One step closer to my fate
One step closer
One step closer to the grave

As I witness my own degeneration
The future condemns me

Must not surrender my god to anyone (one.)
Or this body will become carrion

One step closer
One step closer to my fate
One step closer
One step closer to the grave...

One...
One...

One step closer, one step closer
One step closer to my fate

One step closer
One step closer to my fate
One step closer
One step closer to the grave

One step closer (to my fate)
One step closer (to my fate)
One step closer (to my fate)
One step closer to the grave...
