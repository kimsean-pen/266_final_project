So you want to be a rock 'n' roll star?
Then listen now to what I say
Just get an electric guitar
Then take some time and learn how to play
And with your hair swung right and your pants fit tight
It's gonna be all right

Then it's time to go downtown
Where the agent man won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company
Who are waiting there to sell plasticware
And in a week or two, if you make the charts
The girls'll tear you apart

Price you paid for your riches and fame
Was it all a strange game? You're a little insane
The money that came and the public acclaim
Don't forget what you are
You're a rock 'n' roll star
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
