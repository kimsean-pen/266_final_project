Out on the street I was talkin' to a man
He said, "There's so much of this life of mine that I don't understand"
You shouldn't worry, yes that ain't no crime
'Cause if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time
Next time

You need direction, yeah you need a name
When you're standing in the crossroads every highway looks the same
After a while you get to recognize the signs
So if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time
Next time

Life is a liar, yeah life is a cheat
It'll lead you on and pull the ground from underneath your feet
No use complainin', don't you worry, don't you whine
'Cause if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time
Next time

You gotta grow, you gotta learn by your mistakes
You gotta die a little everyday just to try to stay awake
When you believe there's no mountain you can't climb
And if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time
Next time

Next time

Hmmm - mmm - mmm
