In the shadow of my doubt
This life is dust on naked walls
In the ruins of defeat
The spotlights fade
There's a clown without a crowd
His sorrow smiles relentlessly
Welcome winter bittersweet
Of final fall

My train of thoughts
Keep on hauling me over a low again
Easy to see for a someone
Whose soul can bleed

Who am I to overrule
Believers at the wonder wall
Some illusions come undone
And violently

My train of thoughts
Keep on hauling me over a low again
Easy to see for a someone
Whose soul can bleed

My train of thoughts
Keep on hauling me over a low again
Easy to see for a someone
Whose soul can bleed

So far astray
When all comes to all
You'll never be satisfied
You might as well let go

My train of thoughts
Keep on hauling me over a low again
Easy to see for a someone
Whose soul can bleed

My train of thoughts
Keep on hauling me over a low again
Easy to see for a someone
Whose soul can bleed
