Some look to the sky for truth
I look across the room
Katie's dress in full bloom
Yellows and blues

But I prefer kick drums and red wine
I prefer kick drums and red wine
I prefer kick drums and red wine
I prefer kick drums and red wine

Some people find it with devotion
Some with gold and some with bourbon
Some like praying to the blue skies
Some like putting on a disguise

But I prefer kick drums and red wine
I prefer kick drums and red wine
I prefer kick drums and red wine
I prefer kick drums and red wine
