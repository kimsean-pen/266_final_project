Don, Don, gimme, J White Don,

Ayo
It's crunch time niggas in 9, come get yo dick slime
Noriega, Gary NoÃ«l running through my bloodline
Jet set what bitches gone bench, they swinging bullets
Government give me your money, cash out on one cheques

I never flopped, ask about me If you want
If you see me in the bank, come bout to fuck a couple racks
Ay, heads turn,
When enter, got the best furs to your mister
But I want him he go shit,
I'm a big bird not slender

Juice strip, color greens, dirty money,
pussy clean T.E. bit, need It like a dumpling while I'm counting pee
On your knees hot (one),
prih I like flukkle duty Eat It's p*ssy
like It's finger lickin' chicken on a mollies
Bitches steady, trippin' they be hatin', 'cause I'm stuntin'
When I pull up they be dippin' on this hoes and sayin' nothin'

Rule number one never fuck with a Don
Shots to your bun,
If I'm coming better run
Bitches steady, trippin' they be hatin', 'cause I'm stuntin'
When I pull up they be dippin' on this hoes and sayin' shit
Rule number one never fuck with a Don
Shots to your bun,

Get' em up, lick' em down, they don't want this problems now
Yeah these hoes see me, they see me but they don't want me round'
Keep your crown clown,
I'ma done what the bloodclaat
Me nuh talk I need vicious women in the blood bath
Let' em marinade and fry 'em till they turn soft
Ejaculute on bitches and tell them to lick your cum off

Who she think she really playin' with
I'm that kid with no patience,
I ain't playing b*tch
Talk of lips, moving quit,
Ain't saying shit Dark knight in the light, call the agent quick

B*tches steady, trippin' they be hatin', 'cause I'm stuntin'
When I pull up they be dippin' on this hoes and sayin' nothin'
Rule number one never f*ck with a Don
Shots to your bun,
If I'm coming better run Bitches steady,
trippin' they be hatin', 'cause I'm stuntin'
When I pull up they be dippin' on this hoes and sayin' nothin
Rule number one never fuck with a Don
Shots to your bun, If I'm coming better run bitch
