There's no talking to him
His eyes are born from the stead and rapid water
I WANT JUST TO SIT WITH HIM
Aging off the notion of a lifetime on earth

There's no working it out
My wanting is beyond our fields of formula
THERE'S NO BOUNDERY TO DEVOTION
No territory to handle and cut neatly in two

I wish I knew, I wish I knew
I wish I knew, I wish I knew
I wish I knew, I wish I knew

No sign on the door
No title to the deeds I'm digging for
UPON WE WAIT INTO AN OCEAN
Blind out all the certainty and call it as I did

Here is reason to vice
Softening the corners of my eyes
I WAS BOLD, I WAS THE AUTHOR
Doubt crept in my sickle thoughts
And dragged me through the freeze

I wish I knew, I wish I knew
I wish I knew, I wish I knew
I wish I knew, I wish I knew
I think I knew, I think I knew
I think I knew, I think I knew
I think I knew, I think I knew

What did you want?
EVERYTHING
How would you have heard me?
ON MY KNEES
There is no one that can be opened
This one to cut the harm to the other one to choose

I wish I knew, I wish I knew
I wish I knew, I wish I knew
