Yulia, what do you see in him?
Yulia, what could you want from him?
You're the same age as me
And there's nothing that I can see
No unified theory
That will convince me

Yulia, what do you see in him?
Painting lions on the back of a cookie tin?
Is it better to be different than to be better?
Yulia, how can you be with him?
You're the same age as me
And there's nothing that I can see
No unified theory
That will convince me

That you are happy
