There's something in the air
I can feel it everywhere
If you look up at the stars
You can see the them falling
There are men in uniform
That are knocking at the door
So I hide behind
The memory of you and me

Will time help
Heal the wounds
We knew what we were getting into
I don't know
If I can make it through the night

Now, now that you're gone
I'm wasting away
You left me here
It's so unfair
To live another day
Now, now that you're gone
And nothing's the same
I'll find a way to numb the pain
I'll carry on

All the pictures still repeat
On a screen inside of my brain
And I can see you walking
Through all of the flames
It's way too far to reach
And somehow it don't feel real
I wish I had the strength to feel

Will time help
Heal the wounds
We knew what we were getting into
I don't know
If i can make it through the night

Now, now that you're gone
I'm wasting away
You left me here
It's so unfair
To live another day
Now, now that you're gone
And nothing's the same
I'll find a way to numb the pain
I'll carry on

This is how it has to be
This war that we lost
There is nothing left for me
Will keep tearing you apart long after us
This blood that's been shed
Will keep raining down until the end

Now, now that you're gone
I'm wasting away
You left me here
It's so unfair
To live another day
Now, now that you're gone
And nothing's the same
I'll find a way to numb the pain
I'll carry on

Now, now that you're gone
I'm wasting away
You left me here
It's so unfair
To live another day
Now, now that you're gone
And nothing's the same
I'll find a way to numb the pain
I'll carry on

The phone doesn't ring
My stomach's crawling
