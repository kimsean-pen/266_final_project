Here we go

You wear your smile like a summer sky
Just shining down on me and you
I swear your heart is a, a free bird
On a lazy Sunday afternoon

I love the way that you were up for anything
Never worried 'bout what people say, that's right
Oh, that's right, what we got is

Just like driving on an open highway
Never knowing what we're gonna find
Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up
Whoa, yeah, that's our kind of love

Mmm, that's our kind of love

Skipping rocks and leaving footprints
Down there on the riverbank
Always holding hands, never making plans
Just living in the moment, babe

You get me laughing with those funny faces
You somehow always know just what to say, that's right
Whoa, that's right, what we got is

Just like driving on an open highway
Never knowing what we're gonna find
Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up
Whoa, yeah, that's our kind of love

That's our kind of love

Oh, that's right, baby, you and I
What we got is

Just like driving on an open highway
Never knowing what we're gonna find
Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up
Whoa, oh, oh yeah

Just like driving on an open highway
Never knowing what we're gonna find
Just like two kids, baby, always trying to live it up
Whoa, yeah, that's our kind of love

Ooh, that's our kind of love
Whoa, that's our kind of love

1, 2, 3, here we go
Ooh, yeah
That's our kind of love, girl
Don't ya know it?
