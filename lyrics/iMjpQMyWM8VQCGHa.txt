There was once a special book
It got changed by fascist crooks
(Save me please for I am weak)

There once was a great idea
Now they water it down to fizz
(Save me please for I am weak)
(Save me please for I'm a sheep)

Well I suppose it's human nature,
But when he said,
Don't make an idol of me
Don't make an idol of me
Don't make an idol of me

The Roman Empire never died
(Save me I am not a goat)
It just changed into the Catholic Church
(Dionysis has cloven hooves)
The Roman Empire never died
(Devil horns are not on me, save me I am not a goat)
ha ha ha ha

But when he said,
Don't make an idol of me
Don't make an idol of me
Don't make an idol of me
Plastic idols of me
Plaster idols of me
Don't make an idol of me

He said,
Well I walk the shores of Galilee
(Walk the shores of Galilee)
Where only the Spirit can talk to me

He said,
Well I walk the shores of Galilee
On the desert sands and no one can touch me
(Don't touch me no don't!)

Oh No
Oh No
Oh No
Oh No
What's this?
All these crimes
Committed in my name
Oh, well
