I refuse to sleep
I will not eat
i'm drowning in my bed
bind her hands to mine and make her blind
she's lost the rest of time
babe frothing at the teeth
carry him to me, his blood like cream
stars that fade away, the light will dissipate
and carve another name
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
just before I take you
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
just before I take you
paint your lips with blood
and clean your eyes
you've stripped away the skin
babe frothing at the teeth
carry him to me, his blood like cream
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
just before I take you
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
just before I take you
cancer of thinking
think you've been left behind(?)
all that your wasting
wasting away
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
just before I take you
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
just before I take you
