grab my face
as hard as it's funny to you
while i pretend
i'm your real dad
how is anne's cough today miss sheryl
i pretend to ask
a daughter who i bug
and can only stand to be around me for about 30 seconds
but whose picture i wear
in a pin inside my coat
so, who is this picture
that's you anne
you're not coming to my birthday
oh, i know
