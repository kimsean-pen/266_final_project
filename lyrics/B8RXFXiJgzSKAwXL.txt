A blue, black shade of love.
Sent from above.
My hands are tied
To worlds unknown
And this I know.
Your breath's like wine
And just like clouds
My skin crawls.
It's so divine
The sky it glows
With fields of light.

Did you know
That I love you?
Come and lay with me.
I love you.
And honesty
I love you.
You make me feel alive
And I'll love you

Until the end of time.

My hands shake clasped with fear
As you come near
To say goodnight
Just like a dove.
A peaceful sign.
To help us by
As you come in.
Let this begin.
Stars fall like dust

Our lips will touch.
We speak too much.

Did you know
That I love you?
Come and lay with me.
I love you.
And honesty
I love you.

You make me feel alive
And I'll love you
Until the end of time.

Did you know
That I love you?
Come and lay with me.
I love you.
And honesty

I love you.
You make me feel alive
And I'll love you
Until the end of time.

I've got a lot to say
If you will let me
It's always hard
When you're around me
But here right now
There's interest in your eyes
So hear me out
And hear this the first time
That I... love you
(come and lay with me)
I... love you
(and honesty)
I... love you
(you make me feel alive)
I... love you
Till the end of time
