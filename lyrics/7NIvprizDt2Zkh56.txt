I know you feel like you're the only one, like you've had enough
Like you should just give up, like you don't give a fuck.

But let me tell you my friends, that when it ends it just ends
There's no afterlife, you don't come back from death
But let me tell you my friends, that when it ends it just ends
There's no afterlife, you don't come back from death.

So when you leave this earth, when your heart stops you'll see
There's no choir of angels, there's no gods to meet.

You leave friends, you leave family, leave lovers, leave home.
Then you'll be on your own.
So let me tell you my friends, that when it ends it just ends
There's no afterlife, you don't come back from death.

So when you leave this earth, when your heart stops you'll see
There's no choir of angels, there's no gods to meet
No gods to meet!

There's no afterlife, you don't come back from death
Just know this my friend as you let go of hope
As you struggle with your life and grip tightly that rope.

So when you leave this earth, when your heart stops you'll see
There's no choir of angels, there's no gods to meet.
So when you leave this earth, when your heart stops you'll see
There's no choir of angels, there's no gods to meet.

There is love to be found if you'll just open your heart
There is light to be found when you are lost in the dark
There are people who'll listen and people who care
And I know this my friend because I too have been there!
There's no afterlife you don't come back from death.
