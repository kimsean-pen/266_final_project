You don't get these kisses for free

It's getting late, baby, your dinner's cold
I tried to call but, got your answer phone
Last thing that you said you were on your way back to me
I can tell you think there's nothing wrong
What's with the haircut and the new cologne?
Lipstick on your shirt, so don't make it worse lying to me

Now watch me set the tone
You'll be sleeping in the bed alone
Little boy, you better run along
Don't want to make me sorry
Can't you see you ain't making a fool of me?
It's insanity, you better run ooh

You don't get these kisses for free
See, I've got two sides of me, boy
The one you want your mother to meet
And the one that's a freak, boy
No, I can't be tamed, make you scream my name
I ain't playing games no more, so
You don't get these kisses for free
I pray that you never meet, boy

Listen to me, now, it's critical
You don't want to wake this a-a-animal
Get your story straight, I can't wait all night for sure

Now watch me set the tone
You'll be sleeping in the bed alone
Little boy, you better run along
Don't want to make me sorry
Can't you see you ain't making a fool of me?
It's insanity, you better run ooh

You don't get these kisses for free
See, I've got two sides of me, boy
The one you want your mother to meet
And the one that's a freak, boy
No, I can't be tamed, make you scream my name
I ain't playing games no more, so
You don't get these kisses for free
I pray that you never meet, boy

I won't forgive you for your mistakes
Don't try to turn this around, boy, it's too late
You know I won't forgive you for your mistakes
Don't try to turn this around, boy, it's too late
There's emotions you ain't seen
Be your nightmare or your queen
Go 'head, bad boy, live your dream
Don't come crawling back to me

You don't get these kisses for free
See, I've got two sides of me, boy
The one you want your mother to meet
And the one that's a freak, boy
No, I can't be tamed, make you scream my name
I ain't playing games no more, so
You don't get these kisses for free
I pray that you never meet, boy
