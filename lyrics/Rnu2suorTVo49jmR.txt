Save your breath, don't say you care
I'm dumb, I'm deaf
You broke me there
Of all I've known, our pain is real
But I try to hold the hand you deal
Though I sleep alone, I don't walk alone
And I've come to know what I need

And I don't grow these days
There's something in my way
But I don't try to wait
There's nothing in my day
That I wanna replace

I'm scared to know how long I'll love
The time I've seen you rise above
Though I sleep alone, I don't walk alone
And I've come to know what I need

And I don't grow these days
There's something in my way
But I don't try to wait
There's nothing in my day

And I don't grow these days
There's something in my way
But I don't try to wait
There's nothing in my day
That I wanna replace
