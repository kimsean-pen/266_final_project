If I go, a million miles away
I'd write a letter, each and everyday
'Cause honey nothing, nothing can ever change this love I have for you

Mmmmmm, make me weep
And you can make me cry
See me coming
And you can pass me by
But honey, nothing, nothing can ever change this love I have for you

Wo-oh-oh, you're the apple of my eye, you're cherry pie
And oh you're, you're cake and ice cream
Oh you're sugar and spice, and everything nice
You're the girl of my, my, my, my, dreams

But if you wanted, to leave me and roam
When you got back, I'd just say welcome home
'Cause honey nothing, nothing, nothing can ever change this, love I have, for you
Wo-oh-oh-oh...

(Musical Interlude)

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know that nothing, nothing, nothing can ever
Change the love I have for you.
