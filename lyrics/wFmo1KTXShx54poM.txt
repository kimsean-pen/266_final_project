Love me, love me; say you do.
Let me fly away with you.
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind.
Give me more than one caress;
Satisfy this hungriness.
Let the wind blow through your heart,
For wild is the wind.

You touch me;
I hear the sound of mandolins.
You kiss me,
And, with the kiss, the world begins.
You're spring to me, all things to me;
You're life itself!
Like a leaf clings to a tree,
Oh my darling, cling to me,
For we're creatures of the wind,
And wild is the wind, the wind.
Wild is my love for you.

Oh my darling, cling to me,
For we're creatures of the wind,
And wild is the wind, the wind.
Wild is my love for you.
