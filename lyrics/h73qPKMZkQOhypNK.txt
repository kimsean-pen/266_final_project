I met you we made a pact
Broke promises the system snaps
All your lies and neon lights are old

Dicta-coated miracles and then one day the curtain called
Behind your smile you're phony and a fake

Give it up
You've been discovered
Don't look back 'cos you've just lost your lover
Give it up
Your an illusion
Play our tricks and all I get is just confusion

And now we're through
The show is over
The audience is walking out the room
You know it's true, what I told ya
That all this junk comes back around on you

You said you were built to last
You took my hand you made a pass
The moon eclipsed and circled round my heart
With your kiss my life began
Your love it hit and then you ran
And I hope you pay your dues I'm moving on

Give it up
You've been discovered
Don't look back 'cos you've just lost your lover
Give it up
Your an illusion
Play our tricks and all I get is just confusion

And now we're through
The show is over
The audience is walking out the room
You know it's true, what I told ya
That all this junk comes back around on you

You might think I'm sitting home and crying
But I'm not, oh no
I've pulled the Queen of Clubs, there's no denying
I'm having the time of my life

And now we're through
The show is over
The audience is walking out the room
You know it's true, what I told ya
That all this junk comes back around on you

And now we're through
The show is over
The audience is walking out the room
You know it's true, what I told ya
That all this gunk comes back around
All this junk comes back around on you
