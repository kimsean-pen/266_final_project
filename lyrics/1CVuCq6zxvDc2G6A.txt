It's safe to say that no one is waiting for you
To draw your lifeline, and
One million voices are begging you to follow the lines,
And you keep on thinking that

We're all falling down or wasting our time,
If we're chasing our childhood dreams,
Where's the glory?
If there's nothing to see!

There's not a storm in sight
There's nothing we can't fight,
But you gave up countless times.
There's no hope in your mind,
No dream of a lifetime,
Only reasons to turn back.

You focus now on the comfort of your fate,
This fragile world that keeps you in this state.
You just look back on these fading memories,
Sitting alone, while hope keeps me singing:

"We're not falling down or wasting our time,
As we're chasing our childhood dreams,
Here's the glory!"

There's not a storm in sight
There's nothing we can't fight,
But you gave up countless times.
There's no hope in your mind,
No dream of a lifetime,
Only reasons to turn back.

My words ring in your head each and every day,
We're still oceans apart and miles away.
Now, you'd better forget what you leave behind,
This could be your last chance to make up your mind.
I can't get over it!
It's time for you to trust in yourself,
Drop your doubts!

There's not a storm in sight
There's nothing we can't fight,
But you gave up countless times.
There's no hope in your mind,
No dream of a lifetime,
Only reasons to turn back.
