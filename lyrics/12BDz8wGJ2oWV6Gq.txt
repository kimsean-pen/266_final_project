You are the guilding light,
Second star on the right
That will help us get back home
Just take my hand, trust in me, with the happiest of dreams
So I need to know if you believe
Fly with me to a place where we can be together
Woah!
And will you sing me to sleep tonight?
Cause I know you're all alone
And I need a home to come home to.
"Never grow up! I'll never grow up!" she said
"Never show up, never show up at her window,
But I can't help myself.
You thought you'd need me to fly away,
When the trust is I need you.
Fly with me to a place where we can be together
Woah!
And will you sing me to sleep tonight?
Cause I know you're all alone
A I need a home to come home to.
Don't you fall asleep, I need you here.
I've lost my everything.
Don't you fall asleep, don't you fall asleep
So don't fall asleep, I need you here.
I've lost my shadow.
I've lost my way.
(I've lost my shadow)
So don't fall asleep, I need you here.
(Don't you fall asleep)
I've lost my shadow.
I've lost my way.
(You were my only chance to fly)
Fly with me to a place where we can be together
Woah!
And will you sing me to sleep tonight?
Cause I know you're all alone
A I need a home to come home to.
I've found my shadow and
I'm finally free!
(Finally)
I'm finally
