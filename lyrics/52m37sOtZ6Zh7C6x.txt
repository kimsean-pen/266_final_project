thought it'd be cool if we didn't have to all the time
didn't know what i would be missing
there's a lot to take in
i lost track of time
thought i could fix it
i was mistaken
and now you always have me looking at your back so far behind
i know there's a thing that we've never done
i know we should talk but i'm so tired

have you ever seen me as a god
ripped jeans when i'm at the mall
i dream and it comes to me
then wake and nothing at all
i dream of a cemetery back to you and my heart beats on and off
i'm checking in for my sake and i
i really want to talk so just help me

baby i'm on your bad side
but i've got ideas for changing your mind

physically i'm reaching out to you and all the time
she says she's forsaken
maybe she is
but then so am i

you're a young light sleeper on the edge of the bed
and i'm so sedated that i sleep through the night
do you remember in the pool
body's crashing into you
realities a secret and i
i really want to talk but i'm so alone

baby i'm on your bad side...
