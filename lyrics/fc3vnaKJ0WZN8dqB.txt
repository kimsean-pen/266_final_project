Oh, when I said I need you so much
I was dead,
I was alive when you were right here by my side,
We both could see
that I needed you, you needed me,
And now we both regret,
Regret what we said.

So whose fault is it anyway,
Don't say,

We both know that we made a mistake,

Well, that's what they say,
We still regret what we said,
What we said.
