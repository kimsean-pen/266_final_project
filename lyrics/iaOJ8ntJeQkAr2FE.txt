I could have tamed you, I could have shown
That I could depose you from your loud throne
But in the end, I wasn't good enough
I just showed the gems that I ain't got the stuff

Oh-oh, Wailing Stone!
I tried so hard to fly, but I was thrown
Oh-oh, Wailing Stone!
I gotta tell the gems 'cause they should know

Have a little, have a little, have a little faith in me!
I just wanted to help. You know, I
Have a little, have a little, have a little expertise!

I know it's not much
But if it could come in handy, I'd wanna be there
I think so highly of you, it just isn't fair
That you have so little faith
