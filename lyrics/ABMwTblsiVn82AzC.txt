Amazing Grace! how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
We have already come
'Tis grace that brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright, shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun

Amazing Grace! how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
