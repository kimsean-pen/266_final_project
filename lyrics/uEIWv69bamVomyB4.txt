I'm standing by the riverside
Dreaming: "Hope come save me now"
I'm feeling like I can't escape
Screaming: "Love, come pull me out"

All this darkness inside me? Well, I'm the creator
All this loneliness I feel? I'm the creator
The Earth heaves inside of me, and there's a forest set to light
So this passion can burn, burn like a forest fire
It burns, burns like a forest fire
Lost in a winter's storm like wolves with no stars to use as guides

But we're still breathing, and we're the lucky ones
The weeping willows on the banks where the rivers used to run
So still sway with the breeze, but don't fall down to your knees
Hope come save me now

I'm standing by the riverside
And I'm dreaming: "Hope come save me now"
I'm feeling like I can't escape
And I'm screaming: "Love, come pull me out"

We have lived in the shadows now for far too fucking long
Pull the wool from your eyes, tear the darkness away
We won't exist underground for the rest of our days

But we're still breathing, and we're the lucky ones
The weeping willows on the banks where the rivers used to run
So still sway with the breeze, but don't fall down to your knees
Hope come save me now

I'm standing by the riverside
And I'm dreaming: "Hope come save me now"
I'm feeling like I can't escape
And I'm screaming: "Love, come pull me out"
I'm standing by the riverside
And I'm dreaming: "Hope come save me now"
I'm feeling like I can't escape
And I'm screaming: "Love, come pull me out"

All this darkness inside me? Well, I'm the creator
All this loneliness I feel? I'm the creator
The Earth heaves inside of me and there's a forest set to light
So this passion can burn, burn like a forest fire
It burns, burns like a forest fire
It burn, burn like a forest fire
It burns, burns like a forest fire
