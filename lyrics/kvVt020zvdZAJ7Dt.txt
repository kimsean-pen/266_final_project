Strange vibe
circles round
Tries to comfort
buzzing sound
Form an arrow
point at us
We the target
are the one
Drop yourself
in the grass
Breathe the air
at last
Hold on tight
Don't fall down
Breathe the air
through the water
Form an arrow
point at us
We the target
are the one
Place your bet
on the best
The fastest horse
you can find
Drop yourself
in the grass
Breathe the air
at last
Hold on tight
Don't fall down
Breathe the air
through the water
