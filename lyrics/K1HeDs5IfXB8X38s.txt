Oh, when you call my name
Oh, when you call my name

I was a rebel even as a little girl
I've been a loner ever since I can remember
I taste my hair because it wouldn't be in curls
I'm over-strengthened days and I shook these pretenders

Oh, when you call my name
Oh, when you call my name
Oh, when you call my name
I'll be waiting on the border, baby

Oh, when you call my name
Oh, when you call my name
I'll be two steps over the water, baby
Oh, when you call my name

I got my vertigo from looking from above
I found a loophole having not become a member
I took the u-turn wasn't shaken kind of stirred
And if you see that kid there's no need to defend her
And even though I'm just a second from the blues
Always remember when he start to flash my jaw-bone
It's now or never cause a crook had read the news
I'm walking on the water shining like a rhinestone

Oh, when you call my name
Oh, when you call my name

Oh, when you call my name
I'll be waiting on the border, baby
Oh, when you call my name

Oh, when you call my name
I'll be two steps over the water, baby
Oh, when you call my name

I'll be waiting
This ain't over

I'll be waiting
This ain't over

I'll be waiting
This ain't over

I'll be two steps, two steps
I'll be two steps over

I'll be two steps, two steps
I'll be two steps over

Oh, when you call my name
Oh, when you call my name

Oh, when you call my name
I'll be waiting on the border, baby
Oh, when you call my name

Oh, when you call my name
I'll be two steps over the water, baby
Oh, when you call my name

Over mountains, cross the water
I'll be waiting
This ain't over
