Come close to me, promise everything, don't tell a soul, let's just begin
Stiletto tied and bound to me, the sound of silk and skin to skin
A close embrace, a lusting grin, entangled in a web of lust and sin
A kiss of death, the speed of sound, you've come to take my innocence

Don't hesitate, your gift sets me free
And the biting feeds the lust in me

No thanks to this state of undress, you drag me in hand on my chest
The beat of life will satisfy, poison lips I won't deny
A close embrace, a lusting grin, entangled in a web of lust and sin
A kiss of death, the speed of sound

Do you feel the beat of life?
Forgive me, oh won't you forgive me?

Don't hesitate, your gift sets me free
And the biting feeds the lust in me
You're slipping through my fingertips
You bring me to my knees
It's over and I'm cold

In this fine allure, keep it to yourself
I need your love
In this fine allure, the biting feeds
A lusting, beating heart
I trust in you and carelessly strip you down
Living, living by the words l'amour
Playing by the rules no more
Living by the words l'amour, l'amour, l'amour
Dangerous eyes, tempting sighs
Keep them to yourself

Strip me down!!!

You're so warm and slipping through my fingertips
You bring me to my knees
It's over now

And I won't hesitate, your gift sets me free
And the biting feeds the lust in me.
