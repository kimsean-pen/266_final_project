All of my love, all of my love
All I have to offer you is all of my love
It's not enough, it's not enough
It's all I even have and
It just isn't enough

My own heart is not my own
It belongs to you alone
I guess I'm just out of luck
'Cause you deserve everything
On the earth and above
But all I have to offer you is all of my love
All of my love

All of my love, all of my love
All I had to offer you was all of my love
Just not enough, just not enough
I gave you all I had but
It was just not enough

You're the only one for me
How could any other be?
Well, I guess I'm totally fucked
'Cause you deserve everything
On the earth and above
And all I have to offer you
Is all of my love

You know I miss you like the sun
And you know I don't have
Anyone at all anymore
I wish that you would come back to me
But I know that it's only a dream

My own heart is not my own
It belongs to you alone
I guess I'm just out of luck
'Cause you deserve everything
On the earth and above
But all I have to offer you is all of my love
All of my love
