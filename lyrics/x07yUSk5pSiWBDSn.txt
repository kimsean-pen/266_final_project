The day you went away
You had to screw me over
I guess you didn't know
all the stuff you left me with
is way too much to handle
But I guess you don't care

You don't need to preach
you don't have to love me, all the time

Whatever on earth possessed you
to make this bold decision
I guess you don't need me
While whispering those words
I cried like a baby
hoping you would care

You don't need to preach
you don't have to love me, all the time
You don't have to preach all the time
You don't need all the time
You don't need all
You don't need to preach
you don't have to love me, all the time
You don't need to preach
you don't have to love me, all the time
You don't need to preach
you don't have to love me, all the time
You don't need to preach all the time
