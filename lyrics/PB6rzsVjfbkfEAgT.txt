I might be wrong
To feel this way
You've got to know
It wasn't physical
The way you make
Me feel alive
I want this love
It wasn't typical

It wasn't typical
I've seen it all, you might not wanna know about it
Like I'm a criminal
When I was cynical
I never thought I'd feel this way when I'm without it
But when you're not here I know

I've been a victim of emotion
I saw a side I never meant to see
I'm gonna say it if you don't know
You are everything to me
Ooh come on, I'm never looking back again
You are everything to me
Ooh I told you that we're never going back again
You are everything to me

It won't be long
To figure out
But I believe
That it's reciprocal
I picked you up
I turned you on
I made you know
It's unconditional

It's unconditional
I've seen it all you might not wanna know about it
Like I'm a criminal
When I was cynical
I never thought I'd feel this way when I'm without it
But when you're not here I know

Did we try to break it
Will we fall (Will we fall)
I don't want to regret
Gave you all
Do we get to make it
Will we go (Will we go)
Do this all the week yeah
Do you know

(Did we try to break it)
Ooh come over, I'm never looking back again
(I don't want to regret)
You are everything to me
(Do we get to make it)
Ooh I told you that we're never going back again
(Do this all the week yeah)
You are everything to me
