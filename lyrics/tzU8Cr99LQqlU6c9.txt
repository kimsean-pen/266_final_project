(Don't come knocking outside my door)
(Na, ah, na, ah, na)

Does it make you feel so big and strong
Every time you scream and shout
Or is it just that you get something off seeing me broken down
Think you got me under your arm
You got it all wrong
So tell me tell me to be alone now
Locked up, out in the cold now

Now you wanna buy me diamonds
And you wanna send me roses
But you know that the door for redemption
Is closed for ever, ever, yeah

Don't come around here no more
Na, ah, na, ah, na
Don't come knocking outside my door
Na, ah, na, ah, na
You can find another way to get back in
But you're not gonna break this heart again
So no don't come around here no more
Na, ah, na, ah, na

Does it make you feel like a man
When you throw those words at me
You never thought I'd pick them up off the ground
And shove them back in your face
You hate that I never was afraid
But sorry you can't get away
See only little boys like to fool like you
But I think its time you grow up too now

Now you wanna buy me diamonds
And you wanna send me roses
But you know that the door for redemption
Is closed for ever, ever, yeah

Don't come around here no more
Na, ah, na, ah, na
Don't come knocking outside my door
Na, ah, na, ah, na
You can find another way to get back in
But you're not gonna break this heart again
So, no, don't come around here no more
Na, ah, na, ah, na

Now you can cry me, cry me, cry me
Cry me a river of your drowning
And so many time I tried, now it's good bye
So you better let it sink in
Now you can cry me, cry me, cry me
Cry me a river of your drowning
And so many time I tried, now it's good bye
So you better let it sink in

Don't come around here no more
Na, ah, na, ah, na
Don't come knocking outside my door
Na, ah, na, ah, na
You can find another way to get back in
But you're not gonna break this heart again
So, no, don't come around here no more
Na, ah, na, ah, na
