Yeah, yeah
Last night, what was going on?
Hold tight, only just begun
All out, load the party guns
We're the only ones
Ready go, gone

Face down, wake up somewhere new
Spaced out, barely made it through
Every time I get into, whatever we do
Yeah, I'm with you

So if you had enough
Dust your shoulders off
And we can kick it till the nights get enough of us
And if you didn't know, I should tell you so
And now you know

Don't matter what they say
'Cause we be killin' it, killin' it, killin' it, all the way, way
Okay
Yeah, we be killin' it, killin' it, killin' it, all the way, way

Rewind, where we started out
Play back, all that we forgot
You, me, all the shit we got
Love it at the top, ready get hot

Wild hearts making our mistakes
Switched on but we're never fazed
Get down, we don't play it safe
Go out on a blaze, live for the day

So have you had enough
Dust your shoulders off
And we can kick it till the nights get enough of us
And if you didn't know, I should tell you so
And now you know

Don't matter what they say
'Cause we be killin' it, killin' it, killin' it, all the way, way
Okay
Yeah, we be killin' it, killin' it, killin' it, all the way, way

Shit, you wanna get with this
We up to brand new tricks, so boy, get down to me
Shit, we on some chronic shit
You know that this is it, why don't you come and play?
