OLVIDA A LA OTRA WNA KE TAI COMO AWEONAO
CON RESPETO: Mati Samu Nicol Gaby Aron

Been working all the week
I ain't got no time to sleep

I got plenty when I die on the ride
The night has just begun
Are you ready, here I come
I'll be dancing 'til the morning light

I come alive when the sun comes down
The city noise makes a beautiful sound
Loose all control, going all in tonight
(loose all control, going all in tonight)
So put your hands up
Hands up
You know you can't stop
Can't stop
So put your hands up
Hands up
Wooh ooh ooh
So put your hands up
Hands up
'cuz we can't get enough
Get enough

So put your hands up

Hands up
Wooh ooh ooh
Now will you dance with me
We're gonna live it up
Bring it up
No matter what
You know there's no way but up
Right now

So put the needle on the record

The world is looking better
When we're spinning round and round
We come alive to the neon light
Turn the music up 'cuz the feeling's alright

Hold back the door,
No we can't stop now
Can't stop now now now now now now
So put your hands up
Hands up
You know you can't stop
Can't stop
So put your hands up

Hands up
Wooh ooh ooh
We come alive when
The sun comes down

The city night's maze

Beautiful sounds
Come on and dance with me
So put your hands up
Hands up
You know you can't stop
Can't stop
So put your hands up
Hands up
Wooh ooh ooh
Just put your hands up
Hands up
'cuz we can't get enough
Get enough
So put your hands up
Hands up
Wooh ooh ooh
Come on and dance with me
