You stayed awake
On the front porch
Waiting for sundown
Just staring at the clouds

Feels like the days are
Always getting longer
Your pain
It's all gone

What did you want to be
Eternal now
And after all this life
I don't know now

We stayed awake
Till the day dripped
Out of our heads
We drift into the dark

I find it hard just to wander
On through this life
Your pain
You're so far
