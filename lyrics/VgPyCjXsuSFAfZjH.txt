And my body goes, whoa, oh, oh,
everybody's starry eyed.
And everybody goes, everbody's starry eyed.
And my body goes, oh.

Next thing, we're touching.
Next thing, we're touching.

Oh, everybody's starry eyed.
And everybody goes, oh, and everbody's starry eyed.
My body goes, whoa oh,

And everybody goes, oh, and everbody's starry eyed.
And my body goes...
