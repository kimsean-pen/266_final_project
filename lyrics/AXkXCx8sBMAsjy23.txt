How can this be all
Keep my feet on solid ground
Forever biding
Watch me as I leave

Give me your time
Give me your space
Give me your heart
I don't know why it's going
To decide for us

Give me your time
Give me your space
Give me the entire human race
Give me your heart
Give your lie
I call this treason

I'm your substitute for your love
Hold me down now
I'm your substitute for your love

I'm your drug
I'm your heroin
The inside you're there
You'll let me in

I'm your substitute for your love

Hold me where you need me
I will be your slave
There's a necessary way
All the way

Give me your love
Give your heart
Hold me when you near
When you come around
I'll be your crutch
Cause there's no need to call me
I'll be waiting there

I'll be your one
I'll be over
I'll be your necessary there
How did it all
How did it all
It doesn't matter
Where did all go wrong

I'm your substitute for your love
Hold me down now
I'm your substitute for your love

I'm your drug
I'm your heroin
The inside you're there
You'll let me in

I'm your substitute for your love

I'm on my knees
I'm begging please
Won't you join me
I'll be the one for life

I'm your substitute for your love
Hold me down now
I'm your substitute for your love

I'm your drug
I'm your heroin
The inside you're there
You'll let me in

I'm your substitute for your love
I'm your substitute for your love
Hold me down now
I'm your substitute for your love

I'm your drug
I'm your heroin
The inside you're there
You'll let me in

I'm your substitute for your love
