"Leave your husband and come with me"
Said the Black Jack Gypsy Davy
Morningstar, tell no lie
While the goose is hanging high

Wring my neck under your thighs
All the world loves a surprise
Bright, terrifying and bizarre
Golden Lucifer, the Morningstar

Pull me up to see your face
What's it like to shit in space?
Morningstar, illuminate
Free us from this world of hate

I'm on a trip, but I don't slip
From out the fog comes a white ship
A lighthouse seen from afar
Saves the crew, O Morningstar

She shared some stories from her life
In slow Taboo like a prison knife
Morningstar, now I see

All your secrets are safe with me
Shitty songs, shitty art
Shitty poems, shitty hearts
To push away, I touch my scar
That reads your name, my Morningstar
