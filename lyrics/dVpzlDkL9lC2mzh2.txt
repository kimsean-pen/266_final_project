Music gets you girls
It's true
I can assure
I may not look like much
On the street
But once they hear me sing
Mission complete
If you're of average look
You've got to find another hook
For every twenty hours you invest
I guarantee an hour with the best
So get to work
My ugly friend
Find a guitar
And start a band
We all need love
Whatever works
The truth it hurts
Music gets you girls
The ones who are beautiful
And tall
They don't need to do
Anything at all
And who can blame them
It's not their fault
But the rest of us
Gotta hustle with charm
I used to work
At an office job
And let me tell you
The nights were long
Now I sing
And play guitar
And the world has opened
Legs and all
So get to work
My ugly friend
Find a guitar
And start a band
We all need love
Whatever works
The truth it hurts
Music gets you girls
The truth it hurts
Music gets you girls
