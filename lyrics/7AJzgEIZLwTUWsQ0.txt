The sand in my sheets
A day that came before
When it's gone, it leaves you wanting more
You cling to me
Like salt from the sea
So close and so sweet
Love, Crystalline

Don't let go
Don't let me go
Don't let go

Don't let go
Don't let me go
Don't let go

A hunger pushed aside
? will rise with passing time

You cling to me
Like salt from the sea
So close and so sweet
Love, Crystalline
