Tucked away from what
Makes the grass burn in the sun
Blue water in forests of love
What happens to the sky in the long Sunday night?
And if only I could know if I'm cold as ice
And if only I could see you after I die
If Blue could be happiness then that's all I'd want
What a pretty Pink light shining east side
Of the bedroom on walls of White
When the five o'clock sunset steals all the light
I look at you and I want to cry
And if only I could tell everyone alive
That the light is real and the heart is right and it's
Not a lie
Well if only it was easy then who am I
To me I'm the space but to you I'm the inside
If Blue could be happiness then that's all I'd want
