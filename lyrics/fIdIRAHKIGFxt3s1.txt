Hey there honey, in your cut up jeans
Whatcha drinkin' I was thinkin' you could save a sip for me
I've been lookin' cross the party all night long
At you movin' your hips with your pretty lips singin' along to a country song
Climb on up here with me
In my truck cause if we
Don't go ridin' around
I'm gonna run my battery down so

If you're ready to roll girl, just let me know girl
I don't know who brought you here and he left you alone
But he ain't worth the time you're spendin'
Textin' him on the phone girl
It's time to move on girl,
I got a radio and a shotgun seat
And it's gettin' late
It's time for me to take you home girl

It's alright if you live way out
I got enough gas to take you all over this town yeah
When we pull in the drive, I'll walk you up to the door
I'm a good guy girl, I'll settle for a kiss on the porch unless you want one more
Now he ain't payin' no attention
Don't know what he's missin'
So baby what do ya say
Why don't you just walk this way

When you're ready to roll girl
Just let me know girl
I don't know who brought you here and he left you alone
But he ain't worth the time you're spending textin' him on the phone
It's time to move on girl
I got a radio and a shotgun seat
And it's getting late
It's time to take you home girl

Come on let's go girl

So when you're ready to roll girl
We can take it nice and slow girl
Might even find a place to park
Sit there and watch the stars
Put on a show girl
Hey I don't know girl
I got a radio and a shotgun seat
And it's getting late
It's time for me to take you home girl
You can be my home girl
