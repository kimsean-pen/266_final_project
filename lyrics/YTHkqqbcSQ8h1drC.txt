You'll find in time
The brightest flame will slowly die
And bear the darkest night
To rise
When everything that's meant to shine
Burns out before your eyes

Tonight
We're longing for daylight
Burning the same lie
To find the ghost of you and I
We're running from midnight
Dying to ignite
To find the ghost of you and I

Yeah, 'cause tonight
The fire that we hold inside
That once would burn so bright
Denied and buried by a thousand eyes
That fight to keep you blind

Tonight
We're longing for daylight
Burning the same lie
To find the ghost of you and I
We're running for midnight
Dying to ignite
To find the ghost of you and I

This was the day I feared the most
When all that's left inside is a memory and the ghost
Of everything we know
Yeah the memory of everything we know
And I already know

Tonight
We're longing for daylight
Burning the same lie
To find the ghost of you and I
We're longing for daylight
Burning the same lie
To find the ghost of you and I
We're running for midnight
Dying to ignite
To find the ghost of you and I
