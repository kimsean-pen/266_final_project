Are you leaving for the country
You say the city brings you down
Lately I have fallen behind
And watched the circus leaving town

Are you leaving for the country
I know a little country town
Where the dogs sleep out in the cold
And the flag pole's falling down

By and high
The whippoorwill flies
Spreads his wings and moves off into space
Do you feel like something ain't real
Let the spirit move you again
Are you leaving for the country
