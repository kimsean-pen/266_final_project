You can travel the world but you can't runaway
From the person you are in your heart
You can be who you want to be make us believe
In you keep all your light in the dark
If you're searching for truth
You must look in the mirror
And makes of what you can see
Just be, just be
They say learning to love yourself
Is the first step that you take
When you want to be real.
Flying on planes,
To exotic locations won't teach you how you really feel.
Face up to the fact,
That you are who you are
And nothing could change that belief.
Just be, Just be
'Cause now I know
It's not so far
To where I go
And I'm this far
Is this...
