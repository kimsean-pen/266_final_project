We are the underground
They know nothing of our sound
We are the underground
They know nothing of our sound

This one's for the pigs at the top
You know nothing of us
You know nothing of us
We're in the gutter singing
We won't give up
With our fingers crossed
Baptised in blood
Sick of watching with our mouths sewn shut

Raise the flag, sound alarms
Look at the state of me, you, us

Brainwashed...

Are you skeptic?
Born and bred, negative?
Are you dead set suffering?
Giving up?

Are you spoon fed?
Coughing up the ignorance?
Are you brain dead?
Loathing, pulling at teeth?

Kill or cure
This is new world torture
Kill or cure
This is new world torture

If we have to kill the living to live
Prescribe plague and clean our slates with disease
(We won't follow)
They'll lead us straight to the grave
(There's no sorrow)
Convinced the answer's in the dust and debris
This is new world torture

We're fighting fighting with fighting
Our unity is divided
This is the system declining on us
Put a nail in my coffin and light it up
Our condition is critical

Seamless as it was
Before the winter came
The trenches will shelter our young
While we ration, others save

We came paired for the worst
Frantic, out of luck
Chosen by our tragedies
To make the best of us
To make the best of us
