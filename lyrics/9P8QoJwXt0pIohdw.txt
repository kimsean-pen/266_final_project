Dominoes Falling
Riot in the streets
Baby this time
there's no retreat
there's no surrender
A devil is rising
a shadow from the past
feeding the flames with fire
on the edge of fury.
Out of time.
Runing in and out of time.
Hear the ticking of the
countdown clocks tonight.
Girl we need some
Girl we need some
Action!
If we re gonna make it like a true survivor
We need some
Action!
If we wanna take our love away from here
We need a
living passion
to belive in
Burning hearts
and a brand new feeling.
Action!
If we re gonna make it like a true survivor.
Wo oooh.
Crawling from the ashes
The phoenix rise again
Fighting for life
For good
For all that we belive in
Girl we need some
Girl we need some
Action!
If we re gonna make it like a true survivor
We need some
Action!
If we wanna take our love away from here
We need a
Living passion
To belive in
Burning hearts
and a brand new feeling
Action!
If we re gonna make it like a true survivor
The hero stands alone
When all is said and done
the enemies have fallen
one by one
Out of time
Running in and out of time
Hear the ticking of the
countdown clocks tonight
Girl we need
Girl we need some
Actiooooooaaaaaaaaeeeeeooooouh.
Action!
Woooaw
Action!
If we re gonna make it like a true survivor
We need some
Action!
Action
If we wanna take our love away from here
We need a
living passion
to belive in
burning hearts
and a brand new felling
If we re gonna make it like a true survivor
True survivor
