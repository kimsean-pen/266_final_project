the same hair color, the same tattoos
you've got unlimited resources or nothing to lose
you make a choice and you were always afraid of dying
and i know i've been distant and i've filled you with doubt
but i've been heartbroken and i figured out
we all make a choice and i've never been afraid of dying

but its fine because i'm already hardly alive
and keep on holding on, hostile or withdrawn
its our will, our way, live through it everyday
and i don't really care to stop it because we've
brought it all on ourselves for so long
and it helps us to remain valiant

harboring affection, you pull me in too deep
just for female attention or some form of relief
and we'll just come back, we're always ashamed of trying
its all so familiar, all of this pent-up regret
behind last night's mascara and 10 dollar bets
that you knew you'd lose, but you've never been ashamed of trying

the same apprehension, the same subtlety
its been 3 years and you still tread on me
its not a choice, its a struggle to stay conscious
some romantic metaphor, its an uncanny sign
baby, i'll be your muse if you'll always be mine
we spell it out in incoherent love songs
