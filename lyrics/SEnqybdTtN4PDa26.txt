Take a look around me
Taking pages from a magazine
Been looking for the answer
Ever since we were seventeen

You know the truth can be a weapon
To fight this world of ill intentions
A new answer to the same question
How many times will you learn the same lesson?

I think they got it all wrong
We just got to hold on
And on, and on, and on

Cause we're gonna be legends
Gonna get their attention
What we're doing here ain't just scary
It's about to be legendary
Yeah we're gonna be legends
Gonna teach 'em all a lesson
Got this feeling in our souls we carry
It's about to be legendary

This is what we came for
And we couldn't want it anymore
Could never turn back now
Got to leave it all on the floor

Been dreaming of the payoff
Through the struggles and the trade-offs
Write in truth heading on the way up
Tell them the truth but they think it's just made up

I think they got it all wrong
We just got to hold on
And on, and on, and on

Cause we're gonna be legends
Gonna get their attention
What we're doing here ain't just scary
It's about to be legendary
Yeah we're gonna be legends
Gonna teach 'em all a lesson
Got this feeling in our souls we carry
It's about to be legendary

Eventually they're gonna know who's right
To make a stand you got to win the fight
Can't stand the heat then just stay out the light
For you might never make it out alive
You gotta live without a compromise
Let everybody hear your battle cry

Yeah we're gonna be legends
Gonna get their attention
What we're doing here ain't just scary
It's about to be legendary
Yeah we're gonna be legends
Gonna teach 'em all a lesson
Got this feeling in our souls we carry
It's about to be legendary
Hey
Ho ho
(Legends)
Mmmm legends
