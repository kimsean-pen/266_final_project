I used to be the son or the daughter of
the last name Charlotte
Nows I'm humbug and I'm harlot
Harmless monster with flowers in your hair
By the roadside, in the nighttime
I'm hardly even there
A blowy sudden change of color
It's your eyes who deceive you
I was an angel, someone's sweet thing
With flowers in my hair
Round the corner, flash of silver
And it's alright to recognize me
It's alright to recognize me
Call out my nameless
It's alright to recognize me, call out my nameless
It's alright to recognize me, call out my nameless
It's alright to recognize me, call out my nameless
It's alright to recognize me, call out my nameless

Graveless diggress... That's me
