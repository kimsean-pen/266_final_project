It started all in early September
When my God given little became a lot older
All goodbyes seal my broken heart
Hold on to your teardrops, you got a long way to go

Did you get older doing nothing today?
Don't you wanna stop complaining?
If one is easy then hard is two
No one knows where you're heading to
Once my private collection, always betting on you

No consolation prizes
Spit out your lies and chewing gum
Cut off your hair, yeah, that's it
If you look like that, I swear I'm gonna love you more

I thought about this for a long time
Never had the chance to try and make it better
My heart is waiting for a new you
And there's no other option on the schedule

Love like ours should never die with years
Once you start, you can't ever go backwards
'Cause if dark is one then bright is two
No one knows where we're heading to
No matter what it takes, never give up on you

Oh, I want you to change it all
I am gonna make it better

No consolation prizes
Spit out your lies and chewing gum
Cut off your hair, yeah, that's it
If you look like that I swear I'm gonna love you more

No consolation prizes
Spit out your lies and chewing gum
Cut off your hair, yeah, that's it
If you look like that I swear I'm gonna love you more
More, more, more
