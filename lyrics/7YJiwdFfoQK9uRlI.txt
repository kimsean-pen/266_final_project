I see you in my sleep
In this sequence of dreams, you are here with me
I see you in my dreams
In this sequence of dreams, you are here with me
In this sequence of dreams, you are with me here

It's unlikely to meet and share a dream, If I'm sleeping while you're awake
But when I think of you for strength, in dreams you reappear
And you are here with me, in this sequence of dreams you are with me here

I see you in my sleep
In this sequence of dreams, you are here with me
I see you in my dreams
