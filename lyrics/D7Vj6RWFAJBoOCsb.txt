Dark night nothing to see
Invisible hand in front of me
Scared to death there's someone near
Scared to move but you can't stay here

You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, the snakebite kiss
Devil's grip, the Iron Fist

Flying horse don't make a sound
Flying hooves don't touch the ground
Walk in circle lose your track
Can't go on but you can't go back

You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, you can't resist
Devil's grip, the Iron Fist

Moon eclipse and you know why
Ghost rider in the sky
Beast of evil devil's hound
Tooth and claw they pull you down
You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, the graveyard kiss
Devil's grip, the Iron Fist
