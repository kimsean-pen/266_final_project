Well my dear what long arms you have
All the better to hold you down.
Slap my wrists with that sweet consequence

What are we, what are we to do,
What are we, to do with you
What are we, what are we to do,
What are we, to do with you

I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say,
Who I am is quite enough (quite enough)
I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say,
Who I am is quite enough (quite enough)

Well my dear what deep roots you have (all the better to)
All the better to hold you down
We live inside your branches
Your family's nest asks
Boy where have you been
You don't know where I've been

What are we to, to do with you
What are we to, to do with you

I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say,
Who I am is quite enough (quite enough)
I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say,
Who I am is quite enough (quite enough)

Don't know where I've been
Don't know where I've been

Well my dear what long arms you have
All the better to hold you down

I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say,
Who I am is quite enough (quite enough)
I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say,
Who I am is quite enough (quite enough)

Cause you don't know where I've been
No you don't know where I've been
You don't know where I've been
You don't know where, you don't know where no.

I am, I'm ready to be new again (new again)
I'm ready to hear you say,
Who I am is quite enough
Well I am, I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say,
Who I am is quite enough (quite enough)
