Swing swing Up and down
Turn turn turn around
Round Round and Roundabout
And over again
Gun gun Son of a Gun
You are the only one
And no one else
Will take my place

The sun shines in the bedroom
When you play
And the raining always starts
When you go away (x2)

Swing swing up and down
Turn turn turn around
Round round and round about
And over again
Gun gun Son of a Gun
You are the only one
And no one else
Will take my place

The sun shines in the bedroom
When you play
And the raining always starts
When you go away (x2)

Swing swing up and down
Turn turn turn around
Round Round and Roundabout
And over again
Gun gun Son of a Gun
You are the only one
And no one else
Will take my place

The sun shines in the bedroom
When you play
And the raining always starts
When you go away (Repeat x6)
