Here I am, staring at the walls again
Another useless night, just waiting for the fucking end
I'm tired of living like a ghost
Always searching for the light
They say that it eases with time
But this sinking feeling will always be mine
Will always be mine

Tear my heart out
I'll never be the same
I can feel my world crashing down
And I only have myself to blame
I'm a letdown, I'm a failure
And it's bleeding me dry
I can feel my world crashing down
And I only have myself to blame

When I hit rock bottom, it won't seem so wrong (Won't seem so wrong)
After everything I've been through, it won't be too long
I'll bury my bones in the deepest of sand
I'll begin to scatter my ashes with my very own hand

When the weight of the world crashes down on me
Hatred courses through my veins
All the self-doubt that I have inside, it still remains
When it's all said and done
I am nothing

Tear my heart out
I'll never be the same
I can feel my world crashing down
And I only have myself to blame
I'm a letdown, I'm a failure
And it's bleeding me dry
I can feel my world crashing down
And I only have myself to blame

A question that always stays
What's the point of being positive?
I'm a mess and there's nothing else I can give
Free me from this life

All this pain still lingers like the
twist from a knife (Twist from a knife)
All this pain still lingers like the twist from a knife
All this pain still lingers like the
twist from a knife (Twist from a knife)
All this pain still lingers like the twist from a knife
