I could have met you in the water:
fins and tail, and you are Maldoror.
I could have met you in the water.
I could have been the one that you searched for.

Eyes fixed and circling
circling

If you found me,
face to face and slicing through the waves,
pulling you into the sea.
"Do you really need to go home?", I'm a soul as lost as your own...
we were born of the undertow.
