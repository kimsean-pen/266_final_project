I heard you say*
. miles away
See the ...
They go long for miles
But you will never see the light again in his smile
Now you are gone now we are moving on
. they say ... got no heart ...
And you'll never 'hold me' in his arms again
And I heard you say
Almost take my breath away
You'll never 'hold me' in his arms again [Repeat:]
So cold
And I heard you say
Almost take my breath away
You'll never 'hold me' in his arms again [Repeat:]
So cold
