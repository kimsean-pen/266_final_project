I wanna say here's to me gonna change the world
And I wanna play till they're kicking down the door
And I'll be alright as long as I ain't seen it all
And I'm holding tight to that night we had a ball
We had a ball

Here's to the kids out there smoking in the streets
They're way too young but I'm way too old to preach
They know it all but they still ain't seen the truth
Just play my song and I'll show it all to you

Either way you caught me whilst a lying
You caught me whilst a lying
You caught me with my pants down

My pawpaw's slave had to go and fight the war
He beat them all and then he took them all to court
My pawpaw called and he said do you remember me?
Now he's working awful hard in his factory

Either way you caught me whilst a lying
You caught me whilst a lying
You caught me with my pants down

We ain't even been to the ocean
We've been running barefoot the stream
We've been running barefoot through the stream
We ain't even been to the ocean
