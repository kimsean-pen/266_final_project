We were cosmical beings.
Life was all around us
With no promise of eternity
With ups and downs

Few days and many nights
Of the second part of life
Another place, another time
It came like a tide

I woke up at night and walked
Life was flowing aroundme very slow Someone was
knocking at the door Who it was, I'll never know
