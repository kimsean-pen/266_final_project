On my roof
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold Case Love (love, love)
And I let you reach me one more time but that's enough, oh

Your love was breaking the law, but I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over it don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along, tell me how did we miss it

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime of a
Cold case love, oh-oh, oh-oh ohh

Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes couldn't see (no)
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Release me now cause I did my time
Of this cold case love (love, love)
My heart's no longer cold & confined
I've had enough, uh oh ohhh

Your love was breaking the law, but I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over it don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall (oh no)
Truth was there all along, tell me how did we miss it

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime of a
Cold case love, oh-oh, oh-oh ohh

We lost our way
Took this too far and I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along, ohh

Cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime of a
Cold case love we opened up a
Cold case love
And it got the be-est of us
And now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime of a
Cold case love, love
