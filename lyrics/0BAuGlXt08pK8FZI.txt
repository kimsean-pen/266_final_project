bright cinnamon smiles, a taste to remember
she was just seventeen and i wanted to have her
i'll say it this time, i can never be with you
and you see, i wish that i was dead
i want you forever and ever
i want you to, i don't want you, to come back

i see you're so sad, i see you tomorrow
it's insane to me can't you see oh
i want to be young, again i can feel
so much time, time to be what you want to do, i know
you say its for love, oh no
i don't believe, it i don't believe it i cant have you
