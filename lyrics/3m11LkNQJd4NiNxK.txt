One question, what can't be done?
You tear me down with the same thing
There's nothing, the end, it's begun
What can you do when it all drains?

Down, there you go, always
See if I care fading
Down, don't you know where I'll be?
'Cause I'm here, by my own

Waiting, when I'm waiting (don't you know?)
I've been here before, and I don't care where I'm going
So I'll stay

When you walk, don't leave a note
Just put your hands on the back door
When you talk, it's just a joke
Just know I can't take it anymore

Down, there you go, always
See if I care fading
Down, don't you know where I'll be?
'Cause I'm here, by my own

Waiting, when I'm waiting (don't you know?)
I've been here before, and I don't care where I'm going
So I'll be, waiting (waiting)
when I'm waiting (don't you know?)
I'll tell you once more
That as long as you're gone
Then I'll stay

Outside, there's no place I can hide
And your dead of time
Is anything alright?
When the wind tries
The storm won't subside
You'll be outside
I'm in here and I'll guard

Waiting, when I'm waiting (don't you know?)
I've been here before, and I don't care where I'm going
So I'll be, waiting (waiting)
When I'm waiting (don't you know?)
I'll tell you once more
That as long as you're gone
Then I'll stay

Then I'll stay
I missed it
And you'll go
Then I'll stay
Stay
