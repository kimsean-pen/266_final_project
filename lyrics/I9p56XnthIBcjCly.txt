You don't answer my call
With even a nod or a wink
But you gaze at your own reflection
You don't seem to see me
But I think you can see yourself
How can the mirror affect you?

Can you hear me?
Or do I surmise
That you fear me
Can you feel my temper
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise,
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise!

Do you hear or fear or
Do I smash the mirror?
Do you hear or fear or
Do I smash the mirror?
