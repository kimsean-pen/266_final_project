It's not goodnight
This is goodbye
I cannot promise
I'll see the light
I will miss you
With all my heart
I'll give you now
To tear apart

That I never want to be
Something is taking over me
There is anything for me
I'll take the bullet through my teeth

When you grieve
Do you believe
All your tears
Will summon me
By space around
That should be
With lungs of stone
I forgot to breathe

That I never want to be
Something is taking over me
There is anything for me
I'll take the bullet through my teeth

That I never want to be
Something is taking over me
There is anything for me
I'll take the bullet through my teeth
