Have you ever reached a rainbow's end
And did you find your pot of gold, mmm
Ever catch a shooting star
And tell me how high did you soar
Ever felt like you were dreaming
Just to find that you're awake
And the magic that surrounds you
Can lift you up and guide you on your way

I can see it in the stars across the sky
Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before
Now I finally realize
You see I've waited all my life
For this moment to arrive
And finally...
I believe!

When you look out in the distance
You see it never was that far
Ohh-no!
Heaven knows your existence
And leads you to be everything you are
Ohh!
There's a time for every soul to fly
It's in the eyes of every child
It's the hope, the love that saves the world
And, ohh, we should never let it go

I can see it in the stars across the sky (yeah-yeah-yeah)
Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before
Now I finally realize
You see I've waited all my life
For this moment to arrive
And finally...
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

I believe in the impossible
If I reach deep within my heart, yeah
Overcome any obstacle
Won't let this dream fall apart
See, I strive to be the very best
Shine my light for all to see
Cause anything is possible
When you believe...

I can see it in the stars across the sky (yeah-yeah-yeah)
(Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before)
Now I finally realize
You see I've waited all my life
For this moment to arrive
And finally...

I believe!
Woah-woah-yeah!
I believe!
Woah-woah-yeah-yeah!
