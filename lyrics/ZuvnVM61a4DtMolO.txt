Where's your father's name now?
It's every time you see me
Cause it's printed on a street sign that you see entering the city
You had a price tag
You thought letting materialistic concepts into the process
Wouldn't make a difference

I just had so much to say, but you don't want to hear it anyway
So I will sit and keep my mouth shut
You won't hear from me for months, or years, or I don't even care how long
Cause I don't want to think about you anymore

I was marking up your neck
My hips were locked between your knees
You were pulling me in
But your motives were selfish
I think you're bluffing again
Don't forget; I can see right through you
Your eyes are a window
I'm enjoying the view
Of your attention complex directing your heart again
If you had paid attention to context
You would see you only need me when
I was showing interest in something else
And I wasn't giving you what you were used to

I just had so much to say, but you don't want to hear it anyway
So I will sit and keep my mouth shut
You won't hear from me for months, or years, or I don't even care how long
Cause I don't want to think about you anymore

You kept me around
Cause it was easier than looking for someone else as a fallback
No heart inside
You wasted this life
Keeping this leash cause no one else wants you

You won't hear from me for months, or years, or I don't even care how long
Cause I don't want to think about you anymore
