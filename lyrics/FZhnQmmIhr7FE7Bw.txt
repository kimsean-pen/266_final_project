Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor some day.

Trouble in mind, it's true
I have almost lost lost my mind
Never had so much trouble

Trouble in my life before.

I'm gonna lay my head
On some lonesome railroad line

And let the 219 train
Ease my troubled mind
Trouble in mind
Yes, I'm blue

But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor someday

I'm gonna lay my head
On some lonesome railroad line
And let the 219 train
Ease my troubled mind.

Trouble in mind
Yes, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor someday

I'm gonna lay my head
On some lonesome railroad line
And let the 219 train
Ease my troubled mind.
Trouble in mind
Yes, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor someday
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor someday
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor someday
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor someday
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor someday
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor someday
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor someday...
