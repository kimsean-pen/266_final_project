I am an inconvenient thing
Able to see the good in everything else but myself.
I'd do my best to explain
If I had something that was clever to say -
But I don't. And I can't.

So do I sink or swim?
I'm drowning in the "what ifs" and "could have beens"
I'm not good enough for myself, let alone anyone else -
And that's just the way it is.
Yeah

And I'm still alone the way I was a year ago,
But it's better the devil you know instead of the devil you don't.
And I'm still alone the way I was a year ago,
But it's better the devil you know, you know than the devil
You don't
Than the devil
You don't

So do I sink or swim?
I'm drowning in the "what ifs" and "could have beens"
I'm not good enough for myself, let alone anyone else -
And that's just the way it is.
Yeah

So I'll just waste away
And worry about everything I cannot change.
Maybe I'm everything I hate.

Yeah
I guess I'm everything I hate.
Yeah
I became everything I hate.
Yeah
I'm simply everything I hate.
Yeah
O, God - I'm everything I hate.
Yeah
