It's a new day but it all feels old
It's a good life, that's what I'm told
But everything it all just feels the same
And my high school, it felt more to me
Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there it only made me see

That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna hear the words you say

And I don't ever wanna
I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
What I'm saying is this is the anthem
Throw all your hands up, you
Don't wanna be you

Go to college, a university
Get a real job, that's what they said to me
But I could never live the way they want
I'm gonna get by and just do my time
Out of step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind

Do you really wanna be like them?
Do you really wanna be another trend?
Do you wanna be part of that crowd?

'Cause I don't ever wanna
I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
What I'm saying is this is the anthem
Throw all your hands up, you
Don't wanna be you

Shake it once, that's fine
Shake it twice, that's okay
Shake it three times
You're playing with yourself again

You... don't wanna be just like you
What I'm saying is this is the anthem
Throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me, you
Don't wanna be just like you (don't wanna be just like you)
This is the anthem
Throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me
Another loser anthem
Another loser anthem
Another loser anthem
Another loser anthem
