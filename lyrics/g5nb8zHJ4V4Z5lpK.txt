You say there's so much you don't know
You need to go and find yourself
You say you'd rather be alone
'Cause you think you won't
Find it tied to someone else

Ooo, who said it's true
That the growing only
Happens on your own?
They don't know me and you

I don't think you have to leave
If to change is what you need
You can change right next to me
When you're high, I'll take the lows
You can ebb and I can flow
And we'll take it slow
And grow as we go
Grow as we go

You won't be the only one
I am unfinished, I've got
So much left to learn
I don't know how this river runs
But I'd like the company
Through every twist and turn

Ooo, who said it's true
That the growing only
Happens on your own?
They don't know me and you

You don't ever have to leave
If to change is
What you need
You can change
Right next to me
When you're high,
I'll take the lows
You can ebb and I can flow
And we'll take it slow

And grow as we go
Grow as we go
Grow as we go
Grow as we go

I don't know who
We'll become
I can't promise it's
Not written in the stars
But I believe that
When it's done
We're gonna see
That it was better
That we grew up together

Tell me you don't
Wanna leave
'Cause a change
Is what you need
You can change
Right next to me
When you're high,
I'll take the lows
You can ebb and
I can flow
And we'll take it slow
And grow as we go
Grow as we go
Grow as we go
Grow as we go
