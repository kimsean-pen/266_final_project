Hey, picture perfect, flawless figure, damn that bitch is hot
She's all the things you wish you were, but sadly you are not
The girls want to be her and the boys wish they could tap
That chick who is always up to something and isn't on the map
Hey, I heard she doesn't sweat, and I heard she doesn't drool
She's the girl that everybody knows is way too cool, hey, hey

When she walks through the halls it's like a swarm of flies
Nobody can seem to get enough of her green eyes
The girls want to be her and the boys wish they could tap
That chick who is always up something and isn't on the map
Hey I heard her mom is famous, I heard she does trapeze
She's the girl that everyone knows needs no charities, hey, hey, hey
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

When she walks down the street, they can't help but stare
But whenever she sees them, she doesn't seem to care
Those boys want to be her and the girls wish they could tap
That chick who's always up to something and isn't on the map
Hey, I heard she does karate, I heard she speaks Chinese
She's the girl that makes all the boys fall to their knees, hey, hey, hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
