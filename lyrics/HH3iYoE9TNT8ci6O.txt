I lost my words lingering in the dark
Hard times, don't you know we've seen them all
Ain't one to preach
Ain't one to speak on what I don't know
I lay that burden down
With one hand, we're reaching for the sky
And one hand, holding on for life
I won't raise my, I won't raise my white flag
In this life

The moment I surrender, bury me in the ground
I'd die before you see me take a bow
You know we all got, you know we all got
You know we all got a lot to lose
I won't surrender, praise the lord my soul to take
Thank God I live to die another day
You know we all got, you know we all got
You know we all got a lot to lose
I won't raise my white flag
'Till I'm through

I found my way following a trail of hurt
'Cause my name ain't no stranger to the dirt
It's been dragged around, it's been kicked around
They left it lyin' there for dead, whoa
But I defy before I lose the right
And take the time to watch the river rise
I won't raise my, I won't raise my white flag
In this life

The moment I surrender, bury me in the ground
I'd die before you see me take a bow
You know we all got, you know we all got
You know we all got a lot to lose
I won't surrender, praise the lord my soul to take
Thank God I live to die another day
You know we all got, you know we all got
You know we all got a lot to lose
I won't raise my white flag
'Till I'm through

I won't raise my, I won't raise my
I won't raise my white flag until I'm through
Until I'm through
Yeah

The moment I surrender, bury me in the ground
I'd die before you see me take a bow
You know we all got, you know we all got
You know we all got a lot to lose

I won't surrender, praise the lord but soul to take
Thank God I live to die another day
You know we all got, you know we all got
You know we all got a lot to lose
I won't raise my white flag, no
I won't raise my white flag 'til I'm through

I won't raise my, I won't raise my
I won't raise my white flag until I'm through

I won't raise my, I won't raise my
I won't raise my white flag until I'm through.
