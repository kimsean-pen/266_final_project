And so you come to serve me now in the concorde of your arms
I may rest for a while
May the past be a hazy shadow
Cause you may think it's done with you
I can't believe those grey eyes could ever be so blue
Turn the past to a hazy shadow
From where we exit our comfort zone
What is it good for

In that aspect I was childlike
They said because I couldn't see beginning nor end
But on this bed I ride the guilt trip
Knowing in full
That it's my own fault
But aren't we all childlike
I mean your crystal alp top dream of life in infinity amazes me
That you're afraid of something beyond today
Death walks behind you

I guess I've always been childlike that way
Cause you will hear me when I can't have my say
I have to keep from bargaining with some higher force to please extend my stay

But Why? I don't even like it here
And I do nothing but curse the very lot of you
I hate everything and everyone except for the chosen few
I often longed for this day

As your grip tightens you smother me with love
As good as it may feel
Suddenly I urge to break free and run
Watch me disappear, dissolve into thin air
I often longed for this day
But now I want to stay (and it's all because of you)

My body lingers, wants to fight
Knows nothing but to fight
Knows only how to stay

As your grip tightens you smother me with love
As good as it may feel
Suddenly I urge to break free and run
Watch me disappear, dissolve into thin air
I often longed for this day
But now I want to stay (and it's all because of you)

And as I draw my final breath
The world keeps spinning on like a worn out song from the 70s
Will it ever go off the air?
