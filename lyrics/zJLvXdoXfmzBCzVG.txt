Right here, right now
We're falling apart while were falling down
Who knew to hurt would feel this good

Move along so far from home
My mistakes go on and on
In truth I hate to be alone

It's in my blood and it's in my bones
In my heart and it's in my soul
And when I'm gone I hope you'll understand
When I get home I will make amends

When Tuesday comes I'll be gone again
And when I'm gone I hope you'll understand
(I hope you'll understand)

It's in my blood

I miss your touch and I miss your smile
The thing you do that drives me wild
But you know, it's the way it has to be

Another day and another round
I miss the friends in my hometown
But in truth it's the reason that I leave

It's in my blood and it's in my bones
In my heart and it's in my soul
And when I'm gone I hope you'll understand
When I get home I will make amends

When Tuesday comes I'll be gone again
And when I'm gone I hope you'll understand
(I hope you'll understand)

Would you love me the same if I never started dreamin'?
Are we better this way ever since I started leavin'?

It's in my blood and it's in my bones
In my heart and it's in my soul
And when I'm gone I hope you'll understand
When I get home I will make amends

When Tuesday comes I'll be gone again
And when I'm gone, I hope you'll understand
(I hope you'll understand)
