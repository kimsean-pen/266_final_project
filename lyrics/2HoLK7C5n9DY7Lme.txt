I am myself a reflection of something obscure
Pure, you can't reassure
Agonise, fantasise, hypnotise
Starving and I don't think I can get away

Outside your house (I'm dying)
Inside my internal cell
Trapped, nobody helped
Disregard my health
Paralysed and nobody will ever help

Just set me free
I'm living in fear
Just watch me bleed
Now just watch me bleed

Cut off the nerve
Neglected by your side
The lines may guide
But will never proceed
Thorns, in the vein, to the brain
Malicious intent
I'm tired of living in a fucking lie

Outside your house (I'm dying)
Inside my internal cell
Trapped, nobody helped
Disregard my health
Paralysed and nobody will ever help

Just set me free
I'm living in fear
Just watch me bleed
Now just watch me bleed
Just set me free
I'm living in fear
Just watch me bleed
Now just watch me bleed

An aggravated state of mind
Forever only passing by
And no one ever listened
An aggravated state of mind
Forever only passing by
And no one ever listened to me.
