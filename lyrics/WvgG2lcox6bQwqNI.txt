Come on, yeah

Well it's been seven years since that summer
Why'd you call me at all cause I'm with her now
You know you will have to get over
I finally forgot all those times somehow

Don't bring it all back to me
I know this is hard to see

You know the summer we smoked in the sun
You know it's only because we were young
And we promise to always remember
That we'd wind up together forever
Looking back, we should have some fun
A summer lost in the sun
Lost in the sun, yeah

No, I don't think it's right that I see you
Attempted to take it with her now
Get over me baby, you need to
If you don't we'll end up in a mess somehow

Don't bring it all back to me
I know this is hard to see

You know the summer we smoked in the sun
You know it's only because we were young
And we promise to always remember (remember)
That we'd wind up together forever (forever)

You know after all that was said it was done
You know we were living because we were young
And we promise we always remember
That we'd wind up together forever
Looking back, we should have some fun
Summer lost in the sun
Lost in the sun

I'm going under getting over you
I fooled myself by thinking we were through

Well it's been seven years since that summer
Why'd you call me at all cause I'm with her now
You know you will have to get over
I finally forgot all those times somehow

Looking back, we should have some fun,
Summer lost in the sun.
