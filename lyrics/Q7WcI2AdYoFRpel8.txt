What once was
Will be again
Closed eyes witnessing
A truth so worrying
No words can cure
Abeyance

Here,but not present
Never meant to stay

Closed eyes witnessing
A truth so worrying
No words can cure
Abeyance

A remnant of beyond
Forever drifting further
The vast journey away
From the dearest beheld
Watching from a distance
The looming unknown
Closed eyes witnessing
A truth so vile
Take me away
Let me escape from abeyance
From abeyance
