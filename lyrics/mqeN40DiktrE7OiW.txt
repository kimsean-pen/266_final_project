A thousand thundering thrills await me
Facing insurmountable odds greatly
The female of the species is more deadlier than the male

Shock, shock horror, horror, shock, shock horror
I'll shout myself hoarse for your supernatural force
The female of the species is more deadlier than the male

Oh, she deals in witchcraft
And one kiss and I'm zapped, oh

How can heaven hold a place for me
When a girl like you has cast her spell on me?
Oh, how can heaven hold a place for me
When a girl like you has cast her spell on me?

Frankenstein and Dracula have nothing on you
Jekyll and Hyde join the back of the queue
The female of the species is more deadlier than the male

For she wants to conquer the world completely
But first she'll conquer me discreetly
The female of the species is more deadlier than the male

Oh, she deals in witchcraft
And one kiss and I'm zapped, oh

How can heaven hold a place for me
When a girl like you has cast her spell on me?
Oh, how can heaven hold a place for me
When a girl like you has cast her spell on me?
Oh, how can heaven hold a place for me
When a girl like you has cast her spell on me?
Oh, how can heaven hold a place for me
When a girl like you has cast her spell on me?
