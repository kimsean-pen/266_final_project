Sparks might fly, in no time.
It's a delayed reaction of the third kind. (ooh)
I'm so ready for this.
Shrink-wrapped tones, I can face the music.
Stop matters bonding us way beyond
Our best by-days.

You know we've had it good, we've had it bad, so no hard feelings.
We've done all we could and all again. I'm done pretending.
Let's quit while we're still friends.

Making up stories that grew to be too tall,
My fortress to forget couldn't take anymore.
You nearly watched me ruin everything, everything!
There's a number one rule of don't-do's.
Well we knew it all too well.
You were supposed to be looking out for me!
Have you any idea how difficult it's been?

You know we've had it good, we've had it bad, so no hard feelings.
We've done all we could, and all again.
Let's save ourselves a sorry ending.
You know we've had it good, we've had it bad,
but this is as far as we can stretch.
Let's stop pretending, stop pretending
And quit while we're still friends

Well I was so young, misguided maybe.
But still this hands over my every pen to paper.
And this all started with a song.
Let this be our last one.
Drop, drop. Bridge, bridge!

We've had it good, we've had it bad, but this is as far as we can stretch.
Stop pretending!
And quit while we're still friends.

I wish you well.
I wish you well...
(I wish you well, wish you well, wish you well)

Wish you well, I wish you well, I won't tell if you won't tell.
I won't hold it against you if you bow out gracefully. (gracefully)
Can we just not drag this out, please?
I wish you well, I wish you well, I won't tell if you won't tell.
I won't hold it against you if you bow out gracefully, (do it gracefully!)
Can we just not drag this out?
