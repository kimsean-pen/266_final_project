I got a broken face, I got a...
I got a broken face, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, un-huh, ooh...
I got a broken face...
I got a broken face...
I got a broken face...

There was this boy who had two children with his sisters,
Who were his daughters, who were his favorite lovers.

I got no lips, I got no tongue,
Where there were eyes, there's only space.
I got no lips, I got no tongue.

I got a broken face, uh-huh, uh-huh...
I got a broken face...

There was this man who snapped his brain in little pieces,
And then they drilled holes, and then they put 'em back in there.

I got no lips, I got no tongue,
Where there were eyes, there's only space.
I got no lips, I got no tongue.

I got a broken face, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, ooh...
I got a broken face...

The little thing who does my laundry speaks no English,
But if you saw her, you'd say, "Isn't she lovely?"

I got no lips, I got no tongue,
Where there were eyes, there's only space.
I got no lips, I got no tongue.
