This last week
I slept eight hours total, I barely sleep
Maybe that's why I've been weak
The same things that plague you still plaguing me
God called you to fulfill a vacancy
I tried to see why it wasn't me

So I didn't show up to your funeral
But I showed up to your house
And I didn't move a muscle
I was quiet as a mouse
And I swore I saw you in there
But I was looking at myself

I'm placing bets against myself and honestly I'm a mess
Like a car engulfed in flames, I am a wreck
Things I should have said through call or text
I've just really been so busy and I regret
'Cause if there's no rest for the wicked
I'm as evil as it gets

So I didn't show up to your funeral
But I showed up to your house
And I didn't move a muscle
I was quiet as a mouse
And I swore I saw you in there
But I was looking at myself

So when you show up to my funeral
Will you be wearing white or black?
And I know the voice is in you
It's the energy I lack
So if there's a race to heaven
I will always come in last
And if there's a race to heaven
I will always come in last
