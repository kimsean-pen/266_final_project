I've been home all day
My husband's gone
They all say
He's got a girl on the side
While i stay home all day

So I make lemonade
Put on a dress and I go lay
Out in the day room
And I wait for you
To come on over
And give it to me

In the backyard full
Of dying flowers
In the kitchen on the
Pale pink counter
Give you a lap dance
Outside in a lawn chair
Drinking lemonade and
Playing with my hair

I've been home all day
My husband's gone
Don't need to worry
Take you upstairs
To the swan bed
Let you fuck me
Hard as you can

The next time he kisses me
I want him to taste red ruby lips
And the love we made
And the lemonade
So come on over
And give it to me

In the backyard full
Of dying flowers
In the kitchen on the
Pale pink counter
Give you a lap dance
Outside in a lawn chair
Drinking lemonade and
Playing with my hair
