And the lights behind your house won't feel the same
When you're allowed to see me
And the light on your garage is keeping you awake
And I hope you won't be sleeping anytime soon
Watch my shadow light up your room
You'll hear my voice soon

Don't feel rushed when you're thinking of what to say
We've got seventy-three more days
Anxious conversations are keeping us entertained
As we wait for the summer to finally break
Our doubts and disbeliefs keeping us up late

I'm staring out of the window
Wondering if you'll open yours when your parents fall asleep
Keep a secret I'll keep you in mind
Everything you know eventually works out in time
I'm staring out of the window
Wondering if you'll open yours when your parents fall asleep
Keep a secret I'll keep you in mind (Please fall asleep)
Everything you know eventually works out in time (Please fall asleep)
