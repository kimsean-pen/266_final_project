you had a dream about loss
within the fruit there are worms
yet still a vow to dare goodnight
you had a dream about love

could it be you were the one
who is waiting patiently for me
to disregard caution
to feign deafness to wisdom
could it be you were the one
who is waiting insanely for me
to bind your limbs stoutly
to feign deafness to protest

you ask unhurried by doom
the shot only bursts forth heat
bequeath a sigh if i would listen
you ask unhurried by love

could it be you were the one
who is waiting patiently for me
to stare blindly at forethought
to disregard caution
could it be you were the one
who is waiting insanely for me
to tweak your cheeks unsweetly
to insist on concession
