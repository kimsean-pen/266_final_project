Let's roll

In a village in the hills house buried to the window sills in snow
In a prison yard at night an Alsatian barking for the stars to go
In the attic of a house in the slats of light which creep across the room
In a forest grove at dawn where the animals sleep hidden in the gloom

On the 97th floor overlooking Tokyo
In Camden road in a second floor flat with dilworth down below

There is only one thing
There is only one thing

In a cancer ward where the patients sit waiting patiently to die
In an aeroplane high above the place you finally left behind
In a cage where only one thing could be free and it's not you and I
In a cage where only one thing could be free and it's not you and I

In every single place that has ever ever been
Hiroshima, Los Angeles and each town in between

There is only one thing
There is only one thing, one thing

In the darkest part of you that you have ever seen
In the smile of the child staring at the TV screen
In the diary of a priest in the sheets that lie upon his bed
Out there amongst the waves and inside your lover's head

There is only one thing
There is only one thing
There is only one thing
There is only one thing
There is only one thing
There is only one thing
There is only one thing

20 years asleep before we sleep forever
20 years asleep before we sleep forever
10 years on the coast figurin' out the weather
Another 10 years gettin' high until you're free
There's nothing after that but you and I
Nothing after that but you and me
20 years asleep before we sleep forever
20 years asleep before we sleep forever
