Try to make some changes really on the line
Given your religion, never ever time
All the jokers laughing, queens upon the floor
Mothers understand it, baby needs some more

Woh, held up to ransom, quick hand and a gun
Just your education, hard to understand
Will the teenage legend make a mark on you?
Make the big time status, a pen will let him through

Mother Mary would you ever really feel the same?
Could you try to understand a wild colonial boy?
