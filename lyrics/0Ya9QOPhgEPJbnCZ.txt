I wish we had chances to talk like this
a little more often
But you were always dealing with your girlfriend's shit
and I was always feeling broken over it

I like the way your hair looks in the sun
and when you're banging into everyone
I go to all your shows to watch you play
and afterwards I hang out only if you stay

I wish you never got your heart so broke
I wish you didn't sleep with her when you were drunk
I wish you didn't make out in your friend's bedroom
'Cause she won't ever love you like the way I do

And you deserve better but you think you don't
You deserve better than the one's you want
You deserve better yet you'll never see
You deserve better from someone like me...
