If you feel it do it
You don't need a reason
For all you know
It could be good for you

To show your feelings
Don't just leave them
Do the things you believe in, it's alright
Don't worry turn around, I will still be here

I'm not moving don't worry
You just try and push me out
No, I'm not moving
No, I'm not going anywhere tonight

If you think it, say it
'Cause no one can stop you
Don't keep quiet, just 'cos you think you ought to
Feel free to shout it out, speak your mind, spit it out

'Cause I'm not moving don't worry
Ah you just try and push me out
No, I'm not moving, nowhere.
Ah there's no hurry, I can sit it out
So don't worry turn around, I will still be here

If it hurts don't do it
'Cause no one can take you make you drink
And no one can tell you what you think
Remember if your spirit starts to sink
Don't you worry turn around, I will still be here
