I was scarred
from a rock
Slipping on the slopes of Mars
Lying in the cave
With the ants and bugs
Swattings blowflies
from around
my mouth
While the crickets croak
And my bowels
turn over to choke
Ripples reflect back on the waterfall

I'm distant
I dance in the shadows
Tryin' to find a distinction
Tunnelvision above and below

Indulging in this sonic turbulent
Feelin' lifting from inside my intestines
As my ears pop an' blow
And I'm overthrown
By gravity, vertigo
Turbines whistle and blow
Cause I let you go

Fiddling my thumbs
Always stop by months
Underneath this gruelling undertow But I know it's not his fault
I never asked for his insights on religious wisdom

To be preaching tunnel vision
To be seeking something different

Ambrose's freaking good armonica Solo

Alterations start fading
As the deadline comes-a racin'
We're all chasin' any kind of stimulation
Fit for this crystal generation
Tunnel vision
Loopholes in the system
Some might say he's a born again Christian
But know it's not his fault
I never asked for his insights on religious wisdom
Signs my own tunnel vision
To discover something was missing

Tunnel vision
Loopholes in the system
Some might say he's a born again Christian
But I know it's not his fault
I never asked for his religious wisdom
Preaching tunnel vision
Seeking something different?
