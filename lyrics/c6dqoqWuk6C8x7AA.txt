Someone to life like the magazines
Champagne popping right in limousines
It's never wrong to give it a try
But you can't have it all at the same time

I was young when I realised
Life would be easier without any ties
We are left to lose sometimes
There's nothing else to do but get high
Get high

Once you feel it
You need nothing
Feel my heart care
There must be something else
I can feel it
You keep me watching
You keep me watching, now

I wish I was with you now
And every time the sun goes down
'Gotta find a way somehow
To blank you out, blank you out

's far too late to love again
It's hard to take and to forget
'Gotta find a way somehow
To blank you out, blank you out

At the start, I was so eager to please
Fall in love before you know what it means
So many others leave it behind
But I never get used to goodbyes

It's been so long since I looked in her eyes
I lost the pictures but they stuck in my mind
And I never rehearse those lines
Yeah, I still put her first every time

Once you feel it
You need nothing
Feel my heart care
There must be something else
I can feel it
You keep me watching
You keep me watching, now

I wish I was with you now
And every time the sun goes down
'Gotta find a way somehow
To blank you out, blank you out

It's far too late to love again
It's hard to take and to forget
'Gotta find a way somehow
To blank you out, blank you out

I hear the thunder, feel the cold wind blow
It makes me wonder if you're all alone
So many answers we can never know
Oh, I'm not ready; sometimes it scares me

I wish I was with you now
And every time the sun goes down
'Gotta find a way somehow
To blank you out, blank you out

It's far too late to love again
It's hard to take and to forget
'Gotta find a way somehow
To blank you out, blank you out

Once you feel it
You need nothing
Feel my heart care
There must be something else

Once you feel it
You need nothing
Feel my heart care
There must be something else
