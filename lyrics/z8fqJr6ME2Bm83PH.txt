This party is over
We, we are alone
And I feel so helpless
There's nowhere to go
To storm on the sea
To stranger to me
Light on the shore
So let the wind blow
Carry me home
Lead me to your door
The room is so quiet
Hush, don't you cry
Daybreak is dawning
Cold, cold in the sky
So don't tell me your name
I can't stay here
Can't a cruel light of morning
Drive me away?
To storm on the sea
To stranger to me
Light on the shore
So let the wind blow
Carry me home
Lead me to your door
To storm on the sea
No stranger to me
Light on the shore
So let the wind blow
Carry me home
Lead me to your door
To storm on the sea
To stranger to me
Light on the shore
So let the wind blow
Carry me home
Lead me to your door
To storm on the sea
To stranger to me
Light on the shore
So let the wind blow
Carry me home
Lead me to your door
