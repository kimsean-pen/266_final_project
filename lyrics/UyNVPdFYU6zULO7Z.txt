Isn't it time to be forever
Could this be the only way
Merging the lines to come together
Is it's only just to say
Look at us now living just becomes the easy way
Never close your eyes
When I'm reaching deep inside within you
Listen to the flow
Let your mind and body know forever
Learning to change these things within me
Hoping, asking you to stay
If i could reach and touch tomorrow
We'd be happier today
Look at us now living just becomes the easy way
She knows how to fly
She can trust in what she likes together
Move into this bliss you've got so much love to give
It's in you
Learning to change these things within me
Hoping, asking you to stay
If i could reach and touch tomorrow
We'd be happier today
Isn't it time
To be forever
Could this be the only way
Merging the lines
To come together
Is it's only just to say
Look at us now
Are we happy just to be this way?
Look at us now
Living just becomes the easy way
