Misted windows
Hide your empty eyes
Every moment, every whisper
Separates you from me
I've been screaming
Won't you let me in?
Let me see a trace
Of the places hidden
Under your skin

I'll be waiting here for you

When you look away
And your silence
Sounds like deafening screams to me (screams to me)
I've been waiting
Won't you open your heart?
And let me in
Please let me in

I'll be one step behind you

All you have is now
Free your mind from shame
It will only bring you pain
