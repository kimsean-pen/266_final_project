Oh my god, Ronny!
Stupid

Like a Quarter Pounder, I found her
She with a boy think its Ned Flanders
She said that, really nice
With my ice, I drown her
I found her soul in the night
She's a Salamander
Cold-blooded the type

Yuh, this ain't that, bitch (Yuh), that ain't this, yuh (Yuh)
This ain't that, bitch (Yuh), that ain't this, yuh (Yuh, water!)
This ain't that, bitch (Yuh), that ain't this, yuh (Yuh)
This that him that's talking shit
Bend him like a blimp

I know she gon' swallow like the bitch can't swim
Hit 'em with a follow when a bitch can't tip, yuh
Who the fuck the reaper?
Fuck that nigga named Grim
I am the one with light inside the darkness of the den
I'm a god but I'm still praising God too
Know a nigga know dogs, sell dog food
Know my game on point, no harpoon
Know a nigga said I'm fry, so I told 'em get fist
'Cause these niggas too old too broke to
Cut em' off my frequency, no Pro Tools
Blue cheese and blue jeans
And you know they're Balmains,
So they come with the wrinkles like a Pug do

Yuh, this ain't that, bitch (Yuh), that ain't this, yuh (Yuh)
This ain't that, bitch (Yuh), that ain't this, yuh (Yuh)
This ain't that, bitch, that ain't this, yuh (Yuh)
Is that him that's talking shit?
Bend him like a blimp

Gucci on my body
Feel like water I can't swim
So I bought a Gucci rubber ducky with the fins
When I was a younging, hit at home I was 10
Told my Dad I was selling molly ninth grade in (Yeah)

You are now inside of my mind
It is very black and white, no mime
I put diamonds up on my time
Laid back siping Fiji with the lime, do
She an animal, eat me like bamboo
Young nigga, and I'm sly like CANTU

This ain't that, bitch (Yuh), that ain't this, yuh (Yuh)
This ain't that, bitch (Yuh), that ain't this, yuh (Yuh, water!)
This ain't that, bitch, that ain't this, yuh (Yuh)
Is that him that's talking shit?
Bend him like a blimp
