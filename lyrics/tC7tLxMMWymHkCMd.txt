It's so sad for us
When we find ourselves
Giving away, giving away
And it's a shame for us
When we find ourselves
Going to waste, going to waste
So throw away the love that we made.

(I know, I know)
And nothing's going to change that
(I know, I know)
And nothing's going to change that hopeless feeling
I get when you say you'll understand and I know you can't

There's no reason to be here
We should pack up and leave
I have never felt that way before totally alone
There's no reason to leave
I have never seen you act that way before, totally exposed.
As you throw away the love that we made

(I know, I know)
And nothing's going to change that
(I know, I know)
And nothing's going to change that hopeless feeling
I get when you say you'll understand and I know you can't

(I know, I know)
The longer it takes the more it goes to waste
(I know, I know)
I want to believe you but I can't feel a thing
(I know, I know)
The more that you get the less you are
(I know, I know)
Nothing's going to change that hopeless feeling
I get when you say you'll understand and I know you can't,
And I know you can't

And I know you can't help this feeling
I get when you say you'll understand and I know you can't
