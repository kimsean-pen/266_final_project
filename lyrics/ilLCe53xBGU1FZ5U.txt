Hey hey hey
Hey kid, the whole house is shakin'
We got the time, right in our sights

Well hey kid, you're the toast of the town

Screaming through the hours of the night

Hey hey hey,

But you know it won't last too long
You know it won't last too long
You know it won't last too long
You know it won't last too long Hey kid, you're the toast of the town
Well hey kid, you're the toast of the town

You heard me sayin', baby don't be a fool

Well pack your things baby, don't be a fool
Before it crashes down on you

Down on you
