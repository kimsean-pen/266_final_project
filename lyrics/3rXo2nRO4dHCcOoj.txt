Tell me I'm right for you or that I'm losing out
Know now that you're not flawless
We're on that "yeah well"
Tell me I'm right for you
These days are not in place
And sure yeah you're not blessed

Tell me I'm right for you or that I'm losing out
And I know that lovers will be
Lovers be doomed yeah
Tell me I'm right for you
These days are not in place
And sure yeah you're not blessed

So won't you cover this?
Make my life bliss
Don't know if you don't answer to provoke
And bae if you do it's too small

(And did you look, look at me yesterday?)

So won't you cover this?
Make my life bliss
You know I'm down and up for something better
And you should be down with me

(So won't you stay huh?)

So won't you cover this?
Make my life bliss
Yeah I go far for a heartbeat
So won't you stay huh?

I'm no girlfriend
So won't you stay huh?
I'm no girlfriend
So won't you stay huh?
And did you look, look at me yesterday?
So won't you stay huh?
I'm no girlfriend
So won't you stay huh?
