Spent the winter in that bar across the street
Feeling sorry for yourself
And at home with no-one else
But the clicking of the keys
A sound that keeps you company
Into the night

Is it shelter or underground where it ends
I am sitting on the deck
I'm destroying everything
But the clicking of the keys
A sound that keeps you company
Into the night

How long
Till you've had everyone
How long
Till you've had everyone

If you wonder where your memory it stands
I can feel you in my hands
I remember everything
But the clicking of the keys
A sound that keeps you company
Into the night

How long
Till you've had everyone
How long
Till you've had everyone
How long
Till you've had everyone
How long
Till you've had everyone
