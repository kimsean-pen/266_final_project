Built an empire from a pile of sticks, sticks and stones, sticks and stones
Foundation's made of broken hearts, broken hearts and broken bones
Voices in my head, they screamed "you will lose, you will lose"
In spite, I turned my enemies to my muse, into my muse

Gimme some inspiration, devastation, ammunition
Say I'm an apparition, malformation; what's the difference?

When you tear it all apart, it's just DNA
Destroying what we fear
Hate is such an ancient game
When we're all that we have left, yet we aim to kill
Pretending that we're made of steel
Living in a battlefield

Gonna count up all the chromosomes, do the math, make a clone
Someone who will understand so I don't feel all alone
Start a revolution and we'll rebel, we'll rebel
Feel all of the things that we never felt and never felt

Gimme some inspiration, devastation, ammunition
Say I'm an apparition, malformation; what's the difference?

When you tear it all apart, it's just DNA
Destroying what we fear
Hate is such an ancient game
When we're all that we have left, yet we aim to kill
Pretending that we're made of steel
Living in a battlefield

I feel extraterrestrial
Out of sync, a separate soul
But in the end, I'm not alone

When you tear it all apart, it's just DNA
Destroying what we fear
Hate is such an ancient game
When we're all that we have left, yet we aim to kill
Pretending that we're made of steel
Living in a battlefield
