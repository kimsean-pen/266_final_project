If all my enemies
Threw a party, would you light the candles?
Would you drink the wine while watchin' television?
Watch the animals and all the tragedies
And sell your arteries to buy my casket gown

Well, it better be black and it better be tight
And it better be just my size
I'm stalkin' these metro malls and airport halls
And all these schoolgirls

I'm not askin', you're not tellin'
He's not dead, he only looks that way

Out nowhere, take me out there
Far away and save me from my
Self-destruction, hopeless for you
Sing a song for California

I bought my enemies
Rope to hang me and the knives to gang me
You can watch them stab me on your television
Stomp the halls, because the bathroom walls
Would have a lot to say
About the lines you're puttin' down

Well, it better be white and better be cut
And better be just my size
Until my capillaries burst of boredom
I'll be waitin'

I'm not laughin', you're not jokin'
I'm not dead, I only dress that way

Out nowhere, take me out there
Far away and save me from my
Self-destruction, hopeless for you
Sing a song for California

Wherever you are
Whatever you are
Whoever you are
Whoever you are

La la la la

'Cause we got the bomb, we got the bomb, let's go!
We got the bomb, we got the bomb, let's go!
We got the bomb, we got the bomb, let's go!
We got the bomb, we got the bomb, let's go!

Way out nowhere, take me out there
Far away and save me from my
Self-destruction, hopeless for you
Say a prayer for California

We got the bomb!
We got the bomb!
We got the bomb!
We got the bomb!
