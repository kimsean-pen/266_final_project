Blinded by life beyond the veil
My morals inside
Abandoning bright side hope
I calmly convert into you

It's hard to prevail
Blood's thicker than water
I've tried
I could defy but instead
Avoidance has left me dead

Every time the tides hit me
I'm steeped in disbelief
Struggling bright side hope
I slowly turn into you

I meet my fate on the road I take to
Escape it

Instead I fail to resist
The urges plodding, you disguise
Your breath down my neck
I slowly turn into you

I meet my fate on the road I take to
Escape it

Only flesh of
What was dear to
Me I've shed my
Tears for you
Only flesh of
What was dear to me
Me I've shed my
Tears for you

Your escape is not so
Much worse as was mine
