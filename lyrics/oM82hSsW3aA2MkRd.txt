Told me rivers of gold would come
Had me chasing to see
I was kissing my only one
Left my pain with the breeze

I rise up in the morning sun
Take a flight with the wind
I know better days will come
So I try to believe

Look there's more to be hoping and
And there's doors to be opened and I
When it's all said and over
There'll be oceans to wonder for miles
Past the clouds and the coldness
There'll be flowers and roses so
Keep your head up, you're coping
And it feels like glory, Lord
Glory, Lord

And it feels like
It's in your heart now, let them notice
It's in your heart now
And it feels like
It's in your heart now, let them notice
It's in your heart now
And it feels like
It's in your heart now, let them notice
It's in your heart now
And it feels like glory, Lord
