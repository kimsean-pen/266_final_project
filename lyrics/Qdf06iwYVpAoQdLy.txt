As the sky turns black and the earth sleeps in peace
Roaming the clouds in search of a sacred place

Spirits soar higher to a land where they are king
Mortals shells left with you, within shadows they dwell

Take me far away - deep within the dream
There I can be free from life's misery

Blood rushes through my veins
I can feel exhilaration
The freedom of my mind can take me far beyond

Take me far away - deep within the dream
There clearly seen - life's unreality

Sanctuary

Take me far away - deep within the dream
There I can be free from life's misery

Each night I await the call of my silent quest
To run through the wind alive in the darkness

Take me far away - deep within the dream
There clearly seen life's unreality

As the dawn gets closer - to my body I shall return
To live amongst you all, for nightfall I yearn
