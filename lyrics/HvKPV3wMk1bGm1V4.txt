Since the very beginning
Surrounded by silence
Brooded in solitude
Grown in the darkling shades
Destined to find my own way
To create the path to follow
And the scars of tomorrow
Will make you bleed only today
And the rain keeps falling
Pouring down from the sky
Washing footmarks from the mire
Leaving no trace behind
And as the shadows grow taller
Swallow all the light
I'm left alone in darkness
With no one by my side
Since the very beginning
Chosen to bear the burden
Abide tragedy in the blood
Close shadows in the heart
Always beaten by the stronger
Never defeated by anyone
Never disarmed of power
Held by the ones guided by fire
