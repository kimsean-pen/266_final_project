We've got demons
Demons stuck inside our blood
You bring that drudge inside our heart
You bring it damage to be free

We've got demons
Demons stuck inside our blood
You bring that drudge inside of us
You bring it that much to be free

It's not about, Mamma
What we look like
We talk about ourselves
Even if we sound obssessed, Mamma

We want that crown, Mamma
We want it now
To be the selfish kings
Of a worthless temple

But that's why we're insane
We take mud to escape
Cause life's hard to take

So in our veins, it runs mud blood
We take all kinds of drugs
It's our way to pretend
That we enjoy the life we've got
Sometimes it hurts to pray
But in our insides, we've got mud blood

We got demons
Demons stuck inside our blood
We bring that drudge inside our heart
You bring a damage to be free

It's not about, Mamma
What we look like
We talk about ourselves
Even if we sound obssessed, Mamma

All we express
We couldn't care less
We wanna take you out back
In our game of chess

That's why we're insane
We take mud to escape
Cause life's hard to take

So in our veins, it runs mud blood
We take all kinds of drugs
It's our way to pretend
That we enjoy the life we've got
Sometimes it hurts to pray
But in ours insides, we've got mud blood

We're muddy tired,
We're muddy tired,
We're muddy tense, we've have mud blood, we take all kinds
of drugs
We're muddy tired,
We're muddy tired,
We're muddy tense, we've have mud blood, we take all kinds
of drugs

That's why we're insane
We take mud to escape
Cause live's hard to take

So in our veins, it runs mud blood
We take all kinds of drugs
Trying to pretend
That we enjoy the life we've got
Sometimes it hurts to pray
Together not the same

Insane, insane
In our veins it runs mud blood
Insane, insane
In our veins it runs mud blood
