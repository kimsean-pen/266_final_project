Wash with new soap behind the collar
Keeps a clean mental state
Don't usually bother in cold weather
But still I'm getting into work late
(Need)
And I don't need the practice

I've been making plans
(For the future)
Become an unconscious man
(All for the good)
I feel so unnecessary
(We don't think so, you seem star shaped)

Happy couple at the weekend
Keeps up camaraderie
And my mind boggles in the muddle
At the possibilities
(Need)
And I don't need the practice

I've been making plans
(For the future)
Become an unconscious man
(All for the good)
I feel so unnecessary
(We don't think so, you seem star shaped)

And I've been making plans
(For the future)
Become an unconscious man
(All for the good)
I feel so unnecessary
(We don't think so, you seem star shaped)

(La la la la)
(La la la)
(La la la la la la la)

I wash with new soap behind the collar
Helps keep down the laundry
And now I bother in cold weather
Because it cleans me mentally
(Need)
And I really don't need the practice

I've been making plans
(For the future)
Become an unconscious man
(All for the good)
I feel so unnecessary
(We don't think so, you seem star shaped)

I've been making plans
(For the future)
Become an unconscious man
(All for the good)
I feel so unnecessary
(We don't think so, you seem star shaped)
