Take me to the place where the white boys dance.
Take me to the place where they run and play.
My baby is gone,
You might have a chance.
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance.

They hug in silence,
As the sun sets
On their empty street.
Their suspicions where they rise and hide
And the man who sweeps them off she doesn't meet.
She walks inside and,
Pours a strong one.
Put her mind at ease.
It's the calm before another storm.
And the friendship's from the whiskey to the keys.
Take me to the place where the white boys dance.
Take me to the place where they run and play.
My baby is gone,
You might have a chance.
Just take me to the place where the white boys
Dance.
Her heart is racing,
She phones a friend and says:
I'm in an awful place.
That fool's been messin' round on me.
I've seen it in his eyes and on his face.
Hold on a minute.
You're talking crazy.
Don't be that jealous girl.
Just tell Levon you need an hour or two.
Cause we're gonna go change somebodies world.
Take me to the place where the white boys dance.
Take me to the place where they run and play.
My baby is gone,
You might have a chance.
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance.

It's the calm before another storm.
It's the calm before another storm.
And her brain shifts from the whiskey to the keys.
Take me to the place where the white boys dance.
Take me to the place where they run and play.
My baby is gone,
You might have a chance.
Just take me to the place where the white boys
Dance.
