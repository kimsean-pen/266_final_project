Am I asking all these questions for nothing?
I'm wondering if anyone's there
And I really need to make a confession
I hate to say that I'm a little bit scared

But I've been on this train too long
People gettin' off and on
I'm praying that I don't forget where I belong
And every time I ask myself
"Am I turning into someone else?"
I'm praying that I don't forget just who I am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand

I'm calling all my friends after midnight, yeah
To remind them that I'll always be there for them
It gets lonely when there's no one to talk to
But it's good to know that somebody cares

Cause I've been on this train too long
People getting off and on
I'm prayin' that I don't forget where I belong
And every time I ask myself
"Am I turning into someone else?"
I'm praying that I don't forget just who I am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand

'Cause we all get lost sometimes, yeah
We all get lost sometimes
Don't leave your heart behind
'Cause we all get lost sometimes

I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand who I am

When you wake up your whole world's flipped
It's just different, and you gotta, you know, you gotta, you gotta go with it
And that's just simply growing up
And not see it in a negative way
If they see it as it has been given to you
I mean, as much as time can be crazy
You're gonna feel like that's where you're supposed to be
You're not going to feel out of place anymore
You're going to feel like that's where you were meant to be
You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time
You just let it go, and, and grow with it
And you can't hold on to the old you, or the old this, or the old that
Because you know you change, and it's not changing in a bad way
It's just changing because that's what happens life
You grow up, everyone moves on
You're just learning
You stay true to yourself

Changing isn't a bad thing
It never was
But at the end of the day, you know
You're the same person
And, and where your heart is
That doesn't change

And everytime I ask myself
"Am I turning into someone else?"
And I just really got that I'm still who I am
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand who I am
