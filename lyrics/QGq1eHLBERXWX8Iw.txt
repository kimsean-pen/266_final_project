I had a dream last night, a vision, a prelude?
Outside my body, I was free to do
All things under the sun, and everything I want
My head awake and clear, for everybody to hear
And like the brightest day... it fades away...

Revelation and progress
Thorns to the weak
We are the eve of the ugly
The dawn of the new everything

Here is love, here is sunrise
Assassination of the old
Here's peeling off corrosion
When he killing off the burdens that you have

The blessing, the curse
Wield the order in chaos
Execution and birth

In the midnight hour
And your soul's devoured
We go into the mass
Oh your heart is aching
And you feel forsaken
We go to black mass

A dream last night, and I wonder, was it true?
I saw a big machine, in a velvet castle room
Inside the doom club, the spice, the cloak and dagger
And the pentagram, I think I understand

More cyclones, more witches
Inside the circle and the ring
In the ruins lies the future
Another dimension, another fling

The blessing, the curse
Wield the order in chaos
Execution and birth

No, no, no...

In the midnight hour
And your soul's devoured
We go into the mass
Oh your heart is aching
And you feel forsaken
We go to black mass
Oh people, keep the light on
We bring a new sensation
Enjoy the mass
