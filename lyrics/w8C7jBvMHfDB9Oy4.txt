I know it, we can wash out time
Just know it, it's gonna be alright
And I look into your eyes, stare into your soul
Tangled up in your arms, I don't feel so cold

You make me feel like no one else
You make me feel like no one else

I see the pain, just seem to follow it
Sometimes I feel like shit and I can't breathe
I wanna sleep the world away 'til I turn to dust
But you pull me out of there, stitch out my heart
Help me breathe

You make me feel like no one else
You make me feel like no one else

Make me feel like no one else
You make me feel like no one else
Make me feel like no one else
You make me feel like no one else
