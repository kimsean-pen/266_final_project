You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
Every day I feel this pain
But you just turn and walk away, no

I just can't keep hangin' on to you and me
I just don't know what is wrong with you and me
Touch me and then turn away and put your hands into the flame

Tell me if you feel this pain
'Cause I don't want to be a ball and chain, no

I just can't keep hangin' on to you and (wann' 'eh)
I just don't know what is wrong with you and me
I just can't keep hangin' on to you and me

You and me
You and me
