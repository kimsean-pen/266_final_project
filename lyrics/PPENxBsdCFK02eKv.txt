And with my opened mouth
I join the singing light

I can see the flickers
Over me the lanterns raised
Lift me up, lift me over it

Show me what you're hiding
Take me out into the sea
Lift me up
Life me over it
And with my opened mouth

I join the singing light
And with my opened mouth

I join the singing light
I can see the flickers
Over me the lanterns raised
Lift me up, lift me over it
