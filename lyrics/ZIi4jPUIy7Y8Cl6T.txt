It's only been three weeks
But I don't ever wanna leave
Just like the movies
Take me to the sixteenth
We can be the bourgeoisie
MD and V.S.O.P
He's looking at other girls but I don't care
'Cause I'm just trying to figure out what he wants me to wear
He's looking at other girls but I don't care
He's just a shallow boy but he makes you feel like you're in Paris
He makes you feel like you're in Paris
He's just a shallow boy but he makes you feel like you're in Paris
Like Venus de Milo
I'm living in a gallery
I can't touch what I can see
Reflections in the window
Of life from the mezzanine
Reminds me what I can't be
In love with another world and I'm aware
He's just a shallow boy but he makes you feel like you're in Paris
He makes you feel like you're in Paris
He's just a shallow boy but he makes you feel like you're in Paris
Shallow boy, just a shallow boy
Shallow boy (shallow boy, shallow boy, shallow boy)
Shallow boy, just a shallow boy
Shallow boy (shallow boy, shallow boy, shallow boy)
He makes you feel like you're in Paris
He's just a shallow boy but he makes you feel like you're in Paris
He makes you feel like you're in Paris
