Now, if I were a bricklayer, I wouldn't build just anything
And if I were a ball player, I wouldn't play no second string
And if I were some jewelry, baby, Lord, I'd have to be a diamond ring

If I were a secret, Lord, I never would be told
And if I were a jug of wine, Lord, my flavor would be old
I could be most anything,
But it got to be twenty-four karat solid gold

If I were a gambler, you know, I'd never lose
If I were a guitar player, Lord, I'd have to play the blues

If I were a hacksaw, my blade'd be razor sharp
And if I were a politician, I could prove that monkey talk
You can find the tallest building, Lord, I'd have me the house on top

Oh, let's go

Alright

I'm the penthouse pauper, I got nothing to my name
I'm the penthouse pauper, baby, I got nothing to my name
I can be most anything, oh when you got nothing it's all the same

Oh, let's move

Lord, look at my penthouse
