I can see it your eyes
Why you're here tonight
LookinG for that something sacred you'll never find
And you know there must be some way
To wash away the pain
Just like you did your faith

So we can
Forget
Forget
Forget
Forget the fear you try to hide
Forget
Forget
Forget
Forget the pain you keep inside
(all the pain you keep inside)

And before we all regress
To this emptiness
Crawl across the floor once more
Scraping hands and knees
And just know there must be some way
To wash away the pain
Just like you did your faith

So we can
Forget
Forget
Forget
Forget the fear you try to hide
Forget
Forget
Forget
Forget the pain you keep inside

I know that all of us must feel this way
I know that all of us must feel this way

Forget the past
Forget the pain
Forget your fear

Yeah
So we can
Forget
Forget
Forget
Forget the fear you try to hide
Forget
Forget
Forget
Forget the pain you keep inside
Forget
Forget
Forget
Forget the fear you try to hide
Forget
Forget
Forget
Forget the pain you keep inside
Forget the pain you keep inside
Forget the pain you keep inside
Forget
Forget
Forget
