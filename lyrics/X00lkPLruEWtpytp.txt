Sit in a Big White Room alone.
Tilt my head back,
Feel the tears fall
Down...
Close my eyes to see in the dark.
I feel young, broken,
So, so scared...
Ooh!
I don't wanna be here anymore.

I wanna be somewhere else,
Normal and free,
Like I used to be,
But I have to stay in this Big White Room
With little ol' me...
I'm going crazy,
I'm losing my mind.

I'm going crazy,

In this Big White Room of mine.
I'm going crazy, yeah,
I'm losing my mind.
I'm going crazy,
In this Big White...
Room of...
Mine...
Sitting in a Big White Room alone.

Close the door,
Don't want the pain to come in.

No!
I clench my fist and try to stay strong.

I cry, feel sick.
My heart's beating,
B-b-b-b-b-beating, beating
Out of control, yes!

Can I run, run faster than you?
I wanna feel my body again,
Feel the wind in my hair, yeah!
But I have to stay in this Big White Room

'Cause no one else
Cares...
No! No! No! No! No! N-n-n-no! No!

I'm going crazy, yeah,
I'm losing my mind.
I'm going crazy
In this Big White Room of mine.
I'm going crazy,

I'm losing my mind.
I'm going crazy,
In this Big White Room of mine.
Everybody's looking at me.
Everybody's staring at me.
What do I do now?
Smile?
Yeah, yeah...
Everybody's looking at me.
Everybody's staring at me.
What do I do now?
Smile!!!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!!!
Ooh, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah... Oh, ooh, ah...
I'm going crazy,
I'm losing my mind.
I'm going crazy,
In this Big White Room of mine.
I'm going cray, c-c-c-c-c-crazy,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm going crazy,
In this Big White Room of mine.
I'm going crazy,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm going crazy
In this Big White...
Room of...
Mine...
Thank you.
