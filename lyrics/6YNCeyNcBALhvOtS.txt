Here comes that feeling again
Down on My Life again
And, I'm joyless again
Down on My Love again
I feel empty again
And, I'm feral again

Good Mourning Sun, Good Mourning Sun,
Good Mourning Sun, Good Mourning Sun,
Good Mourning Sun

And, on this Winter's Day
I can't drink it away
I feel it's here to stay
The rains they seem to pour and pour
And, what is more
I'll always settle to score

Good Mourning Sun, Good Mourning Sun,
Good Mourning Sun, Good Mourning Sun,
Good Mourning Sun

It's never really gone away
Wild caught, lying, whoring day
You crow and I cry
Others pay to watch you die
You could be murdered at this time of day
But, when the Mourning came
Your Death would be
A Lifetime away,...away

Good Mourning Sun,...
