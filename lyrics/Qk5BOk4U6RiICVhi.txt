It's all in your mind
She said the darkness and the light
The clock it bleeds for you
But you never got the timin' right
I woke you up and I slit the throat of your confidence
And we laughed in the night
And I felt all right

All hands on deck boys 'cause this ship was made to sink
Your swabber salutes you now
But I know what he's thinking
I woke you up and I slit the throat of your confidence
And we laughed in the night
And I felt all right

Thanks a lot
Thanks a lot
You don't even know
Thanks a lot

The clothes she wears misfit
And she's nervous when she speaks
Her zombie mom and dad live in a separate house of freaks
I woke you up and I slit the throat of your confidence
And we laughed in the night
And I felt all right

Thanks a lot
Thanks a lot
You don't even know
Thanks a lot

I'm the one for you
'cause I know all the dirty things you like to do
I'm the fear in your eyes, I'm the fire in your flies
I'm the sound that's buzzing around your head

Thanks a lot
Thanks a lot
You don't even know
Thanks a lot
Thanks a lot
