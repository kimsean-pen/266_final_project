If I gave you forever
Would you take care of me?
Would you take me for granted?
On the way
Those wonderful things that you do
They got me feelin'
In love with you
In love with you
Cause loving you is easy
Comes so naturally
Loving you is easy
Comes so naturally
I would give you laughter
Oh
And so much more than that
Oh, yes I would
Anything your after
I would climb the highest mountain to bring it back
You better believe
Those wonderful things that you do
They got me feelin'
In love with you
In love with you
That loving you is easy
Comes so naturally
Loving you is easy
Comes so naturally
I will stay by your side
Whether I'm wrong
Whether I'm right
Oh, it's incredible
With you I intend to spend the rest of my life, yeah
Loving you is easy
Comes so naturally
Loving you is easy
Comes so naturally
Loving you is easy
Comes so naturally
Loving you is easy
Comes so naturally
Loving you is easy
Comes so naturally
Loving you is easy
Comes so naturally
Loving you is easy
Loving you is easy
Loving you is easy
Loving you is easy
