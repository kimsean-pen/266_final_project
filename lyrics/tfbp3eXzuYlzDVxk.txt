I know the deal
You gotta do
Something that's real
That only you can do
I'll help you go
And turn that storm
I'm just sad I gotta stay and watch you fly alone

I'll be right here
I won't look down
I'm working on a way to make it work somehow
We can't turn back
We can't rewind
Well baby, now we're closer to the other side

Oooooh
Oooooh
You want it now
So, I want you for it
All this time
So, I want you for it

I'm all eyes
I wanna see you more
And realize what this is gonna do

I'll be right here
I won't look down
I'm working on a way to make it work somehow
We can't turn back
We can't rewind
Well baby, now we're closer to the other side

Babe, stay on the line
Make a move
Call the shots
Make up your mind

You want it now
So, I want you for it
All this time
So, I want you for it
So, I want you for it
All this time
So, I want you for it
(Stay on the line)
(Make a move)
(Call the shots)
(Make up your mind)

I'm all eyes
I wanna see you more
And realize what this is gonna do

Babe, stay on the line
Make a move
Call the shots
Make up your mind
