And I don't want you looking in
Don't want you over here
Don't want you asking
What is wrong with me
What is wrong

And I
I've got this open wound
So put through all of you
To come on in and

Tell me what is wrong
So what is wrong?
With everything I ever did with you
Has blown to pieces
With everything and everyone we knew

And all I need is
To make a stand and try as I might
I don't want you asking

I don't want you asking me
What is wrong
And I
My head is caving in
The whole world is looking in

And telling me what is wrong
Well what is wrong

With all of you
Don't want you looking in
Just what is wrong
With everything I ever had with you
Has been torn to pieces
And everything and everyone we knew

Knows what we did
So I'll make a stand and try as I might
Give up on you
And everything I ever had with you
Has been torn to pieces
And everything and everyone we knew
Knows what we did
So I'll make a stand and try as I might
Give up on you
