Break

The days are passing by
The voices grow louder
I can't get through the night
Tossing and turning

Wake up, nothing feels the same
I'm not the person I was yesterday
I can't find my center
I've lost my temper again
Feels like I'm gonna, feels like I'm gonna break

I can't turn off my mind
The voices take over me
Try to contain them, they drive me insane
And I feel like I'm caving in
I'm caving in, I'm caving

Wake up, nothing feels the same
I'm not the person I was yesterday
I can't find my center
I've lost my temper again
Feels like I'm gonna, feels like I'm gonna break

I'm gonna break

Wake up, nothing feels the same
I'm not the person I was yesterday
I can't find my center
I've lost my temper again
Feels like I'm gonna, feels like I'm gonna break

I think I'm gonna break
I think I'm gonna break
