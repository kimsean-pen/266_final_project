You've come a long way from the runny-nosed and scruffy kid I knew
You had such good ways
I can remember the little things that always made you smile
They made you happy
Now you think you're wiser because you're older
and you think
That money buys everything
And you think
that you need no one to guide you
But you're still a long way from home.
You've come a long way, you're self-assured and dressed in funny clothes
but you don't know me.
I hope you find what you are looking for
with your car and your handmade overcoats
But your wealth will never make you stronger
'cos you're still a long way from home
Yea, you're still a long way from home
