Make up your mind
Are you really becoming this?
Are you going along to get along?
I hope I got it wrong

You know I've tried
And it's hard for me to resist
There's a point to be made and a line to cross
Doesn't matter what it costs

Am I supposed to be afraid?
Should I be careful what I say?
You never listened anyway
It doesn't make a difference

I won't say I'm sorry
I won't take back a single word
This is exactly how I feel
I won't say I'm sorry
Take me exactly at my word
It doesn't matter how you feel

You're out of line
But instead I'm the one to blame
And I'm sickened by how we buy the lie
And no one seems to mind

I can't see things the way
You meant for them to be
I must be blind
On this, I think we both agree
