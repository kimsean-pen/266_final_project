You can be right and I'll be real
Honesty won't be a pain that you'll have to feel
'Cause I don't need your approval to find my worth
I'm trapped inside of my own mind
Afraid to open my eyes 'cause of what I'd find
And I don't want to live like this anymore

There goes my pain
There goes my chains
Did you see them falling?
There goes this feeling that has no meaning

There goes the world off of my shoulders
There goes the world off of my back
There it goes

Does it scare you that
I can be something different than you?
Would it make you feel more comfortable if I wasn't?
You can't control me
And you can't take away from me who I am

There goes my pain
There goes my chains
Did you see them falling?
There goes this feeling that has no meaning

There goes the world off of my shoulders
There goes the world off of my back
You can't change me
You can't break me

There goes the world off of my shoulders
There goes the world off of my back

Have you ever felt that your only comfort was your cage?
You're not alone
I have felt the same as you
Have you ever felt like your secrets give you away?
You're not alone
I have been there, too

Everyone is looking, and everyone is laughing
But I think everyone feels the same
Everybody wants to feel okay
Everybody wants to
Everybody wants to feel

There goes my pain
There goes my chains
Did you see them fall?
There goes this feeling that has no meaning

There goes the world off of my shoulders
There goes the world off of my back

'Cause I don't want it
I don't want it
You can't change me
You can't break me

There goes the world off of my shoulders
There goes the world off of my back
There it goes
