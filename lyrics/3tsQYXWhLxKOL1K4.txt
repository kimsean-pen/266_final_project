Oh

Control the urge to spit up vile worms... soul
Monsters seduced by her attention
Try draining the infection
Whoa-go
Go, oh

Locked in a world of vomit-soaked skin, heaven
Monsters seduced by her attention
She's draining the infection

"carol anne," the beast is calling
"carol anne, carol anne," she can hear souls sing
"carol anne," the beast it needs you
Here it comes, here it comes
Reaching out somewhere from inside your tv
Whoa-go
Go, oh

Control the urge to spit up vile worms... soul
Monsters seduced by her attention
Try draining the infection
Whoa-oh

"carol anne," the beast is calling
"carol anne, carol anne," she can hear souls sing
"carol anne," the beast it needs you
Here it comes, here it comes
Reaching out somewhere from inside your tv

"carol anne," the beast is calling
"carol anne, carol anne," she can hear souls sing
"carol anne," the beast it needs you
Here it comes, here it comes
Reaching out somewhere from inside your tv
