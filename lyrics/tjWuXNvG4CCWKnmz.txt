We wrote this song, it's not too short, not too long
It's got back-up voc's in just the right places
It's got a few oohs and ahhs
It takes a little pause
Just before I sing the anthem
Please play this song on the radio
Almost every line is sung on time
Almost every verse ends in a rhyme
The only problem we had was writing enough words
But that's okay, because the chorus is
Coming up again now
Please play this song on the radio
Please play this song on the radio
Right about this time
Some shithead will be drawin a fat fuckin line
Over the title on the backsleeve
What an asshole!
So mr. DJ,
I hope you've already made your segway
or the FCC is gonna take a shit right on your head.
