You complete me
Like air and water boy, I need thee
And when I'm in your arms I feel free
Fallen
My head's up in the clouds in love
I'm proud to you say it loud
Like an accident it happened
Out of nowhere it just happened
And I ain't mad at all
Because I've

Fallen, head over heels
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen, and I can't get up
Don't wanna get up because of love (because of love)

Fallen, head over heels
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen, and I can't get up
Don't wanna get up because of love

Baby
To let you get away is crazy (let you get away)
So I'm doing what it takes
To make you pledge your love to me
You see, 'cause I'm tryna be your lady
For ever and ever baby
The picture wouldn't be the same
If you weren't standing next to me
Can't you see I'm fallen?

Fallen, head over heels
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen, and I can't get up
Don't wanna get up because of love (because of love)

Fallen, head over heels
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen, and I can't get up
Don't wanna get up because of love

You complement me, not an accessory
You're necessary
(You never could speak bad words 'gainst me)
You're bare with me (security)
Are you here with me?
You're my happiness, my joy (joy)
It's all because of you, boy
I look forward to the time I spend with you
Whatever it is we do

'Cause I'm fallen for you, boy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fallen, I've fallen for you
Fallen, head over heels for you
So in love with you, fallen
For you

Touch me (touch me)
Hold me (hold me)
Love me (love me)
Kiss me (in love with you)
Talk to me (talk to me)
Caress me (oh)
Play with me (don't wanna get up)
Explore me (you're my everything)

Fallen, head over heels
I've fallen in love with you (to let you get away is crazy)
I've fallen, and I can't get up (I can't get up)
Don't wanna get up because of love

Fallen, head over heels (touch me, hold me)
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen, and I can't get up (with you)
Don't wanna get up because of love

Fallen, head over heels (In love)
I've fallen in love with you (my joy)
I've fallen, and I can't get up
Don't wanna get up because of love (head over heels for you)

Fallen, head over heels (so in love with you)
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen, and I can't get up
Don't wanna get up because of love
Fallen...
