Hey there girl, what's up?
You like my drawings
Thank you very much

I smile, you smile
My stomach fills up with butterflies
What do you want to today, today?

We could go to my house
Sit down on the carpet
Watch some cartoons
It's up to you

When the sky's blue
I don't know what to think about when you
When the sky's blue
I just look up and think about

When the sky's blue
I don't know what to think about when you
When the sky's blue
I just look up and think about

You put your backpack in the back seat
And then you sit down, sit right next to me, yeah
I'll drive you to my parent's house
And then we start making out
While we're listening to Cherry Bomb
Order pizza then we take it outside

Today is a perfect day
Today is a perfect day, with you
Today is a perfect day
Today is a perfect day, with you

Today is a perfect day
Today is a perfect day, with you
Today is a perfect day
Today is a perfect day, with you

I wake
I open my eyes
And sunlight pours in
Sky is blue, sky is blue, sky is blue, sky is blue

I see your face
You're looking at me
Wonder what to do
You're thinking "who are you?"
("It's Zack remember?", "Uhh... I don't think so")

You had your head on my chest
Watching Parks and Rec
Sky is blue, sky is blue, sky is blue, sky is blue

Something shook me away
And you disappeared
For years, so weird oh

I don't know what to think about
I just look up and think about
