"Crossroads"
(Famous by Robert Johnson)
Later on performed by many others (Cream)
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees.
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees.
Asked the Lord for mercy, "Help me if you please."
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride.
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride.
Nobody seemed to know me, everybody passed me by.

You can run, you can run
Tell my friend-boy, Willie Brown.*
You can run, you can run
Tell my friend-boy, Willie Brown.*

And I'm staying at the crossroads, believe I'm sinking down.
The End.
