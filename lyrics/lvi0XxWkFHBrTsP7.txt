This is the right time, once in a lifetime
So I find it hard to sleep, don't you know,
The sun is shining in my window, life's in flow,
Makin' music in the morning, laughter's light,
Creativity touches in full flight,

This is the right time, once in a lifetime,
Keep it going, let's not lose it, feel the flow,
Oh, flying free in a fantasy, with you I'll go,

This is the right time, once in a lifetime,
Now something has entered my mind, shattering all of my thoughts,
It's no good, it's just one big waste of my time,
But what can I do to recall?

This is the right time, once in a lifetime,
This is the right time, once in a lifetime,
This is the right time, once in a lifetime,
This is the right time, once in a lifetime,
This is the right time, once in a lifetime,
