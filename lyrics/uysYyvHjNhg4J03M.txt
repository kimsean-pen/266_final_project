I should probably start reading
'Cause if my brain is only eating
Candy and Blue Ribbon
I'll be such a stupid man
Talk with the bad breath like ew, ew
I put the money in my wallet
Sour on my lips, but I-I-I-I
Taste no guilt in trying
What's the use in always crying
Kick about and make out
You might just learn something
Bring your friends we're up to nothing
Conditioned for the short term satisfcation
Baby believe I'm trying
Expensive hobbies for the broke boys
Perpetual vacation self effacing
Amateur chemists and their toys
I should probably start reading
'Cause if my brain is only eating
Candy and Blue Ribbon
I'll be such a stupid man
Talk with the bad breath, walk with an unsure step
Candy and Blue Ribbon
Candy and Blue Ribbon
Candy and Blue Ribbon
Like ew, ew
