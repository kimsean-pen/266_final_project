How cold the tear can feel on warm skin?
So delicate, violently it begins
Within this universe I will be lost
Moving from rivers to mountain tops

Can't stay here
I'll throw myself in the ocean
I lift myself and run

Like a gentle earthquake, it intensifies
It's like my lungs are breathing fire
(My heart, my head, my mind!)
And if the fire dies
My body will be the truth
And the light will guide her
Light will guide her

The fascinating way you change your colours
The ugly and the flawless beauty of us
With the combination of purple and pink
The only traces of our love blossoming

I'm not home
In a place where love has been broken
I lift myself and run

Like a gentle earthquake
It intensifies
It's like my lungs are breathing fire
(My heart, my head, my mind!)
And if the fire dies
My body will be the truth
And the light will guide her
(My heart, my head, my mind!)

Twisted body parts moving synchronized
Watching lightning strike in my lover's eyes
All the flowers grow to a luscious field
All connecting love becomes a human shield

In the eleventh hour
Finally a hidden flower
In the last moment
Finally opens

Like a gentle earthquake
It intensifies
It's like my lungs are breathing fire
(My heart, my head, my mind!)
And if the fire dies
My body will be the truth
And the light will guide her
(My heart, my head, my mind!)

Twisted body parts moving synchronized
Watching lightning strike in my lover's eyes
All the flowers grow to a luscious field
All connecting love becomes a human shield
