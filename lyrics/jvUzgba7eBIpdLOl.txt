I'm in you, you're in me, I can't tell
You're so cruel, more than me, it is true, that's right
Loyal to only you, up your sleeve
I want some, of all of you, trickin' me

First it giveth then it taketh away
First it giveth then it taketh away
First it giveth then it taketh away
First it giveth then it taketh away

I would beg, I would plead, I would shake
On a hook, dangling, by the way
I'm so young and beautiful, I'm no fool
Time goes by, tables turn, now I know

First it giveth then it taketh away
First it giveth then it taketh away
First it giveth then it taketh away
First it giveth then it taketh away

First it giveth then it taketh away
First it giveth then it taketh away
Away, away, oh
