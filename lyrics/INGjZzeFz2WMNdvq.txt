Why won't you call me?
Just give me your mouth
Won't you be straight with me
I can be older
Just give me the chance
I will win it all

Can you control the Sienna
To take her look

Relax your lips
Long blonde hair
I don't know if
You're even there
(Put out the fire)
I never let go
(Put out the fire)
I let the flames grow

Don't call it quits
Cold hard stare
I won't go if
You're standing there
(Put out the fire)
I never let go
(Put out the fire)
I let the flames

I'm really sorry
But I will win unintentionally
You can be sober
I want to dance
And I'm not dancing alone

Can you control the Sienna
Would you patrol its yellow lights

Relax your lips
Long blonde hair
I don't know if
You're even there
(Put out the fire)
I never let go
(Put out the fire)
I let the flames grow

Don't call it quits
Cold hard stare
I won't go if
You're standing there
(Put out the fire)
I never let go
(Put out the fire)
I let the flames

Nobody waits
Nobody calls anymore
Talking is dead with these conversations
Tired nations
Nobody cares
Too many thoughts at the door
It's all in your head
Cause these days I'm awaken
I've been shaken
Here I am
Here I am
I been played
Here I am
(Let go)
