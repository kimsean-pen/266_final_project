So you think I have got an evil mind
Well I'll tell you honey
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
So you think my singin's' out of time
Well it makes me money
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
Anymore, oh no

So cum on feel the noize
Girls grab the boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Cum on feel the noize
Girls grab the boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild

At your door

So you think you I got a funny face
Well I'm not worried
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
Along about last week I stopped this race
I'm in no hurry
And I don't know why

And I don't know why
Anymore, oh no

So cum on feel the noize
Girls grab the boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Cum on feel the noize

Girls grab the boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
At your door

So you think we have a lazy time
You should know better
And I don't know why
I just don't know why
And you say I got a dirty mind

Well I'm a mean go-getter
And I don't know why
I just don't know why
Anymore, oh no

So cum on feel the noize
Girls grab the boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
We'll get wild, wild, wild
So cum on feel the noize
Girls grab the boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
At your door
