Another buisness trip
Another reason to stay away
You're coming home on monday, smelling Tangerine

They say that I should leave you
Yeah, go and find someone new
Who doesn't love a girl that smells like Tangerine

I'm not going to beg just say please, please, please
Be good to me

This happens to all of us
Apparently I'm not good enough
I can't make you laugh like Tangerine

And you say "but I'm still here,
that proves that I love you dear"
Late at night you come home smelling Tangerine

I'm not going to beg just say please, please, please
Be good to me

I'm not going to beg just say please, please, please
Be good to me
