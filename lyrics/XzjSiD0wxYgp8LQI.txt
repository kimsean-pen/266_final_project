When I look around you I understand why you believe
I see your evidence of God, all around me

You have so therefore you are But I have not.
You've seen the evidence of God in your life, but I have none.

When I was questioned, I shook my head and starred
I was traveling alone, and had nothing to declare

He asked how I knew for sure
And would I tell everyone I knew
If it would hurt to know the truth

I can be thankful to be alive but I despise this life.
in all my years, at best, have only learned just to survive.

But When I look around you I understand why you believe
I see your evidence of God, all around me

You have so therefore you are But I have not.
You've seen the evidence of God but I have not and I have none

(When he asked me,) I shook my head and laughed
I never had a taste for life
and I felt there was no turning back

Would I try to take away their hope?
Replace it with reality / and offer them reality
Exchange their joy with my bleak view
And leave them miserable like me?

I have searched and I have tried to find a place where I can be
I love my homeland dearly but never carved a place in society

But When I look around you I understand why you believe
I see your evidence of God, all around me

You have so therefore you are, but I have not
You are too rich for hate, and I am too poor to love.

When I asked him, he shook his head and stared
â€œI see no evidence of God, in the men from the west
