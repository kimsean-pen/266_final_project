I'm standing in her room now
She's saying that I've been gone too long
Says she's witnessed hundreds of hours
People they all just wander around

I'll get higher tonight when I know that you're here
Feel the digital life keeping me young
This digital life don't keep me warm
Give me iron for bones so I could be strong

The clock is ticking down to zero
She's praying that it won't run out
She says we've lost our sense of nature
People they all just wander around

I get higher to life when I know that you're here
Feel the digital life keeping me young
This digital life don't keep me warm
Give me iron for bones so I could be strong

Part of one family
It's never just you and me
Part of one family
Part of one family
It's never just you and me
Part of one family

I get higher to life when I know that you're here
Feel the digital life keeping me young
This digital life don't keep me warm
Give me iron for bones so I could be strong
