Pick demons up set demons free
Issue my fire on the weakened liar
Last [Incomprehensible] in town, set to burn it down
I summoned you to the aftermath

Apnoea
Oh, bearing down on me
Apnoea
Oh, bearing down on me

Apnoea
Oh, bearing down on me
Apnoea
Oh, bearing down on me

Apnoea
Oh, bearing down on me
Apnoea
Oh, bearing down on me

Put your boots in man, put your boots in girl
See the piggies fly, see the system fail
Said it isn't me, said it isn't you
Change made by all and not by one

Apnoea
Apnoea
Oh, can't you see it girl?

Apnoea
[Incomprehensible]
Apnoea
Oh, can't you see it girl?
