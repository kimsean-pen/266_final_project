When the heat of light
Melts into the speeding time
When the king returns
From the ivory city side
Let the magnet images wave the signals
Flashing, oh, so fast
Then you'll meet me there
Under the moonshine

In a lover's heaven
We'll keep our promises at last
In a lover's heaven
We'll forget the past

Do you want to dance with me
Through one of those lonely nights?
It's more than a dream
Maybe we're reaching the gardens of delight
Do you want to dance with me
Through one of those lonely nights?
It's more than a dream
Maybe we're drowning in empires of delight

In the stardust dawn
Underneath the crystal roofs
Where the solar boys are playing games
And they never lose
Where the sailors are swaying
Through the light domes
Shining from the skies
There you'll meet me, darling, anyway

In a lover's heaven
We'll keep our promises at last
In a lover's heaven
We'll forget the past

Do you want to dance with me
Through one of those lonely nights?
It's more than a dream
Maybe we're reaching the gardens of delight
Do you want to dance with me
Through one of those lonely nights?
It's more than a dream
Maybe we're drowning in empires of delight

In a lover's heaven
We'll keep our promises at last
In a lover's heaven
We'll forget the past

Do you want to dance with me
Through one of those lonely nights?
It's more than a dream
Maybe we're reaching the gardens of delight
Do you want to dance with me
Through one of those lonely nights?
It's more than a dream
Maybe we're drowning in empires of delight
Do you want to dance with me
Through one of those lonely nights?
It's more than a dream
Maybe we're drowning in empires of delight
