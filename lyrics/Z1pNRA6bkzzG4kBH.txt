Making love, you're the enemy, never free
So you told, make control what you think and see
Now let's go, take a hole and find energy
Shake a fist for the Russian kiss

So your love witch you gotta' lose, gotta' lose
Freak your mind do not hide when they come at you
Make a noise, make it stand, have an attitude
Shake a fist for the Russian kiss

Give me a kiss, give me a kiss nah-ah
Give me a kiss, give me a kiss nah-ah

Shake a fist for the Russian kiss!
Shake a fist for the Russian kiss!

Don't give up, maybe then, they can understand
It is right that you fight for your love demands
For a soul, love is worth, so come raise your hand
Shake a fist for the Russian kiss

Give me a kiss, give me a kiss nah-ah
Give me a kiss, give me a kiss nah-ah

Shake a fist for the Russian kiss!
Shake a fist for the Russian kiss!
