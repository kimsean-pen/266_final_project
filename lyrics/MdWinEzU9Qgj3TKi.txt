If I could have it all I'd give you half
Another day is wasted and tomorrow's passed
But if I could have it all, I'd give you half
If I could have it all, I'd give you half
I'd give you...

A sky of stars paint the lakes
Do you regret your mistakes?
The ones you make
Can they be replaced, rearranged, erased?
If not, then change your point of view to a better shade of you

I'd give you...
I'd give you...

If I can have it all then you could have it all too
If only we can choose
