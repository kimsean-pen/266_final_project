I've had my frustrations about the pains of daily life
I've tasted degradation and found the lace and candle light
But we have the weights, we have the measures of our days and nights
I've had my frustrations, but now, I've found my place

And you will make it
But only if you run

These lonely dedications I've found, they bring me peace and light
When three-fold applications of doubt surround my fate, you might say
We have the weights, we have to wage an assault on what it is
'Cause harmless medications abound, and you're not sick

You will make it
But only if you run

Surprise
Surprise
Surprise
Surprise

You will make it
But only if you run
