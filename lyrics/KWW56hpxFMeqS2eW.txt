The paper called it suicide
A bullet from a forty-five
Nobody cared and nobody cried
Don't that make you feel sad?

Peter Brent combed his hair and sent
For the police
Policeman came took Peter's name
God may he rest in peace

No one saw the note beside the body
Nobody knew the problem but my God
Suicide
Yeah Mama

The body remains unidentified
Forgotten in a file
Like the letter that was blown aside
Don't that make you wanna smile?
Ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya
Awhile
Smile a little while
For the suicide
Comin' up

No one was really satisfied
About number eighty one
The autopsy proved that Peter lied
But they never found the gun

No one saw the note beside the body
Nobody knew the problem but my God
Suicide

The paper called it suicide
A bullet from a forty-five
Nobody cared and nobody cried
Don't that make you wanna pucker?

{I'm Jones the one when you drive there
This is his solo miya
This is song called Sha la la...}
