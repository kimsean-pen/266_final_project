Going to get out of here
So many voices fill this place
Society is in my solitude
Oh, find me the corner of this great space
If I'd heard every word
Or read every line upon the shelf
I'd still need a message to myself

A message to myself

Searching for the elements
The roots of a fundamental love
Been reaching out to find my solid ground
Because I've never known peace lest from above
So up in the clear
I'll find the voice that I hold dear
And I'll send a message to myself

A message to myself
