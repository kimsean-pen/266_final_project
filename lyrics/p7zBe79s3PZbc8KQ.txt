When you said farewell
I didn't think you'd really go, hm
So here comes the sad spell, oh
As my heart expands from the gallows

But this pain I was feeling
Was far from real, I thought you were teasing
I let go of what seemed

I'll spread it out
Wildflowers
Wildflower

You picked me apart
Forget me not
My petals fell
But never began to rot

So now you all know
What was I
This flower I speak of was no buttercup

But this joy I'm now feeling
Is much more real
I begin again as a seedling
Running fire to the field

I'll spread my joy
Wildflower
Wildflowers
Wild
Flowers
Flowers
Wild
Flowers
Flowers

Through the pain we merge,
So much more power
So thank you wildflower
