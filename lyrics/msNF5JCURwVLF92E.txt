The ceiling starts to break, I make the same mistakes
Once or twice a sacrifice, must help for someone else
Hide the way it hurts to hear you're fine without my help

I'm not forever young, the girl you knew is gone
You and I are memories that never seem to fade
Tell the lie you wish that I had begged until you stayed

Ooh, I wanna see you cry
Ooh, I wanna see your dark side
I'll be your satellite
I wonder why I wanna see you cry

I never seem to be, who you want from me
Every time you change your mind, you leave behind a ghost
Everything I knew is now at odds with what I know

Ooh, I wanna see you cry
Ooh, I wanna see your dark side
I'll be your satellite
I wonder why I wanna see you cry

What's missing?
Just listen, I'm no different

Ooh, I wanna see you cry
Ooh, I wanna see your dark side
I'll be your satellite
I wonder why I wanna see you cry
