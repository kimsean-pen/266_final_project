Smacked up again behind the door
Begging please give me some more
A vein that's open for the day
Feel the pulse beneath the skin
And smiling as it all begins
Oh, where have you been?

Judy's staring at the sun
Judy's staring at the sun
Judy's fantasy has come

So amplify this little one, she's a volume freak
She hears as much as she can see
And what she sees she can't believe
It's just that Judy needs a moment of release
To give her peace, peace, peace

Judy's staring at the sun
Judy's staring at the sun
Judy's day passed out of sight
Judy will be suffering tonight
She's suffering

She passed by and said goodbye to him
And in a rare and lucid state
She said, "My days are unoriginal
I wanna fade, fade, fade"

She's suffering
She's suffering
She's suffering

Judy's staring at the sun
She's suffering
Judy's day passed out of sight
She's suffering
Judy will be suffering tonight

She's suffering
She's suffering
She's suffering
