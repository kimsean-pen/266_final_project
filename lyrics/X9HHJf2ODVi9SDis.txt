This name I got we all agreed
She could stop, stop it well rid
We could bind it in the sist-
We could gather, throw a fit

Up to par and Katie bars the kitchen signs but not me in
Set a trap for love, big kill
Don't waste your time sitting still

I'm the sun and you can read
I'm the sign and you're not deaf
We could bind it in the sist-
We could gather, throw a fit

Up to par and Katie bars the kitchen signs but not me in
Set a trap for love, big kill
Don't waste your time sitting still
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you

This name I got we all agree
She could stop, stop it well rid
We could bind it in the sist-
We could gather, throw a fit

Up to par and Katie bars the kitchen signs but not me in
Set a trap for love, big kill
Don't waste your time sitting still
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you

You can gather when I talk, talk until you're blue
You could get away from me, get away from me

I'm up to par and Katie bars the kitchen signs but not me in
Set a trap for love, big kill
Don't waste your time sitting still
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you

I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you
Can you hear me
