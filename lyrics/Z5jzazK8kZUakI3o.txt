Yeah, holla

We come from humble beginnings and
Who could have guessed it when
You sit and doubt it and things ain't all that bright
But we made it through the night, oh
It's like a game of truth or dare

If you can make it here you'll make it anywhere
That's what we've been told
But the story's getting old
Together we faced the cold outside
No one can say we didn't try
And I will never give you up or let you go
Together we faced our final fears
Remember the moments that we shared

That's why I'll never give you up or let you go
We'll be ready when the curtain might fall
Feel my heart beating when the crowd calls
I gotta read between the lines
'Cuz I'm living out the script of my life
'Cuz we all got a part we must play

And I've done it but I've done it my way
I gotta read between the lines
Oh in the script of my life
We started out many years ago no one will ever know
How far we've really come since we walked away
With no more words to say, hey
And we made a lot of sacrifice undid a lot of ties
We fought a lot of fights to get where we are now

Just don't ask me how

Together we faced the cold outside
No one can say we didn't try
And I will never give you up or let you go
Together we faced our final fears
Remember the moments that we shared

That's why I'll never give you up or let you go
We'll be ready when the curtain might fall
Feel my heart beating when the crowd calls
I gotta read between the lines
'Cuz I'm living out the script of my life
'Cuz we all got a part we must play
And I've done it but I've done it my way
I gotta read between the lines

Oh, in the script of my life
We'll be ready when the curtain might fall
Feel my heart beating when the crowd calls
Gotta read between the lines
In the script of my life
We all got a part to play
I've done it but I've done it my way
Gotta read between the lines
In the script of my life
Script of my life
We'll be ready when the curtain might fall
Feel my heart beating when the crowd calls
I gotta read between the lines
'Cuz I'm living out the script of my life
'Cuz we all got a part we must play
And I've done it but I've done it my way
I gotta read between the lines
Oh, common put your hands up
We'll be ready when the curtain might fall
Feel my heart beating when the crowd calls
I gotta read between the lines
'Cuz I'm living out the script of my life
'Cuz we all got a part we must play
And I've done it but I've done it my way
I gotta read between the lines
Oh, in the script of my life
My life, my life
