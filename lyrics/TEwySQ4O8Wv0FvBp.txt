Everything
That you have
Isn't good enough for you
Where you've been,
Where you stand
Isn't good enough for you

Look out of your window,
Look up at the sky
And leave all your sorrow behind

Everything
That you have
Isn't good enough for you
Where you've live,
Where you stand
Isn't good enough for you

There ain't any reason
There ain't any rhyme
Forget while you're sleeping tonight

Everything
That I have
Isn't good enough for me
