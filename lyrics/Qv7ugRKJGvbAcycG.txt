I woke up with a feeling
And found me lying on the floor
I look up at the ceiling
I must be dreaming
When I get that feeling
Oh my Lord I can't take no more
You can't stop that feeling
It just goes on for evermore
What we believe in
Is just a feeling
So thank God for that feeling
Oh my lord I can't take no more
I get the feeling
That I am responding to a call
I am receiving and
I get that meaning
So hats off to that feeling
I could not ask for anymore
