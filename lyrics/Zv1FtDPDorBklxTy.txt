Why'd I have to go and be a fool again?
Why'd I have to go and make a big thing outta nothing?
I didn't know what I had 'til you were gone
It was right in front of me all along
And now those days of "same old story"
Are feeling more like faded glory

I had it all, I threw it all aside
Thinking there was more that I needed to find
I had it all, baby, 'til you went away
Blue skies, sunshine and butterflies
Those were the conditions that I left behind
Why did I let it go to waste?
I had it all

So where are all the fireworks I thought I'd see?
I still haven't found the magic I was looking for
That made me leave
I traded in my comfort zone
For empty nights of being alone

I had it all, I threw it all aside
Thinking there was more that I needed to find
I had it all, baby, 'til you went away
Blue skies, sunshine and butterflies
Those were the conditions that I left behind
Why did I let it go to waste?

Why did I believe that little voice
That lead me down the path to this bad choice?
Why don't I listen to the angels when they sing
And they sing, oh yeah

I had it all, I threw it all aside
Thinking there was more that I needed to find
I had it all, baby, 'til you went away
Blue skies, sunshine and butterflies
Those were the conditions that I left behind
Why did I let it go to waste?
I had it all
Why did I let it go to waste?
I had it all

Why'd I have to go and be a fool again?
