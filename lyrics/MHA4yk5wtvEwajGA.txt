I found a letter in the mailbox today
And I said, "thank you for your thoughts, but I'm done."
I said that I would never build this up right here
And he said, "that's why I can't work with you son."

But I can't let this go I'm on my way
You can only hold my diamond ring
But I'll go crawling back to the city I love
Cause it's already taken everything

I'm going to Coney Island have myself a dog
And reminisce why I still hate it here
It's all these people with their cotton candy eyes
It's so sweet, now put the train in gear

But I can't let this go I'm on my way
You can only hold my diamond ring
But I'll go crawling back to the city I love
Cause it's already taken everything

The ground is swallowing my options full release
And if it rains they might just disappear
I counted 27 birds up there today
I'm thinking that's why I still love it here
I'm thinking that's why I still love it here

But I can't let this go I'm on my way
You can only hold my diamond ring
But I'll go crawling back to the city I love
Cause it's already taken everything
Cause it's already taken everything
