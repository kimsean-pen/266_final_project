This is the land
That we earned
Dressed in colours
We would burn
But did I
Hold you close?

And lord only knows
If you're happy now
And lord only knows
Where you are
Look at me now
In no man's land
Waiting for
The sun to return

The light
Takes a way ward turn
And lights
The scorched earth
Beyond return
I didn't
Hold you close

And lord only knows
Af you're happy now
And lord only knows
Where you are
But look at me now
In no man's land
Waiting for
The sun to return.
