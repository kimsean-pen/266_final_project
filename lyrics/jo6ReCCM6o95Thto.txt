I've got sunshine in my stomach
Like I just rocked my baby to sleep
I've got sunshine in my stomach
But I can't keep me from creeping sleep
Sleep, deep in the deep

Rockface moves to press my skin
White liquids turn sour within
Turn fast-turn sour
Turn sweat-turn sour
Must tell myself that I'm not here
I'm drowning in a liquid fear
Bottled in a strong compression
My distortion shows obsession
In the cave
Get me out of this cave
If I keep my self-control
I'll be safe in my soul
And the childhood belief
Brings a moment's relief
But my cynic soon returns
And the lifeboat burns
My spirit just never learns
Stalactites, stalagmites
Shut me in, lock me tight
Lips are dry, throat is dry
Feel like burning, stomach churning
I'm dressed up in a white costume
Padding out leftover room
Body stretching, feel the wretching
In the cage
Get me out of the cage
In the glare of a light
I see a strange kind of sight
Of cages joined to form a star
Each person can't go very far
All tied to their things
They're netted by their strings
Free to flutter in memories of their wasted wings

Outside the cage I see my Brother John
He turns his head so slowly round
I cry out help before he can be gone
And he looks at me without a sound
And I shout 'John, please help me'
But he does not even want to try to speak
I'm helpless in my violent rage
And a silent tear of blood dribbles down his cheek
And I watch him turn away and leave the cage
My little runaway

In a trap, feel a strap
Holding still, pinned for kill
Chances narrow that I'll make it
In the cushioned straight-jacket
Just like 22nd Street
When they got me by my neck and feet
Pressures building, can't take any more
My headaches charge, my earaches roar
In the pain
Get me out of this pain
If I could change to liquid
I could fill the cracks up in the rock
But I know that I am solid
And I am my own bad luck
Outside John disappears and my cage dissolves
Without any reason my body revolves

Keep on turning
Keep on turning
Keep on turning
Keep on turning
Keep on turning
Turning around
Spinning around
