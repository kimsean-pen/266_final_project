California tears
Tell me stories
Of the sad years
You endure

You ain't gonna live
Avoiding
The water
You won't go
To waste
You won't
Erase
The California tears, tears, tears,
California tears

Horizons
Above our heads
We aren't liars
We aren't liars

To wonderful
Mournful days
To wonder, and fall
To wander, and fall

Embrace
California tears
They're gifts from
The ocean, oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)

Your face
Tells me stories
Of the sad years
You endured

Hold the centre
Of earth
And cry its ocean
To California

To taste
Your calling
To feel
Your falling
It's all inside me
Your sadness rising
