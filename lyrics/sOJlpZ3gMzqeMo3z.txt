Consume, just like a worm
Catch a glimpse of the sun through cracks
Everything, I swallow whole
And hide before the flood

The way I see things
I wish they could be true
But take me all the way
The trail of the torment
Is not a path anymore
But take me for a ride

Delete the past, the fear
Delete the past, every step is pure
Delete the past from here, forward
Delete the past, every step is pure

Afraid of lost control
Still there's a part of me that wants to feel insecure
Afraid of lost control
It keeps me on the edge

Delete the past, the fear
Delete the past, every step is pure
Delete the past from here, forward
Delete the past, every step is pure

The way I see things
I wish they could be true
But take me all the way

Delete the past, the fear, forward
Delete the past, every step is pure
Delete the past from here, forward
Delete the past, every step is pure
