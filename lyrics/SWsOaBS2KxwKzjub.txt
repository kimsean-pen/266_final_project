Stay close to home, my lovely daring boy
You got the world at your feet
You ain't heard much yet but my raspy little voice
Telling you, come on, come clean
Just one more drink, you'll say
Before you're back on that wagon for sure
One day I'll be the one to see you behind those bars
Then you'll say I should have loved that girl more
The road seems too wild for mixing your blues
You're going to bed far too late
You're way too sweet to leave me for so long
But it'll make sense while I wait
Just one more sip you'll say
Before you're gone, gone out that door
One day I'll be the one to see you behind those bars
Then you'll say I should have loved that girl more
Just one more drink, you'll say
Before you're back on the wagon for sure
But one day I'll be the one to see you behind those bars
And you'll say I should have loved that girl more
