Oh my goodness, I can't hide it
You just smiled when you walked by me
Oh... my goodness
Warning signs that no one showed me
Lost control but please don't hold me back
Gonna go for it
I hope your ready for it
Oh oh...

'Cause I don't know
If I can stop now
I'm going too fast, heart first
My head just can't slow me down
And I don't care
If you don't break my fall
You got me dreaming of a life
That anybody else would die for

I'm rolling down hill, no breaks
Can't go back now, it's too late oh
It's too late to look away
And unfeel what i feel for you look away
And unsee what i see in you
I gonna go for it
I hope you ready cos

I don't know
If I can stop now
I'm going too fast, heart first
My head just can't slow me down
And I don't care
If you don't break my fall
You got me dreaming of a life
That anybody else would die for

Oh baby
Anybody else would die for...

First sight i believed in first sight
No second thoughts in my mind just felt right
Ohhh my goodness
Oh

'Cause I don't know
If I can stop now
Im going too fast, heart first
My head just can't slow me down
And I don't care
If you don't break my fall
You got me dreaming of a life
That anybody else would die for

I've been dreaming of a life that anybody else would die for
Anybody else would die for
