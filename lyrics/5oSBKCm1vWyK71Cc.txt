I've been losing all sense of control
Lunacy is on a roll
I've been screaming your name
But I can't find you nowhere
Not here nor there, not anywhere

The books are closed on you and I
That cannot be denied
The memories fade as the years pass by
This is the last goodbye
A cold kiss,
Then we'll fade into the night

I've been dreaming of an open door
A lucid gateway to what was before
My emotions been shattered
I'm better off forsaken
On the distant horizon, a placid shore

I turned my back on thee
You turned your back on me
For the years we shared in life
Are now lost somewhere in time
Fading on inside

Deepening darkness, waning light
Falling into the embrace of the night
Cunning chaos, gathering storms
Here comes devastation in all its forms

Starless night skies, frozen lands
The time has come for the plague to descend
It's all written in tears and blood
Here's the breakdown, impending flood
