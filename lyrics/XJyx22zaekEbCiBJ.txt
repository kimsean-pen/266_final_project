I guess I just feel like
I guess I just feel like
Nobody's honest
Nobody's true
Everyone's lying
To make it on through
I guess I just feel like
I'm the same way too

I guess I just feel like
Good things are gone
And the weight of my worries
Is too much to take on

I think I remember
This dream that I had
This love's gonna save us
From a world that's gone mad
I guess I just feel like
What happened to that

I guess I just feel like
The joke's getting old
The future is fading
And the past is on hold

But I know that I'm open
And I know that I'm free
And I'll always let hope in
Wherever I'll be
And if I go blind I'll still find my way
I guess I just felt like
Giving up today
