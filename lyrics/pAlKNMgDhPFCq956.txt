I don't pretend to have the answers
Never said I held the key
But somehow they see
A light inside of me
Am I not the man who I was meant to be?

As the people gather 'round me
I never felt so all alone
Is this the chance to be someone?
My moment in the sun?
Why am I afraid of facing the unknown?

They are finding faith in me
And they believe I'm The One
To set them free.
