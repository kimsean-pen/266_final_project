Running into one another
Outside a cafe in Paris
You say you're living with your brother
Because he lets you stay rent free
But you can't speak the local language
And so no matter how you try
You say you don't know how you'll manage
Since the death of you and I

Running into one another
Feelings come flooding back again
You say you've been with many others
But that it never tastes the same
And now you don't know how to feel
Wiping tears from your eyes
Nothing never felt so real
Since the death of you and I

Since the death of you and I
Since the death of you and I
Since the death of you and I

Running into one another
You say you wanna run and hide
Cause you still haven't recovered
From the day that Olive died
So am I wasting all my time
Tryna make it up to you
Well if you said that you were mine
There's not a thing that I would do

Since the death of you and I
Since the death of you and I
Since the death of you and I

Said the missings couldn't be forgiven
Praying at the altar but the gods don't listen
Life without your love ain't a life worth living
Tried to go along but there's something missing
I got nothing left
Since the death of you and I
Stronghold starts with no direction
Sobriety bites like your last rejection
It's been seven long days since the ressurection
Remember when your body was my confection
I got nothing left
Since the death of you and I

Since the death of you and I
Since the death of you and I
Since the death of you and I
I
