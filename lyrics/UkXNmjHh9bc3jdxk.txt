The fire, the wine, the bed and you
In this crimson light I find the truth
And truth is like a punch or two
It hits you hard, it knocks you through

So I get on the road and ride to you
I get on the road and ride to you

Kiss like a fight that neither wins
One tender payment for our sins
You are the drug that I can't quit
Your perfect chaos is a perfect fit

So I get on the road and ride to you
I get on the road and ride to you

From broken farm to broken farm
The engine noise like an alarm
It breathes a thunder in my soul
Its starts this race through the dust bowl

So I get on the road and ride to you
I get on the road and ride to you

The wheel it settles in my hand
This is the measure of this man
I point the car at north, at you
The route has scarred this country through

So I get on the road and ride to you
I get on the road and ride to you
I get on the road and ride to you
I get on the road and ride to you
