I va-va-voom into the room
And all the heads spin
I strike a pose, they all applaud
I know they wanna get it in
I'm super sleek and super sexy
And all the boys talk
About my legs for days
They see me walking the walk
Into the bedroom, to the bathhouse
You think I'm too much
But when I'm crawling on my knees
You can look but don't touch
Because my heart belongs to daddy
And daddy knows best
He leaves the coins on the dresser
Rococo on my chest
He gives me rhinestones, diamonds
You know what I'm on
He likes my cake, he likes to eat it
And leaves me climbing the walls
But when I wake up in the morning
All I wanna see
Is a little less you and a lot more me
From the kitchen down the hallway
Out the door and all along(?)
He loves my lingerie
And when I turn myself on
It's tough love, it's tough lust
He takes the back of my hand
And when he hands out all the handouts
It's according to my plan
I plead my fame, I plead my fortune
I keep it hush-hush
I take my time and I tease him
You know I never rush
He likes my taste he likes my waist
He likes the cream of my crop
And when I'm done
I am the one
Always ending up on top
He gives me rhinestones, diamonds
You know what I'm on
He likes my cake, he likes to eat it
And leave me climbing the walls
But when I wake up in the morning
All I wanna see
Is a little less you and a lot more me
You're all crazy and lazy
And waiting for me to read
See all the beads on my neck
You know what I mean?
I need a man that understands
And won't try to be cheap
Cause when I leave you in the dark
It's all your assets I keep
He gives me rhinestones, diamonds
You know what I'm on
I want my cake, I wanna eat it
Leave me climbing the walls
But when I wake up in the morning
All I wanna be
Is a little less you and a lot more me
That's right
Uh-huh
More me
