I see it in your eyes
That you wanna tell me something
And I feel it, see the signs
That you wanna tell me something
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And I know we haven't been easy
But is it cause for us giving it up?
I know you've got your reasons

So if you're gonna do it
Then baby just do it
Don't let me down gently
If you're gonna do it
Then baby just do it
I'll get over it eventually

You ask me: How many times do you think we'll be on and off again?
And I'll tell you: Just this time
'Cause I don't think that I could do it all again, oh no

And I know it hasn't been easy
But is it cause for us giving it up?
I know you've got your reasons

So if you're gonna do it
Then baby just do it
Don't let me down gently
If you're gonna do it
Then baby just do it
I'll get over it eventually

Before I'm too invested
Don't make your words selective

If you're gonna do it
Then baby just do it
Don't let me down gently

Oh oh baby, at least it would be better than this
Baby, at least it would be better than this

So if you're gonna do it
Then baby just do it
Don't let me down gently (it would be better)
If you're gonna do it
Then baby just do it
I'll get over it eventually (it would be better)

Before I'm too invested
Don't make your words selective

If you're gonna do it
Then baby just do it
Don't let me down gently (it would be better)
