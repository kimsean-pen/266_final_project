even though you are alone,
Darkness lies awake for you
and sees you through until dawn
begins to shine.
Even though you are afraid,
Morning comes to save you and sees
you through
until fear begins again
we all count for days.
we shout all for nights
and when you fall asleep
we dance, dance, dance
in your dreams until the
dawn begins to shine
