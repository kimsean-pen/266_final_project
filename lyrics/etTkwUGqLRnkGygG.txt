How I worry about you
No one to pull you out of the blue
Anger and sadness get the best of you
Your words choked by a weak tongue
Too sad to be so young
Dependence on despair will get you nowhere

This time, this time where did you go
You're not alone, where did you go
This time, this time you're not alone
Where did you go
You're not alone

Wish I could erase the pain
To better help you survive another day
Your words choked by a weak tongue
Too sad to be so young
Dependence on despair will get you nowhere

Spend everyday by your side,
Till I know that you're alright
Till I know you're alright
