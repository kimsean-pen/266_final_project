Met you up at the Hollywood sign
Bright red tongue and a handful of red vines
Fifteen bottles of Corona and lime
Smashed them all, yeah she's out of her mind
Took my hand and she took off her clothes
Handed me a smoke from the back of her Volvo
Pulled my hair and she's ready to go
Pinned me down and i'm ready to blow

Stop, there's a million stars
In the sky tonight
Lay your head down next to mine
There's a million lights
And the city burns
With a fire that glows all night
All night
All night
And the airplanes fly cross the midnight sky
See the flashing lights

Cops rolled up at a quarter to three
She said "if I'm going down then you're going down with me"
Tossed the drugs and got rid of the weed
One last kiss 'fore they tell us to leave
So much fun what a sad way to end
Still hung up from that magical weekend
Last I heard she was spotted in Portland
Been two years haven't seen her again

Stop, there's a million stars
In the sky tonight
Lay your head down next to mine
There's a million lights
And the city burns
With a fire that glows all night
All night
All night
And the airplanes fly cross the midnight sky
See the flashing lights

Pull up to the station see her face in all the magazines
Sitting on the sofa tryna drink away the memory
Right about now I start to wonder if she thinks of me
Wonder if she thinks of me
First time that I met her didn't think that we would get along
Not until she told me "Billie Jean" was her favorite song
From that day I knew that she was all that I could ever want
All that I could ever want

Stop, there's a million stars
In the sky tonight
Lay your head down next to mine
There's a million lights
And the city burns
With a fire that glows all night
All night
All night
And the airplanes fly cross the midnight sky
See the flashing lights
