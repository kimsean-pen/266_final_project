Sometimes I wish that I was there
Because only livin can feel pain
Sometimes I wish that I could fly
It's so grounded and life pass you by

Hey little girl running on
Hear the day and then you go
Before we ride it to the sun
Get it all

Sometimes your world is full of pain
it's so hurt inside and drive.
sometimes the worlds you gotta say
get so trapped inside and fade away

Hey little girl running on
Hear the day and then you go
Before we ride it to the sun
Get it all

Hey little girl running on
Hear the day and then you go
Before we ride it to the sun
Get it all

Hey little girl running on
Hear the day and then you go
Before we ride it to the sun
Get it all

Hey little girl running on
Hear the day and then you go
Before we ride it to the sun
Get it all

Hey little girl running on
Hear the day and then you go
Before we ride it to the sun
Get it all
