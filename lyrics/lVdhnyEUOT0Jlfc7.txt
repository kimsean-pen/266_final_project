We had howl

We had run around
In the summer in the nighttime
We made no sound
And deep in the forest we get lost
Whistle to the Birds as they call
Go on Trips
Moving with weather as it shifts
We took to the seas and let it drift
How many islands could we hear?

I'd follow you
To the end of the world if only you would ask me to
On and on we go, my brother
I've got you
Nothing to stop us now
Because we found in life what's true
Oh my brother I'd follow you

In my faded truck
We shot across the country to find our luck
And the youth inside would scream and shout
Like a dagger in the heart we ripped it out

And we had laugh through the night
Call the star's
By the fire shining on
Through the night
We will run
To the rising life and on
Through the night
Burn the flames
The world will know our Names

And I'd follow you
To the end of the world if only you would ask me to
On and on we go, my brother
I've got you
Nothing to stop us now
Because we found in life what's true
Oh my brother I'd follow you
I'd follow you
To the end of the world if only you would ask me to
On and on we go, my brother
I've got you
Nothing to stop us now
Because we found in life what's true
And I will follow you!
