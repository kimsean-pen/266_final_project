We can do anything that we want, we can, we can,
we can, we can do anything that we want

Why you gotta play that song so loud?
Because we want to! Because we want to!
Why you always run around in crowds?
Because we want to! Because we want to!
Why d'you always have to dance all night?
Because we want to! Because we want to!
Why d' you always say what's on your mind?
Because we want to! Because we want to!

Don't try to tell me
What I already know
Don't critisize me
'Cos I'm running this show
Some revolution
Is going to happen today
I'm gonna chase the dark clouds away
Come on and help me sing it

We can do what we want to do
We can do anything
Free to be who we want to be
Just tell yourself you can do it!

Why you gotta play that song so loud?
Because we want to! Because we want to!
Why you always run around in crowds?
Because we want to! Because we want to!
Why d'you always have to dance all night?
Because we want to! Because we want to!
Why d' you always say what's on your mind?
Because we want to! Because we want to!

I'll throw a party
For the world and my friends
We'll take life easy
The music never ends
Perfect solution
To the stress and the strain
I know the sun will follow the rain
Come on and help me sing it

We can do what we want to do
We can do anything
Free to be who we want to be
Just tell yourself you can do it

Why you gotta play that song so loud?
Because we want to! Because we want to!
Why you always run around in crowds?
Because we want to! Because we want to!
Why d'you always have to dance all night?
Because we want to! Because we want to!
Why d' you always say what's on your mind?
Because we want to! Because we want to!

We can do anything that we want, we can, we can,
we can, we can do anything that we want

So shake it, move it, use the groove
Go with the flow and take over the show
Let me tell you it's sweet and it's an up-beat
Me and the crew, there's nothing we can do

If you wanna catch this vibe then get with us

Come on and help me sing it
We can do what we want to do
We can do anything
Free to be who we want to be
Just tell yourself you can do it

Why you gotta play that song so loud?
Because we want to! Because we want to!
Why you always run around in crowds?
Because we want to! Because we want to!
Why d'you always have to dance all night?
Because we want to! Because we want to!
Why d' you always say what's on your mind?
Because we want to! Because we want to!
