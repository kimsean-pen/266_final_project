A drum of unrest
Beating in my chest
Within raging days
Pounding at the gate
Skin stretched too tight
Under fading light
Shapeless failing view

I must see it through
Must see it through
See it through
Sounding unto a greater life
Bring the devils
Seraphim
Bring the sorrow
That feeds on my skin
Sounding unto a greater sight
See the seer
The original face
There is nothing else
This is all there is
There is nothing else
The original face
Blister to the flame
Bared teeth within names
One beast brings its strength
One beast brings hunger
One beast topples mountains
Rigpa swallows them whole
Emergent rising view
I must see it through
Must see it through
Sounding unto a greater life
Bring the devils
Seraphim
Bring the leeches
Bleed the leeches
Sounding unto a greater sight
See the seer
The original face
Skin stretched too tight
Under fading light
Shapeless failing view
Must see it through
Blister to the flame
Bared teeth within names
Clear sight, Rigpa's view
I must see it through

Must see it through
