In the hand of a liar
You well read sick offend
But later call men a liar
And while you sweet talk,

now what those people did to you
in your blood red youth
now what those people did to you
in your blood red youth
now what those people did to you
in your blood red youth
now what those people did to you
in your blood red youth

when your information's out
and your head's full of light
and they serve you a drink
like you hope they might
and when you bring it down,
bring it down
since it's raining and fog
now what those people did to you
in your blood red youth

now what those people did to you
in your blood red youth
now what those people did to you
in your blood red youth
now what those people did to you
in your blood red youth
now what those people did to you
in your blood red youth

now what those people did to you
in your blood red youth
now what those people did to you
in your blood red youth
now what those people did to you
in your blood red youth
now what those people did to you
in your blood red
in your blood red
in your blood red
