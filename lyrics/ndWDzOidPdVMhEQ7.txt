I believe, I believe there's love in you
Grid locked on the dusty avenues
Inside your heart, just afraid to go
I am more, I am more than innocent
But just take a chance and let me in
And I'll show you ways that you don't know
Don't complicate it
Don't let the past dictate
Yeaaah
I have been patient, but slowly I'm losing faith
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
I believe, I believe you could love me
But you're lost on the road to misery
And what I gave to you
I could never get back!
Don't complicate it
Don't drive yourself insane
Yeaaah
Say what you will but I know that you want to stay!
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
Chemicals rushing in
I know where I belong to
I'm fighting like a cannonball in the air
Crushing into who I belong to
Uuuh uh, uuuuh uuuuh uh
I have been patient, but slowly I'm losing faith
Please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
Please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
The shadows of your heart
Are hanging in the sweet, sweet air
I know you baby
The secrets that you hide, control us and it's just not fair
I know you baby
