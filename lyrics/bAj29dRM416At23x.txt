Oh now the lonely nights begin,
and there is nowhere left to go,
but watch my spirit melt away,
down at the D-I-S-C-O.
I must have died a thousand times,
The next day, I was still alive.
And I still believe in you,
Yes I do.
Let's do it now.
No. I was not crushed, I did not cry
You know that everything's O.K.
It's just sometimes I wake at night,
All alone and see your face.
Oh, thousands feel the same,
but the night-time falls away.
Oh no but still sometimes I feel,
oh sometimes I feel like Jesus Christ now, Hey,
I feel this night will never end,
and I will never see the day.
Oh I was nothing when you came,
I'm no-one now you've gone away.
Oh all I do is just O.K.
All of my nights,
and all of my days.
Oh-oh if you came home right now,
I'd run away,
Oh run away now.
O.K. now
Alright.
You can go out and make love to whoever, or whatever you like babe
So I go out and fill my eyes with other women,
Oh they look good to me and I think that I might kiss them,
Oh now it's two a.m. and I'm still stood here waiting,
so I go home and wonder why I bothered going.
Yeah every week turns out the same,
the sun, the wind, the snow, the rain.
Oh no but still sometimes I feel,
oh sometimes I feel like Jesus Christ now, Hey,
I feel this night will never end,
and I will never see the day.
Oh I was nothing when you came,
I'm no-one now you've gone away.
Oh all I do is just O.K.
All of my nights, and all of my days.
Oh-oh if you came home right now,
I'd run away.
I can't believe it.
I can't remember your face anymore.
Or the sound of your voice.
Or any touch of your skin,
is a legend.
By the way,
did I tell you that I loved you?
Oh if I didn't I'm so sorry.
You know I,
I really,
I really meant to tell you.
It's O.K. there's no need to hurry.
But the bed is full of memories,
full of memories of you.
Oh I've tried to get them out but,
but there's nothing I can do.
Oh if I knew the moon I'd ask him,
Shine his light in through your window,
and send your body home to me today.
Hey,
I feel this night will never end,
and I will never see the day,
Oh I was nothing when you came,
I'm no-one now you've gone away
Oh all I do is O.K.
All of my nights,
and all of my days.
Oh-oh if you came home right now,
I'd run away,
Run away,
Run away.
