A cupid on the go
No arrow and no bow,
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I thought you'd gone for good
I hadn't understood
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Rushing like the sea
You've come back to me
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
In you now
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
In you now

The Maker of a dream
The lead in every scene
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I needed to survive
Without you I would die
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Rushing like the sea
You've come back to me
And I would say

I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
In you now
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
In you now

Dreaming
I'm dreaming of the now
Hold me now
Don't leave now...

I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
In you now
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
In you now
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer
In you now
