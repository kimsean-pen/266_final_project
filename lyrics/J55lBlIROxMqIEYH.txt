I need a summer but the summer's come and gone
I need a summer but it's winter in my heart
It's all the same fucked up game you play with me
I need to hold you but you're never coming back

I can't get, any lower
I can't find all the pieces of my broken life

I need a summer but the summer's come and gone
I need a summer like a winter in my heart

I can't get, any lower
I can't find all the pieces of my broken life

But I try, I still try
I still try
