I call upon the raven
And the bat!
And all the dark creatures of nature
Upon the charred and blacked cloud that rained at your beginning

Hail the ghost rip apart the host
Your bloody nightmare

Hexing the voice crucify the choice
Crushed in your name

Destroyed twisting breaking bending
To put you in your grave

Slipping down the wall clutching
Tear out your fingernails

Evoke the words that bleed
Tear apart space and time

Make my black heart sing
Through all the suffering
Deaf from a million christs
Blind for the one who dies

Hail the ghost rip apart the host
Your bloody nightmare

Hexing the voice crucify the choice
Crushed in your name

Slipping down the walls clutching
Tear out your fingernails

Evoke the words that bleed
Tear apart space and time

Evoke the power that feeds

Make my black heart sing
Through all the suffering
Deaf from a million christs
Blind for the one who dies
