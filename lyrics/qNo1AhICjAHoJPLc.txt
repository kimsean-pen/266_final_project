Hello there, my old friend
Not so long ago it was 'til the end
We played outside in the pourin' rain
On our way up the road, we started over again
You're livin' our dream as though you on top
My mind is achin', Lord it won't stop
That's how it happens livin' life by the drop

Up and down that road in our worn out shoes
Talkin' 'bout good thangs and singin' the blues
You went your way and I stayed behind
We both knew it was just a matter of time
Livin' our dream as though you on top
My mind is achin', Lord it won't stop
That's how it happens livin' life by the drop

No wasted time, we're alive today
Churnin' up the past, there's no easier way
Time's been between us, a means to an end
God, it's good to be here walkin' together, my friend
Livin' a dream
My mind starts achin'
That's how it happens livin' life by the drop

That's how it happens livin' life by the drop
That's how it happens livin' life by the drop
