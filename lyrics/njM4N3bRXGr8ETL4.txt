Sitting up there so high you'll never get to look at something like you would from the bottom
It's lonely staring down at everyone
Where am I gonna go when there's nowhere left to climb?
I could just take a little bit less
I could just take it slow and
Be here now for a moment
I know I've been away for a while
I know I've been forgetting
What it's like when I let it
I'm trying hard to treat it like a wave
Or when I feel it be, like wind in a tunnel
Like I'm watching a candle while it dims
Since I remember it's been burning like dead leaves in my head
I could just take a little bit less
I could just take it slow and
Be here now for a moment
I know I've been away for a while
I know I've been forgetting
What it's like when I let it
If you don't want to be here now
No one's making you wait and
You're the only one who could know
All it is, 'cause you made it
I could just take a little bit less
I could just take it slow and
Be here now for a moment
I know I've been away for a while
I know I've been forgetting
What it's like when I let it
