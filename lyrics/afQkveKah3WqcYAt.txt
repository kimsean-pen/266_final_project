I wanna be like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
And walk right into the fire
If only I could know the truth in love
Then I would be so bold
Melt my idol of gold

I wanna be like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
And see the fourth man in the fire
And if he is everything that I hope
Then I would be so bold
Melt my idol of gold

I wanna be like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
And walk right out of the fire
With no burn upon my skin
Or on my clothes
Then I would be so bold
Melt my idol of gold
I would be so bold
Melt my idol of gold
