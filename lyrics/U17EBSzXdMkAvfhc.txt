The blooming flower will never dry out
And our greatest strength lies in the
gentleness and tenderness of our hearts
Chasing the wind cause I wanna hear it's whispered words

Sparkling eyes are back
Which were faded for so long

My love is like a melody
That's sweetly played in tune
Let us blend our souls as one

Sometimes when I look at you I feel I'm gazing at a distant star

Sparkling eyes are back
Which were faded for so long

My love is like a melody
That's sweetly played in tune
Let us blend our souls as one

Let's write the empty pages to the book of love
Tell me where all the time has gone

Like a butterfly unfolds it's graceful wings
The sould would have no rainbow if the clouds were always grey
Like a butterfly unfolds it's graceful wings
Like a butterfly unfolds it's graceful wings

My love is like a melody
That's sweetly played in tune
Let us blend our souls as one

Let's write the empty pages to the book of love
Tell me where all the time has gone
