If falling in love is criminal
Then put me in jail I give it up
Out of line everytime
If love is a crime then stop me now
'Cause you are my kind of criminal
Out of line

Oooh
Oooh
Stop me now, wonder if

If falling apart is criminal
Let's get it together, we fuck it all
Out of the line everytime
They push me too far, I give it up
We're up and about, we 'll burn it all
Everytime

We sit in the dock and we don't care
We'll be standing in their way as they come in
Oooh
The rest of the world, well we don't care
We'll be standing in their way as they come in
Oooh

There is no coming back to a straight life
Everyday and every night, we're out of line
Oooh
Everyday, everytime, we shut our mouth
To cross the gate, ready I am

All the time

Oooh
Oooh-oooh
Oooh
Oooh-oooh
Oooh
Oooh-oooh
Time

If falling in love is criminal
If love is a crime then stop me now
If falling apart is criminal
I'm ready to become a criminal
A criminal
A criminal
A criminal
