Drive boy, dive boy
Dirty numb angel boy
In the doorway boy
She was a lipstick boy
She was a beautiful boy
And tears boy
And all in your inner space boy
You had
Hand girls boy
And steel boy
You had chemicals boy
I've grown so close to you
Boy and you just groan boy
She said come over, come over

She smiled at you boy

Drive boy, dive boy
Dirty numb angel boy
In the doorway boy
She was a lipstick boy
She was a beautiful boy
And tears boy
And all in your inner space boy
You had
Hand girls boy
And steel boy
You had chemicals boy

I've grown so close to you

Boy and you just groan boy
She said come over, come over
She smiled at you boy

Let your feelings slip boy
But never your mask boy
Random blonde bio high density random
Blonde boy blonde country blonde high density
You are my drug boy
You're real boy
Speak to me and boy dog
Dirty numb cracking boy
You getting wet boy

Big, big time boy

Acid bear boy

Babes and babes and babes and babes and babes
And remembering nothing boy
You like my tear hole boy

It gets wet like an angel
Derailed

(You got a velvet mouth
You're so succulent and beautiful
Shimmering and dirty
Wonderful and hot times
On your telephone line
And God and everything
On your telephone
And in walks an angel)

And look at me mum
Squatting pissed in a tube hole at Tottenham Court Road
I just come out of The Ship
Talking to the most
Blonde I ever met
Shouting
Lager, lager, lager, lager
Shouting
Lager lager, lager lager
Shouting
Lager, lager, lager, lager
Shouting
Lager, lager, lager, lager
Shouting
Mega, mega white thing
Mega, mega white thing
Mega, mega white thing
Mega, mega
Shouting lager, lager, lager, lager
Mega, mega white thing
Mega, mega white thing
So many things to see and do
In the tube hole true
Blonde going back to Romford
Mega, mega, mega going back to Romford
How am I at having fun?
I know why you're on your way
To a new tension
Headache
