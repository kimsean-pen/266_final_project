I'd seen your face before
It arrived at my door
It was bawling, it was bawling

I wrapped you up inside my arms
I wanted you to feel warm
Snow was falling, it was falling

I never knew a thing unclean
I swore I'd never be obscene
Again for your love, again for your love

You took me inside your heart
You drafted up a brand new start
For the calling, for the calling

If it wasn't for the bad disease
That crept up inside of me
It was mauling, it was mauling

Well, I tried to stay true
To everyone inside of you
But my best wasn't good enough
No, my best wasn't good enough for the rest of us

Teach me a song, don't let me go
Teach me a song, don't let me go
If you want to love me, I'll stay along
Teach me a song, don't let me go

Teach me a song, don't let me go
Teach me a song, don't let me go
If you want to love me, I'll stay along
Teach me a song, don't let me go
