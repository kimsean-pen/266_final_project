War
The very first war of our world
When the treacherous witch was killed
Three times burned, the three times born
By searing flames was Gullveig torn
Death
Odin hurled his spear up with great force
Deep into the great vana-fyrd
Battle horns gave up their sound
And Asgard walls razed to the ground

The Vanir felt deceived
Hænir was a fool
Without Mímir at his side Hænir could not rule
In a field of violent rage
Mímir's blood was shed
And to Odin's court they sent Mímir's severed head

Truce
So a brittle and frail peace was forged
And to ensure that the peace remained
Njordr and Freyr to Asgard came
And Hænir and Mim to Vanaheim
Death
See the furious gods wanting blood
Odin knew that the raging war
Would not bring them any gain
Just leave a black and bitter stain

Odin tog huvudet och smorde det med örter
Som hindrar det från att ruttna
Han kvad sina trollsånger över det
Så att Mimer åter kunde tala till honom

The Vanir felt deceived
Hænir was a fool
Without Mímir at his side Hænir could not rule
In a field of violent rage
Mímir's blood was shed
And to Odin's court they sent Mímir's severed head
The Vanir felt deceived
Hænir was a fool
Without Mímir at his side Hænir could not rule
In a field of violent rage
Mímir's blood was shed
And to Odin's court they sent Mímir's severed head
