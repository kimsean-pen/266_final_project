Turn her over
A candle is lit, I see through her
Blow it out and save all her ashes for me

Curse me sold her
The poison that runs its course through her
Pale white skin with strawberry gashes all over all over

Watch me fault her
You're living like a disaster
She said kill me faster
With strawberry gashes all over

Called her over
and asked her if she was improving
She said, "Feels fine,
It's wonderful, wonderful here"

Hex me, told her
I dreamt of a devil that knew her
Pale white skin with strawberry gashes all over, all over

Watch me fault her
You're living like a disaster
She said kill me faster
With strawberry gashes all over, all over

I lay quiet
Waiting for her voice to say
"Some things you lose,
and some things you just give away"

Scold me failed her
If only I'd held on tighter to her
Pale white skin
That twisted and withered away from me, away from me

Watch me lose her
It's almost like losing myself
Give her my soul
and let them take somebody else
Get away from me

Watch me fault her
You're living like a disaster
She said kill me faster
With strawberry gashes all over, all over me
