Stiff club
It's my nature
Custom love
Is the nomenclature
Turn down
Mass confusion
Hit the road
'Cause we just keep cruisin'
Double my fun
Double my vision
Long hard look
At my last decision
Hustle here
Hustle there
Hustle me bitch
And you best beware

It's emotional
And I told you so
But you had to know
So I told you

Soft walk
To horizon
One big crash
That no one dies in
This for the folks in Fayetteville
It'll come true if you say it will

Look around
Look around
Look around
All around
All around
All around
Look around
Look around
Look around
All around
All around
All around

It's emotional
And I told you so
But you had to know
So I told you

Please don't look right through me
Hurts my heart
When you do that to me
Street life
Out my window
City made breeze
Gonna stroke my skindow
Just a lotta words
On an old brick wall
Robbin' lotta banks
Gotta pedigree scrawl
Put my peg
Into your square
Run around like we just don't care

Look around
Look around
Look around
All around
All around
All around
Look around
Look around
Look around
All around
Oh yeah

Woo!

Move it ah gotta get ya, wanna get you
Move it ah gotta get ya, wanna get you
Move it ah gotta get ya, wanna get you
Move it ah gotta get ya, wanna get you
Move it ah gotta get ya, wanna get you
Move it ah gotta get ya, wanna get you
Move it ah gotta get ya, wanna get you
Move it ah gotta get ya, gonna get you!

Look around
Look around
Look around
All around
All around
All around
Look around
Look around
Look around
All around
Oh yeah

When I'm feeling small and I'm
hitting a wall
Wanna feel it all around
When I'm feeling small and I'm
hitting a wall
Wanna feel it all around
