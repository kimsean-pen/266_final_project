Approach the image filled with fear
As the image grows so clear
Future now takes full control
The one whose past you now behold
Touch - The flesh it is so cold
Turn away - You now have been told
Never to return, Memories will last
In the future, You'll think about the past
Never to forget, What you have seen

People come to pay respect
Taking pictures of the dead
That is what life comes to be
Once they lived, Now they're deceased

Death is oh so strange
The past no one can change
What you can't predict
Is how long you'll exist
Open casket - Open casket

Life will never be the same
Death can never be explained
It's their time to go beyond
Empty feeling when they're gone

Never to return, Memories will last
In the future, You'll think about the past
Never to forget, What you have seen
What can not be real you now believe
