The False Contender

I once had a love but soon had enough
He was a false contender
He got so thin there must have been deep sorrow gnawing away at him

What will I do
Will it always be you
I hope and I pray he'll leave me one day

We were so sweet under the Copper Beach
You left a mark you sunk your teeth
Into the back of my neck
Oh let's not pretend I needed the lesson that you taught me well

What will I do
Will it always be you
I hope and I pray he'll leave me one day
What will I do
Must it always be you
I hope and I pray he'll leave me one day
Leave me one day
Leave me one day
Leave me one day
