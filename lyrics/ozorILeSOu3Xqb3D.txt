You sense there's a purpose
Of a higher life
A force in your heart
As if you were revived
Brand new grounds to explore
Before the night arrives

With unlimited options
It has just begun
I've done things that you won't
I wish I'd never done
As I look through the eyes of
What is my design

You're taken the
Ascendancy

Shaking me, saving me
In the darkest hour
Fear was a part of me
Growing stronger
Breaking into my soul
Let me see eternity

A life is a dream
One way directional
It starts with a cell, to something magical
You've been handed the world
A new Identity

Compelling me
You're my relief

Shaking me, saving me
In the darkest hour
Fear was a part of me
Growing stronger
Breaking into my soul
Let me see eternity

Turning me, burning me
In the darkest hour
Fear was part of me
Growing stronger
Breaking into my soul
Bringing me serenity

You're taken the
Ascendancy

Shaking me, saving me
In the darkest hour
Fear was a part of me
Growing stronger
Breaking into my soul
Let me see eternity

Turning me, burning me
In the darkest hour
Fear was part of me
Growing stronger
Breaking into my soul
Bringing me serenity

The day I exhale
