No distinction, no emotion for right or wrong
They tell me any choice will do
No color contrast in their dull morality
The shades of good and bad are through
Situational lies, situational hate
Situational adultery
They mix the black and white so casually
Their ethics sem so vague to me
And I'm black and white in a gray world
Black and white in a gray world
Black and white in a gray world
It's not so easy finding answers in the shade
It takes some patience, takes some grit
But it's better than throwing all you colors
In the street, what's life without color in it?
Ooh, I feel so out of place
Like I've landed on the moon
You can see it in my face
I don't mind being different
'Cause I'm different for the truth
No distinction, no emotion for right or wrong
They tell me any choice will do
No color contrast in their dull morality
The shades of good and bad are through
And I'm black and white in a gray world
Black and white in a gray world
Black and white in a gray world
