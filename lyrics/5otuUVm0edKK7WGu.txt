Hey
I don't think you're there
But it's two am I'm awoke
And scared
I'm alone tonight
I'm alone tonight

Do you still sleep with
That old brown bear
That I won for you
At our first state fair?
I'm alone tonight
Ya, I'm alone tonight

I know some days we all cry
We break down
Ya, we lose our minds
Let it go sometimes
Got to let it go sometimes

I know some days we all cry
We break down
Ya, we lose our minds
Let it go sometimes
Got to let it go sometimes

I see you've given up

I know some days we all cry
We break down
Ya, we lose our minds
I know some days we all cry
But let's trust life
Let's just trust life

No
I know it's fair
That we traveled up and down
Everywhere
But I'm alone tonight
I'm alone tonight

Do you still drive
That old Accord
That broke down on us
And was uninsured?
I'm alone tonight
I'm alone tonight

I know some days we all cry
We break down
Ya we lose our minds
Let it go sometimes
Got to let it go sometimes

I know some days we all cry
We break down
Ya, we lose our minds
Let it go sometimes
Got to let it go sometimes

I see you've given up

I know some days we all cry
We break down
Ya, we lose our minds
I know some days we all cry
But let's trust life
Let's just trust life

In time it all works out
It's nothing to cry about
We always have our doubts
But let's trust life

I know some days we all cry
But let's trust life
Let's just trust life

In time it all works out
It's nothing to cry about
We always have our doubts
But let's trust life
Let's just trust life
