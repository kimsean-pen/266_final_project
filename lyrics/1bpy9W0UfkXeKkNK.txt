Girl I know this might seem strange
But let me know if I'm out of order
For stepping to you this way
See I've been watching you for a while
And I just gotta let you know
That I'm really feeling your style
Plus I had to know your name
And leave you with my number
And I hope that you would call me someday
If you want you can give me yours too
And if you don't well I ain't mad at'cha
We can still be cool 'cause

I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name
And maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill

Damn I'm surprised that you called
'Cause the way you walked away
I thought I wasn't gon see you no more
Since you didn't wanna give me your math
I thought that you were iggin' me
And wasn't diggin' me
But anyway what you doing tonight
I'll probably be with my peeps
If it's cool with you maybe we'll swing by
And you can just chill with us
Or you can just chill with me
As long as you're comfortable
And you feel secure when you're with me cause

I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name
And maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill

Oh, oh, baby yeah
Maybe we can oh
Go and see a movie girl
Or maybe we can hang out girl
Whatever you wanna do
Just let me know
It's up to you

I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name
And maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill

I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name
And maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill
