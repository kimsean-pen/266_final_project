Let's get this straight
You are a panic in the bloodstream yet you bring me peace
You are a stutter in the heart that beats inside of me

You are my last, you are my first
You kill me for the better
You are the rising tide
You're every fucking thing inside me now

You are the violence in my veins
You are the war inside my brain
You are my glitter and my gloom
I am so numb without you

You are the violence in my veins
You are the war inside my brain
You are my glitter and my gloom
I am so numb without you
I am so numb without you

Let's get this straight
You are a fever in the cold yet I'm not shivering
You are a shudder in the voice that screams inside of me

You are my last, you are my first
You kill me for the better
You are the rising tide
You're every fucking thing inside me now

You are the violence in my veins
You are the war inside my brain
You are my glitter and my gloom
I am so numb without you

I won't leave, no I won't surrender
Yeah, I'll wait till the end of, the end of time
You are my glitter and my gloom
I am so numb without you

Without you, without you
I'm numb without you
Without you, without you
I'm numb without you
Without you, without you

You're every fucking thing inside me now

You are the violence in my veins
I am so numb without you

You are the violence in my veins
You are the war inside my brain
You are my glitter and my gloom
I am so numb without you

I won't leave, no I won't surrender
Yeah, I'll wait till the end of, the end of time
You are my glitter and my gloom
I am so numb without you
I am so numb without you
