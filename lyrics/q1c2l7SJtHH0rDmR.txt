Please believe me when I say
There's nothing harder than the strife
When heavy waters try to break you
you will be singing for life

When you feel like your world is falling down
And darkness has taken your sight
There's no need to be carrying a frown
I'll help you sing it out tonight

Sing it away
All my troubles away
Sing it away
Never make me fade away
Sing it away
All my troubles away
Sing it away
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
I'm gonna sing it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Yeeaah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
I'm gonna sing it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
I'm gonna sing it away

So if you're focused, you can make it
You'll feel like nothing can steer you of your course
When fear will try to make you cave in
Remember that love is the source

When you feel like your dreams are beaten down
and your fire is loosing its light
There's no need to be carrying a frown
I'll help you sing it out tonight

Sing it away
All my troubles away
Sing it away
Never make me fade away
Sing it away
All my troubles away
Sing it away
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
I'm gonna sing it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Yeeaah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
I'm gonna sing it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
I'm gonna sing it away

When all of the walls come crashing down
When you try to scream but can't make a sound
Don't' you worry about it, don't you worry about it
You just gotta sing it away

Sing it away
All my troubles away
Sing it away
Never make me fade away
Sing it away
All my troubles away
Sing it away
I'm gonna sing it away
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
I'm gonna sing it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Yeeaah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
I'm gonna sing it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
I'm gonna sing it away
