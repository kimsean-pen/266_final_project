Dark as roses, and fine as sand
I feel your healing and your sting again
I hear you laughing and my soul is saved
On forgotten graves you cry

Crawl like ivy up my spine
Through my nerves and into my eyes
Cuts like anguish or
Recollections of better days gone by

But it's alright
When you're all in pain
And you feel the rain come down
Oh, it's alright
When you find your way
Then you see it disappear
Oh, it's alright
Though your garden's grey
I know all your graces
Someday will flower
Woawoa Woawoa
In a sweet sunshower
In a sweet sunshower

Eyes like oceans so far away
A feather trail to a better way
Worried mornings turn into days
Then into worried nights

But it's alright
When you're all in pain
And you feel the rain come down
Oh, it's alright
When you find your way
Then you see it disappear
It's alright
Though your garden's grey
I know all your graces
Someday will flower
Woawoa Woawoa
Sweet sunshower
Oh, in a sweet sunshower
Oh, in a sweet sunshower
In a sweet, sweet, sweet sunshower
Oh, oh

I know all your graces
Someday will flower
In a sweet
In a sweet sunshower
It's alright
All you'll be you are today, are today
It's alright
All you'll be you are today, are today
Are today
Are today
Are today
Are today
