Waking up
Midnight November
And you're still in my bed
It's kinda rough
Cause since I met ya
There's things we've never said

So if I go
For a little while longer
When I'm home
We can talk about the big falls of the road

If you say go
I would stop everything, oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like its never been broke
Though, my soul

Lately I really need to know
How long, how long can we be touch and go
Oh my soul
How long, how long can we be touch and go

It's not enough
To say I want you
'Cause I'll say anything
I'm holding out
To feel without a doubt
I have just been questioning it

But if I go
For a little while longer
When I'm home
We can talk about the big falls of the road

And if you say go
I would stop everything, oh
My heart would play the role
And act like its never been broke
Though, my soul

Lately I really need to know
How long, how long can we be touch and go
Oh, my soul
How long, how long can we be

All of my bones, they scream "I'm right"
If you're taking me home to stay the night
Darling, my soul would heal

If you say go
I would stop everything, oh
My heart would play the role
And act like it's never been broke
Oh, my soul

Lately I really need to know
How long, how long can we be touch and go
Oh, my soul
How long, how long can we be touch and go
How long, how long can we be touch and go
How long, how long can we be touch and go
