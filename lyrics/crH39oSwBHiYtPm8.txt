My baby caught the train, left me all alone
My baby caught the train, left me all alone
She knows I love her, she doin' me wrong
My baby bought the ticket, long as her right arm
My baby bought the ticket, long as my right arm
She says she's gonna ride, long as I been from home

Well who been talking, everything that I do
Well who been talking, everything that I do
Well you is my baby, I hate to lose

Well good bye baby, hate to see you go
Well good bye baby, hate to see you go
You know I love you, I'm the causin of it all
I'm the causin' of it all
I'm the causin' of it all
I'm the causin' of it all
I'm the causin' of it all
