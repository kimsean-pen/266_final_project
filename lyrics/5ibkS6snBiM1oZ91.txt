Sacred, created
By all the hated
Blinded by the moving tide
Steady as the masses hide

Filtered, shaded
Long since faded
Spirits drowning one by one
Sinking until they're gone
Till they are gone

Pray to the master
Betray or be replaced
The weight of disaster
Lay them all to waste

Desperation
Better be
Setting sail in a stormy sea
Alone against humanity

Dark confusion
Necessity
Written now in history

Paradeigma
Broken stigma

Paradeigma
Broken stigma

Pray to the master
Betray or be replaced
The weight of disaster
Lay them all to waste

Apprehension
Liquid tension
Further than before
Free him from the depth once more
