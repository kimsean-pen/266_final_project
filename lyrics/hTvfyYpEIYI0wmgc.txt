Call my name whenever
Whenever you're lonely and blue
Hit my house whenever
Whenever you need me to call on you

And any time, baby, that you need love
And a little of that understanding too
Feel free, love, to call on me, love
'Cause I'm gonna call on you

I'll be there most any
Most any time of day
Call on me
To see you, baby, in the same old
Loving way
Call on me

And if in the night you call l
And I'm away
Leave a little note, baby, I'll
Be there when you say
Call on me

I'm so lonely, love
When you're away
Call on me
And if I should ever
If I should ever call on you I want you to
Call on me always
I hope your love will always
Be so true
You call on me, babe, and I'm
Sure to call on you
You call on me, babe, and
I'm gonna call on you

Come on, babe
Come on, babe
Come on
Come on, babe
Come on
Come on, babe
Don't you know I'm down on my knees
And I'm begging, baby, please
Call me, call on me, babe...
