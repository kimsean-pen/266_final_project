Sisotowbell Lane
Noah is fixing the pump in the rain
He brings us no shame
We always knew that he always knew

Up over the hill
Jovial neighbours come down when they will, with stories to tell
Sometimes they do
Yes, sometimes we do

We have a rocking chair
Each of us rocks his share
Eating muffin buns and berries by the steamy kitchen window
Sometimes we do, our tongues turn blue

Sisotowbell Lane
Anywhere else now would seem very strange
The seasons are changing everyday in everyway

Sometimes it is spring
Sometimes it is not anything
A poet can sing
Sometimes we try
Yes, we always try

We have a rocking chair
Somedays we rock and stare
At the woodlands and the grasslands
And the badlands 'cross the river
Sometimes we do, we like the view

Sisotowbell Lane
Go to the city, you'll come back again
To wade through the grain
You always do
Yes, we always do

Come back to the stars
Sweet well water and pickling jars
We'll lend you the car
We always do
Yes, sometimes we do

We have a rocking chair
Someone is always there
Rocking rhythms while they're waiting
With the candle in the window
Sometimes we do
We wait for you
