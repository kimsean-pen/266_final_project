I've never felt like I belonged
I've never fit in any place, been alone, until now
Been carryin' a weight that's not my own
This levee's gonna break, and I'm not sure I can hold on

And I'm not sure, how long, I can, hold off this storm
There's a, dark cloud, right overhead

Give it to me
Just give it to me, give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me

I was taught I should stand up and be strong
It turns out it was a truth I could've sent home, until now
I was born with a shotgun in my hand, I'm not afraid of anything, but the dark, without you

I'm not sure, how long, I can, hold off this storm
There's a, dark cloud, right overhead

Give it to me
Just give it to me, give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me

Give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me
Just give it to me, give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me
I'll take it all away, just give it to me
