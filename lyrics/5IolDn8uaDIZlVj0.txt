There's a story of a young man
Who was taken from his home
He missed his sister become a woman
And his father growing old
From the distance he watched his mother
Mourn a loss, all alone
And when he thinks about his brother
He can't seem to find the phone
From the window of his life, he can see his home
As it passes by he feels a pain no one knows
Past every better judgement, he packs his things to run away
Like an ocean, distance is a beast that can't be tamed

He left you behind
He left you behind

Now the young man roams the globe
Searching for the very thing he left at home
He searched far and wide, under every stone
The more he walked the more he was alone
This young man is a lot like me
Except he learned from those mistakes he made
If I don't slow down I might break
I'll be trapped forever in this cage

From the window of my life I can see home
As it passes by I feel a pain no one knows
Past every better judgement, I pack my things to run away
Like an ocean, distance is a beast that can't be tamed

He left you behind
He left you behind
