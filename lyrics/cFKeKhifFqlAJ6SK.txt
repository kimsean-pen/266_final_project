Questioning what to believe in
A barren field of what once was
Left to walk alone into death's embrace

No one to understand the sensation
All is lost yet who would ever know
The release from its grip in reach
A final step towards the true rebirth

Everything must cease to start again
The inevitable in sight, the flickering candle of life
A prophecy told sees truth again
Summon the power to finish the task

Dying hope in a deadland
Fortunes waged in this campaign
Forged by blood but forever lost
The prison cell inside yourself

No one to understand the sensation
All is lost yet who would ever know
The release for its grip in reach
A final step towards the true rebirth

Everything must cease to start again
The inevitable in sight, the flickering candle of life
A prophecy told sees truth again
Summon the power to finish the task
