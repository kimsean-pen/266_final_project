You belong to this time as much as me
The world turns around in an ages old dance
Please tell me why the changes are so deep
As men are now shadows of long gone dreams
Fear lives in the eyes of thousands
As the day becomes night like in a glimpse
Silent voices don't pray anymore
As no one listens out there, now we know
Am I the only one?
I need to know who will stand beside me
There should be some hope
Hidden beyond this dark
Please convince me
There's something pure in this world
I have to know I'm not alone
I need to know who will stand beside me
There should be some hope
Hidden beyond the dark
Please convince me
There's something pure in this world
Please tell me it once more
I have to know that I'm not the only one
The questions remain, a new light's born
The blackbirds return to repeat their old song
It's about time to cross the empty streets
And find a new place to feel at home
The city explodes in a million flashes
I've no further plans, but this sidewalk
Busy people around, come and go
I would give anything to be one of those
