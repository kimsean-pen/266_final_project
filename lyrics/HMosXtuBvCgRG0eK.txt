Speak up - you know what is up
Code of silence?! Who set you up?!
Some shit so wrong in this world
It's all fucked up now you're gone

Speak up - you know what went on
How could you let it go?
It's murder you covered up
Stained blood on your soul

It's your day, it's your day, it's your day, it's your day...

Down on my knees, hands stretched to heaven above
Christ this pain is hard to live with, don't fill my heart with love
Engulf my heart with vengeance, you need to see our pain
Don't fill this heart with love, the truth needs to be told

You can't mask pain - my pain, our pain
You can't mask pain - my pain, our pain
You can't mask pain - my pain, our pain
You can't mask pain - my pain, our pain

How the fuck am I supposed to sit still?
All you motherfuckers out there throwing a rock
Better get at this shit why don't you back off quick?
What's the body on my skin?
You won't find what's wrong, we got it back on
One slept under the covers, that's cause of your life

You can't mask pain - my pain, our pain (our pain)
You can't mask pain - my pain, our pain
You can't mask pain - my pain, our pain (our pain)
You can't mask pain - my pain, our pain

Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you...

Friday I was freaking out...

You can't mask pain - my pain, our pain (our pain)
You can't mask pain - my pain, our pain
You can't mask pain - my pain, our pain (our pain)
You can't mask pain - my pain, our pain

You can't mask pain - my pain, our pain (our pain)
You can't mask pain - my pain, our pain (our pain)
You can't mask pain - my pain, our pain (our pain)
