Wake up, go to work
I was wishing for the past again
It all stopped but my world is
Slowly starting to turn again

So I want outside I stood in the rain
I saw the love and I felt the pain
I am alone but I'm on my way
'Cause I, cause I, I'll be okay
'Cause I, cause I, I'll be okay

And you??? only on
And with my broken heart, I
You, you tried to kill my star
And leave me in the dark

But I am li-like a firefly
Like a firefly
Li-like a firefly
I am a li-like a firefly
Like a firefly
Li-like a firefly

Your bodies would never stop
Like a ghost in a nightmare
But then your lies woke me up
And I'll move on with my fairytale

And I walked outside and I saw the sun
I looked around, I smiled at to mine
Jumped in the cab and I'm on my way
'Cause I, 'cause I, I'll be okay
'Cause I, 'cause I, I'll be okay

And you??? only on
And with my broken heart, I
You, you tried to kill my star
And leave me in the dark

But I am li-like a firefly
Like a firefly
Li-like a firefly
I am a li-like a firefly
Like a firefly
Li-like a firefly

And you??? only on
And with my broken heart, I
You, you tried to kill my star
And leave me in the dark

But I am li-like a firefly
Like a firefly
Li-like a firefly
I am li-like a firefly
Like a firefly
Li-like a firefly
But I am li-like a firefly
Like a firefly
Li-like a firefly
I am li-like a firefly
Like a firefly
Li-like a firefly
