And if I must go and die at 27
Then at least I know I died a legend
Now, will you roll and ride like we're together?
And keep the vibe alive inside forever
And feel me forever
They say I need to slow down, but I don't know how

Yeah
Real feelings from past dealings
When people counted me out 'til I grew up to count millions, uh
Like I guess it's good to be different, huh?
I'm a star so the sky isn't the limit, huh?
I'm living like it's my last day
Smoke as if there's not already 27 roaches in the ashtray
Smile as if no one hated at all
As if anyone understood anytime I evolved
Tell me what do you do when your dreams come true?
Buy a Bentley and look just like you?
How am I supposed to write a song when I'm famous
And all the pain is created?
I need to overdose on inspiration
27

Why don't you just go home?
Well, I can't right now, I'm a rolling stone

And if I must go, and fly away
And kiss my baby girl goodnight
And if this really is goodbye
Then let's set the city on fire
Can you take me higher?
Now, can you take me higher?
Now, can you take me higher?
Can you take me higher?

If I must go, die at 27
Then at least I know I died a legend
Will you roll and ride like we're together?
And keep the vibe alive forever
Keep the vibe alive forever
If I must go, die at 27
Then at least I know I died a legend
Will you roll and ride like we're together?
And keep the vibe alive forever
Keep the vibe alive forever

I let these words seep through my soul
And speak through the song
'Cause if one day, I'm no longer here in the physical
Then at least I give you my voice to listen to
What is a beautiful life without a beautiful death?
What is a beautiful mind, how is our beauty defined?
Is it for you to decide, is it my duty to die?
No matter how I'm remembered, just let me be remembered
Kells
Yeah, forever young, though
Always be those crazy kids running wide-eyed down the boulevard
27, Bloom
