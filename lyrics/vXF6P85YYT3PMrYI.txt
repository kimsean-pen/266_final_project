A circle I can't break
A past I can't escape
No matter what I do
It all comes back to you
Regret that I can't shake
The choices that I make
No matter what I do
It all comes back to you

Tried to find my own way, but no, I can't
I knew you like the back of my hand
Old habits are hard to break
And it's hard to fill that space

I come begging
I come crawling
Right back to your bed
Try not to think but your memory
Always rears its ugly head

A circle I can't break
A past I can't escape
No matter what I do
It all comes back to you
Regret that I can't shake
The choices that I make
No matter what I do
It all comes back to you

Some come, some more go
But you still fill up my skull
Old habits are hard to break
But they don't even come close

Old habits are hard to break
But you still fill up my skull
Old habits are hard to break
But they don't even come, even come close
