Happy and I'm smilin'
Walk a mile to drink your water
You know I'd love to love you

And above you there's no other

We'll go walking out
While others shout
Of war disaster

Oh, we won't give in
Let's go living in the past
Once I used to join in
Every boy and girl was my friend
Now there's revolution
But they don't know
What they're fighting
Let us close our eyes
Outside their lives
Go on much faster
Oh, we won't give in
We'll keep living in the past
Oh, we won't give in
Let's go living in the past
Oh no, no, we won't give in
Let's go living in the past
