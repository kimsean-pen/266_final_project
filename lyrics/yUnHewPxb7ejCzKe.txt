Echoes of angels have cried
To tell me the church and your gates are not mine
Borrowed the tears from their pride
And man who neglects and makes woman a crime

My love
Tell me the sky's not only for you
My love
Break me, I'm not made like you
My god
Save me

Am I a crime? Crime? Crime?
Am I a crime? Crime? Crime?

This criminal heart that I've sown
Is born from the guilt of the limbs I adorn
Feminine breath met with scorn
Cannot bear the weight that impersonates yours

My love
I'd give up my eyes to see like you
My love
Break me, I'm not made like you
My God
Save me

Am I a crime? Crime? Crime?
From a woman's womb
Am I a crime? Crime? Crime?
From a woman's womb
From a woman's womb

If I am the beast from temptation is born
Why can you not see the woman as more?

Am I a crime? Crime? Crime?
From a woman's womb
Am I a crime? Crime? Crime?
From a woman's womb
From a woman's womb

From a woman's womb
From a woman's womb
