Just one look and I fell so hard
in love with you.

I found out how good it feels
to have your love.

Say you will be mine
forever and always.

Just one look and I knew
that you were my only one.

I thought I was dreaming
but I was wrong, yeah yeah yeah.
But I'm gonna keep on scheming
Until I make you, make you my own.

So you see I really care
without you, I'm nothing.

Just one look and I know
I'll get you someday.

Just one look that's all it took,
Just one look that's all it took...
