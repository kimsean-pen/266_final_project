All this time alone
I cannot go home
Artificial friend
You reap what you sow

You said it was a little of something else
I hope that you lose it all
Cause you were the one that made me feel better
In such a fucked up, bitter way
I don't understand what you say

All this time you've known
Such condescending tone
Taste the tears of men
Did it make you feel better then

You said it was a little of something else
I hope that you lose it all
Cause you were the one that made me feel better
In such a fucked up, bitter way
I don't understand what you say
