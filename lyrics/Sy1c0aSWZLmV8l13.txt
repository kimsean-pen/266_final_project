Stirring, shaken, all of us waking
Under the same cover of sky
You said my freedom feels
Like a white lie

Sweet on the backseat
Another day bolder
A love spell rushes you by
The smoke and the smoulder

We were only inches away
Still had a long, long way to go
We were only inches away
Still had a long, long way to go

Weren't we born to break out
To feel the muddy banks swell?
I think of you on the dancefloor
In a stuccoed motel
Forecasting when and where we'd end up
Couldn't save us anyhow
Just kid conversation
My star sign resolver

You only had your olympic girls
The frosted sheen of leotard twirls
Running revolt and winning gold
For the TV screen
Before being led back to the cells

Lay your head in the lap of a girl
You'll never learn something
If it isn't taught well
You'll never find a thing
If you can't lose yourself
Every once in a while

I looked for your figure
The cut your shape would make
In the freedom of a microphone
There's a shadow I can't shake
Who's there?

Who's there in the morning?
To see you at the station
And when you feel like giving up
There, so you can hold her

We were only inches away
Still had a long, long way to go
We're only inches away
Still have a long, long way to go
We were only inches away
Still had a long, long way to go
