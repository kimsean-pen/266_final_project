Now my tender heart had hardened
I'm taking walks in my dead garden
I'm shooting marbles 'cross the floor
In the maintenance closet at the grocery store

In my little black apartment
I found love's secret compartment
And now I keep my things inside
That's my Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

Somewhere back there I started drifting
And I just drifted all away
Now am I still the man you paid for?
Am I something completely different in the night and in the day?

I was hideous and handsome
And I held myself for ransom
Yes I was honest and I lied
That's my Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

And I know that you tried
I was standing on the beautiful downtown skyscraper
I was looking down the side

But beauty's frail and beauty's passing
And she soon goes out of fashion
Then she's just running down the drain
She'll be always stuck somewhere between big joy and big pain

And although she'll always slay me
I will make her be my baby
Yes I will take her as my bride

There's a thousand ways to love her
Open heart and undercover
And I just never could decide
That's my Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
