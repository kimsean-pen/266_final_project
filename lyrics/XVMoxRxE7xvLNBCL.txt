She
She's my wild one
(Wild one)
My heart is in panic
Her eyes look so manic now

She
Little wild one
(Wild one)
My heart is a chaser
She's strung out on razors now

She gave up on Jesus for living on Venus
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I'm drinking the Kool-Aid
I jumped on the grenade
Know that my mind's gonna blow, hello

She
She's my wild one
(Wild one)
My heart is in danger
From shadows and strangers now

She
Little wild one
(Wild one)
She's covered in angels
And demons and halos now

She gave up on Jesus for living on Venus
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I'm drinking the Kool-Aid
I jumped on a grenade
All of my mind's gonna blow, hello

(Wild one)

(Wild one)

She gave up on Jesus for living on Venus
All fucked up with nowhere to go
I'm drinking the Kool-Aid
I jumped on a grenade
All of my mind's gonna blow, hello
Little wild one
(Wild one)
My heart is in danger
She's strung out on razors now
My heart is in danger
She's strung out on razors now
