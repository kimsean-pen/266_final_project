How can you love something
And know you're not trying
It feels like a waste of space
Im all through with lying
And the love we feel
Is fueled by nothing
Oh this feeling
Are we breathing still
How can you love something
And know that you're dying
It feels like a waste of space
And I'm though with trying
And the love we feel is fueled by nothing
Oh these feelings
Are we breathing still
Make it stop
Its all nothing
Its all nothing
Make it stop
Its all nothing
Its all nothing
How can you love something
And know you're not trying
It feels like a waste of space
Im all through with lying
And the love we feel
Is fueled by nothing
Oh this feeling
Are we breathing still
Make it stop
Its all nothing
Make it stop
