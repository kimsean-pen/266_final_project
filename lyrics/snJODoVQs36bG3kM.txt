Into the roar
Ignite the day's addiction
The soporific war
To numb my true attrition
It's my declaration
The altar spinning on the floor
My fight â€“ my darkest white
The only war you will adore

I'll forever be
Head of theocracy
All the same with a different name
I am your escape
I'm your enemy
Your long lostfriend
Just taste the bile to reconcile
The moment you enter your end
The darkest white

Into the core
The untilled fields of fission
I've come to still your thirst
Your hunger for submission
It's my defamation
Acidic silence makes you sore
You'll long for one more song
In every line you'll ask for more

I'll forever be
Head of theocracy
All the same with a different name
I am your escape
I'm your enemy
Your long lost friend
Just taste the bile to reconcile
The moment you enter your end
The darkest white

I'll forever be
Head of theocracy
All the same with a different name
I am your escape
I'm your enemy
Your long lost friend
Just taste the bile to reconcile
Blinded by light
The darkest white
