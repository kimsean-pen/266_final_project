Question number three is: who'll go out and dine with me?
Question number four: will there be more?

Question number five: when I arrive?
Question number six: will she be fixed?
Question number seven is: will she let me still her kiss?
Question number eight: is it a date?

Question number nine: after we dine?
Question number ten: let's dance again
Question number eleven came when she wisper'd sweet my name
Question number twelve were about ourselves

The question number thirteen...
The question number thirteen...
