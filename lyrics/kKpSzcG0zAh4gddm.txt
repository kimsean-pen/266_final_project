Fucked up, anxious
Full of fear
How, how did I get here?

Well I don't know
Pull the sheets over my eyes again
Unwind this time of night
It's wicked, but it's warm
And it doesn't feel right

Waiting for nothing
These feelings come and go
How, how do I get out of here?

Well I don't know
Pull the sheets over my eyes again
Unwind this time of night
It's wicked, but it's warm
And it doesn't feel right

Pull the sheets over my eyes
Pull the sheets over my eyes
Pull the sheets over my eyes
Pull the sheets over my eyes
