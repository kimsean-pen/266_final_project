Hearts break too fast
When they're sentimental
Won't stay, won't last
When it's love at first sight
So why are my convictions
Blinded by your spotlight

Can't breathe, can't sleep
Need some medication
I'll kiss goodbye to my reservations
I know there's other fish out in the sea
Not for me, I want you
If I can't have you

Then I don't want anyone
(I don't want anyone)
If I can't have you
Then all the damage has been done, baby
We can break these rules
If you wanna have some fun
(If you wanna have some fun)
Think of all the love that you would lose
If I can't have you (If I can't have you)
If I can't have you (If I can't have you)
Heartbeat, cold sweat
Thoughts slippin' under

Can't fight, no threat
'Cause there's just no use
One look, no hesitation
I'm slippin' into you
Forgive these eyes
These lips are chasin'

No time to waste on an invitation
My shame, my self control
Has suffered enough
And everybody wants to be loved
If I can't have you
Then I don't want anyone

(I don't want anyone)
If I can't have you
Then all the damage has been done, baby
We can break these rules
If you wanna have some fun
(If you wanna have some fun)
Think of all the love that you would lose
If I can't have you (If I can't have you)
If I can't have you (If I can't have you)
I haven't seen the best that love has had to offer
They say perfection's always right around the corner
Could be true

But if I can't have you
If I can't have you
Then I don't want anyone

(I don't want anyone)

If I can't have you
Then all the damage has been done, baby
We can break these rules
If you wanna have some fun
(If you wanna have some fun)
Think of all the love that you would lose
If I can't have you (If I can't have you)
If I can't have you (If I can't have you)
(If I can't have you)
Think of all the love that you would lose
If I can't have you
