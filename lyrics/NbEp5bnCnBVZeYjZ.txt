Show yourself
Show yourself
I wanna see everything you're made of

Tear it down
Rip it out
Shed your skin and float it down the river

Lose yourself
Lose yourself
Wild horses ride you through the valley

Come alive
Come alive
Sail into the void without any worries

You are not as safe as far as I can tell
And I can tell
Only you can save yourself
Soon this will all be a distant memory
or could this dream
be real at all

Stars align
Stars Align
Stars will fall and get you into trouble

Be afraid
Don't be afraid
Speak the ancient wisdom of the desert

You are not as safe as far as I can tell
And I can tell
Only you can save yourself
Soon this will all be a distant memory
Or could this dream
be real at all

Show yourself
Show yourself
I wanna see everything you're made of

Reveal yourself
Reveal yourself
The truth will a send a ripple through your body

See your fate
You'll see your fate
Death will come and still you from the living

Dead and gone
Dead and gone
I'll see you on the other side of fire
