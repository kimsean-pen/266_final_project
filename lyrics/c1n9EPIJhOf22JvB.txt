Even if I were king for a day I'd leave this place behind
Could have everything that money could buy, but not be satisfied
Yeah there must be more that I'm looking for

Cause there's gotta be something out there
If I fly high enough I'll find it somewhere
So I'll hold my breath till I float away
Maybe I'll come down someday

Even if I was somebody else, I'd chase the same song
Could be near far or be on the stars I'll find where I belong
If I don't let go I may never know

Cause there's gotta be something out there
If I fly high enough I'll find it somewhere
So I'll hold my breath till I float away
Maybe I'll come down someday

Cause there's gotta be something out there
If I fly high enough I'll find it somewhere
So I'll hold my breath till I float away
Maybe I'll come down someday

I may never find the answer, I just gotta be on my own
This may not last forever
I know I can always come home

Yeah, there's gotta be something out there
If I fly high enough I'll find it somewhere
So I'll hold my breath till I float away
Maybe I'll come down someday

Yeah, there's gotta be something out there
If I fly high enough I'll find it somewhere
So I'll hold my breath till I float away
Maybe I'll come down someday
Maybe I'll come down someday
Maybe I'll come down someday
