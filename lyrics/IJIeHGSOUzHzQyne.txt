I'm a god of mine
You can't be my necessary
And look up this sky
I'm the one
It's all about me
There's so many so many doors
It look like a shit but I go
I will find it
Oh I will find it
My mind is not for you
My life is not for you
I can't lie
You're like a trash
Don't you get it
Get it Get it now
My mind is not for you
My life is not for you
I can't lie
You're like a trash
Don't you get it
Get it Get it now
Get it get it get it get it
Get it get it get it now
Get it get it get it get it
Get
You can't do it like me
You can't do it like me
You can't do it like me
I'm a part of mine
You will never know this feeling
And look up this girl
I'm the one
It's all about me
There's so many so many wars
It look like a shit but I grow
I will find me
Oh I will find me
My mind is not for you
My life is not for you
I can't lie
You're like a trash
Don't you get it
Get it Get it now
My mind is not for you
My life is not for you
I can't lie
You're like a trash
Don't you get it
Get it Get it now
Get it get it get it get it
Get it get it get it now
Get it get it get it get it
Get
You can't do it like me
You can't do it
You can't do it like me
You can't do it like me
You can't do it like me
You can't do it like me
