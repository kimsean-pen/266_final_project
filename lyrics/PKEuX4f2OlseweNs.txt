Ow. (Uh uh uh) uh huh ya ya
(Uh uh uh) I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius
You drive me up the wall
You're a regular original know-it-all
Ooh ooh, you think you're special
Ooh ooh, you think you're somethin' else

Okay, so you're a rocket scientist
That don't impress me much
(Uh uh uh) so you got the brains, but have you got the touch
Now don't get me wrong, ya I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much - (uh uh uh) uh huh ya ya

Uh uh uh I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve - just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair otta lock it
'Cause Heaven forbid it should fall out of place

Ooh ooh, you think you're special
Ooh ooh, you think you're somethin' else
Okay, so you're Brad Pitt
That don't impress me much

So you got the looks, but have you got the touch
Now don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much - oow yaa

You're one of those guys that likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
Now c'mon, baby, tell me - you must be jokin' right!
Ooh ooh, you think you're somethin' special
Ooh ooh, you think you're somethin' else

Okay, so you've got a car
That don't impress me much
So you got the moves, but have you got the touch
Now don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night

That don't impress me much
Uh huh now you think you're cool but have you got the touch
Now now don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night

That don't impress me much - (uh uh, uh) un huh ya ya
Uh uh uh uh, okay, (uh uh) so what do you think, you're Elvis or something?
