Like a prophet of doom
I have come to show you the way
I'm the devil you keep inside
Cause it's all I can do
To stay silent and remain
Watching all of your
Days pass you by

But the time has come
To put your halo down
We may never live forever
So you better live for now
Don't deny it
What you need
Ain't in the clouds
Here it comes
Here it comes
Time to dirty up your halo

Could be living so high
But you waste your life away
So afraid to be what you are
Still I beg you to try and
Start living for today
Cause regret's gonna
Bury your heart

But the time has come
To put your halo down
We may never live forever
So you better live for now
Don't deny it
What you need
Ain't in the clouds
Here it comes
Here it comes
Time to dirty up your halo

You will not obey
You will not obey
Defy it
I will lead the way
I will lead the way
To burn you down

-Solo-

But the time has come
To put your halo down
We may never live forever
So you better live for now
Don't deny it
What you need in the
Here it comes
Here it comes
Time to dirty up your halo

Put down your halo
Put down your halo
Here it comes
Here it comes
Time to dirty up your halo
