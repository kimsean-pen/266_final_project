To fall downward and rust
You built this house with your hands
And your time and your blood
We built this up in one day
To fall downward and rust

I don't move unless you know
Someone you can move
I bruise just like anyone would bruise
And I know we've got a long way to go
I know I've got so far

We built this house with our hands
And our time and our blood
You build this up in one day
To fall downward and rust

You built this house with your hands
And your time and your blood
We built this up in one day
To fall downward and rust

I'm gone, you tried to emphasize
And side with both your ghosts
In time I swore I'd take the straight and narrow path
But the still won't

And I hold his ear
I'm only trying to do my job tonight
Kiss him on top his lips and crucify the fire

We built this house with our hands
And our time and our blood
You built this up in one day
To fall downward and rust

You built this house with your hands
And your time and your blood
We built this up in one day
To fall downward and

Never really feel the same
No, it's never gonna be the same
No, it's never gonna be the same
No, it's never gonna be the same

We built this house with our hands
And our time and our blood
We built this up in one day
To fall downward and rust

We built this house with our hands
And our time and our blood
You built this up in one day
To fall downward and rust

Trust in me the same way
With your time, with your blood
Holy or inane to fall downward and

Never really feel the same
No, it's never gonna be the same
No, it's never gonna be the same
Never gonna be the same

Never really feel the same
Never gonna be the same
Never gonna be the same
Never gonna be the same
