Black and gold
A safe combination
Heaviness sets the seed
For the next generation
You say we're so alike
Well, I wouldn't want to live on the difference
No, I wouldn't want to live on the difference

Sitting down
At 10, 00 feet
Nothing's artificial
It shouldn't be a word
I live on my dreams
Well, I'd never do anything to make them happen
No, I'd never do anything to make them happen

Suddenly, I'm forced to think
And make the right decision
I'm on the brink
You've put me in a position
I'll tell you what
I'll give you me
If you leave the others alone

Canvas cracks
Face unrecognisable
Eyes, have a stony gaze
Moving's not advisable
I know who you are
So, I don't feel the need to make conversation
No, I don't feel the need to make conversation

Suddenly, I'm forced to think
And make the right decision
I'm on the brink
You've put me in a position
I'll tell you what
I'll give you me
If you leave the others alone
Leave the others alone

I'll give you me
