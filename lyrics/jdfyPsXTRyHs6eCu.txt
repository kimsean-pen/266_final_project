Aahh
Aahh
Aahh, ah

I will live forever
If you always keep me in your mind
And it doesn't matter
How far I am
If I ever leave you
I'm gonna be there by your side
If you ever need me
Well, here I am

I'm gonna live forever
Don't you ever forget
And all the stars in heaven
Will shine for me
I'm gonna live forever
No never forget
And noone's lost in heaven's
Eternity

Hold the fire burnin'
Love was never ment to be the end
There's no way to turn it
By accident
I don't need to prove it
I'm just ready for another step
Though my heart is movin'
My soul is near

I'm gonna live forever
Don't you ever forget
And all the stars in heaven
Will shine for me
I'm gonna live forever
No never forget
And noone's lost in heaven's
Eternity

In heaven go higher

I'm gonna live forever
Don't you ever forget
And all the stars in heaven
Will shine for me
I'm gonna live forever
No never forget
And noone's lost in heaven's
Eternity

Aahh
Aahh
Aahh, ah

I'm gonna live forever
No never forget
And noone's lost in heaven's
Eternity
