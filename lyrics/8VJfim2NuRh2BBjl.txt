Damned eye see
Reading about how it's all falling apart
Am I yours to own
Feed me a biscuit and I will fetch you a bone
When we're out of full
With nothing left to loose

They say it's a matter of fact
But I'm not naive enough
To take it as a matter fact
Is everything they needed
Sure you've been having fun
At my expense
Time is a loaded gun and I'm on the fence
Warme it up enough forme
And I'll be your tool
Pay me like a pedigree
And I'll be your fool

Kill your friend
Sadly I find I'm still alive at the end
Did you taste their pain
Spare me the crime untill it's time to pretend
Feeling out of sorts
You pushed me over board

They say it's a matter of fact
But I'm not naive enough
To take it as a matter fact
Is everything they needed
Sure you've been having fun
At my expense
Time is a loaded gun and I'm on the fence
Warme it up enough forme
And I'll be your tool
Pay me like a pedigree
And I'll be your fool
