Björk
I close the door,
Shouldn't burn yet,
The wires get hotter
Palms are glowing.

Björk
This is hot meat metallic blood,
This is hot meat, this is open sweat.

Björk
Show you with my fingers,
Draw with the eye,
With your own breath,
I tear your lungs

Björk
Here is hot meat, this is metallic blood,
This is hot meat, this is open sweat.

Einar
Out this side of the blackest meadows
I make my winter dwelling and crush my bones.

Björk
This is hot meat, this is metallic blood,
This is hot meat,

Björk
I'll sail out the window
I'll walk down the henge
I will not finish
Till I'm fully satisfied.

Björk
This is hot meat, this is metallic blood,
This is hot meat, this is open sweat.
