Can we go back?
Can we go back?
Can we go back?

I will keep you here
I will keep you long
I will keep you here

Can you stay tomorrow?
You won't leave tomorrow
I don't know where it all went wrong

And I will keep you here
And I will keep you long
And I will keep you here

You always say you won
You always say you won
You always say you won

Can you stay tomorrow?
You won't leave tomorrow
I don't know where it all went wrong

So live with me alone
Stay with me alone
And wait with me alone
And stay with me alone

Can we go back?
Can we go back?
Can we go back?

Can you stay tomorrow?
You won't leave tomorrow
I don't know where it all went wrong

And I don't know where it all went wrong
And I don't know where it all went wrong
And I don't know where it all went wrong
And I don't know where it all went wrong
