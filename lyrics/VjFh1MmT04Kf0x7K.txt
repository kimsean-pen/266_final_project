What is she covering up?
What is she lying about?
She's hesitating...
And she's using slow words, I know
But she's moving fast.
Why is this happening now,
Why does this happen to me - all the time?
Don't give up on me
(Love)
And I won't give up on you.
(Love)

Squeeze me, 'til I can't breathe.
And lets just lie here,
In oblivion.
I can't believe in one of us,
I can't know - how long
This love will last.

Stay up in bed with me,
Stay up and play with me,
All day long.
Don't give up on me,
(Love)
And I won't give up on you.
(Love)
I get to wait for the baby
(Love me girl)

Nothing is wrong, what are you scared of?

Squeeze me, 'til I can't breathe.
And lets just lie here,
In oblivion.
I can't believe in one of us,
I can't know - how long
This love will last.

Stay up in bed with me,
Stay up and play with me,
All day long.
Don't give up on me
(Love)
And I won't give up on you
(Love)
I get to wait for the baby
(Love me girl)

Love me girl.
