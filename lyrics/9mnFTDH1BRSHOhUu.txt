So tonight I'm sleeping under the stars
'Cause I feel it
And you're climbing up with me

Your absence used to rip me apart
When I close my eyes
You're still climbing up with me

Tonight, I'm sleeping under the stars
'Cause I feel it
And you're climbing up with me

Your absence used to rip me apart
When I close my eyes
You're climbing up with me
In my memory
