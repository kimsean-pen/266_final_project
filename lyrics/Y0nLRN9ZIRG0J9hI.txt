I have forgotten what it feels like
I don't remember it's true
It will take all I have left to make this right
But I'd like to try it with you

I'm the loneliest I've ever been tonight
I'm the loneliest I've ever been, that's right
I'm the loneliest I've ever been tonight
I'm the loneliest I've ever been tonight

I have forgotten what it tastes like
I don't remember, do you?
Oh, it'll take all I have left to work this out
Oh, push on 'til I'm breaking through

Oh, I'm the loneliest I've ever been tonight
I'm the loneliest I've ever been tonight
I'm inspired by your proposition, but I don't trust my intuition
I'm the loneliest I've ever been tonight

Yours is the curtain that I'd like to pull back
But I can't be certain that you're really real
Yours is the curtain that I'd like to pull back
But I can't be certain that you're really real

Real, real, real
Are you really, really real?
I'm the loneliest I've ever been tonight
I'm the loneliest I've ever been, that's right
I'm inspired by your proposition but I don't trust my intuition
I'm inspired by your proposition but I don't trust my intuition
So I guess I'm going digital tonight
