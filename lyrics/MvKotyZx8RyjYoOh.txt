Outside there's children laughing
The radio plays my favorite song
The sun is shinning

Oh, and peace broke out in the world
And no one says a cruel word
And peace is the sweetest sound I've ever heard

And baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming home

She was just sleeping somewhere
Now she's come back to hold my hand
And we go walking

And the years have all melted away
Yeah, I remember you like yesterday
And the summer's here, so say goodbye to rain

And baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming home

I feel like I am surely dreaming
How can things, oh, so quickly change?
Well, it's strange but true I'm telling you truthfully see

That baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming home

Oh, baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming back to me
My baby's coming home
