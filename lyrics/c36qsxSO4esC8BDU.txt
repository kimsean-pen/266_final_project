One more little one
I'll go down
And stay down
And sleep the rest of the day

Dream new music
To calm down
And stay down
And keep evil away

I can hear you asleep
Changing your shape
Dissolved in some dream

As a new one appears
To take you along
Where you've never been

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Moonlight tonight

Seems to belong to me 'cause I
Even though soon can sleep
I need some company

One hit wouldn't hurt a bit
I'll slow down and sleep
The rest of the time

If it's good shit
You won't know
And I won't know
The fact that I'm dying

If I seem to be reckless with myself
It's the fault of no one

All things have a place
Under the moon
As well as the sun

One more little one I love you
