Four voices perfectly blending
Right from the start
Ooh, I'm afraid that's ending
And my world is fallin' apart

It's over and I feel so alone
This is a sadness I've never known
How did I let the sweetest of dreams slip away?
And I'm afraid the hurt is here to stay

Promises made, not meant to be broken
From a long time ago
Ooh, so many words still unspoken
Tell me how was I to know?

It's over, never thought it would be
Why in the world did this happen to me
How could I let the sweetest of dreams slip away?
And I'm afraid the hurt is here to stay

I go round and round and round in my head
Wanting to take back whatever I said
No one was right, we all made mistakes
I'm ready to do whatever it takes, please

Don't let it be over
No, this is not how it ends
I need my sisters, my family, my friends
Don't wanna let the sweetest of dreams slip away

'Cause if it's over then the hurt is here to stay
Don't let it be over
Please, don't let it be over
Please, don't let it be over
