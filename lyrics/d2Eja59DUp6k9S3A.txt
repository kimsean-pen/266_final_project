This is the end, my time is over
My eyes darken, my hands feel colder
Here, right at the edge of the fall

A frail dim light, growing brighter and brighter
Here, right at the end of the world

I can see the lights are growing brighter in the distance
When I close my eyes, I feel the warmth of a thousand suns

You were my light, my one true love
It broke my heart to leave you behind

I can see the lights are growing brighter in the distance
When I close my eyes, I feel the warmth of a thousand suns

I can see the lights are growing brighter in the distance
When I close my eyes, I feel the warmth of a thousand suns
