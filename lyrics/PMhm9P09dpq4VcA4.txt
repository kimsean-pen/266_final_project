Baby, know that we don't gotta fight tonight
I promise in the morning everything will be alright, yeah
[?] no love or dirty laundry out to dry
I promise in the morning everything will be just fine

Call me, it's always 3AM when you call me
When you know that I don't wanna be lonely
And I could use a hit of your crazy, yeah
Love me, I hate the way you know where to love me
You know that you're the one and the only
One I want to wake up with

Oh, you make me go insane, but that's how I want it
Oh, with every word you say you keep me falling
I'm addicted to, the high I get with you
And I can't stop won't let go
Oh, you make me go insane, but that's how I want it

Baby, know that I don't wanna compromise
I promise in the morning everything will be alright, yeah
I swear I told you half a hundred times that I
I wouldn't ride away if I ain't got you by my side

Call me, it's always 3AM when you call me
When you know that I don't wanna be lonely
And I could use a hit of your crazy, yeah
Love me, I hate the way you know where to love me
You know that you're the one and the only
One I want to wake up with

Oh, you make me go insane, but that's how I want it
Oh, with every word you say you keep me falling
I'm addicted to, the high I get with you
And I can't stop won't let go
Oh, you make me go insane, but that's how I want it

You got me so high
Baby, only you could
You set me on fire and it hurts so good
Never wanna stand back where I stood
You set me on fire and it hurts so good

We don't gotta fight tonight
I promise in the morning everything will be alright, yeah

Oh, you make me go insane, but that's how I want it
Oh, with every word you say you keep me falling
I'm addicted to, the high I get with you
And I can't stop won't let go
Oh, you make me go insane, but that's how I want it
