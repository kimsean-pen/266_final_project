All the times that you called me up
Wishing you would be mine in the morning
I cannot move it on from you
I've been foreign, I've been turning

Into blue vapor
Into blue vapor

All the times that you called me up
Wishing I would be yours when the night falls
You cannot move it on from me
The time, the time
The time crawls

Into blue vapor and bone
Turn to dirt and I will change to stone

Into blue vapor
Blue vapor

Doesn't matter what you say
It's all and I'm turning
Doesn't matter what you say
I'm turning
Into blue vapor and bone

Blue vapor
Blue vapor
Blue vapor
Blue vapor
Blue vapor
Blue vapor
Blue vapor
Blue vapor
Blue vapor
Blue vapor
And bone
And bone
