Right now
Let me take you by the hand
Right now
Put your lips at my command
Right now
Fly me off to lovers lane
Baby
Don't you leave me at the post
Kiss me
You can feel it coast to coast
Right now
Where they need your love the most

You have set my soul on fire
Only you can satisfy this burning desire

Right now
Let the fool world break in two
Right now
Stars can stumble from the blue
Right now
Just as long as I'm with you

Uh huh
Uh huh
Uh huh
Uh huh

Right now
It's the time and it's the place
Right now
For a ride to outer space
Right now
Let me have that while you grace

You have set my soul on fire
Only you can satisfy this burning desire

One time
Let the wine of love flow free
One time
Be the lover you can be
Right now
Come on and give yourself to me

Uh huh
Uh huh
Uh huh

Boo, boo boo...
