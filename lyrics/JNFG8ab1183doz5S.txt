I wanted to write you in all of my songs
I always end up where I start
My empty pages
And if I could paint you like one of my French girls
Would we make love inside your car
Like crashing waves
Like neon lights we burn all night
Hidden colors
In the dark
She's perfect
Undoubtedly worth it
A rising sun at daybreak feels worthless
Self doubt in her mirror now
But doesn't reflect how
She's perfect
On more than the surface
Your fire burns bright
You are my light
One scroll through your gram
To make you feel bad
Evaluating who you are
Or who you aren't

The fact that you blessed us

The moment you woke up
Wish I could hang you up like art

Like Van Gogh's stars
Like neon lights we burn all night
Hidden colors
In the dark
She's perfect
Undoubtedly worth it
A rising sun at daybreak feels worthless
Self doubt in her mirror now
But doesn't reflect how
She's perfect
On more than the surface
Made to believe in silicone dreams
Don't have the looks of a fantasy
You'll never add up to anything
If you ask me what beautiful means
It's the power of a strong woman
Chasing her own dream
I need to make this clear
She's perfect
Undoubtedly worth it
A rising sun at daybreak feels worthless
Self doubt in her mirror now
But doesn't reflect how
She's perfect
On more than the surface
Your fire burns bright
You are my light
I wanted to write you in all of my songs
But there aren't enough words to describe
The fact that you blessed us the moment you woke up
I wish I could hang you up like...
