The skies you climb that once were mine
I'll meet you here back where ashes lie
I'll pray you down to earth someday
I need you here and I can't escape
When you sing I cut myself
I gotta start with something else
Keep my prayers for a rainy day
Basking in the glow free from time constraints
You're the ghost hiding from the sun
You can slip away 'cos my mind is gone
