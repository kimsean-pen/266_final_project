Rising up from a day of plunder
The ale of yesterday has gone down under
The battlefield awaits my soul to Odin
Thor guide me through my battles
Lead me home (to Asgard)
The victorious will rise to the glory of the gods

Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
For the blood is running still
From the roots of Yggdrasil

Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
Carry me to the hill
To the top of Yggdrasil

In the hour of final judgement
Oh father lead my way
When the fire of war reign
I will watch my brothers fall
Our names will be long forgotten
We live on forever
The victorious will rise to the glory of the gods

Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
For the blood is running still
From the roots of Yggdrasil

Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
Carry me to the hill
To the top of Yggdrasil

(solo)

In the dust I swore my hatred
From seeing unborn children die
The mothers weaping wakes my sword for vengeance
I ride into infinity
And as I fall I rise
The victorious will rise to the
glory of the gods (rise, rise, rise, rise)

Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
For the blood is running still
From the roots of Yggdrasil

Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
Carry me to the hill
To the top of Yggdrasil

To the top of Yggdrasil
