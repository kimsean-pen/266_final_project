Morning sun
Shines its light
Blinding the truth
Destroying what's right
Holes begin to pierce the sky
Light that falls
The gathering of lies

Deceive destroys and overgrows
As all becomes
Trampled down below
Trampled down below
In time you will know

Rule and control
For all that it's worth
Worship and serve
Heaven and earth

Holes begin to pierce the sky
Light that falls
The gathering of lies

Deceive destroys and overgrows
As all becomes
Trampled down below
Trampled down below
In time you will know

Holes begin to pierce the sky
Light that falls
The gathering of lies

Deceive destroys and overgrows
As all becomes
Trampled down below
Trampled down below
In time you will know
