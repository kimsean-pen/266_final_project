We were just kids just living in wide-eyed, innocence
Minivan floor like a tenement
We were just kids who believed in
More than just dreams in
More than just justified
Ends to a means

With the sky wide-open
Like a child, eyes-open
Like a child, unbroken
By the wheels gone by
We know

Who we are
(In the fever of our youth)
Who we are
(We've got nothing left to lose)
Who we are
(There's still time enough to choose)
Who we are
Who we are
Who we are

We were just kids
Just limited, misfit, itinerant
Outcasts singing about the dissonance

We were just kids, wide-open
Like a child, eyes-open
Like a child, unbroken
By the wheels gone by
We know

Who we are
(In the fever of our youth)
Who we are
(We've got nothing left to lose)
Who we are
(There's still time enough to choose)
Who we are
Who we are
Who we are
Who we are

They said it's complicated
They said we'd never make it this far
But we are

They said the fight would break us
But the struggle helped to make
Who we are
Who we are
Who we are

Who we are
(In the fever of our youth)
Who we are
(We've got nothing left to lose)
Who we are
(There's still time enough to choose)
Who we are
Who we are

Who we are
(I wanted something with meaning)
Who we are
(Yeah, I wanted something to believe in)
Who we are
(Yeah, sure as I'm here breathing)
Who we are
(I wanted more)
Who we are
(Yeah, I wanted more)
Who we are
(Yeah, I wanted more than just a feeling)
Who we are
(Yeah, for more than just a season)
Who we are
(Yeah, we become what we believe in)
Who we are
Who we are
