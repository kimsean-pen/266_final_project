Open the slits
In your face
And start your day
You don't have much time
To make your slits
Look just right

I'm in your mind
I'm singing
I'm in your mind
I'm singing
La-da, la-da, la-da, la-da
La-da, la-da, da

Look in the mirror
And ask yourself
If you're alright
Put out the glitter
That your soul
Hides behind

You're in my mind
I'm singing
You're in my mind
I'm singing
La-da, la-da, la-da, la-da
La-da, la-da, da

Nowhere were they holy
Open up your eyes and see
The clouds above will hold you
The clouds above will sing

Ah, ah
Ah, ah

And in your mind
You're singing
La-da, la-da, la-da, la-da
La-da, la-da, da
