Don't you want to see the blood?
You've never seen the rain
Your crown
Your fall
I'm still alive
I see the fire
Something is mine
Always
Something inside
You're living always
A Shade
A Saviour
A Way
Feel it
In every desire
Higher and higher
The pain is lifting me from the inside
Feel it
In every desire
Higher and higher
The pain is lifting me from the inside

Though you've forgotten my wrongs
To never feed the rain
Locked away in ignorance
I heard you cry again
I'm still alive
I see the fire
I will give it everything and more
I'm still alive

I see the fire

I've never hated myself like that
Something inside
You're living always
A Shade
A Saviour
A Way
Feel it
In every desire
Higher and higher
The pain is lifting me from the inside
Feel it
In every desire
Higher and higher
The pain is lifting me from the inside
