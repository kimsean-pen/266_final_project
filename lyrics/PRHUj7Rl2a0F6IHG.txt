Longer than
There've been fishes in the ocean
Higher than
Any bird ever flew
Longer than
There've been stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you

Stronger than
Any mountain cathedral
Truer than
Any tree ever grew
Deeper than
Any forest primeval
I am in love with you

I'll bring
Fire in the winters
You'll send
Showers in the springs
We'll fly
Through the falls and summers
With love
On our wings

Through the years
As the fire starts to mellow
Burning lines
In the book of our lives
Though the binding cracks
And the pages start to yellow
I'll be in love with you
I'll be in love with you

Longer than
There've been fishes in the ocean
Higher than
Any bird ever flew
Longer than
There've been stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you
I am in love with you
