Mr ten dollar man
Let me tell where you're bound
Drink your green liquor, lord
You'll roll to the ground
But you come around here
With your money in your hand
Taste of my woman
Well, you die where you stand

Snake mountain blues
They got me down low
I could die in the morning
But no one would know
When my woman come around
My body she'd find
Go down to dundee
Have her a time

Snake mountain's gonna crumble, lord
And fall from the sky
Before that woman of mine
Stops tellin' her lies
If I'd die, lord, she'd weep
She'd weep and she'd mourn
Soon as I is buried
Forget I'd been born

Love a blackskin woman
She won't do you no wrong
Slow to start moaning
She don't moan for long
Oh yellow headed woman
Brings nothing but pain
Takes all you give her
Well she leaves only shame

Oh my daddy, lord, he rides
On a long holy train
First winds of winter
I'll see him again
And it's farewell to this
Yellow headed misery I've known
Snake mountain's calling
Calling me home

Well the Snake mountain blues
Got me down low
I could die in the morning
Ain't no one would know
Aw my woman come around
My body she'd find
Go down to dundee
Have her a time
