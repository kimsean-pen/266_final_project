Anda my love
Wake up to your window
The day calls in billows
It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart
In cosy red rainbow
It's shaking off halos
And the memory of our sacred so and so's

Oh, take my hand sweet
Complete your release and bury your feet
And married we'll be
Alone in receiving ours is a feeling
Not that they would see
They don't know that we could be
That way your cradle escaped the sea
And your raven-haired mama (cocked twenty so / caught told you so's)?

We're laying in the shadow of your family tree
Your haunted heart and me
Brought down by an old idea whose time has come
And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree
There's a hundred hearts soar free
Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep it young

I'll be your mind
Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently
Call me on time
And we'll go over to nana's place disgracefully
Fall into line
There's a garden grave and a place they've saved for you
I'll fall by your side
Though your silver-haired mama throws (twenty so / told you so's)?

We're laying in the shadow of your family tree
Your haunted heart and me
Brought down by an old idea whose time has come
And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree
There's a hundred hearts soar free
Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep it young

And now we're gathered in the shadow of your family tree
In haunted harmony
Brought down by an old idea whose time has come
And in the shadow of the valley of your family tree
There's a hundred hearts soar free
Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep us young
