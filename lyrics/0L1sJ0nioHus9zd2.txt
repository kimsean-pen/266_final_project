Who keeps you runnin'
Who steals your lovin'
Who keeps you comin'
I want to know, boy

Who shakes your tree now
Give you everything you need now
Oh mercy me now
Give me a reason

I never knew loneliness
Been lost ever since you left
Try to find a way to forget

I'll never see stars again
I'll never be the one for him
[?] with my own two hands

Am I losing you
Is this where the story ends
Am I losing you
Am I on my own again

You haunt my dreams now
You always taunted me now
Say you wanted me now
Lock me up and toss the keys out

You say you love me
Can't get enough of me
You always runnin'
Leave me with nothin'
I never knew loneliness
Been lost ever since you left
Try to find a way to forget
I'll never see stars again
I'll never be the one for him
[?] with my own two hands
Am I losing you
Is this where the story ends
Am I losing you
Am I on my own again
Am I losing you
Is this where the story ends
Am I losing you
Am I on my own again
