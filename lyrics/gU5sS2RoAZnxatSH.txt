Ayy, where all of my City Girls at?
North Miami, where it all goes down
Heard it ain't no pity where you're at
And your dad don't know that your soul in lost and found

She don't want love
She don't love no one but herself
All she really cares about is a lace-front weave
And the boutiques from Chanel

What about lust?
What about lust? Do you trust yourself?
Anytime you walk out the door
It's a bag full of ones and lame nigga under your belt
But I won't judge
I won't judge, don't judge yourself
Promise I'm not here to burden you
I'm here to help (Na, for real)

If you're looking for someone to change you life
Change your life
I can be the one who can change your life
If you're looking for someone who can change your life
Baby, I can be the one that can change your life
And I know that you're young and you're filled with life
Ain't no need to be ashamed, I don't judge nor bite
If you're looking for someone who can change your life
Ain't no need to cry, baby, wipe your eyes

She don't want love
She don't love no one but herself
Only thing she cares about is a lace-front weave
And the boutiques from Chanel
She don't want love
She don't want love from no one else
She don't love no one but herself

I wanna amuse you, oh, let me use you
All for the good, not for the bad, I won't abuse you
Won't say I need you, too scared to lose you
Put down your pride, see through your eyes
Somebody bruised you
Know what you been through, I wan' avenge you
Act like you mad, act like you sad yet
But yet, pretend to
Say you love honesty, but yet, it offends you
Just hit my line, I got some lovin' I could lend you

If you're looking for someone to change you life
Change your life
I can be the one who can change your life
If you're looking for someone who can change your life
Baby, I can be the one that can change your life
And I know that you're young and you're filled with life
Ain't no need to be ashamed, I don't judge nor bite
If you're looking for someone who can change your life
Ain't no need to cry, baby, wipe your eyes

She don't want love
She don't love no one but herself
All she really cares about is a lace-front weave
And a bag that's from Chanel
She don't want love
She don't want love from no one else
She don't want love
All she love is herself
