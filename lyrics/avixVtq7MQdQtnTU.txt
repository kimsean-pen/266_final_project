I like to listen, like to listen to Beethoven
I like to listen, like to listen to Beethoven
I like to listen, like to listen to Beethoven
And when we kiss, I like to listen to Beethoven

Everything I ever wanted, everything I ever needed
Everything you ever wanted, everything you ever needed
Everything I ever wanted, everything I ever needed
Everything you ever wanted, everything you ever needed

I like to listen, like to listen to Beethoven
I like to listen, like to listen to Beethoven
I like to listen, like to listen to Beethoven
And when we kiss, I like to listen to Beethoven

Everything I ever wanted, everything I ever needed
Everything you ever wanted, everything you ever needed
Everything we ever wanted, everything we ever needed
Everything we ever wanted, everything we ever needed
Everything you ever wanted, everything you ever needed
Everything I ever wanted, everything I ever needed
Everything we ever wanted, everything we ever needed
Everything we ever wanted, everything we ever needed

I like to listen, like to listen to Beethoven
Everything you ever wanted, everything you ever needed
I like to listen, like to listen to Beethoven
Everything you ever wanted, everything you ever needed
I like to listen, like to listen to Beethoven
Everything you ever wanted, everything you ever needed
And when we kiss, I like to listen to Beethoven
Everything you ever wanted, everything you ever needed
