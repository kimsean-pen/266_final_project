You were way out of line
Went and turned it all around on me again
How can I not smell your lie
Through the smoke and arrogance?

But now I know
So you will not get away with it again
I'm distant in those hollow eyes
For I have reached my end

Thank you for
Makin' me
Feel like
I'm guilty
Makin' it
Easier to
Murder your sweet
Memory

Before I go tell me
Were you ever who you claimed yourself to be?
Either way I must say goodbye
You are dead to me

Thank you for
Makin' me
Feel like
I'm guilty
Makin' it
Easier to
Murder your sweet
Memory, I'm
Severin' the
Heart line, I'm
Leavin' your
Corpse behind
Not dead, but
Soon to be, though
I'm not gonna be the one that kills you

I'm gonna leave that up to you
I'm gonna leave that up to you
I'm gonna leave that up to you
I'm gonna leave that up to you (I told you so)

I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you

Severin' the
Heart line, I'm
Leavin' your
Corpse behind
Not dead, but
Soon to be and
I'm gonna be the one to say I told you so

I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
