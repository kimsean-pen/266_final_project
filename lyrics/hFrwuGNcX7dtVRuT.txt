You can have this dance with me
You can hold my hand and whisper
In my ear sweet words, that I
Love to hear
Whispers, sweet words in ear that I love to hear
Don't be shy (don't be shy), just take your time (just take your time)
I'd like to get to know you (to know you)
I'd like to make you mine
I've been waiting, sitting here so patiently
For you to come over
And have this dance with me
And my number is Beechwood 4-5789
You can call me up and have a date
Any old time

Don't be shy (don't be shy), just take your time (just take your time)
I'd like to get to know you
I'd like to make you mine
Beechwood 4-5789
You can call me up and have a date
Any old time

Don't be shy, just take your time
I'd like to get to know you
I'd like to make you mine
And my number is Beechwood 4-5789

Any old time
Beechwood 4-5789
