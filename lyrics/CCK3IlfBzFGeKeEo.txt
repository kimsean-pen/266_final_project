Here she comes down
As her wings get nailed to the ground
A polaroid of shame
The last angel's pathetic fame
The face of deceit
With nails in her feet
She's a preacher deprived from her voice
A punctured lung is creating noise
The cry that she made was the cry of a dying child
The revocation of empathy
The sound from a million dreams and scars
Termination Bliss
Blessed under a lie
Her last little, weak "why?"
The bloody end of a dream
Slit the throat and taste the cream
She wears her crown
On a head that's bowed deep down
A dying picture of lies
A tortured saint fed to the flies
The cry that she made was the cry of a dying child
The revocation of empathy
The sound from a million dreams and scars
Termination Bliss
Here she comes down
As her wings get nailed to the ground
A polaroid of shame
The face of deceit
With nails in her feet
She's a preacher deprived from her voice
A punctured lung is creating noise
The cry that she made was the cry of a dying child
The revocation of empathy
The sound from a million dreams and scars
Termination Bliss
The cry that she made was the cry of a dying child
The revocation of empathy
The sound from a million dreams and scars
Termination Bliss
