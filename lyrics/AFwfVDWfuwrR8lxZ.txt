When the lights start flashing
You can open up your eyes
And the highest mountain
Is the one that you have climbed

Yeah, I can look for love till the skies ain't blue I can look for love to get over you
I can look for love, for a deeper kiss
Nothing ever felt as good as this

Staring in your eyes I see the sunrise
There's nowhere else but right here, right now No deeper feeling, this is the thing
There's nowhere else but right here, right now

Ooh There's nowhere else but right here, right now
Ooh There's nowhere else but right here, right now

It's a never ending
Promise of the holy grail
But the space I'm in, it feels so real
Gotta sit back and exhale

Yeah, I can look for love, till the skies ain't blue I can look for love, to get over you
I can look for love, for a deeper kiss
Nothing ever felt as good as this

Staring in your eyes, I see the sunrise
There's nowhere else but right here, right now No deeper feeling, this is the real thing
There's nowhere else but right here, right now

Ooh There's nowhere else but right here, right now
Ooh There's nowhere else but right here, right now

It's the way you hold me tonight
'Cause the way you hold me tonight
Makes me feel like there's no place
I'd rather be right here, right now tonight You're right here, right now tonight

Ooh There's nowhere else but right here, right now
Ooh There's nowhere else but right here, right now
