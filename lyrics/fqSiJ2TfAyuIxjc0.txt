Lady, I know it was hard
But it's much harder to ignore
There's a chance and I'll promise
I won't hurt you anymore
Hollywood nights we're romancin'
You can trust me anytime
Somewhere, oh babe, there's someone
Oh you're dancing in my mind

Ohoho, little queenie
I'm your fool - come on
Teach me the rules
I will send a S.O.S. for love
Ohoho, little queenie
I'm your fool
You need love, like I do
I will send a S.O.S. for love

Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling, from the stars above
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop

If loving you is wrong, babe
Oh, I don't wanna be right
I've got you under my skin, babe
And baby, hold me tight
I'm ready for our romance
I wait a million years for you
I love you more than I'm saying
Baby, that's for me the truth

Ohoho, little queenie
I'm your fool - come on
Teach me the rules
I will send a S.O.S. for love
Ohoho, little queenie
I'm your fool
You need love, like I do
I will send a S.O.S. for love

Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling, from the stars above
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop

Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling, from the stars above
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
