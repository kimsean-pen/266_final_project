I know it's been so long
since we saw each other last
I'm sure we'll find some way
to make the time pass

Hey moon
It's just you and me tonight
everyone else is asleep
Hey moon
If I was to fall
I would fall so deep

Though I doubt I'm gonna,
You can wake me up if you wanna

And your pale, round face
makes me feel at home in any place
I would happen to be
At a quarter past three

The moon chased the sun out of the sky
Goodbye sun
the night's begun

The moon chased the sun out of the sky
Goodbye sunshine
the night is mine

Hey moon
It's just you and me tonight
everyone else is asleep
Hey moon
If I was to fall
I would fall so deep

Though I doubt I'm gonna,
You can wake me up if you wanna

I would hate for you to hang there alone
The whole night through

And I would love to spend the whole night
Just looking at you

And those seeds, little stars
You spread around
They make such a dramatic background

I don't care for sunbeams
No, I need the night to feed my dreams

And that's why
The moon chased the sun out of the sky
Goodbye sun
the night's begun

The moon chased the sun out of the sky
Goodbye sunshine
the night is mine

Hey moon
My old friend
Hey moon
The night is coming to and end
Hey moon
Come back soon
