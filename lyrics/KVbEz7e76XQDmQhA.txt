Look at us
We could paint a perfect picture
About us
From your head to toe I'll fit you
They follow us
Yeah we make 'em think it's fiction
They believe it so I guess it must be real

I can read your mind
I know what you're thinking
I could spend my time
Feeling all the reasons
What they know about us
Doesn't make a difference
Baby, we got us
We on something different

We on something, something, some-
We on something different
We on something, something, some-
We on something different
We on something, something, some-
We on something different
We on something, something, some-
We on something different

In a rush
Even though we young we flexin'
Fall in love
Bout' a hundred times a day
Like it's not enough
Yeah we make 'em think it's fiction
They believe it so I guess it must be real

I can read your mind
I know what you're thinking
I could spend my time
Feeling all the reasons
What they know about us
Doesn't make a difference
Baby, we got us
We on something different

We on something, something, some-
We on something different
We on something, something, some-
We on something different
We on something, something, some-
We on something different
We on something, something, some-
We on something different
