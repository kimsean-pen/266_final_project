I get up, and nothin' gets me down
You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around
And I know, baby just how you feel
You got to roll with the punches, and get to what's real
Ah, can't you see me standin' here I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah, can't you see what I mean?

Ah, might as well jump (Jump)
Might as well jump
Go ahead an' jump (Jump)
Go ahead and jump

Hey oh, hey you!
Who said that, baby, how you been?
You say you don't know, you won't know until you begin

So can't ya see me standing here I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah, can't you see what I mean?

Ah, might as well jump (Jump)
Go ahead and jump
Might as well jump (Jump)
Go ahead and jump
Jump!

Might as well jump (Jump)
Go ahead and jump
Get it and jump (Jump)
Go ahead and jump
Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
