We will fly, way up high, where the cold wind blows
Or in the sun, laughin' havin' fun, with all the people that she knows
And if the situation, should keep us separated, you know the world won't fall apart
And you will free the beautiful bird, that's caught inside your heart

Can't you hear her, oh she cries so loud
Casts her wild note, over water and cloud

That's the way it's gonna be little darlin'
We'll be riding on the horses, yeah yeah
Way up in the sky little darlin'
And if you fall I'll pick you up, pick you up

You will grow, and until you go, I'll be right there by your side
And even then, whisper the wind, and she will carry up your ride
I hear all the people of the world (people of the world), in one bird's lonely cry
See them tryin' every way they know how, to make their spirit fly

Can't you see him, he's down on the ground
He has a broken wing, looking all around

That's the way it's gonna be little darlin' (be little darlin')
You'll go riding on the horses, yeah yeah
Way up in the sky little darlin' (in the sky little darlin')
Oh, and if you fall I'll pick you up, pick you up

That's the way it's gonna be little darlin' (be little darlin')
You'll go riding on the horses, yeah yeah
Way up in the sky little darlin' (in the sky little darlin')
And if you fall I'll pick you up, pick you up

That's the way it's gonna be little darlin'
You'll go riding on the horses yeah yeah (Pick you up darlin' if you fall)
Way up in the sky little darlin' (Don't you worry 'bout a thing little girl)
And if you fall I'll pick you up, I'll pick you up (Because I was young myself not so long ago)

That's the way it's gonna be little darlin'
You'll go riding on the horses, yeah yeah
Way up in the sky little darlin'
And if you fall I'll pick you up, I'll pick you up

That's the way it's gonna be little darlin'
You'll go riding on the horses, yeah yeah
Way up in the sky little darlin' (And when I was young oh I was a wild one)
And if you fall I'll pick you up, I'll pick you up

That's the way it's gonna be little darlin'
