I'm holding on to white balloons, up against a sky of doom
Tell me you see them
'Cause what's inside of me is invisible to most
Even in clear view
I'm sending out a signal to the possibility of you
'Cause right at this moment
I know you are connected to a part of me
That I don't even know myself

The changes in me are likely to be like the weather
Stormy and clear, strength into fear bound together
But I'll break my silence
If I believe that you and me could ever be more than just
What's been behind us

I tried and left, they came and went
I got rejected out again
But no one believes me
I've worn a hundred faces
Of the character replacements and now
Nobody sees me
The changes in me are likely to be like the weather
Cloudy at best

Angels, lift me
Are you, with me
I'm holding on to you like I'm holding on to white balloons
Carry me away. I hope that you don't break

Angels, lift me
Are you, with me
I'm holding on to you like I'm holding on to white balloons
Carry me away. I hope that you don't break

I hope that you don't break, yeah. Don't break

'Cause what's inside of me is invisible to most
Even in clear view
