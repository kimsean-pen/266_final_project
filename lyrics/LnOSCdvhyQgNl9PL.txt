I'm drained but aching for more
And the devil inside is reading
The words of the saddest poem
To be engraved on the stone on my grave

I'd kill to share your pain (and carry the shame)
And sell my soul for you just to say:

"I dream what you're dreaming
And feel what you're feeling
Love's the shadow on our wall
With the face of God"

Nothing will be enough
For the ones who keep on stumbling
In the garden of withering trust
Without the courage to leave

I'd take my life for your kiss (grant me this)
And lose it all to take you across the abyss

I dream what you're dreaming
And feel what you're feeling
Love's the shadow on our wall
With the face of God

You dream what I'm dreaming
And see what I'm seeing
Love's our shadow on the wall
With the face of God

Labyrinth in the shape of a heart
Loves' secret architecture
I find myself to be lost in the
Arms of your fate

I'd kill to share your pain (please let me stay)
And sell my soul for you just to say
Loves name in vain
Again and again...

I dream what you're dreaming
And feel what you're feeling
Love's our shadow on the wall
With the face of God

You dream what I'm dreaming
And see what I'm seeing
Love's our shadow on the wall
With the face of God
