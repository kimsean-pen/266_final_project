I have a mind, a good memory
Here's how my life begins
I wasn't born from a woman's thighs
But from fire

I dwell on that dream
I don't want that to fade
I keep that dream
Until the axe does all that work

I was kept under the table
Raised from their sigh
I was worthless till the day
When flames did all the work

On the day I was born
They denied my rights
Even the right to die
