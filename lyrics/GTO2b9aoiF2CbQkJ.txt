i am never on time unless i am on your time
my watch says the wrong time, all of the time
i'm wrong

don't raise your voice to me
i don't care, i'll probably cry
and feel bad about feeling bad
why can't you just be nice?
but i guess that's too much to ask

and the older i get, the more i care about what people say
and i thought it wasn't supposed to be that way
i don't know

i am never on time unless i am on your time
my watch says the wrong time, all of the time
i'm wrong

and i hate everything that you love
and i'm afraid you're just the hook caught on my sleeve
i'm afraid it's my time to leave
we both know i oughta go
