Outside the gates of Cerdes
Sits the two-pronged unicorn
Plays at relaxation time
A rhinestone flugelhorn
While mermaids lace carnations
Into wreaths for ailing whales
Neptune dances hornpipes while Salome sheds her veils

Phallus Phil tries peddling
His pewter painted pot
But Sousa Sam can only hear
Screams of Peep the sot
Who only sips his creme de menthe from terra cotta cups
And exhales menthol scented breath whilst spewing verbiage up

Down technical blind alleys
Live the wraiths of former dreams
Greeps who often crossed them
Are no longer what they seem
And even Christian Scientists
Can but display marble plaques
Which only retell legends, while my eyes, ah, reach out for facts
Yeah, my eyes reach out for facts
