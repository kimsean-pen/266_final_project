Oh babe
Never thought I would be like this
Wide awake waiting on a goodnight kiss
Sipping 90 proof, talking to the moon
Counting down the hours till it's 2 a.m.
Never thought I would be like this

But as long as the night ends with you
in a yellow cab shooting me a text saying "coming home soon"
As long as I can bet on ya crawling into bed after slipping out your high heel shoes
I ain't lying, saying "Have a good time,
out with your girls, girl do what you do"
No matter how late, baby I'll be staying up
I can't sleep without you

I'd be tossing and turning all night babe
From the smell of your hair on the pillow case
Even if I tired without you by my side
I'd be dreaming with my eyes open
I'd be tossing and turning all night babe

But as long as the night ends with you
in a yellow cab shooting me a text saying "coming home soon"
As long as I can bet on ya crawling into bed after slipping out your high heel shoes
I ain't lying, saying "Have a good time,
out with your girls, girl do what you do"
No matter how late, baby I'll be staying up
I can't sleep without you, no
I can't sleep without you
Noo noo

I bet that DJs playin your song
and your carrying on
baby I love the thought of that long as I know I'm the one you're comin home to
But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab shootin' me a text sayin' comin' home soon
as long as I can bet on ya crawlin into bed after slippin out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin sayin havin a good time
out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late
baby I'll be stayin up
I can't sleep without you
Ya no matter how late I'll be stayin up cause I can't sleep without you No
Cant sleep without you
I cant sleep without you

Never thought I would be like this
just wide awake waitin on a goodnight kiss
