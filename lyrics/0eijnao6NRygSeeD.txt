Lost in the maze of the back streets I struggled
Fighting my way through a whole lot of trouble
Too many people were talking without moving their mouths

So many days so many nights ever wonder
By the lies that have stolen my thunder
In the haze of my mind all the wires were crossed

I love you but I'm lost

From a flame to the spark of an ember
To a fire on the 5th of November
We escaped from the light now we count the cost

I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost

Look at the marks on your arms all the colours
How you like to make them pay
These are the reasons why your life is not quite what it was

In a dream at the edge of a river
Where we swam where I watched you shiver
Came to life in my arms and then turned to dust

I love you but I'm lost

From a flame to the spark of an ember
To a fire on the 5th of November
We escaped from the light now we count the cost

I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost

All we needed was some time
All we needed was some time
All we needed was some time
All we needed was some time

I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost
