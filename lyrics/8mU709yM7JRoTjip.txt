For a moment
I felt the strength of your love
It was lightning, it was lightning
Strike down on me

I'm a lump of meat
With a heartbeat
Electricity restarts me
Strike down on me, on me

Everyday I pray
I'm the first to go
Without you I would be lost
I promised myself
I wouldn't talk about death
I know I'm getting boring

I'm a man
Holding the weight of your love
But without it my strength just isn't enough
So strike down on me, on me

Everyday I pray
I'm the first to go
Without you I would be lost
And I promised myself
I wouldn't sing about death
I know I'm getting boring

For a moment
I felt the weight of your love
It was lightning, it was lightning
Strike down on me
