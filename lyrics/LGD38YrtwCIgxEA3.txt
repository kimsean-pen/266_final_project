I had seen a million different people
A million different faces
None that I can't recall
I've hear a million people yelling
Ranting about nothing

Talking out of turn
And it's not enough to say; I want to get back home
And it's not enough to say; I never let go
And it not enough to say that I'll never let go
To say; I'll never let go

To say I'll never let go
I've been round and round in circles
Constantly repeating
'Who the hell are you?'
I feel nothing for the pretty
Lights that make you dizzy
Dancing in the day

Take this seriously
Don't be cynical
You won't see in this point of view
I've seen a million different people
A million different faces
None that I can't recall
And it's not enough to say; I wanna get back home
And it's not enough to say; I never let go
To say; I'll never let go
To say; I'll never let go
