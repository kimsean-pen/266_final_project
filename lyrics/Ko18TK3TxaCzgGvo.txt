rain drips down my walls
im sick of it all
im sick of it all
rain drips down my walls
im sick of it all
im sick of it all
losing time to the fight
you hit the floor then you cry
hit the floor then you crawl
i knew you once we were small
there isnt much i recall
we were losin it all
when you enter the hall
I know it wasnt your fault
know it wasnt your fault
kept your words in a box
guess you got what you deserved
without losin it all
I know it wasnt your fault
I know it wasnt your fault
kept your words in a box
guess you got what you deserved
without losin it all
The last words that you wrote out
I deleted them all
but the memories crawl
The last words that you wrote
I deleted them all
let the misery crawl
gave myself for it all
and now my pockets are full
you saw us doin it all
gave myself for it all
and now my pockets are full
you saw us doin it all
rain drips down my walls
im sick of it all
im sick of it all
rain drips down my walls
im sick of it all
im sick of it all
