Hey baby, where you going?
No please don't rush off so soon
If you leave me like this
What I'm gonna do

Finally my eyes are open
I dream about you all night long
The only thing that I've been hoping for
is before you to go to work babe, we get it on
I ain't tryin' to make you blush,
But I just wanted to tell ya, I think you're great
I know you're late, but I need another taste,
Breakfast can wait!

Grits and gravy, cheese eggs and jam
Can nobody cook it like you girl
No ma'am!
This here early morning, need something else on my plate
I think I want another bite of you
Breakfast can wait!

You really put it on me
You shut it down last night
I thought the police was gonna come (last night)
Loud, yeah, cryin'
Yeah, I ain't tryin' to make you blush
I just think you're great
Ain't no need to rush,

Finally my eyes are open
I dream about you all night long
The only thing that I've been hoping for
is before you to go to work babe, we get it on
I ain't tryin' to make you blush,
But I just wanted to tell ya, I think you're great
I know you're late, but I need another taste,
Breakfast can wait!

Hotcakes smothered in honey
(wait a minute)
I'm gon' have to pass
Fresh cup of coffee, no, no
I'd rather have you in my glass
Only thing's that gonna sweeten my tongue
Only thing that's gonna last now
Is another bite of you babe

Finally my eyes are open
I dream about you all night long
The only thing that I've been hoping for
Is before you to go to work babe, we get it on
I ain't tryin' to make you blush,
But I just wanted to tell ya, I think you're great
I know you're late, but I need another taste,
Breakfast can wait!
Breakfast can wait!

Can't stop even if the police come
Breakfast can wait!
