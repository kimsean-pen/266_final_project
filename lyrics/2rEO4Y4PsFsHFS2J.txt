When I walk in the room, I think about leaving
I could see that bitch, she was barely breathing
Something in the air, something in the air, something in the air
I think she knows about me and you upstairs

Should've never looked into those eyes
Should've never kept that promise

I think she knows about us, and I'm a dead girl walking
Caught up in those tragic lies
And now I'm just a dead girl walking

Back in a hotel, one room over
Picking on me like a four leaf clover
Bleeding through the walls, bleeding through the walls, bleeding through the walls
If she don't hear us, then it won't hurt her

I'm never cared about, this is murder
Making movies that we can't return
I'm a classic, no Turner, she a flip phone, she a burner
(No Turner here, fuck that bitch)

I think she knows about us, and I'm a dead girl walking
Caught up in those tragic lies
And now I'm just a dead girl walking
And I'm a dead girl walking, dead girl walking
Caught up on those tragic lies
And now I'm just a dead girl walking, dead girl walking
