We were above
You were standing underneath us
We were not yet lovers
Dragons were smoked
Bumblebees were stinging us
I was soon to be crazy
Eat drink and be merry
For tomorrow we die
Eat drink and be merry
For tomorrow we die
Cause we're tripping Billies

We're wearing nothing
Nothing but our shadows
Shadows falling down on
the beach sand
Remembering once, out on
the beaches
We wore pineapple grass bracelets

So why would you care
To get out of this place
You and me and all our friends
Such a happy human race
We're tripping Billies

We are all sitting
Legs crossed around a fire
My yellow flame she dances
Tequila drinking, oh,
our minds will wander
To wondrous places

So why would you care
To get out of this place
You and me and all our friends
Such a happy human race
Eat drink and be merry
For tomorrow we die
Eat drink and be merry
For tomorrow we die
