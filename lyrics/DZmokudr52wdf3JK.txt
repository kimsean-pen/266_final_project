Why don't you call me
What we both know I am?
Oh, you know I am
Oh, you know I am
Why don't you call me
What we both know I am?
What I am, what I am, what I am
Ooh
And I said why don't you call me
What we both know?
Why don't you call me
What we both know?
And I said why don't you call me
What we both know?
What I am, what I am, what I am
