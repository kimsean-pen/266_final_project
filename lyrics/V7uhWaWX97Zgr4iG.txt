Kindly disregard this one feeling
My clothes on the floor can be misleading
As soon as they're unpacked, they'll need to be put back
To me, it always seems I am leaving
Yes, to me it always seems I am leaving

This bed can be decieving
'Cause my time here is so fleeting
These bones hold the load of the open road
To me, it always seems I am leaving
Well, to me it just seems I am leaving

As soon as I arrive, I must say goodbye
All this despite my pleading
Those relentless miles are never satisfied
Never say you're here to stay

Tangled friends start unweaving
Like a thread from a quilt receding
Even though I'm home, I feel the most alone
To me, it always seems I am leaving
Well, to me it always seems I am leaving

As soon as I arrive, I must say goodbye
All this despite my pleading
Those relentless miles are never satisfied
Never say you're here to stay

There's no point in grieving, this pattern is just repeating
I've seen those tears before and there's something I ignore
To me it always seems I am leaving
Well, to me it always seems I am gone
