How are things on the West Coast?
I hear you movin' real fine.
You wear those shoes like a dove.
Now strut those shoes, we'll go roaming in the night.

Well, how are things on the West Coast?
You keep it movin' to your soul's delight.
Now, I've tried the brakes.
I've tried but you know it's a lonely ride.

How are things on the West Coast?
Oh, and move heaven behind those eyes.

Today my heart swings.
Yeah, today my heart swings.

But I don't want to take your heart
and I don't want a piece of history.
No, I don't want to read your thoughts anymore.
My God.

'Cause today my heart swings.
Yeah, today my heart swings.

How are things on the West Coast?
Hear you movin' real fine tonight.
You wear those shoes, side to side.
Oh, strut those shoes, we'll go roaming in the night.

Well how are things on the West Coast?
Yeah, but you're an actress I don't identify.

Today my heart swings.
Yeah, today my heart swings.
Say it.

But I don't want to play the part
and I don't want a taste of victory.
No, I don't want to read your thoughts anymore.
My God.

'Cause today my heart swings.
Yeah, today my heart swings.

Say it.
'Cause today my heart swings.
Yeah, today my heart swings.
Let it come.
'Cause I've got a chance for a sweet saint life.
I said, I've got a dance and you'll do just fine.
Well I've got a plan, look forward in my eyes.
Let it come.
Well I've got a chance for a sweet saint life.
I said I've got a dance, it moves into the night.
Well I've got a plan, look forward in my eyes.
Well today my heart swings.
