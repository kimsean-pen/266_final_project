Stop, you can hope that you want it
Stepped in a trap oh and a quick stop
Something that's talking about war
Why you gotta be like
Love lost without the captain
Take your time, you always act like
World War four is knocking right at your door
Will you be around now?

Young legends die all the time
But I don't mind, don't close your eyes
Don't say goodbye, I'll be unkind
Don't do it, don't do it
Young legends die all the time
But I don't mind, don't close your eyes
Don't say goodbye, I know you tried
Young legends die and so will...

Stop, you had everything counted
You never doubted, want to be only a day away
Where you gonna go now?
Shut me down, I'm too illegal
Underground we'll last forever
So if I go on your way down, let's go now

Young legends die all the time
But I don't mind, don't close your eyes
Don't say goodbye, I'll be unkind
Don't do it, don't do it
Young legends die all the time
But I don't mind, don't close your eyes
Don't say goodbye, I know you tried
Young legends die and so will...

Young legends die
Young legends die
Young legends die all the time
Young legends die all the time

Young legends die all the time
But I don't mind, don't close your eyes
Don't say goodbye, I'll be unkind
Don't do it, don't do it
Young legends die all the time
But I don't mind, don't close your eyes
Don't say goodbye, I know you tried
Young legends die and so will...

And so will...
And so will...
