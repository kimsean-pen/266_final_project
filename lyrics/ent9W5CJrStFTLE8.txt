Hide your eyes and turn away
You can't come out today
There's no way
Staring through the window pane
At the poring rain
She don't complain

Walk on, face numb, a half gone
Never one for having fun
Always taught to hold your tongue

So you thought you could please him, did you?
So you thought it'd be easy, did you?

Deny that made you want it more
In spite of what you're asking for
Tonight the waves approach the shore
Just to escape from this twisted space
And they're knocking at your door

Tell yourself it's all okay
Bring in another day
You cry out in vain
Tangled up and beaten down
A voice that echoes through the ground again

A show's on, a day's long, a shame gone
Working 'til the morning sun
But no one's waiting when you're done

So you thought you could please him, did you?
So you thought it'd be easy, did you?

Deny the things you wanted more
In spite of what you're asking for
Tonight the waves approach the shore
Just to escape from this twisted space
And they're knocking at your door

They're gonna try to tell you who you are
They're gonna try to show you who you are
They're gonna try to tell you who you are
They're gonna try to show you who you are
