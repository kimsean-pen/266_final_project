Forever, carry me to safety
I can tell, I can tell
You wish me well
Thirty thousand, there is someone louder
Give them hell, give them hell
Until the bell

As I run, I wave to everyone
To each and every beholder
And I so want to be grateful
But nothing keeps me, so I'm just coming home

Pain in my chest
Promised you I'd fix this
But I'm almost done
Ouch! Injury
I can run no longer
Carry me, carry me to safety

As I run, I wave to everyone
To each and every
Beholder
And I still want to be grateful
But nothing keeps me, so I'm just coming back home

A life to live as me
A moment that feels free
But you've been colliding
Singing out the days
You smile as if to say
Now my story's done

Built physical structures
Mountainous landscapes, the colourful lights, and it's still lonely inside
Built physical structures
Mountainous landscapes, the colourful lights, and it's still lonely inside

Come, let's wave to everyone
They came all this way
To see us absolve our
Enemies and ghosts
To catch the atom show
We're just coming home
