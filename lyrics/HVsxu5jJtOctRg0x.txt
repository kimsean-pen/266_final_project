Shake it
Shake it

I can do this all night
All those things you like
Got you high as a kite
Like the way I shake it
Let's get out of here come on
Where's your car, take me home
Up the stairs, close the door

And then my skirt came down
Down, down, down
And then my skirt came down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down (Shake it)
And then my skirt came

Let's get out of here, come on
Let's get out of here, come on
Let's get out of here, come on
Let's get out of here, come on
Let's get out of here, come on

Tonight be my supernova take whatever you want
Tonight let me bask in you like rays of the sun
Tonight I'm yours
Tonight we're one
We're one

And then my skirt came down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
And then my skirt came

Like the way I shake it
Like the way I shake it
Like the way I shake it
Like the way I shake it
Like the way I shake it
Like the, like the, like the

That's when my skirt came
That's when my skirt came
That's when my skirt came
And then my skirt came down

Tonight be my supernova take whatever you want
Tonight let me bask in you like rays of the sun
Tonight I'm yours
Tonight we're one
