Oh man I'm a loner
A night time roamer
Emptiness haunts me and that's how I know
I am a brokenhearted soul
And I've hit rock bottom so where do I go
All I need
Is for your love to save me
Begging please
I think I'm going crazy
All I know
Is that I'm losing my grip

As I lay me down to sleep
I wish that you were here with me
'Cause I need some help to save me from myself
And I know I shouldn't think about you but I do
All the time
My oh my
My oh my

Oh man I'm a stumbler
A straight a rumbler
Looking for trouble wherever I go
And night time is calling
My judgement is falling
And I won't give up 'til the sun comes up
All I know
Is that I'm losing my grip

As I lay me down to sleep
I wish that you were here with me
'Cause I need some help to save me from myself
And I know I shouldn't think about you but I do
All the time

As I wake up in despair
You know I say a little prayer
'Cause I need some help to save me from myself
And I know I shouldn't think about you but I do
All the time
My oh my
My oh my
My oh my

Darling I need you
More than I want to
So as I lay me down
Won't you save me?

As I lay me down to sleep
I wish that you were here with me
'Cause I need some help to save me from myself
And I know I shouldn't think about you but I do
All the time

As I wake up in despair
You know I say a little prayer
'Cause I need some help to save me from myself
And I know I shouldn't think about you but I do
All the time
My oh my
My oh my
