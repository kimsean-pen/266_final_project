I didn't cry the day you moved away
I didn't think that I could feel this pain
Until I saw the stranger that was you
Whatever happened to our innocence
And the something that you said about being friends
Tell me how
Help me say the words out loud

Could it be
That nothing's gonna change
'Cause time has got a way of taking back
Everything you thought you had
Can't you see
The girl you used to be
The one I lost when I let go of you
Oh whatever happened to
Mary Jane
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

I need to wake up from this state of mind
The situation is the same kind
I gotta get your memory out of my head
Would you catch me if I had to fall
Would you even find the time for that at all
Tell me how
Help me say the words out loud

Could it be
That nothing's gonna change
Time has got a way of taking back
Everything you thought you had
Can't you see
The girl you used to be
The one I lost when I let go of you
Oh whatever happened to
Mary Jane
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

'Cause time has taken back
Everything I thought we had
Mary Jane

Could it be
Nothing's gonna change
'Cause time has got a way of taking back
Everything you thought you had
Can you see
The girl you used to be
The one I lost when I let go of you
Oh whatever happened to
Mary Jane
Ooh ooh
Oh whatever happened to
Ooh ooh
Mary Jane
