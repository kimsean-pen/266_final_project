With the world to win behind us
Out here shunned for all to see
Dirty the tub with our bodies to remind us
Of our defeat at Calvary
They'll say our whole life is a locust
Disturbing their fascist peace
But it is they who mangle our horizons
Of our defeat at Calvary
And I see the light and I see the sea
Despite the future crashing down and closing over me
I can't tower over all my enemies
Listen to the martyrs cry for me
And I see the light and I see the sea
The sun is going down but everyone leaves me burnin'
I see the winning on the other side of history
Listen to the martyrs cry for me
With the world to win behind us
Out here shunned for all to see
Dirty the tub with our bodies to remind us
Of our defeat at Calvary
They'll say our whole life is a locust
Disturbing their fascist peace
But it is they who mangle our horizons
Of our defeat at Calvary
Hey, ha let's go wreak some violence
Reduce our memories to silence
We're passing all the stories of the unsung and unseen
Listen to the martyrs cry for me
'Cause I seen the light and I seen the sea
I'm waiting for the [?], I'm waiting for perdition
I can't carry myself, I will die in peace
Listen to the martyrs cry
With the world to win behind us
Out here shunned for all to see
Dirty the tub with our bodies to remind us
Of our defeat at Calvary
They'll say our whole life is a locust
Disturbing their fascist peace
But it is they who mangle our horizons
Of our defeat at Calvary
