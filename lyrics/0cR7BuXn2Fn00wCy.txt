When the waves come crashing down
And you feel you're gonna drown
I swear I'll be there to pull you out
And there'll be hard times, there'll be pain
Whatever obstacles we face
We can do it all our way

You're the oxygen I need to survive
When you're running out of air
You'll be there by my side
And now I'm begging you please
Don't take this life, life from me
When it's the only thing I need
Ohh.
You're the air that I breathe

So I will be there by your side
Even when your hope has died
I will let this ship kept size
And if you're straight too far from shore
And you're lost without a course
I'll be your anchor through it all

You're the oxygen I need to survive
When you're running out of air
You'll be there by my side
And now I'm begging you please
Don't take this life, life from me
When it's the only thing I need
Ohh.
You're the air that I breathe
