Pulled the trigger and you were shaking
It's life was yours for the taking
Strung it up to a white fir tree
Cut it's neck and let it bleed
And every drop of blood that landed in the mud
Well I lost all feeling

It will be quick but I'll be clever
In the mountains on a cold day
You can run but you won't get away
And every time they screamed
They sounded like machines to me

You are numb from the grief and the pain
Your heart is broken but it's dripping from your veins
And you will never feel the same

And you will never feel their pain
Like every drop of blood that landed in the mud
Well I lost all feeling
Pulled the trigger and you where shaking
It's him or you and you're not waiting
Pushed him down to his knees
And he was begging don't kill me please
And every time they screamed
They sounded like machines to me

You are numb from the grief and the pain
Your heart is broken bodies lie in their graves
And you will never feel the same
And you will never feel the same
And you will never feel the same
And you will never feel the same
