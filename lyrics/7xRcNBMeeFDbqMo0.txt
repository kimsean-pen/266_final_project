I'm a stupid
So stupid
And a hopeless
Romantic
I guess I'm damaged
But I'll manage
In my room, all by myself
Be dramatic

Alright, I'm lazy
And fucking crazy
And you think I'm putting on some kind of act
But this is me, being me
And you know what's sick?
I kinda like it
That nobody I know really lives like this
But I love it

And I'll say anything you want, 'cause I'm leaving in the morning
And maybe I should try to fall in love, but that just seems so boring
Too late to die young, and too young to burn out
(I'm so burnt out)
Or I can fade away, I just say that I'm happy
Now leave me alone
Leave me alone

I'm stupid
So stupid
And nothing in the world's gonna change my mind
So you can suck it
And I'm perfect
And I'm so worth it
I'm pretty, oh, so pretty, look at me
You know you want it

I'll say anything you want, 'cause I'm leaving in the morning
And maybe I should fall in love, but that just seems so boring
Too late to die young, and too young to burn out
(I'm so burnt out)
Or I can fade away, I just say that I'm happy
Now leave me alone
