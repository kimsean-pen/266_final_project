Well, I saw a lot of trees today and they were all made of wood.
They were wooden trees and they were made entirely of wood.

I came home today and you were all on fire.
Your shirt was on fire, and your hair was on fire,
And flames were licking all around your feet.
And I did not know what to do!
And then a thousand violins began to play,
And I really did not know what to do then.
So I just decided to go out and walk the dog.

I went to the movies, and I saw a dog thirty feet high.
And this dog was made entirely of light.
And he filled up the whole screen.
And his eyes were long hallways.
He had those long, echoing, hallway eyes.

I turned on the radio and I heard a song by Dolly Parton.
And she was singing:
Oh! I feel so sad! I feel so bad!
I left my mom and I left my dad.
And I just want to go home now.
I just want to go back in my Tennessee mountain home now.
Well, you know she's not gonna go back home.
And I know she's not gonna go back home.
And she knows she's never gonna go back there.
And I just want to know who's gonna go and walk her dog.

Oh! I feel so bad. I feel so sad.
But not as bad as the night I wrote this song.

Close your eyes! (OK)
Now imagine you're at the most wonderful party. (OK)
Delicious food. (Uh huh.)
Interesting people. (Mm hmm.)
Terrific music. (Mn hmmh.)
Now open them! (Oh no.)
Well, I just want to go home now and walk the dog.
