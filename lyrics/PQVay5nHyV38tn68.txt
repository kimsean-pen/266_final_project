Strange fear I ain't felt for years
The boy's comin' and I'm close to tears
I can't let go
Of you now

Imagination's playing round for free
In my world I take him out for tea
Oh my god
He can't say no

Skippin' school, gonna walk for e'er
I just had to get out of there
I'm on overload
In my head

Train comes, I don't know its destination
It's a one way ticket to a mad man's situation
Train comes, I don't know its destination
It's a one way ticket to a mad man's situation

Life in a dream time does come true
And in my sleep I think of you
Feather bed
By myself

Basically probability
Says that fate's gonna side with me
It's been so long
On my shelf

Train comes, I don't know its destination
It's a one way ticket to a mad man's situation
Train comes, I don't know its destination
It's a one way ticket to a mad man's situation

The tension is incredible
Boy I'm in charge
You know how I feel for you
Will you stop or will you just keep goin'
Please don't say no (noo noo)

Train comes, I don't know its destination (yeah yeah yeah)
It's a one way ticket to a mad man's situation (situation)
Train comes, I don't know its destination (I know, I know)
It's a one way ticket to a mad man's situation (situation)
Train comes, I don't know its destination (I'll sleep with any man)
It's a one way ticket to a mad man's situation (situation)
Train comes, I don't know its destination (I know, I know)
It's a one way ticket to a mad man's situation (got me feeling sad)
