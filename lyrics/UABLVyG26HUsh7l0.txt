You have my attention, there is not a question.
You know what I'm feeling. You'll show me the way out.
It's a certain feeling that I can't describe.
I see your face when I close my eyes
There's something that's missing. I'm not one to listen
You've told me before but my ears are all yours now.
It has to be now or never
You can't wait on me forever

And if you know me all so well,
You know I haven't been so well
And if you know me all so well,
You know I haven't been so well lately.

I said I would try to get through this
But we know it won't last forever.
Don't let me go. (Don't let me go)

I said I would try to get through this
But we know it won't last forever.
Don't let me go. (Don't let me go, don't let me go)

This could be
This could be the death of us all

I won't keep you waiting, I know that I'm changing
This just gives me reason to prove that I'm willing
I almost close down from all that I hide.
I know things are better when you're by my side.
I'm hoping you see that I'm honestly trying
To keep my ways clean and to show you a better side
This is it, a new me for you.
A new beginning is all I can do.

I said I would try to get through this
But we know it won't last forever.
Don't let me go. (Don't let me go)

I said I would try to get through this
But we know it won't last forever.
Don't let me go. (Don't let me go, don't let me go)

If I believed in myself
As much as I believe in you
This would be so much easier
But it's not so come and get me.

I can't keep bringing myself down.
I tear myself apart.
It has to stop.

I said I would try to get through this
But we know it won't last forever.
Don't let me go. (Don't let me go)

I said I would try to get through this
But we know it won't last forever.
Don't let me go. (Don't let me go, don't let me go)

And if you know me all so well,
You know I haven't been so well
