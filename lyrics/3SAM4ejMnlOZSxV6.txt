The first time, ever i saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars
Were the gifts you gave
To the dark, and the endless sky

And the first time, ever i kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like the trembling heart
Of a captive bird
That was there, at my command
My love

And the first time, ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And i know our joy
Would fill the earth
And last, til the end of time
My love

The first time, ever I saw
Your face
Your face
Your face
Your face
