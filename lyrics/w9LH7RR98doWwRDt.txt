Tell me why this world is a mess
I thought you always tried your best
Tell me, what am I to do?
Maybe you should do it, too
Tell me why they're sleeping alone
No house, nowhere to call a home
Tell me what I'm meant to see
Won't you stop preaching at me?

And I wanna see what it's all about
And I wanna live, wanna give something back

Don't tell me that it's over
It's only just begun
Don't tell me that it's over
Now that this song is sung
The song is sung

All the money in the world
Would never set all the wrongs to right
All the fire in the world
Would never set my heart alight
I dream of a day when it's all gone away
And the sun is shining bright
I dream of a day when it's all gone away
But dreams are for night

And I wanna see what it's all about
And I wanna live, wanna give something back

Don't tell me that it's over
It's only just begun
Don't tell me that it's over
Now that this song is sung
The song is sung

Don't tell that it's over, please
I'm on my knees
I'm begging you to stop
It's over, please
I'm on my knees
I'm begging you to stop

And I wanna see what it's all about
And I wanna live
Wanna give something back

Don't tell me that it's over
It's only just begun
Don't tell me that it's over
Now that this song is sung
The song is sung
