Omaha, Omaha
Where you been?
When we meet we can talk awhile
I can sleep in your dreams
The night alone I've been waiting

Omaha, Omaha
The saddled streets, the burro beats down my door
When you say it's no love affair
I will know and when we go
I'll be the only thing who cares

I've been waiting awhile
I've been waiting awhile
I've been waiting awhile
I've been waiting awhile

Here I come, Omaha
Hiding out
I got hot head, hot eyes, hot ticks, hot mouth
Each howl, I get bigger
I can't stay, I can for the night, for the night
For the weekend and the night
I've been aiding my fall
Aiding my fall, aiding my fall
I'll be long gone

You shouldn't wake me awhile
You shouldn't wake me awhile
You shouldn't wake me awhile
You shouldn't wake me awhile
