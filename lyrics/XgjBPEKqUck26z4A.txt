Just cuz you can't think straight
Just cuz you can't think straight
Doesn't mean you put it on hold
Just cuz you can't think straight

Doesn't mean that you leave
Everything we built but especially me
Doesn't mean you leave everything in the air
And I know it was my idea but it still isn't fair

I said fight for you first, fight for me second
And it's really fucking hard cuz I know that I meant it, so
Are you gonna leave, are you gonna stay
Part of me just wants to call it off either way

Just cuz you can't think straight
Doesn't mean you put it on hold
I haven't eaten in days
I think I'm leaving you tomorrow
Just cuz you can't think straight
Doesn't mean you put it on hold
I haven't eaten in days
I think I'm leaving you tomorrow
Just cuz you can't think straight

I gotta keep up my head
Gotta wake up in the morning gotta make up our bed
I think you can't even lay in the mess that you made
But it's warmer in New York than it is in LA

I gotta fight for you second, fight for me first
I'm just waiting for you to translate feelings into words, except
Do I wanna leave, do I wanna stay
Everything's just fucked up at least you're getting your way

Just cuz you can't think straight
Doesn't mean you put it on hold
I haven't eaten in days
I think I'm leaving you tomorrow
Just cuz you can't think straight
Doesn't mean you put it on hold
I haven't eaten in days
I think I'm leaving you tomorrow
Just cuz you can't think straight

Just cuz you can't think straight
Doesn't mean you put it on hold
I haven't eaten in days
I think I'm leaving you tomorrow
Just cuz you can't think straight
Doesn't mean you put it on hold
I haven't eaten in days
I think I'm leaving you tomorrow
Just cuz you can't think straight
Just cuz you can't think straight
Just cuz you can't think straight
Just cuz you can't think straight
