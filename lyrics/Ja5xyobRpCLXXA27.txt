This song doesn't end when it's over
This song doesn't end when it's over

Oh no, it goes on in your mind
Oh, I sing, and it stings you
And now, my work is done

Do you recall when I was in love with you?
Do you recall the lengths I would go to?
I must've been out of my mind

This song doesn't end just because it's over
No, it goes on in your head, in your hospital bed
You'll hear me instead of drip, drip, drip

Oh, it goes on in your mind
I sing, it stings you
And now, my work is done

Do you recall when I was in love with you?
Do you recall the lengths I would go to?
I must've been out of my mind

Oh no, it goes on in your mind
I sing, and it stings you
And now, my work is done

Do you recall when I was in love with you?
Do you recall the lengths I would go to?
No mountain to hide, there were miles of smiles
No repulsive expense could ever not make sense
It's great to be out of your mind
