I walked ten thousand miles, ten thousand miles to see you
And every gasp of breath I grabbed at just to find you
I climbed up every hills to get, to you
I wondered ancient lands to hold, just you
And every single step of the way, I pay-hey hey hey hey
Every single night and day
I searched for you
Through sandstorms and hazy dawns I reached for you
I stole ten thousand pounds, ten thousand pounds to see you
I robbed convenient stores cause I thought they'd make it easier
I lived off rats and toads, and I starved for you
I fought off giants bears and I killed them too
And every single step of the way, I pay-hey hey hey hey
Every single night and day
I searched for you
Through sandstorms and hazy dawns I reached for you
I'm tired and I'm weak, but I'm strong for you
I wanna go home, but my love gets me through
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
