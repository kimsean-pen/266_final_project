"Ha-ha... okay, dog..."

[Kim]
Turquoise boy, I must confess to you,
sweet liberation has come
You are a legend in a lovely game,
but now I feel I must run

Turquoise boy, the sky is calling me
Sweet isolation in the sun
You are a soldier in a sad charade
How do you lose what's never found?

Turquoise boy, I must confess to you,
sweet liberation has come
You are a legend in a lovely game,
but now I feel I must run
