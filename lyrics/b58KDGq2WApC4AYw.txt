Waste no more energy
No more time
Step into the time machine
Aboard this flight

Time to go
It's sad that you're not here
To open up your eyes and...
Watch me disappear

Carried away
Imaginations are running wild

Losing control
I'm landing back in this year
Did I ever move?
Did I disappear?
If I could move through time
I'd go back and put it right
