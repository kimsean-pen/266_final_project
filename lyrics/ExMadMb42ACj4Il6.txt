I smoke weed, eat pussy every day
And every day is kind of the same
I have fun, and I feel no shame
I smoke weed, eat pussy every day
And I've always been at this game
We have fun when we play this game
Everybody knows my name
We have fun when we play this game
And I will never be your baby
'Cause I'm a motherfucking lady
I hit the blunt like I'm Slim Shady
Yeah, I'm a motherfucking lady
And I've always been at this game
We have fun when we play this game
Everybody knows my name
We have fun when we play this game
I smoke weed, eat pussy every day
And every day is kind of the same
I have fun, and I feel no shame
I smoke weed, eat pussy every day
And I've always been at this game
We have fun when we play this game
Everybody knows my name
We have fun when we play this game
I smoke weed, eat pussy all the time
Straight bargain day, all stand in line
It doesn't really matter
I don't know what to say
They got a thing from my ass
And I'm here to play
And I will never be your baby
'Cause I'm a motherfucking lady
I hit the blunt like I'm Slim Shady
Yeah, I'm a motherfucking lady
I smoke weed, eat pussy every day
And every day is kind of the same
I have fun, and I feel no shame
I smoke weed, eat pussy every day
And I will never be your baby
