You exist in material states
One part paper one part weight
You could not decide what force is holding you down today
It was never my place

I could dare you to move but it would sound so dumb
You are my wrecking ball through a condominium
Let me stare off a rooftop afar
Thought I belonged in the canopy
Satisfied with all the deconstruction I could see

The firmament hangs
The world rejoices as all it's retained goes away
