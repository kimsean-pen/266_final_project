You and me, satin sheets and privacy
Five 'til three, thinking maybe you should leave
Didn't mean to rush you, didn't know if I could trust you
'Cause I want something, something with substance
But I need to decide while it's fresh on my mind
I wanna savor this, I want you to wait for this

I hope you know I wanted you to stay
But trust me it gets better if we wait
Like peaches off the tree I wanna taste
But they're better if we go the perfect pace

Something like sweet moonshine
Lovin' gets better with time (Gets better with time)
Like sweet moonshine
Lovin' gets better with time, better with time

Company, I really want your company
You don't know what's good
Until you've had a taste of Tennessee, yeah

I hope you know I wanted you to stay
But trust me it gets better if we wait
Like peaches off the tree I wanna taste
But they're better if we go the perfect pace

Something like sweet moonshine
Lovin' gets better with time (Gets better with time)
Like sweet moonshine
Lovin' gets better with time, better with time
Something like sweet moonshine
Lovin' gets better with time (Gets better with time)
Like sweet moonshine
Lovin' gets better with time, better with time

Better with time
Better, better with time
Like sweet moonshine
Like sweet moonshine
Better with time
Better, better with time
Like sweet moonshine, woah

Something like sweet moonshine
Lovin' gets better with time (Gets better with time)
Like sweet moonshine
Lovin' gets better with time, better with time
Something like sweet moonshine
Lovin' gets better with time (Gets better with time)
Like sweet moonshine
Lovin' gets better with time, better with time
