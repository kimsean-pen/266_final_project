I'm up here
I'm so high
I feel everything
I feel nice

I'm untouchable
I'm so true
I can't win
And I can't lose

Now that I'm in heaven
Now that I'm in heaven with you

Our eyes like quarters
Sweet spine
Someone's calling
I don't mind

Now that I'm in heaven
Now that I'm in heaven with you
Now that I'm in heaven
Now that I'm in heaven with you

Heaven
Now that I'm in heaven with you
Now that I'm in heaven
Now that I'm in heaven with you

We set sail for stormy waters
I'm gonna buy a house
And fill it with daughters
And daughters and daughters and daughters and

Heaven
Now that I'm in heaven with you
Now that I'm in heaven
Now that I'm in heaven with you
