Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
If I make you feel second best
I'm so sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give to me, one more chance to keep you satisfied

You were always on my mind
You are always on my mind

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
