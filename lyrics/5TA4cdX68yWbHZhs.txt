When the knife finds us,
Hopeless on the merge of time,
Where things take colorless shapes of nothing.
Awaiting to be served with the unexpected stroke of the blade.
We observe as things unfold,
Relieving the unknown from the weight of expectations.
Another wheel has turned,
Left me for dead.

Nails in my head

Shattered dreams,
A castle of hate,
I built through time to host my nightmares.
Endless guests, filling the space in the walls at the castle of hate.
Visions of death,
As we part from life,
Drowning in depths,
In this emptiness.

Fade away into nothingness.
Fade away into the void.

Fragments of words lost in my head.
Pieces of me I cannot leave behind.
A wound that drips down to my feet,
Fixed to this pain to taste reality.

The cut of the blade.
To taste the blade.
The cut of the blade.

Fade away
Into nothingness
Fade away
Into the void

Nails in my head.

Taste the blade, cold as ice,
A burning cut, a burning night.

Show me the way, the way to die.
Don't leave me longing for the blade.
