She's so easy to fall for

But boy, she's so hard to hold
She looks at you like a warning
You know you're gonna be hungry
When you get home
Her lips make the cherries and the berries
And the apples look pale

She could ask anything, you would do anything
No matter what you would obey

And she turns every room into a dancefloor
When she turns and she sways and she spins
And you're standing still like a statue
And you can't take your eyes off her skin

Oh boy, you better slow it down

You're running on unsolid ground
She'll never slow down for you
Oh boy, you'll never wear that crown
You're just one of one hundred clowns
I know it's sad but it's true

Everything that she touches
Every word from her mouth turns to gold

How can you ever catch her eye when
She's all colors and heat
You're all grey and cold
You keep looking up
But she'll never ever look down
Oh look at this part you've chosen

You're the jester of the queen
She's the queen of the town

And you wish she was in a movie
You could watch at home ten times a day
Where you could just sit without having to think
About something important to say

Oh boy, you better slow it down
You're running on unsolid ground
She'll never slow down for you

Oh boy, you'll never wear that crown
You're just one of one hundred clowns

I know it's sad but it's true

You should go home boy
You should call a friend
Someone to tell you
There's no happy way for this to end
Shut your eyes boy
Don't let them fool you
See all this beauty
It's looking through you
Put out that fire boy
Don't let it eat you
Don't you know it's dangerous
What did your daddy teach you
It's not your fault and
It's not her fault but
You should go home, boy
(Oh)
Oh boy, you better slow it down
You're running on unsolid ground
She'll never slow dance with you
Oh boy, you'll never wear that crown
You're just one of one hundred clowns
I know it's sad, but it's true
Oh boy
