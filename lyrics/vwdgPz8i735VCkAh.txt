I was sent to outer space to find another happy place
Now I'm left here all alone, million miles away from home
Floating through the galaxy, all the stars in front of me
Now I'm left here all alone, million miles away from home

Million miles away, million miles away
Million miles away, million miles away
Million miles away, million miles away
Million miles away, million miles away

I was sent to outer space to find another happy place
Now I'm left here all alone, million miles away from home
Floating through the galaxy, all the stars in front of me
Now I'm left here all alone, million miles away from home

I was sent to outer space to find another happy place
Now I'm left here all alone, million miles away from home
Floating through the galaxy, all the stars in front of me
Now I'm left here all alone, million miles away from home

Million miles away, million miles away
Million miles away, million miles away
Million miles away, million miles away
Million miles away, million miles away

I was sent to outer space to find another happy place
Now I'm left here all alone, million miles from home
Floating through the galaxy, all the stars in front of me
Now I'm left here all alone, million miles from home

I was sent to outer space to find another happy place
Now I'm left here all alone, million miles away from home
Floating through the galaxy, all the stars in front of me
Now I'm left here all alone, million miles away from home
