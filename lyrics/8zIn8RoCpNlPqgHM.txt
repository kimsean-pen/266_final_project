Well, she's show showing it off then
The glitter in her lovely eyes
Show, show showing it off then
And all the people shake their money in time

She sells hearts
She sells meat
Oh, dad, she's driving me mad
Come see

We shake, shake, shake to the trumpet
And through the slippery city we ride
Skyline swine on the circuit
Where all the people shake their money in time

She sells hearts
She sells meat
Oh, dad, she's driving me mad
Come see

She sells hearts
She sells meat
Oh, dad, she's driving me mad
Come see

She sells hearts
She sells meat
She sells hearts
She sells meat

She sells hearts
She sells meat
She sells hearts
She sells meat

She sells hearts
She sells meat
She sells hearts
She sells meat
