When I was a little girl I had a rag doll
Only doll I've ever owned
Now I love you just the way I loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown

And it gets stronger in every way
And it gets deeper, let me say
And it gets higher day by day
Do I love you, my oh my

River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you, would I cry?

Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby
When you were a young boy did you have a puppy
That always followed you around?

Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No I'll never let you down

'Cause it grows stronger like a river flows
And it gets bigger baby, and heaven knows
And it gets sweeter baby as it grows
Do I love you, my oh my

River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you, would I cry?
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring

And I love you baby like a robin loves to sing
And I love you baby like a schoolboy loves his bag

And I love you baby, river deep, mountain high
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby, ooh yeah yeah, yeah
Do I love you, my oh my
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you, would I cry?
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby
