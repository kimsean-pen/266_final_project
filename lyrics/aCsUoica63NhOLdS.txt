You are better than me, girls, money, and everything I try to compete with you,
but you beat me at everything i do
I see in you the things that would like to be
But im different from you,

So I guess you'll have to be like me.

I cannot be bought my personality is what I choose
I was brought up without a silver cup I wont
covet the thing owned by you

For all the world material things are now more and more
jealousy for me and you won't covet the
things owned by your store
