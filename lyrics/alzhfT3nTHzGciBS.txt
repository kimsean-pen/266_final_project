We slither out on a Tuesday
Feeling tired and hopeless
And I don't know why
This life is a wonder
This life is a wonder

Help me see through yesterday
I need a barricade
I need an extra life
My body's a wonder
My body's a wonder

Break out the health machine
It makes us live it up
It keeps us free and clean
It gives my heart the beat
And I don't know why

I look over to my best friend
They have weakness
They are pale and tired
I know how to save them
I know how to save them

Break out the health machine
It makes us live it up
It keeps us free and clean
It gives my heart the beat
And I don't know why
