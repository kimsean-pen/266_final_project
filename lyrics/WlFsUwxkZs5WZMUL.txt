I can feel your body
When I'm lying in my bed
Too much confusion
Going around through my head

It makes me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over?
When will I ever learn?

Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home

I can see your face
But I know that it's not real
Just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel

It makes me so angry
To know that the flame will always burn
I'll never get over
Know now that I'll never learn

Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home

Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home
