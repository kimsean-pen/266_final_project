Fearless on my final quest find truth beyond the flesh
Fleeting past my dreams of unfulfilled desire
My strength unwavering
My journey just beginning
A desperate race through the corridors of hell

Chaos emerges
Surrender I will not

The last enemy is falling
Here I am
To conquer death itself
The last enemy is falling
Here I stand
To conquer death itself

Funeral silence beneath the burning cross
My immortal soul sleeps with the wolves tonight
Skin and bones that rot
My blood runs dry
See me die to rise with the gods again

Chaos emerges
Surrender I will not

The last enemy is falling
Here I am
To conquer death itself
The last enemy is falling
Here I stand
To conquer death itself

Defy
Decay
Arise
Again

Chaos emerges
Surrender I will not (not, not, not)

The last enemy is falling
Here I am
To conquer death itself
The last enemy is falling
Here I stand
To conquer death itself
