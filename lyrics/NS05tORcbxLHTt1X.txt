Oh airborne eyes
Yeah, will see black storms
If the summer is gone
Let it slide by

So let's take tonight
Ooh my little one
If the captain is right
Then we shall be gone

Lost in the rhythm cause the rhythm is wild
Lost in the rhythm cause the prison is sad
Gonna need to reach her like the foot of the world
Where the Earth will end and the wild subside

Until she's gone

Oh hey, to be alive
Mmm, still need these bones
See the summer is yawning
Yeah, the crowd's gone in droves

So let's take tonight
Ooh dark little one
A strong stove in the past
Will keep our kettles warm

Lost in the rhythm cause the rhythm is wild
Lost in the rhythm cause the prison is wide
Gonna need to reach her like the foot of the world
Where her heart begins and the wild subside

Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until she's gone
(And on and on)
