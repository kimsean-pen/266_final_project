Maybe one day I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings

When we start saying things

Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more and so I guess some things are not meant to last

Is it too much to ask?

For tonight, let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight, pretend that it's all alright
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight, let's love like there's no goodbyes

No goodbyes, no goodbyes, no goodbyes, eh

In a dark room we don't have to
See the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate

Even though it's too late

For tonight, let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight, pretend that it's all alright
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight, let's love like there's no goodbyes

No goodbyes, no goodbyes, no goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes, no goodbyes, no goodbyes, eh

Maybe one day I'll see you, just smile and wave and be okay

For tonight, let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight, pretend that it's all alright
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight, let's love like there's no goodbyes

No goodbyes, no goodbyes, no goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes, no goodbyes, no goodbyes, eh
