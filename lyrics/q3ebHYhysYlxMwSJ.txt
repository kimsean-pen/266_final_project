It takes you in and tears it all out, it tears it all out
But you never know
It takes your life, turns you into someone
And you know it won't be long
Someone you'd never know

Don't claim that you know me
When you know very well
That I have seen through it all
And don't claim that you know why
When you know everything
When you've seen things for what they were
Yeah

Inside you feel it taking over
It's taking over
When you feel it most
It draws you in and tears it away
It tears it away
Then it leaves you lost

Don't claim that you know me
When you know very well
That I have seen through it all
And don't claim that you know why
When you know everything
When you've seen things for what they were
For what they were
Oh, oh
For what they were

Remember the days when our fears had long since died
And now how they age us
They've taken all our lives, lives

It takes you in and tears it all out, it tears it all out
But you never know
It takes your life, turns you into someone
And you know it won't be long
Someone you'd never know

Don't claim that you know me
When you know very well
That I have seen through it all
And don't claim that you know why
When you know everything
When you've seen things for what they are

Sore again is this old wound
It overshadows everything
And I have seen through it all

Ah, ah
Yeah
All the things I've seen
