And you when feel us
Your house is caving in
I took a ride to anywhere
And I can tell you
Just like your daddy does
I know it sounds like giving up
Yeah, with the silk piece swimming around
I'm giving you the truth
I'll go where the weather is telling me to go
I'm an arrow chief, I had to take me back
But when he knocks me kitchen down
I'll go where the weather is telling me to go
Nothing I can say, we're animals
We're animals
Wish I could fake it
Just like your daddy does
Go ahead and say it
You fucked up, little so and so
Until the place that you can know
And I've been in anxiety
And complicated energy
Suicide, too good for me
I know, I know and he's not asking me
I know, I know and he's not after me
You're animals, you're animals
And you when feel us
Your house is caving in
I took a ride to anywhere
And I can tell you
Just like your daddy does
I know it sounds like giving up
Yeah, with the silk piece swimming around
I'm giving you the truth
I'll go where the weather is telling me to go
I'm an arrow chief, I had to take me back
You're animals, you're animals
But when he knocks me kitchen down
I'm giving you the truth
I'll go where the weather is telling me to go
Nothing I can say, we're animals
We're animals
You're animals, you're animals
You're animals, you're animals
