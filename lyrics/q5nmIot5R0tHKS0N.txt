I, I can't lie
I'm scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothing at all?
Nothing at all
What is the point of my lips
If they don't make noise? Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all?
Watching it fall

The flicker burning
You know the time's running, running out
Only I see all the diamonds, diamonds
Breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning low

This is not a, this is not a
Swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a
Swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a
Swan song, swan song
Swan dive (Yeah)
It's a new life

Real fantasy
Wishing it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doing nothing at all?
Watching it fall

The flicker burning
You know the time's running, running out
Only I see all the diamonds, diamonds
Breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning low

This is not a, this is not a
Swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a
Swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a
Swan song, swan song
Swan dive (Yeah)
It's a new life

Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily
Treadâ€”

This is not a, this is not a
Swan (Tread heavily), swan song (Tread)
This is not a, this is not a
Swan (Tread heavily), swan song (Tread)
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight (Tread heavily)
This is not a, this is not a
Swan song, swan song
Swan dive (Yeah)
It's a new life

It's a new life
