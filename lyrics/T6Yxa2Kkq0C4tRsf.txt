I want to climb on your shadow
I want to use pseudonyms
You say the way and I'll follow
I won't try to escape

And I don't know why on earth i'm calling,
Calling at this time of night
You've got me hoping for some happenstance baby
You've got me uptight

I don't who you are
All i know is you fold me in half

I want the slope of your sorrow
I love the curve of your neck
I want the fuse to your morals
I want the keys to your chest

I don't who you are
All I know is I'm caught up on you
I'm caught up on you
I'm caught up on you
I'm caught up on you
