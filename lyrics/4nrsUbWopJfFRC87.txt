When it's strange days
Sometimes there's no going back
Days when it seems
You're on your own, there's no one else
Distant eyes dream
Strangers from another place
Circling around
To be left without a trace
Good side slips down
Walls closing all around
What's wrong? You said
I shrugged and shook my head
I know, I know, I know
Well I know, I know, I know
When it's strange days
Sometimes there's no going back
Days when it seems
You're on your own there's no one else
Nowhere to turn
When you thought this way would be
Familiar time
Is now a slow eternity
Walked in and found
Me staring at the ground
What's wrong? You said
I shrugged and shook my head
I know, I know, I know
Well I know, I know, I know
And I've been waiting for a while, strangers smile
And I wait here for a while, strangers smile
And I wait here for a while, strangers smile
And I wait here for a while, strangers smile
