I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive and ambition
The zeal I feel, this is my time

The note I wrote as she read
She said, "Has the perrier gone
Straight to my head
Or is life sick and cruel, instead?"

Yes
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no

I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive and the dreams inside
This is my time

Life tends to come and go
That's okay as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
As long as you know
Know, know, know, know, know
Know, know, know, know

I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive and the dreams inside
This is my time

I want the freedom and I want the guile
I want the freedom and the guile
Oh, life tends to come and go
As long as you know
Know, know, know, know
Know, know, know, know

I won't share you
I won't share you
I'll see you somewhere
I'll see you sometime, darling
