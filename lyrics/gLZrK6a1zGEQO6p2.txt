It never seemed that close to me
No it never seemed all that much to see
But now it feels so real
feels so real to me
But now it feels so much
Feels so much to see

Is this the,
The first time
I've seen the color of this room?
Is this the,
The first time?

Yes, I had a taste but I did not swallow
And if I went it was just to follow
And now a question was asked of me
But now there's a question being asked of me

Is this the,
The first time
I've seen the size of these walls?
Is this the,
The first time?
Yes.

Now
I'm the angry son
Everything I've learned was wrong
I'm the burning door
Once I'm opened I can't be closed
I found a hidden wheel
And it rolls to reveal that
I'm the angry son
I'm the angry son
