You were my drug, now I'm withdrawing
When you're in my blood, nothing's ever boring
I feel it through my veins, so eager to please
You give me chest pains, and let my heart rate ease
Is this blood on my hands or is it just red wine?
I find I'm thinking 'bout you nearly all of the night
I make up these excuses for the reasons we should meet
Is this an addiction or is this just a repeat?

I haven't been taking care of myself
I've forgotten what it's like to be in good health
I've gained weight and I drink too much
Maybe that's why you don't love me as much
I need to start taking care of myself

Distracting me from what's important
But you don't care, and I'm losing focus
You push me to the edge, and then you pull me back
I swear to God, I'll have a heart attack
My skin's breaking out and I don't like what I see
When I walk past shiny surfaces, I don't like being me
You say that you want me but you don't act like you do
I'm pretty sure my mum said be careful around you

I haven't been taking care of myself
I've forgotten what it's like to be in good health
I've gained weight and I drink too much
Maybe that's why you don't love me as much
I need to start taking care of myself

I don't care that all my clothes
Smell like your second-hand smoke
I'll make any compromise
If it keeps you by my side
I don't know why

I haven't been taking care of myself
I've forgotten what it's like to be in good health
I've gained weight and I drink too much
Maybe that's why you don't love me as much
I need to start taking care of myself

Do da da, do da da
Do da da do wah-oh!
Do da da, do da da
Do da da do wah-oh!
Do da da, do da da
Do da da do wah-oh!
Do da da, do da da
Do da da do wah-oh!
