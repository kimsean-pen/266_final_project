This scene is dulling and rotting.
Enemies, they start surrounding me,
Mostly in my head cause I swear,
I've never been so depressed.

I can't stand anyone here.
Now I'm thinking, "Let's just disappear!"
And we'll roll the dice,
On a beach-front tropical paradise.

I'm ready to go where palm trees always blow.
I'm sick of this crowd,
We are getting out!

I wanna go where there's no one we know,
Where stars glitter like a 70's disco.
Come on, come on...
I say "Let's get outta here!"
We're gonna go where we have no worries,
Wet beaches and dry martinis.
Come on, come on...
Let's get outta here!
Let's get outta here!

Maybe I'm going crazy.
The mainstream never made any sense to me.
Always on the outside looking in,
But I swear never fitting in.

They say we'll never make it.
Truth is I couldn't care any less.
I think delusion of grandeur are the only gifts I've ever had.

We are getting out!

I wanna go where there's no one we know,
Where stars glitter like a 70's disco.
Come on, come on...
I say "Let's get outta here!"
We're gonna go where we have no worries,
Wet beaches and dry martinis.
Come on, come on...
Let's get outta here!
Let's get outta here!

I'm ready to go where palm trees always blow
I'm sick of this crowd,
We are getting out!

I wanna go where there's no one here we know,
Where stars glitter like a 70's disco.
Come on, come on...
I say "Let's get outta here!"
We're gonna go where we have no worries,
Wet beaches and dry martinis.
Come on, come on...
I say "Let's get outta here!"
We're gonna go where we live out loud,
You know we're sick of this crowd.
Come on, come on...
Let's get outta here!
Let's get outta here!
Let's get outta here!
