Are you still here
? rushes on
And you think it's wrong
They're only in your head
Things you create
Just the empty shells
Of? yesterdays

So you never breathe a word
Selfish (?) with yourself
Until you break in two
? all you want to do
Until your dreams come true

Drugged sensibilities
Sketches I have made
?
?
?
? all you want to do
Until your dreams come true
