The weekend comes around
The gang is back in town
We love Saturdays
We love Saturdays

Another drink to slam
The Girls Wham Bang
The Band starts to play
The Band starts to play

That road fever
Never leaves me cold
You son of a gun
You never let me go

(All for one)
Standing tall through high and low
(All for one)
We ride the storm where it may blow
(All for one)
And one for all
And one for all

A California jam
Meet some good old friends
The city never sleeps
The city never sleeps

And when we hit the road
Watch out for trouble, Bro
Don't mess with rattlesnakes
Don't mess with rattlesnakes

That road fever
Hits me and I guess
I won't stop
'Till they'll Iay my bones to rest

(All for one)
Standing tall through high and low
(All for one)
We ride the storm where it may blow
(All for one)
And one for all
And one for all

Once I did only care about myself
Once I was lost and lonely
Road can be heaven, road can be hell
So if you want me, call me

That road fever
Never leaves me cold
You son of a gun
You never Iet me go

(All for one)
Standing tall through high and low
(All for one)
We ride the storm where it may blow
(All for one)
Just down the road, go, go, go
(All for one)
Always fast and never slow
All for one
And one for all
And one for all

All for one and one for all
Yeah!
