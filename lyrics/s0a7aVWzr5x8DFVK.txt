Time's up
Now watch me self destruct
Lights out, the room starts shaking
I can't take it, I can't take it
Fire and flood, that's it, I'm giving up
Cause I can't do anything but watch as it all falls...

Down I'm drowning lost again
Is this the end?

Oh god, cue the sirens
I'm gone, sound the alarm
I need this like a city in need of a wrecking ball
Cut! Scene!
Don't die like me

Turn and run before it comes undone
Caught in the act of relapsing
I'm on the tracks, collapsing

Down I'm drowning lost again
Is this the end?
Is this the end?!

Oh god, cue the sirens
I'm gone, sound the alarm
I need this like a city in need of a wrecking ball
Cut! Scene!
Don't die like...
Don't die like me

there could be blood this thin
I put my fist through the face in the glass

(Every mirror is just another seven years)

Last looks
There is no end to the story
No credits to roll
I'm killing off the lead in a one man show
Now watch me self destruct

Oh god, cue the sirens
I'm gone, sound the alarm
I need this like a city in need of a wrecking ball
Cut! Scene!
Don't die like...
Don't die like me
Don't die like me
