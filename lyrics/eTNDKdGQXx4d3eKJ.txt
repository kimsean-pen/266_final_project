I don't know what I hold in my hand, could it be that I'm evil?
Plunder on, there's no law in this land, the horror guides me through.
Masterer and subjector of pain, I'm the god of the worms.
Devil's legion controls the insane, you'll see it when I'm through.

I'll hang you higher than before.
I'll leave you dying at death's door.

Overruller and slaver of blood, she's impaled in the fire.
Fear of God drags her name through the mud, and now her life's cut short.
Dominator and firmer of sins, I'm the lord of the wastelands.
Bloody hammers and burning hot pins, her story shall be told.

I'll hang you higher than before.
I'll leave you lying at death's door.

I'm the juster and steerer of good, as they lace my hand with gold.
I'll stand guard as she's nailed to the wood, no truer man than me.
I'm the king and tormentor of all, as I travel the cities.
Broken peasants and mayors shall call, my bloodlust never ends.

I'll hang you higher than before.
I'll leave you lying at death's door.
