Right now, it feels like it's the encore
Like we just lived through one more
We just set foot in the door

I know, you think you've seen the whole show
But this is just the intro
It's not goodbye, it's hello, here we go

The night is young
And we're just getting started
We're just getting started
And the best is yet to come
And we're just getting started now

Whoa, whoa, oh oh whoa
And we're just getting started now
Whoa, whoa, oh oh whoa
And we're just getting started now

Right now, it feels like it's the last page
But we're just warming up the stage
I've found the key, unlocked the cage

I know, it's feeling like the sunrise
But it isn't even midnight
Oh girl we got a lot of time, lot of time
I'll make you mine, oh

The night is young
And we're just getting started
We're just getting started
And the best is yet to come
And we're just getting started now
Whoa, whoa, oh oh whoa
And we're just getting started now
(Time to set it off, so let's begin)
Whoa, whoa, oh oh whoa
And we're just getting started now

And we're just getting started now
I, I, I know that I just met ya
Feels like it's been forever

But it's only getting better, and better, and better, and oh oh

The night is young
And we're just getting started
We're just getting started
And the best is yet to come
And we're just getting started now

Whoa, whoa, oh oh whoa
And we're just getting started now
(Time to set it off, so let's begin)
Whoa, whoa, oh oh whoa
And we're just getting started now
Whoa, whoa, oh oh whoa
And we're just getting started now
Whoa, whoa, oh oh whoa
And we're just getting started now
