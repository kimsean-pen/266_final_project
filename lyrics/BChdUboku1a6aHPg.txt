blue jeans, white shirt
walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn
it was like James Dean, for sure
you're so fresh to death and sick as c-cancer
you were sort of punk rock
I grew up on hip hop
but you fit me better than my favorite sweater
and I know that love is mean

and love hurts
but I still remember that day we met in December
oh baby
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
promise you'll remember that you're mine

baby, can you see through the tears?

love you more than those bitches before
say you'll remember, say you'll remember oh baby
I will love you 'til the end of time
big dreams
gangsta'
said you had to leave to start your life over

I was like, "No please, stay here
we don't need no money, we can make it all work."

But he headed out on Sunday
said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing but he was
chasing paper

caught up in the game, it was the last I heard
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years

promise you'll remember that you're mine
baby, can you see through the tears?
love you more than those bitches before
say you'll remember
say you'll remember, oh baby ooh
I will love you 'til the end of time
you went out every night,
but baby, that's alright

I told you that no matter what
you did I'd be by your side
'cause I'm a ride or die
whether you fail or fly

well shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out the door
a piece of me died
told you I wanted more
that's not what I had in mind
Just want it like before
we were dancing all night
then they took you away
stole you out of my life
you just need to remember
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
promise you'll remember that you're mine
baby, can you see through the tears?
love you more than those bitches before
say you'll remember
say you'll remember, oh baby, ooh
I will love you 'til the end of time
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
promise you'll remember that you're mine
oh oh, oh oh
oh oh, oh oh
oh oh, oh oh
