Summer swallowed us whole,
Waited for you to come around.

Every word you wrote
Down, we read it over to know...
Would they believe in us now?

There's no shame like no
Sound from sources hits close to home.
Everything that we've found
Says make your own destiny. But

You're unaware that you
Should be scared.
Maybe you'll learn from mistakes that we make.
We're not waiting forever.

We know you'll never be there.
We're not waiting forever,
If you get out
See you there.

You're not awake
As I'm aware.
Woo

Maybe we had all you
Figured absolutely wrong.
There's been a misunderstanding
We've had all along.

Maybe we had all you
Figured absolutely wrong.
(Maybe we had all you
Figured absolutely wrong.)
You can read about
(You can read)
About it when we're gone.
