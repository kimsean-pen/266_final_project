Never wanna stand up for myself
Never wanna get in the way, I said it
I don't know what the plan is
But you can share with me, 'cause I'll
Be listening here
To everything you say, I won't turn away
And I will listen, open up my heart and
I must say that I love you, so

Oo la love, I've fallen in love
and it's better this time than ever before
Oo la love, I've fallen in love
and it's better this time than I've ever known

Every day is a battle i face
Strange life i live but its what you've decided
I'll give it all into your hands
Do what you will with me, and oh
I'll smile when you speak
Remember all those times I was hoping for something
And shaking my head from all I have done
But you never left me

Oo la love, I've fallen in love
and it's better this time than ever before
Oo la love, I've fallen in love
and it's better this time than I've ever known
Oo la love, I've fallen in love
and it's better this time than ever before
Oo la love, I've fallen in love
and it's better this time than I've ever known

Give it up for you, I would give it up for you
I would give it up for you, I'd do anything for you

Oo la love, I've fallen in love
and it's better this time than ever before
Oo la love, I've fallen in love
and it's better this time than I've ever known
Oo la love, I've fallen in love
and it's better this time than ever before
Oo la love, I've fallen in love
and it's better this time than I've ever known
I have fallen in love
I have fallen in love
