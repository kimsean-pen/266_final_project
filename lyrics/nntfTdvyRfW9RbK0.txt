Drive away,
As in lonesome south
Like a real straight-shooter
Three lanes full

Drive away,
As in lonesome south
Like a real straight-shooter
Three lanes full

Gotta ride in my heart
Get em going down,
You don't have to be a star,

To, to get them going round
Even if you try to move,
Wheel it to your right,
So get on, on the driving wheel,

To- save it for a round

Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly, billy man

Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly, billy man
Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly, billy man
Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly, billy man
Got to ride in my heart,

See 'em goin' down
Killed up by the ball front,
Shoot a jamboree,
cold lighted day,
Like a memory,
Just a cold lighted day,
Slip a line on me

Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly, billy man
Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly, billy man
Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly, billy man
Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly, billy man
Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly, billy man
Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly, billy man
Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly, billy man
Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly, billy man
