I see a life misled
Oh I lost inside your head
How I want to be your sin
When you're undone

You're ignited like a firework
Set to explode

Give up, give up, help
A stranger to yourself
You are pushed, to you push back
And come undone

You're ignited like a firework
Set to explode
You're ignited like a firework
You're in a lie, that you've never known

You're ignited like a firework
Set to explode
You're ignited like a firework
You're in a lie, that you've never known
You're in a lie, that you've never known
You're in a lie, that you've never known
