Self medicating, craving punishment
Blaming myself for a world on fire
No more shame, no more pity
No more
We rise from the ashes

I will suffer
I will burn
Let hate prevail
Enslave my soul
But I'll never surrender

Silent words from a bleeding mouth
Swallows pride with a swollen tongue
Everything is nothing, life in a shallow grave
Too ashamed to feel joy life collecting dust
No more shame, no more pity
No more
We rise from the ashes

I will suffer
I will burn
Let hate prevail
Enslave my soul
but I'll never surrender

I will suffer
I will burn
Let hate prevail
Enslave my soul
but I'll never surrender

Mental cancer hijacks your brain
Denying the reality you created for yourself
We rise from the ashes

We rise from the ashes!!!
I will suffer
I will burn
Let hate prevail
Enslave my soul

but I'll never surrender
I will suffer
I will burn
Let hate prevail
Enslave my soul

but I'll never surrender
Never surrender
Never surrender
Never surrender
Never surrender
Never surrender
Never surrender
Never surrender
Never surrender
Never surrender
