I was alone
On my way home
My footsteps slow
Someone walks close behind me

I lose my breath
By hands of death
He hit my head
This body's fallen lifeless

Carry my through
To somewhere new
Why am I here
I do not know these people

I'm calling home
Let it be known
I'm with a friend
I'm not in any danger

44 days I have been held here
I will never see the light of day
Please save me from reckless, violent hearts
Bodies rest in graves of cold concrete

They woke me up
Pain in my gut
With several cuts
These boys are mindless demons

I'm losing blood
The fear they lust
Memories are dust
No one can hear me crying

This lonely room
I call my tomb
A falling moon
How will they choose to end me

Before my eyes
A fire lights
My body dies
Hell will engulf me slowly

44 days I have been held here
I will never see the light of day
Please save me from reckless, violent hearts
Bodies rest in graves of cold concrete

44 days I have been held here
I will never see the light of day
Please save me from reckless, violent hearts
Bodies rest in graves of cold concrete

44 days I have been held here
I will never see the light of day
Please save me from reckless, violent hearts
Bodies rest in graves of cold concrete
