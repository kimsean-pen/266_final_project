In a world of joy
A light will fall on the hearts of all mankind
So full of love but not for me
From atop the cross
Poison flowed from Christ
Now I wake up numb
In a world of joy
I will not weep
For the dark has come and fear has passed
I surrender
There's no place for me a in a world of joy
I will not weep
In a world of joy I will dance on my own grave
