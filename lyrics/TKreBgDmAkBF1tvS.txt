I don't know what your looking for
You haven't found it baby, that's for sure
You rip me up and spread me all around
In the dust of the dead of time
And this is not a case of lust, you see
It's not a matter of you versus me
It's fine the way you want me on your own
But in the end it's always me alone

And I'm losing my favorite game
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby
Losing my favorite game

I only know what I've been working for
Another you so I could love you more
I really thought that I could take you there
But my experiment is not getting us anywhere

I had a vision I could turn you right
A stupid mission and a legal fight

I should have seen it when my hope was new
My heart is black and my body is blue
And I'm losing my favorite game
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my favorite game
You're losing your mind again

I'm losing my baby
Losing my favorite game
I'm losing my favorite game
You're losing your mind again
I've tried
I've tried
But you're still the same
I'm losing my baby
You're losing a savior and a saint
