Speak to me softly now,
I swear you'll never live this down
We move so slowly now
Now that you know your sin is out
Lust so carelessly
But were you ever free
Temptation's lost its way
No longer I'm astry
If you can't hold out
Then keep your volume down
Speak to me softly now,
I swear you'll never live this down
We move so slowly now
Now that you know your sin is out
Give me your all
Stares pierce your skin
And society won't be forgiving
of you this time
From time to time
You will learn just how to regret
who you let inside
So keep your volume down
Speak to me softly now,
I swear you'll never live this down
We move so slowly now
Now that you know your sin is out
Your sin is out
Lust so carelessly
But were you ever free
Temptation's lost its way
No longer I'm astray
Speak to me softly now,
I swear you'll never live this down
We move so slowly now
Now that you know your sin is out
Your sin is out
Is out
