Dark distant remarks are calling
To remind me what we are
Dim romantic sparks, we all fall down

So we can all cover our eyes
From explosions in the skies
Can you feel them burning?
Can't you feel the earth tilt?

Can you feel my heartbeat?
Pounding into nothing
Broken bones are floating
in my empty body
Can you feel it reaching?
Moving through the feeling
Won't you bring me down?
Won't you bring me down to size

Dark distant remarks are calling
To remind me what we are
Something I can't handle most of the time
And I know it's a surprise
How tall I stand sometimes
But I've written my goodbye on a folded napkin
Slipped inside your pocket
Before you left me standing
I knew you weren't listening

Can you feel my HEARTBEAT?
Pounding into nothing
Broken bones are floating in my empty body
Can you feel it reaching?
Moving through the feeling
Won't you bring me down?
Won't you bring me down to size
