Heartless princess
Effortless
You got a touch in your hand
Second guess
I guess I'm complex
So thoughtless
It's what you do to me

Scream until I'm blue
Yeah I'm losing my edge
Then she's air in my chest
What ya got in your hand?

Drag my feet to bed
While you're living your best
Now I'm kind of a mess
It's what you do to me
(It's what you do to me)

You can try to simplify romance
Reduce it to a touch
But maybe we're in love
You can try to simplify romance
Call it odd attraction
Pulling like a magnet
(You can try)

Black and white
Rainbow
It's chemical
What you do to me

Scream until I'm blue
Yeah I'm losing my edge
Then she's air in my chest
Breathing life in

Drag my feet to bed
While you're living your best
Now I'm kind of a mess
It's what you do to me
(It's what you do to me)

You can try to simplify romance
Reduce it to a touch
But maybe we're in love
You can try to simplify romance
Call it odd attraction
Pulling like a magnet
(You can try)

Simplify
It's no mystery
You're so stuck in my mind
It's what you do to me
It's what you do to me
It's what you do to me
Simplify romance
It's what you do to me

The more we speak the less we say
Just searching for a friendly face
In love with what we wanna hate
(It's what you do to me)
In love with what we wanna hate

You can try to simplify romance
Reduce it to a touch
But maybe we're in love
You can try to simplify romance
Call it odd attraction
Pulling like a magnet

Simplify
It's no mystery
You're so stuck in my mind
It's what you do to me
It's what you do to me
It's what you do to me
Simplify romance
Look what you do to me
