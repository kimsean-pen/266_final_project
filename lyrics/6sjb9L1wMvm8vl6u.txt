Last call on the boulevard
City of love and broken hearts
Crazy, beautiful, bizarre
Three words everything you are
If you wanna light my cigarette
I might let you have a hit
I'm not into playing hard to get
We can have a night we won't forget

You are the perfect stranger
(Never saw you coming. Never saw you coming.)
I need some bad behaviour
(Wasn't this for loving. Wasn't this for loving.)

Out of the blue
There was you
Out of the blue
Just us two
Lalalalala
Lalalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalalala

Come in, don't turn off the lights
You're my toy just for the night
You can make me feel alive
So wrong, but it feels so right
Pick a name I won't remember it
It's a shame but you'll get over it
Gotta catch my flight at ten to six
Never say goodbye to just a fix

You are the perfect stranger
(Never saw you coming. Never saw you coming.)
I need some bad behaviour
(Wasn't this for loving. Wasn't this for loving.)

Out of the blue
There was you
Out of the blue
Just us two
Lalalalala
Lalalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalalala

All I see is blue
All I want is you
All I see is blue
All I want is you
All I see is blue
Baby, all I want is you
All I see is blue
All I want is you

Out of the blue
There was you, there was you
There was you
There was you, there was you

Out of the blue
There was you
Out of the blue
Just us two
Lalalalala
Lalalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalalala
