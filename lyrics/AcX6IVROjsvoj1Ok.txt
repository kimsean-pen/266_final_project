Smoke in my lungs, liquor in my veins
Fear in my eyes, panic in the way
(I don't think I'll make it out, make it through the day)
Clench my teeth and close my eyes
Just make this go away

Oh it's tearing me apart, all this pain inside
Liquor in my veins, panic on my mind
Tearing me apart, all this pain inside
Searching for the peace I will never find

Oh it's tearing me apart
Tearing me apart

I've got these chains around my feet
And they're dragging me to hell
The embers set my chest alight
A feeling I know all too well
(I'm in the mouth of the wolf now,
I can hear the words they say)
But I'm feeling oh so far
I feel so far away

Oh it's tearing me apart, all this pain inside
Liquor in my veins, panic on my mind
Tearing me apart, all this pain inside
Searching for the peace I will never find

The panic's stealing all my breath
Death is calling out my name
He knows I'm not afraid of dying
He knows to me it's all the same
But there is so much on the line
I have to find a better way
I have to find my own redemption
Fight the urge to drift away

I have to hold you in my heart
So I can live another day

Oh it's tearing me apart, all this pain inside
Liquor in my veins, panic on my mind
Tearing me apart, all this pain inside
Searching for the peace I will never find

Tearing me apart, oh it's tearing me apart
