If you should be
The last autumn leaf
Haning from the tree

I'll still be here
Waiting on the breeze
To bring you down to me

And if it takes forever,
Forever it'll be.
And if it takes forever,
Forever it'll be.

If you should be
The last seed in spring
To venture out a leaf

I'll still be here
Waiting on the rain
To warm your heart for me

And if it takes forever,
Forever it'll be.
And if it takes forever,
Forever it'll be.
