I'm living with "I told you so"
And these feelings get a little bit old
On the cusp of getting it right
But it never is black and white, and white, no

She gave me the time when shit got rough
A little more time could've been enough for us

"Do more"
She says to me on the carpet floor
Stretch yourself thin
So I can be with you once again
Before I have to run
And leave these bars of one

I'm reaching for what I can't see
But the quiet still gets to me
I swallow, had I known it's worth
Love seldom and that's why it hurts

She gave me the time when shit got rough
A little more time could've been enough for us

"Do more"
She says to me on the carpet floor
Stretch yourself thin
So I can be with you once again
Before I have to run
And leave these bars of one

She gave me the time when shit got rough
A little more time could've been enough
I ran out of time and lost my luck
A little more time could've been enough for us

"Do more"
She says to me on the carpet floor
Stretch yourself thin
So I can be with you once again
Before I have to run
And leave these bars of one
Before I have to run
And leave these bars of one

I said it's not even
You ended up just leaving
Me and your feelings
Lying on the carpet floor
It's not that even
You ended up just leaving
Me and your feelings
Lying on the carpet floor
