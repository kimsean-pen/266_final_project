Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from another world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away

We sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever
She left my heart on the other side, all to break it into bits
Her smile was a winter song, a Sabbath ending
Don't sleep or you'll find me gone, just an image in the air

In dreams I think of you
I don't know what to do with myself
Time has let me down
She brings broken dreams, fallen stars
The endless search for where you are
Sail on, sail on
Sail on, sail on

I fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, unholy lady
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away

Don't sail away on the crimson tide
Don't leave your heart on the other side
Her eyes are an endless flame
Desire with a special name

Don't ever fall in love
Don't give your heart away
No, never, never fall in love
With a country girl
