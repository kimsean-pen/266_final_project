He said I've been where you've been before
Down every hallway's a slammin' door
No way out, no one to come and save me
Wastin' a life that the Good Lord gave you
Then somebody said what I'm sayin' to you

Open my eyes and told me the truth
He said: just a little faith and it'll all get better
So I followed that preacher man down to the river
And now I'm changed
And now I'm stronger

There must've been somethin' in the water
Oh there must've been somethin' in the water
Well I heard what he said and I went on my way
Didn't think about it for a couple of days
Then it hit me like a lightnin' late one night

I was all out of hope, and all out of fight
Couldn't fight back my tears so I fell on my knees
Sayin' God if you're there come and rescue me
Felt all pourin' down from above
Got washed in the water, washed in the blood

And now I'm changed
And now I'm stronger
There must be somethin' in the water
Oh there must be somethin' in the water

And now I'm singin: all along to Amazin' Grace
Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
Thinkin' about it, I saw the heart gonna look ahead
No turnin' back, man everyday, give it all that I have

Trusted someone bigger than me
Ever since the day that I believed I am changed
And now I'm stronger
There must be been somethin' in the water

Oh there must be somethin' in the water
Oh there must be somethin' in the water
Oh there must be somethin' in the water
Oh yeah. I am stronger, stronger
There now I see
