And he's half in love with Elizabeth
And he's half in love with you

Some things are too painful to say out loud
Well, they live behind a veil and see through a shroud
Words fly through his mouth
Like paper butterflies
Well they flutter around and put holes in your side

And he's half in love with Elizabeth
And he's half in love with you

I knew that you were thinking of him last night
'Cos I saw the blood seep down to your toes
Yes, hideaway if you must
But how can you put your trust
In a man who always sleeps in his clothes?

And he's half in love with Elizabeth
And he's half in love with you
Yes he's half in love with Elizabeth
And he's half in love with you

You're the sweet scent on an envelope
Or the photo in it's book
But if you pin your hopes to his back my dear
I'm afraid the bubble will burst

The bubble will burst
The bubble will burst
The bubble will burst
The bubble will burst
The bubble will burst
The bubble will burst
The bubble will burst

And he's half in love with Elizabeth
And he's half in love with you
And he's half in love with Elizabeth
And he's half in love with you
Yes he's half in love with Elizabeth
And he's half in love with you
