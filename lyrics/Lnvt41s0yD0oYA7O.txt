I pick up by the handful
the somber heap at my feet
eyes closed to see the hopeful
trusting my deepest instinct
I pick up by the handful
the somber heap at my feet
eyes closed to see the hopeful
trusting my deepest instinct
But i go on,
dawning light,
task of hope
?
dawning light,
task of hope
?
At last dare to raise my eyes,
i saw the ship in the stars
strong of glittering fleet,
bringing light to the new born
I pick up by the handful
the somber heap at my feet
eyes closed to see the hopeful
trusting my deepest instinct
At last dare to raise my eyes,
i saw the ship in the stars
strong of glittering fleet,
bringing light to the new born
In a dawn light,
task of hope,
these are stars
