Ichi, ni
Ichi, ni, san, shi

I'll take you under
One way or another
No chance in hell, so why even bother?
What you wanted
What you needed
To take it all is to lie here, bleeding

I'll feed you now, cow
But you say it slow
Wanna change it, now
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I told you so, so
Not the fact, the grow
Shoulda' said: no
But it's too late

In one
Way
In one way or another
I
Will
I'll fuckin' drag you under
One
Way
In one way or another
I
Will
I'll fuckin' drag you under

I'm bruised and battered
I'll leave you shattered
I'll make you trust me as I sharpen my dagger
Tetanus city
I only hid it
So watch me fall, incapacitated

Can't miss me no more
Like all the times I snore
I'm walking out the door
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
We're in a state of war
Well, I just have to score
I don't care anymore
'Cause it's too late

In one
Way
In one way or another
I
Will
I'll fuckin' drag you under
One
Way
In one way or another
I
Will
I'll fuckin' drag you under

So sick of lying, always fighting
You say I'm always getting drunk
Grow bigger, hail the high and mighty
Like a pig, you always leave me stuck

In one
Way
In one way or another
I
Will
I'll fuckin' drag you under

In one
Way
In one way or another
I
Will
I'll fuckin' drag you under
One
Way
In one way or another
I
Will
I'll fuckin' drag you under
