I had a talk with the shadow and the light
Oh-huh, fighting for me
They said put your tricks aside
(And for once believe)
How can I, I don't
I never did, I don't know how to
But when it's not enough to fight for me
I'm gonna wanna live and fight for you

Just because it's black in the dark
Doesn't mean there's no color
Just because it's black in the dark
Doesn't mean there's no color

Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color (Doesn't mean there's no color)
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color

I had a talk with the shadow and the light
Oh, oh, looking at me
They said put your reason aside
And for once believe
How can I, I don't
I never did, I don't know how to
And if I ever stop believing in me
I know I always can believe in you

Just because it's black in the dark
Doesn't mean there's no color
Just because it's black in the dark
Doesn't mean there's no color

Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color (Doesn't mean there's no color)
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color (Doesn't mean there's no color)

I pulled up my roots
From the bottom I was caught in
I was caught in
And I had a talk with the shadow and the light
Fighting for me

Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color (Doesn't mean there's no color)
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
Oh-he-oh-he, color
