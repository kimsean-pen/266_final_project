I thought I saw you so many times
Heard I'd gone out of my mind
You wore a raincoat, selected style
You calmed a baby that cried

And I know you would be cool if I got arrested
I would wake up in a room you had renovated

But it's easy to hide
You can go where you like
When you've left someone's mind

I thought I saw you so many times
Said I was sure every sight
You wore a girl's hands over your eyes
You made the boredom seem right

And I know you would be kind
If I'd run into you
I'd act happy you'd act sad
Like a winner has to

But it's easy to hide
You can go where you like
When you no longer count

I thought I saw you so many times
Thought I'd gone out of my mind
Your face confuses my sense of time
Like any star in the sky

And I know you're gonna feel proud
That I am still dreaming
And I know I'm gonna pretend
You deserve to feel that way

Cause it's easy to lie
When you act sane for once
You can be who you like
