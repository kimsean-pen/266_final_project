Her daddy got a big aeroplane,
Her mommy holds all the family cash,
A beautiful blows, I stay at the corner,
She is living in and out of tune.

Hey you,
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin C.
Hey you,
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin C,
Your vitamin C.

And at Christmas riding on her pony
Or she is stepping on the pigman's head,
A beautiful blows, I stay at the corner,
She is living in and out of tune.

Hey you,
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin C.
Hey you,
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin C,
Your vitamin C.

Hey you,
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin C.
Hey you,
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin C.
