I called it perfectly
I'll never be content with myself
classically me
I called it perfectly
I think you fit
fit right next to me
so please stay

tired and fading
am I still the same person you used to know?
'cause it never feels the same
holding on to something that isn't you

violent and empty
I'll never understand me like you do
I'm moving through so blindly
can't paint the colors that you're so used to

I just wanted to
promise you some type of forever
in wake of just watching you
walk away
and oh my god
the things I'd do
to keep you right next to me
I need you right next to me

day after day
I breathe in the feeling of withdrawal
until my lungs are filled
with the empty
space between us

so split my soul into two
and wear me out
thinner than you ever have before

I just wanted to
promise you some type of forever
in wake of just watching you
walk away
and oh my god
the things I'd do
to keep you right next to me
I need you right next to me
