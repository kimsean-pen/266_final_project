We could blame the world forever
we could just escape together.
So are we breaking out
or are we breaking down?

We can't blame this world forever.
(This world forever)
The end will never come
there's still a mountain left unclimbed.
But we will overcome
the hurdles placed inside our minds
So close but still so far

each day will bring us brand new scars

What are we fighting for?
we cannot live like this no more
'Cause in the thick of darkened days, We know.
We could blame the world forever

we could just escape together
So are we breaking out
or are we breaking down?
We cant blame this world forever
(This world forever)
Just need some clarity

can't seem to open up these eyes

Don't want your sympathy
it took me time to realise
(This is no oneside war)
or how we thought this life would be
(This is not what we need,)
so take this shit away from me
'Cause in the thick of darkened days, We know.
We could blame the world forever
we could just escape together
so are we breaking out
or are we breaking down?
we cant blame this world forever.
(Guitar solo)
(Whoa)
So are we breaking out?
(Whoa)
Or are we breaking down?
(Whoa)
I guess what's done is done.
(Whoa)
But we will overcome!
We could blame this world for(ever)
We could blame the world forever
we could just escape together.
So are we breaking out?
Or are we breaking down?
We can't blame this world forever.
'Cause in the thick of darkened days, We know.
