Do you remember a time
When we looked to the stars at night?
Do you remember our lives
Free from the poison, free from the lies?
Let me alter your surroundings
Step beyond all that you know
This could be the end of us
How far can our future go?

To live to feel the Earth in motion
I can see there's much hope in changing this world
But no one's listening
We've been living our lives so long in denial
Like whispers to the wind

Earthbound!
We are shackled to the same ground
Our hope! One chance!

Earthbound!
We are shackled to the same ground
Our hope! One chance!

This is a part of the future
I don't think I'm ready to lose yet
We must be better than we've ever shown
For your resolution
You should stand as you must
To bring life into a dying sun

To live to feel the Earth in motion
I can see there's much hope in changing this world
But no one's listening
We've been living our lives so long in denial
Like whispers to the wind

We were given one chance
To make this world our own
We were given one chance
To make this world our own
To let this become...

Desolation!
Of all we know!

Desolation of our own!

To live to feel the Earth in motion, is all I need
I can see there's much hope in changing this world
But no one's listening
We've been living our lives so long in denial
Like whispers to the wind

Earthbound!
We are shackled to the same ground
Our hope! One chance!

Earthbound!
We are shackled to the same ground
Our hope! One chance!
