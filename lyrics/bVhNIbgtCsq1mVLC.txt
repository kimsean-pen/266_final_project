Met you when we were flying kites
All our candles burning bright
Watching you my knuckles white
As we pour it up
Turning on your upbeat smile
You raise the world with your golden eyes
I just wanna stay
I just wanna stay in your light

There's nothing like it
On your love, I'm as high as fuck
Nothing like it
You're just passing on through
With your hula hoop
Nothing like it
Oh oh, on your love, I'm as high as fuck
Nothing like it
But you're just passing on through
With your hula hoop

I just wanna stay, just wanna stay in your light
My time I'd give it all to you
Pretend we're married, heart tattoos
Spilling jokers over you as we burn it up
I would be a dirty thief
And steal the diamonds from the richest queen
If you just stay
If you just stay in my arms

There's nothing like it
On your love, I'm as high as fuck
Nothing like it
You're just passing on through
With your hula hoop
Nothing like it
Oh oh, on your love, I'm as high as fuck
Nothing like it
But you're just passing on through
With your hula hoop
Nothing like it

(Spin around, spin around)
On your love, I'm as high as fuck
(Like the end is coming)
Nothing like it
(Spin around, spin around)
But you're just passing on through with your hula hoop
(Like the end is coming)
Nothing like it
(Spin around, spin around)
Oh oh, on your love, I'm as high as fuck
(Like the end is coming)
Nothing like it
(Spin around, spin around)
But you're just passing on through with your hula hoop
(Like the end is coming)
