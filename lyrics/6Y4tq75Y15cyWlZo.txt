Americans pills will wreck and deal
American pills will wreck and kill
Oh, men are reaping in a twitching hand
The 50-foot whole of addiction men
Do you, do you understand?

Let's break out these chains
Let's burn it down
Let's break out these chains
Let's burn it down
Let's break out these chains
Let's burn it down
Let's break out these chains
Let's burn it down

No no no, this shoving liberty
She wanted everything that he did not have
And If I keep writing everything I say
American pills will wreck and kill, yes they will

Break out these chains, let's burn it down
Let's break out these chains
Let's burn it down
Let's break out these chains
Let's burn it down
Let's break out these chains
Let's burn it down

Caged them on a with a witting hand
Caged them on a with a winning hand
People get caught on a needless spell
Oh, they keep buying everything they sell

Break out these chains, let's burn it down
Let's break out these chains
Let's burn it down
Let's break out these chains
Let's burn it down
Let's break out these chains
Let's burn it down
