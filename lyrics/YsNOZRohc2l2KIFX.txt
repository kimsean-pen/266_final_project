Caravan's lost
In the sun and the dust
No one loves you
When you are lost
Yeah I'm a clown
Pullin' my world down
I believed I was strong

you are the song
And when it comes
you'll feel the weight of it
the weight of it
And the day will come

when you'll get away from it
away from it

Sometimes everything is easy
Sometimes everything is easy
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la
I tried to quit
But my heart won't buy it
I got family
The caravan came back for me
And when it comes

you'll feel the weight of it
The weight of it
And the day will come
when you'll get away from it
Away from it
Sometimes everything is easy
Sometimes everything is easy
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
