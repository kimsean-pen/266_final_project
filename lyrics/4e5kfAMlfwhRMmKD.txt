Cousins of the antichrist are hiding everywhere
Watching as we let our guard down smiling as we eat their lies

Cousins of the antichrist we're feeding their ways
Light eyes and dark minds and feel nothing

(All went down
A long way
Found there love
All in vain
All went down
All insane
Found there love
All in vain)

Cousins of the antichrist don't look me in the eye
Dirty mind and crooked spine but heart is pure, heart is the lords

(All went down
A long way
Found there love
All in vain
All went down
All insane
Found there love
All in vain)
