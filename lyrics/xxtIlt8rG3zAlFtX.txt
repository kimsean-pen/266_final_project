Art i ficial

I know I'm artificial, but don't put the blame on me
I was reared with appliances in a consumer society

When I put on my make-up, the pretty little masks not me
'Cause that's the way a girl should be in a consumer society
In a, in a consumer society, in a, in a consumer society

Existence is elusive, the kind that is supported by mechanical resources
Existence is elusive, the kind that is supported by mechanical resources

I wanna be Instamatic, I wanna be a frozen pea
I wanna be dehydrated in a consumer society
In a, in a consumer society, in a, in a consumer society

Existence is elusive, the kind that is supported by mechanical resources
Existence is elusive, the kind that is supported by mechanical resources

In a, in a consumer society, in a, in a consumer society

I wanna be Instamatic, I wanna be a frozen pea
I wanna be dehydrated in a consumer society
In a, in a consumer society, in a, in a consumer society, in a, in a consumer society
