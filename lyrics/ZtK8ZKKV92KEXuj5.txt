Put it down then I pick it back up
Praying for your name to pop up
Telling me that you still in love, still in love with me
No matter how hard I hope
No matter how much I want
No matter how bad I'm broke
You still don't

Call, call, call, call me
You've taken all the time you need
If our love, if our love, if our love, means anything
Baby please call, call, call me

Can't sleep I'm scared to dream
I'm remembering everything
That you said, that you said to me
When I was yours and you were mine
and I didn't have to wait all night for you to

Call, call, call l, call me, you've taken all the tume you need
If our love, if our love, if our love, means anything
Baby please call, call, call, call me

Don't you miss me, din't you need me, don't you leave me this way
Aren't you lonely, don't you want me, how many times must I say

Call, call, call l, call me, you've taken all the tume you need
If our love, if our love, if our love, means anything
Baby please call, call, call, call me

Oh call, call, call, call me
If our love, if our love, if our love means anything
Baby please call, call, call, call me
