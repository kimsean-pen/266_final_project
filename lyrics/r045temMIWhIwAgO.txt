Every moment's
Like a step unknown
To finding both our function
We could burn out
Like our heroes' ghosts
But that's a chance worth taking
Leave all reason at the door
Coz the writing's on the wall
The sunshine's gone
Maybe it's too soon to call
But we've both been here before
So I'm waiting on

No our music it ain't done
Coz I found our revelry
On the highways, in the dancehalls
That filled our history
So can you hear me now?
Gonna tell you where I stand
There's got to be some way
To lift you from this place

I bend and break, break down
Should've known you better better by now
I bend and break, break down
I'm trying to say that we're caught up in the sound of this

I'm not losing in the danger zone
The city lights my thinking
I would stand and face down every blow
Coz your a chance worth taking
Leave all reason at the door
Coz the writing's on the wall
The sunshine's home
Maybe it's too soon to call
But we've both been here before
So I'm waiting on

I bend and break, break down
Should've known you better, better by now
I bend and break, break down
I'm trying to say that we're caught up in the sound of this

No our music it ain't done
Coz I found our revelry
On the highways, in the dancehalls
That filled our history
So can you hear me now?
Gonna tell you where I stand
There's got to be some way
To lift you from this place

I bend and break, break down
Should've known you better, better by now
I bend and break, break down
I'm trying to say that we're caught up in the sound of this

If we could turn all our fears into toys
We could start this again
If we could turn all our fears into toys
We could start this again

I'll bend and break
