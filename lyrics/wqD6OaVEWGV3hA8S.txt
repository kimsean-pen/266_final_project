We're in the ruins of dreams
Vultures and their dead-end screams
The fragile sanctuary of home
Spit me out, find another clone
Need a revolution
To find the lost evolution
Waiting for the wind to turn
Avoiding truth and never learn
Never learn, never learn, never learn

So burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes, let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes, let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes

Drop the bombs, build the new
Purge our thoughts for different views
Different mantra, different beat
Still heading for eternal sleep
Devoured by constant pressure
Always for someone else's pleasure
Not sure what you see in the scope
Afraid we're running out of hope
Out of hope, out of hope, out of hope

So burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes, let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes

In the name of a broken spirit
Fight the boundaries and kill it
Trapped inside the villain of man
Apathy, the sickness in our lifespan

So burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes, let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
So burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes, let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes
