We are alive for a moment
One second in the great abyss of time
All the bleeding, and all the hate just one blink of an eye
All the conflict, visits dire pain on human life
Are we missing what it is to be alive?

One by one the pieces fall
Until our pride defeats us all
Or we learn to live without it

Wake up to the sound of this time bomb
Wake up to its deafening song
Wake up 'cause you don't know what you've got until it's gone
Until it's gone

Our innocence is a virtue
But our arrogance will only leave us blind
Unattended without anyone to save our idle lives
Will we find out that everything we know exists inside
Of a fraction, of a fraction

And one by one the pieces fall again

Wake up to the sound of this time bomb
Wake up to its deafening song
Wake up 'cause you don't know what you've got until it's gone
Until it's gone
Wake up to the sound of this time bomb
Wake up to its deafening song
Wake up 'cause you don't know what you've got until it's gone
Until it's gone away

One by one the pieces fall
Until our pride defeats us all

One by one the pieces fall (one by one the pieces fall)
Until our pride defeats us all

Wake up to the sound of this time bomb
Wake up to its deafening song
Wake up 'cause you don't know what you've got until it's gone
Until it's gone
Wake up to the sound of this time bomb
Wake up to its deafening song
Wake up 'cause you don't know what you've got until it's gone
Until it's gone away

It's gone away
