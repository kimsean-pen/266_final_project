Never get to bed
'cause the city's too loud, loud
It can break the bank
And run you out of town, town

I'm just a face in the crowd
We took a life for a ride
I'm California numb, damaged by the sun
If you could only see me now
You can hear the punchline
That I don't love my face
Or how I'm turning out

How I'm turning out
How I'm turning
I can't do over my head, how I'm turning
How I'm turning out

They said change your name
It's the price you paid down
And I don't wanna hand out
Hey, hey
She's a beautiful waste
And I will be afraid now
Maybe it'll work out
Hey, hey

I'm just a face in the crowd
We took a life for a ride
I'm California numb, and I'm damaged by the sun
If you could only see me now
You can hear the punchline
That I don't like my face
Or how I'm turning out

How I'm turning out
How I'm turning
I can't do over my head, how I'm turning
How I'm turning out

At nights, I'm still awake
And know It's never gone away
To wash the streets clean of blood
Make you the jury and the judge
All I wanted was a taste
And nothing's ever worth the wait
Will I ever get that flight?
I thought I was only staying for the night

I am in over my head
Or how I'm turning
No, I don't like my face
Or how I'm turning out
How I'm turning out
How I'm turning
I can't do over my head
How I'm turning out
How I'm turning out
