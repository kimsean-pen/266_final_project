You don't hear a thing I've said
You don't know my loneliness
I 've stand a sing and I feel depress
You feel the pain in my caress
You feel the pain in my caress
You feel the pain in my caress

So, Hey! know I feel,
Say! Did your love is real?
Hey!
make and empty whole my fears

You ever most the dreams in lies
You hides a cheeks

The worse is by

You don't know my hopelessness
a spent an emptiness

make an empty misery
Say me want me back.
