Jean-Paul Sartre

inflict the seed ov Eve upon me
the heritage ov Cain can't be undone
'tis my rejection! 'tis my denial!
that stirs with repulsive mortifications
they attempted to deprive me from my odium ov chaos
they threw my wretched body into rivers ov purgatory
for such is a consequence ov my angelic nature
abortion ov god in my leprous womb
soiled with the miasma ov the bleakest hemisphere

the formless fires ov Amenti unfold
not nearly as frenzy as discordia that breeds within
not nearly as frenzy as disorder that I bring
universe is drained
so is my heart...
...this earth grew weary and dull
is it the renaissance ov my rigid existence?
is there a future for me beyond the stars?
I drink to desolation

I drink to your demise
monarch ov neglected kingdom
oh great despiser ov life
et credo in serpentem

misterium mysteriorum
in nomen eius Baphomet
hearken! my Ophities

consume the flesh and drink the blood
obtain communion with utmost disgrace
reject the benefits ov eucharist
disdain the lie!
let you senses sharpen
let your eyes see in the boundless dark
resist not radiant light
be like comets slashing thru the vast skies
be like ravening wolves
unchaining hearts
now drink to desolation

drink to god's demise
monarch ov neglected kingdom
oh great despiser ov life
o leo et o serpens
qui perditor perdes
sis valens nobiscum
