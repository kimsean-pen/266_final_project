Looking over your shoulder girl,
Thinking you should have let me have it all.
If you're coming around again
Tell me how you feel cause I need to know

I could be your love again
If you just let me in.

We don't have to work it out
Cause I already know

Walking in my silver blues,
Tracked the dust to you.
I believed in something too.
One more life with you
