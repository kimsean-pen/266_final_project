It's a full tank and a get away
Get away
So before I break your heart
You should get the engine started
There's nothing like a
Nice drive in the summer time
Sunshine with the groove goin'
To help you move on
So get a move on
Get your mood right, maybe start a new life
And you're wondering
What to do and where to go
Tell me not to do it babe
I don't feel the same about you anymore
Don't get caught up loving me
I know it don't make sense
You're perfect on paper baby
But something's missing
Don't get caught up loving me
Girl I'm no good for you
It has nothing to do with us
It's just another season
'Cause I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't wanna be without you babe
I just think I'm way too young
To fall in love
Some of the times I guess
But maybe in another season
Imma be
Trying to find someone
Like you

Don't get caught up loving me
Don't get caught up loving me
I just think I'm way too young
To fall inlove
Some of the times I guess
But maybe in another season
Imma be
Trying to find someone
Like you

She only wanna get down
Hey
When no one's around
Oh
She only wanna get down
Hey
When no one's around
Oh

She only wanna get down
Hey
When no one's around
Oh
She only wanna get down
Hey
When no one's around
Oh

She only wanna get down
Hey
When no one's around
Oh
She only wanna get down
Hey
When no one's around
Oh
