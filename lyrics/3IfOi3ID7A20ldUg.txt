Benighted darker and darker
as I walk through the woods,
into the silent shadows.

As the sky goes from dark to black, ice cold whispers burns my skin.
From nowhere to the deepest of my soul they speak unto me...
grievance of sadness, like the gift of sorrow.
A Moon, a bloodred full Moon lights my black hearts night.

Lightning cracks the sky and thunders roll,
through the night a chaos of storms arise.

Purgatory. Burning flames catch my eyes.
Into the shadows (so dark) I hear the choirs of evil,
a "joy" in blasphemy beyond my darkest fantasies.

The Gate is open...

Into the silent shadows I crawl,
upon the throne so cold,
atmosphere of melancholy.
I will forever burn...
Burn... burn...

Into the silent shadows I crawl,
upon the throne so cold,
atmosphere of melancholy.
I will forever burn...

Into the silent shadows.
