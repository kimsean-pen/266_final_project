I'm fading
Much too fast, my love.
I'm waiting
For it to pass, my love.
Could I feel your skin on mine before I have to say goodbye?
Could I breathe please one last time in my lungs, before I curl up
and die.
Oh my world is los... ing light.
I'm leaving, this cold world of mine.
No pleading, is gonna turn back time.
Could I feel your skin on mine before I have to say goodbye?
Could I breathe please one last time in my lungs, before I curl up
and die.
Oh my world is los... ing light.
Ah Ah Ah
Ahh
(Ahh)
