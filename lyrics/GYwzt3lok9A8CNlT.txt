It's Mary J., she's back

Show love, show love
Show love, show love

(Don't worry about)
All those people talkin'
Trippin', asking about what you wearing
(Don't worry about)
The chick in the corner hatin'
Starin', you know she's always schemin'

(Don't worry about)
Just keep on movin', provin', this is what you doin'
(Don't worry about)
For every person that doubts you
Clowns you bringing that negative energy around you

(Show love)
You gotta just keep breathin'
Be happy that your heart is beatin'
(Show love)
Stop fightin', just be easy
'Cuz it could all be gone

(Show love)
You gotta just keep movin'
Don't worry about what they doin'
(Show love)
Keep doing what you doin'
'Cuz it could all be gone

Don't worry, show some love
Oh no, oh

(Don't worry about)
What people say to hurt you
If it don't kill you it makes you stronger
(Don't worry about)
Keeping' up with the Jones'
It'll only make your paper shorter

(Don't worry about)
Just keep on movin', provin'
That you just won't lose
(Don't worry about)
Remember when one door closes
The one next door just might be open

(Don't worry about)
Special plans, make change
Gotta get away of all this pain
(Don't worry about)
We've seen enough bad days
So what is there left for me to explain?

(Show love)
You gotta just keep breathin'
Be happy that your heart is beatin'
(Show love)
Stop fightin', just be easy
'Cuz it could all be gone

(Show love)
You gotta just keep movin'
Don't worry about what they doin'
(Show love)
Keep doing what you doin'
'Cuz it could all be gone

You just need to learn to let our head down
Something good as it goes around
Take full advantage of a sunny day
Better hurry before the sky goes gray

There is so much to be livin' for
Drop that top and turn on the radio
And let your mind get free
Come on and rock with me

(Show love)
You gotta just keep breathin'
Be happy that your heart is beatin'
(Show love)
Stop fightin', just be easy
'Cuz it could all be gone

(Show love)
You gotta just keep movin'
Don't worry about what they doin'
(Show love)
Keep doing what you doin'
'Cuz it could all be gone

(Show love)
You gotta just keep breathin'
Be happy that your heart is beatin'
(Show love)
Stop fightin', just be easy
'Cuz it could all be gone

(Show love)
You gotta just keep movin'
Don't worry about what they doin'
(Show love)
Keep doing what you doin'
'Cuz it could all be gone
(Show love)
