We don't need your protection
We can fight for who we are
Yes, you have a lot of power
But we don't mean to be stars
Just forget about the time
When you ruled all of our lives
We'll stand to our position
You won't get away with lies
This is the end of the age of deceiving
We'll be the first ones to speak up
This is the end of the age of deceiving
Will I be the first one to speak up?
Run
We don't need your protection
We can fight for who we are
Yes, you have a lot of power
But we don't mean to be stars
Just forget about the time
When you ruled all of our lives
We'll stand to our position
You won't get away with lies
This is the end of the age of deceiving
We'll be the first ones to speak up
This is the end of the age of deceiving
Will I be the first one to speak up?
This is the end of the age of deceiving
We'll be the first ones to speak up
This is the end of the age of deceiving
Will I be the first one to speak up?
You wanna say what you want
Just don't do it
You wanna do what you want
Just don't do it
You think it's all about you
Just don't do it
You don't pay what you owe
Just do it
This is the end of the age of deceiving
We'll be the first ones to speak up
This is the end of the age of deceiving
Will I be the first one to speak up?
