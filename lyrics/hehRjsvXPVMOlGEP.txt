Out of all the words that been said
You'll choose the ones that you wanna hear
The worst dream to ever be dreamt
Is a dead-end doubt
It is a devil to be paid

My godless liberation's die has long been cast
Possession of an evil confession

Faith in me
I have lost faith in me
Faith in me
Do you see the faith me?
Faith in me
I have lost all the faith me
Faith in me

Kurtar beni günahlarımdan
Bana sattığın tüm inançlardan
Benim için seçtiğin insandan
Kurtar beni kendi algımdan

Faith in me
I have lost faith in me
Faith in me
Do you see the faith me?
Faith in me
I have lost all the faith me
Faith in me.
