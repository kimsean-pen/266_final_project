Two weeks later like a surplus reprieve
I found a hair, the length of yours on my sleeve
I wound it round and round my finger so tight
It turned to purple and a pulse formed inside

And I knew the beat 'cause it matched your own beat
I still remember it from our chest to chest and feet to feet
The easy silence then was a sweet relief to this hush
Of ovens, aeroplanes and of distant car horns

A fire, a fire
You can only take what you can carry
A pulse, your pulse
It's the only thing I can remember

I break, you don't
I was always set to self-destruct though
The fire, the fire
It cracks and barks like primal music

I said I knew the beat 'cause it matched your own beat
It's become my engine, my own source of heat
The sea between us only amplifies the sound waves
Every hum and echo and crash paints my cave

A fire, a fire
You can only take what you can carry
A pulse, your pulse
It's the only thing I can remember

I break, you don't
I was always set to self-destruct though
The fire, the fire
It cracks and barks like primal music

A fire, a fire
You can only take what you can carry
A pulse, your pulse
It's the only thing I can remember

I break, you don't
I was always set to self-destruct though
The fire, the fire
It cracks and barks like primal music
