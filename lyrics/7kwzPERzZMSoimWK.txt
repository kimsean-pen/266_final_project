Can you feel it

Nothing that i do is right
I think i've had an over sight
You don't know what your doing me
Why do you always put me down
It's better when you're not around
We always seem to disagree

You're killing my love
you're screwing me up
I can't take no more and I've had enough
I cant't get it right i'm choking inside
I love you to death in the afterlife

But i don't know what it is that keeps me going
Can't get enough of this it keeps us flowing
I keep pushing ahead, but you can't stop me now

Took some time to realize
I Saw it right before my eyes
That we don't get along anymore
I tried my best to make it work
You always keep me in the dark
and now i'm feeling oh so unsure

You're killing my love
you're screwing me up
I can't take no more and I've had enough
I cant't get it right i'm choking inside
I love you to death in the afterlife

But i don't know what it is that keeps me going
Can't get enough of this it keeps us flowing
I keep pushing ahead, but you can't stop me now

But i don't know what it is that keeps me going*
Can't get enough of this it keeps us flowing*
I keep pushing ahead, but you can't stop me now

Pushin n a shuvin
Pushin n a shuvin
Pushin n a shuvin
Pushin n a shuvin

But i don't know what it is that keeps me going
Can't get enough of this it keeps us flowing
I keep pushing ahead, but you can't stop me now

But i don't know what it is that keeps me going*
Can't get enough of this it keeps us flowing*
I keep pushing ahead, but you can't stop me now
