Your eyes, your eyes that tell me everything
The first, the last and in between, that's everything
Your kiss, your kiss so wet I lose my breath
Makes me forget the old regrets, it's everything

You're not just a girl (ah)
You're more like the air and sea (ah)
I want you so desperately (ah)
And nothing's gonna keep us apart

Your voice, it's whispering against my neck
Your lips erase the old regrets of anything
Your mind, it makes me wanna know you more
So tell me what we have in store, tell me everything

You're not just a girl (ah)
You're more like the air and sea (ah)
I want you so desperately (ah)
And nothing's gonna keep us apart

And if you'll be mine (ah)
I'll never do you any harm (ah)
I'll give you the Moon and stars (ah)
And nothing's gonna keep us apart

You can say anything
And you can say anything
And you can say anything to me

And you can say anything (ah)
And you can say anything (ah)
And you can say anything to me

And you can say anything (ah)
And you can say anything (ah)
And you can say anything to me
