If you defray
You end up prey
Glow through the veil
Is this what you call frail

Ignore the edification
Of those whom you admire
We withhold our blessing
We refuse to calm the fire

Frail
Is this what you call frail
Glow through the veil
Is this what you call frail

Knit her a new pea coat
Drape it past the knee
The sinew has withered
Suture as accessory
