See, ya'll wanna dance? Yeah yeah
'Cuz I'mma make you dance
All I want is for you to use your imagination
Come on, come on, come on, come on

What makes us do the things we do
That keeps me lovin' you, imagination
And when you're in need, ain't got nobody
Imagination sets you free, free

Everything you want is real close when you close your eyes
And the things you think about the most they come to life, come to life
When your relationship is headed for the rocks
Gotta use your imagination to get you back on top

What makes us do the things we do
That keeps me lovin' you, imagination
And when you're in need, ain't got nobody
Imagination sets you free, free

It's the place you look when you want to have some fun
When you see it, say it, before it's done
Imagine you and me, and how it would feel
Exploring new ideas and what's gon' keep this lovin' real

When you get lonely, lonely
It'll make you get to a phone and
Tell me how much you want me
And when you have a bad day
A little bit of imagination goes a long way

Oh, true buff playa, that's the Chichi
Wanna get up out the store, you need to see me
Now I got you wondering what's behind the slouch
If you get too close will you get turned out

No doubt, it won't be the same if I hit it
'Cuz you always gon' want it the way I did it
I'mma keep you fresh, make sure you stay kitted
See once I got it, can't nobody else get it

From the bottom to the top 'til you say stop
You and me, wit the freaky south, I'mma gray drop
I'll kiss everything, I don't miss a spot
Stuff you ain't never seen from the man you got

I ain't hatin', my imagination's just more advanced
So when you wanna dance, I'mma make you dance
Tamia, I see ya, I'm still waiting, you make me wanna
Leave that to your imagination, yeah, yeah

What makes us do the things we do
That keeps me lovin' you, imagination
And when you're in need, ain't got nobody
Imagination sets you free, free

What makes us do the things we do
That keeps me lovin' you, imagination
And when you're in need, ain't got nobody
Imagination sets you free, free

What makes us do the things we do
That keeps me lovin' you, imagination
And when you're in need, ain't got nobody
Imagination sets you free, free
