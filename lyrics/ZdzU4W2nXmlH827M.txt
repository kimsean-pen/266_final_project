Wild and enigmatic varied in shape and form
They become black masters
Tomes and shadow creatures they travel in the dark
Form the council of the holy

When we summon the legion of fire and flame
And open the portal of fear
When the quest is so long and the silence is all we hear

In the mist of the morning a winters day
Came a man in robe from far away
Out of ashes and clay of the magic vale
Cause sorrow sail on the warlock's trail

Fire all around us my sword my only friend
On the field of battle
Enemy behind us they're aiming for your soul
And the gring is moving slowly

When we summon the legion of fire and flame
And open the portal of fear
When the quest is so long and the silence is all we hear

In the mist of the morning a winters day
Came a man in robe from far away
Out of ashes and clay of the magic vale
Cause sorrow sail on the warlock's trail

Sorcery enchanted by the spell
A stone is magical becoming like the gods elements
Gathering into the holy light
In life we burn

In the mist of the morning a winters day
Came a man in robe from far away
Out of ashes and clay of the magic vale
Cause sorrow sail on the warlock's trail

In the mist of the morning a winters day
Came a man in robe from far away
Out of ashes and clay of the magic vale
Cause sorrow sail on the warlock's trail

In the mist of the morning a winters day
Came a man in robe from far away
Out of ashes and clay of the magic vale
Cause sorrow sail on the warlock's trail
