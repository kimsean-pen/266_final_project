She's the light, she's the chemical fire
Burning so bright, perfect desire
She's the light that can never go out
Burning so bright in my life
Now she gets up, movin' faster than wind
Time again, hurricane spin
Turn around, she blows a kiss of release
Swallow my pride and give in
Keep on moving
Keep on working
Keep on learning
Keep on loving
Oh, baby, that's right
Gonna give it up, go back to the start
Oh, baby, so tight
Gonna give it up, go back to the start
Oh, darling, I feel it right
Gonna give it up, go back to the start
Oh, baby, tonight
Gonna give it up, go back to the start
Oh, darling, I feel this right
Gonna give it up, go back to the start
She's the sky, she's the physical light
Pulls me in, into her world
She's the light that can never go out
Burning so bright in my life
Keep on moving
Keep on working
Keep on learning
Keep on loving
Oh, baby, that's right
Gonna get it and go back to the start
Oh, baby, so tight
Gonna give it up, go back to the start
Oh, darling, I feel it right
Gonna get it and go back to the start
Oh, baby, tonight
Gonna give it up, go back to the start
Oh, baby, that's right
Gonna get it and go back to the start
Oh, baby, so tight
Gonna give it up, go back to the start
Oh, darling, it feels right
Gonna get it and go back to the start
Oh, baby, tonight
Gonna give it up, go back to the start
