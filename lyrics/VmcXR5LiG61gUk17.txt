Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face
From a chapter in my past

Talked for awhile, asked him how he's been
Said that he was seeing somebody else
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph

And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is)
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

(Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
And it's killing me 'cause, now I know
(Truth is)
When it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs and some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad

Then he said goodbye and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts
Walked away and that was that

And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is)
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

(Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
And it's killing me 'cause, now I know
(Truth is)
When it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

Now the truth is, it hurts
But I know that the fault's mine
Because I let him go
Tried to get over it, but it's messing
With my mind, because I know

(Truth is)
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
I guess I'm, I guess I'm

(Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
But it's killing me 'cause now I know
(Truth is)
But when it's all said and done
(Guess I'm still in love with you)
Guess I'm still in love with you

(Truth is)
Over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
When it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

(Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
It's killing me 'cause, now I know
(Truth is)
But when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

I just gotta be honest
I guess, I, I guess I'm still in love, in love
