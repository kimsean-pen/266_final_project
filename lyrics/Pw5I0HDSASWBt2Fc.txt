He don't ask for
Oh, coin and cash for
Poise and panache for
Some broken bachelor, no

She don't want none
Oh, gold and gilded
So all them children
View her with brilliant foes

Pardon for part in my sight
They see with a similar eye

Honey, I'm whole so what are we snacking for?
"I'm just a whore, boy, it's only natural"
Well, I bet we'd look pretty outside

He won't build in
Thrones of vermillion
Whose woes is filled with
Pseudo civilians, no

She won't take up
Colorful patrons
Whose motif plays on
False admiration, no

Pardon for part in my sight
They see with a similar eye

Honey, I'm whole so what are we snacking for?
"I'm just a whore, boy, it's only natural"
Honey, I'm whole so what are we snacking for?
"I'm just a whore, boy, it's only natural"
Well, I bet we'd look pretty outside
Well, I bet we'd look pretty outside

Well, I bet we'd look pretty outside
