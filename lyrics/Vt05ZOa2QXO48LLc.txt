She wants to move to London
She's got her big plan
She's got a year's rent and she's got friends there
She needs a change of scenery
But I could never move to London

She wants to move to Camden Town
But I've got my own plans
I'll get a cheap flight and visit when I can
She says she wants what I have

But I could never move to London
No, I can't go anywhere
I'm too broke and no fun
No, I can't go anywhere
Tell me when she's coming home

So tell me when she moves away
Will she find another man?
Another accent, a hiccup in my plan
To bring her home, to stay with me again
I'm overthinking

But I could never move to London
No, I can't go anywhere
I'm too broke and no fun
No, I can't go anywhere
Tell me when she's coming home

She wants to move to London
She's got her big plan
She's got her raincoat, umbrella in her hand
She says she wants what I have
I'm overthinking
(I'm overthinking)
'Cause what do I have?
('Cause what do I have?)
I'm complicating
(I'm complicating)
The situation

But I could never move to London
No, I can't go anywhere
I'm too broke and no fun
No, I can't go anywhere
Tell me when she's coming home
No, I can't go anywhere
I'm too broke and no fun
No, I can't go anywhere
Tell me when she's coming home
Tell me when she's coming home
Tell me when she's coming home
