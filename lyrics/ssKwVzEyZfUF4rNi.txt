Loverboy
I am
Not
Toy

Not a piece of gum
Gonna chew me up
Candy coated
Oppression

You make me sick
Let's call it what
It is
A disappointment
You make me sick
Let's call it a
Candy coated
Oppression

Not a lollipop
Gonna suck me up
Not a lucky charm
You wear on your arm

You make me sick
Let's call it what
It is

A disappointment
You make me sick
Let's call it a
Candy coated
Oppression

Oh it has been like this my whole life
It doesn't matter
Isn't right
Candy coated oppression
Candy coated oppression

Loverboy
I am
Not
Toy
