You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
It's down you go
When your walls fall like Jericho!
You build 'em up
You layer stone on stone
You build 'em high
To keep out your enemies
The sky grows dark
The earth is trembling
An unhappy ending to your final fantasy
You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
Supremacy implied
Who dares to overthrow?
Arrogance jusitified
Self-importance amplified
It's down you go
When your walls fall like Jericho!
We'll all enjoy the show when your walls fall like Jericho!
You're looking down
And feeling so profound
You're so impressed by your own false humility
The sky descends
The ground is rising up
An unhappy ending to your sense of deity
You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
Supremacy implied
Who dares to overthrow?
Arrogance jusitified
Self-importance amplified
It's down you go
When your walls fall like Jericho!
This is over
This is over
You sit alone
Up on your lonely throne
You're so oblivious
To your own frailty
The sky erupts
The ground has opened wide
An unhappy ending to the life you've glorified
To the life you've glorified
You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
Supremacy implied
Who dares to overthrow?
Arrogance jusitified
Self-importance amplified
It's down you go
We'll all enjoy the show
Can't wait to see you go
When your walls fall like Jericho!
This is over
This is over
When your walls fall like Jericho!
This is over
This is over
We'll all enjoy the show
It's down you go
Can't wait to see you go
When your walls fall like Jericho!
This is over
This is over
This is over
This is over
