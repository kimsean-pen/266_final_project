Well I am just out of school
I am real real cool
I got the jump got the jive
Got the message I'm alive

I'm a wild I'm wild one!
Oh yeah I'm a wild one!
I'm gonna keep a shakin'
I'm gonna keep a movin' baby

Don't you cramp my style I'm a real wild child!
Come on baby shake all night long
Shake until the meat come off the bone
'cause I'm a wild one

Oh yeah I'm a wild one
I'm gonna keep a shakin'
I'm gonna keep a movin' baby
Don't you cramp my style I'm real wild child!

Well I gonna pick you up in my 88
Get ready sugar now don't be late
We're gonna move it all night long
Until a whole lotta shakin' going be on!

Oh yeah I'm a wild one!

Oh after dark I can get around

Gonna move on I'll make every hop
When we start to boppin' now sure can't stop

Oh yeah I'm a wild one

I'm gonna keep a shakin'
I'm gonna keep a movin' baby
Don't you cramp my style I'm a real wild child!
I'm a real wild child

Watch out!
