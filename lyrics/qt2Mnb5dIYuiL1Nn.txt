Life, mysterious life
We're all moving around
Dancing the rhythm of life
Time, mysterious time
We're all counting the hours and days till the end of our time

Where we're feeling the change
and we don't know why
Choose one direction
just one for the time
Don't say I'm thinking too much
If you see what's behind

And these are mysterious times
Mysterious times
No trick of the mind
For this moment
I feel like we live in mysterious times
If you see what's behind
These are mysterious times

Soul, I feel my soul
For this moment nobody can stop me
from flying so high
Real, nothing is real
In a war of illusion you only see what you feel

Where we're feeling the change
and we don't know why
Choose one direction
just one for the time
Don't say I'm thinking too much
If you see what's behind

And these are mysterious times
Mysterious times
No trick of a mind
For this moment
I feel like we live in mysterious times
If you see what's behind,
These are mysterious times
If you see what's behind
These are mysterious times
