Trapped in a downward spiral of pain
Horrific memories, your life flashing by
There is no life left for you to live
You've had your share and more
Act of transfusion - blood child!
Transmigrate into the future or the past

Eternal damnation awaits you my love
In the kingdom of the sick and the rotting dead
You will suffer excruciating pain
You shall now reap the twisted fruit
Of what you once sowed
Transparent - revealing the lies
Transmutation - What you have become
Act of transfusion - blood child!
Transmigrate into the future or the past

(Chorus:) Transmigration macabre
