Wake up kids we've got the dreamers disease
Age 14, we got you down on your knees
So polite you're busy still saying please, please
Frenemies who when you're down ain't your friend
Every night we smashed their Mercedes Benz
First we run and then we laughed till we cry, cry

But when the night is falling
You cannot find the light, light
You feel your dreams are dying
Hold tight, you've got the music in you

Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through
Don't give up, you've got a reason to live
Can't forget, we only get what we give

We only get what we give
Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through
Don't give up, you've got a reason to live
Can't forget, we only get what we give

4 AM, we ran a miracle mile
We're flat broke, but hey we do it in style
The bad rich, God's flying in for your trial, trial

But when the night is falling
You cannot find a friend, friend
You feel your tree is breaking
Just bend, you've got the music in you
You've got the music in you
You've got the music in you

Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through
Don't give up, you've got a reason to live
Can't forget, we only get what we give
We only get what we give

Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through
Don't give up, you've got a reason to live
Can't forget, we only get what we give

You've got the music in you
You've got the music in you
