Where'd you go? You were there by my side
Keep believing it's my turn to hide
In a place where we don't have a prayer
There's a tether that's keeping me there

Trade our places, take no chances
Bind me 'til my lips are silent
Stay where you are, ever after
Chasing things that we should run from

Will we ever get away from this place?
It's an image that's burned on my chest
For a moment you need me to stay
Cold blooded and drifting away

Trade our places, take no chances
Bind me 'til my lips are silent
Stay where you are, ever after
Chasing things that we should run from

I'm feeling capable of seeing the end
I'm feeling capable of saying it's over
I'm feeling capable of seeing the end
I'm feeling capable of saying it's over

I'm feeling capable of seeing the end
I'm feeling capable of saying it's over
I'm feeling capable of seeing the end
I'm feeling capable of saying it's over

I'm feeling capable of seeing the end
I'm feeling capable of saying it's over
I'm feeling capable of seeing the end
I'm feeling capable of saying it's over
