Feel it in the one drop
And we'll still find time to rap
We're making the one stop
The generation gap

So feel this drum beat
As it beats within
Playing a rhythm
Resisting against the system

Ooh-we I know JAH'd never let us down
Pull your rights from wrong
I know JAH'd never let us down
Oh no! oh no! oh no!

I mean it, when I analyse the stench
To me, it makes a lot of sense
How the Dreadlock
Rasta was the Buffalo Soldier

And he was taken
From Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival
Fighting for survival

They made the world so hard
Everyday we got to keep on fighting
They made the world so hard
Everyday people are dying

From hunger and starvation
Lamentation
But read it in Revelation
You'll find your redemption

And then you give us
The the teaching of His Majesty
For we no want no devil philosophy
Give us the teaching of His Majesty
For we no want no devil philosophy

Feel it on the one drop
And we still find time to rap
We're making the one stop
And we fill in the gap

So fell this drum beat
As it beats within, playing a rhythm
Fighting against ism and skism

I know JAH'd never let us down
Pull your rights from wrong
I know JAH'd never let us down
Oh no! oh no! oh no!
