Friday afternoon, it's time to pack your bag
Long way to the club, it's time to go, because you can't be late Remember boy you can't be late
Great music in your car, two cups of coffee and cake
Each weekend in your life looks exactly the same
Looks the same
When DJ is your second name

Please tell me the truth
Is it hard to do?
When a thousand people party with you
I want to feel the same
Cause DJ is your second name

Could I feel the music just like you?
Please tell me tell me tell me what to do
I want to feel the music just like you
Please tell me tell me tell me what do
Could I feel the music just like you?

Sunday morning, wake up in another hotel
Long way home, it's time to go now, but today you can say
It was a great show, you can say
Great music in your car, two cups of coffee and cake
Each weekend in your life looks exactly the same
Looks the same
When DJ is your second name

Please tell me the truth
Is it hard to do?
When a thousand people party with you
I want to feel the same
Cause DJ is your second name

Could I feel the music just like you?
Please tell me tell me tell me what to do
I want to feel the music just like you
Please tell me tell me tell me what do
Could I feel the music just like you

Could I feel the music just like you?
I want to feel the music just like you
Please tell me tell me tell me what do
Could I feel the music just like you
