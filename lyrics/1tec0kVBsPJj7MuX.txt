I love it when you move
Like you've got something in your life
I like it when you groove
You take me, tickle til' I laugh
I love it when you take me 'round your boys like I'm your girl
I like it when you run your pretty fingers through my curls

Woo-woo-woo-woooo
Why, why
Woo-woo-woo-woooo
Why, why

Love's got my heart burning
And I will sing for it, and I stay away
Love's got my mind turning
Boy I fiend for it everyday
Don't you know you're beautiful
The Twinkle of my eye
Don't you know you're beautiful
You never make me cry-cry

Woo-woo-woo-woooo
Why, why
Woo-woo-woo-woooo
Why, why

Woo, you know just how I like it
Please don't let me fight it finally
You kiss me on the sunset
Woo, you know just how to keep it
Know just how to reach it
We can, either for the weekend
Don't you know you're beautiful,
I love the way you smile
Don't you know you're beautiful
Why don't you stay a while

Woo-woo-woo-woooo
Why, why
Woo-woo-woo-woooo (won't you come here closer)
Why, why (baby let me hold you)
Woo-woo-woo-woooo (you should come here closer)
Why, why (baby come here closer)
(You should let me love you)
