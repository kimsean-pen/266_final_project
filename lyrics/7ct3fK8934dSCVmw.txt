Well is it true what they say about it?
They say it's new, but I had to doubt it
And then they tell you everything about it
Had enough?
I got some people sayin' this way
I got some people sayin' that way
I got some people sayin' there's no way
Ain't it tough?

See the idiot walk
See the idiot talk
See the idiot chalk up his name on the blackboard
See the robot walk
See the robot talk
See the robot write up his name on the ballot
They say, this is what I need to get by
The truth is, baby, it's a lie

Well is it true what they say about it?
You oughta do what I do and doubt it
He won, you know he's gonna do something about it
Ain't it sad?
And if you don't wanna feel like a putz
Collect the clues and connect the dots
You'll see the pattern that's bursting your bubble
And it's bad

See the idiot walk
See the idiot talk
See the idiot chalk up his name on the blackboard
They say, this is what I need to get by
The truth is, baby, it's a lie
It's a ...
It's a lie-ie-ie-ie-ie-ie-ie-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

This is what it boils down to...

If you review the winning combination
Body at work and a mind on vacation
Who had the brain where it started to sink in?
It was you

You've seen the idiot walk
Seen the idiot talk
But you never learned nothing
And nothing isn't over
See the robot walk
See the robot talk
Still you never learned nothing
And nothing isn't over
They say, this is all I need to get by
The truth is, baby, it's a lie-ie-ie-ie
