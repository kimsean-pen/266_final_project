I feel the pressure, pleasure of you on me
And I forget to speak
With the lightest touch
Feel like I'm falling, falling from my feet
You make me week

I'm losing control, I've got to let go
You've got to do what you've got to, got to do
I'm losing control, I've got to let go
You've got to do what you've got to, got to do

Just go easy on me
'Cause it ain't easy to love someone like I love you
Forgive me I'm worried
That I'm losing and I don't wanna get myself hurt

'Cause last time it took me to my knees
(I feel it) And it hurt like no pain should hurt
And this time I'm feeling the [?]
(I feel it) And [?] body is hurt
And [?] body is hurt

Immobilized, I couldn't feel your eyes
But I'm afraid to see
When I fall to the floor
And take you here with me

I'm losing control, I've got to let go
You've got to do what you've got to, got to do
I'm losing control, I've got to let go
You've got to do what you've got to, got to do

Just go easy on me
'Cause it ain't easy to love someone like I love you
Forgive me I'm worried
That I'm losing and I don't wanna get myself hurt

'Cause last time it took me to my knees
(I feel it) And it hurt like no pain should hurt
And this time I'm feeling the [?]
(I feel it) And [?] body is hurt
And [?] body is hurt

'Cause last time it took me to my knees
(I feel it) And it hurt like no pain should hurt
And this time I'm feeling the [?]
(I feel it) And [?] body is hurt
And [?] body is hurt

I see your space I gotta keep [?]
