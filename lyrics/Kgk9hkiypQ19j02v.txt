You want to see it,
want to tick it,
wou want to lick it,
Want to kiss it
Want to whisper
in my ear bitch?
But I don't give a fuck girl,
because you gave me
a thousand bucks

Ask can one un-ring a bell
A mutiny of you from me
plink upon a clavinet
the exotic sounds of BLAHhHh
always feeling like I knew
who you were you but,
never what

Just from once come to me
when looking for
what means the most

Clap bitches

Denounce yourself
and walk the street
a private and boring dream
don't ask yourself if it isn't true
and wet your everything
with cream
kill the hippies, kill yourself
How you would but, never why

I call out your name in the night
and with certainty
you are worthless

Clap bitches, why why why
Bitch, why why cunt why
clap bitches
