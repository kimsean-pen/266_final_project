Paint the streets in white
Death is the standard breach for a complex prize
I think it's sweet of you and your parents are proud
But I would expect it from anyone now to protect life's indigenous sound

Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play

Worship, play, worship, play
Worship, worship
Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play, worship, worship

How the streets they swell
While the animals make their way through the crowds

If you keep listening you can hear it for miles
God, I trust everyone quicker with every faint smile

Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, worship
Worship, play, play
Worship, worship
Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play

Worship, worship, worship

And the crowd goes wild
And the camera makes you seasick
God it's so sweet of you and I know you're proud
And the car bomb hits quick click, faint smile
It's the same sound, it's the same, same sound
And the crowd goes wild
And the camera makes you seasick
God it's so sweet of you and you know I'm proud
And the car bomb tick ticks with the same sound
Its the same sound, with the same sound
