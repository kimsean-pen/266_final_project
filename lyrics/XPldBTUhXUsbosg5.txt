With some question of conquest and how it always relates to me and mine
And how you always end up disappointing someone
It takes more than a steady hand to help guide me
It takes more than prescription pills to bring me back
How nothing's ever right with you
How nothing turns out anywhere near how you planned it
With all I have saved I could buy you
