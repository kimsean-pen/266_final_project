From my one square foot window, I see outside
I've got chains on my feet, but not in my mind
I'll be dancing all day, see the sun outside
Don't know how long it will be
Can't stop me

I have the spirit indestructible
A heart that lovin' was made for
A body that's a miracle

I have a spirit indestructible
A heart that was made pure
Unbreakable and that's for sure
Unshakeable, so give me more

Through my tired eyes I phase off the rain
With the meditation, I erased my pain
There's a rhythm flowing through every vein
And the melody is never ending

I have a spirit indestructible
A heart that loving was made for
A body that's a miracle
Spirit Spirit Spirit

I have a spirit indestructible
A heart that was made pure
Unbreakable and that's for sure
Unshakeable, so give me more

A E I O U, A E I O U, A E I O U
(U O I E A, U O I E A, U O I E A)
A E I O U, A E I O U, A E I O U
(U O I E A, U O I E A, U O I E A)

A E I O U, A E I O U, A E I O U
(U O I E A, U O I E A, U O I E A)
A E I O U, A E I O U, A E I O U
(U O I E A, U O I E A, U O I E A)

And though they may, and though they may
Take you away, take you away
You'll never break, you'll never break, break

And though they may, and though they may
Take you away, take you away
They'll never break, they'll never break you

I have a spirit indestructible
A heart that loving was made for
A body that's a miracle
Spirit Spirit Spirit

I have a spirit indestructible
A heart that was made pure
Unbreakable and that's for sure
Unshakeable, so give me more

A E I O U, A E I O U, A E I O U
(U O I E A, U O I E A, U O I E A)
A E I O U, A E I O U, A E I O U
(U O I E A, U O I E A, U O I E A)

A E I O U, A E I O U, A E I O U
(U O I E A, U O I E A, U O I E A)
A E I O U, A E I O U, A E I O U
(U O I E A, U O I E A, U O I E A)
