I don't wanna be in your posse, girl
I don't wanna be all caught up in your social scene

I don't wanna be
Be in your front seat girl
I know I'm your recruit
But I ain't gonna follow suit

You got Morrissey and Joy division CD
But I don't go for them
I can't move to that beat

I like Marvin Gaye and gospel music
My soul and my heart
But you call it noise
You always spoil my favorite parts

I don't wanna be in your posse girl
It's not my scene
I don't need your company

You're skipping school 'cause it's cool
But it's not for me
I learned to dream
I learned to read at this old academy

You're out make every man
Your fleeting dream
But I'm a one-man woman
I'm all down with monogamy
You cuss and curse
So they think that you're rough and tough
But I like Shakespeare
And I find "dammit" heavy enough

You like new age
All the rage, philosophy
But I don't read my palms
I read the psalms
They speak to me

Don't wanna be in your posse girl
I don't wanna
Be caught in your social machine

Don't wanna be in your posse girl
It's not my scene, all of the aristocracy

It's not you
Maybe I'm just to pedantic
I'm a self-confessed
Idealist and romantic
You say "Join the gang
Be my Yang and I'll be your Yin"

But try as I might
I'm not your type, I don't fit in

I don't wanna be, be in your posse girl
It's not your fault
And I send my apologies

I don't wanna be, be in your posse girl
You're a trip
But I don't flip on your ecstasy

I don't wanna be in your posse girl
Trust me, you'll see, we're Yin and Yang
That's my prophecy

Yin and yang (that's my prophecy)
