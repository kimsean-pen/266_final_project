Soon,
Soon there'll be a fire.
Soon,
Soon we'll cut the wire.
It's been the longest time,
Since you have seen a sign.

Soon,
Soon can be forever.
(am I talkin' to you)
Soon,
Soon can break the meter.
(where do we go)
Things might
never change for better.
(am I talkin' to you)
I know,
you know.
(where do we go)

Who travels at the speed of light,
Can never see it shine.

There y' go,
Time is trickin'
People seekin' for the greatest fools

Grass grows time is tickin'
Children playin' on their way to school.

Keep your eyes on me,
Keep your eyes on me.
Keep your eyes on me,
Keep your eyes on me.

You're all they have towards the sun.

And make it all return to
make it all return to
make it all return to what
to what (repeat)

There y'go
time is trickin'
People seekin' for the greatest fools.

Grass grows, time is tickin'
Children playin' on their way to school.

There y'o time is trickin'
People seekin' for the greatest fools.

Grass grows, time is tickin'
Children playin' on their way to school.

Keep your eyes on me,
Keep your eyes on me.
Keep your eyes on me,
Keep your eyes on me.
