You'll never find
As long as you live
Someone who loves you, tender like I do

And you'll never find
No matter where you search
Someone who cares about you, the way I do

No, I'm not braggin' on myself, baby
'Cause I'm the one who loves you
And there is no one else
No, no one else
(No, no one else)

And you'll never find
It'll take the end of all time
Someone to understand you like I do

No, I'm not tryin' to make you stay, baby
'Cause I'm the one who loves you
And there is no one else
No, no one else
(No one else)

(You're gonna miss my lovin')
You're gonna miss my lovin'
(You're gonna miss my lovin')
You're gonna miss my lovin'
(You're gonna miss my lovin')
You're gonna miss my love
Miss my love

You'll never find
(You'll never find)
Another love like mine
(Another love like mine)
Someone who needs you like I do
(Like I do)

No, I'm not braggin' on myself, baby
But I'm the one who loves you
And there is no one else
And there is no one else
No, there's just no one else
(There's no one else)

(You're gonna miss my love)
You're gonna miss my love
(Oh, you're gonna miss my love)
I'm gonna miss your love
(Oh, yes you are)

(You're gonna miss my love)
I'm gonna miss your love
(You're gonna miss my love)
(You're gonna miss my love)
