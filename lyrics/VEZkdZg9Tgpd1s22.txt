Everyone was right
Left it at the afterparty
I didn't say goodbye and I didn't say goodnight
I wonder if you may
I wonder if I like
But I didn't say goodbye
I didn't say goodnight
And then you slip into me
Penetrate so suddenly
And then you slip into me
Penetrate so suddenly

[?] always around we can start again

Let your feelings show
It's easier than you would ever know
I'm desperate and weak now
Needing you to speak out
Either way at all
Say it's so

Now it's bombs away
Crashing in like a military
I never brought a fight
You fed me to the night
I wonder what you dread but did i catch your eye?
Well it comes as no surprise
I was in my camouflage
And then you slam into me
Like a train
So suddenly
And then you slam into me
Like a train
So suddenly

[?] always around we can start again

Let your feelings show
It's easier than you would ever know
I'm desperate and weak now
Needing you to speak out
Either way at all
Say it's so

Wonder if you know
I have been waiting always
Secret's safe to hold
I'm never bending
I'll never tell it

Let your feelings show
It's easier than you would ever know
I'm desperate and weak now
Needing you to speak out
Either way at all
Say it's so
