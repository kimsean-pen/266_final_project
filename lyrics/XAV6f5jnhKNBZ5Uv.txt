The distance and my hearts to sand
Flowing through the hourglass
Time to let go of all we know
And break our hearts in stride

I need you now more like yesterday
The last day I could see you smile
For the last time turn out the lights
My life on standby

So standby and watch this fall away and fall apart

Just say that it's over, it's over and she's gone
(Now she's gone)
"Don't worry", he said and she's not coming home
(She's not coming home)
It's over and she's gone

The distance and my hearts to sand
Flowing through the hourglass
I fall to pieces
I can't let go of all the times
I never said goodbye (now it's over)

Just say that it's over, it's over and she's gone
(Now she's gone)
"Don't worry", he said and she's not coming home
(She's not coming home)
It's over and she's gone

(Wake up)
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up now
It's over (wake up)
Just tell me it's ok to die (wake up)

Wake up now
It's over (wake up)
Just tell me it's ok to die

Wake up now
It's over
Just tell me it's ok to die

Wake up now
It's over
Just tell me it's ok to die
