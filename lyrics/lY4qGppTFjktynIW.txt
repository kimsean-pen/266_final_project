When I was a young boy
I pretended I had a job
My daddy said, "Pretty woman
Mama married into the mob"

A dream one day
I'd be living off this system for free
The dreams come true
Honey, welcome to my reality

Asleep all day
And wake myself in the shadows
(Gotta get up, gotta get up)
I've gotta catch that train
By midnight for my

Night work
Gotta do the night work
Punch that clock
And break overnighters

Night work
Gotta do the night work
Weekday 9 to 5 shift is over

I didn't have a penny
No, I couldn't cut a cheque with a blade
I used to have the shakes
But now that booty getting me paid

Asleep all day
But I break my back in the moonlight
(Never enough, it's never enough)
I gotta cash that cheque by midnight for my

Night work
Gotta do the night work
Punch that clock
And break overnighters

Night work
Gotta do the night work
Weekday 9 to 5 shift is over

Night work
Gotta do the night work
Punch that clock
And break overnighters

Night work
Gotta do the night work
Weekday 9 to 5 shift is over

And when the whistle blows
And your body can't take it no more
You got to keep on moving
Remember, this is what you asked for

N-n-n-n-n-n-na, n-n-n-night work
N-n-n-n-n- na, n-n-night work

Night work, aha, night work
Night work, aha, night work
Night work, aha, night work
Weekday 9 to 5 shift is over
