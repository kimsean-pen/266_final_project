I know I haven't taken the time
To tell you that you're beautiful
And there's nobody's fault but mine
I hurt the one I love the most
And you're the one I love the most
I should've put away my phone
I know, I know, I know that you deserve better

You can't dance to the beat of a heart that's broken
And you can't do this alone

So from this day on, I won't let you down
I'm gon' right my wrongs, I'm gon make you proud
Cause I made my mistakes, probably more than I can count
So from this day on, I won't let you down
Won't let you down, won't let you down
Won't let you down, won't let you down

So instead of making an excuse, I'mma make it up to you
I'mma get myself together, I'll do what I gotta do
Anything I gotta do, make sure take care of you
Cause I know, I know, I know that you deserve better

You can't dance to the beat of a heart that's broken
And you can't do this alone

So from this day on, I won't let you down
I'm gon' right my wrongs, I'mma make you proud
Cause I made my mistakes, probably more than I can count
So from this day on, I won't let you down
Won't let you down, won't let you down
Won't let you down, won't let you down

Let you down, I won't let you down
Let you down, I won't let you down
You can't dance to the beat of a heart that's broken
And you can't do this alone

So from this day on, I won't let you down
I'm gon' right my wrongs and I'mma make you proud
Cause I made my mistakes, probably more than I can count
So from this day on, I won't let you down
Won't let you down, won't let you down
Won't let you down, won't let you down

Let you down, I won't let you down
Let you down, I won't let you down
Let you down, I won't let you down
Let you down, I won't let you down
