Another summer counting clouds
Singing songs we love too loud
Regretting all our sunburnt shoulders
Guess I'll go home when I'm sober
Wishing you could see me now
A part of me is freaking out
What I will and won't remember
When it fades unto September

You know that we can stay if we want
Cause I don't wanna leave now

I can't forget the summer I fell into it
I can do this with one eye open
If I don't come back, blame it on this song
All I'll regret, the summers that we never spent
What do I make of the situation
If I don't come back, blame it on this song
(Blame it on this song)

Another sunset stretched for miles
We were all in such denial
That all these moments last forever
Taking pictures that I'll remember
Probably won't forget about how many times I called
I should've known better, people are bitter
But we have to learn to move on

Woah, woah
You know that we can stay if we want
Woah
Cause I don't wanna leave now

I can't forget the summer I fell into it
I can do this with one eye open
If I don't come back, blame it on this song
All I'll regret, the summers that we never spent
What do I make of the situation
If I don't come back, blame it on this song

I've had some time now to reflect
This raging storm inside my head
Wondering where else would I go
Asking questions no one knows
Is home where I lay my head
Or is it in this empty bed
Crushing all my crazy dreams
And everything isn't what it seems
Crushing waves sweep me right off my feet
When I wake up from this nightmare
I am finally right where I want to be
I'm finally right where I want to be

I can't forget the summer I fell into it
I can do this with one eye open
If I don't come back, blame it on this song

I can't forget the summer I fell into it
I can do this with one eye open
If I don't come back, blame it on this song
All I'll regret, the summers that we never spent
What do I make of the situation
If I don't come back, blame it on this song
