Look in the trees
Through the window at the moor
Like some...
You play with my cheek, yeah
Whisper something I were born
Liquid light harmony
Wrapped around inside of me
Born out of trees
On a moonlit song
It's free

Shiny and Warm
Shiny and Warm
Head in a storm
I'm driving home to you
Shiny and Warm
Shiny and Warm
Licking tar
I'm almost there for you

Wind down the window
And feel a rush of air around my face
Breathe in the night wet and warm
Feel the outside coming in
Look at the trees in the dark
Bending like a bony finger
Gravel flicks on a metal moon
Wild and free

Light licks the tree
Feel the rush
Cold air wrap around my head
You play with my cheek yeah
Whisper something nearly dawn
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, Oooh

Shiny and Warm
Head in a Storm
Licking tar
I'm driving home to you
Coming around
Coming around
Coming around
I'm driving home to you
Coming around
Coming around
Coming around
I'm almost there for you
