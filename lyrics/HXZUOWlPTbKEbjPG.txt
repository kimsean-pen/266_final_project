I don't wanna wake up
Not knowing where you sleep tonight
The things that you told me
Made it so hard to read your mind.

Wish you at least could be honest
I wish that you told me the truth.
But you keep complaining
And every time that you go.

You got me so good.
You really got me, so blue.
You got me thinking 'bout you
And I do.
You really got me
You really got me
You really got me good.

You always keep changin'
Every conversation makes a .
But I just can't help it
When keep calling out for more.

Wish you at least said let's break up
I wish you could say how you feel

But you keep complaining
And every time that you go.

You got me so good.
You really got me, so blue.
You got me thinking 'bout you
And I do.
You really got me
You really got me
You really got me good.
