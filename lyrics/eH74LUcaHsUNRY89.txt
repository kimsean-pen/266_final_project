This is not a means to an ending
Just a broken and twisted path,
foreboding the droning tasks
that face the shell of a shattered man
The shell of a shattered man

Dripping, Incessant dripping won't stop
Not for the machines that bellow through the corridors
Nor for the joy and wonder from my mind,
that oozes, pools and weeps through every orifice of mine

Patch it, plug it, dry it, Scramble and claw for the fragments that once were
Patch it, plug it, dry it, Piece it back together
Patch it, plug it, dry it, Scramble and claw for the fragments that once were
Patch it, plug it, dry it, Piece it back together

Now I'm scraping the barrel
And now I'm scraping the barrel
Is there something I must've just missed along the way,
A piece of me I somehow left behind, and lost between the days?

Scrape and rake my life away, Light grows dimmer every day, repressed dreams confide in me
Taste and feel, Erase the years, Another one down the hatch

Patch it, plug it, dry it, Scramble and claw for the fragments that once were
Patch it, plug it, dry it, Piece it back together
Patch it, plug it, dry it, Scramble and claw for the fragments that once were
Patch it, plug it, dry it, Piece it back together

This is not a means to an ending
Just a broken and twisted path,
foreboding the droning tasks
that face the shell of a shattered man
The shell of a shattered man

Bottoms up, another one down the hatch
