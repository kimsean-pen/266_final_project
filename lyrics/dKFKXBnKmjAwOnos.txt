Brother, my brother
You can hold it all together
Night brings night
Where it 's cold and dark forever
If our lines alright
I never wanna see the night
Why oh why
In the darkness I'll be back for you

Brother, my brother
You've got to hold yourself together
Night, all night
I'll be running out forever
No we'll live and die
Far, far away from any eyes
Oh, now the darkness comes alive
Now the darkness comes for me
And it comes for you

And I heard your final cry
Through the dark tonight
I'm coming back for you
And I'll find you alright
Where you sleep tonight
I guess that's all you do

Brother, my brother
We can hold it all together
Night, all night
We're running out forever
No, we'll live and die
Far, far away from any eyes
Oh, now the darkness comes alive
It comes for me
And I come for you

And I heard your final cry
Through the dark tonight
I'm coming back for you
And I'll find you alright
Where you sleep tonight
I guess that's all you do

And I heard your final cry
Through the dark tonight
I'm coming back for you

And I heard your final cry
Where you sleep tonight
I guess that's all you do

There's a dream I had
Where somebody watched out for me and you
And in the end of life
There was no one there for me and you

There's a dream I had
There was no one there

In the dark tonight
I'm coming back for you
Baby, in our lives
There was no one there for me and you
