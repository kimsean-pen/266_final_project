Well, I want my voice again
It might pull me out
Of a nationwide abyss
Make it overground

When it comes, it goes off
Summer's almost out
Get me off this water
Have you seen me now?

There's no alarms today

No other stops
No false alarms
What did you say?

This is what I've got for you
Don't you know by now
Tell me who you're listening to
Could I hold some ground?

Well, it's for you
It is for you
And I want my voice again
Coming from your face

There's no alarms today

No other stops
No false alarms
What did you say?

No other stops
No false alarms
What did you say?
