If you see me floating
Too many times
My face will be painted
In these white brick lines
'Cause all my fear's invaded
All the crazies put on busses
And sent up here to find you
Living on the limits

And if you say goodbye
Too many times
The sentinels will find me
And switch me off this time
'Cause all my fear's invaded
All the crazies put on busses
And sent up here to find you
Living on the limits

All you ever get from the sonnet is the count of the fallen man
Every calling cost made to your heart
You were in the kind of game that put the force in me
I was ever chasing fireflies

Sometimes I follow a firefly
He takes me into the night
Baby I just survive, I'm love drunk
I'm sorry, am I losing you?
Sometimes I follow a firefly
He takes me into the night
Baby I just survive, I'm love drunk
I'm sorry, am I losing you?

If all you ever get from the summit is the count of the fallen man
(He takes me into the night)
Every calling cost made to your heart
(I'm sorry, am I losing you?)
You were in the kind of game that put the force in me
(He takes me into the night)
I was ever chasing fireflies
