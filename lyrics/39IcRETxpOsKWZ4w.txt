Is this the way it's got to be?
Ignite the fire inside of me
Embrace the life of tragedy
A tide of war and broken dreams

I am torn in two
Hold on, hold on
We're barely alive
I am faded through
Hold on, hold on
The fallen arise

I will fight this war for you
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken I crawl back to life

Is this the fate we fall between?
Deface the life inside of me
Drain the heart with atrophy
And take away the remedy

I am torn in two
Hold on, hold on
We're barely alive
I am faded through
Hold on, hold on
The fallen arise

I will fight this war for you
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken I crawl back to life

(Please hold on)
I am torn in two
Hold on, hold on
We're barely alive
(Please hold on)
I am faded through
Hold on, hold on
The fallen arise

(Please hold on)
I will fight this war for you
And let the dawn of love survive
(Please hold on)
Broken I crawl back to life

Hold on
(Rise)
Hold on
(Rise)
Hold on
(Rise)
Hold on
