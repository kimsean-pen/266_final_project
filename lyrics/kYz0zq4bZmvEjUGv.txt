You are the one, so why stop it?
You are the one that calls me papi
You are the one, good and naughty
Baby, you're the one, hey
You are the one, so why stop it?
You are the one that calls me papi
You were born a star
But now you're my midnight moon and my morning sun

I thought that this love affair would only last one night
It turns out that this feeling I want rest of my life
I wake up holding onto you; every night, you do something I didn't know you could do
Yeah, and I got the feeling, ooh, yeah, I got the feeling

You are the one, so why stop it?
You are the one that calls me papi
You are the one, good and naughty
Baby, you're the one, hey
You are the one, so why stop it?
You are the one that calls me papi
You're the only one, the only one, the only one, yeah

You're the only one, the only one, the only one
You were born a star
But now you're my midnight moon and my morning sun
You're the only one, the only one, the only one
You were born a star
But now you're my midnight moon and my morning sun

You got everything I want in all the right places
Twenty different smiles and twenty more when you're naked
I wake up smiling next to you; every night, you do something I didn't know you could do
Yeah, and I got the feeling, ooh, yeah, I got the feeling

You are the one, so why stop it?
You are the one that calls me papi
You are the one, good and naughty
Baby, you're the one, hey
You are the one, so why stop it?
You are the one that calls me papi
You're the only one, the only one, the only one, yeah

You're the only one, the only one, the only one
You were born a star
But now you're my midnight moon and my morning sun
You're the only one, the only one, the only one
You were born a star
But now you're my midnight moon and my morning sun

My morning sun
My morning sun
My morning sun, ooh
My morning sun
My morning sun...
