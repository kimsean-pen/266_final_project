Every time I think I'm closer to the heart
Of what it means to know just who I am
I think I've finally found a better place to start
But no one ever seems to understand

I need to try to get to where you are
Could it be you're not that far?

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you
I gotta find you
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah

You're the remedy I'm searching hard to find
To face the puzzle that I see inside
Betting all my dreams, the color of your smile
When I find you it will be alright

I need to try to get to where you are
Could it be you're not that far?

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you
I gotta find you
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you

Been feeling lost
Can't find the words to say
Spending all my time stuck in yesterday
Where you are is where I want to be
Oh, next to you and you next to me
Oh, I need to find you
Yeah

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you (I need to find you)
I gotta find you
Yeah, yeah
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you (I gotta find you)

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you (I need to find you)
I gotta find you (I gotta find you)
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you
Yeah, yeah
I gotta find you
