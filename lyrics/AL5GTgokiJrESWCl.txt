Sew it on, face the fool
December's tragic drive
When time is poetry
And stolen the world outside
The waiting crush my heart
(Could)
No

Sew it on, face the fool
The tide breaks a wave of fear
And brave songs disappear
The secret voice of dawn
This last time
Raise my eyes

No

You'll taste it
You'll taste it
In time
In time

In time
In time

The right words
In time
The right words
In time

Sew it on, face the fool
The mirrors lie
Those aren't my eyes

Destroy them, raise my hand
Reflects in savage shards
A new face, soul reborn
No
You'll taste it
You'll taste it
In time
In time
In time
In time
The right words
In time
The right words
In time
