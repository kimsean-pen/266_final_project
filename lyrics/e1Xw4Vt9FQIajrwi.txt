Ed Kelly is that you speaking?
Tell Madini that I miss her face
Get back to scrying in the dark
Humans never ever get shit right
Alchemy is dead and so am I
Unless you make The Philosophers Stone
I'm sick of trudging thru the mud
Can someone up there just give me light

We're all just trudging in the mud
