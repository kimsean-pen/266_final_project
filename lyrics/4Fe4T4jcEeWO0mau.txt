I must've been through about a million girls
I'd love 'em and I'd leave 'em alone
I didn't care how much they cried no sir
Their tears left me cold as a stone
But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
Fooled around and fell in love
It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked
I'd get out my book and write down her name
But when the grass got a little greener on the other side
I'd just tear out that page
But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love, since I met you baby
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

Free on my own that's the way I used to be
But since I met you baby love's got a hold on me
(fooled around and fell in love) Woo it's got a hold on me now Yeah (fooled around
and fell in love) I can't let go of you baby
(fooled around and fell in love) I can't stop loving you now
(fooled around and fell in love) Hey... cause I fooled around
(fooled around and fell in love)
I fooled around (fooled around)
I fooled around (fooled around)
I fooled around (fooled around)
(fooled around and fell in love)
I fooled around, I fooled around and I fell in love
Fooled around
(fooled around and fell in love) I fooled around (fooled around)
Yes I did
(fooled around) I fooled around
(fooled around) Oh, I fooled
(fooled around and fell in love)
I fooled around, I fell in love
Cause I fooled around
(fooled around and fell in love) Oh
(fooled around) I fooled around
(fooled around) Hey-hey
(fooled around) I fooled around
(fooled around) And I fell in love
