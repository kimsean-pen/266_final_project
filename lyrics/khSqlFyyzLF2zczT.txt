I don't choose the battles, no they chose me
I don't choose the battles, no they chose me
I don't choose the battles, no they chose me
I don't choose the battles, no they chose me
I don't choose the battles, no they chose me
I don't choose the battles, no they chose me
I don't choose the battles, no they chose me
I don't choose the battles, no they chose me

You beat me up, you tear me down, you walk away
You cut the ties, you cast us out], you curse my name
I'm tired of your ghost always haunting me
You hold just regret laced with tragedy
But you are all I have so I stand

With my heart in hand
You pulled me into the open
I made my stand
But you pull me down
You dragged me through the mud
Now you're asking me for help
You only care about yourself
With my heart in hand
You pulled me into the open again

Take everything I'm beaten up and broken now
I lift you up and all you do is let me down
I'm so sick, you hypocrite
Take and take and take and take and take
Til there's nothing left
Then you're all I have, so I stand

With my heart in hand
You pulled me into the open
I made my stand
But you pull me down
You dragged me through the mud
Now you're asking me for help
You only care about yourself
With my heart in hand
You pulled me into the open again

I don't choose the battles, no they chose me
I don't choose the battles, no they chose me
I don't choose the battles, no they chose me
I don't choose the battles, no they chose me

With my heart in hand
You pulled me into the open
I made my stand
But you pull me down
You dragged me through the mud
Now you're asking me for help
You only care about yourself
With my heart in hand
You pulled me into the open again
