Every chance, every chance that I take
I take it on the road
Those kilometers and the red lights
Never looking left or right
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car

Jasmine, I saw you creeping
As I pushed my foot down to the floor
Round and round the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to 94
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
