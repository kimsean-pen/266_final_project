I need you, God, so won't you please help me now?
These are the only cards that you dealt me out
This is the moment that we won't be held down
Our words are broken, but they're spoken aloud
So come together, come together again
The time is now, let Armageddon begin
They say beginnings always start with the ends
I say forever and forever, Amen

Forget what you are
Forget what you feel
We stand apart but fall together
Nothing ever lasts forever

We're born to live, we're born to die
We're forced to swallow these pills and to never ask why
What I've become, why can't you see
That everybody, everybody, everybody's got this disease?
Everybody's got this disease
Everybody's got this disease

Deepen my vein, hang in the gallow
Past the pain, feeling so hollow
Drown in the shame, deep in the shallow
Not the same but feeling so hallow
I'd crash the train just to start a revolution
I'm not insane, I just want to be free
It's not the same if it's our execution
Let them all see you're Undead just like me
So I'm to blame, the one they follow?
Give it away, got nothing to borrow
Fuck the fame, fuck the sorrow
Live with today and never tomorrow

Forget what you are
Forget what you feel
We stand apart but fall together
Nothing ever lasts forever

We're born to live, we're born to die
We're forced to swallow these pills and to never ask why
What I've become, why can't you see
That everybody, everybody, everybody's got this disease?
Everybody's got this disease
Everybody's got this disease

I've tried to believe on my knees, it's so hard
When they pick and they pull and they tear you apart
But they won't let me go, no, they won't let me go
And I'm dying baby, dying baby, dying so slow
Walk in the world, it's so empty, you know
In the land of the beautiful, beauty is cold
And they won't let me go, no, they won't let me go
And I'm dying baby, dying baby, dying alone

We're born to live, we're born to die
We're forced to swallow these pills and to never ask why
What I've become, why can't you see
That everybody, everybody, everybody's got this disease?
Everybody's got this disease
Everybody's got this disease
Everybody's got this disease
Everybody's got this disease
