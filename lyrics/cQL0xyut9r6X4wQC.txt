Every now and then I fall
Every now and then I lose control
And in your eyes I see your thoughts surrounding me
And I've a little bit of thought for you

'Cause every now and then I fall a bit behind
Every time I stare into your eyes
'Cause every now and then I fall a bit behind
Every time I stare into your eyes

With your thrills, I find
It's not hard to be left behind
So I'll run, and you'll hide
We know better than to stay outside

You're cold and you're awake
You said I should never have stayed
But there's no better place for me

'Cause every now and then I fall a bit behind
Every time I stare into your eyes
'Cause every now and then I fall a bit behind
Every time I stare into your eyes

'Cause every now and then I fall a bit behind
Every time I stare into your eyes
'Cause every now and then I fall a bit behind
Every time I stare into your eyes
Every time I stare into your eyes
Every time I stare into your eyes
Every time I stare into your eyes
Every time I stare into your eyes
