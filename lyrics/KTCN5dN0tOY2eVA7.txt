Face up, untouched
Gazing at the ceiling
Game's up, never bring you down
Face up, I'll lose
Craving for some feeling
Game's up, we're nowhere to be found

I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck here in my skin
I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck with you

Tell me it gets easier, tell me it gets easier
Tell me it gets easier, that I'll figure it out
Tell me it gets easier, tell me it gets easier
Oh tell me it gets easier, that I'll figure it out

(Easier, easier, easier, easier, easier, easier, easier, easier, easier, easier, easier, easier)

Face up, untouched
Craving for some healing
Take off better than the rest
Game's up, it's too much
Oh your the king of healing
Take off, I'm staring at the ground

Tell me it gets easier, tell me it gets easier
Tell me it gets easier, that I'll figure it out
Tell me it gets easier, tell me it gets easier
Tell me it gets easier, that I'll figure it out
(Easier, easier, easier, easier, easier, easier, easier, easier)
I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck with you
(Easier, easier, easier, easier, easier, easier, easier, easier, easier, easier)
