When your soul finds the soul it was waiting for
When someone walks into your heart through an open door
When your hand finds the hand it was meant to hold
Don't let go

Someone comes into your world
Suddenly your world has changed forever

No, there's no one else's eyes that can see into me
No one else's arms can lift, lift me up so high
Your love lifts me out of time
And you know my heart by heart
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

When you're one with the one you were meant to find
Everything falls in place, all the stars align
When you're touched by the cloud that has touched your soul
Don't let go

Someone comes into your life
It's like they've been in your life forever

No, there's no one else's eyes that can see into me
No one else's arms can lift, lift me up so high
Your love lifts me out of time
And you know my heart by heart

So, now we've found our way to find each other
So, now I found my way to you

No, there's no one else's eyes that can see into me

No, there's no one else's eyes that can see into me (No)
No one else's arms can lift, lift me up so high
Your love lifts me out of time
And you know my heart by heart

Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
And you know my heart by heart
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh (you know my heart)
And you know my heart by heart

And you know my heart by heart
