She's my girl Friday

I'm her boy Wednesday

-Hello?-
You are the one I want to take out on the weekend
-Oh hi!-
Do not pretend you want to end what we got going
-OK-
How about a movie, baby?
Tell me that you're free then
-I'm sorry, but I think
I got Tuesday and Wednesday open-

She's got things to do every day of the week
While I am just playing hide
And desperately seek
I wait around the clock
But her calendar is blocked
I'm a hard place and she's a rock
She's a rock

She's my girl Friday
She's my girl Friday
I'm her boy Wednesday
I'm her boy Wednesday
She's my girl Friday
She's my girl Friday
-It's the biggest boss-
I'm her boy Wednesday
I'm her boy Wednesday
-Yeah, I love this-

I think we fell in love outside your favourite vegan spot
In a brand new Tesla, hotbox in the parking lot
Oh you looked so hella sexy at Coachella
Ain't nothing wrong when you hit the bong
And you wanna sing along

She's got things to do, she never stops for rest
while I am just tryin. tryin. tryin to do my best
I rock a party hard, at the biggest event of the year
I'll take you to the stars, just lend me your ears

She's my girl Friday
She's my girl Friday
I'm her boy Wednesday
I'm her boy Wednesday
She's my girl Friday
She's my girl Friday
I'm her boy Wednesday
I'm her boy Wednesday

She's my girl Friday
She's my girl Friday
I'm her boy Wednesday
I'm her boy Wednesday
She's my girl Friday
She's my girl Friday
I'm her boy Wednesday
I'm her boy Wednesday

-OK-
She's a, she's a...
-Oh hi!-
She's a, she's a...
-OK-
She's a, she's a...
-Oh hi!-
She's a...
