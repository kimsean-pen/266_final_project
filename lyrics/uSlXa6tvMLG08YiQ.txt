You're pulling me through time
Don't stop giving me that space
It's a kick in the ribs
I have to hide this side

Oh I love the way you let it hit you
Oh I love the way you let me kiss
Oh I love the way I fit you
Oh I love the way you kiss

So come on hold me in this space
Before I lose this feeling
Come on hold me in this space

We're going all the way
Nothing can avert us
Love that we're each other with each other
No faces to hide, no faulty sides
Peeling off the layers
Eating each other hearts
I fell it all, hmm I feel it all

I know that face, you make that face
You make when no one's watching /x4

So come on hold me in this space
Before I lose this feelings
Come on hold me in this space
So come on hold me in this space
Before I lose this feelings
So come on hold me in this space

I love our way, there's nothing wrong
I'll find a way, it's growing strong
Its coming near
It's already fated, as if we're bated
It's ringing in our ears
But some one will hate it
Some one will hate it

So baby don't stop loving that pain away
Your lips taste like that place I belong
There's room in you /x4
