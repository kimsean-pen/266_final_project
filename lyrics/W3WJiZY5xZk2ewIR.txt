I should have been the first to know
When the cracks began to show.
I guess I feel so.
I guess I feel so lost in the crowd.
Not wanting to be found.
We have to rise above,
I just have to.
Hail no hero, fear no evil.
So this is how I've become.
A man alone, set free.
The only way to survive.
Integrity
The path I've walked down is one of uncertainty.
So now the burden has gone, I can believe.
Just let it all go.
See what I have seen.
Believe
Feel what I have felt
Believe
I have seen the depths of misery.
Just one more year of this?
I don't think so.
So I'll pass on the torch and I free myself from chains.
I hope you can, I hope you can.
So take your cross back, and free me from the burden.
So weightless I am lifted, and I'll let you feel your body sink.
