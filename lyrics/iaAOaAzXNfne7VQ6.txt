Years ago, my heart was set to live, oh
And I've been trying hard against unbelievable odds
It gets so hard in times like now to hold on
But guns they wait to be stuck by, at my side is God

And there ain't no one going to turn me 'round
Ain't no one going to turn me 'round

There's people around who tell you that they know
And places where they send you, and it's easy to go
They'll zip you up and dress you down and stand you in a row
But you know you don't have to, you could just say no

And there ain't no one going to turn me 'round
Ain't no one going to turn me 'round
Ain't no one going to turn me 'round
Ain't no one going to turn me 'round

I've been built up and trusted
Broke down and busted
But they'll get theirs and we'll get ours if you can
Just-a hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Years ago, my heart was set to live, oh
Though I've been trying hard against strong odds
It gets so hard in times like now to hold on
Well, I'll fall if I don't fight, and at my side is God

And there ain't no one going to turn me 'round
Ain't no one going to turn me 'round
Ain't no one going to turn me 'round
Ain't no one going to turn me 'round

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
