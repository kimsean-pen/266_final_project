I can't breathe in
With hands on my neck
I scream back
The grip that holds on
The reason
I'm trapped in my head
Defeated

I never felt this
The voice in my face screams violent
The grip that holds on
The reason
I'm trapped in my head
Defeated

I never felt so close
To giving up my hope
Should I hide it
Should I fight it
Should I roll over in time
You never know
You never know until you know, know, know
You never know until you know, know, know
You never know until you know

I can't breathe in
With hands on my neck
I scream back
The grip that holds on
The reason
I'm trapped in my head
Defeated

I never felt so close
To giving up my hope
Should I hide it
Should I fight it
Should I roll over in time
You never know
You never know until you know, know, know

I never felt this
The voice in my face screams violent
The grip that holds on
The reason
I'm trapped in my head
Defeated
You never know until you know

I never felt so close
To giving up my hope
Should I hide it
Should I fight it
Should I roll over in time
You never know
You never know until you know, know, know
You never know until you know, know, know
You never know until you know
