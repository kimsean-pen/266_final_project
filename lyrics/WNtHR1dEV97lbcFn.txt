Why Why can't this moment last forevermore
Tonight Tonight eternity's an open door
No Don't ever stop doing the things you do
Don't go
In every breath I take I'm breathing you

Euphoria
Forever till the end of time
From now on, only you and I
We're going up
Euphoria
An everlasting piece of art
A beating love within my heart
We're going up

We are here
We're all alone in our universe
We are free
Where everything's allowed and love comes first
Forever and ever together
We sail into infinity
We're higher and higher and higher
We're reaching for divinity

Euphoria
Forever till the end of time
From now on only you and I
We're going up
Euphoria
An everlasting piece of art
A beating love within my heart
We're going up

Forever
We sail into infinity
We're higher
We're reaching for divinity

Euphoria
Euphoria
We're going up
Euphoria
An everlasting piece of art
A beating love within my heart
We're going up
Euphoria
Euphoria
We're going up
