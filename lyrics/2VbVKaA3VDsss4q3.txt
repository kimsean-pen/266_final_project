Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
I go crazy on you, crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you!
Can't you see what you do to me baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go skitzophrenic
One minute I want to slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy, the way we act like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit
'Cuz the next day we're right back at it in the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us, we can't figure out if it's lust
Or it's love what's that that's attracting us to each other
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch
But I stay and still stick it out
with you even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cuz I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's baby
Because you stay with me, maybe, 'cuz you're as crazy as I am
'Cuz when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators
And dildos, you fuck yourself so much, you barely feel those anymore
You're only 24 but you're plenty more ma-
-ture than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school, still you're crazy sexy cool, chillin'
You play your position, you never step out of line
Even though I stay in your business, you've always kept out of mine
I wonder what's on your mind sometimes
They say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
You ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
Maybe 'cuz were crazy in love
I go crazy on you, crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you
You are the ink to my paper what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do and the irony is you rely on me as much
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter-fluid the fuel my fire
You're my entire supply gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable is you're the legs
To my table, if you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I am always gonna make you feel I don't need you
As much as I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you are essential to me, you are the air I breathe
I believe if you ever leave me, I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall, you are the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie
You are the word that I am looking for when I'm trying to describe
How I feel inside and the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
You are like the root to my evil
You let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you
Before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much too much is never enough
Maybe 'cuz were crazy in love
I go crazy on you, crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you
