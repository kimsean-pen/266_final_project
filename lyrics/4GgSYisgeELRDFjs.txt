We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
Keep smiling through just like you always do
Till the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away

And will you please say hello to the folks that I know
Tell 'em that I won't be long
And they'll be happy to know that you saw me go
I was singing this song

We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day

Yeah, we'll meet again, I don't know where and I don't know when
But I do know that we'll meet again some sunny day
So honey, keep on smiling through just like you always do
Till the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away

And would you please say hello to all the folks that I know
And tell 'em I won't be long
They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go
I was singing this song

We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
