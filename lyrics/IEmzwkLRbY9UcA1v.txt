I'm rising up
Sometimes I want to get away
And from the moment I met you
I'm ready to fade
I ran into a brighter day
Like a castaway, sometimes I feel so separated
But I can never forget you
The emotion's fine
Yeah, you shine a little light of me

Send me your love again
'Cause you're my miracle
Yeah, can't describe but I'll leave it in a
Miracle, Miracle
Yeah, when I forget that feelin' I want
Miracle, Miracle
Send me your love again
'Cause you're my miracle

I'm rising up
Sometimes I feel so far away
But it's like somebody sent ya
I'm ready to fade
I ran into a brighter day
Now I'm fast awake
Your love is like a revelator
We're dividing the fiction
What's happening inside of me

Send me your love again
'Cause you're my miracle
Yeah, can't describe but I'll leave it in a
Miracle, Miracle
Yeah, when I forget that feelin' I want
Miracle, Miracle
Send me your love again
'Cause you're my miracle

You got me with my hands up
Got me seeing visions of love
Yeah you got me with my hands above my head
And every thought I can't believe it again

Send me your love again
'Cause you're my miracle
Yeah, can't describe but I'll leave it in a
Miracle, Miracle
Yeah, when I forget that feelin' I want
Miracle, Miracle
Send me your love again
'Cause you're my miracle

Miracle, Miracle
Miracle, Miracle
