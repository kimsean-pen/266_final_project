I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did

And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be

Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know

Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know

And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
And when you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be

Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
