Have you ever noticed
That I'm not acting as I used to do before?
Have you ever wondered
Why I always keep on coming back for more?

What have you done to me?
I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure
I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure
I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure

You really are my ecstasy
My real life fantasy, oh yeah
You really are my ecstasy
My real life fantasy, oh yeah

Not that I'm complaining
A more beautiful vision, I have never seen
If you don't mind me saying
A lifelong ambition to fulfill my dream

What have you done to me?
I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure
I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure
I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure

You really are my ecstasy
My real life fantasy, oh yeah
You really are my ecstasy
My real life fantasy, oh yeah

Uuuuu uuu!
You really are my ecstasy
(There can be no other while we still have each other)
My real life fantasy, oh yeah
(There can be no other while we still have each other)
You really are my ecstasy
(I'll never be the same)
(There can be no other while we still have each other)
My real life fantasy, oh yeah
(I'll never be the same)
