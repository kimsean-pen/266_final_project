I've never been the type
You need someone to blow them out
To climb my tower
To bring me flowers
But if you wanna wake me up
With some coffee and a cup
And talk for hours
I like the sound of that

But you don't satisfy the hunger in my mind
'Cause our bodies are predictable

Know I'm gonna call you on the phone
Know I'm gonna ask when you get home
I already know what's next
I end up in your bed
Then you gonna put back on your clothes
Then I'm gonna wish I was alone
But we never change a step
And do it all again
I'm bored

I just want some company
When I'm not between your sheets
When I'm not dramatic
So I pick my battles here
No, I'm not saying we don't do it, do it
Don't think I'd trade it if I could
It don't matter, no
It don't matter, no

But you don't satisfy the hunger in my mind
'Cause our bodies are predictable

Know I'm gonna call you on the phone
Know I'm gonna ask when you get home
I already know what's next
I end up in your bed
Then you gonna put back on your clothes
Then I'm gonna wish I was alone
But we never change a step
And do it all again
I'm bored

Not saying we don't do it, do it (not saying, not saying, not saying)
Don't think I'd trade it if I could (not saying, not saying, not saying)
Not saying we don't do it, do it (not saying, not saying, not saying)
Don't think I'd trade it if I could
It don't matter, no

Know I'm gonna call you on the phone
Know I'm gonna ask when you get home
I already know what's next
I end up in your bed
Then you gonna put back on your clothes
Then I'm gonna wish I was alone
But we never change a step
And do it all again
I'm bored

You don't satisfy the hunger in my mind
'Cause our bodies are predictable
I'm bored
You don't satisfy the hunger in my mind
'Cause our bodies are predictable
I'm bored
