Super star struck
Riding on your luck
Just to get to her
'Cause she's like starlight
She's close enough to touch
But you'll never find out

So you follow in her glow
'Till you finally know
Whether all of her electric lightning is just for show
Or she's got you spinning over in her gravitational flow

You're super star struck
She's got you feeling super star struck
She's got you feeling super star struck

Super star struck
Blinded by the white light that she's giving off
Maybe tonight you can be reflected if the stars align

So you follow in her glow
'Till you finally know
Whether all of her electric lightning is just for show
Or she's got you spinning over in her gravitational flow

You're super star struck
She's got you feeling super star struck
She's got you feeling super star struck
She's got you feeling super star struck
She's got you feeling super star struck

You're super star struck
You're super star struck
You're super star struck
You're super star struck
You're super star struck
You're super star struck
You're super star struck
You're super star struck
