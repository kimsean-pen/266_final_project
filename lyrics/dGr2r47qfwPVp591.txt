The claws of death await you
Soul less on your deathbed
The witches dance in circles
As your manhood fades away
When the world of glass shatters
A shapeshifter appears before you
Exposing your loathsome self
Life does not forgive weakness

This is all but falseness
You have nothing, you are nothing
I shall reveal your truth
I Am the Ghoul you fear
I Am the psychic truth
I Was There when Satan went
