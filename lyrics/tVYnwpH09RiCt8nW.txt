In times of endless wars
The blood awaits the beast
The Warlord of Wallachia
With his dead Tirgoviste

The blood of colder son
And my decaying friends
Brought by the name of Vlad
Ruler in the northern fields

Defender or tyrant
Where chaos rules supreme
Shaped of the order of Dracul

Defender or tyrant
Where chaos rules supreme
Shaped of the order of Dracul

The forest of the impaled
Like enemies as trees
The corpses in decay
Their God of disarray

The blood of colder son
And my decaying friends
Brought by the name of Vlad
Ruler in the Northern Fields

Defender or Tyrant
Where chaos rules supreme
Shaped of the order of Dracul

The broken conquers all
And my decaying friends
Shaped of the order of Dracul
