Come what may,
Feel this pain
Bleed like you never have before, never have before
The seasons changed you will remain
Like you never have before, never have before

And I will captivate you
With everything I've got
To bring the best out in you
One strength one heart
Is all you need tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Leaving one city for another making me feel sick
To the stomach but sick in a good way
Cos I'm pushing myself to be more outrageous
and I'm on my way to find it

And I will captivate you
With everything I've got
To bring the best out in you
One strength one heart
Is all you need tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight.

And I will find the time
To help a soul and heal a bitter mind
To help a soul and heal a bitter mind

And I will captivate you
With everything I've got
To bring the best out in you
One strength one heart
Is all you need tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
