Oh I
Had a lot to say
Was thinking

On my time away
I missed you
And things weren't the same
'Cause everything inside

It never comes out right
And when I see you cry
It makes me want to die
I'm sorry I'm bad
I'm sorry I'm blue
I'm sorry about all things I said to you
And I know
I can't take it back
I love how you kiss
I love all you're sounds

And baby the way you make
My world go round
And I just wanted to say:

I'm sorry.
This time
I think I'm to blame
It's harder to get through the days

You get older and blame turns to shame
'Cause everything inside
It never comes out right
And when I see you cry
It makes me want to die
I'm sorry I'm bad
I'm sorry I'm blue
I'm sorry about all things I said to you
And I know
I can't take it back

I love how you kiss
I love all your sounds
And baby the way you make
My world go round
And I just wanted to say (yeah yeah):

I'm sorry.
Every single day
I think about
How we came all this way
The sleepless nights
And the tears you cried
It's never too late
To make it right
Oh yeah sorry!
I'm sorry I'm bad

I'm sorry I'm blue
I'm sorry about all things I said to you
And I know
I can't take it back
I love how you kiss
I love all you're sounds
And baby the way you make
My world go round
And I just wanted to say:
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, baby .
I'm sorry baby
I'm sorry.
