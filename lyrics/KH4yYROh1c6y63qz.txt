Alright, Okay, We Gone, Rollit,

Yeah bring me champagne when I'm thirsty
Bring me reefer when I want to get high

Yeah bring me champagne when I'm thirsty
Bring me reefer when I want to get high

Well you know when I'm lonely
Bring my woman set her right down here by my side

Well you know there should be no law
If people that want to smoke a little dope

Well you know there should be no law
If people that wanna smoke a little dope

Well you know it's good for your head
And it relax your body don't you know

Every time I get high
I lay my head down in my baby's breast

Well you know I lay down be quiet
Tryin' to take my rest

Well you know she done hug and kiss me
Said Muddy your one man that I'd love the best

Well I'm gonna get high
I'm gonna get high just as you sure as my name

Well ya know I'm gonna get so high this mornin
It's going to be your crying shame

Well you know I'm gonna stick with my reefer
I ain't gonna be messin around with no cocaine
