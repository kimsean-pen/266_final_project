Wind me up, put me down
Start me off and watch me go
I'll be runnin' circles around you sooner than you know
A little off center and I'm out of tune

Just kickin' this can along the avenue, but I'm alright
Cause it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun

You feel it runnin' through your bones
And you jerk it out, and you jerk it out
Shut up, hush your mouth
Can't you hear you talk too loud?

No can't hear nothin' 'cause I got my head up in the clouds
I bite off anything that I can chew
I'm chasing cars up and down the avenue, but that's ok

Cause it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones

And you jerk it out

Cause it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones
And you jerk it out, and you jerk it out
And you jerk it out, and you jerk it out
Oh baby don't you know you really gotta jerk it out
When you jerk it out
Oh baby don't you know you really gotta jerk it out
When you jerk it out
Oh baby don't you know you really gotta jerk it out
