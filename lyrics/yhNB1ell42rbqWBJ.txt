Hysteria, mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!

Red alert is the colour of panic
Elevated to the point of static
Beating into the hearts of the fanatics
And the neighborhood's a loaded gun
Idle thought lead to full-throttle screaming
And the welfare is asphyxiating
Mass confusion is all the new age and it's creating a feeding ground for the bottom feeders of hysteria

Hysteria, mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!

True sounds of maniacal laughter
And the deafmute is misleading the choir
The punchline is a natural disaster
And it's sung by the unemployed
Fight fire with a riot
The class war is hanging on a wire because the martyr is a compulsive liar
When he said "it's just a bunch of niggers throwing gas into the ..."

Hysteria, mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!
Mass hysteria!

There's a disturbance on the oceanside
They tapped into the reserve
The static response is so unclear now
Mayday this is not a test!
As the neighborhood burns, America is falling
Vigilantes warning ya,
calling christian and gloria

I don't wanna live in the modern world!
I don't wanna live in the modern world!
I don't wanna live in the modern world!
I don't wanna live in the modern world!

I'm the class of '13
In the era of dissent
A hostage of the soul
On a strike to pay the rent
The last of the rebels
Without a common ground
I'm gonna light a fire into the underground

I don't wanna live in the modern world!
I don't wanna live in the modern world!
I don't wanna live in the modern world!
I don't wanna live in the modern world!

I am a nation without bureaucratic ties
Deny the allegation as it's written (fucking lies!)

I want to take a ride to the great divide
Beyond the "up to date" and the neo-gentrified
The high definition for the low resident
Where the value of your mind is not held in contempt
I can hear the sound of a beating heart
That bleeds beyond a system that's falling apart
With money to burn on a minimum wage
I don't give a shit about the modern age

I don't wanna live in the modern world!
I don't wanna live in the modern world!
I don't wanna live in the modern world!
I don't wanna live in the modern world!

I don't wanna live in the modern world! (Mass hysteria!)
