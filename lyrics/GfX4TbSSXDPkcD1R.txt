When you say that you no longer love me
When you say that you're going to walk out on me
You're kidding, aren't you?
You're kidding, aren't you?
You're kidding, aren't you?
Please say you are.
When you say you wish I would begone
When you say you won't be around much longer
You're kidding, aren't you?
You're kidding, aren't you?
You're kidding, aren't you?
Please say you are.
Isn't this just some game that you're playing?
You don't do really, don't mean what you're saying
You're kidding, aren't you?
You're kidding, aren't you?
You're kidding, aren't you?
Please say you are.
