Met you on a traffic island
We were there all day
In the middle of the world's highway
Summer left its light green lipstick
On our war faces
Took us to all the pretty places

Highway 405 will take you
From the Boom Boom Room
To interstate 5 which goes right to
The San Diego Zoo
San Diego Zoo, San Diego Zoo
San Diego Zoo, San Diego Zoo
How could I have ever left you?

Left you in a sidewalk cafe
I'm the restless kind
And I must have been out of my mind
'Cause I haven't slept since Wednesday
I've been getting thin
I just want to see your silly grin

Highway 405 will take you
From the Boom Boom Room
To interstate 5 which goes right to
The San Diego Zoo
San Diego Zoo, San Diego Zoo
San Diego Zoo, San Diego Zoo
How could I have ever left you?
How could I have ever left you?

Highway 405 will take you
From the Boom Boom Room
To interstate 5 which goes right to
The San Diego Zoo
San Diego Zoo, San Diego Zoo
San Diego Zoo, San Diego Zoo
How could I have ever left you?
How could I have ever left you?
