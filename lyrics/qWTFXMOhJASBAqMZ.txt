I know I see
An altered beast by the tree

Find a place to hide
Where I could steal a peep
Look to the sky
And I see angels weep

I see you
And I can see right through
I see you
And I will take you to my Altered World

Nine white teeth
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)
My gums bequeathed
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)

Hair on my skin
And I'm feeling beastly
Feel it trickle in
A new life with me

I see you
And I can see right through
I see you
And I will take you to my Altered World

Nine white teeth
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)
My gums bequeathed
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)

Nine pearl fangs, a true sign that you are deformed
Once a man, now a monstrosity reborn

I see you
I can see right through
I see you
I can see right through
I see you
I can see right through
I see you
Take you to my Altered World
I am an Altered Beast
