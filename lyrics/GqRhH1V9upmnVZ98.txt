I just wanna say that for the record
I don't wanna ever miss a second
I'll be at your beckon or call
I recognise I could be a better guy
I could be a better guy

Found out you've got your face long
That could be relatable
If I knew the right thing to say I'd say it every day
And you can get it anyhow
I hope you're feelin' better now

D'you want a coffee or tea?
We'll just chill, watch an episode
I'll fall over just to make you feel like you are home

Alright, take off my shoes 'cause like
I just know I won't stand up on my own
If only you could take a step in these nines
I can't rest till you realise

I just wanna say that for the record
I don't wanna ever miss a second
I'll be at your beckon or call
I recognise I could be a better guy

I just wanna say that for the record
I don't wanna miss another second
I'll be at your beck and call, I could just listen

I could just listen and you could see the persistence
That my infliction was missin'
I missed the boat by a distance or so
Or so it seemed but I'm dry as a bone

Just wanna make you feel at home
I'll make you my mission
There's no one else in my vision
'Cause you my only ambition

I gotta be sentimental now
I'll put you in the centre of every single centrefold
And it'd be the minimum
It's not as though you didn't know

I just wanna say that for the record
I don't wanna ever miss a second
I'll be at your beckon or call
I recognise I could be a better guy

I just wanna say that for the record
I don't wanna miss another second
I'll be at your beck and call, I could just listen
I'm gonna be a better guy

I just wanna say that for the record
I don't wanna miss another second
I'll be at your beck and call, I could just listen
I'm gonna be a better guy
I'm gonna be a better guy
