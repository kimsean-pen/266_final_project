In this passing world
There's no time to regret
Life's too fast to fold
So why lie to yourself
'cause there's nothing more
"Can't you see my light?"
That what mirrors behold
"Don't speak, let me shine bright"
You, my flower blown by the whispers of age
Beauty in the storm that relentlessly fades

Cold through the winter of life
Pulled down below into an ocean of lies
My withering rose

What a dreadful curse
Cast by nature on life
Nothing lasts forever
Can't turn back the hands of time
Like a grain of sand
Pray for me my Lord
In its hourglass awaits
"For the burden I hold"
For the very end when all torments decay
And the vanity will leave your heart in peace

Cold through the winter of life
Pulled down below into an ocean of lies
My withering rose

"My lady listen to your beloved King
I can see your eyes are now scared
And veiled by the mist of despair
Do not be conquered by your own fears
Don't let the illusion of perfection seduce you
Or you will be lost forever"

Desperate while my youth fades away
Sorrow is dragging my soul down
There's no word you can say to save me
My love
Cold through the winter of life
Pulled down below into an ocean of lies
My withering rose
