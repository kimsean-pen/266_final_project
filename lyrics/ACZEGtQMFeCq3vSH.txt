It's life that we took and we made it our own
Don't have to ask because we already know
I've been at times been described in terms of distance
It's different we're defined by what only some can hope is enough

Numbers statistics measuring our wake
Quantify, pacify and Ignorance
Creeping by yes we sat just waiting for the way
Seasons pass, no one asks no questions that don't read
Is that enough
They take oh they take until there's nothing left
Disappear and remember move on to the next
Where's the heart and the soul? Where's the meaning in this mess?
Is it the blind leading the blind?
Check your hand or make your breath
Oh what's enough?

It's the person that we face in the mirror
There's a truth that we once knew and no longer can fear
They could take all our heroes and present needs last one
It's a spirit of resilience so things never come undone
And that's enough
Yeah that's enough oh yeah that's forever
Say oh who woh
[Jordan Dreyer] Woh oh woh oh
