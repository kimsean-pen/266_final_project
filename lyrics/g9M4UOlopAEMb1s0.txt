L' Via
Hija de Miranda
Tu Apellido se cambió
L' Via
Sin Ojos me quieres dar
Una historia sin mi madre
Solo tengo que decirte
El dolor de noche dice
Solo se quedo el vestido
Le lave la sangre

L' Via
No dejes de descansar
En la calle caminas
Quien te va a perseguir
L' Via
Te quieren matar
Dientes de Machete
Cabezas de gallo

L' Via
Durmiendo en paz
Abre los ojos
Todo cambiará
L' Via
Soñado de venganza
Y yo te lo juro
Lo van a pagar
Blackmailed, she fell off every mountain
The ones they tightly wrapped in tape
In her eraser sang the guilty
As it made the best mistakes
And with every body that I find
And with every claymore that they mine
I won't forget who I'm looking for
Oh mother help me I'm looking for

Solo tengo
Una hora
Y me duermo
Terminado
Por veinte y cinco
Años pasaron
Siguen los cuerpos
Aqui temblando
Tome la sangre
Comi el cuerpo
Mis lagrimas
Quiebra el espejo

When all the worms come
Crawlin out of your head
Telling you
Don't you be afraid
When all the worms come
Crawlin out of your head
Telling you
Don't you be afraid

Blackmailed she fell off every mountain
The ones they tightly wrapped in tape
In her eraser sang the guilty
As it made the best mistakes
Shark kites got tangled in the moleskin
Urgent plea of escape
A mouth to mouth on the chalkboard
Written in fingernail distaste
And with every body that I find
And with every claymore that they mine
I won't forget who I'm looking for
Oh mother help me I'm looking for

Blackmailed she fell off every mountain

In her eraser sang the guilty

And with every body that I find
And with every claymore that they mine
