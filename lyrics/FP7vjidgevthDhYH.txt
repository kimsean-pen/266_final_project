Putting all the vegetables away,
That you bought at the grocery store today,
And it goes fast,
You think of the past,

Suddenly everything has changed,

Driving home the sky accelerates,
And the clouds all form a geometric shape,
And it goes fast,
You think of the past,

Suddenly everything has changed,

Putting all the clothes you washed away,
As you're folding up the shirts you hesitate,
Then it goes fast,
Think of the past,

Suddenly everything has changed
