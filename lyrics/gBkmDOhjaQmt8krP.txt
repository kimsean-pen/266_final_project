Oo-oo-oooh

Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadow's flickering
My heart's jittering
Just you and I

Not tonight
Come tomorrow
When everything's sunny and bright (sunny and bright)
No, no, no, come tomorrow
'Cause then we'll be waiting for the moonlight
(We'll go walking in the moonlight)
(Walking in the moonlight)

Ooh, laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please, stay a while

Ooh, you know I never could foresee the future years
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
You know I never could see where life was leading me
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
But will we be together (do, do), forever (ever)?
What will be, my love, can't you see that I just don't know, don't know?

No, no, no, not tonight, come tomorrow
Everything's gonna be sunny and bright
Wait and see if tomorrow
We'll be as happy as we feel tonight
Oh, we'll be happy, we'll be happy (Walking in the moonlight)
(Walking in the moonlight)

I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where we lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight (just you and I)
Ooh, just you and I
Just you and I

Can't you see that we've gotta be together, be together?
Just you and I, just you and I

No more questions now
Just you and I
Come on, come on
