Take your books and learn all the things
Even the things that you don't want
Cause that's how you're gonna get a work
Just forget all your dreams

Look forward, never to right or left
Stop turning your head up to the past
Fuck the padrons and chase your dreams
You are not the owner of my destiny

After reading, paint your mind in grey
And your world will be perfect
Don't appreciate the rose in the fields
They will not make money for me

Look forward, never to right or left
Stop turning your head up to the past
Fuck the padrons and chase your dreams
You are not the owner of my destiny

Look forward, never to right or left
Stop turning your head up to the past
Fuck the padrons and chase your dreams
You are not the owner of my destiny

The only music you're up to listen
Is the sirens that play at 6
Be part of a family that put you down
And don't care about what you believe

Look forward, never to right or left
Stop turning your head up to the past
Fuck the padrons and chase your dreams
You are not the owner of my destiny
