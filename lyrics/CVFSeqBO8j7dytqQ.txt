It's Easy

Hey
I've got no place to be
And no one I'd rather see
I won't mind if you can find
The time to stay with me
I've got no time for wasting
I've got to live my life while I can
I won't hide if you decide
To let me be your man

Cause when I get close to you, not much to say
I get that same old feeling I had in my younger days

And I can show you the way
It's just a game we play
It's easy, taking it day by day

Hey
You know I would concede
And I think we both agree
You and I can testify
That love is what we need
Just take a look around you, living for the future is blind
I believe what we can achieve will soon be left behind

The things that I try to say are so hard to find
When you doubt what your life is about let me ease you mind

And I can show you the way
It's just a game we play
It's easy, taking it day by day

It's Easy

Hey
I've got no place to be
And no one I'd rather see
I won't mind if you should find
That you're in love with me
We've got no time to worry
We've got to live our lives while we can
I won't hide if you decide
To let me be your man

Cause when I get close to you, not much to say
I get that same old feeling I had in my younger days

And I can show you the way
It's just a game we play
It's easy, taking it day by day
Ooooh, It's easy, taking it day by day
