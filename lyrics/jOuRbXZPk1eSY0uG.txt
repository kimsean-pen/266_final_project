I am a prisioner
In a dark jail called mind
I feel memories colliding against the walls
Of my brain

So many places and facts
So many faces in all around
Rotten portraits from a distant past
In cold chains

()
They testified my crimes
Nobody can hear the silent shout
Of another name written in the black tome
Of damned souls

Nostalgia is a trap
Undead voices inside my head
Unconsciously created for keep me far
From neurosis

Hallowed be the future
Uncertain chapters sang by the angels choir
A lost ship in the ocean of the chronicles
Of my life

Of my life
Walking through the factorytown
Nobody can hear the silent shout
Walking through the factorytown
Nobody can hear my silent shout
