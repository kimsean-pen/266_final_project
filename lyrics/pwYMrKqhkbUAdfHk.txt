I wanna explode
Watch me, I'm a lucky girl
See I, I like you
So won't you pay
If you wanna go down

I love to watch you, honey
You need me so let's see
What do you care, if you want to
You should pay if you wanna go

Don't walk away
Don't walk away love
Don't walk away
Don't walk away love

I wanna touch you, slowly
I'm a lonely girl
Come on you want to
So won't you pay
If you want to go down

I'd love to hurt you, easy
I've got you, inside me
What do you care, if you want to
You should pay
If you wanna go

Don't walk away
Don't walk away love
Don't walk away
Just stay right here

(Why don't you pay if you wanna go)
(You got to pay if you want some more)
(Why don't you pay if you wanna go)
(You got to pay if you want some more)
Don't walk away
(Why don't you pay if you wanna go)
Don't walk away love
(You got to pay if you want some more)
Don't walk away
(Why don't you pay if you wanna go)
Just stay right here
(You got to pay if you want some more)
