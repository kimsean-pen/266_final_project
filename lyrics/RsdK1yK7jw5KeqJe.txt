The night is young and so are we, so you what you say
We go and see it all for ourselves?
Yeah, yeah
There's a spot I know down the road we can go
Only me and you and no one else
Yeah, yeah

I ain't looking for a crowd
Another night on the town
I want a one way ticket where the creaking crickets
Are the only sound

So baby, pick me up, I'll be in the drive
Take me where the moon's hanging in the sky
We can park it by the river
Get out and throw the tailgate down down down
You can steal a kiss, maybe even two
Only the track and the tree's gonna see what we do
All I wanna be is wrapped in your arms, laying in the dark
Looking at stars

We can rename constellations while we're making wishes
Don't it make you feel so small?
Yeah, yeah
We can talk about forever for a minute, maybe never
Just kiss and say nothing at all
Yeah, yeah

Baby, hurry up and get here
So we can disappear
The clouds are breaking, don't keep me waiting
Never seeing a night this clear

So baby, pick me up, I'll be in the drive
Take me where the moon's hanging in the sky
We can park it by the river
Get out and throw the tailgate down down down
You can steal a kiss, maybe even two
Only the track and the tree's gonna see what we do
All I wanna be is wrapped in your arms, laying in the dark
Looking at stars

I ain't looking for a crowd
Another night on the town
I want a one way ticket where the creaking crickets
Are the only sound

So baby, pick me up, I'll be in the drive
Take me where the moon's hanging in the sky
We can park it by the river
Get out and throw the tailgate down down down
You can steal a kiss, maybe even two
Only the track and the tree's gonna see what we do
All I wanna be is wrapped in your arms, laying in the dark
Looking at stars

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Just looking at stars
