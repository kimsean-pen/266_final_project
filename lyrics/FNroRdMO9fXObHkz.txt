I'm itchin' on a photograph
Yeah I'm scratching on a thermostat
I'm giving up on looking back
I'm letting go of what I had.

I'm itchin' on a photograph
Yeah I'm scratching on a thermostat
I'm letting go all of that I had
I'm itchin' on a photograph.

Still the rain come down and you know now
Put the fire out, you'll burn.
Let them wonder how you can see now
That this landing ground is so.

I'm waiting on my ma' and dad
I'm swinging on a branch that'll last
I'm going up then falling back
I'm itchin' a photograph

Still that rain come down and you know now
Put the fire out, you'll burn.
Let them wonder how you can see now
At this landing ground
And it's all while you were sleeping
It's all while you were.

I'm itchin' on a photograph
I'm scratching on a thermostat
I'm letting go of all that I had
I'm living now and living loud.

I'm itchin' on a photograph
I'm scratching on a thermostat
I'm letting go of all that I had
I'm living now and living loud.
