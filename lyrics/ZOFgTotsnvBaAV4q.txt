Once I saw the light in your eyes
But nothing will be any longer the way I remember
I've become someone else and I can't go back, I tried
I'm lost in the fields of snow far from home

Follow the coast under the frozen sky
With a growing sorrow and weary eyes
Swallow the ghost of lucid dream
And silent will be the mournful sea

The sands of life covered in white
From the darkest nights to the blinding light
I almost reached home, I was so close
But to be left alone is what hurts the most

Am I the only one awake
Am I the one who is fading away
There was so much I wanted to say
Do I have a reason anymore to stay

Washed away by the morning sun
Hear the howling call from the other side
And so much was left undone
The weight of the world quietly crushed the dying light
Washed away by the frozen stars
Feel the burning coldness of the falling snow
And one day when everything is gone
The trail in the snow disapears, Am I finally home
Washed away by the morning sun
Washed away by the frozen stars
And so much was left undone
And one day when everything will be gone
Washed away by the morning sun
Hear the howling call from the other side
And so much was left undone
The weight of the world quietly crushed the dying light
Washed away by the frozen stars
Feel the burning coldness of the falling snow
And one day when everything is gone
The trail in the snow disapears, Am I finally home
