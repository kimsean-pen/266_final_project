Yeah, yeah, yeah

One more time doing one more line
One more shot till we all ignite
Spend all of my money and more
It's blurry in the moonlight
I'll never see the sunrise
I'll drink until I go blind
Drink until I go blind

I set my friends on fire
And now they're all lit up
Welcome to my empire
Where everybody's fucked up

Cheers to the top
Cheers to the middle
Cheers to us all getting a little, yeah

All these girls seem to know my name
I'm too fucked up to care anyway
Breaking hearts and bottles everywhere
Bartender bring another round
There's no sign of us slowing down
Both my middle fingers in the air
It's blurry in the moonlight
I'll never see the sunrise
I'll drink until I go blind
Drink until I go blind

I set my friends on fire
And now they're all lit up
Welcome to my empire
Where everybody's fucked up

Cheers to the top
Cheers to the middle
Cheers to us all getting a little, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I set my friends on fire
And now they're all lit up
Welcome to my empire
Where everybody's fucked up

Cheers to the top
Cheers to the middle
Cheers to us all getting a little, yeah
(Yeah) Cheers to the top
Cheers to the middle
Cheers to us all getting a little, yeah
