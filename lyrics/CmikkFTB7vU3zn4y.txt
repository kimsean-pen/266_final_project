She never breaks into the conversation
He seems to be the reason why she lives
She tries to be the perfect kind of stranger
But we always seem to love the most the ones who never give, yeah

It's between two hearts
A personal situation
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a reputation

We never have to ask her why she's crying
The smile she had's been kicked into a frown
But still it makes her day to be his pleasure
Should we open up her eyes? Can we ever break the spell?
No one can tell, ah well

It's between two hearts
A personal situation
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a bad reputation

Put on your party faces and come along
Join in the big parade
Here comes the camera
Do you look as good as your sister?
Smile at the animals
They should be the ones in the cages
Oh turn the pages

Another way to spend a rainy Sunday
Waiting for a call that never comes
The mystery is how she makes her choices
But don't we always choose the ones who hide the sun
Everyone

It's between two hearts
Love and desperation
Between two hearts
The kind of love, the kind of love

Between two hearts
A personal situation
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a reputation
