It's been a long long long long
A long time
Imma go go go go
Gonna make you mine
Gonna make you mine
I said I'm ready to receive you
Ready to receive you
My soul is running back
There's no no no no
No coming back, no coming back
I said I'm ready to receive you
Ready to receive you

I said I'm ready to receive you
Ready to receive you
Ready to receive you
I said I'm ready to receive you
