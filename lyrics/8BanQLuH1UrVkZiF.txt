Well they say that now's the time to start
And blessed are the young at heart
And she's just here to look the part
In the frilt of all this labor land
On Friday nights and football stands
I've been fumbled by so many hands

I've been looking for untangled love
But it's hard to get a handle on
And I always hoped I'd see the light
And break the bad luck in my life
Untangled love
Yeah, I can see it in your eyes
Untangled love
Oh

It's been 21 years since I left home
I'm still looking for a place to call my own
I see the silver lights shinning like polished chrome

I've been looking for untangled love
But it's hard to get a handle on
And I always hoped I'd see the light
And break the bad luck in my life
Untangled love
Yeah, I can see it in your eyes
Untangled love
True, blue sky

If a landslikde tumbles down today
I'm on your side
If a twister sweeps it all away
I'm on your side
Stay close my love
This ain't luck
Look out trouble
We've had enough

I've been looking for untangled love
But it's hard to get a handle on
It took a lot of faith
It tooks a lot of lies
But I finally came to realize
Untangled love
I can see it in your eyes
Untangled love
And it took me by surprise
Untangled love
Yeah. I can see it in your eyes
Untangled love
True
Untangled love
I can see it in your eyes
Untangled love
And you took me by suprise
Untangled love
You took me by surprise
