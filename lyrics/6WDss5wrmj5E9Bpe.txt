We are falling over the ends of the earth
So gather your children before you
And tell them that these are final days of
all
Preach to the paupers
And sing to the slaves

I see you've chosen to loose your faith
To burn your brigdes and lose your way
From mountain top to valley deep
From shore to cursed shore
What Nation, what State what Land is this?.
The wretched Tribe of Nero...

Sing Sing Sing to the Slaves
Sing to the Slaves that Rome Burns

Are our bones not dust?.
Is your Blood not Poison?.
On my knees in the black light
Praying for Salvation, bitter Redemption
So throw your dice and cast your shadow
You may look away
Bur your childreen will not...
