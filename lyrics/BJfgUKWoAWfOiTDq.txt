Within consciousness there comes a conflict
Believe what's been set bred to listen and follow
But we need to question all that has been said
From religious motives to philosophy most hollow

Defying the sacred your faith predicated
On hope that it's god that you know
But his lack of existence and nagging persistence
That's into the void we all go

Before we fall (Before we fall)
Into the black abyss
Darkness unfolds (Darkness unfolds)
Receive your crown of sin

Preaching your hatred
Hypocrisy runs through
Twisted your words
Kill unto others as they would kill you

Before we fall (Before we fall)
Into the black abyss
Darkness unfolds (Darkness unfolds)
Receive your crown of sin

Defying the sacred
End the oppression from which it lies
Defying the sacred
Discover salvation embracing death

Defying the sacred a perversion of text
Through manipulation you believe what's been said
No reason for existence, no purpose for lies
Meaning created, accept this truth and die

Before we fall (Before we fall)
Into the black abyss
Darkness unfolds (Darkness unfolds)
Receive your crown of sin

Defying the sacred
End the oppression from which it lies
Defying the sacred
Discover salvation embracing death

Defying the sacred a perversion of text
Through manipulation you believe what's been said
No reason for existence, no purpose for lies
Meaning created, accept this truth and die
