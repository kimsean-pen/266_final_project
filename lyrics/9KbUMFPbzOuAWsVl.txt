And may you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold

Are you mean like a sweet and crazy brother to me
You know I love you like I should
And you never talk dirty behind my back
Know that there's ways who would

Oh please won't you, please won't you bear it in mind
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
And please won't you, please won't
You bear it in mind, just for me.

May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold

Are you're just like a sweet and simple sister to me
You know I love you like I should
You hold no blade to stab me in my back
You know that there's some of them that would

Oh please won't you, please won't you bear it in mind
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
And please won't you,
Please won't you bear it in mind for me.

May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold.

Are you mean like a sweet, crazy brother to me
I try to love you like I should
And you hold an old blade to stab me in my heart
And I know that there's some of them that would

Oh please won't you, please won't you bear it in mind
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
And please won't you, please won't you bear it in mind for me.

And may you never lose your temper
If you get in a bar room fight
May you never lose your lover overnight
May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold.

May you never lay your head down
May you never lay your head down
May you never lay your head down
May you never lay your head down
May you never lay your head down
