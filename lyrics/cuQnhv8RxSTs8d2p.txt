Isolated from the outside
Clouds have taken all the light
I have no control it seems my
Thoughts wander off

Of the time when I tried to
Live life without you

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride

If being myself is what I do wrong
Then I would rather not be right
Hopes turn into fear and with my
One wing I can't fly

With sunrise embrace my
Dreams tight and that's why

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride

Hoo

To a place without fear, with no moonlight
All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight
Where memories are being made and where the old one dies
Where love ain't lies

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
That's why birds don't fly
