With our minds gone
We can both ignore the feeling of our bodies open
With our eyes in the salt
We can only find the meaning of a God laid open

Peel it off
Let me go
Hold our heart out
Let this feeling show

With our hands down
We can only feel the rain upon our bodies solo
With our guides in tow
Only meaning of your voice is now a silent calling

Peel it off
Let me go
Hold our heart out
Let this feeling show

You feel
Let go of, let go of
My hand
You feel
Let go of, let go of
My hand
For so long, for so long
For so long, for so long
For so long, for so long
For so long, for so long
For so long, for so long
For so long, for so long
For so long, for so long
For so long, for so long
For so long, for so long
For so long, for so long
