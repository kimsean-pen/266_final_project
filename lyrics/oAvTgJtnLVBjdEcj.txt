I'll no longer hide it
Yes, you move me to tears
Over and over
Every time I get it settled, you excite it
Every time I get my face dry, you sing

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

Now I know, so now I no longer fight it
Come on in little floating head at the door
Who are you? Who are you
Who has come to fill my room
Well come on, welcome in

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

I'll no longer hide it
Yes, the way you say it stirs me to the core
Every time, no matter what
No matter who I think you are
Every time I hear you say undo I do
And the tears fall
And the universe is shown
But who are you, voice in headphones?
