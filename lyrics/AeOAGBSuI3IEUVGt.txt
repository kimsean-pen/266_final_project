I met you on the sidewalk
I hoped you were the way you were before
Don't give into the small talk
Don't give up on the things that we adore

Oh yes you know I'm like that
(?) the way we were before
Still got some things (?) at
These days just walk around here, Such a chore

We both need it all anew
Just the way were before
x2

I'm pleased to see that old walk
Skipping all the cracks on the concrete
These days have gotten real tough
(?) like you ever seemed
I've been around a few blocks
I chased away the cobwebs in the street
I wind up on the old (?)
So we can say we never skipped a beat

Cause we like that
Just like the way we were before
It's all made up
But that's just what we have in store

You can't fix that x4
