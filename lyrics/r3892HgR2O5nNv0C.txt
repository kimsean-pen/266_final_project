Hold tight
Now we're on our own
Cue lights
Now it's ready to roll
Tonight
How I've waited for
I've competed for years

It's fun
Oh I just can't wait
Hold on
Do I look up to date?
You're on
I'll do anything
If it's the right thing to see

Does it matter
What is shown?
Just as long as everyone knows
What is selling
What to buy
The stock market for your hi-fi

Take the money
Leave the box
Everybody's on Top Of The Pops

There's one
Born every day
Same song
Then they fade away
Ding-dong
What's the future in
The pop music industry?

All right
So you made the grade
Hold tight
To the buck you made
Just wait
You've been rated for
Constipated peak viewing time

Does it matter
What is shown?
Just as long as everyone knows
What's in fashion
What is scene
On the run of a television screen

Take the money
Leave the box
Everybody's on Top Of The Pops

Hold tight
Now we're on our own
Cue lights
Now it's ready to roll
Tonight
How I've waited for
I've competed for years

It's fun
Oh I just can't wait
Hold on
Do I look up to date?
You're on
I'll do anything
If it's the right thing to see

Does it matter
What is shown?
Just as long as everyone knows
What is selling
What to buy
The stock market for your hi-fi

Take the money
Leave the box
Everybody's on Top Of The Pops

Pay the money
Watch the box
Everybody's on Top Of The Pops

Everybody's on Top Of The Pops
Hey!
