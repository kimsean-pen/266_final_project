Feeling all sort of things
Feeling all sort of things
Feeling inside a simulation
Feeling all sort of things
Just feeling all sort of things
Being certain, inside her own mind

Human touch is all she needs it
Is it yours for the taking?
Human touch is all she needs it
Is it yours for the taking?
You are the warmth of nature

Seeing in sounds, feeling in fur
Speaking in house, tasting in nurse
I'll find you later,
I'll find you later
You won't mind and she won't mind
And it's a whole complication
It's the sense of human touch that gives us celebration!

You are the warmth of nature
You will be altered by broad

Human touch is all she needs it
Is it yours for the taking?
Human touch is all she needs it
Is it yours for the taking?
