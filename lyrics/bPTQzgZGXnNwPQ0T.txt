Head out to the unknown
With sincere dismay
Fear will direct you
Through the safest way

Never ask a question
Don't reveal a lie
Why should you bother?
When you can just pass right by?

Fate will take care of what to say
Fate will lead me to my decay

Fate betraying my trust
I can't resist it
I must

Give up when defeated
You'll never win a fight
Crimson red will stand out in the crowd
Where all is white

Though nobody bothers
If you suffocate
You know you can trust me
I am fate

Fate will take care of what to say
Fate will lead me to my decay
