Everyone waits by the corner of my bed until I'm out of my body to talk
I'm going to wait until you get out of work to see if you're thirsty or not
Brushed up on my arm
Couldn't sit closer
Play with your hair and then stop
Like you were the world's ugliest person that nobody wants to pick up

I know that you were sleeping in the car
I know that's when you put your legs against mine
I saw you in your high school picture

I know that I'm the tamest of boys
Why else would my voice be so soft
I feel you're something
I feel your sympathy
I don't feel anything at all

I'll touch you and you'll know I'm really bored
I'll call you when I'm cool enough to want you
You'll see me and you'll know you're sleeping

What would you do?

I was the caller so you answered the call
I was just restless
Like anxious and all
I want to feel you
I mean the real you
I'm under your skin
Like I want to be you

I was the caller so you answered the call
I was just restless
Like anxious and all
I want to feel you
I mean the real you
I'm under your skin
Like I want to be you

I was the caller so you answered the call
I was just restless
Like anxious and all
I want to feel you
I mean the real you
I'm under your skin
Like I want to be you

What would you do?
