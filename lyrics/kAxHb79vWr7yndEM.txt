Don't know what's come over me
Feels like I can't take the heat
It's hard to ignore all this pictures on my timeline
When it's really all I see

It's like why you going out so much
Like it's not already hard enough
How you taking all my love
Act like I'm not what you're thinking of

No time for complements but now I'm fishin'
On some type of drug, you my addiction
Like I only need you in addition
Tryna know whats up, yeah that's the mission

And no I ain't that type of guy, but for some reason
No, I just can't help myself
And now I just keep asking why
Why I'm thinking that you're out with someone else

I got henny in the freezer
Say you comin' through
Cause I hate it that I need ya
Know you feel it too

Say you comin' through
Cause I hate it that I need ya
Know you feel it too

Under influence and booze and liquor is the only time I'm coming through, yeah

Ay, how you manage what your plan is
Fucked around and got my heart around where your hand is
Ay, I been thinking hard and you got my head sprung
Ay, when I ain't got you these other bitches stand ins

Let's be honest
Talkin' about my money, girl you want it
Up to speed and now we supersonic
I know you've been thinking everything
Let's take a break from the gin 'n' tonic
I'll get the bottle and pour out the shots
Maybe the chemistry feeling the same
I know that you and I been through a lot
Send my location and you on the way, sheesh
