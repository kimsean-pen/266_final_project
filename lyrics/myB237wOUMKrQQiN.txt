Islands
Held together, only by accident
Water cuts, around the sun
We are sunset
Into me
Sinking in

While you're living out in your chemistry
Losing all your thoughts and your memories
Take another hour, let the weather pass
It's changing like the tide, like it always has
Rip currents surround me
To the rhythm of our melody
It's carving out our ship
As at the waves are coming in

Silence
Don't hide
Closes around us
A steady hand to calm the sand
And divide us
Birds song
Fading on

While you're living out in your chemistry
Losing all your thoughts and your memories
Take another hour, let the weather pass
It's changing like the tide, like it always has
Rip currents surround me
To the rhythm of our melody
It's carving out our ship
As at the waves are coming in

Come
The daylight in the room
And the sun gets in your eyes
The sun gets in your eyes
Come
The daylight in the room
And the sun gets in your eyes
The sun gets in your eyes
