The street is very wide
And I can't see across it
My house isn't clear to me
The cars move in between

And I say "Question:
When is a door not a door?"
And I say "That's not right!
Answer: When it's ajar!"

The numbers soft as soap
And tend to bend in addition
They're much too wan for me
I'd prefer some consistency

And I say "Question:
When is a door not a door?"
And I say "That's not right!
Answer: when it's ajar!"

The windows open wide
But I can't see out of it
The view is not very there
Sometimes I look for it

And I say "Question:
When is a door not a door?"
And I say "That's not right!
Answer: "When it's ajar!"
