Far, far away
In those city lights
The night
He's shining on you tonight

Far, far away from you
On the dark side
Of the moon

Well I long to hold you
In my arms and sway
Kiss and ride
On the CTA

I need to see you tonight
In those bright lights
Well, I'll know it's right

Deep in my heart
I'll know it's right

By the bed, by the light
That you read by
By the time
That I get home to say goodnight

I need to see you again
On the dark side, my friend
On the dark side
