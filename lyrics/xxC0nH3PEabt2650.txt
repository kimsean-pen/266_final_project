Gettin' edgy
All the time
Someone around me
Just a step behind
Kinds scary
The shape I'm in
Walls are shakin'
And they're closing in
Too fast or Bit too slow
Paranoid people
And starting to show
One guy that
I can't shake
Over my shoulder Is a big mistake
Sitting on the bed
Lying wide awake

Demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
Think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kind a weak
Sayin' all I know is
gotta get away from me
Tell you something

Just ain't right

My head is on loose
But my shoes are tight
Avoiding my friends
They are bug
Life like riddle And I'm really stumped
If you reason
Don't you know
prop preoccupation Is where you'll go
Bein' followed
Look around
It's only my shadow Creepin' on the ground
Sitting on the bed
I'm lying wide awake
Demons in my head

And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll

But I think it's kinda weak
Sayin' all I know is
I gotta get away from me
Gotta get away from me
Gotta get away from me
Whoa-oah-oah,
whoa-oah-oah

Whoa-oah-oah,
whoa-oah-oah

Sitting on the bed

I'm lying wide awake
Demons in my head

And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kinda weak
Sayin' all I know is
I gotta get away from me
Gotta get away from me
Gotta get away from me
Gotta get away from me...
