There's something cold and blank behind her smile
She's standing on an overpass in her miracle mile

'Cause you were from a perfect world
A world that threw me away today, today, today
To run away

A pill to make you numb
A pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself

Her mouth was an empty cut
She was waiting to fall
Just bleeding like a Polaroid
That lost all her dolls

'Cause you were from a perfect world
A world that threw me away today, today, today
To run away

A pill to make you numb
A pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself

A pill to make you numb
A pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself

You were from a perfect world
A world that threw me away today

A pill to make you numb
A pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself
A pill to make you numb
A pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself
