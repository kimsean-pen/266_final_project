I've called Persephone
By the name purse-a-phone
Greek goddesses aren't what
You grab when leaving home

My phone's inside my purse
Purse-a-phone would like it there
Like Hades' lair
I pray greek gods don't see me
Butchering names and not believing

But I'll mispronounce and mis-accent for infinity
There isn't much that you could do to stop me

Six pomegranate seeds, winter in Greece
Please don't visit me, Persephone

And I've said "protestant" just like pro-test-ant too
And it's not a word, let alone a church that you could send
Donations to

Who needs mistakes and stupid phrases that aren't real anyway?
If I'd a known I'd mess up this many times
Then I'd shut up for the rest of my life

But i'll mispronounce and mis-accent for infinity
There isn't much that you could do to stop me

Six pomegranate seeds, winter in Greece
Please don't visit, purse phone

What if i don't
Let them know that I don't know anything
Because I don't
Even know anything

But I'll mispronounce and mis-accent for infinity
There isn't much that you could do to stop me

Six pomegranate seeds, winter in Greece
Please don't visit me
Please don't visit

Hey I'll mispronounce and mis-accent for infinity
There isn't much that you could do to stop me

Six pomegranate seeds, winter in Greece
Please don't visit me
Please don't visit

I'll mispronounce and mis-accent for infinity
There isn't much that you could do to stop me

Six pomegranate seeds, winter in Greece
Please don't visit me, Persephenphone
