You don't have my number
We don't need each other now
We don't need the city
The creed or the culture now.
Cause I feel, I feel alive
I feel, I feel alive
I feel that the streets are all pulling me down.
So, people of the city
I don't need your counsel now
And I don't need your good advice
Cause you don't have my lover's touch.
You don't have my number
We don't need each other now
The creed or the culture
We can move beyond it now.
Now the wolf is knocking at my door
Bang, bang, it asks for more.
Stand here, we stand tall
We can move beyond these walls.
I don't need your counsel
I don't need these city streets
And I don't need that good advice
Cause we can move beyond it now.
You don't have my number
We don't need each other now
The creed or the culture
You don't have my lover's touch.
Cause I feel, I feel alive
I feel, I feel alive
I feel the streets are not far from here.
Do you even hear me?
Do you even know my name?
Can you see the ocean there?
You don't have my lover's touch.
(You don't have my number, love.)
And I wonder, can you hear me?
And are you even listening now?
Cause you don't have my number
We don't need each other now.
You can't steal my thunder
Cause you don't have my lover's touch.
You don't have my number
And I don't need no one now
And I don't need the city streets
The creed or the culture now.
