There's a river
In your eyes
When you quiver
When you cry

There's a rainbow
In your smile
When you're mellow
When you shine

You're my reason
In this wonderful life
A super weapon
For stopping the fight

You made it happen
It was love at first sight
In one vast second
You turned on the light yeah

You're my reason
In this wonderful life
A super weapon
For stopping the fight

You made it happen
It was love at first sight
In one vast second
You turned on the light

In my whole life
I've never felt so free
In my whole life
For the first time, I feel I can breath

In my whole life
I've never felt so free
For my whole life
You give me a reason to be

In my whole life
I've never felt so free
In my whole life
For the first time, I feel I can breath

In my whole life
I've never felt so free
For my whole life
You turned on the light, yeah
