An invitation to move away from
To crawl back inside back where we came from
But everyone's fine

A stormy outlook it keeps on coming, but I close my eyes
Dont know the difference between reality and what's inside
But everyone's fine

Fine as far as I know
And everyone's right, right as far as I know
And everyone's fine, fine as far as I know
Far as I know, far as I know

But everyone's fine
Fine as far as I know
And everyone's right, right as far as I know
And everyone's fine, fine as far as I know
Far as I know, far as I know
