I couldn't care less if the world's gone mad
I couldn't care less, wouldn't turn my head
I couldn't care less
I couldn't care less
The heart of the soul isn't touchable
Hard to hold on to what's beautiful There's no control
There's no control
When you talk about us, can you feel the fire in us
Do you ever miss? Would you ever miss
Through the darkness i swear, I can see your love in there
You never miss
You never miss
And i got a lesson learned, it's a lesson learned
Our love lives in a world of hurt
It's a lesson learned, and i feel burn
Our love lives in a world of hurt
I couldn't care less by the reasons why
I couldn't care less if it's wrong or wise
I couldn't care less
I couldn't care less
I wouldn't be here if it all made sense
Thought if i could only understand, it would hurt less
It would hurt less
When you talk about us, can you feel the fire in us
Do you ever miss? You never miss
Through the darkness i swear, i can see your love in there
You never miss
You never miss
And i got a lesson learned, It's a lesson learned
Our love lives in a world of hurt
It's a lesson learned, and i feel burn
Our love livea in a world of hurt
Don't wanna lead a heartless life
Don't wanna feel a numb inside
Don't wanna lead
Don't wanna lead
Don't wanna lead a heartless life
It's a lesson learned, it's a lesson learned
Love is in a world of hurt
HUURT
Our love is in a world of hurt ... hurt
Our love is in a world of hurt
