You've got what makes my heart beat faster
You've stripped all my defenses down
I know sometimes I'm a disaster
You take me as I am

And I love the way you get to me
Why don't we find out what it's really all about
Love's a mystery
Baby, you decipher me

Crack my code, crack my code
Crack my code, crack crack my code
Crack my code, crack my code
Baby, you decipher me

Crack my code, crack my code
Crack my code, crack crack my code
Crack my code, crack my code
Crack my code
Decipher me

You've got me twisted round your finger
I love the way you make me feel
You got me good, hook line and sinker
So take me as I am

And I love the way you get to me
Why don't we find out what it's really all about
Love's a mystery
Baby, you decipher me

Crack my code, crack my code
Crack my code, crack crack my code
Crack my code, crack my code
Baby, you decipher me

Crack my code, crack my code
Crack my code, crack crack my code
Crack my code, crack my code
Crack my code
Decipher me

Sugar, if you get to know me
We could get deep if you're one and only
Expert, I give you my testimony
Show me, and you could be the one to hold me

My system's elaborate, complex
Always gotta try to predict what comes next
It's complex, combinations to my master code
But honey, you could be the one to crack them all

And I love the way
I love, I love the way
I love the way that you decipher me
I love, I love the way
Baby, you decipher me
