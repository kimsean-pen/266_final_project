People.
Dancing shadows on a wall.
People.
Talking pictures on a wall.
(and they talk, and they talk, and they talk)
...and I can't breathe
there's no air in here at all.
Just too many people.
Here they come, to take it all.
People.
Smiling lips, and painted eyes.
People (people)
Endless words, and clever lies.
(and they talk, and they talk, and they talk, and they talk)
And they talk till I can't breathe.
There's no end to this at all.
Now I'm one of the people
here they come
to take it all.
Stop.
Hiding behind your face.
One of the endless people
hiding behind a face.
Stop.
Hiding behind your face.
One of the endless people
hiding behind a face.
stop
Stop.
