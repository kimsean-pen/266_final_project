We said tonight
No going back (whoa, whoa)
Nothing seems right
Stuck in the past (whoa, whoa)
遠回りも寄り道も (whoa)
すべてのことに意味があって (whoa, whoa)
空回りもその痛みも
When am I, when am I gonna stop this dreaming?
When I was king (I was king)
We had everything
When am I when am I gonna start living?
When I was king (I was king)
We had everything
When am I when am I gonna start living?
Don't wanna go
I'm holding on tight (wow, wow)
Something to live for make it our nights
(Shut down the sirens in our heads)
When I was king (I was king)
We had everything
When am I when am I gonna start living?
When I was king (I was king)
We had everything
When am I when am I gonna start living?
Yeah, I was king (I was king, I was king, I was king)
If I go down, I will go down fighting
I'll go down, down like lightning
If I go down, I will go down fighting
I'll go down, down like lightning
If I go down, I will go down fighting
I'll go down, down like lightning
I was king
When am I when am I gonna start living? (wow)
When am I when am I gonna move on? (wow, wow)
When am I when am I gonna kill this feeling? (wow)
When am I when am I gonna stop this dreaming?
When I was king (I was king)
When I was king
When I was king (I was king)
We had everything
When am I when am I gonna start living?
Yeah, I was king
