I gave my strength.

For years like an ox I pushed,
and for years like a ship I sank
to the bottom of that unknown sea.

I'm still learning to be free and not so somber.
Every night I stay up a little longer
searching on that field of stars.

Do you know who you are?
Can you dig up my tree?
Can you find what's inside of me?
Find the origin of my defeat.

In the beginning
I was all dreams
Times have changed—
I'm no longer the same

I don't want you to leave.
It's so bittersweet that this is the time you met me;
I'm going through a long phase:

I don't try to relate,
I don't really try to find someone to sedate me.
Hard out for remedy, it's so bittersweet (you and me).

In the beginning
I was all dreams
Times have changed—
I'm no longer the same

Every day's a lesson in giving away.
Stripes on my floor, dark shots at my door.
Have you ever walked in on a queen before?

I just went through the valley,
(I know it's changed me)
fire from eternity, the origin of my dreams.

In the beginning
I was all dreams.
Time caught up with me
and I can finally see.
