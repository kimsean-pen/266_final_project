See, it doesn't matter where we all go
It doesn't matter is the same road
Hits naturally

Tonight, I got another confession for you
It's alright but don't you see
When you're near I get weak in my knees
Tonight, I need a little more space for me
You're alright but don't you see
When you're near I can barely breathe

See, it doesn't matter where we all go
It doesn't matter if the same road
Hits naturally, yeah, yeah
Breathe for all the promises we do break
And all the feelings that we can't shake
Come naturally

Tonight, we'll be the craziest they've ever seen
It's okay, as long as we
Keep living a dream in a dream
Tonight, you'll be the one that is meant for me
That's okay, as long as we
Keep facing reality

See, it doesn't matter where we all go
It doesn't matter if the same road
Hit naturally, yeah, yeah
Breathe for all the promises we do break
All the feelings that we can't shake
Come naturally

I wasted so much time on you
