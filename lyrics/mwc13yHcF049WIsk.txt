Took you down to a little place by the river
Going down down down down down
Did you played with my heart like it's nothing but water?!
Falling down down down down

So help me
It's moving faster than ever
Second is another way to remember
Going down down down down down
Going down down down down down

And it all comes down to YOU
And it all comes down to YOU

Silence is where the time is forgotten
It's movements you won't last
Going down down down down down
Going down down down down down

And it all comes down to YOU
And it all comes down to YOU

And it all comes down to YOU
And it all comes down to YOU
