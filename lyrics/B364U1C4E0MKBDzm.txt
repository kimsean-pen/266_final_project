I've carried a weight a very long time
like a black stone, a hopeless crime
Past the fields, past the towns
I've measured hills and dales
Up and down

If I rest I am sure you are there waiting
for my mind to break down
and your soul to take control

I am here, I'm not going down
I will carry on to do what I must do
To see the truth behind your whispering lies
I am not yours to take down

I covered my face in the darkest night
Changed my name and foolish hopes
You are still lingering here in every thought
Still myself and still yours

If I rest I am sure you are there waiting
for my mind to break down
and your soul to take control

I am here, I'm not going down
I will carry on to do what I must do
To see the truth behind your whispering lies
I am not yours to take down

Someday I'll turn my head around
and I'll look you straight in the eye
You are all I fear for you are all I love,
my decay.

Here, I'm not going down
I will carry on to do what I must do
To see the truth behind your whispering lies
I am not yours to take down

Here, I'm not going down
I will carry on, to do what I must do
To see the truth behind your lies
I'm not yours!
