Alright, Gambino is a mastermind, fuck a bitch to pass the time
Mass Appeal, orange rind
Smoke your green, I'm spending mine
The beat is witches brew, but beware this shit is potent
E.E. cumming on her face, now that's poetry in motion
Yeah, Gambino make it work, I'm the boss move something
Yeah, this cool fuckin' suits me, the swag two button
Yeah, these girls be acting crazy when they're dancing, Black Swan
I ain't fuckin' at the club, put your clothes back on
This beat is a disaster, 9/11 this track
Rappers wanna battle me, I have to mail their heads back
And my clique make that dinero, so its time to meet the fuckers
I am runnin' this bitch, you are just a dog walker
Leavin' with yo girl when we last seen each other
Yeah, you fucking with the baddest like we tag team Rihanna
Fly girl on her knees, she don't wanna come near me
My dick is too big, there's a big bang theory
Got her picture in my iPhone, what do y'all think?
While y'all niggas masturbate, I'm in that Ariel Pink
If I am just a rapper, man, you could've fooled me
I'm the shit, when these dudes talk, they talkin' bull me

Alright I'm down with the black girls of every single culture
Filipino, Armenian girls on my sofa
Yeah I like the white girls, some times we get together
Need a thick chick, though, so it's black and yellow, black and yellow
Love is a trip, but fucking is a sport
Are there Asian girls here? Minority Report
Put your team on the map, Blake Griffin on the court
Niggas bitin' off my tracks, need a knife and a fork
We the illest, need a nurse
Here's the cheque, grab your purse
Unless we fuckin', then I'll pay for all the food on the earth
I got some pussy that was insane
So insane, it's an enemy of Batman
I'm dominant, niggas call me faggot cause they closeted, I'm hot as shit
Coming out of the backside of a rocket ship
It's Monster shit
You dude's are the opposite of Lochnesses
Respond to this, we can squash the beef right now like sausages
Chillin with my n-words, say it like a white kid
Yes your booty's big as hers, say that to my white bitch
So she don't get embarrassed
My dick is made of carrots
Bunnies wantin' to be fed, and I meant honeys, Oh forget it
I have worked all Winter, I will not fail Summer
In the back of the bush, like Gavin Rossdale's drummer
Yeah, my stinger's in her flower, I hope she lets me pollenate
Working hard as shit, yeah, this beat is made from concentrate
Nigga can't you tell that my sample of Adele
Was so hot, I got these hood niggas blowin up my cell?
Swag out the ass, I'm the man, fuck chico
Took the G out yo waffle, all you got left is your ego
Think about it for a second
Man we eating, where's your breakfast?
Man, you hungry have this sandwich
Got my wallet, Cheese and Lettuce
An elephant never forgets, so my dick remembers everything
Green inside your wallet is that pussy open sesame
Runnin' the game, fuck am I sayin'
Runnin' the earth, Give me a month
Told all you niggas I'm in it to win it
Cause havin' an Emmy just wasn't enough
You get sloppy drunk, I stay whiskey neat
My clique should be cancelled... Freaks and Geeks
