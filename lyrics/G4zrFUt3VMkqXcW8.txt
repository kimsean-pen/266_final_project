I don't know what to say
I hear this all the time
If it's ever gonna get in the way
I'll hide it down below

I like you how you are
Doesn't matter if you take it too far
It's how we're meant to begin
Oh, keep me in your flame
Or burn me it's the same
We're never gonna win

I don't want to say goodbye
'Cause I need you in my life
Painting pictures in my head
All the pretty things you said

Things don't go my way
I feel this all the time
I can't believe your friends
They say they're on your side
Don't know why

If karma's on your mind
I need to learn to find
A new way out of here
Oh back to where we start
I feel nothing in my heart
It's time to disappear

I don't want to say goodbye
'Cause I need you in my life
Painting pictures in my head
All the pretty things you said

All I ask is for you to be there
By my side
By my side

Everytime I, I swear
All I'm supposed to do is be myself
I try to change, but I
Don't know how
It's just the way it goes for us right now

I don't want to say goodbye
'Cause I need you in my life
Painting pictures in my head
All the pretty things you said
