(new surroundings)
My dreams will never come true
and if they ever ever do
there's never you
I want to implode
I want it to end
and all those old feelings are coming back again

(new surroundings)

My dreams are haunting my soul
and when I'm driving down the road
I'm not in control
I want to let go
I want to shake hands
with the person that's
responsible for this master plan

I know I will
I know I can

(new surroundings)
(this is not in your mind)

my dreams will never come true
and if they ever ever do
it's never you
