Long long way to the top
long way down if you fall
it's a long way back
if you get lost

Long way out to the air
It's a long way to go
to lose your friends
It's a long way to haul
all the traps you've trawled
when you could just stop and let go

And you say not now, maybe later
but not now, maybe later
but not now, maybe later
(you're only in your way)
but not now, maybe later
(you're only in your way)
maybe... wait...

'Cause love is tough
when enough is not enough
it's not enough...
not enough...
it's not enough
not enough
not enough
not enough
not enough
not enough
not enough
not enough
not enough
not enough
not enough
not enough
not enough...

Not enough
not enough...
