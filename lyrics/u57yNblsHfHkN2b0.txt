Yeah, she is
I confess
I fell from one trap to the next
I fell from one trap to the next
I close my eyes, see the same things
Look away
I can always recognize it
but I ...that it means

Yeah, she is
I confess
I only have one life to forgive
May not be real dreams with them all you get
In the wilderness I know, there's something so familiar
Something I cannot control
Something I cannot control

I fell from one trap...
I fell from one trap...
I fell from one trap...
I fell from one trap...
