A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine
(Doo-doo-d'n doo)
(Doo-doo-d'n doo)

I dream of your
First kiss and then
I feel upon
My lips again

A taste of honey
(A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

Oh, I will return
Yes, I will return
I'll come back
For the honey and you
(Doo-doo-d'n doo)
(Doo-doo-d'n doo)

Yours was the kiss
That awoke my heart
There lingers still
Though we're far apart

That taste of honey
(A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

Oh, I will return
Yes, I will return
I'll come back
(He'll come back)
For the honey
(For the honey)
And you
