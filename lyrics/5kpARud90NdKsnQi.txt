Forget me, Forget me not
Was a lot, Hurts a lot
I was blown away when you left
I lose time with this dream that I follow

When you sit next to me
I fell off, I fell down
The stars could change direction for you
Hurts a lot, Hurts a lot

Oh Sympathy, I understand
An Empty Heart, An Empty Hand
If I could break your heart of stone,
Would you be mine, Would you be mine?

When you disappeared, I cried
Not my fault, Not my loss
Still I search the Seven Stars for your Love
It's a dream that I follow

Forget me, Forget me not
Hurts a lot, Hurts a lot
The wind could blow you back to me in some time
Dazzle me with your smile

Oh Sympathy, I understand
An Empty heart, An Empty hand
If I could break your heart of stone
Would you be mine, Would you be mine?

Oh Sympathy, You're much too cold
Now I feel bad, Now I feel bad
If I could break your heart of stone,
Would you be mine, Would you be mine?

Christina could you just forget my love?
Christina could you just forget my name?
Christina could you just forget my love?
Christina could you just forget my name?
Christina could you just forget my love?
Christina could you just forget my name?
Christina could you just forget my love?
Christina was it only just a fantasy?
