Bobby took me down to the shore yesterday.
he pointed at the ocean and said "can't you fucking see?"
and I said "sure, what's in it for me?"

natural devotion.

If we held hands for too long i'd worry people might stare.
but bobby passed away last week.
I bet he never cared.

now I live all alone.
I disguise my voice on the phone.

why, on the side of the road,
I confess my worries unknown?

natural devotion.

[if someone had asked me fifteen years ago to imagine what Hell
feels like,
it would have felt a lot like Me in (indiscernible) Right Now]

August
came and went so quick
I'm all missed.

I guess.
I guess we're burning up in fox piss.
