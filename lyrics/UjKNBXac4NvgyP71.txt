When there's no comfort in comfortable
The stolen chances and colored cars
You can invest with your full heart
You feel it crumble before you start

The path you didn't take, it always ends
Perfect only 'cause you never did
The moments that we have will soon be gone
Either you're here or you're not
You're here or you're not

The floating fire is hard to hold
Our fingers pass right through its glow
There's peace out there somewhere in time
But I'm as real as you will find

The path you didn't take, it always ends
Perfect only 'cause you never did
The moment that we have is almost gone
Either you're here or you're not
Either you're here or you're not

The path you didn't take, it always ends
Perfect only 'cause you never did
The moment that we have is almost gone
Either you're here or you're not
Either you're here or you're not
