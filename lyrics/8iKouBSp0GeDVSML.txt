Return to earth
faint and dark illuminating light
to grant rebirth
under somber shade of starless night
sweeping darkness surge
reveal all within what you hide
blood moon converge feel me in along with your tide
resonating first breath
like hungered wolves howling into the hollow
generate un-death
escape the womb and blindly follow
revolution is the flame
answered prayers unto Apollo
tread against the grain
your light is what the night will swallow
prevail through sacrifice
and stand before the all seeing eyes
lawless flame we ignite
beyond bleakest pitch, transcendence burning bright
