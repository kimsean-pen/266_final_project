Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?
Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?
(1, 2 - 1, 2, 3 go)

Will I be more than flesh?
Can I leave more than bones?
But cannot be cut into stone
Force yourself to remember
Or choose to forget
You can't leave this world as a lion

We break like the ocean, we rise like the tide
We drown in emotion but reach for the sky
We're moving the mountains, we're making a change
Drink youth from the fountain before it's too late
Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?
Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?

Will I leave you better off than I found you?
Shining every step
Or will I deceive you, mislead, and destroy you
The choice is up to me

We break like the ocean, we rise like the tide
We drown in emotion but reach for the sky
We're moving the mountains, we're making a change
Drink youth from the fountain before it's too late
Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?
Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?

Who will we leave in our wake?
Yeah

We break like the ocean, we rise like the tide
We drown in emotion but reach for the sky
We're moving the mountains, we're making a change
Drink youth from the fountain before it's too late
Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?
Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?
Who will we leave in our wake?
