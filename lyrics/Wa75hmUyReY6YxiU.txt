No I donÂ't need a reason to be breathin, just give you what I can
No I donÂ't want a family who would dare me to resent everything I am
I donÂ't need to prove to all the ones who feel that I need to fit in
No I donÂ't ever tell you that I failed you, IÂ'd rather start life over again
No IÂ'm sorry to say thereÂ'll be no sacrifice today

Now I can see it clearly why you fear me why you gotta bring me down
No I donÂ't wanna fight you just to spite you but IÂ'm not afraid to take you out
No IÂ'm sorry to say thereÂ'll be no sacrifice today

Everybody expects me to break but IÂ'll never breakdown again
Everybody expects me to give up, but youÂ'll never see me givin in
Everybody wants me to lose, but IÂ'll never lose who I am
No IÂ'm sorry to say thereÂ'll be no sacrifice today

No IÂ'm sorry to say thereÂ'll be no sacrifice today

Everybody expects me to break but IÂ'll never breakdown again
Everybody expects me to give up, but youÂ'll never see me givin in
Everybody wants me to lose, but IÂ'll never lose who I am
No IÂ'm sorry to say thereÂ'll be no sacrifice today
No IÂ'm sorry to say thereÂ'll be no sacrifice today

No IÂ'm sorry to say thereÂ'll be no sacrifice today
No IÂ'm sorry to say thereÂ'll be no sacrifice today
