Are we
Down for the same cause?
We don't know what we stand for
When the moments start to crack
You do lose track where your head's at

And I am unreachable
What do you think when your head's full?
We don't rely on what we get
We begin now where we aren't yet

One time, hit me where I turn white
I don't mean to be polite
Uniform
Spinning in the world to the beat of my drums
Uniform

One time, hit me where I turn white
I don't mean to be polite
Uniform
Spinning in the world to the beat of my drums
Uniform

Reach into the darkness for what you can find
Travel great distance in your mind
The world gets stronger as you start trying
Things turn around towards being born
Away from dying

I've lost my kin
There's no one on my side
Were we to disappear
Well, I'd know I tried
You know I tried
You know we tried
End
Shoot me
End
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
