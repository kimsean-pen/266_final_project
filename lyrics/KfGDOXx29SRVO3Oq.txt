Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh
White cliffs coming to a raging sea
Riptide's gonna push the life of me
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
When you're gone

Beachy Head
They're not dead
They saw the waves below
That's no way to go

White cliffs coming to a raging sea
Riptide's gonna push the life of me
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
When you're gone

Beachy Head
They're not dead
They saw the waves below
That's no way to go
