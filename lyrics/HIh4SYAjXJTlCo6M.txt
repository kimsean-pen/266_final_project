You want my love, take it all
You wanna watch it all come off, take it all
Come on now show me how, you take it all

You want my glove, are you enthralled?
You wanna see it slip away and watch it fall
Oh, we know it's your show, so take it all

You want the movement to see what the hips can do
Come, watch the slinky girl, see how the pasties twirl
To make your bells all ring fulfilling everything you ever wanted

So go ahead, take it all
You want my soul, take it all
It's time to leave, if I'm to live
Because I have no more, there's nothing left to give

I watch you rise, I watch you fall
While I am standing with my back against the wall
Now it's your turn to finally learn
You had the world, you had your fling
You wanted more than everything

You got your wish, you got your prize
Now take it right between your thighs
You grabbed for everything, my friend
But don't you see that in the end there will be nothing left of me
