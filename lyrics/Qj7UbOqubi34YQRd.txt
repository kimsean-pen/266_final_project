Bill, I love you so, I always will
I look at you and I see the passion, eyes of May
(Eyes of May)
Oh, but am I ever gonna see my wedding day?
(Wedding day)

Oh, I was on your side Bill
(When you were losing)
When you were losing
I'd never scheme or lie Bill, there's been no fooling
But kisses and love won't carry me till you marry me Bill
(Till you marry me Bill)

I love you so, I always will
And in your voice I hear a choir of carousels
Oh, but am I ever gonna hear my wedding bells?
(Wedding bells)

I was the one came running
(When you were lonely)
When you were lonely
I haven't lived one day not loving you only
But kisses and love won't carry me, till you marry me Bill
(Till you marry me Bill)
I've got the wedding bell blues
(Got the wedding bell blues)

Come on marry me Bill
(Till you marry me Bill)
I've got the wedding bell blues
(Got the wedding bell blues)
Come on marry me Bill
(Till you marry me Bill)
I've got the wedding bell blues
(Got the wedding bell blues)
