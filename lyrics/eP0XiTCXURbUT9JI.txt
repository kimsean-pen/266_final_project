One two three four five six seven eight

I don't wanna be a number
Just like being a prisoner
I just wanna stay free
Don't wanna be a number three

Oh, I don't wanna be no
One two three four five six seven eight

Signing on the dot
Got my name on a form
Thought I had it made
They treat you just insane

Oh, I don't wanna be no
One two three four five six seven eight

You are just a number
And I ain't got a name
You are just a number
And I ain't got a name

Sitting in a prison cell
Numbers on my chest
Age is just a number
Mummy does know best

Oh, I don't wanna be no
One two three four five six seven eight

You are just a number
And I ain't got a name
You are just a number
And I ain't got a name

I don't wanna be a number
Just like being a prisoner
I just wanna stay free
Don't wanna be a number three

Oh, I don't wanna be no
One two three four five six seven eight

You are just a number
And I ain't got a name
You are just a number
And I ain't got a name

One two three four five six seven eight
