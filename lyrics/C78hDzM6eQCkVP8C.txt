I bit my tongue in the awkward conversation
I met you once and I'd fallen for your notions.
Do you believe that there's treasures in the ocean
I don't know why.
I don't know why.
Girl you make me want to feel,
Things I've never felt before.
Girl you make me want to feel,
Did I say I'm just a boy,
Did I say I'm just a boy,
No lonely hands grab my suitcase full of nothing
I don't know why
I don't know why
You took me in gave me something to believe in
I don't know why.
I don't know why.
Girl you make me want to feel
Things I never felt before
Girl you make me want to feel
Did I say I'm just a boy
Did I say I'm just a boy
Did I say I'm just a boy
Did I say I'm just a boy
