I wanna love you
And treat you right, I wanna love you
Every day and every night, we'll be together
With a roof upon our heads, we'll share the shelter
Of my single bed, we'll share the same room, yeah
For Jah provide the bread
Is this love, is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love, is this love that I'm feelin'
I wanna know, wanna know now
I got to know, got to know now

I, I'm willing and able
So I throw my cards on your table
I wanna love you

I wanna love and treat you right, I wanna love you
Every day and every night, we'll be together
With a roof upon our heads, we'll share the shelter
Of my single bed, we'll share the same room, yeah
For Jah provide the bread
