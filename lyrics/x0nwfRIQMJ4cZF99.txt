He sold out both his eyes,
yet sees her face,
her thighs in lace,
oh, why such waste?
Ghosts are only negative space,
ancestors, no blood,
no place, no mark,
just voices, in the dark.
The floor, is covered in champagne,
the leather and the blood, and all the sudden rain.
Man, you should' ve seen those cops baptise,
the worst case scenario, survival game.
