My darling souls
Look deep into the eyes of the soul that sits across the room
And start to recognize their face
They'll start to recognize yours too
Reunited friends and family
Your souls I've gathered here

Oh no you mustn't fear

It's time now to transcend
And start another journey
Or go back to amend the life you lived before
You know it's always been up to you
So now it's time for you to choose
