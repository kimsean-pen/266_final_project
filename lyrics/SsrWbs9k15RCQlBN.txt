I got a baby that's all so pretty
(Pretty-diddy-dum, dum-dum, did-didley)
I found her right here in the Windy City
(Diddly-diddy-dum, dum-dum, did-didley)

Somebody kissed my baby last night
(Diddly-diddy-dum, dum-dum, did-didley)
Well, my pretty baby cried
She know it wadn't right
(Diddly-diddy-dum, dum-dum, did-didely)

Well, my baby started to cry in vain
(Diddly-diddy-dum, dum-dum, did-didley)
Say, 'Bo Diddle, you know you a nat'ral born man'
(Diddly-diddy-dum, dum-dum, did-didley)

I say, 'I love you baby with all my heart'
(Diddly-diddy-dum, dum-dum, did-didley)
Please, don't never say we'll part
(Diddly-diddy-dum, dum-dum, did-didley)

(Diddly-diddy-dum, dum-dum, did-didley)
I wanna know if you do love me
