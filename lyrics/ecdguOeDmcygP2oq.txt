What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy

And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those days for takin' a walk outside
I'm blowin' the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face on somebody's new-mowed lawn

I've been havin' a sweet dream
I been dreamin' since I woke up today
It's starrin' me and my sweet thing
'Cause she's the one makes me feel this way

And even if time is passin' me by a lot
I couldn't care less about the dues you say I got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for droppin' my load
A pie in the face for bein' a sleepy bull toad

And you can be sure that if you're feelin' right
A daydream will last long into the night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may prick up your ears
Or you may be daydreamin' for a thousand years

What a day for a daydream
Custom-made for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy
