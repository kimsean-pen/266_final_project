I was not created
In the likeness of a fraud
Your hell is something scary
I prefer a loving god

We are not the center
Of this funny universe
And what is worse
I do not serve in fear of such a curse

Shallow be thy game
2000 years look in the mirror
You play the game of shame
You tell your people live in fear

A rival to the way you see
The Bible let him be
I'm a threat to your survival
And your control company

You'll never burn me
You'll never burn me
I will be your heretic and
You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody

(Now pray)
(Now pray)
(Now pray)
(Now pray)

To anyone who's listening
You're not born into sin
The guilt they try and give you
Puke it in the nearest bin

Missionary madness
Sweep up culture with a broom
Trashing ancient ways
Is par for the course
It's fucking rude

To think that you're above
The laws of nature what a joke, oh
Purple sashes feeding masses
Smoke on which to choke

I might be a monkey
When it comes to being holy
Fundamental hatred
Get down on your knees and

You'll never burn me
You'll never burn me
I will be your heretic and
You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody
Oh, yeah!

I was not created
In the likeness of a fraud
Your hell is something scary
I prefer a loving god

We are not the center
Of this funny universe
And what is worse
I do not serve in fear of such a

You'll never burn me
You'll never burn me
I will be your heretic and
You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody

You'll never burn me
You'll never burn me
I will be your heretic and
You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody
