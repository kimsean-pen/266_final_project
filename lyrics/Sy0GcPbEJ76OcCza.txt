Even when you thought you had me beat,
I still found the strength, hidden deep within me.
And I can't, can't ever lose my voice.
I learned how to block, block out all of the noise.
I found my place.
In the empty spaces where my demons lay.
No I don't believe that we as humans were meant to be afraid.
I wear these scars!
I own my mistakes, you made me this way.
I wear these scars!
I know my mistakes, you can't take that away.
I wear these scars.
You made me this way!
I wear these scars.
You can't take that away!
It's so strange that I ended up here.
I never thought I'd make it through these years.
I found my place.
In the empty spaces where my demons lay.
No I don't believe that we as humans were meant to be enslaved.
I wear these scars!
I own my mistakes, you made me this way.
I wear these scars!
I know my mistakes, you can't take that away.
I wear these scars.
You made me this way!
I wear these scars.
You can't take that away!
Most of these scars will fade away.
But nothing hides the fact that you were my mistake.
I wear these scars!
I own my mistakes, you made me this way.
I wear these scars!
I know my mistakes, you can't take that away.
I wear these scars.
You made me this way.
I wear these scars. I wear these scars.
You can't take that away!
I don't believe that we're defined by our mistakes.
And I can see that you think you've had all you can take.
I won't believe that we're defined by our mistakes.
I hope you see that, you're better off this way!
