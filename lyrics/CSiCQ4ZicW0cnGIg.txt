Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Said you didn't have a clue
Taking pictures off the walls
Knocking on your neighbor's house
Oh my god

I said that I don't even wanna be here now, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Said you didn't have a clue
Taking pictures off the walls
Knocking on your neighbor's house
Oh my god

I said that I don't even wanna be here now, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh
