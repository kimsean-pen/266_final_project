So this is how it goes?
Well I, I would have never known
And if it ends today
Well I'll still say that you shine brighter than anyone

Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know
That it's not this hard?
Well it's not this hard
But, you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please not this time
No, not this time

Well this is not your fault
But if I'm without you then I will feel so small
And if you have to go
Well always know that you shine brighter
Than anyone does

Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know
That it's not this hard?
Well it's not this hard
But, if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please not this time
No, not this time

If you run away now
Will you come
Back around

And if you ran away
I'd still wave goodbye
Watching you shine bright

Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know
That it's not this hard?
Well it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please not this time
No, not this time
And I'll wave goodbye watching you shine bright
And I'll wave goodbye tonight
