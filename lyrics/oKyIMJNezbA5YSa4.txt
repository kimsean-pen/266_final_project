Nori!
It all started when we first met
And strapped on our guitars
We made music so great and cool
That soon we were rock stars

The biggest in Japan
(sonai kutanai)
With tons of screaming fans
(ama a-geme)
We're out on tour around the world
So can and join the band
(five, four, three!)

Hi hi puffy amiyumi show!
On the hi hi puffy amiyumi show
Anything is possible

Hi hi puffy amiyumi show!
On the hi hi puffy amiyumi show
Anything is possible now!

Put your bag in the back, let's go
We got some gigs to play
With the stage and microphone
We rock hard everyday
prague to nyc
Concerts and tv
Let's hit the road
we'll rock the globe
with songs to sing
(dos, tres, cuatro!)

Hi hi puffy amiyumi show!
On the hi hi puffy amiyumi show
Anything is possible
Hi hi puffy amiyumi show!
On the hi hi puffy amiyumi show
Anything is possible

Packed halls, strip malls,
Paparazzi, flash bulbs,
Cool clothes, videos,
Every night a rock show,
Onstage, backstage,
After party, every night!
Big fun, hit and run,
Tokyo to London,
New tunes, old tunes,
Animated cartoon life!

Hi hi puffy amiyumi show!
On the hi hi puffy amiyumi show
Anything is possible
Hi hi puffy amiyumi show!
Hi hi puffy amiyumi sanjo!
Hi hi puffy amiyumi show!
Anything is possible
With rock so powerful
Make yourself comfortable now!
