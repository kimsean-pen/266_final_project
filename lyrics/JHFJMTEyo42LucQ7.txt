I wish I could wake up by the ocean
Where the waves are breakin'
I wish I could wake up on the mountains
Where the snow keeps fallin'
I wish I could wake up in the jungle
Where the skies always blue
I wish I could wake up anywhere
As long as I'm with you
Ooo ooo I'm with you

I wish I could wake up in the desert
As far as I could see
I'd do anything that I want
With no one watching me
Wish I could wake up
In a world where hope is coming soon
I wish I could wake up anywhere
As long as I'm with you
Ooo ooo I'm with you

I wish I could wake up and all my pain
Was water off my back
No sense in holding on to little things
Lost along the track
Wish I could wake up just the two of us
With nothing much to do
Wish I was anywhere, I don't care
As long as I'm with you
Ooo ooo 'cause I'm with you

I'm with you
I'm with you
Ooo ooo 'cause I'm with you

I wish I could wake up by the ocean
Where the waves are breakin'
I wish I could wake up on the mountains
Where the snow keeps fallin'
I wish I could wake up in the jungle
Where the skies always blue
Wish I could wake up anywhere
As long as I'm with you
Ooo ooo 'cause I'm with you
