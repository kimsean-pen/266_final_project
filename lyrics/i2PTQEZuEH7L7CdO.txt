Snap backs and levi jeans,
pbr and burnt CDs
Running for the grass on the hot concrete
Still working on our summer feet

Cheap gas and ready ice,
Trunk music and headlight fights
Dodging smoke from a riverbank fire
Pretty girl and a pickup line like
"Hey what's your name, you know smoke follows beauty baby"
We stayed up all night long
Made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water
In the middle of the night
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in
Stompin' in the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it

Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it

Car wash at the custom tent
Sticky quarters and pine tree scent
The only sign that we ever got stuck

Is the muddy chain in the back of the truck 5-1's with a 20 on top
Three guard at the barber shop
Duckin' from your ex at the 4 way stop
Turn the music down when you're passing the cops

We stayed up all night long
Made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water
In the middle of the night
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in
Stompin' in the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it

Mama's prayer and daddy's speech
Front porch philosophies
A Little too young and dumb to see
Just what it all meant to me

We stayed up all night long
Made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water
In the middle of the night
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in
Stompin' in the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it
