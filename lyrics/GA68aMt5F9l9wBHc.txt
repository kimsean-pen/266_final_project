They said since the death
Your absence has been noticed
And there's nothing that I don't owe the past

Sagan-Indiana
Never saw what she was named after
Fall of the future
Back to me
Back to me
Back to me

There's a man fueling my petrol tank
All to feed his children on Christmas day
I'm avoiding seeing my family
And I buried my heart
Comfortable stranger
The last thing she said
Was "don't go digging up the dead"

Sagan-Indiana
Never saw what she was named after
Fall of the future
Back to me
Back to me
Back to me

She said her house was like her friend
Keep the lights on and the stereo going
While they were mapping out the world
She was inside taking care of herself

Sagan-Indiana
Never saw what she was named after
Said it didn't matter
I found me
I found me
I found me
I found me
I found me
