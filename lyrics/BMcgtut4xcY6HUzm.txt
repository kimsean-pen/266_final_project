Turn out the lights.
Just say goodnight
To yourself.
May I remind you
When you find you
Are all alone's when you've
Got to be strong.
That's when they call you
In the night.
He's got your picture
In his mind.
He's got your number
On a paper
At his disposal
Anytime.

Is he really true?
Could you save yourself
For someone who
Could love you for you?
So many times
We just give it away
To someone who,
Someone who,

You met in a bar.
The back of a car.
And for a moment
You felt important
But not in your heart.
'Cause my self esteem -
It's been low.
Go ahaed and count.
It's been lower than low.
I know the feeling
Of it stealing
Right out from under me.

'Cause I wanna learn -
How you save yourself
For someone who
Could love you for you.
So many times
We just give it away
To someone who
Can't even remember your name
Could you save yourself
For someone who
Loves you for you?
Loves me for me?
Give it away
To someone who
Someone who
Will cherish your name.

'Cause I wanna learn.
Could you save yourself
For someone who
Loves you for you?
And loves me for me?
Give it away
To someone who,
Someone who'll
Cherish your name...
Cherish your name...
