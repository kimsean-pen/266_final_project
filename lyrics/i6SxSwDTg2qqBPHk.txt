True, you ride the finest horse I've ever seen
Standing sixteen, one or two
with eyes wide and green
And you ride the horse so well
hands light to the touch
I could never go with you
no matter how I wanted to.

Ride on, see you
I could never go with you
No matter how I wanted to.

Ride on, see you
I could never go with you
No matter how I wanted to.

When you ride into the night
without a trace behind
Run your claw along my gut, one last time.
I turn to face an empty space
where you used to lie
And look for a spark to light the night
through a teardrop in my eye.

Ride on, see you
I could never go with you
No matter how I wanted to.

Ride on, see you
I could never go with you
No matter how I wanted to.

Ride on, see you
I could never go with you
No matter how I wanted to.

Ride on, see you
I could never go with you
No matter how I wanted to.

Ride on, see you
I could never go with you
No matter how I wanted to.
