Distracting our minds
Make us all feel we're fine
Changing our ways and make us feel less
Cause you're using your brains
And you're using our homes
To make us lose our senses in useless things

Money for reason
Is not in your head
More isn't enough
Just gaining wealth
We're calling you treason
You make us feel lead
You think we're just glad we're all having our health

Sometimes,
We got to get up,
And break down the system,
That's keeping us down

Play that god that we all should serve
Your gold is our souls
And it's tearing up holes
Why is our loved ones
Stuck in your madness
Try to get away when we open our eyes

Sometimes,
We got to get up,
And break down the system,
That's keeping us down

Sometimes,
We got to wake up,
And realize that this isn't right

What makes you think that
You have the right
To impoverish the suns
That we all should share

Because who was
Who were the first
To put up fences
And claim land for their own

Sometimes,
We got to get up,
And break down the system,
That's keeping us down

Sometimes,
We got to wake up,
And realize that this isn't right

You take us for fools
But what do you see?
Cause the way that you rule
Is just tyranny

You take us for fools
