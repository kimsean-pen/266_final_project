Welcome to the home of the brave
Where you become a true master by being a slave
Where you seek too many answers, but find another question
Stuck to a screen, you won't be the exception
Of not working, not hustling
Not failed, christian or a muslim
You pay the same way
And when you pay your taxes
To get the access
DNA matches
Flames and clashes
Waking up
Time is up
You don't fit in as well as what it's all about
Waking up
Time is up
Boom, Blast! Raise your fist!
Break free from the mist before you can't resist
In the end we are all going down
Down this made up life
Boom, blast! Raise your fist!
Break free from the mist before you can't resist
In the end we're all going down this made up life
Welcome to the home of the brave
Where love only makes you start dig your own grave
Where you don't seek heroes, you're looking for thieves
You accept the law, but'ya hate the police
Begging for a world in peace
Where religion is a mental disease
And you won't get down on your knees
'Cause no one shall question your believes
Waking up
Time is up
Boom, blast! Raise your fist!
Break free from the mist before you can't resist
In the end we are all going down
Down this made up life
Boom, blast! Raise your fist!
Break free from the mist before you can't resist
In the end we're all going down this made up life
