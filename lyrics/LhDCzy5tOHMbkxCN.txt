He would swear by his mouth almighty

I was living in a world of make believe
When my best friend wrote and told me
That there may be a job in the city
I was living in a world of make believe
When my best friend wrote and told me
That there may be a job in the city
And you never told me

He would dream about another scheme
About another sordid hall of dreams
About a man who's king of industry
He would swear by his mouth almighty
He would buy the best
But never something new
And he never told me

I like kicking in the gutter and
Wishing i was lucky
Wishing i was lucky, wishing i was lucky
Oh, i like kicking in the gutter
Wishing i was lucky, wishing i was lucky

It's the only life i know

Lie, lie, lie is all you ever do
To make me wanna push on through
Cry, cry, cry is all i ever do
Say you wanna make me push on through

I like kicking in the gutter and
Wishing i was lucky
Wishing i was lucky, wishing i was lucky
Oh, i like kicking in the gutter
Wishing i was lucky, i was wishing i was lucky
Kicking in the gutter
Wishing i was lucky, wishing i was lucky

It's the only life i know

My best friend wrote and told me so
He said, that there may be a job in the city, yeah, yeah yeah, oh baby
I like kicking in the gutter and wishing i was lucky
Wishing i was lucky, wishing i was lucky
I like kicking in the gutter, wishing i was lucky
I was wishing i was lucky,
Kicking in the gutter
Wishing i was lucky, wishing i was lucky

Hey son go, hey son go, to the city
Hey son go, hey son go, to the city
Hey son go, hey son go, to the city
Hey son go, hey son go, to the city
