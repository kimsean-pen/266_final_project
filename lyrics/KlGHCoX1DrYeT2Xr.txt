Told off so terribly loud
Cut off my hand as I reached for the fire
Sound sleep so terribly foul
Foresaw the end of an era

We're singing a song for the crickets
We're singing a song for the crickets
You look suspicious
I've no suspicion
Can't deal the dark cards
Can't tame the night hawks
Can't overcome our fall

Out late with all the undead
Kicking myself as we blow through the gates
Murmuring brook in my head
Sweet little nothings, verbatim

We're singing a song for the crickets
We're singing a song for the crickets
You look suspicious
I've no suspicion
Can't deal the dark cards
Can't tame the night hawks
Can't overcome our fall

Say it to yourself in a different voice
Say it to yourself in a different voice
Say it to yourself in a different voice than yours
Say it to yourself in a different voice
Say it to yourself in a different voice
Say it to yourself in a different voice than yours

We're singing a song for the crickets
We're singing a song for the crickets
You look suspicious
I've no suspicion
Can't deal the dark cards
Can't tame the night hawks
Can't overcome our fall

Is it the truth you don't approve?
Is it too good to you, to you, to you, to you?
Is it the truth you don't approve
It is too good to you, to you, to you, to you
