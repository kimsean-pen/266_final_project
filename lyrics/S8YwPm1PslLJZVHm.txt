Saw you in a music video
Admit my heart slipped down to my chest
I shed a tear just for how young you were
With your hair dyed black and your leather vest

And when the singer gripped the microphone
His lips were tight and his eyes were so sad
You held a flower underneath your nose
That dirty look you could've patented it

Now when the shore line shine through your night window
And the one that you love looks a mile away
You could plant a kiss on your reflection
And tell yourself it travel express from me
Travel express from me

In the seat in the back of a dime
I saw the side of your face through your hair
Your husband smiled and said he heard of me
I shook his hands and then I change instead
I guess the page is gonna turn some more
Will be all wrinkled in our baggy clothes
I searched the channels, put the oldies on
Remember this and you might be a ghost now

Now when the shore line shine through your night window
And the one that you love looks a mile away
You could plant a kiss on your reflection
And tell yourself it travel express from me
Travel express from me

The fast first express whispering wishes
Look out for yourself girl, you'll be alright
The stars fall around you
The planets surround you
Take care of yourself girl, you'll be just fine

Look out for yourself girl, you'll be alright

Travel express from me
Travel express from me
Travel express from me
Travel express from me
