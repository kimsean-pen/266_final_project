An expedition
Into desolation road where I'm a...

Castaway, going at it alone
Castaway, now I'm on my own
Castaway, going at it alone
Castaway, now I'm on my own
Lost and found, trouble bound
Castaway

I'm on a sentimental journey into sight and sound

Castaway, going at it alone
Castaway, now I'm on my own
Castaway, going at it alone
Castaway, now I'm on my own
Lost and found, trouble bound
