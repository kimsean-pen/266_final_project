a rare and blistering sun shines down
on grace cathedral park
there with you i fear the time
when air gets dark
you know i don't spend days like this
caught up in lost times of youth that i miss

can almost hear rollercoasters
see sailboats in the sea
hear noise and screaming
weaving in and out of
happy music box sounds

but here on the ground
we're so far away from that
time turned older now

we walked down the hill
i feel the coming on
of the fading sun
and i know for sure
that you'll never be the one
it's the forbidden moment that we live
that fires our sad escape
and holds passion more that words can say

tell me why are you like this
are you the same with anyone?
save me from my sickness and tell me
why do you treat me like?
tell me why are you like this
are you the same with anyone?
save me from my sickness and tell me
why are you like this?
