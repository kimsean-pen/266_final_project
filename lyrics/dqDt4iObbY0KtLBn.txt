You're now thirsty
Walking in the desert all alone
Hey!
You're now searching
Lost in isolation from your soul

From the bullets you bite
To the pain you request
You're finding them harder to digest
When the answers you seek
Are the ones you destroy
Your anger's well de ployed

Why can't you listen?
Why can't you hear?
Why can't you listen?
As love screams everywhere

Hey!
You now hunger
Feeding your mind with selfishness
Hey!
You now wander
Aimlessly around your consciousness

When your prophecies fail
When your thoughts become weak
Silence creates necessity
When you're clothing yourself
With the shields of despair
Your courage now impaired

Why can't you listen?
Why can't you hear?
Why can't you listen?
As love screams everywhere

You crucify all honesty
No signs you see do you believe
And all your words just twist and turn
Reviving just to crash and burn
Fighting till the bitter end
If only your heart could open
Up and listen

Why can't you listen?
Why can't you hear?
Why can't you listen?
As love screams everywhere

Why can't you listen?
Why can't you hear?
Why can't you listen?
As love screams everywhere
