Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay

At the starting line, a never ending race
What I've got inside isn't common place
I've been dreaming about hopeful better days
Time for dreaming's done, time to face the sun

Flying high above the world
It's a new life, it's a new mind
And I will never fall

The time is now
I can't contain myself, I've never felt so alive
The time is now
I'm past the breaking point, I set my soul on fire
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
The time is now
The time is now

I cannot stop, see another way
Am I looking for another cheap escape?
I've been pushing forward, crushing everything
It's a push and pull
It's a give and take

Flying high above
And it's a new life, it's a new mind
And I will never fall

The time is now
I can't contain myself, I've never felt so alive
The time is now
I'm past the breaking point, I set my soul on fire
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
The time is now
The time is now

Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!

The time is now
I can't contain myself, I've never felt so alive
The time is now
I'm past the breaking point, I set my soul on fire
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
The time is now
The time is now
