Roaring screams
Rush over the hills
Slicing the air, filling our ears.

Tainted hands
Carrying horns of steel.
They claim the road
In the name of fear.

Stay,
The night is filled with terror.
Stay here in my arms forever.
Stay,
Between these walls we'll start
A war of our own.

There's no drink
To allay their thirst.
Till the world burns
They won't rest their heads.

Stay,
The night is filled with terror.
Stay here in my arms forever.
Stay,
Between these walls we'll fight
A war of our own.
Stay, outside it's raining fire.
Stay were I can
Keep you safe and warm.

Stay, outside it's raining fire,
stay until the flames die down.
Stay, my love, and fight
This war of our own.
