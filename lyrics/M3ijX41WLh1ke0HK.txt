To the mountains

I Lost Touch With me
I was And Still Am Fire
Ignite! To the Mountains

Live Breath Sense Move
I know It pains me too
Ignite! To the Mountains

Lies, deceit
Fright, escape
Caught, burdened
Gone, trapped
Get up, on your feet
Give me, your very self
It's time to Rise!

Persist Progress
Chin up
And Ignite!
To the Mountains

Cast the light - deadly trail
I see it now
Sky is lit - opens up
I want my share
Lift me up - carry me
I need you now
Heal the wounds - bloody deep
I have to stop
Ignite! To the Mountains
