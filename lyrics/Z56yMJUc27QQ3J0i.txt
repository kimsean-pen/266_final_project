We could live in a house outside of town,
We could build our own version of society,
Well, got to pay
To pay
Time to pay
To pay
There'd be no one to answer to
And complicate our lives,
We could be
The epitome of self sufficience.
Time to pay! To pay!
Time to pay; you've got to pay me!
Why should I?
Why should we pay for your mistake?
To carry on.
Why should we carry on your false integrity?
When you've shown us that you
Can't even keep your nest clean.
So far we've put finacial gain
Ahead of human needs,
Quality of our lives should be prioritized.
Time to pay! To pay!
Time to pay; you've got to pay me!
Why should I?
Why should we pay for your mistake?
To carry on. To carry on
Modify your version so we can carry on.
To carry on.
To be conclusive,
I'd like to say,
You've done a super-fine job with your display.
I see now that you cannot comprehend
What it means to respect your life and then some!
To be rich, that would be great.
No, but it doesn't mean POO-POO without your nest!
So why should I pay for your misake, man?
Why should I?
Why, why should we pay for your mistake?
To carry on.
Why should I?
Why, why should we pay for your mistake?
To carry on.
Modify your version so we can carry on.
To carry on.
