Ohhh
Ahhh
When I need a small reminder
When my legs can't find the road
When I'm heavy with my burden
So my back its tired and bow
Got these questions I collected
He brings the answer to my ear

Because, my God has a telephone
Hear it ringin' in the morning
My God has a telephone
Hear Him callin' out a warning
It may be, long distance
But you know there ain't no fear
All it takes is just persistance
And he's on the line with me
You can reach him any hour
And his voice is loud and clear

Call him up
Feel the power
Make a deaf man, begin to hear
Winter, Spring or Fall, I hear his call
To put my faith over fear

My God has a telephone
Hear it ringin' in the morning
My God has a telephone
Hear Him callin' out a warning
My God has a telephone
Hear it ringin' in the morning
