I don't want to know your name
And I do want your private number, baby
All I know is that to me, you look like you're lots of fun
Open up your loving arms, I want some, want some

I set my sights on you
(And no one else will do)
And I've got to have my way now, baby

All I know is that to me, you look like you're lots of fun
Open up your loving arms, watch out, here I come

You spin me right round baby, right round
Like a record, baby, right round, round, round
You spin me right round baby, right round
Like a record, baby, right round, round, round

I don't want to be your friend now, baby
But I want to move it just a little bit closer

All I know is that to me, you look like you're lots of fun
Open up your loving arms, watch out, here I come

You spin me right round baby, right round
Like a record, baby, right round, round, round
You spin me right round baby, right round
Like a record, baby, right round, round, round

All I know is that to me, you look like you're lots of fun
Open up your loving arms, watch out, here I come

You spin me right round baby, right round
Like a record, baby, right round, round, round
You spin me right round baby, right round
Like a record, baby, right round, round, round
