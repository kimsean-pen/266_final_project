Hey stranger, how you been
Feels like I'm standing on the outside looking in
At the mess we left behind
And it's a long way to fall
I gave you everything I had
I gave it all
And then my heart was on the line

I can't hate you
Any longer
I know I'm going to miss you
I'll forget it and let it go.

Say hello to goodbye, cause it's gone forever
No more try, you and I
Not now, not ever
And I'll get by without you
I'm not going back again
I'm not going to lie to you
Cause, that was there and only then.

Say hello to goodbye
Say hello...

And this is how it has to be
Cause it's a deadly combination, you and me
You know it's undeniable
Even though we tried it all
We brought the worst out in each other
I recall
We can't act it anymore

What doesn't kill you
It makes you stronger
And though I'm going to miss you
I'll forget it and let you go

Say hello to good-bye
It's gone forever
No more try, you and I
Not now, not ever
And I'll get by without you
I'm not going back again
I'm not going to lie to you
Cause, that was there and only then.

Say hello to goodbye
Say hello...

And even though the tears will dry
I can't completely disconnect
Couldn't make the compromise
Didn't have a safety net

Say hello to goodbye
Heeey ya ya

Say hello, goodbye

Say hello to good-bye
It's gone forever
No more try, you and I
Not now, not ever
And I'll survive without you
I'm not going back again
I'm not going to lie to you
Cause, that was there and only then.
Say hello, to goodbye
Say hello, to goodbye
Say hello, hello
To goodbye.
