I was ridin', I was ridin', oh
The sun, the sun, the sun was rising from the field

I got a feeling I just can't shake
I got a feeling that just won't go away
You've got it, just keep on pushing and, keep on pushing and
Push the sky away

And if your friends think that you should do it different
And if they think that you should do it the same
You've got it, just keep on pushing and, keep on pushing and
Push the sky away

And if you feel you got everything you came for
If you got everything and you don't want no more
You've got it, just keep on pushing and, keep on pushing and
Push the sky away

And some people say it's just rock 'n' roll
Aw, but it gets you right down to your soul
You've got it, just keep on pushing and, keep on pushing and
Push the sky away

You've got it, just keep on pushing and, keep on pushing and
Push the sky away

You've got it, just keep on pushing and, keep on pushing and
Push the sky away
