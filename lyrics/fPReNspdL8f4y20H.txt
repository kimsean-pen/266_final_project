I feel so far from my home
Till the lights start fading
Streets come alive in the night when we're alone

Your thoughts are naked tonight
In this neon glow
Lit up like a firefly our circuits are aligned and ready to go

Open yourself to me we better entwine
Breathing in binary our systems inline
Searching for frequencies and scanning through time
Both lost in the datastream that's leaking our minds

Now I don't feel so alone
When the lights start fading
We bathe in the shadow of the city far above

Come hide away with me tonight
In this neon home
Glowing like a firefly the datastream online and ready to flow

Open yourself to me we better entwine
Breathing in binary our systems inline
Searching for frequencies and scanning through time
Both lost in the datastream that's leaking our minds

Open yourself to me we better entwine
Breathing in binary our systems inline
Searching for frequencies and scanning through time
Both lost in the datastream

Open yourself to me we better entwine
Breathing in binary our systems inline
Searching for frequencies and scanning through time
Both lost in the datastream that's leaking our minds
