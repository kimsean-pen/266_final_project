she doesn't panic from the warning signs
she's hiding under foreign cotton and sheets of ice
until i come around and clear her mind
but i know who you are, so why don't we start again
it was colder by the pond
so she wore a pair of my gloves
then she flew me to milan
she calls me her american love
a bay-and-gable in a small lake town
she wants to buy it from her dad just to tear it down
then tell her uncles they can have it now
but we're still coming by just for the fireworks
it was colder by the pond
so she wore a pair of my gloves
then she flew me to milan
she calls me her american love
if i belonged to anyone
i'd choose a blond and have a son
and dress him up in tennis shoes
and play along until he's good
if i belonged to anyone
i'd choose a blond and have a son
and teach him things to get him by
the city girls will never bite
if i belonged to anyone
i'd choose a blond and have a son
and dress him up in tennis shoes
and play along until he's good yeah
it's the american love
