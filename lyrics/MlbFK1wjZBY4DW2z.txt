Ah baby don't you know you sound like
Lately you've been on my mind
You know when nothing feels right
You don't even want to see the signs

You know I know
You know I know it's not about you
You know I know
It's true, it's true
You know I know it's not about you

Watch them turn us inside out
Let us burn just pulsating it out now
Now baby don't you know you sound like
Oh maybe I'm just losing my mind
It's hard to keep all this anger inside
We're done talking, because I'm so tired of all your lies

You know I know
You know I know it's not about you
You know I know
It's true, it's true
You know I know it's not about you

Watch them turn us inside out
Let us burn just pulsating it out now
Watch them turn us inside out
Let us burn just pulsating it out now

You know I know
You know I know it's not about you
You know I know
It's true, it's true
You know I know it's not about you
You know I know
You know I know it's not about you
You know I know
(It's true, it's true)
You know I know it's not about you
