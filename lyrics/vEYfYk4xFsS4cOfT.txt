Can you hear the marching
Beating of the drums
Once again the dogs are out for blood

Words and accusations
History revised
The time has come to tell
That you're alright
Oh how you tried
I know that you tried
To save us

Save us

I remember dreaming
Not so long ago
The change was gonna come
I still had hope
How long must I keep waiting?
Feeling so ignored
Is anything worth saving anymore?
I just don't know
But need you so

Don't let us fall again
We can't fight this on our own
Who'll save us in the end?
Have we lost our last hero

Tyrants overtaking
Intoxicate with lies
There is no escaping
Not this time
The simple men receiving
Defending every crime
Somehow still believing they are right
So hypnotized

Don't let us fall again
We can't fight this on our own
Who'll save us in the end?
Have we lost our last hero

Tell me where are the heroes
No
Tell me where are the heroes
No, no
Have we lost all our heroes
No

How could this be
We couldn't see
Now we are left here to fight this on our own

Build them up to tear them down
What we've done
I'm far from proud
Chew 'em up
Spit 'em up
In the end
Who'll save us now?

Can you hear the marching
Beating of the drums
Once again the dogs are out for blood

Words and accusations
History revised
The time has come to tell
That you're alright

Don't let us fall again
We can't fight this on our own
Who'll save us in the end?
Have we lost our last hero

Have we reached the end?
Are we last to know?
Are we still afraid?
Nowhere left to go
No, it's much too late
There's no hope to see
There is still a chance left
For you and me
