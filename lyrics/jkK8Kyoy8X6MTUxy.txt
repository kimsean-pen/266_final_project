Sweep the streets like a hurricane*
Nothing to lose
You've got yourself to blame
You're a six shooter
Hot like a pistol
A most creative self destructor
My lady, my queen
My only dream, a sight surpreme
I need you, oh I need you
I gave you my everything
High roller
When I look I see a stranger in you eyes
High roller
I wish it was the other way around
No stream of sorrow or deception
Flows to drench your preen and pride
Your strength through blackness and your frozen fire leaves no cracks to hide
Feeding on the life that lives to love you
Can't let this love remain
But I know it's my future that I'm trying to abstain
High roller
When I look I see a stranger in you eyes
High roller
A ramblin' rose, a treat for those who strive
High roller
A high flying bird, I can not shoot you down
High roller
I wish it was the other way around
Reckless and restless
I'm trying to hold you
You're pushing me over
I can not quit you
No, no, no, no, no!
You gave me a flash of what life's supposed to be
But you're rollin' high girl
Way too high for me
