Sweet heart, would you wake up today?
I promise, you would recognize my faith

I wanna show you, how I've grown in this place
In this place, I'm not alone and I know I'll be okay

But it's always harder, when the winter comes to stay
When I can't help but remember, all the words I'd never say

And it's killing me, that you're not here with me
I'm living happily, but I'm feeling guilty

Oh you won't believe, the wonders I can see
This world is changing me, but I'll love you faithfully

Everything is taller these days
Or maybe I feel smaller and time rushes away

There's so much I could show you
Oh, the great grandchildren have been laughing like we did when we were young
Oh, I've been laughing like we did when we were young

But it's killing me, that you're not here with me
I'm living happily, but I'm feeling guilty
Oh you won't believe, the wonders I can see
This world is changing me, but I I'll love you faithfully

Oh, it's killing me, that you're not here with me
I'm living happily, but I'm feeling guilty

Oh you won't believe, the wonders I can see
This world is changing me, but I I'll love you faithfully

Yeah, it's killing me, that you're not here with me
I'm living happily, but I'm feeling guilty

Oh you won't believe, the wonders I can see
This world is changing me, but I'll love you faithfully
