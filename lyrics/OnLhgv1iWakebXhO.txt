When the ghastly mourners awakens from sleep,
and the volant funeral crows are watching,
like evil omens in shadowed murmur,
they welcome me again.

Agonized and flattered to once become
a part of this horror scenario,
I descend with arms open wide.

Armoured and filled with painful pleasure,
reflectingg streams of monstrous mirages,
I will not hide.

Loosing control in seductive madness,
spiritual revelations, apocalyptic hypnosis.
Dead colours appear within unshallow graves;
alone in awe I face abhorrence below.

Trapped inside to suffer in silence,
torn apart in mind and sense,
baptized in this nightly glamour-
Rites of splendid essence.

Agonized and flattered, I once became
a part of the horror scenario.
Armoured and filled with painful pleasure,
I did not hide

Now when the gates are no longer shut,
I withdraw from the light of the sun.
