Pack my bags and leave today
You read this I'll be far away
Ain't gonna give ya no moon in June
Never see you it'll be too soon

One-eyed Jack
Gotta watch my back
Beat you around
Guess I better shut you down

Shut you down
Shut you down
Steal your thunder, turn you round

Listen up 'cos I'm telling you
The magic moments were way too few
I'd like to stay, but you got too weird
You don't look right since you grew that beard

One-eyed Jack
Gotta watch my back
See you around
Guess I better shut you down

Shut you down
Shut you down
Steal your thunder, turn you round

So... go!

Tell you, babe, what I'm gonna do
Leave this town and I'll leave you too
I Don't wanna see your face no more
Don't come 'round knocking at my door

One-eyed Jack
Gotta watch my back
You're also around
Guess I better shut you down

Shut you down
Shut you down
Steal your thunder and turn you round
