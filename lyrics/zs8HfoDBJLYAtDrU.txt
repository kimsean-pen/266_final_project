Call it magic
Call it true
I call it magic
When I'm with you

And I just got broken
Broken into two
Still I call it magic
When I'm next to you

And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
No, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

No, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
No, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

Call it magic
Cut me into two
And with all your magic
I disappear from view

And I can't get over
Can't get over you
Still I call it magic
Such a precious jewel

And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
No, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

No, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
No, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

Wanna fall
I fall so far
I wanna fall
Fall so hard
And I call it magic
And I call it true
Call it magic

And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
Still believe in magic
Well, yes, I do

Oh, yes, I do
Oh, yes, I do
Oh, yes, I do
Of course, I do
