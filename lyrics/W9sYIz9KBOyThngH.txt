I was head over feet
for a fact commited
you said I would cheat
and I cracked and I did it

I didn't look
so I mistook
the fact, *your* acts
were goodhearted

Is this feeling
an obsession of an evilness
It's revealing
it's sweating through
my evening dress

I'm in a moonlight of madness
wrapped up in sadness
I don't understand it myself
God, I wish I was somebody else
I cant deny

You'll have me fooled
the? thought you wanted me to
You'll have me fooled
the? thought you wanted me to

I lost the game that I started
I'm to blamed that we parted
can no longer deny
i leave love to die

I didn't look
so I mistook
the fact, your acts
were goodhearted

Is this feeling
an obsession of an evilness
It's revealing
it's sweating through
my evening dress

I'm in a moonlight of madness
wrapped up in sadness
I don't understand it myself
God, I wish I was somebody else
I cant deny
