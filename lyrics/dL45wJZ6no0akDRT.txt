Something in the wind - tastes so sweet
Time to eat again - a peach bite melody
Mama made it rain - milk and blood
So the funk is on ten - never mind enough

I glow for you
I'm in the silo
I glow for you
I'm in the silo

Oh my god - Prophecy upon the bones
We gets up like trampolines - Bombo Fabrika on a roll
Get down gently - Gently down the stream as I row
Eyes blink open and I see all my little thoughts in a row

Nicest when I dream - I go go go
Purple clouds in teams - float past (drift by) my window
cup em in my palms - my play dough
make a cherry bomb- set them back afloat

I glow for you
I'm in the silo
I glow for you
I'm in the silo

Oh my god - Prophecy upon the bones
We gets up like trampolines - Bombo Fabrika on a roll
Get down gently - Gently down the stream as I row
Eyes blink open and I see all my little thoughts in a row
