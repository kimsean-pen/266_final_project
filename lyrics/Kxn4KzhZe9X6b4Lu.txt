I put on my clothes like a body guard
I put the dogs on patrol in my own back yard
I don't want to fight, but I'm constantly ready
And I don't rock the boat, but its always unsteady

There's an elephant in my head
And I tiptoe around it
There are egg shells on the floor
Therefor I never touch the ground

It's like that old black hole
No matter how you try
You set out each day
Never to arrive

I got my eye on the prize, but it looks just like the mystery
And it all goes by on the lonesome trail to victory
I'm drawing the blinds; I've got my own four walls
Man the show really starts once the curtain falls

Take this thorn from my side
Fix this chip on my shoulder
Time is racing with the clock
And I ain't getting any older

It's like that old black hole
No matter how you try
You set out each day
Never to arrive

I put on my finest thread
And I wrap up my body tight
With the sun in my eyes
I step into the night
Like a mystery in the dark
Oh its just another kind of light

I don't expect you do believe me, but everything is alright
I don't make rules for a living
I don't do tricks for a dime
I was born on a good day - deaf, dumb, and blind
Who am I to tell the truth
Oh, I don't even know what it is

Well I don't know how to say it
But I know that I can show you
I said I don't know how to say it
But I know that I can show you

I tied my boots up tight and I head straight to bed
There's a pistol and a crystal underneath my pillow
There's a tender heart inside that ugly armadillo
These are tears of joy cried the weeping willow
There's a spirit in the air, there ain't to way around it
I was not prepared to lose it all the moment that I found it

It's like that old black hole
No matter how you try
You set out each day
Never to arrive
