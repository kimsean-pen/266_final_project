Oh, well lesson dance
And shoot to God
A storm-suffered owl
You're not invisible inside your car

No matter what stupid sort of mission you're on
Well, you're not invisible inside your car
I go absolutely mental
Good ramblin' George

Well, you're not invisible inside your car
No matter, you could breathe it like your flies in a jar
Yeah, you're not invisible
I like the saline tea

Well, it's true that the moon could pull it back and far away from me
I should just let it be
Well, it's true that the moon could pull it back and far away from me
(And it's sad)

Oh, we had to have some time
Gonna shake like a charm
Well, you weren't invisible
Not all along

No matter how many eons came and are gone
We were not invisible
I knew that

I like the saline tea
Well, it's true that the moon could pull it back and far away from me
And there's the orphan sea
We were never invisible, but that I guess we did not see

Of course this all had been laid down
Way before we lay down for it all
Before we had a course, of course
Of course this all had been laid down
Of course we lay down
Of course we lay down
Of course we lay down
Of course we lay down
Of course we lay down
Of course we lay down
I like the saline tea
Well, it's true that the moon could pull it back and far away from me
I like the orphan sea
Well, we were never invisible, but that I guess we could not see
We'll get crushed by the ocean
But it will not get us wet
Crushed by the ocean
But it will not get us wet
Crushed by the ocean
But it will not get us wet
Crushed by the ocean
But it will not get us wet
