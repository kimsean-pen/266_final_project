I've been so sad and lonely
Ever since you went away
You were my one and only
Now I'm only one and I must say

I liked it better when you were around
Now that you're gone the grass is all brown
And the skies are grey
I don't know what to say
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me

You know I'm lost without you
Cause I was lost when I was with you, too
But now I'm losing it through and through
Seeing as how I was lost on you

I can't excuse all the things that I've done
You hate my guts? You ain't the only one
Thought I was bad before?
Now I'm an open sore
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me

I liked it better when you were around
Now that you're gone the grass is all brown
And the skies are grey
I don't know what to say
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me
