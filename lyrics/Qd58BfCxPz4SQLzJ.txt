Tune in, potted plant
Watch it grow
High definition
Attrition is on
Sitcom
Same time every day
Just for you
That's the news
Once a man, now a boy in blue
This whole world's got it out for you
Once a man, now a boy in blue
This whole world's got it out for you
History, how'd you get so mean?
Who'd you beat?
Play for keeps
Right as can be
Make the team
FOP, ICE, POS supremacy
Once a man, now a boy in blue
This whole world's got it out for you
Once a man, now a boy in blue
This whole world's got it out for you
Wake up, sugar, coffee, and cream
Out of sight, taking aim
All look the same
Misery
Half asleep
Heaven reality creep
Keep the peace
Once a man, now a boy in blue
This whole world's got it out for you
Once a man, now a boy in blue
This whole world's got it out for you
