Yeah, the house is a rockin', don't bother knockin'

Yeah, the house is a rockin', don't bother come on in
Walkin' up the street you can hear the sound
Of some bad honky tonkers really layin' it down
They've seen it all for years and 'ave got nothin' to lose
So get out on the floor shimmy 'til you shake sumpin' loose
Well, the house is a rockin', don't bother knockin'
