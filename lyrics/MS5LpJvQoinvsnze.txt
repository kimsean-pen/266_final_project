April 26th, 1992
There was a riot on the streets
Tell me where were you?
You were sittin' home watchin' your TV
While I was participating in some anarchy

First spot we hit it was my liquor store
I finally got all that alcohol I can't afford
With red lights flashin', time to retire
And then we turned that liquor store into a structure fire

Next stop we hit it was the music shop
It only took one brick to make that window drop
Finally we got our own P.A.
Where do you think I got this guitar that you're hearing today? hey

(Call fire at? mobile station at Alamidos and Anaheim. Its, ah, flamin' up good.)
(10-4, Alamedas and Anaheim)
Homicide, never doin' no time

When we returned to the pad to unload everything
It dawned on me that I need new home furnishings
So once again we filled the van until it was full
Since that day my livin' room's been much more comfortable
'Cause everybody in the hood has had it up to here
It's getting harder and harder and harder each and every year
Some kids went in a store with their mother
I saw her when she came out she was gettin' some Pampers
They said it was for the black man
They said it was for the Mexican
And not for the white man
But if you look at the streets
It wasn't about Rodney King
Not this fucked up situation and these fucked up police
It's about coming up
And staying on top
And screamin' 187 on a motherfuckin' cop
It's not in the paper it's on the wall
National guard
Smoke from all around

(Units - units be advised of an attempt 211 to arrest now at 938 Temple, 9-3-8 Temple. Thirty subjects with bats trying to get inside the CP's
house. I think they're... they're trying to kill him.)
As long as I'm alive, I'm a live illegal

Let it burn
Wanna let it burn
Wanna let it burn
Wanna, wanna let it burn
(I feel insanity)
