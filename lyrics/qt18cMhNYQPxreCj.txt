Hello, Hello

Three cellphones and I still don't ever call 'em
Why would I call 'em? Bitch you know I'm ballin'
Spendin' money, make it bounce back like Spalding
Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans
And he ain't talkin' money nigga, why the fuck you talkin'
All my bitches bossy, all my diamonds flossy
Rap game sriracha man you know I'm saucy
I got a white dude in Boston, he whip an Audi

Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk

Three cellphones and I still don't ever text 'em
Catch me out in public, and you know I'm flexing

\n He saying that he got connections, Imma finesse him
I got a nigga out in Texas he swang the Lexus
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch niggas get the most not the lesser
Why would I even stress 'em when they be pressin'
I just leave 'em guessing and move on to the next one

Ok this the part where I need ya'll to make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans
