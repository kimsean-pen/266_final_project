Oooooh
You just know, when you know
you just know.

Oooooh
You got somewhere to go
when you go

Let's be like nothing else
Let's be like nothing else

Taste like nothing else
Help like nothing else
Ease you in confidence
Seems something like happiness

Oooooh
You just know, when you know
you just know.

Oooooh
You got somewhere to go
when you go.

When you love them,
go and tell them
Tell them over and over and over again
Heaven forbid opportunities missed.

If it's over
Let it be over
Because when time and again
you have tried it again
And you've worn it right down to the bone.

You just know, when you know
you just know.

You got somewhere to go
when you go.

Let's be like nothing else
Let's be like nothing else
Taste like nothing else
Help like nothing else
Ease you in confidence
Seems something like happiness

Let's be like nothing else
Let's be like nothing else
Taste like nothing else
Help like nothing else
Ease you in confidence
Seems something like happiness
