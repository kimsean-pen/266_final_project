High rise blocks out the blue
The pavement sticks like glue
You're getting nowhere
Hitch a ride on a wing and a prayer

You're crying out loud
A face lost in the crowd
A voice no-one can hear
You'll get by on a wing and a prayer

So let it be
Let the breeze carry you to the sea
Let the wind take you where it will go.

Rain, thunder, blowing down
(You better believe it, love is everywhere)
(And if you can feel it, you're halfway there)
Feels like you're gonna drown
(It's just another love song, ain't no big thing)
Reach out, no one's there
(Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing)
Just hold on to a wing and a prayer.

(It's just a little homegrown philosophy)
Like smoke in the air
(Take it or leave it, it comes for free)
You'll slowly slip away
(It's just another love song, ain't no big thing)
All senses prevail
(Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing)
You'll fly home on a wing and a prayer

So let it be
Let the breeze carry you to the sea
Let the wind take you where it will go

Now you walk that high wire
(You better believe it, love is everywhere)

(And if you can feel it, you're halfway there)
In truth you'll want to fly
(It's just another love song, ain't no big thing)
You'll fly everywhere
(Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing)
If you trust to a wing and a prayer
So let it be
Let the breeze carry you to the sea
Let the wind take you where it will go
It's just another love song, ain't no big thing
Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing
It's just a little homegrown philosophy
Take it or leave it, it comes for free
If you trust to a wing and a prayer
You better believe it, love is everywhere
And if you can feel it, you're halfway there
It's just another love song, ain't no big thing
Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing
If you trust to a wing and a prayer
Just a little homegrown philosophy
Take it or leave it, it comes for free
It's just another love song, ain't no big thing
