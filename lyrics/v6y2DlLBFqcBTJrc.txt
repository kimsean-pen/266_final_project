All the people I love are here
All the people that I love can't hear
All the people I love are drunk
All the people that I love are here
All the people I love are here
All the people that I love come here
All the people I love are drunk
All the people that I think I am are drunk

All you have left is one Kraft dinner that I brought back for you last summer
All you have left is one reminder of the time we spent when I was blind
All you can taste is that one Kraft dinner that I prepared when your chances were slimmer
All you can hear is my refusal 'cause I haven't got the time for a jerk-off loser
All you can hear is my refusal 'cause I haven't got the time for a jack-your-body loser
All you can hear is my refusal 'cause I haven't got the time for a jerk-off loser
All you can hear is my refusal 'cause I haven't got the time for a jerk-off loser

No more space or time
For last supper baby, baby
Even if you prepare nice
And for... I have not got the time
