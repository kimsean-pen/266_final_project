Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

I know what's on your mind
Let's lay it on the line
All the things were missin', ooh

Look, I just came back to town
Drink that green dragon down
It's time for me talk and you to listen

I know my heart, I know it well
I bet your analyst forgot to ask that question
We're at the start and time will tell

Till the end
Your name will touch my lips like prayin'
Till the end
I'll be the keeper of the words your heart is sayin'

Till the end
You and I will learn a language new and unspoken
Till the end
We'll be the ones who hold the key to a lock that's open

Oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah

Girl, not so long ago
A boy that didn't know
That he was hurtin', ooh

Pushed somebody down
They fell and hit the ground
But I never meant for you to be that person

You know my heart, you know me well
It's never been my style to take advantage
We're at the start and time will tell

Till the end
Your name will touch my lips like prayin'
Till the end
I'll be the keeper of the words your heart is sayin'

Till the end (yeah)
You and I will learn a language new and unspoken
Till the end (till the end)
We'll be the ones who share the key to a lock that's open

Yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa

Till the end
Your name will touch my lips like prayin'
Till the end
I'll be the keeper of the words your heart is sayin'

Till the end
You and I will learn a language new and unspoken
Till the end (till the end)
We'll be the ones who share a key to a lock that's open

Till the end
Your name will touch my lips like prayin', yeah
Till the end
I'll be the keeper of the words your heart is sayin'

Till the end (yeah)
When you and I will learn a language new and unspoken
Till the end (till the end)
We'll be the ones who share a key to a lock that's open

It's open, it's all the way open
(It's all the way open, yeah)
