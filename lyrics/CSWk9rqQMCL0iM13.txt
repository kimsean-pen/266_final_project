Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was
You holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

And now we're flying through the sky
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waiting for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
Filled my heart with your bliss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flying through the sky
I hope this night will last forever
Oh oh oh oh

CHORUS:
Ain't nobody
(body baby)
Loves me better
(loves me better)
Makes me happy
(so happy)
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody (nobody)
Loves me better than you (ah ah ah ah yeah yeah)

I wait for night time to come
And bring you to me
Can't believe I'm the one
I was so lonely
I feel like no one could feel
I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real
I need this feeling!

I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever woah woah woah woah woah

CHORUS

And first you put your arms around me
(repeated)
Then you put your charms around me
(repeated)
I can't resist this sweet surrender
(repeated)
Oh my nights are warm and tender
(repeated)
We stare into each other's eyes
(repeated)
And what we see is no surprise
(repeated)
Got a feeling most with treasure
(repeated)
And a love so deep we cannot measure

CHORUS (x2)
