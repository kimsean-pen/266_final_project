Standing in a line
Wonder why it don't move
Tryna get a hand
Watching people break the rules
Maybe the man in charge, doesn't like my face
But then this world's not always good

And nothing's real but love
Nothing's real but love
No money, no house, no car, can beat love

They watch us open mouthed
As we joke around like fools
See who can be the worst
Watch what I can do
But then the door gets slammed
slammed right in my face
And I guess this world not always good

And nothing's real but love
Nothing's real but love
No house, no car, no job, can beat love

It won't fill you up

No money, no house, no car, is like love
(love, love, love, love
love, love, love, love)

I put it all away
Holding it back for a rainy day
But what if that day don't come
I need love

No money, no house, no car, is like love

It don't fill you up
It won't build you up
It won't fill you up
It's not love!
And nothing's real but love
No money, no house, no car, is like love
Nothing's real but love
No money, no house, no car, is like love
