I know I heard you right
I've been lyin' awake at night
Thinkin' about the words you said to me
I know it's hard for you
Sometimes you gotta let the feelin' through
I wanna know exactly how you feel, ooh yeah

I've tried to be patient
And give you a little more time
Now I need
To be sure
What's on your mind

Say it again, say yeah
Say the words I heard you whisper
Say it again, say yeah
When last night we were together
Lyin' next to me
You said to me
Say it, say it again

I knew right from the start
You were livin' with a broken heart
But baby I knew it'd take some time to heal
But now I must confess
The way you're fillin' me with happiness
Think that could be startin' something real, woo yeah

Repeat pre-chorus

Repeat chorus

And I just need to be sure
That you're mine forever
All I'm asking you for
Is to tell me whether
If I should be trustin' in you
Tell me if the words you whispered were true
Say it, say it, say it, say it

Repeat chorus (x2)
