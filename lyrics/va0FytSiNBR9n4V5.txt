Sing from the heart
Let them hear what our love is made of

My heart's afflicted; everywhere I turn, it reminds me of you
How we could write our headlines and make the world spin just for us
But we are not in motion, everything I feel is tied to our past
And even though I do regret saying all those hurtful things to you
I can't ignore the fact
That we've drifted off where there's no turning back
I lay my head down low
Keep hiding my heart away forever this way
The passion that we had inside I will never regret
I learned to live, to forgive and forget
The fire inside my heart will never be dimmed
But it won't burn for you and me

My heart will not be compromised
I won't drag my feet to a deadbeat
My heart will not be compromised
I won't drag my feet to a deadbeat

Let me hold your hand one last time
Let me lead you on your way back home to the age of your innocence
I'll let you hold my heart one last time
As you slowly turn away from here towards a life without me

Sing from the heart
Let them hear what our love is made of

I lay my head down low
Keep hiding my heart away forever this way
There is an ocean between us now
But we can't swim with our heavy hearts
I hear your words from the distance
"I don't love you, not anymore"

My heart will not be compromised
I won't drag my feet to a deadbeat
My heart will not be compromised
I won't drag my feet to a deadbeat

Let me hold your hand one last time
Let me lead you on your way back home to the age of your innocence
I'll let you hold my heart one last time
As you slowly turn away from here towards a life without me

There's an ocean between us
We can't swim with our heavy hearts
I will carry the burden to the bottom of our regrets
So take a final breath and let your lungs be filled with the death of our love
