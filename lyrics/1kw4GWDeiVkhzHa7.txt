I can read, I can write
I can breed, proven flight
Nurse my greed, crease enfold
Is it me, or my ego?
Write some words, make them rhyme
Thesis or tell me lie
Set the mood, something new
Is it me, or my attitude?

If you want to put off an image
The extremes, the extremes
Act it out, practicing, perfecting
Pressuring onto me, onto me, onto me, oh

I will wait in a phylum
To explain your asylum
I am tired analyzing
We've compared all our sightings, you must

I speak to hear my voice

I can read, I can write
I can breed, proven flight
Nurse my greed, crease enfold
Is it me, or my ego?
Write some words, make them rhyme
Thesis or story line
Set the mood, something new
Is it me, or my attitude?

If you want to put off an image
The extremes, the extremes
Act it out, practicing, perfecting
Pressuring onto me, onto me, onto me
Onto me, onto me, onto me, onto me, oh
