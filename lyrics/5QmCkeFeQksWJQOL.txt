From when I wake the want is
Under my eyes and I draw with my tongue
All of your lines in my mouth, in my mind, in its back and spine
The hold of me over your bones have of mine

The way that your mouth covers my mouth
The way that you suck all the darkness out
The way that my mouth covers your mouth
The way that I swallow the darkness down

From when I wake the want is
Under my tongue and I draw with my eyes
The all of your lines in my mouth, in my mind, in its back and spine
The hold of me over your bones have of mine

The way that your mouth covers my mouth
The way that you suck all the darkness out
The way that my mouth covers your mouth
The way that I swallow the darkness down

And all the doubt we had, it died out
And all the doubt we had, it died out
And all the doubt we had, it died out
And all the doubt we had, it died out
And all the doubt we had, it died out
And all the doubt we had, it died out
And all the doubt we had, it died out
And all the doubt we had, it died out
How do I let go of all this fucking love?
How do I let go of all this fucking love?

And all the doubt
And all the doubt
And all the doubt
And all the doubt
