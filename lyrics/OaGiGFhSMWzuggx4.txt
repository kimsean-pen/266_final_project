Well, there is nothing else that we can lose
I put heart upon my sleeve tonight
And I know everything will change it soon
'Cause I can see it in your eyes stuck

You won't be here for very long
If no one hears you, will you still want to sing?
And if the harmonies disappear
They can't take our place

Yes, I believe, I believe, I believe
That she is different than you and I
That she can see things that we can't see
She's alone in this modern life

And my voices forever change
But the notes are still same
And how long till you want to see?
I think we want it out of reach

And if it's something that would never come back
Well, I told you not to look at me
'Cause it's a man made thought with a God-like look
And we know we'll never have to go down

So praises to the war machine
And the distance is growing thin
And the hopelessness of a tiny earth
And a make shift hit rack

'Cause I watched as she walked away
I knew the moment she turned her back
Yes, she could never be the same again
And she is never coming back

I know the moment as she walked away
I know the moment as she walked away
I know the moment as she walked away
I saw the moment as she walked away

In the land of a thousand fathers
She was born on the Fourth of July
Well, that don't mean she was made in America
She was gone in the blink of an eye

She belongs but she acts like a stranger
She collapsed but she ain't free
I am my only devil
'Cause they'll believe what they want to believe
