Aye, aye

Aye, Shut The Fuck Up
Aye, Shut The Fuck Up

Don't let those numbers keep distorting your reality
You ain't shit, you a bitch if you askin' me
You can mind your fuckin' business I don't want no beef
But there ain't no fuckin peace for me until I rest in peace
Aye, I turn a massacre into a bloody masterpiece
OmenXIII leave the scene such a catastrophe
If they still ain't really fuckin' with me then they fast asleep
When I just can't sleep
I smoke some weed and get to counting sheep
Money jump, jumpin like a motherfuckin' athlete
Aye, Bitch I know, Bitch we know that you ain't trappin g
What the fuck you mean I thought that you was rollin 30 deep
Thought you had them 30 clip-extendos with the laser piece
Now you out here slippin', trippin', fallin' on the concrete
Mad because you broke, just keep hopin' you might make it g
But you best believe that you should never try to take the king
XIII, King of Demons, Prince of Shadows from deep underneath
Aye, Shut The Fuck Up, Bitch, shut the fuck up
Aye, Shut The Fuck Up, Bitch, shut the fuck up
Aye, Shut The Fuck Up, Bitch, shut the fuck up
Aye, Shut The Fuck Up, Bitch, shut the fuck up
Aye, what
