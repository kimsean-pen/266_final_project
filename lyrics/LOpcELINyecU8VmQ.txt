You're pushing me out
You're pushing me when all I do is not enough
All I do is not enough for you
You've pushed me down
You've pushed me down
Well I'll try and I'll try again
I'll try and I'll try again for you

This distance won't keep your words from screaming my name
This distance won't keep your words from smothering me
If I could keep you out
If I could keep you...

You're pushing me out
You're pushing me when all I do is not enough
All I do is not enough for you
You've pushed me down
You've pushed me down
Well I'll try and I'll try again
I'll try and I'll try again for you

Your throat is worn away
You're still screaming my name
You scream relentlessly
If I could keep you out
If I could keep you...

You're pushing me out
You're pushing me when all I do is not enough
All I do is not enough for you
You've pushed me down
You've pushed me down
Well I'll try and I'll try again
I'll try and I'll try again for you

You pushed me then pulled me back to where we started (where we started)
You pushed me then pulled me back to where we started (where we started)
You pushed me then pulled me back
Back to where we started
Back to where we started
Lost, confused from this abuse
Back to where we...

You're pushing me out
You're pushing me when all I do is not enough
All I do is not enough for you
You've pushed me down
You've pushed me down
Well I'll try and I'll try again
I'll try and I'll try again for you

You've pushed me out
You've pushed me out (I'll try and I'll try again
I'll try and I'll try again for you)
You've pushed me out
You've pushed me out (I'll try and I'll try again
I'll try and I'll try again for you)

You pushed me then you pulled me back to where we started
(where we started)
Well I'll try and I'll try again
I'll try and I'll try again for you
You pushed me then you pulled me back to where we started
(where we started)
Well I'll try and I'll try again
I'll try and I'll try again for you
