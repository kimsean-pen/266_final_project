Said the skeptic
Born and bred negative
No peace for the calm collective
There's a cold war coming in
Go

Please let me know when it's gone
It's really not the best of times
And all we've got is guided by this light within
I'll hold us both until the smoke clears
We're suffocating

Sick of our society
Sick of trying to fit inside a life I cannot lead
Sick of always following
Sick of trying to be another cog in their machine
Sick of running on empty, pushing the blame
Waiting for tomorrow to save us from today
There's no profit in poverty
And I'm running on empty
I'm running on empty
Running myself into the ground

Said the sceptic
Born and bred negative
No peace for the calm collective
There's a cold war coming in
Go

I feel the need
It's a darkness disease
In this dead town, lights out
The creatures come out in the streets
My ears are burning
In this circle of eyes
Close the curtain and hide the knife
We're stacking up
We're piling high
We've gone too far to recognise salvation
This is civil isolation

The bitter truth of the world is fucking sickening

Tear my eyes on your barbed wire facade
Divides of colour and small talk
Medicate for patience
Dig up the graves of our saviours
Civil isolation

It's all gone right to my head
Wondering why we're not all dead
It's safe to say I'm not alone in this
There's something deep within we miss

There's a line in the sand that we won't look past
A cure for the pain but it's out of our grasp
If all we love will leave us asking
Why do we deserve disaster?
Let me know

Please let me know when it's gone
It's really not the best of times
And all we've got is guided by this light within
I'll hold us both until the smoke clears
We're suffocating

Sick of our society
Sick of trying to fit inside a life I cannot lead
Sick of always following
Sick of trying to be another cog in their machine
Sick of running on empty, pushing the blame
Waiting for tomorrow to save us from today
There's no profit in poverty
And I'm running on empty
I'm running on empty
Running myself into the ground
