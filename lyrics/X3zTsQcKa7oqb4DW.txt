from up on the hill I can see the lights
of town through the trees
and there is wind.
there is only wind.
do I disdain them? that "land of dreams"
from up here you can see them living
on the way home, through the trees
I have climbed the hill at twilight
to find the source of wind
from up on the hill
I can see the lights of town
that land of dreams
through the trees
