I'm sorry I didn't reply I was doing things
I didn't think to reply, I'm sorry
It was nice, I was lying on grass with others, lying, squinting
I could barely read my phone with the sunlight
But yes, I read it, sorry

Everyone squinting together, clothes warm on the grass
There was hummus and a frisbee gliding back and forwards over my head
One eye closed, winking, sunlight dappling over their dresses
Messes of spread and crumbs, I didn't think to reply 'till now
I'm just sitting now, don't know what to say

How are you so far away? Is it sunny?
The sun just went down, I thought about you
Days drag slowly when it's warm, softly running ice creams onto the soil
We kicked a ball about, seems like all one moment, motionless

I think about you walking through the door
Quickly smiling and your hand on the handle
Fingers curled and closing, other hand to my hair
I have to go, so much time dragging slowly

Nights asleep I'll try to dream of you
Nights asleep I'll try to dream of you
Nights asleep I'll try to dream of you
Nights asleep I'll-

Under kaleidoscope meshes of fabric
Bodies lifted and wilted and wound and back and forth
Laughter cut the air, their hair twirled with the dresses so far away
Other images float and glisten among the spots of sunlight
Behind closed eyelids, morphing shapes of red and black and white

Legs apart and close again, concealing buildings
Leaning to the air and midges twirling round a fading light
Shadows cast of familiar faces
Place thoughts of love among the thoughts of flying insects
Sex and meshed faces place thoughts of

Open door, quickly smile and get in, fingers curled and closing
One eye closed, one hand closed on another hand holding hair and neck
I missed you
Quickly smile into neck running hands rubbing back
Back and forwards, four times holding neck hair
Folding down over cotton

Breathing sighs (Hands to hold, too hard holding)
Breath dragging ('Cause you must be cold)
Step inside (Hands, thighs, I missed you thirty times over)
(Time holding back hands together)

Billowing sighs and turns thirsty, thirty times
Overborne limbs and tear pillows
Learning again to manage taking time
Making marks on squinting eyes, closing distance
Legs apart from days dragging between them soft pressed lips

Parting time again and down meaning feeling
Feelings pressing pressed lips mark closed eyes and down
Thirty times over
Turn around and soft pillow billowing cotton dragging hands
Between legs apart, from the days apart and nights asleep
Tears meaning apart again

Thousand words, rhythm cracks on cotton hands
Billowing sighs and turns thirsty, thirty times
Overborne limbs and tear pillows
Learning again to manage taking time
Making marks on squinting eyes, closing distance

Legs apart from days dragging, between then soft pressed lips
Parting time, apart from days dragging between them
Time, making marks on squinting eyes, closing distance
Legs apart, pressed lips, parting time again
