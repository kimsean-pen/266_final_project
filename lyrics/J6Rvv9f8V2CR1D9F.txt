Don't cry sister, cry, it'll be alright in the morning
Don't cry sister, cry, everything will be just fine
Don't cry sister cry, it'll be alright, I tell you no lie
Don't cry sister cry, don't do it, don't do it

When old man trouble knocks on your door
Don't give him no key, he just wants more
He'll turn your life to misery
Kick you down, just like me

Cry sister cry, it'll be alright any moment
Don't cry sister cry, everything will be just fine

If you woke downhearted and you feel so bad
Somebody wants something of nothing you had
Love don't come too easy, you see
A little bit of you and a little bit of me

Don't cry, sister cry, it'll be alright, don't do it
Don't cry, sister cry, everything will be just fine
Everything will be just fine
Everything will be just fine

Don't cry, sister cry, don't do it, don't do it
Don't cry, sister cry, don't do it, don't do it
