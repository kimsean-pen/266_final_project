Gold dive diving, diving oh
Gold dive diving, yeah eh eah
Gold dive diving, dive oh
Gold dive diving

Stop the clocks can we just slow it down
He reads your thoughts they go to a higher ground
Invite the guy you like inside the door
Gold, Gold, Gold, Gold, Gold

Let your self be one with the ocean floor
I know gold is not enough, Shes a diamond Im the rough
While Im laying down I try my luck
Dont I know gold is not enough?

To catch her Id have someone like yourself (someone like yourself)
Through crystal balls I dont see no-one else (yeahh)
No I dont feel
No no no no no Heartbeat no x8

Cause gold is not enough,
Shes a diamond Im the rough
While laying down I try my luck
Dont I know gold is not enough?

Oh gold is not enough,
Shes a diamond Im the rough
While laying down I try my luck
Dont I know gold is not enough?

Gold diving
Gold diving
Gold diving
Gold x4
