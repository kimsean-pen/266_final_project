Surely I am willing but I won't
Claiming that I'll do it but I don't
Knowing I'll do anything you want
Pretending I am someone that I'm not

Good god my mind
Won't let me think right
I know you're trouble
But I'm determined to create these things up in my head
that never happened
In time I've gotta choose
Freedom or loyalty
Look at what you've done
What am I gonna do

So now that you have made a mess off me
And showed me stars that
I have never seen
I know it's wrong why does it feel so right
You haven't got me yet
but you might

You're smiling back at me
I wanna do it
I wanna be with you
let me get through it
Am I gonna make it back alive
When you show me all the things that you can do

Good god my mind
Won't let me think right
I know you're trouble
But I'm determined to create
these things up in my head
that never happened
In time I've gotta choose
Freedom or loyalty
Look at what you've done
What am I gonna do

Good god my mind
Won't let me think right
I know you're trouble
But I 'm determined to create
thesethings up in my head
that never happened
In time I've gotta choose Freedom or loyalty
Look at what you've done
What am I gonna do
