Beautiful, you're beautiful
As beautiful as the sun
Wonderful, you're wonderful
As wonderful as they come

And I can't help but feel attached
To the feelings I can't even match
With my face pressed up to the glass
Wanting you

Beautiful, you're beautiful
As beautiful as the sky
Wonderful, it's wonderful
To know that you're just like I

And I'm sure you know me well
As I'm sure you don't
But you just can't tell
Who'll you love and who you won't
No, who'll you love and who you won't

And I love you, as you love me
So let the clouds roll by your face
We'll let the world spin on to another place
We'll climb the tallest tree above it all
To look down on you and me and them

And I'm sure you know me well
As I'm sure you don't
But you just can't tell
Who you'll love and who you won't
No, who'll you love and who you won't
No no, who'll you love and who you won't
No no

Don't let your life wrap up around you
Don't forget to call, whenever
I'll be here just waiting for you
I'll be under your stars forever
Neither here nor there just right beside you
I'll be under the stairs forever
Neither here nor there just right beside you
