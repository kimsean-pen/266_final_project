So now it's time to make things right
We have been doing damage, enough for now
You see, it wasn't always like this
You blame the world, I think she's innocent

You all know how to put me away for good
And how to comfort my shrinking heart

I hear a distant voice speaking
Repeating the same question again
Wish I had an answer to please you all
So that we could seal this day like a letter

You all know how to put me away for good
And how to comfort my crying heart
There should be something worth finding for
But we're too scared to let ourselves seek

You live with a stench, a stench of a rotten soul
Can't open yourself
A master of a self-centered world
Feeling guilty without a reason
Got a storm inside

Calling you now to receive my message
I'm not in need for help, I've got things to do
Deceived and badly hurt, there's so much to do
We are here to wait, we have to wait

You all know how to put me away for good
And how to comfort my crying heart
There should be something worth finding for
But we're too scared to let ourselves seek

You live with a stench, a stench of a rotten soul
Can't open yourself
A master of a self-centered world
Feeling guilty without a reason
Got a storm inside
