I ain't even famous, but she saw me and was starstruck (lots of ice)
I ain't even famous, but she saw me and was starstruck (lots of ice)
Big pride on me, I come beg your pardon?
A boy with a big nine on him, you don't want no problem

Born to die, so alive
See it in your eyes
Cold as ice, whats your choice of p?
Minus priced, the other one I like
She might say she won't, but she might
She be cocaine, wool over your eyes

She gonna see me and drool, over my ice
So la la la, ooh ooh ooh
Is it you, is it you?
Opposition member, we gonna shoot if it's you
I'm present supplying, pressure on youths
And it's true
I'm coming heavy, if I end up in the ready with my troops

I ain't even famous, but she saw me and was starstruck (lots of ice)

Scared of what, afraid of who? (who?)
Saint Laurent, yeah, choos beaming cool (yeah, yeah)
Got enough from a dog, three c's, you doing the two
Want some chat chat, want some tattoos
Mummy said get a job, I got a clue, non saloon
Riding around recliner, seat back
Â£20 for 2
Days in the trap, and if you gotta stick with the plan
Get with the group
I see my niggas, every thing around me new
I ain't famous, she like Lancey is it you?
Every night I long[?] for the devil, and I do not wear a suit
New bitch, and a drink
Sink by the blues[?]
New grip on her, 452

I ain't even famous, but she saw me and was starstruck
