Black on black (yeah, rock go hard)

Bad boy killers
우린 extreme villain
거기 넌 우릴 보고 뭔 생각을 해 speed up 곧
따라 잡히겠지 우린 잡고 잡아내 y'all
Can't better than this call
Bring the noise
NCT gotta go get 'em

NCT we the dream chaser, uh
뱉고 뱉지 배 아픈 애들은 또 say somethin'
NCT we the dream chaser, uh
뱉고 뱉지 배 아픈 애들은 또 say somethin'
Man, our city reap
And our lights never sleeping
우리들의 머리 위 씌어놓지마 limit, who are we?
NCT의 다 모인 빛을 담을만한 size
