You've gotta carry on
You've gotta carry on
You know you've got
To be the one to carry on

You've gotta carry on
You've gotta carry on
It's up to you to shoot the sun
'Cause I'll be gone

You've gotta carry on
You've gotta carry on
You know you've got
To be the one to carry on

If you carry on
You know I'll carry on
It's up to you to shoot the sun
'Cause I'll be gone
