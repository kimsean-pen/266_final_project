I drew a line then crossed it
I wanted a promise of a nicer view
With everything shiny, bright, and new

I saw the light then lost it
I measured the frame, I cut the glass, true
But shadows in motion rearrange view

All I want is something to love
All I want is something to love
All I want is someone to love me like I do

We're building a new religion
A shiny and new religion
Building a new religion
Get on your knees, salvation ain't free

I'll take a modern optic
The right to be free from is a freedom, too
A freedom to dream, a freedom to use

I'll take what I got coming
I'll customize option: red, white and blue
I just hope it does what I expect it to

All I want is something to love
All I want is someone to love me
All I want is someone to love me like I do
Like I do, like I do

We're building a new religion
A shiny and new religion
Building a new religion
Get on your knees, salvation ain't free
