Turn off the alarm
Wonder where you are
I'd be a page in your book if you let me
Miles and miles of drones
Stain in a coffee cup
The truth will start to creep you out if you let it
I wanted to know each part
I wanna to know each part of you

A yellow SUV
Britney spears on the ceiling
You look my way but
You weren't talking to me
Pulling up to Rob's
Some camel lights, Averso
Your tan skin felt like universal envy
And i wanted to know each part
I wanna know each part of you

Give it 13 years
Both your legs up you're crying
Trying to push a life out from your belly
And Im a water boy
Over whelmed by the screaming
Your clenched teeth, nails dug deep into my meaning
And i still wanna know each part
I wanna know each part of you

I still wanna know each part
I wanna know each part of you
Ooh you you
I still wanna know each part
I wanna know each part of you
