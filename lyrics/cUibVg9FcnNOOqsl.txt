Living in this world will bring you to your knees.
The only thing that's promised at
birth a lifetime of endless suffering.
The earth will open up.
We'll engulf in flames.
No guilty.
No innocent.
A name is a name.
You can say your prayers.
They won't be answered.
It's like we're put here just to die.
Humanity is cancer.
Ultimate Annihilation.
Ultimate Annihilation.
Everyone is a fucking victim.
