Young bitch in the club with an attitude
I don't want you feeling, so you got a tude
You keep telling me that I'm not your problem
But you wanna ride it like a helicopter
Young bitch in the club with an attitude
I'm fucking lost, I'm fucking confused
Feel like I'm shiny, like I'm brand new
I'd rather be abused and not really used

So many secrets, I'm kinda full
So many secrets, I'm Tom Cruise
You want Madonna, but I want you
If she a sauna, I'm a steam room

I don't wanna talk, I just wanna
We can do it all night (all night)
We've been through a lot, but you're the one I want
We can do it all night
I don't wanna talk, I just wanna
We can do it all night (all night)
We've been through a lot, but you're the one I want
We can do it all night

Young bitch in the club with a broken fist
Took so many losses, I must like to lose
Going both ways, I don't gotta choose
Going both ways like, ooh, ooh

So many secrets, I'm kinda full
So many secrets, I'm Tom Cruise
You want Madonna, but I want you
If she a sauna, I'm a steam room

I don't wanna talk, I just wanna
We can do it all night (all night)
We've been through a lot, but you're the one I want
We can do it all night, ooh
I don't wanna talk, I just wanna fuck
We can do it all night (all night)
We've been through a lot, but you're the one I want
We can do it all night, ooh
