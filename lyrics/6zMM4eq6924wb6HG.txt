i fell asleep with the television on
i missed all of your phone calls
and slept through the alarm
am i late? am i too late to see you?
are you mad i didn't get to meet you?

with a phone in your pocket and holes in your shoes
you went to monterey without a boy to sing to you
you always said, "this is where i want to
live my life, with or without you."

i'm not gone
you just make it hard to talk

i had a dream that i rose from the dead
and all my fears were flower pedals on my bed
and the wind lifted them off me
as a man spoke to me sofly

he said he lived in a town who washed all their clothes
in a public river with blood drippin' from there toes
are you strong? have you come here to save me?
i said are you real? he said, "i'm as real as you make me"

bum bum badum bum clap your heels when you can
bum bum badum bum just don't thrive on being sad
bum bum badum bum admit when you've done your wrongs
bum bum badum bum and you know i've done a lot
bum bum badum bum i'm so sorry that i left
bum bum badum bum before i told you what you meant
bum bum badum bum tell your family i said hi
bum bum badum bum i hope they're doing fine

i just wanted to say i hope you're okay
and i hope everything worked itself out along the way
you are strong, because you were there to save me
you are real, yeah you're as real as you made me
