Baby, seasons change but people don't
And I'll always be waiting in the back of the room
I'm boring but overcompensate
With headlines and flash, flash, flash photography

But don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me.

Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee
Style your wake for fashion magazines
Widow or a divorcee
Don't pretend, d-d-don't pretend

We don't fight fair
We don't fight fair

They say your head can be a prison
Then these are just conjugal visits
People will dissect us
Till this doesn't mean a thing anymore

Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me

Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee
Style your wake for fashion magazines whoaa
Widow or a divorcee
Don't pretend, d-d-don't pretend

We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places, whoa
We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places
We don't fight fair
We don't fight fair
We don't fight fair
We don't fight fair
We don't fight fair

We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places, whoa
We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places
We don't fight fair
With smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places
We don't fight fair
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me we don't fight fair
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
We don't fight fair
