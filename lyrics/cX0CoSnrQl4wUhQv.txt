Hear about the President?
He used to smoke pot
He never broke the law
Cause he never got caught

It's a sign of the times, it's the ultimate crime
Guilty of being caught red handed
The roll of the dice says you're gonna do time
Guilty of being caught red handed

Junkie drug dealer does 50 years time
While the millionare murderer just pays a fine

It's a sign of the times
It's the ultimate crime
Guilty of being caught red handed
The roll of the dice says you're gonna do time
Guilty of being caught red handed

I'll pretend not to see
Why you pretend you don't do
I'm innocent like you

So many stupid laws
Gonna have to break a few
Speed or run a red light i might too
When the man pulls you over like it or not
You're just one of the many
Only you got caught

It's a sign of the times, It's the ultimate crime
Guilty of being caught red handed
The roll of the dice says you're gonna do time
Guilty of being caught red handed

I'll pretend not to see
What you pretend you don't do
I'm innocent

It's a sign of the times, It's the ultimate crime
Guilty of being caught red handed
The roll of the dice says you're gonna do time
Guilty of being caught red handed
