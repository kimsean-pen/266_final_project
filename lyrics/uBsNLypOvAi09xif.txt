Circle of eyes, ball of judgement
Doomed to seek these broken lands
Circles... wheels of dry eyes
Released to embitter the sweetest of secrets

Lead me to those drowning and I shall bring water

You cannot fail, nor can you win,
for the fruits of your womb are cursed
Cursed with the blindness of your prey

Circle of sight, ball of judgement lurking,
between everything and everything and nothing and nothing
and in and around and above yet beneath
and everything and everything and nothing and nothing
and in and around and above yet beneath

We are your burden, just like you are ours,
yet are you the key to our salvation

Lead me to the hungry and I shall bring air

Circle of eyes, in sight boundless,
in greatness immeasurable,
in essence infinite,
in judgements pure as death

Lead me to the thirsty and I shall bring earth

You cannot win, nor can you fail,
for the fruits of your womb are blessed
Blessed with the blindness of your prey

Now lead me to those who are burnt by sin and I shall bring fire
