They say they're gonna
Love you to the end of time
But they're not, no they're not
They say they're gonna
Try to keep an open mind
But they're not, no they're not

And they'll promise kids
And they'll promise love
They'll try to teach you things,
Things you already know

(Boyfriends)

Try to sing you songs
About the open skies
But they're not, no they're not
Write you letters saying
That their gonna die
But they're not, no they're not

And they might need a pet
They might need a mom
They're gonna come with threats
About you staying young

Let's get you out of here
Let's get you out of here
There's no need my dear
Let's get you out of here

(Boyfriends)

They say they'll try to release
You from the golden smile
But they're not, no they're not
They say their gonna keep
You from dramatic cries
But they're not, no they're not

And they'll become their dicks
Puke on your heart
They're gonna make you sick
It's gonna get real dark

Let's get you out of here
Let's get you out of here
There's no need my dear
Let's get you out of here

(Boyfriends...)

(Men today can't live in living rooms
They can't live in living rooms)
