You think that I'm the type of guy that's fly, don't ya?
Come to Colorado, join the mile high, won't ya?
I'm in the corner of the bar in the booth sippin' Vermouth
Come and find me if you want the proof, poof
I can make you disappear like David Blaine, watch me
Sorry if I came off a little cocky
I'm just a dude sippin' whiskey casually out of a flask
In the back of your wedding, gettin' smashed

You shot me down in the middle of the night
You had me right in the crosshairs of your sight
You watch the smoke disappear into the light
A kamikaze flying in a Dogfights

I could say that I saw it from a mile away
But I lost who I am in a ball of flames
And I should've known you were bad on the day you came
Yeah, we crash landed, everything was lost
My heart tells a story like a black box

I hope you enjoed the lyrics!
