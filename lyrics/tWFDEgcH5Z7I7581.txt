My statues are falling
Like feathers of snow
Their voices are calling
In a whispering world
Waiting for the morning glow

Heaven is calling
From a rainy shore
Counting wounded lights falling
Into their dreams
Still searching for an open door

In morning dew
A glorious scene came through
Like war is over now
I feel I'm coming home again
Pure moments of thought
In the meaning of love
This war is over now
I feel I'm coming home again

An arrow of freedom
Is piercing my heart
Breaking chains of emotion
Give a moment to pray
For lost innocence to find it's way

Fields of sensation
A cry in the dark
Hope is on the horizon
With a reason to stay
And living for a brand new day

Salaam Allah alad donia alal'insaan (salute God and bless life and humans)
Ah ah oh ah
Mata nahia behob ou aman (When will we live in love and safety)
Salaam Allah, Salaam Allah (salute God, salute God)
Salaam Allah alad donia alal'insaan (salute God and bless life and humans)

In morning dew
A glorious scene came through
Like war is over now
I feel I'm coming home again
Pure moments of thought
In the meaning of love
This war is over now
I feel I'm coming home again to you
