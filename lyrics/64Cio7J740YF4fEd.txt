There was nothin' on earth that a girl could do
The first minute I laid my eyes on you, on you
Turned sheets to the wind, I was all confused
Like burnin' my money, nothin' left to lose
I knew, I was doomed

An attraction I just can't explain
But I knew I was never gonna be the same
I'd be lyin' if I said that I always chose what was good
So where we're gonna go in your Shelby '68?

I know you're gonna break my heart
When I get in your car
Oh, the trouble I'm in when we take that spin
Yeah, I'm in
I know there'll be hell to pay
Baby, I just can't wait
Oh, I'm gonna get high when I take that ride
In your Shelby '68

I was rollin' with my very own Steve McQueen
When you were hittin' that road
And I was livin' the dream
So it seemed
Like a diamond buried in the dead of night, yeah
I knew it was wrong but it felt so right to me
Can't you see?

An attraction I just can't explain
But I knew I was never gonna be the same
I'd be lyin' if I said that I always chose what was good
So where we're gonna go in that Shelby '68?

I know you're gonna break my heart
When I get in your car
Oh, the trouble I'm in when we take that spin
Yeah, I'm in
I know there'll be hell to pay
Baby, I just can't wait
Oh, I'm gonna get high when I take that ride
In your Shelby '68, yeah
I just can't wait

Burn rubber baby, get on with this show
I'll take a ride if it's your rodeo
The horses are wild and I'll cry, but I'm ready to go
Let's go
Longest of days and the starriest nights
Rockin' the road and the moon and those lights
No destination, we're racin' baby, just drive
Drive
Take me away in your Shelby '68

I know you're gonna break my heart
When I get in your car
Oh, the trouble I'm in when we take that spin
Yeah, I'm in
I know there'll be hell to pay
Baby, I just can't wait
Oh, I'm gonna get high when I take that ride
In your Shelby '68

Ooh, I just can't wait
There'll be hell to pay
You'll take me away
Oh Shelby '68
