The first god: had in his garden, from the back, looked like
a household pet--but when it was twirled 'round was revealed to

Do a dance here
SMALL SMALL LOCATION
GARDEN garden
NEVER since birth not eaten in a day
Never since courtship stayed up some nights
HE had the 'Kingdom of Evil' book under a German history book--

THE second god, lives by fountains that flowed, by the blue shiny
lit
roads. Had forgot, what others still try to grasp.

Perdition.
He's here. I saw him I swear on the thingy floor:
up on the brown baize lift shaft he's here! He's here at last!
