You go to school
To learn the rules
On how to love and life your life
But think about it twice

The pusher push, the fixer fix
The judge acquits
The junkie leads his life
For the dollar bill

You don't buy a life, you live a life
A father learns much too late
He was a-never home
He worked two jobs, never stayed at home
He had to, 'cause
His love life was gone

For the dollar bill
For the dollar bill
For the dollar bill
US dollar bill

It'll buy a war
It will save a land
It pollutes this air
In the name of wealth
It'll buy you life
But not true life
The kind of life
Where the soul is hard
My name is dollar Bill
