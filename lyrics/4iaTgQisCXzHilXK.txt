'Cause I found love in you
Doing it right, doing it right
I'll walk the world for you
Doing it right, doing it right
Seconds, minutes, hours, lifetimes
Doing it right, doing it right
I found love in you
Doing it right, doing it right

Hands up for a miracle
Up high for a miracle
Oh the smoke don't stop but we let it go
But we let it go on and on

Flash back to a year ago
Count stacks, fifty-two ago
All the hope, drop down like a domino
But we let it go on and on

Will someone take a ride with me?
Back to the world where we can see
Echo strong, river deep
Concrete hazy
Won't you take a ride with me?
Take a ride with me

It's easy come never go
Please make way for telephones
Call me crazy, call me slow
Go hang up but
Won't you take a ride with me?
Come on take a ride with me

'Cause I found love in you
Doing it right, doing it right
I'll walk the world for you
Doing it right, doing it right
Seconds, minutes, hours, lifetimes
Doing it right, doing it right
I found love in you
Doing it right, doing it right

Hands up for a miracle
Up high for a miracle
Oh the smoke don't stop but we let it go
But we let it go on and on

Flash back to a year ago
Count stacks, fifty-two ago
All the hope, drop down like a domino
But we let it go on and on

Will someone take a ride with me?
Back to the planet sanity
Desert plain, ocean wave
Techno crazy
Won't you take a ride with me?
Take a ride with me

It's easy come, never go
Please make way for climaphobes
Two degrees, you're spilling seas
Toup√©e queen
Oh won't you take a ride with me?
Come on take a ride with me

Swing sweet light this earth of mine

'Cause I found love in you
Doing it right, doing it right
I'll walk the world for you
Doing it right, doing it right
Seconds, minutes, hours, lifetimes
Doing it right, doing it right
I found love in you
Doing it right, doing it right

Swing sweet light this earth of mine
