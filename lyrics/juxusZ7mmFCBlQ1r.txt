Early in the year
Feeling
Fade away
Something has clearly gone today
Don't know what I can give
But I know, I know, I know
It's the worst way to put you in a song
And I knew it as the words came
All of this is wrong
Early in the year
But I know, I know, I know
That you nearly heal
In the feeling, that fades away
There's something clearly gone today
Don't know what wanna heal
But I know, I know, I know
It's the worst way to put you in a song
And I knew it as the words came
All of this is wrong
Early in the year
But I know, I know, I know
Even when the love's gone
Don't I show it
Even when the love comes
Baby, don't I know it
And even when the love's gone
Baby, don't I show it
Even when your love comes
Baby, don't I know it
And even when the love's gone
Baby, don't I show it
Even when your love comes
Baby, don't I know it
And even when the love's gone
Don't I show it
And even when the light's on
Someting's wrong, and don't I know it
You don't have to tell me nothing
'cause you know that you've already shown it
And even when you're good and strong
The feeling's gone, and don't I know it
Even when the love is gone,
The night turns, she can try to show it
Oh why, why, oh, why, why, don't I know it
Oh why, why, oh, why, why, don't I show it
Don't I know it
Oh, why, why, don't I show it
Don't I show it
