Ooh
Hit him with a little bit of crazy
Hit him a little bit of love
Let him know that I'm not leaving
Looking at the stars in the sky
Feel they're far away
Whatcha trying to say
Show me where the love is gone
Try to leave my heart alone
You're the one for me
(Did you know?)
You're the one for me
(Can you show it?)
Show me where the love is gone
Hit him with a little bit of uptight
Hit him with a little bit of faith
Let him know that I'm a grown man
But I feel it
I don't mind growing old
I don't mind asking why
When you're here, by
My, my (N/A)
Show me where the love is gone
Try to leave my heart alone
You're the one for me
(Did you know?)
Show me where the love is gone
You're the one for me
(Can you show it?)
Try to leave my heart alone
I'm gonna to tell you, tell,
I'm gonna tell you how I feel
I'm gonna love you, love,
I'm gonna love you till you're here
I'm gonna tell you, tell,
I'm gonna tell you how I feel
I'm gonna love you, love
I'm gonna love you till you're here
Try to leave my heart alone
You're the one for me
(Did you know?)
Show me where the love is gone
You're the one for me
(Can you show it?)
Try to leave my heart alone
You're the one for me
(Did you know?)
Show me where the love is gone
You're the one for me
(Can you show it?)
Try to leave my heart alone
