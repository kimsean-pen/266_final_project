Well, you can ride on the crest of a wave
If that's where you want to be
But does the look on your face
Mean you're really feeling happy?

Or do you feel like you're standing on a wooden leg
Or a poor man much too proud to beg
Or a page from a book that can't be read at all?

You gotta see by the way
That they are talking
That it's time for you
To pick up your grip start walking

'Cause they want to see your long legs flying
Go to the place where the earth meets the sky and
Don't stop to turn around and wave goodbye at all

They won't be satisfied
Till you're out of their sight
But I wonder how will you feel
With a deck of cards
You're not around to deal
You're not around to deal

They won't be satisfied
Till you're out of their sight
But I wonder how will you feel
With a deck of cards
You're not around to deal?
You're not around to deal

Well, they say it's a lie, a joke
That you are living
But you know one thing they don't
You won't give in

'Cause you're like a cat, chasin' its tail
Makes a million circles but you're gonna fail
Look down you just don't understand

Well, you can ride on the crest of a wave
If that's where you want to be
But does the look on your face
Mean you're really feeling happy?

Well, do you feel like you're standing on a wooden leg
A poor man much too proud to beg
Or a page from a book that can't be read at all?

Well, do you feel like you're standing on a wooden leg
Or a poor man much too proud to beg
Or a page from a book that can't be read at all?
