In place of feeling lost
Only temporary
You were laying on the floor
Any other place
It would be a crime
I can't take it anymore

It was never meant to change
You would trust it to a moment
You won't feel this again
I can't explain

Used to wake up at night
I'd touch your sleeping face
You were laying on the floor
Those were the only times
Didn't live a selfish life
I can't take it anymore
