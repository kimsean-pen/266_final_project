All the colours that we saw they touched us
All the trails that they made we followed
We can be just like all of the others
We have to be just like all of the others

All the spaces they made for us
Are all filled up
And they will deceive us and they will desert us
But all our colours will always be with us
And all our colours they will always be with us

All our colors will always be with us...
