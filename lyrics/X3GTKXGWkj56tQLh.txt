It stood and got flyin' in the air
Well, most of us with our dreams that strayed
Me, I was just heading anywhere
Oh, I'd escape on a perilous game
Leave it all behind
For yesterday

Some of us didn't make it through
Some were beat by a mental stress
I had my brothers to look up to
I was the fortunate one, I guess
And it's all gone now
For yesterday
Yes, it's all gone now
For yesterday

To all of you who aren't past your prime
To all of you in the dirt and grime
To all of you who got lost in time
For yesterday

Life's journey's long like a marathon
If it's gonna stay you and me
Twenty-four years of hangin' on
Don't want our love to be a fading memory
Lost and gone
For yesterday

To all of you who aren't past your prime
To all of you in the dirt and grime
To all of you who got lost in time
For yesterday
For yesterday

To all of you who aren't past your prime
To all of you in the dirt and grime
To all of you who never had a time
To all of you who got stuck and cried
To all of you who got lost in time
For yesterday
For yesterday
