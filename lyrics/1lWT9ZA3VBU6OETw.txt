You were always searching for deliverance
Blatant misconceptions that you made
My overall perception of this dream
Is that I'll die before I wake

At another place in time
You were infinitely mine
Relatively alright
When Berenstein was fine
At another place in time
Only parallel to mine
The universe was alright
When Berenstein was fine

You were always certain that it did exist
Imagination so intrinsic all at stake
All the things we said when we were younger
Did it bend or did I break?

At another place in time
You were infinitely mine
Relatively alright
When Berenstein was fine
At another place in time
Only parallel to mine
The universe was alright
When Berenstein was fine

Wait for me, wait for me there
I'll die if you die, wait for me I swear
Wait for me I'm still somewhere
You're getting older and I'm getting scared
Wait for me, wait for me there
I'll die if you die, wait for me I swear
Wait for me I'm still somewhere
You're getting older without me, I'm scared

At another place in time
You were infinitely mine
Relatively alright
When Berenstein was fine
At another place in time
Only parallel to mine
The universe was alright
When Berenstein was fine

At another place in time
Only parallel to mine
The universe was alright
When Berenstein was fine
