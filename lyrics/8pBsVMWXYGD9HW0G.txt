Beyond time I traveled.
No space has bound me.
Follow the will I know.
The eternal order revealed.

Past my dreams, all doubt disappeared, my vision became clear.
Treachery is the poison and the union is in our blood.

The king, with beak and talons.
The king, in the form of man.
Nothing escapes those eyes.
He sees everything.
