Another hand on your heart, with borrowed time
Your skin was cold, your soul was ice
You only want what you tangle, inside your bones
Your head will blow, like a cannonball

How can you break if you got no bones?
How can you wag if you got no dog?

But all you want you just feel, no world outside
Stay with my bones, stay 'til you like
We're only plastic toys, break down to size
Stay with my bones, stay 'til you like

How can you break if you got no bones?
How can you wag if you got no dog?
I don't wanna waste my life
'Til the tables turn

Gonna skin it all down, to the ground
You're gonna skin it all down, to the ground
You're gonna skin it all down, to the ground
You're gonna skin it all down, to the ground
