I've got miles of regrets and confusing friends
But perhaps it's just my stupid head in the end
Thinking, should i wait here or make my way home?
You said go (you said go)
Making up problems that don't exist
Why do I let myself dream like this?
We're floating away, my body's in space
We are going home
Missing pieces of my skull
I'll sew on patches of my own soul
There's nothing you or i can do so let the stars fall
Cause from up here the sky's my thoughts and were all so small
(Instrumental)
Meteor shower, quick take cover
But the hues in our hair compliment one another
I'd sell my own bones for sapphire stones
Cause blue's your favorite color
(Missing pieces of my skull)
(I'll sew on patches of my own soul)
There's nothing you or i can do so let the stars fall
Cause from up here the sky's my thoughts and were all so small
We'all so

My heart and the earth share the same rule
It starts with Love and it ends with U
But don't go outside, it's dangerous tonight
Without me here right by your side
(Take it slow, you'll know)
(Which way to go)
(Sew up your skull take your time)
(And we'll be just fine)

Missing pieces of my skull
I'll sew on patches of my own soul
