All of things you said shouldn't fail you now
Unless you're looking for a miracle
Out of the light, we lost you in the crowd
You never found us a miracle

You can fail me now
You can leave me now
You can let me down
But you'll never know
All of your self control
Denied you the light, put you in a hole
How come that no one knows
You have a heart, but do you have a soul

You need someone to tell
You need someone to hold
Cus this love
What are you waiting for
You need someone to tell
You need someone to hold
Cus this love
What are you waiting for

How do we light the torch and pass it round
We need something that's flammable
You and I conspire and split the ground
This is all so critical

You can fail me now
You can leave me now
You can let me down
But you'll never know

All of your self control
Denied you the light, put you in a hole
How come that no one knows
You have a heart, but do you have a soul

You need someone to tell
You need someone to hold
Cus this love
What are you waiting for
You need someone to tell
You need someone to hold
Cus this love
What are you waiting for

You need someone to tell
You need someone to hold
Cus this love
What are you waiting for
You need someone to tell
You need someone to hold
Cus this love
What are you waiting for
