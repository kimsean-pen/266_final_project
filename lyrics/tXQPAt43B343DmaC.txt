You've got a lot of nerve
When you're trying to call me out
But we both know very well
You're the one with the big mouth
I thought that I liked you
And your mom and daddy too
But now I know that
I want no part of them or you

It's not my fault
It's not my fault like you say it is
It's not my fault 'cause I told you long ago
That I wouldn't put up with your bullshit

You don't come through
Like you say you do
Now I don't need you to
'Cause I don't need you
You don't come through
Like you say you do
Now I don't need you to
'Cause I don't need you
Don't need you
Don't need you

You think you've played me
For a fool (For a fool)
When really you've just made yourself
Look like a stupid tool
I know it must be hard to see
You're not my cup of tea
That's just what happens
When you're way too cool

It's not my fault, no, no
It's not my fault like you say it is
It's not my fault 'cause I told you long ago
That I wouldn't put up with your bullshit

You don't come through
Like you say you do
Now I don't need you to
'Cause I don't need you
You don't come through
Like you say you do
Now I don't need you to
'Cause I don't need you
Don't need you
Don't need you

Boy, I think it's time
I think it's time I let you know
Yeah, I think it's time
I think it's time I let you go
Boy, I think it's time
I think it's time I let you know
Boy, I think it's time
I think it's time I let you go

You don't come through
Like you say you do
Now I don't need you to
'Cause I don't need you
You don't come through
Like you say you do
Now I don't need you to
'Cause I don't need you

Don't need you
Don't need you
Don't need you
I don't need you
