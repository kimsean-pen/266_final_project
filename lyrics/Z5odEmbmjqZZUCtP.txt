One time in your life
You've got the route in hand but the map is stuck
They said it's not your fault the tires are tired
The camera moves and your driver's been pulled
And I
Well, I have always felt this
And I could never
I could never hear it

So I turned it up and turned it on and turned it down
Always the volume, always the words
Review the press and tell it like it is
Your life is hype, your love is hype
And I
Well, I will clench my own fist
And I will always
I will always wait

There's more, there's more than blood
That beats through my heart
My hands
And my feet
Stuck between my tongue and my teeth

We don't know
So we wait for tomorrow
We don't know
So we wait for tomorrow
We don't know
So we only go forward

Two times in your life, you will trace the edge
Sink your toes in
Review my press and tell it like it is
My life is hype, my love is hype
And I
Well, I will clench my own fist
And I will always
I will always wait

Well, there's more, there's more than blood
That beats through my heart
Well, My hands
And my feet
Stuck between my tongue and my teeth

We don't know
So we wait for tomorrow
We don't know
So we wait for tomorrow
We don't know
So we only go forward

I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I'd wait up all night
For you
I'd wait up all night
For you
I'd wait up all night
For you

We don't know
So we wait for tomorrow
We don't know
So we wait for tomorrow
We don't know
So we only go forward
