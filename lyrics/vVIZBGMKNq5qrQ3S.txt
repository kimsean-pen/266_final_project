We walked too fast to see everything that's close to us we hold dear
I'll kiss you goodbye when
You are safe from harm and I know you are here

Why'd you have to go so soon?
Cause it's not fair to underestimate my love

For you,
If I'm gonna work hard
For you,
And if I'm gonna take my time
For you,
If it's gonna be now
For you
Where do I go from here?

Remember how we were
Running so fast we could hardly breathe in
Hold my hand, I'll take you
To the days of sun, we were kids playing free

But why'd you have to go so soon?
Cause it's not fair to underestimate my love

For you
If I'm gonna work hard
For you,
And if I'm gonna take my time
For you,
If it's gonna be now
For you
Where do I go from here?

Let me try
Cause it won't hurt me
And if I work it out
Then let me try
Cause it won't hurt me
And if I work it out
Then let me try
Cause it won't hurt me
And if I work it out

For you
If I'm gonna work hard
For you,
And if I'm gonna take my time
For you,
If it's gonna be now
For you
Where do I go from here?
