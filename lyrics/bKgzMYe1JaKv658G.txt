We go back a long, long way
And it seems like yesterday
When the words are spoken
Or whispered in your ear
Take me to the top

Things have changed since we first met
You alone are more than I expect
But the good outweighs the bad
By 110 percent

You take me to the top
You're everything I've got
You catch me if I'm falling, oh, all the way
You take me to the top
You catch me if I'm falling

Some things go in circles
Some thing's in the air
You know just what I'm feeling
You can make the difference
You know I really care

You take me to the top
You're everything I've got
You catch me if I'm falling, oh, all the way
You take me to the top
You catch me if I'm falling, oh

If I could dream a dream with a happy end
You'd be in it every night again and again
Right here by my side, you would never go away
But when I'm awake, I sing, I say

You take me to the top
You're everything I've got
You catch me if I'm falling, oh, all the way
You take me to the top
You catch me if I'm falling, oh

You take me to the top
You catch me if I'm falling, oh, all the way
You're everything I've got
You catch me if I'm falling, oh, all the way

You take me to the top
You catch me if I'm falling, oh, all the way
You're everything I've got
You catch me if I'm falling, oh, all the way

You take me to the top
You catch me if I'm falling, oh, all the way
You're everything I've got
You catch me if I'm falling, oh, all the way

You take me to the top
You catch me if I'm falling
