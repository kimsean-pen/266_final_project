Running, beyond the speed of sound
Calling, beyond the speed of sound
Say you love me, say you love yourself
Say you need me, say you care
Say you want me, say you want yourself
Say you want to be with me well

Christeen, that's all I ask of you

Falling, into the open doorway
Loving, what anyone else would loathe here...
Say you're with me, say you're with yourself
Say you're lonely, say you care
Say you warned me, say you warned yourself
Say you want to be with me well

Christeen, that's all I ask of you

Are you feeling okay?
Are you feeling so much pain
That never goes away
Oh, we know, and we're feeling so much better than before
What's more, is that feeling isn't failing anymore...
