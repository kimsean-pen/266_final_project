Feel the adrenaline moving under my skin
It's an addiction, such an eruption
Sound is my remedy feeding me energy
Music is all I need

Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care

She's been a crazy dita disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick?
Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her

Who's that chick?
Who's that chick?

Who's that chick?
Who's that chick?

Who's that chick?
Who's that chick?

Back on the dancefloor
Bad enough to take me home
Bass kicking so hard
Blazing through my beating heart
French kissin' on the floor
Heart is beating hardcore
Everybody's getting a little tipsy off the crazy Goose
This will end up on the news

Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care

She's been a crazy dita disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick?
Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her

Who's that chick?
Who's that chick?

Who's that chick?
Who's that chick?

Who's that chick?
Who's that chick?

Ultra sexual the night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up, oh yeah
My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum
