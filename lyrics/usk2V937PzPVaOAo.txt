Drifting out in the morning we are
With our eyes to the moon
Gravity pulls ever on
We take a ride on the waves

Can we dive
The fire drifts on the waves
Can you see it now
Can you see it now
It's our ghost town

The tempest has dragged us too far
With the last breath in my lungs
I surrender myself to the sea
But I belong here

Can we dive
The fire drifts on the waves
Can you see it now
Can you see it now
It's our ghost town
