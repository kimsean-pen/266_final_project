She'd rather let the ocean take her inside it's wake
Let the water fill her lungs like the air she hates to breathe
Now lost at sea
Rise, rise above the tides
The waves will pull you under if you don't fight

Slowly sinking to the bottom of the sea

Now lost at sea

Rise, rise above the tides
The waves will pull you under if you don't fight
Rise, rise above the tides

We're lost forever
Lost together
We're lost forever
Lost together

She'd rather let the ocean take her inside it's wake
Let the water fill her lungs like the air she hates to breathe
Now lost at sea
Find the strength to be
The waves will pull you down, underneath to

Rise, rise above the tides
The waves will pull you under if you don't fight
Rise, rise above the tides
Don't allow yourself to give up on life
