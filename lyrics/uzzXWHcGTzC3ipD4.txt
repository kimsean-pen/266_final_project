Giddy up, giddy it up
Giddy up, giddy up

Wanna move into a fool's gold room
With my pulse on the animal jewels
Of the rules that you choose to use to get loose
With the luminous moves
Bored of these limits, let me get, let me get it like

Wow!
It's like right now
It's like wow!
It's like right, right now
It's like wow!
It's like right now
It's like wow!
It's like right now
Oh wow

It's my life, your life
Live it once, can't live it twice
So nice, so nice
Song's like a tidal wave, take you on a getaway
My friends, your friends
Love 'em every day like it's just about to end
Now we're pissin' in the wind cause it's so pine fresh
Like now
Yeah I, I wanna get it like

Wow!
It's like right now
It's like wow!
It's like
Giddy up!
Wow!
It's like right now
Wow!
Oh wow, it's like right now

It's your life
Falling like a hot knife
Call your wife; secular times, these times
My demon's on the cell phone
To your demons, nothing's even right or wrong
It's irrelevant, elephant in the room goes boom
Standing on a line doin' jiu jitsu
Girl in the bikini with the Lamborghini shih tzu

It's your life
You gotta try to get it right
Look around, don't forget where you came from
It's just another perfect night
We're gonna take it around the world
We're gonna take it around the world
When this one is over
I lose my emotions
We're gonna take it around the world

Like
Wow, wow, wow
Like
Giddy up!
Giddy up!
Wow!
