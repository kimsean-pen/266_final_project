I feel heavy, I feel weighted
And I feel hungry, I feel wasted (oh)
I can't put my finger on my feelings
Put my ear to the ceiling, where is that coming from?
Where are you coming from?

I'm just waiting for the walls of my insides to come clean
I've been praying for the day that my spirit is finally free
Some days it feels like the ocean lies inside of me
Lies inside of me

And I feel paralysed, been cut down to size
I hardly have the strength, to open up my eyes
Coz I am swollen, and this has stolen my sanity
Well it's hard to see beyond this when it's fighting against me
Yeah!

I'm just waiting for the walls of my insides to come clean
I've been praying for the day that my spirit is finally free
Some days it feels like the ocean lies inside of me
Lies inside of me

The waves crash in, the tide rolls out
I stand before my weakness now
You took my faith and cut me down
The ocean it lies, it lies inside me now!

The ocean!
The ocean!

I'm just waiting for the walls of my insides to come clean
I've been praying for the day that my spirit
I'm just waiting for the walls of my insides to come clean
I've been praying for the day that my spirit is finally free
Some days it feels like the ocean lies inside of me
Lies inside of me
