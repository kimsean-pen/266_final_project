Cold champagne
We're dancing
We feel sixteen tonight
You're silken
Fire like skin
We're both afraid to die
I said I won't let you down
You close your eyes and turn around

We're awake and it's morning
Still high out of our minds
Pull all of
The shades down
Let's sleep until it's night

We wear our secrets so close
And I don't know why I've told you the most
But there's so much more to go

You can put your death wish away
And we could push some pulse into our veins
And we could put our death wish away
But we're so lost inside these porcelain veins
