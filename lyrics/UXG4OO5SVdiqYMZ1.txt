Priest are you there
Can you hear my voice
Do you hear my prayers
Are you out there
Forgive me Priest, for I have sinned
(I know not what I do)

Mother I am here
I can hear your song
I can feel your fear
He's done you wrong
Temptation fed his own desires
In the ring of fire (in the ring of fire)
Tonight!

I would have loved you for a thousand years
I would have died for you
I would have sacrificed it all my dear
I would have bled for you

Till death do us part
You were unholy right from the start
It's a nice night for a black wedding
It's a nice night for a black wedding

I heard your cry and I just knew
I never meant to forsake you
Mother there's no reason to repent
(I know not what you do)

I heard the bells and I just knew
An angel once now a ghost of you
Deliver me from my own desires
From my ring of fire (from my ring of fire)
Tonight!

I would have loved you for a thousand years
I would have died for you
I would have sacrificed it all my dear
I would have bled for you

Till death do us part
You were unholy right from the start
It's a nice night for a black wedding
It's a nice night for a black wedding
(Nice night for a black wedding)
(Nice night for a black wedding)
(Nice night for a black wedding)
(Nice night for a black wedding)

Come on!

I would have loved you for a thousand years
I would have died for you
I would have sacrificed it all my dear
I would have bled for you

Till death do us part
You were unholy right from the start
It's a nice night for a black wedding
It's a nice night for a black wedding
(Nice night for a black wedding)
(Nice night for a black wedding)
(Nice night for a black wedding)
(Nice night for a black wedding)

In my name shall they cast out demons
They shall speak in new tongues
They shall take up serpents
And if they drink any deadly poison
It shall in no wise hurt them
They shall lay hands on the sick
And they shall recover
The serpent is only brought into the Holy Sanctum
And only handled
If the Holy Ghost
Of the Holy Spirit
Speak directly to the Disciple
