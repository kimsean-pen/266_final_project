My mother taught me to ask questions
She said, "That boyfriend will not do"
I talked yet I still never listened
Somehow she always still rings true
I counted the days until my birthday
Some cosmic adventures will ensue
I drove my mom along the highways
Down roads, we never changed the tune
She said leave your past tomorrow
And don't leave those skulls to dry
Don't fill your holes with sorrow
'Cause you'll never be left alive
Bend those rules, they're so thin
And I'm talking to the window
It's not safe, it's not safe
Just don't lean on me tomorrow
I question what's between the trees
I feel the earth beneath the greens
I wonder what's between the oceans
The ones, she points them out to me
She said leave your past tomorrow
And don't leave those skulls to dry
Don't fill your holes with sorrow
'Cause you'll never be left alive
Bend those rules, they're so thin
And I'm talking to the window
It's not safe, it's not safe
Just don't lean on me tomorrow
It's not safe, it's not safe
It's not safe, it's not safe
It's not safe, it's not safe
It's not safe
