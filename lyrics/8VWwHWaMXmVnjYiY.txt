I have seen the art of my stupid counterpart, the proportion's wrong
Every line, I'm sure, the erase marks, like a sore thumb, swelling and cumbersome
Still, the prints get made, though I really want to say that I've got her beat
I never speak

When our playdate ends, do you call your other friends, or do you go home?
Do you lock your door, do you lay down on your carpet counting friends 'til you get to one?

Once you've sat with kids, it's so hard to leave the table for the kids full-grown
And my, I've grown
So bury me deep
They're not even full grown
They're not even full

Once you've sat with kids, it's so hard to leave the table for the kids full-grown
And my, I've grown
So bury me deep
