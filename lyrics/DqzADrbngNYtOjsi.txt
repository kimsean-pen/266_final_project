Home with my headphones on
And with the stuff on the floor
And the lock on my door

10: 28 on the digital clock
I know it's late but I just can't stop
All this jumpin' around, all this wastin' time
It's getting to be a habit of mine

You would think I didn't wanna get paid
I'm not the type to procrastinate
But a girl can't always be well behaved

I wanna stay home with my headphones on
With the stuff on the floor and the lock on my door
I lost my keys in the mess I made
So I can't go anywhere anyway
So rock on with the headphones on

Got a lot of nothin' to do
I'm not getting it done and I'm lovin' it too
Twenty four hours since I've been outside
But it feels okay, it feels alright

I could go to school another day
Don't understand why I dance all day
You know what they say about
All work and no play

I wanna stay home with my headphones on
With the stuff on the floor and the lock on my door
I lost my keys in the mess I made
So I can't go anywhere anyway
So rock on with the headphones on
With the headphones on

It's like fireworks in my head
Above the clouds, I may never get to bed
Can't turn back now, don't wanna come down

You would think I didn't wanna get paid
I'm not the type to procrastinate
But a girl can't always be well behaved

I wanna stay home with my headphones on
With the stuff on the floor and the lock on my door
I lost my keys in the mess I made
So I can't go anywhere anyway

I wanna stay home with my headphones on
With the stuff on the floor and the lock on my door
I lost my keys in the mess I made
So I can't go anywhere anyway

Rock on with the headphones on
With the headphones on
With the headphones on
