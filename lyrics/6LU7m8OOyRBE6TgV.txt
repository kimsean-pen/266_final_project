He was searching
Blindly night and day
This life then past, no more
Breaking in the, just to stay awake
His heart was like a stone
Uuuh, his heart looked like a stone

And on the last
He walked out in the sun
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day
And on the last day
When all this work was done
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day

All the structure
Right here all along
In scraps, he took away
All this colour
In his final breath
It's in the dark and gray

Uuuh, it's on the dark and day
And on the last
He walked out in the sun
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day
And on the last day
When all this work was done
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day
