Like a window
That blew open
Let the sunlight
And fresh air in

From the woodwork
Psych the structure
Cold and rigid
And too tame

You burst in like
Wild magnolia
Your white flower
Speak your name

Cosmic teacher
Handsome jester
Your brief meadow
Came and went

Drift like cotton
On a soft wind
Now our mother
Closed the window

We'll always love you, pure jolly
They'll never taste our blue noses
We'll always love you, pure jolly
They'll never taste our blue noses

Eeeeeee...

We'll always love you, pure jolly
(Mmm)
They'll never taste oh blue noses
