Nothing comes between us
But a piece of latex
When you tear my clothes off
Like I was a paycheck
I don't have to fake it
Don't have to wear make up
You say that I"m pretty
Pretty when I wake up

Why don't we make up our own rules
And break them when we like
Shake me off the branch a
And take the biggest bite

I don't have a t-shirt
Better than you fit me
In my lowest moments
You know how to lift me
Somehow it's that easy
Easy when you please me
Kiss off all my lipstick
I don't have to fix it

Why don't we make up our own rules
And break them when we like
Shake me off the branch and take the biggest bite
Make up our own rules
And break them when we like
Shake me off the branch and take the biggest bite

Can we make it up, can we make it up?
Can we make it up, can we make it up?

Why don't we make up our own rules
And break them when we like
Shake me off the branch and take the biggest bite
Make up our own rules
And break them when we like
Shake me off the branch and take the biggest bite
