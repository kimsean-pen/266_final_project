He looks as if he hasn't slept
His hair is purposely unkept
& then he knew his people wept
When you crafted your plan

The shadows underneath the eyes
& everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of proof is your disguise
You won't remember me

There's nothing really I can say
But "sorry mate" & walk away
I could be wrong unless you play
Your game
This world is cruel & most unkind
& horrible is redefined

I can't imagine that you'd mind at all
You're lying again
you're conscious ain't your friend
& the only thing you're sobbing out is your imagination
Lying again
You're conscious ain't your friend

& the only thing you're sobbing out is your imagination
Is he really on the street?
Desperation on deceit
& what he's wearing on his feet

Won't solve our mystery
& I am baffled by how you stand there
Soaking it in
& do you hide your identity
Where you hide your grin?

Better hide your grin
Shadows underneath the eyes
Everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of proof is your disguise

You won't remember me
There's nothing really I can say
But "sorry mate" & walk away
I could be wrong unless you play
Your game
This world is cruel & most unkind

& horrible is redefined
I can't imagine that you'd mind at all
You're lying again
Your conscious ain't your friend
& the only thing you're sobbing out is your imagination
Lying again
Your conscious ain't your friend
& the only thing you're sobbing out is your imagination
