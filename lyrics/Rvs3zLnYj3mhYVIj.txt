Hear the doldrum roll, the great Northeastern lines
Coupled carriage ticking like my metronome
I see the housing glow, skyline of cheap gold
and crooked teeth I will call home for a day or so

You can't carry me away now
Please don't steal me from my house
You can't carry me away now
I have just laid my head down
You can't carry me away now
Please don't steal me from my house
You can't carry me, don't steal me from my house

Inside the housing glow, I stiffen my tired shoes
With the starch of family food, Oh, I've missed you so

You can't carry me away now
Please don't steal me from my house
You can't carry me away now
I have just laid my head down
You can't carry me away now
Please don't steal me from my house
You can't carry me, don't steal me from my house
