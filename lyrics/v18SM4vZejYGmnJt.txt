We're not breaking any records yet
I stare at maps all day, a charade in the sunset

I read the news with all its angles bent
And blame my confusion on designs, so intelligent

Too many things
Too many things to keep my mind on

I was rehearsing for the in the out
A social seige to end the world

Arrows and bows
Aiming everywhere we go

This isn't farm life, oooh...

I was sleeping in dunes at night, the southernland
By day sail on the cannibal sea
I'm breathing in... this heavy water, oooh...

In my kingdom in my stratosphere
My girl hustles words to fools in particular
And from the safety of an overcoat
She wears a wire that runs all the way to Stockholm

Arrows and bows
Aiming everywhere we go

This isn't farm life, ooh...

An eye for an eye
Under the microscope
A mythic paradise
Another year, another try
On we go, on we go
