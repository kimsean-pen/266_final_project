Wondering outside Where do you go?
With your eyes in sight Who do you see?
You're in my life How do you feel?
But you don't know me Where could you be?
Where do you go?
Who do you see?
Mixing loyalty
I follow what I see
I follow what I feel
Until your wisdom loses me
Please
Stampede into me
Stampede into me
