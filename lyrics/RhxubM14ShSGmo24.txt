It's not over in my mind
Until you're out of sight
So let's pour a glass of red wine
Can we just rewind
The meaning of sublime

Don't go away
I'll never be the same
Don't go away
I'll make you want to stay

Don't tell me it's over now
Don't tell me it's over now
Don't you tell me it's over now

Can we put on the breaks
So we make no more mistakes
Can we freeze time for a while
Make you feel my enchant
While we share one last dance I'll make you want to stay

Don't go away
I'll never be the same
Don't go away
I'll make you want to stay

Maybe we're too far gone
Where did we go so wrong
I'll pour you a glass of red wine
Take another sip
Feel the sting of my sweet kiss
Our portrait lays in a bed of red roses

Don't tell me it's over now
Don't tell me it's over now
Don't you tell me it's over now
