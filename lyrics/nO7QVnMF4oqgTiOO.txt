Maybe I'm bound to wander
From one place to the next
Heaven knows why
But in the wild blue yonder
Your star is fixed in my sky

Just another bar at a crossroads
So far from home
But that's alright
Whenever I'm going down a dark road
I don't feel alone in the night

There's a place in my heart
Though we're far apart
May you always know
No matter how long since I saw you
I'll keep a flame there for you
Wherever I go

They're looking to close up in here
They're pulling down the blinds
But they'll let you stay awhile
They're not going to mind

Now I've got to leave you, brother
So this round's mine
Here's looking at you, anyhow
You can go on and have another
They won't call time
I'm going to say my goodbyes now

There's a place in my heart
Though we're far apart
May you always know
No matter how long since I saw you
I'll keep a flame there for you
Wherever I go
