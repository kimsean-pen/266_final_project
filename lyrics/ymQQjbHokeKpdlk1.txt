Five miles tall
And everything is small
Everything is small
Five miles down
You see your patch of ground
It's not so bad at all

Breathe in, out
And don't stop breathing

Cause this, this is your life
This is your world
And everything that you've been trusted with
It's small in your eyes
But great is your worth
And you can do this right
This is your life

Five miles high
Don't want to leave the sky
Everything's so clear
Five miles on
When clarity is gone
Just make it reappear
