You were fallin' from the sky
Every moment passed me by
And I know it won't get easier
I was up at 6 a.m.
You were running through my head
Don't want this tomorrow
But every second feels like a lifetime

I'm never the first to know
She's so impossible
I can't get out of my head into her bed
Tomorrow
She don't know what I'm feeling
Tonight I lost all control
Impossible

I was stuck inside my room
I was slippin' into you
And it was so much easier
But if I was just like you
I'd be on my way so soon
And I would feel so senseless
But every second feel like a lifetime

I'm never the first to know
She's so impossible
I can't get out of my head into her bed
Tomorrow
She don't know what I'm feeling
Tonight I lost all control
Impossible

She won't stop running away
Far from me
I'm crashing down
Too late
You were fallin' from the sky
Every moment passed me by

I'm never the first to know
She's so impossible
I can't get out of my head into her bed
Tomorrow
She don't know what I'm feeling
Tonight I lost all control
Impossible

First to know
She's so impossible
I can't get out of my head into her bed
Tomorrow
She don't know what I'm feeling
Tonight I lost all control
Impossible
