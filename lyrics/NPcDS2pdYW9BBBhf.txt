Ohh ohh ohhh ahhh
Ohh ohh ohhh ahhh

We're coming right back at ya, c'mon
This party's begun
Jump to it

It's a brand new day
I've got a feeling things are goin' my way
Cause the girls are back in town
So don't look down
Cause the groove won't let your feet touch the ground, yeah yeah

No lookin' back (harmony)
Did you thought we wouldn't make it this far
So we proved you wrong again (harmony)
Now's the time (time)
We're coming right back with a brand new design,
feelin' fine (harmony)

There's been tears along the way (ohhhh)
But we're still the best of friends (ohhhh)
Never needed to pretend (ohhhh)
Cause real friendship never ends

We're comin' right back at ya, c'mon
This party's begun
Jump to it cause the girls are comin' back again
Right back at ya, this time
We're changing the vibe
Get with it, cause the girls are comin' back again

Right, ohohohoh ohohohohoh 'cos the girls are coming back again

Now, have you taste of what we all can achieve
But we're comin' back for more (harmony)
to show you how (how)
To turn your dreams into our reality
Stronger than before (harmony)

There's been tears along the way (ohhh)
But we never cried alone (ohhh)
The four of us have grown (ohhh)
And our friendship never ends

Right -ohhh- 'cos the girls are coming back again

We're comin' right back at ya, c'mon
This party's begun
Jump to it cause the girls are comin' back again
Right back at ya, this time
We're changing the vibe
Get with it, cause the girls are comin' back again

We're coming irght back at ya, no R-I-P
Not forgetting the days when we were all Wannabes
Spice it up through and through, through and through to the limit
They all try and dis us but there ain't nothing in it
we started a trend that they all imitated
A new generation of spice we created
You all know who you are we couldn't have done it without ya
So once again we're coming right back at ya

There's been tears along the way (ohhhh)
But we're still the best of friends (ohhhh)
Never needed to pretend (ohhhh)
Cause real friendship never ends

We're comin' right back at ya, c'mon
This party's begun
Jump to it cause the girls are comin' back again
Right back at ya, this time
We're changing the vibe
Get with it, cause the girls are comin' back again

//: Right back at ya, c'mon
This party's begun
Jump to it cause the girls are comin' back again
Right back at ya, this time
We're changing the vibe
Get with it cause the girls are comin' back again:
