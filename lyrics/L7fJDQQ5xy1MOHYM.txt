Set fire, set fire to home
Burn in your chair
Let fall, let fall your Rome
Limit your cares
Watch another chance to make things right
Crumble and fall by the wayside
Another chance to set things straight
Wither and die as another day breaks from the light
You've rewired, rewired your code
Spirit betrayed
Now you drown just to stay afloat
Ripples degrade
Watch another chance to make things right
Crumble and fall by the wayside
Another chance to set things straight
Wither and die as another day breaks from the light
How do you see yourself on your one way ride?
How do you breathe in half light?
So wrapped up in your self-administered prize
Watch another chance to make things right
Crumble and fall by the wayside
Another chance to set things straight
You'll sink but you'll rise
It's alright, reach for the knife
Set fire, set fire to home
