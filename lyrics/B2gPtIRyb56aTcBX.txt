Here they come with their make up on
As lovely as the clouds come and see them
Boys and girls and their mums and their words
And their romances and jobs and their sons

Barking mad kids lonely dads
Who drug it up to give it some meaning
From the raves to the council estates
They're reminding us there's things to be done.

But you and me all we want to be is lazy
You and me so lazy
Here they come gone 7 am
Getting satellite and Sky getting cable,

Bills and Bens and their mums and their friends
Who just really, really want to be loved,
Uncle Teds and their legendary vests
Helping out around the disabled,

From the flats and the maisonettes
They're reminding us there's things to be done.
But you and me, all we want to be is lazy,
You and me, so lazy

It's you and me,
it's you and me, you and me
