Soft early, get Gimmie what Gimmie was asking for
Couple months later, Gimmie start asking for more
Gimmie said he going through it, life hard, he be starting to lose it
But every time I give him cash, he dry broke, he a doofus
So I say no and Gimmie took it how he took it
I said no for a reason, but he ain't asked, he said said "Fuck me"
And guess what I found out? Nigga what you find out?
Gimmie and my ex bitch was fucking, oh, ah, it touch me
Do i press him? Do I pop him? I need advice Father
Uhh...I thought you ain't love me no more nigga
I didn't know what to do, I had to fuck one of your bitches
See Gimmie all along was a cold nigga
Didn't give him what he wanted so Gimmie stole from niggas
And that's when I pulled out my Glock
Now everybody know how Gimmie got shot
