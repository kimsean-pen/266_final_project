"The mind is universe and can make a
heaven of hell a hell of heaven", John Milton

Beyond the burning fire, heaven and hell
Today I give you choices: life or death
I offer you desire, I sentence you to death
Today I give you a choice, I give you Hell

Heaven or hell, heaven or hell or fire, heaven or hell
Life or death

Sentenced to burn in fire, burning to death
Beyond the blazing fire, heaven and hell

Heaven or hell, heaven or hell or fire, heaven or hell
Life or death

Heaven and hell and fire
Heaven or hell

Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom
I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise

Heaven or hell, heaven or hell or fire, heaven or hell
Life or death

Heaven (Heaven!) and hell (and hell!)
Fire (fire!) and death (and death!)
Heaven (heaven!) and hell (and hell!)
Sentenced (sentenced!) to Death (to Death!)

"I do not believe in the creed professed by the Church,
by any Church that I know.
My own mind is my own Church", Thomas Paine
