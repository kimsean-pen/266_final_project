You saw me standing by the wall
Corner of a main street
And the lights are flashing
on your window sill
Take your chance (like all dreamers can't find another way)
You don't have to dream it all, just live a day.
Don't save a prayer for me now. Save it til the morning after
No don't save a prayer for me now. Save it til the morning after

Save it til the morning after
Save it til the morning after
Pretty looking road I try to hold the rising floods that fill my skin
Don't ask me why I'll keep my promise I'll melt the ice

And you wanted to dance so I asked you to dance
But fear is in your soul
Some people call it a one night stand but we can call it paradise
Don't save a prayer for me now. Save it til the morning after
No don't save a prayer for me now. Save it til the morning after
Save it til the morning after

Save it til the morning after
Save a prayer til the morning after
Save a prayer til the morning after
Save a prayer til the morning after
Save a prayer til the morning after
