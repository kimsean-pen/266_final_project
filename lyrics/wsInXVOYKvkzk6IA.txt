A room full of people, too anxious to mingle
My brain yells at me, "It's the perfect time
To get existential, your body's a rental"
Push back, tell myself that I'm just fine
More people show up, I think I might throw up
Go out for some fresh air to clear out my mind
There's more people out there, this shit is a nightmare
I wanna go home, but I'll piss off my ride
(So I'll just keep drinking)
And hope for the best
Let my brain do the rest
Man, fuck it, whatever, I guess

Sometimes I think I've wasted my whole life
Chasing my pipe dreams
With shots and a whole lot of beer
A part of me figures there's no fight
Left in the shell of a person I became this year

Fuck, is that the first place I go?
Why can't I, for one night, let this roll off my shoulders?
Damn, this is bleak
I know I'm not this weak
I thought people got wiser when older?

Then again, I think I've wasted my whole life
Chasing my pipe dreams with shots and a whole lot of beer
A part of me figures there's no fight left
In the shell of a person I became this year
I wonder if my parents know why
I'm a recluse and I don't leave my house on most days
When my friends ask if am all right,
I lie straight to their faces and say I'm okay

I just want to be a normal person
Or anything but me

Stuck In a room full of people, too anxious to mingle
My brain yelling that it's the perfect time
To get existential, your body's a rental
And something is wrong I think you might be dying!
(Oh no)
(I just want to be a normal person)
(Or anything but me)

(I just want to be a normal person)
To think that I've wasted my whole life
Chasing my pipe dreams with shots and a whole lot of beer
(Or anything but me)
A part of me knows that there's no fight left
In the shell of a person I became this year
(I just want to be a normal person)
To think that I've wasted my whole life
Chasing my pipe dreams with shots and a whole lot of beer
(Or anything but me)
A part of me knows that there's no fight left
In the shell of a person I became this year
(I just want to be a normal person)
To think that I've wasted my whole life
Chasing my pipe dreams with shots and a whole lot of beer
(Or anything but me)
A part of me knows that there's no fight left
In the shell of a person I became this year

I think that I've wasted my whole life
