No less than slave
It's stuffy in here
Quite less than fate
I need some fair air

Set heaven in panic, no matter what he says
Hidden like a doubt, no sign can be seen
Lost and found dead, my radar's still on tracking

A shady's kid mislead and plainly killed shut up
His genotype's lost in the rain, his lonely blood fell out

How far it's been carried on?
Last switch here on my side
So far it's been moving on
No one ever let me see

Nothing same
It's sticky out there
No less than tame
I call up the fair fear
So I say "outcast"
Seal off a casket
I don't miscast
I pick up the last one

Now what the hell shut up, what the hell kick out
Lonely blood's lost in the box, it suddenly wakes up

How long it's been carried on?
Next key's here in the guage
So far it's still moving on
My nerve's been set on edge
With a lie scale, full of blockage
I need the next grade

Set hell in peace, no matter what he says
It's just like a heaven now, no prayer wanna get out
Then lost and found is closed down, but I'm still checking the sign out
Gimme a break! Won't you just let me off now?

Lonely blood fell out, it calls me so loud
My genotype's lost in the sky, fly away, fly away!

How far it's been carried on?
Last switch's dead in your hand
How come no one tell me why?
My nerve's been set on edge

How far it's been carried on?
Last switch's dead in your hand
How come no one tell me why?
My nerve's been set on edge
With a lie scale, full of blockage
I'm about to leave
