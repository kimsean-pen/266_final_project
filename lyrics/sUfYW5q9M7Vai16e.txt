Always teaching me how to be
When your folks are not here to see
You're crashing on the floor with me
But I can't sleep
And I don't wanna know
You've found another place to go
I copy everything practical
And for the last time I am sure

Ooh, you are not alone
Ooh, for the last time I am sure
(Repeat)
I know what to feel when you decide, oh why

Where is the appeal when you don't try, try?
It's your only way to live
Three doors down and one room in
I loose my mind amongst your things

But I can't swim
It's the same it's just like then
When I was nine and you were ten
Wishing we could still be friends
Where we move is where we end
Ooh, you are not alone
Ooh, for the last time I am sure
(Repeat)

I know what to feel when you decide, oh why
Where is the appeal when you don't try, try?
But I can't swim
But I can't swim
But I can't swim
I know what to feel when you decide, oh why
Where is the appeal when you don't try, try?
(Repeat)
