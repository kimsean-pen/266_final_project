Forced smiles in picture frames
Memories of better days
All these white walls that look so dark at night
Scared kids sit on the couch
Mom and dad take final bows
And their hearts break as the chapter reads its end, its end

Looking for an answer, the house lights rise
Wishing for an ending that's not goodbye
We watch the curtains close on all we've known
We watch the curtains close on all we've known

Yesteryears in coats of blue
Broken vows once spoken true knowing
Being torn in two never comes out clean, out clean

Looking for an answer, the house lights rise
Wishing for an ending that's not goodbye
We watch the curtains close on all we've known
We watch the curtains close on all we've known

Every fly till die must see the days
Beyond the broken hearts
With the futures [?] to heal
To learn to live, be better off apart

Looking for an answer, the house lights rise
Wishing for an ending that's not goodbye
We watch the curtains close on all we've known
We watch the curtains close on all we've known
It doesn't always matter how hard we try
Sometimes the only ending is just goodnight
We watch the curtains close on all we've known
(Learn to live and be better off)
We watch the curtains close on all we've known
(Learn to live and be better off)
