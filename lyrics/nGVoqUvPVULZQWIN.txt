Legions mass upon this place
For another night of violent abuse
Maniacs in leather and black
Ready and willing for the attack
Metal mayhem running free
Now all around is breaking loose
Fists are flying pluses race
The circle will destroy this place

Feel adrenaline rush
Jump into the pit
Kicking as you push
Braced for the hit
Bow down to the thrasher

Blood on the stage, a thousand rage
A thrasher's soul on fire
Chaos spreads across the floor
Bands your head, make it sore
Metal madness engulfs the stage
In the pit you come of age
Let battle commence, no space for the weak
The thrasher's dreams are no complete

Feel adrenaline rush
Jump into the pit
Kicking as you push
Braced for the hit
Bow down to the thrasher
