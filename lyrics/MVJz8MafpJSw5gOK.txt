Why do we always feel like we need to try?
Why do we believe that we need to be somebody else
To feel alive?
Why do we make
Why do we keep making the same mistakes?
And believing that it won't make a difference if we try
To break away

I know, I know what you must be thinking
That we are powerless to change things
But don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love
I won't throw my hands up to surrender
'Cause love is stronger than fire
So don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love

Time
Don't you think it's just a waste of time
When we're always fighting over material trivial things
In this life
Yeah

I don't understand why we don't get it right
Why do we keep going round and round
At the end of the day, we've only got ourselves to blame, now

I know, I know what you must be thinking
That we are powerless to change things
But don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love, yeah
I won't throw my hands up to surrender
'Cause love is stronger than fire
So don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love

(We got love)
(We got love) We got love, we got love
(We got love) We got love

I know, I know what you must be thinking
That we are powerless to change things
But don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love
I won't throw my hands up to surrender
'Cause love is stronger than fire
So don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love, 'cause we got love

We got love, hm hm
