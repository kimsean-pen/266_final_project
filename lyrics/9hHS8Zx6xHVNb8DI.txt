Yours is the only version of my desertion
That I could ever subscribe to
That is all that I can do
You are a past dinner, the last winner
I'm raping all around me
Until the last drop is behind you

You're so cute when you're frustrated, dear
Yeah, you're so cute when you're sedated, dear
Oh yes, dear

Sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tonight, sleep tonight
Sleep tonight, sleep tonight

You are the only person who's completely certain
There's nothing here to be into
That is all that you can do
You are a past sinner, the last winner
And everything we've come to
That makes you, you

But you cannot safely say
That while I will be away
That you will not consider sadly
How you helped me to stray
And you will not reach me I am
Resenting a position that's past resentment
And now I can't consider
And now there is this distance, so

Sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tonight, sleep tonight
Sleep tonight, sleep tonight

Something to say
Something to do
Nothing to say
When there's nothing to do
