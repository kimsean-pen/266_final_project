I have chased this flame
And been burned a thousand times
(Left with smoke in my lungs)
And I can't change my ways
No matter how I try
I'm not enough

Between my heart and my head
There lies a great divide
In which my future's dead
But now my past won't die

My higher power said
Love is where you left it
Back in the home
Where I should've left my wrists slit
I'm always left behind
Bipolar state of mind
I bloom into the high
Til all these memories collide
Dead to rights I've got the ache in spades
I showed you all of my colors
In every single fucking shade yeah

And I have chased this flame
And been burned a thousand times
(Left with smoke in my lungs)
And I can't change my ways
No matter how I try
No I'm not enough

I was a sensational fiend
Living a breakable dream
I was talking to God
And testing my faith
I stoke the flame
To try and find some grace
My higher power said
Love is where you left it
Back in the home
Where I should've left my wrists slit
I'm always left behind
Bipolar state of mind
I bloom into the high
Til all these memories collide

And I have chased this flame
And been burned a thousand times
(Left with smoke in my lungs)
And I can't change my ways
No matter how I try
No I'm not enough
So forget me when I'm gone
Cuz all that ever mattered
Were these fucking songs
I dance the thin line
Between chaos and kindness
What scum I was
Hateful and mindless

I have chased this flame
And been burned a thousand times
(Left with smoke in my lungs)
And I can't change my ways
No matter how I tried
(No matter how I tried)
And if there's anything that I have learned
(I'm not enough)
I am the one
Who loves to be burned
(I'm not enough)
I fetishsize
Self sabotage
(Not enough)
Shut your eyes
Wait for applause

And I have chased this flame
And been burned a thousand times
(Left with smoke in my lungs)
And I can't change my ways
No matter how I try
No I'm not enough
