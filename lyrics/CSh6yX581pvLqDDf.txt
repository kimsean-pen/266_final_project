A long time ago, I never knew myself
Then the memory of shame birthed it's gift
No more the small one, the weak one, the frightened one
Running from beatings, deflating
I'm becoming more than a man
More than you ever were
Driven and burning
To rise beyond Jesus

I'm born again
With snakes eyes
Becoming
God size

I found my life was slipping through my hands
Perhaps through death my life won't be so bad
I can see you
Can fuck you, inside of you
Staring through your eyes
Belittle your friends to serve me
To suck me
To realize my saving grip
I, of suicide
I, the Unlord

I'm born again
With snakes eyes
Becoming
God size

I'm born again
With snakes eyes
Becoming
God size
