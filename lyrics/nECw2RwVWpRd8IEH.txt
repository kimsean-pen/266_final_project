It's a crazy world we live in
And I'm leaving it today
For another institution
We crazy people play
Every time I climbed a mountain
And it turned into a hill
I promised me that I'd move on
And I will

I, I, good for nothing
Going nowhere, so they say, hey

Someone give me blessings
For they say that I have sinned
That's when I crawl inside myself
And ride into the wind
On strange highways
On strange highways

Hey, you, I want your number
Don't even wonder, we do things our way here
Questions, these are forbidden
We got no answers, believe us anyway

So here is my confession
It's the only broken rule
Sometimes I crawl inside of me
Where I can be the fool
On strange highways
On strange highways

You can see the other side
And you shall come over
You can't be the other side
If you say I will

Every time I climbed a mountain
And it turned into a hill
Well, I promised me I'd disappear
And now I know I will

So someone give me blessings
For the times you say I've sinned
So I can crawl inside myself
And ride into the wind
On strange highways
On strange highways

Questions, they're forbidden
Hey, you, what's your number
Oh, we've got no answers
Don't you even wonder

On strange highways
