I see you in a different light
I see you in a different light

I wanna make a movie
I wanna put you on the silver screen
Sit in a darkened room and look at you from a distance

Wanna write a novel
Freeze all your expressions into words
I come back later and read about what I should have heard

I see you in a different light
I see you in a different light, different light

I want to paint your portrait
And hang your colors on my wall
Discussing form and content with my friends and drinks
And no one thinks at all

I see you in a different light
I see you in a different light

I see you in a different light
I see you in a different light, different light
