You've done me wrong
Your time is up
You took a sip
(Just a sip)
From the devil's cup
You broke my heart
There's no way back
Move right outta here baby

Go and pack your bags
Just who do you think you are?
Stop acting like some kind of star
Just who do you think you are?

Take it like a man baby, if that's what you are?
'Cause I'm moving on up, you're moving on out
Movin' on up, nothing can stop me
Moving on up, you're moving on out
Time to break free, nothing can stop me
Yea
They brag a man has walked in space
But you can't even find my place

There ain't nothing
(Not a thing)
You can do, 'cause I've had enough of me
Baby being part of you
Just who do you think you are?
This time you've gone too far

Just who do you think you are?
Take it like a man baby, if that's what you are?
'Cause I'm moving on up, you're moving on out
Movin' on up, nothing can stop me

Moving on up, you're moving on out
Time to break free, nothing can stop me
I'm moving on up, you're moving on out
Movin' on up, nothing can stop me
Moving on up, you're moving on out
Time to break free, nothing can stop me
Yea
Movin' on up

Movin' on up
Movin' on up
Movin' on up
Moving on up, you're moving on out
Movin' on up, nothing can stop me
Moving on up, you're moving on out
Time to break free, nothing can stop me
Movin', movin', movin', nothing can stop me
Movin', movin', time to break free
Nothing can stop me
