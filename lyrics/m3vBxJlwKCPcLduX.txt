I have loved and I have lost
Broken rivers I have crossed
I have made it through the flames
Like a diamond, I've been shaped
A thousand times again

Now I can love deeper
I wanna love harder
So love like you've never been hurt
'Cause love can change the world
Now let's go higher
Together we're stronger
So love like you've never been hurt
'Cause love can change the world

I've seen the first become the last
Heroes rising out of ash new
And after everywhere I've been
I know the journey is the wind
And I wouldn't change a thing

Now I wanna love deeper (deeper)
I wanna love harder (harder)
So love like you've never been hurt
'Cause love can change the world
Now let's go higher (higher)
Together we stronger (stronger)
So love like you've never been hurt
'Cause love can change the world

'Cause when we go deep
That's when it gets real
That's when you feel real love
I wanna feel real love
I want a woman you see
To be the person I am
I wanna feel real love
I wanna feel real love

Now I can love deeper (deeper)
I wanna love harder (harder)
So love like you've never been hurt (like you've never been hurt)
'Cause love can change the world
Now let's go higher (higher)
Together we stronger (stronger)
So love like you've never been hurt
'Cause love can change the world

Say you're with me yes
Love can change the world
We can change the world

I have loved and I have lost
Broken rivers I have crossed
I have made it through the flames
Like a diamond, I've been shaped
I would do it all again
