Poverty is nothing for you
It is nothing for me
When I'm by your side

Silver and gold worth nothing for us
When I'm by your side
The only treasure is here, it's us, in our love

Tell me, what is it for you
To be a part of a secret company
With a little man like me

Authority and power are nothing for us
When I'm by your side
The only treasure is here, it's in us, our love
When I'm by your side
By your side
