Some days I couldn't get up
I couldn't get down
I'm bored of everything
Somehow a little black cloud rained over me
Someone was making me mad
Good turned bad and I lose everything
To get you back
Just to get you back

But
These days the world's alright
The sun shines bright
I'm kicking off the bad dreams
These days I don't think twice
Walk on light
I'm positively somewhere

(Chorus)
These days go on long after you've gone
These days go on long after you've gone
These days go on and on and on and on and on

Out of the fire into the swimming pool
Sometimes I drown my tears
Same old fears came back
Someone was making me ill
I bet you're still
A two, three, four litter word
Guess you heard
Pretty little birds fly home

But
These days the sun kicks in
The good guys win
I'm legal in the back seat
These days I'm safe and sound
Not dragged down
You wanna know the reason

(Chorus)
These days go on long after you've gone
These days go on long after you've gone
These days go on and on and on and on and on

Thank you for not being here
I feel better when you're not sleeping in my head
Tossin' and turnin' an' messin' up the sheets
The love we made was incomplete
Like the shoes on your feet
The same stuff I've heard it before
That philosophy's starting to bore me
Now you won't have to smile and ignore me

These days the karma's right
The sun shines bright
I'm kicking out the bad dreams
These days I don't think twice
Walk on light
I'm positively somewhere

(Chorus)
These days go on (and on and on and on and on)
These days go on (and on and on and on and on)
These days go on (and on and on and on and on)
