Normandy
I haven't been here before
I haven't been here before
I haven't been here
Where everything sinks in your beautiful thoughts
Where my pleasure is light of a firework
I stand still on the edge, can't remember that feeling
I can't remember that place
Rain and fog
I travelled by train too long
I travelled by train for so long
I travelled by train alone
Unfamiliar sound of a mystery place
I was lying alone with the hands on my face
I was lying alone with a miserable feeling of felicity
