Loud echoes from the end
Nothing but a flat lie
All I need is a new world
Create my universe

The four basic forces
Are ready and fixed
All set to prove myself
It really exists

Risk it, try it, find it!
If my body cannot stand
Don't wanna be born again
I have enough of my land

Putting myself in this project
Within a space that's still secret
Am I to blame for future fate?
A ball of energy

Vortex around me
I have to realize
My theory is wise
The four basic forces

Are ready and fixed
All set to prove myself
It really exists
Risk it, try it, find it!

I think I've found the way
I wanna move not stay
Time is fast and so unsafe
Conquest is what I can expect

Without frontiers there's no respect
The less you give the more I take
Burst getting stronger
In atoms smasher

Powerful magnets
Interchanges the mass
Annihilation, a full reaction
The protons travel in a big circle

Meeting in this race
Their mirror-image
Dematerialized
Body lost its size

Tube without exit
No way out of it
Micro-galaxies
A lot more to see

Magnetic fusion
My self-creation
I'm in the machine

Going through my dreams
Dimension Hatröss
Dimension Hatröss.
