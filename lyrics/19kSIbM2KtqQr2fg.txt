It doesn't matter what you do, where you go, who you see
Without me
It's blackjack, don't look back, your luck is runnin' out of hand
You're dealin' over me
Jet set, upset, make a mess that never ends
You've had enough, you see

(It doesn't matter) The clothes you wear
(It doesn't matter) If they stare
(It doesn't matter) If it's stop or go
(It doesn't matter) I don't need to know

It doesn't matter if it's Russian Roulette, it's not me
For free
You're so hot, you never stop, livin' life until you drop
It's not up to me
Out all night until the day, live your life some other way
It's still not up to me

(It doesn't matter) The clothes you wear
(It doesn't matter) If they stare
(It doesn't matter) If it's stop or go
(It doesn't matter) I don't need to know

Turnin' out the lights
For long weekend nights
Give me a reason why you're here

Again it's blackjack, don't look back, your luck is runnin' out of hand
You're dealin' over me
Jet set, upset, make a mess that never ends
You've had enough, you see

(It doesn't matter) The clothes you wear
(It doesn't matter) If they stare
(It doesn't matter) If it's stop or go
(It doesn't matter) I don't need to know

Turnin' out the lights
For long weekend nights

It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter

Turnin' out the lights
For long weekend nights

(It doesn't matter)
(It doesn't matter) If they stare
(It doesn't matter) If it's stop or go
(It doesn't matter) I don't need to know
