If I could ease your mind
Calm the storm inside
Pull your drifting heart back from a cruel and bitter tide
Show you that tomorrow everything will be just fine
All in due time
All

Somewhere down the road
Your stars will show
Somewhere down the road
You're almost home
You're almost home

If you believe in nothing else
Just keep believing in yourself
There will be times of trouble, it's gonna hurt like hell
This much I know
All ends well
It all ends well

If I could heal the scars
Show you what you are
Bind the wounds of disbelief that brought you down so hard
I would be the tourniquet around your doubting heart
All in due time
All

Somewhere down the road
Your stars will show
Somewhere down the road
You're almost home
You're almost home

If you believe in nothing else
Just keep believing in yourself
There will be times of trouble, it's gonna hurt like hell
This much I know
All ends well
It all ends well

So hard to see, so hard to find (so hard to find)
All that you need will calm the tide (will calm the tide)
These words of wisdom, do not ignore
You have so much to give, won't you live
Won't you live a little more

If you believe in nothing else
Just keep believing in yourself
There will be times of trouble it's gonna hurt like hell
This much I know, all ends well
This much I know, all ends well
This much I know, all ends well
This much I know, all ends well
This much I know, all ends well
