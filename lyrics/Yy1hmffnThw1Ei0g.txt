Lili
Take another walk out of your fake world
Please put all the drugs out of your hand
You'll see that you can breath without no back up
So much stuff you got to understand

For every step in any walk
Any town of any thought
I'll be your guide

For every street of any scene
Any place you've never been
I'll be your guide

Lili
You know there's still a place for people like us
The same blood runs in every hand
You see it's not the wings that make the angel
Just have to move the bats out of your head

For every step in any walk
Any town of any thought
I'll be your guide

For every street of any scene
Any place you've never been
I'll be your guide

Lili
Easy as a kiss we'll find an answer
Put all your fears back in the shade
Don't become a ghost without no colour
'Cause you're the best paint life ever made

For every step in any walk
Any town of any thought
I'll be your guide

For every street of any scene
Any place you've never been
I'll be your guide
