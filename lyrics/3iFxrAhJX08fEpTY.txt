For so long I've obeyed
That feminine decree

I've always contained
Your desire to hurt me

But when will I turn
And cut the world?

When will I turn and cut the world?

My eyes are coral
Absorbing your dreams

My skin is a surface
To push to extremes

My heart is a record
Of dangerous scenes
But when will I turn
And cut the world?

When will I turn and cut the world?
When will I turn and cut the world?
When will I turn and cut the world?

When will I turn and cut the world?

When will I turn and cut the world?
