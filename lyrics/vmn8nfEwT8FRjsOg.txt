The drive to be someone you're not
Chased desert dreams in hopes I'm not forgotten

I told myself that I was doing the right thing
Faked everything, faked everything I'm not

Red clouds come down
Won't you take me away?
Red clouds all around
Won't you take me away?

I remember how badly I wanted to be here
Now I'm just scared

Unveiled destiny
Miles apart from me

I told myself that I was doing the right thing
Faked everything, faked everything I'm not

Red clouds come down
Won't you take me away?
Red clouds all around
Won't you take me away?
Cause sometimes it takes a little bit of leaving
To find to find some meaning
Red clouds come down
Won't you take me away
Won't you take me away

My intention to be better than you thought I could be
Ended up getting caught up in the life I never thought I ever would be
They say they "told me so"
But how could I have ever known

Well now I know better
I'll never be your prisoner
I hoped you knew me better
I am my own prisoner

Red clouds come down
Won't you take me away?
Red clouds all around
Won't you take me away?
Cause sometimes it takes a little bit of leaving
To find to find some meaning
Red clouds come down
Won't you take me away
Won't you take me away
