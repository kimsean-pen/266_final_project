Hello, I'd like for us to talk, but right now is not such a great time.
Maybe when it's more convenient for me and I get something out of it.
We'll start off slow, maybe rides to work, that's all I can take for now.
It's hard to please everyone, alright?
I promise.
I think I'm more happy when there's no sorries.
How's it feel to have such fools attracted to you?
I think I know well I know I thinkâ€• I sort of have nothing to say and if I did I'd say nothing at all.
Now I'm too scared to touch a friend like you.
