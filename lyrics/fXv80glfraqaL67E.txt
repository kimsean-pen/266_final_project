Everything's been said before
Nothin' left to say anymore
When it's all the same
You can ask for it by name

Babble, babble, bitch, bitch
Rebel, rebel, party, party
Sex, sex, sex and don't forget the violence
Blah, blah, blah
Got your lovey-dovey sad and lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in
Everybody sing along

Babble, babble, bitch, bitch
Rebel, rebel, party, party
Sex, sex, sex and don't forget the violence
Blah, blah, blah
Got your lovey-dovey sad and lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in
Everybody sing

Are you motherfuckers ready for the new shit?
Stand up and admit that tomorrow's never coming
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit

Do we get it? No!
Do we want it? Yeah!
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit

Babble, babble, bitch, bitch

Stick your stupid slogan in
