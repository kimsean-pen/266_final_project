Sitting at a bus stop
Trying to take my shoes off
But my laces are all knots and you
Looking for an answer to an old question
So easy I can't explain it
And anything I say to you is gonna
Come out wrong anyway

Made it to the trolley
Looking for my transfer
Cause the place is full of cops and you...
Looking for an answer to an old question
So easy I can't explain it
And anything I say to you is gonna
Come out wrong anyway

You take my seat again...

Late at the station
Feeling all wound up
Got to walk several blocks past you.
Try to read a t-shirt
Thinks that I'm a pervert.
Sorry, wasn't getting fresh, but...
And anything I say to you is gonna
Come out wrong anyway

It's there in front of me...

Here to my house
In no seconds
Count the footsteps
Count the seconds
Near my house...
