Burn me alive if you feel that's justified.
Burn me alive if you feel that's justified.

Burn me alive if you feel that's justified.
I need more than faith to see you on the other side, the other side.

Can you hear me, the lowly one?
Do ya fear me, you righteous ones?

Bow down to all Earth's creation.
Every man of every nation.
Who's right and wrong at times like these?

Burn me alive if you feel that's justified.
I need more than faith to see you on the other side, the other side.

Can you hear me, the lowly one?
Do ya fear me, you righteous ones?

I believe in a life before death,
that happiness and virtue coexist.
And if you only believe to hedge the bet,
you're gonna pay your debt!

Burn me alive if you feel that's justified.
I need more than faith to see you on the other side, the other side.

The lowly ones need more than this to see you on the other side, the other side.

Burn me alive.
Feel nothing, leave nothing.
Learn nothing then be on your way,
be on your way.
Do ya fear me, you righteous ones?
Can you hear me, the lowly one?
The lowly ones.
