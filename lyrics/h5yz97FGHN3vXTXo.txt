Telephone meltdown, check my likes
Stare deep in the black mirror
Is this real life?
Cast out for an answer
Serve bait 'til you bite
My mind like a magnet, online

Distraction
Distractions own my eyes
Distraction
Distractions own my eyes

So deep in a mindset
So down for a fight
So brave on the laptop
So bored with life
Speak truth to the
Church choir, go take sides
My mind like a magnet, online

Distraction
Distractions own my eyes
Distraction
Distractions own my eyes
Distraction
Distractions own my eyes
Distraction
Distractions own my eyes
