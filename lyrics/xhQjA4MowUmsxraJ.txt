We're both on the shore
You're killing me
you're holding me down
You call me for sure
You're killing me
you're holding me down

Little talks for the better
Top top on your shoulder
I felt love but it's over
I grow down, down, down
Black sharps going under
My skin getting older
felt love but it's over
I grow down,

And you are just
fading away
It's getting cold, I'm felling colder
And you are just
finding away

Little talks for the better
Top top on your shoulder
I felt love but it's over
I grow down, down, down
Black sharps going under
My skin getting older
I felt love but it's over
I grow down, down, down

We're both on the road
You're breaking me
you're holding me down
We shared all our hearts
You're breaking me
you're holding me down

Red lips for the hotter
none has swing better
I felt love but it's over
I grow down, down, down

fake blood and a finger
together and wilder
felt love but it's over
I grow down,

And you are just
fading away
It's getting cold, I'm felling colder
And you are just
finding away

Red lips for the hotter
none has swing better
I felt love but it's over
I grow down, down, down

fake blood and a finger
together and wilder
felt love but it's over
I grow down, down, down

Little talks for the better
Top top on your shoulder
I felt love but it's over
I grow down, down, down
Black sharps going under
My skin getting older
I felt love but it's over
I grow down, down, down x2
