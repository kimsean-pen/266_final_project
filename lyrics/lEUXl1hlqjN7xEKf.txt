How many shrimps do you have to eat?
before you make your skin turn pink
eat too much and you'll get sick
shrimps are pretty rich

Nande aitsura wa pinku?
Doubutsu-en de omou to pinku
Tabemono de, sou nanda
Jitsu wa watashi wa tarako ga daisuki
Purasu ebi kani tabeyo
Pinku iro ni naru no
Dakara minna chigau iro
Ningen-de kanchigai
Shiteru yo ne

Black, white, green or blue
show off your natural hue
flamingo, oh oh owoah
if you're multicouloured that's cool too
You, dont, need to change
it's boring being the same
flamingo, oh oh oh
You're pretty either way
