At ten in the morning
I was laughing at something
At the airport terminal
At nine in the evening
I was sitting crying to you over the phone
Well passing the border from a state to another
Filled with people whom I couldn't help to relate to
And we stopped a while at a roadside restaurant
Where the waitress was sitting outside smoking in her car
She had that look of, fear in her eyes
And as we drove away from there she looked at me and
she smiled

I keep running around
Trying to find the ground
But my head is in the stars
My feet are in the sky
Well I'm nobody's baby
I'm everybody's girl
I'm the queen of nothing
I'm the king of the world

Well once you asked me well what's my biggest fear
That things would always remain so unclear
That one day I'd wake up all alone
With a big family and emptiness sleeping in my bones
That I would be so blinded, turn into fear
And that my fake laugh would suddenly sound sincere

Now I wasn't born for anything
Wasn't born to say anything
I'm just here now and soon I'll be gone
I'm nobody's baby
I'm everybody's girl
I'm the queen of nothing
I'm the king of the world

Now everyday there's a
While I sleep they start dimming the lights
Well I've seen everything I ever want to see
Screaming fire in the theater, people taking their seats
Watch it all go down like the stone in the stream
Fall for your reflection, drown in the tree

Tell me something real
Tell me something true
I just want to feel there's something left that I can do
But I'm nobody's baby
I'm everybody's girl
I'm the queen of nothing
I'm the king of the world
