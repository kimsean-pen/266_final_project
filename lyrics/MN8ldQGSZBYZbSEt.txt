I never took away your crutch, just became it day by day
blood filling up our boots
what's the use in talking
all you wanna do is walk
its all you wanna do
This is how the summer ends
This is how the summer ends.

You never took away my crutch just became it day by day
blood filling up our boots
whats the use in talking
eyes are open finally
eyes are open finally
and all you wanna do is walk
its all you wanna do do
and this is how the summer ends
This is how the summer ends

I, I had the same choices as you do, as you do.
and you fall
fall like i knew you would
leave me down down down
leave me down

I never showed you what i want
you never told me what you need
a match bursting into flames
and all is dust soon enough

Eyes are open finally
eyes are open finally
and all you wanna do is walk
its all you wanna do, do
and this is how the summer ends
This is how the summer ends.

I, I have the same choices as you do
as you do
and you fall
fall like i knew you would
leave me down down down
leave me down

He's on your doorstep
He's laden with flowers
This garden is freezing teasing, you leaving me for hours
