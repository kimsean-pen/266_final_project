Burn, burn house on fire
I'm so sick and tired
I can still remember your sound
It is cut, cut, cutting me down

I'm locked and loaded
You're so milk and roses
And I am just a lapdog, I'm your hound
It is cut, cut, cutting me down

Like a slow poison
Cut me down like a slow poison

Sing me one more hymnal
I have found my angel
Oh, oh, oh, she walks upon the ground
It is cut, cut, cutting me down

I'm an empty can
I'm a stranger in a strange, strange land
Gone, gone, just gone without a sound
It is cut, cut cutting me down

Like slow poison
Cutting down like slow poison

And all my dreams are only dreams
And all my schemes are only schemes
And if this is my punishment
Then I want my crime to fit

Burn, burn house on fire
I'm so sick and tired
I can still remember your sound
It is cut, cut cutting me down

Like slow poison
Cut down like slow poison
It's cutting me
Like slow poison

Sing me one more hymnal
I have found my angel
Oh, oh, oh, she walks upon the ground
It is cut, cut, cutting me down
