Wake up my love
Never thought you'd make me, break me
Now I'm up from below
Such a brilliant star you are

And will your love keep burning baby
Burn a hole right through my eyes
All these short times feel like no time
I thought you ought to know

I'm so far gone now I been running on empty
I'm so far gone now do you wanna take me on?

Do, do you, do you know?
Do you know how long I've waited? to look up from below
Just to find someone like you?
And will your love light burn me baby?

Burn a hole right through my heart
I think I might just trust you, maybe
But I'm not sure
I'm not sure I wanna know

I'm so far gone now I been running on empty
I'm so far gone now do you wanna take me high?
I'm so far gone now I been running on empty
I'm so far gone now do you wanna take me on?

I think you could make me girl
Could make me and take my life
I know you could break me girl
Take all of me all of me, yeah

Wake up my love
Never thought you'd make me, break me
Now I'm up from below
Such a brilliant star you are

I'm so far gone now I been running on empty
I'm so far gone now do you wanna take me high?
I'm so far gone now I been running on empty
I'm so far gone now do you wanna take me on?
Do you wanna take me on?
