It's 3 A.M.
I hope you're home
I wanna be with you
Just let me in
Through the window
I had a dream
We fell asleep
We woke up in ecstasy
What makes a dream come true
No one needs to know
I will come in through the window
Oh
I'm not leaving you
Alone
You could write this love in
Stone
I'm not leaving you
Alone

It's Friday night and we're alive
And lover's Lane is open wide
We'll get there
When we arrive (we arrive)
Your balcony's a limousine
Your bed's a yellow submarine
Ride off to the great unknown
Just let me in through the window
No one needs to know
I will come in through the window
Oh
I'm not leaving you
Alone
You could write this love in
Stone
I'm not leaving you
Alone

Oh
I'm not leaving you
Alone
You could write this love in
Stone
I'm not leaving you
Alone
No
I'm not leaving you
Alone
You could write this love in
Stone
I'm not leaving you
Alone

Oh
I'm not leaving you
Alone
You could write this love in
Stone
I'm not leaving you
Alone
Oh
I'm not leaving you
Alone
You could write this love in
Stone
I'm not leaving you
Alone
