I'm the life of the party
I read between the lines and overthink
What's the difference when I drink?
So open up another
I'm a prisoner to this mood
There's an explanation and it's good
I can change my attitude
So open up another
Party with me
Party with me
Party with me cause I need something from you
You're making me cool
Party with me
Party with me
Party with me 'til I see nothing but you
You're making me cool
It's hard to be myself
It's hard to be, hard to be
Hard to be, hard to be
It's hard to be myself
It's hard to be, hard to be
So just tonight
What the fuck, yeah
Do you cure the nervousness?
Cause every word you say, I'm thinking less
It's a trick to second guess me
Like you would a lover
I'm a constant state of war
Why am I afraid of being sure
So fill me up, I'm insecure
Open up another
Party with me
Party with me
Party with me cause I need something from you
You're making me cool
Party with me
Party with me
Party with me 'til I see nothing but you
You're making me cool, yeah
It's hard to be myself
It's hard to be, hard to be
Hard to be, hard to be
It's hard to be myself
It's hard to be, hard to be
So just tonight
What the fuck
Party with me
Party with me
Party with me cause I need something from you
You're making me cool
Party with me
Party with me
Party with me 'til I see nothing but you
You're making me cool, yeah
It's hard to be myself
It's hard to be, hard to be
It's hard to be myself
It's hard to be, hard to be
So just tonight
What the fuck, yeah
I could be, I could be
I could be, I could be
I could be cooler
It's hard to be, hard to be
Hard to be, hard to be
It's hard to be myself
Yeah
