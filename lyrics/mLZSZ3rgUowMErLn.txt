We can talk by the river
We can walk, right out to the sea
I havent talked much lately
Maybe that's why you never talk to me

so, you're at a low
your speeding heart, is getting slow
the music fades, before your mind
you hold the hand, and whisper man

man, it feels like space
you saw her face man, she cries
the river sticks is getting wide
the brokelyn waste, the rollen ways
and jesus says
they both say

We can talk by the river
We can walk, right out to the sea
I havent talked much lately
Maybe that's why you never talk to me

We can talk by the river
We can walk, right out to the sea
I havent talked much lately
Maybe that's why you never talk to me

it took you all the time to know
it took him all the time to know
it took you all the time to know
it took him all the time to know
it took you all the time to know
