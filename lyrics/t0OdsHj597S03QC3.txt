It's been a long time coming, coming, coming
Feeling your presence hovering, hovering, hovering
Time that I finally say something, something, something
You're not gonna take this one lying down

But the cold hard truth is I can make it without you
And the cold hard truth is I've been waiting, I'm waiting
And as I fly away, you fly your life away
'Cause you and I were meant, we were meant to be alone, alone, alone
We were meant to be alone, alone, laying low

It's been a long time honey, honey, honey
You shouldn't laugh, it's not funny, funny, funny
After I'm done I feel lovely, lovely, lovely
Although I feel naked, sudden, sudden, -ly

And as I fly away, you fly your life away
'Cause you and I were meant, we were meant to be alone, alone, alone
We were meant to be alone

But the cold hard truth is I can make it without you
And the cold hard truth is I've waited too long
And the cold hard truth is I can make it without you
And the cold hard truth is I've waited forever

And as I fly away, you fly your life away
'Cause you and I were meant, we were meant
Yeah the cold hard truth is I can make it without you
And the cold hard truth is I've waited forever
The cold hard truth is I can make it without you
And the cold hard truth is, we were meant to be alone
We were meant to be alone, alone laying low
We were meant to be alone, alone, alone
We were meant to be alone, alone, laying low
