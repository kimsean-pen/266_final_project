Oh yeah
In france a skinny man
Died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle
And soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys
And their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called the disciples
High on crack, totin a machine gun

Time, time

Hurricane annie ripped the ceiling of a church
And killed everyone inside
U turn on the telly and every other story
Is tellin u somebody died
Sister killed her baby cuz she could afford 2 feed it
And were sending people 2 the moon
In september my cousin tried reefer 4 the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's june

Times, times

Its silly, no?
When a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants 2 fly
Some say a man aint happy
Unless a man truly dies
Oh why
Time, time

Baby make a speech, star wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn
Time, times

Its silly, no?
When a rocket blows
And everybody still wants 2 fly
Some say a man aint happy, truly
Until a man truly dies
Oh why, oh why, sign o the times

Time, time

Sign o the times mess with your mind
Hurry before it's 2 late
Lets fall in love, get married, have a baby
Well call him nate... if it's a boy

Time, time

Time, time
