All this anticipation
For you I'm accomodating
It's magic, a strange voodoo
When you're near the whole world turns to
Slow motion
When you're in the room
Slow motion
The way that you move
I want you
An addiction
Cause without you
There's something missing
I love it, it just feels right
Yeah, don't move, no
It kinda looks like
Slow motion
When you're in the room
Slow motion
The way that you move
Got offers on the table
But for you I'm ready and able
It's magic, a strange voodoo, but
When you're near the whole world turns to
Slow motion
The whole world turns to
Slow motion
The whole world turns to
Slow motion
When you're in the room
Slow motion
The way that you move
