I'm so restless
These walls drain my thoughts
Room 3-0-7
I can't find my way out

It used to be my home
This cage, far from my comfort zone
Alive but without control
Fear is taking hold

I should cross the line
Confront like the blind

Hear a distant cry
Would you tell me how
To break the cycle that I'm in
And discover the living?

I don't recognize my soul
Condemned to live in this black hole
Deep within time, and crave what is mine

Hear a distant cry
Would you tell me how
To break the cycle that I'm in
And discover the living?

I should cross the line
Confront like the blind

Hear a distant cry
Would you tell me how
To break the cycle that I'm in?

It's a hill to climb
Would you dream if I design the future
And not the end of time?
(Not the end of time)
