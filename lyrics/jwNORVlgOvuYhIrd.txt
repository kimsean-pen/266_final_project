My love is with you
Even though you're far away
You made me love you
And that's where my love will stay, darling

Those times I get lonely
You're the one who truly knows me
I can tell it in the way, darling
You show me, why don't you please come home, girl

Come on home, girl
You've been gone way to long, girl
Ooh, come on home, girl
Ooh oh

Yeah, as time goes by
My days go by slower
My nights are getting colder
Soon my heart is gonna strain

Why don't you please come home, girl?
Oh, come on home, girl
You've been gone way too long, girl
Oh, come on home, girl
Ooh, come on home, girl
Oh, come on home, girl
Oh, you've been gone way too long, girl
Oh, come on home, girl
Ooh, come home, yeah
Ooh, come on home, girl
You've been gone way too long, girl
Oh, come on home, girl
Oh please come home, girl
