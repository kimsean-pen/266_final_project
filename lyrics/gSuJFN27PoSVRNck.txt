Desperate contender
Tell me what you're after
Secret pretender
Just can keep together
I'm 27
I will live forever
7th heaven
Now I'll live forever

I cannot stay
Straight as a line
I cannot stay
To save my life
Save my life

My perfect contender
If I'm who you're after
Sober not ever
We can hide forever
Be my protector
Into ever after
Tiny heaven
I will live forever

I cannot stay
Straight as a line
I cannot stay
To save my life
Save my life
