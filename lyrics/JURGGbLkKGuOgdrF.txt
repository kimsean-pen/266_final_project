I saw this old friend
At the Eveleigh bar
Life hadn't treated him so well
A heart so gold
And words so blue
In a body home from hell

He said,
"If I could tell you one thing
I would tell you this
There's only one mistake that
I have made
It's giving up the music
In my fingertips
By tryna get to heaven
Through my veins"

All our lives
I watched you search beneath the
Fallen skies
This was no path to glory
You always walked before me
But you came back to warn me
All our lives

I saw this woman
With tears in her eyes
Driving beside me yesterday
She turned her head
Then I turned mine
Then I watched her drive away

I thought,
"If I could tell her something
I would tell her this
There's only two mistakes that
I have made
It's running from the people
Who could love me best
And trying to fix a world that
I can't change"

All our lives
I watched you search beneath the
Fallen skies
This was no path to glory
You always walked before me
But you came back to warn me
All our lives

(All our lives)
I remember being young
And staring at my hands
In the middle of the night
At the first light of the morning
(Morning, morning, morning, morning)
A room like a church
Voices down the hall,
I barely made 'em out,
But sometimes you don't want to know

(All our lives)
And now that I'm older
I can tell you this
The mornings I miss
But I don't really miss the voices
(Voices, voices, voices, voices)
You've got a choice
I've got the hands
Skeletons and plans,
You've got to let 'em go

All our lives
I watched you search beneath the
Falling skies

All our lives
I watched you search beneath the
Falling skies
This was no path to glory
You always walked before me
But you came back to warn me
All our lives

All our lives
I watched you search beneath the
Falling skies
This was no path to glory
You always walked before me
But you came back to warn me
All our lives
