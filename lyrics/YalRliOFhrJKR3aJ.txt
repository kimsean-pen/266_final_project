What if nothing's wrong?
What if that was all just a sad song?
Waves break when they want to
Get sad she did get a cue (? vs accused from some)
What if nothing's right
Nothing ever happens over night
I shouldn't put a (pay face)
This stuffs you just can't right until it's s wrong
Have to stay here til dawn
I can prove that I am not so far gone
But, I am not a monster
Just someone who wants to ...belong
No, I am not a monster
Just someone who wants to ...belong

What if I didn't do
All the things to me ...but to you?
Would you talk to me
So may get (to me but at all)

Would it be alright
To be the light that comes on at night?
I wouldn't burn too bright
Just enough so you might... get home

Have to stay here til dawn
I can prove that I am not so far gone
But I am not a monster
Just someone who wants to ...belong
No, I am not a monster
Just someone who wants to ...belong
No, I'm not a monster
Just someone who wants to belong
