The slayings at Bodom
From so long ago
Still carry a secret
Of which nobody knows
A seed that was planted as
The night turned to dawn
Will now bring me life
As the reaper's spawn

I am a bastard of Bodom
And I walk alone
As I follow the reaper
To lead me home
My victims shall perish
On the shores of this lake
As they look upon me to
Stare death in the face

I don't need a reason
And I won't tell you why
I'll just take you to hell
By the edge of my scythe!

I was born to end life
I can take any form
A shape shifting demon
Killing for sport
Like father, like son
This is my fate
Taking your lives
And breeding hate!

I don't need a reason
And I won't tell you why
I'll just take you to hell
By the edge of my scythe!
