it's all the same
so dull so plain
i need the spark the flame
to drag me out my insane, of my insane

only you and me
face to fate
come and lead me
to another place

a circle is my mind
a triangle is my soul
i move only behind
i must be reborn as a whole

(chorus)
only you and me
face to face
come and lead me
to another place
where i can taste
the black of purity
nothing more
nothing less
escape or seek a caress
after dark i feel
i smell the pain
i revive and heal
and this is my gain

it calls me near you
some cosmic will
i want to hold you
the lust to feel

it's all the same
so dull, so plain
i need the spark, the flame
to drag me out of my insane, of my insane

(chorus)
