I - Tide Pools
When the ebbing tide retreats along the rocky shoreline
It leaves a trail of tide pools in a short-lived galaxy
Each microcosmic planet a complete society
A simple kind of mirror to reflect upon our own
All the busy little creatures chasing out their destinies
Living in their pools they soon forget about the sea...

Wheel within wheels in a spiral array -
A pattern so grand and complex
Time after time we lose sight of the way -
Our causes can't see their effects

II - Hyperspace
A quantum leap forward in time and space
The universe learned to expand
Mess and magic, triumphant and tragic
A mechanized world out of hand
Computerized clinic for superior cynics
Who dance to a synthetic band
In their own image their world is fashioned
No wonder they don't understand

Wheel within wheels in a spiral array -
A pattern so grand and complex
Time after time we lose sight of the way -
Our causes can't see their effects

III - Permanent Waves
Science, like nature, must also be tamed
With a view towards its preservation
Given the same state of integrity, it will surely serve us well.
Art as expression, not as market campaigns
Will still capture our imaginations
Given the same state of integrity, it will surely help us along.
The most endangered species - the honest man -
Will still survive annihilation
Forming a world, a state of integrity -
Sensitive, open, and strong.
Wave after wave will flow with the tide
And bury the world as it does
Tide after tide will flow and recede
Leaving life to go on as it was.
