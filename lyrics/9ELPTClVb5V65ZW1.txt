The slumber of reason gives birth to all demons
A new battle takes form
Forced evolution to incite revolution
Rewrite the rules to play the game
As we struggle in the fight to survive,
Through strange domains and vicious ways
From the darkest depths we will arise
This realm will be their demise
They underestimated the force behind the hatred,
Grown with war on our minds
Lawlessness of their nightmare has left them unaware,
To the weakness they've exposed
We reach the summit in our climb to the top,
Through strange domains and vicious ways
In the darkest depths, a planned devised
Their spite for us is their demise
They've given us a devil's playground and all his deadliest toys
We must take all we've learned to destroy all they know
This nightmare logic, our greatest tool
Decimate the all-righteous fool
