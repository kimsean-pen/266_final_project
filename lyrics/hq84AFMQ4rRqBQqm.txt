I send your name
up into the sky
And the wind blows it back into my face

You see, even nature
reacts on me
And all my electricity
will make it across your sea

With every wave the sea makes
My body gets weaker
and weaker... and weaker.

You see, even nature
reacts on me
And all my electricity
will make it across your sea

And provides you
with my love
