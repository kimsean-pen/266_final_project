Yeah! Open!
Now let me see the way you work it
Let me see you work it
Just lay down...

You've got me right here where I need it
I'll hold out just as long as you, don't worry
Don't worry, we are, we're weak in the knees and I can't take this
Heat stroke, our burning bodies melt away
Just work it, just work

I've been...
I've been waiting, I've been waiting
I've been craving the way I need this
I will hold out just as long as you
(Tonight is the night we sink wishes deep into our skin)

Don't hold back, hold nothing back tonight
Oh, we'll let it take control, fusing you to me
Don't hold back, hold nothing back tonight
Oh, we'll let it take control, fusing you to me

Oh yeah!

Are you nervous?
Spending your days away in space, thicker than air, than air.
We've been waiting, we've been waiting
We've been craving the way we need this
I'll hold out just as long as you
(Tonight is the night we examine ourselves tip to tip)

Don't hold back, hold nothing back tonight
Oh, we'll let it take control, fusing you to me
Don't hold back, hold nothing back tonight
Oh, we'll let it take control, fusing you to me

Stop.

Look, just let this happen
...Just let it take control fusing you to me
...Just let it take control fusing you to me

Don't hold back, hold nothing back tonight
Oh, we'll let it take control, fusing you to me
Don't hold back, hold nothing back tonight, tonight
Oh, we'll let it take control, fusing you to me

Yeah Babe!
Now let me see the way you work it
Come on and take control right now, now, now, now...
