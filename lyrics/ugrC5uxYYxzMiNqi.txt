All those things that go to make heaven and this
Where midnight was, were splashed across the canvas
Midnight, who was a girl
Midnight, who lost control and found this world

With matter removed of divine dimension
Our time reduced to an honorable mention
This world, which time forgot
This world, it lost control and then saw God

All of the things that go to make heaven and earth are here
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth
Put your new weight in gold and see what it's worth
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth are here
All of the things that go to make heaven and this
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
Success was survival and, kid, it still is

Did you think of something He didn't think of?
Crashing into horizons, on the brink of success, hurrah
Success which was survival gone too far

All of the things that go to make heaven and earth are here
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth
Put your new weight in gold and see what it's worth
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth are here
All of the things that go to make heaven and this
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
