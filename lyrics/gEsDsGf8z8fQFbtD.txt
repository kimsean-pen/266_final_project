A stretch of road
A strip of film
A car that goes wherever it will
With the windows down
You know the drill

And every scene's a different place
Every minute's a mile I embrace
'Cause I would go anywhere
As long as it means
Your face pressed to the glass
Of the car I'm driving way too fast

Towards neon cities
Shining so pretty

I watch the tape
I press rewind
Cut out the parts where
We're not doing fine

So we stay pretty
So you still love me

I wanna be back
In your atmosphere
Lay on my back
'til the feeling's hyperreal
And my lungs begin to heal

I wanna take back
All the things I said
Subvert the actors and actresses
Make my life a movie where
You're the highlight reel

The moon's a stone
I've seen it up close
You keep it in a jar
The car careens
We stay in place
Every minute's a knot
That you unlace
Cause I would go anywhere
As long as it means
My face pressed to the glass
Of the car you're driving way too fast

Towards neon nothing
Just to feel something

I wanna be back
In your atmosphere
Lay on my back
'til the feeling's hyperreal
And my lungs begin to heal

I wanna take back
All the things I said
Subvert the actors and actresses
Make my life a movie where
You're the highlight reel

We blur past everything
I zoom in on your crooked smile
We blur past everything
I wanna stay inside your head
For a little while longer...

It's the scene when
The wind and I
Play with your hair

It's the part when
The tape ends
And you are no longer there
No longer there...
You are no longer there

I wanna be back
In your atmosphere
Lay on my back
'til the feeling's hyperreal
And my lungs begin to heal

I wanna take back
All the things I said
Subvert the actors and the actresses
Make my life a movie where
You're the highlight reel

We blur past everything
I wanna stay inside your head
For a little while longer
