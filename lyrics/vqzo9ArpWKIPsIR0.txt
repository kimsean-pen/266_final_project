Our minds, our bodies, our feelings
They change, they alter, they leave us
Somehow, no matter what happens
I'm here
The time, the season, the weather
The song, the music, the rhythm
It seems, no matter what happens
I'm here

Daylight seems bright because of night
It's shade we need
So we can see

Our love, our beauty, our genius
Our work, our triumph, our glory
Won't worry what happened before me
I'm here

Our minds, our bodies, our feelings
They change, they alter, they leave us
Somehow, no matter what happens
I'm here
The time, the season, the weather,
The song, the music, the rhythm,
It seems, no matter what happens
I'm here

Daylight seems bright because of night
The change we need
So we can see

Our love, our beauty, our genius
Our work, our triumph, our glory
Won't worry what happened before me
I'm here

Our love, our beauty, our genius
Our worth, our triumph, our glory
Don't worry what happened before me
I'm here

Our love, our beauty, our genius
Our worth, our triumph, our glory
Won't worry what happened before me
I'm here

I'm here
I'm here
I'm here
