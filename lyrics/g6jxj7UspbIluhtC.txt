Get Behind Me
It's the signs as we see them
There's no thresholds at all
There's no vows to be broken
As we rise, or we fall
There's no noise high above us
As the moon turns in space
Just the face of a lady
Who we loved for her grace

Get behind me, Get behind me
Won't you bend my ear again
I really need a friend
Get behind me, Get behind me
Remind me to remind me
Not to go back there again

When the threads of dark moments
Start to tremble with sound
And an almost formed whisper dies
The boundaries surround
We keep reaching beyond us
Through the shape shifting clouds
Why ain't I like you brother
So electric, so proud

Get behind me, Get behind me
Won't you bend my ear again
I really need a friend
Get behind me, Get behind me
Remind me to remind me
Not to go back there again

Set us free of this feeling
So we'll be once again
So we won't feel the gravity of time
And the face in the faces
Of the loves we move through
Reappears in original design

Get behind me, Get behind me
Won't you bend my ear again
I really need a friend
Get behind me, Get behind me
Remind me to remind me
Not to go back there again
