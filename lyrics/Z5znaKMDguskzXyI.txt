Show the way
Point to nothing
Show the way
Profit from loss

Time is space
Tick tick ticking
Slow decay
Ascend across

Love percolates
Fill up the cup or pour out the shame
The candlelight burns the room we use for light to ash and dust

Clone the same light the flame
Prove that this sham will save me

Heal the thirst of knowledge
Turn a blind eye forward

Good things come to those who wait
Always over compensate
Watching the blood percolate
Hide the keys within their faith
Hide within the shadow

Brainwashed into who you trust
Your lungs filled with ash and dust
Take that final breath
Brainwashed to in who you trust
Hide within the shadow

Secular forbidden thoughts
Put them underground
Smother them from life

Always unforgiven
Enslave all the living
Your lungs filled with ash and dust
Put them underground
Smother them from life
Good things come to those who wait
Constant sleep

Watch it collapse
Watch shit collapse
