They say I get away with murder, ahh

I took a dose of your medicine
You tell me to leave but I come back again
I don't see what all the fuss is about 'cuz I'm okay
Soon you will see that I got ability to get my ways

So don't keep me in the dark 'cuz I'll find the light
Find the light
Don't keep me in the the dark 'cuz I'll find the light
Don't, don't, don't

I said, don't keep in the dark 'cuz I'll find the light
Find the light
Don't keep in the dark, don't keep in the dark

I was alone until I found Johnny
And he was a good boy until he got behind me
No, she didn't, yes, she did

I got a monkey on my back
He helping me get it off, he helping me get it off, ooh
I got a monkey on my back
He helping me get it off, he helping me get it off

So don't keep me in the dark 'cuz I'll find the light
Find the light
Don't keep me in the the dark 'cuz I'll find the light
Don't, don't, don't

I said, don't keep in the dark 'cuz I'll find the light
Find the light
Don't keep in the dark, don't keep in the dark

Skeletons and all the bones in your closet
Come out late at night and chase you around your room, room, room
You gon' call, you can call me, you know you can trust me
Without me you're headed to your doom, doom, doom

This kid's P.I.I., call me the whiz kid but not the F.B.I.
I'm on your side, I'm not the I Spy
You can go scot free, I'll be your alibi

I'm your sunshine concubine
You make it so easy for me to cry
I'm your sunshine concubine
My fears turn black in the moonlight

I got a monkey on my back
He helping me get it off, he helping me get it off, ooh
I got a monkey on my back
He helping me get it off

I got a monkey on my back
He helping me get it off, he helping me get it off
I got a monkey on my back
He helping me get it off

So don't keep me in the dark 'cuz I'll find the light
Find the light
Don't keep me in the the dark 'cuz I'll find the light
Don't, don't, don't

I said, don't keep in the dark 'cuz I'll find the light
Find the light
Don't keep in the dark, don't keep in the dark

I got away with it, I got away it, ahh
I got away with it, I got away it

They say I get away with murder, ah, ah, ah
They say I get away with murder, ah, ah, ah
They say I get away with murder, ah, ah, ah
They say I get away with murder, ah, ah, ah
They say that I get away with murder
