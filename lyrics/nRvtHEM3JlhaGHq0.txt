To those of you I loved
This pains me to lose
I hate to feel used

I'm frightened in sleep
Thinking my world will be gone
Promise me i won't die
I panic in dreams
From when i was still young
Please don't turn on that light
I can't see it

To those of you I've lost
That pained me to love

Please know that i tried
I'm frightened in sleep
Thinking my world will be gone
Promise me i won't die
I panic in dreams
From when i was still young
Please don't turn on that light

I can't see it

Do you really think
That i would leave you
But i couldn't stand myself
So i had to choose
Still you turn me on
The wild in your eyes

But now i can't trust myself
To keep on the light for us to see with

I'm frightened in sleep
Thinking my world will be gone
Promise me i won't die
I panic in dreams
From when i was still young
Please don't turn on that light
I can't see it
