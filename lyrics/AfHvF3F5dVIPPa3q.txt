All I need, all I need
I need something easy

You walked right in as I was closing my door
I'm just escaping from the eye of the storm
I didn't mean to tumble into your arms
They're not my baby's but they're keeping me warm

Cause you touch my skin and the pain is faded
You're my medicine and I want to take it

I want something easy
Why don't you just lay your hands on me
Give me what I need
Easy
Go on and just heal my hungry heart
Get me through this part
All I need, all I need
I need something easy

You were a candle and I'm scared of the dark
I couldn't handle this, without you I'm lost
I'm sorry baby, cause I know you want more
Slow down the pace until my heart is off the floor

Cause you touch my skin and the pain is faded
You're my medicine and I want to take it

I want something easy
Why don't you just lay your hands on me
Give me what I need
Easy
Go on and just heal my hungry heart
Get me through this part
All I need, all I need
I need something easy

Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Cause I don't know how to be alone
When I'm on my own I'm afraid to close my eyes
Hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me
Cause when you're here with me, all I have to feel
Is your body here, laying next to mine

Cause you touch my skin and the pain is faded
You're my medicine and I want to take it

I want something easy
Why don't you just lay your hands on me
Give me what I need
Easy
Go on and just heal my hungry heart
Get me through this part
All I need, all I need
I need something easy
All I need, all I need
Baby, baby, baby
