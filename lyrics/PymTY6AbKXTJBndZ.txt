If we're in love
If we're in love
If we're in love

If we're in love
If we're in love
If we're in love
We should make love

Where the sun it never sets
And where the wind forgets
I will forget you
Where the sky goes on for miles
And never ties
Of an improbable blue
When the supreme mysteries
Decide to reveal all to us
And make an endless night
Still I will come to remember

If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we should make love
When will we be lovers?

If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we could make love
When will that be?

I'm gonna forget you
When the rivers stop and turn to run
To where they've begun
Back up the mountainside
When the sun it comes to the night to play
And like I do just sleep all day
When the moon and the stars turn to the light
Not in the dark of night
But in the morning sky
When the roses turn to bloom
Not in June
But in the bitter cold of December
There's not a
There's not a joy in this whole world to give
There's not a joy
As lovely as the bird that flew away

Last night I
Last night I
I think I dreamt a
Beautiful song
But when I woke
The birds had flown
And it was gone

If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we should make love
When will we be lovers?

If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we could make love
When will that be?

If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we should make love
When will we be lovers?

If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we should make love
When will that be?

If we're in love
If we're in love

If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we should make love
When will we be lovers?

If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we could make love
When will that be?

If we're in love we should make love
If we
If we're in love we should make love
If we
If we're in love we should make love
When will we be lovers?

If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we should make love
If we're in love we should make love
When will that be?
