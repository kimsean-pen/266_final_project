You've got me poppin' champagne
I'm at it again
Caught up in the moment
But not in the right way
I'm falling in between
Tearing up at the seams
We're just aiming to please
& aesthetics don't hurt one bit

So follow me down
Take this all the way
Any way you want to

Why don't you say so?
I think I'm caught in between
The nights & days fly by when I'm lost on the streets
& my eyes, they despise you for who I am
Why don't you say so?
Why don't you say so?
You've got me thinking that

Lately I've been wishin
The television set
Would show me more
Than just a picture of
The things I've grown to detest
I strip down my dignity
They can take all of me

But they won't ever take what I still believe
So follow me down
Take this all the way

Any way you want to
Why don't you say so?
I think I'm caught in between
The nights & days fly by when I'm lost on the streets
& my eyes, they despise you for who I am
Why don't you say so?
Why don't you say so?
Give up, & let go
I'm just a boy with a dream
& you can take one look as I fall in between
With my eyes just as wide as my mouth can be
Why don't you say so?
Why don't you say so?
I know, I know, I know that there's a place for me somewhere

Out there
I know, I know, I know that there's a place for me somewhere
Out there
Why don't you say so?

I think I'm caught in between
The nights & days fly by when I'm lost on the streets
My eyes, they despise you for who I am
Why don't you say so?
Why don't you say so?
Give up, & let go
I'm just a boy with a dream
& you can take one look as I fall in between
With my eyes just as wide as my mouth can be
Why don't you say so?
Why don't you say so?
