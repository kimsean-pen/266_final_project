i look high, i look low
i'm lookin' everywhere i go
lookin' for a home

in the heart of the country
i'm gonna move, i'm gonna go
i'm gonna tell everyone i know

lookin' for a home
in the heart of the country

heart of the country

where the holy people grow
heart of the country
smell the grass in the meadow

well, well, well
want horse, i want sheep

i want to get me a good night's sleep
livin' in a home

in the heart of the country

i'm gonna move, i'm gonna go
i'm gonna tell everyone i know
livin' in a home

in the heart of the country
heart of the country
where the holy people grow

heart of the country
smell the grass in the meadow

well, well, well
want horse, i want sheep
i want to get me a good night's sleep
livin' in a home
in the heart of the country
i'm gonna move, i'm gonna go
i'm gonna tell everyone i know...
in the heart of the country
heart of the country
where the holy people grow
heart of the country
smell the grass in the meadow
well, well, well
