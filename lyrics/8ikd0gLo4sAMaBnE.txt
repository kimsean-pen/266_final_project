Isolation can put a gun your hand
It can put a gun your hand, it can put a gun your hand
If you need to you can get away from the sun
You can get away from the sun, you can get away from the sun
If you need to you can get away from the sun
If you need to you can throw away the only one

I'm so tired, I can never lay down my head
I can never lay down my head, I can never lay down my head
I'm so lonely, but I can never quite reach the phone
But I can never quite reach the phone, but I can never quite reach the phone
I'm so lonely, but I can never quite reach the phone
I'm so lonely, I've gotta eat my popcorn all alone

Isolation can put a gun your hand
It can put a gun your hand, it can put a gun your hand
If you need to you can get away from the sun
You can get away from the sun, you can get away from the sun
If you need to you can get away from the sun
If you need to you can throw away the only one
