He would break his leg
Look at me and say
Its gonna be a while
But I'll be back some day
Nothing can really stop me
Steady burning slow
One hand in the air
And the other on the buffalo
Buffalo-o

Though it was blowing heavy
He never turned away
Knowing damn well
That he would die some day
Nothing could really stop me
You're never gonna know
One hand in the air
And the other on the buffal...
