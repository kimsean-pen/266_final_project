Oh love
Let me
Do right
Do wrong

I'm close
Oh love
You did
Me harm

Oh love
I got lost in love and lost in love away
Except for me

Oh love
I got lost in love and lost in love away
Except for me

I love her
Like no other love
Just let me
Let me discover

Oh love
I got lost in love and lost in love away
Except for me

Oh love
I got lost in love and lost in love away
Except for me

I got to say I'm sorry
Wash my sins away

Wash my sins away
