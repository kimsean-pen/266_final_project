Seem to found a familiar face
In a place where there's no names
And you learn to appreciate
All the things we take in vein

Hold on tight and enjoy the ride girl
This is all that we get, that you get girl
It feels right and I know you can tell
But I'm not going to lie, this is no spell

I'm not worried and I'm not afraid
What we have should be displayed
No matter what the others may say
We will always stay this way

Hold on tight and enjoy the ride girl
This is all that we get, that you get girl
It feels right and I know you can tell
But I'm not going to lie, this is no spell
This is no spell, this is no spell

When all the world is gone and dead
I'll still be the one to hold your hand
When all the world is gone and dead

Hold on tight and enjoy the ride girl
This is all that we get, that you get girl
It feels right and I know you can tell
But I'm not going to lie, this is no spell

Hold on tight and enjoy the ride girl
This is all that we get, that you get girl
It feels right and I know you can tell
But I'm not going to lie, this is no spell

When all the world is gone and dead
I'll still be the one to hold your hand
When all the world is gone and dead
