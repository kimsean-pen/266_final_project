Here he comes, baby, here comes your lover man
Here he comes, here comes your lover man
I see him out your window, baby
Leap out as fast as I can
Reach up, baby those are my runnin' shoes
Reach up, baby, and let me get my runnin' shoes
See your man coming, I've got no time to lose
I wanna love you longer than even
I wanna love you stronger, stronger than even
I wanna love you all night long than even
If that's your man, baby, over yonder
