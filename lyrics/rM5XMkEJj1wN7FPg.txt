Another familiar accident changes where I call home
The thing that I needed the most was to simply be alone
Away from the Baltimore winter and trying to maintain
Quiet and calm disposition despite a heart in pain

So I look to stars and I look to the sea
And I look to the faces on the street
And I look to the sky and I look to the moon
And I look to the future as it blooms

I watched a birth of a minute, an hour and a year
But how the days turn to ribbons of time still seems unclear
Watch how an instinct gets changed into wrinkles, pain and death
Watch all my memories collect as I take a final breath

And as it blooms here
Somewhere else breaks
The world is always half asleep and half awake
And when it aches here
Somewhere else blooms
The light I see reflected off the darkest moon
