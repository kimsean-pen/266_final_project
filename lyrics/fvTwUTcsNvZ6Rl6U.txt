I broke into our home
Had we even been living here all along?
And I forget who I'm with
All I remember is trying to get here safe

And your face, that I know
And your face, that I know says
Night falls... and day breaks
I was only thinking 'bout trying it out
I was only thinking 'bout trying it out

I break into our place
Step back and take a look at what has changed
And when I turn around I see you lying on the ground, it's you
When I go down as myself, I don't come up with someone else, it's true

And your face, that I know
And your face, that I know says
What comes over you when you wish you were somewhere else?
I can look after you
But, girl, you should look after yourself
'Cause night falls... and day breaks
I was only thinking 'bout trying it out
I was only thinking 'bout trying it out

When night falls and I'm all thinking about trying it out
And day breaks, and I can't help it, I can't help it
Day breaks and I can't help it, breaks
