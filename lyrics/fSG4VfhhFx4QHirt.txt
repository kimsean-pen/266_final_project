Hard Rock Hallelujah!
Hard Rock Hallelujah!

Hard Rock Hallelujah!
Hard Rock Hallelujah!
The saints are crippled

On the sinners' night
Lost are the lambs with no guiding light
The walls come down like thunder
The rock's about to roll

It's the Arockalypse
Now bare your soul
All we need is lightning
With power and might
Striking down the prophets of false
As the moon is rising

Give us the sign
Now let us rise up in awe
Rock 'n Roll angels bring that Hard Rock Hallelujah
Demons and angels all in one have arrived

Rock 'n Roll angels bring that Hard Rock Hallelujah
In God's creation supernatural high
The true believers

Thou shall be saved
Brothers and sisters, keep strong in the faith
On the day of Reckoning
It's who dares, wins

You will see the jokers soon'll be the new kings
All we need is lightning
With power and might
Striking down the prophets of false
As the moon is rising
Give us the sign

Now let us rise up in awe
Rock 'n Roll angels bring that Hard Rock Hallelujah
Demons and angels all in one have arrived
Rock 'n Roll angels bring that Hard Rock Hallelujah

In God's creation supernatural high
Wings on my back
I got horns on my head
My fangs are sharp
And my eyes are red
Not quite an angel
Or the one that fell

Now choose to join us or go straight to Hell
Hard Rock Hallelujah!
Hard Rock Hallelujah!
Hard Rock Hallelujah!
Hard Rock Yeah!
Rock 'n Roll angels bring that Hard Rock Hallelujah
Demons and angels all in one have arrived
Rock 'n Roll angels bring that Hard Rock Hallelujah
In God's creation supernatural high
Rock 'n Roll angels bring that Hard Rock Hallelujah
Rock 'n Roll angels bring that Hard Rock Hallelujah
Hard Rock Hallelujah!
Hard Rock Hallelujah!
