Behold Tomorrow
Dreams Shadow
Sons Follow The Waking Eye
Behold Tomorrow
Seer's Shadow
Brothers Follow Beyond The Sky

Soothsayer
Prophecy
Waking Eye
Sanctity

A Glaring Dream
A Garden in Her Pure Pristine
She Held A Thorn
Growing Tall And Strong

Into Heaven Raising High
A Stem Shining Golden White
Still Underneath
Bright Bloody Red The Earth

The Grace Of Premonition
Embrace My Dawning Fate

A Wanted Dream
Revealed To Him On Sordid Beds
A Man Of Deeds
Golden Ringlets On His Head

Son Of Heaven Reaching Down
So lively So Sound
One Shall Unfold
A Vision Of His Son On This Earth

One Day He Will Stand Up Tall
The Waking Eye
He Shall Gather One And All
Beyond The Sky
Waking Eye

Hail The Gods We Stand Up Tall
Arise Above The Darkened Call

With The Chieftains Side By Side
Men Of Legends Curse The Storms

Kingdom Glory
Dreams Shadow
One Life Story
Waves To Halo
