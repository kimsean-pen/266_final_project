Got your shoppin' at the speed of sound
Start poppin' down the Megapound
If you can, then you should
Walk, walkin' on the yellow line
Tick-tockin' 'cause we're so out of time
But for now, we've got so much to do, why?
We're the high society
We're the high society
Where we do what we want
And we want what we do to be free
Tip-tappin' at a telephone
Talk, talkin' with those other drones
As they fly overhead and they see how much we spend on shoes, yeah
Lost shoppin' at the Megastore
Keep truckin' in the four-by-four
Keep buyin' milk by the bulk 'cause
the kids love the cartoon cow, why?
'Cause we're the high society
We're the high society
Where we do what we want
And we want what we do to be free
We're the high society
In the city the riot is
And we do what we like
And we like what we do to be free
(High society)
(High society)
We're the high society
We're the high society
Where we do what we want
And we want what we do to be free
'Cause we're the high society
And we're riddled with anxiety
And we do what we want
And we want what we do to be free
Free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free
