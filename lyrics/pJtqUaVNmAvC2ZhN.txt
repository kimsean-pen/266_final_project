No matter where you are, lighters up
We're gonna start a riot tonight, tonight, tonight
Put your hands up to the sky
Flames so red like bludfire, fire

Burn it up, burn it up, like a bludfire
Light it up, light it up, like a bludfire
Burn it up, burn it up, like a bludfire
Blud, blud, blud, bludfire
Bludfire
Bludfire

No matter where you are, lighters up
We're gonna start a riot tonight, tonight, tonight
Put your hands up to the sky
Flames so red like bludfire, fire

Burn it up, burn it up, like a bludfire
Light it up, light it up, like a bludfire
Burn it up, burn it up, like a bludfire
Blud, blud, blud, bludfire
Bludfire

It's like a rave oh tonight's all bludfire
Can you here the noise out there
It's like a rave we burn it down like bludfire
