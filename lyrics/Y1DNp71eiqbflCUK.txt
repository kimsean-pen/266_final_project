Nothing's so loud
As hearing when we lie
The truth is not kind
And you've said neither am I
And the air outside so soft
Is saying everything, everything
All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, I feel it say
Nothing's so cold
As closing the heart when all we need
Is to free the soul
But we wouldn't be that brave I know
And the air outside so soft
Confessing everything, everything
All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, I feel it say
And it won't matter now
Whatever happens will be
Though the air speaks of all we'll never be
It won't trouble me
All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, I feel it say
(All I want is to feel this way) it feels
(To be this close, to feel the same) so close
(All I want is to feel this way) let it take
(The evening speaks, I feel it say) me in
(All I want is to feel this way) let it hold
(To be this close, to feel the same) me so
(All I want is to feel this way) I can feel
(The evening speaks, I feel it say) it say
