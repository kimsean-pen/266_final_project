Oh oh no oh yea yea

The fights, those nights
I tried to pretend it don't hurt
The way, I prayed
Someday that you would love me
Really, completely
Just how I wanted it to be
But no, so wrong
Can't believe I stayed with you so long

You hit, you spit, you split, every bit of me, yeah
You stole, you broke, you're cold
You're such a joke to me, yeah

For every last bruise you gave me
For every time I sat in tears
For the million ways you hurt me
I just wanna tell you this
You broke my world, made me strong
Thank you
Messed up my dreams, made me strong
Thank you

My head, near dead
Just the way you want it
My soul, stone cold
Cause I was under your control
So young, so dumb
Knew just how to make me succum
But I understand
To make yourself feel like a man

You hit, you spit, you split, every bit of me, yeah
You stole, you broke, you're cold
You're such a joke to me, yeah
Thank you

For every last bruise you gave me
For every time I sat in tears
For the million ways you hurt me
I just wanna tell you this
You broke my world, made me strong
Thank you
Messed up my dreams, made me strong
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you

It coulda been so right (so right)
I woulda given you everything (everything)
Morning through night
Yeah, you taught me some lessons (lessons)
Those are my blessings (blessings)

Thank you

For every last bruise you gave me
For every time I sat in tears
For the million ways you hurt me
I just wanna tell you this
You broke my world, made me strong
Thank you
Messed up my dreams, made me strong
Thank you
