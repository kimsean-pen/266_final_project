How can you wait in the wash of rain?
You're soaked to your feet
Still, you said you'd wait for me

& these days, they grow so old
& I'll never show
I thought they new
I'm fickle & slow, & I'll never do

This cool blue water
In this feeling you brought to me
There's a cool blue heart you're keeeping
Whenever you start to leave

I was up every night
A phantom of myself, beside
She rattled my bones
(Do you think I fit the part?)
I'll never grow
It's all that I know

These things, they slow
Maybe, they should

This cool blue water
In this feeling you brought to me
There's a cool blue heart you're keeping
Whenever you start to leave
This cool blue water
In this feeling you brought to me
There's a cool blue heart you're keeping
Whenever you start to leave
