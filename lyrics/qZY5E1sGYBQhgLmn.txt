Monday morning, I saw you standing
Somewhere central, calling up the
Head down, you didn't see me
That's fine, it wasn't meant to be
That's fine, it wasn't meant to be

We were close
Many fields of gold
We'd sit there watching
But then it got too slow

Passing through me
That's fine, it wasn't meant to be
Maybe next time, I'll say hello
Somewhere central, leaving to slow
To slow
To slow

Sky split... [?]
Head down, you didn't see me
That's fine, it wasn't meant to be
That's fine, it wasn't meant to be

Men change, lives can be much quicker
Shine bright, but stagger in to flicker
Look up, and stop to see... [?]

Maybe next time I'll say hello
Somewhere central, leaving to slow
To slow
To slow
