It's mine, it's mine
I don't think you hear me
Join and speak up
In total victory
It's mine
Can I get a witness?
Somebody think about it as good as guarantee
Bless you one time
Lord said only one time
And I will say it over, over, and over, and
His loving fever
I don't know if you fell that thing yet
But come one, wouldn't say it again with me
Joy that come from knowing
His love over me is flowing
Everybody you need to know
That you can rest in him
There He is
Merciful to the grace beyond belief
He just keeps on pouring his everlasting love
Do you feel me?
This thing is overflowing my family
It's mine, it's mine
As I bless him
For the things that he's prepared for me
