Tonight
You could be my new revival, in my mind
We could go a thousand miles
Such a long way from home
When the odds are so low, we'll survive
Yeah, we'll survive

When I'm three feet from the edge
Will I break before I bend?
I'm only human, ashes to dust
Making a mess of us
Where the words fall from your lips
To save this sinking ship
Give me a sign to keep my heart beating
Throw me a line in over my head

Fear is the end of love
Don't tell me that you're giving up
Fear is the end of love
Don't tell me that you're giving up
Fight like the underdog
Don't tell me that you've had enough
Left, right, left, we're marching on
We're marching on
We're marching on

Wide awake
You could be my new direction, face to face
Staring at my own reflection
When the smoke clears at dawn
And the ghosts carry on, I'll be brave
Yeah, I'll be brave

When I'm three feet from the edge
Will I break before I bend?
I'm only human, ashes to dust
Making a mess of us
Where the words fall from your lips
To save this sinking ship
Give me a sign to keep my heart beating
Throw me a line in over my head

Fear is the end of love
Don't tell me that you're giving up
Fear is the end of love
Don't tell me that you're giving up
Fight like the underdog
Don't tell me that you've had enough
Left, right, left, we're marching on
We're marching on
We're marching on
We're marching on

When the sun goes down and the heavens fall
Yeah, I know we gave it all
Promise me we'll ride
No, it won't be long
Let 'em know we're marching on
We're marching on

Fear is the end of love
Don't tell me that you're giving up
Fear is the end of love
Don't tell me that you're giving up
Fight like the underdog
Don't tell me that you've had enough
Left, right, left, we're marching on
We're marching on
We're marching on
We're marching on
