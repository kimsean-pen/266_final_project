Animals are wild, no matter the breed
You can see it in their eyes, they're taking it in
Before you have the chance to know where you stand
You're between a mom and lamb
She's sinking her teeth in

Like nobody's watching
Like nobody's watching

People are the same, there's hunters and prey
There's rules to the game
You can win for a day
Now I'm old enough to know
It all comes around
Cause the war is in between
We're taking ourselves down

Like nobody's watching
Like nobody's watching

Never did I think that this could be me
But I'm stealing heavily from the powers that be
It's not personal this time, I'm here to survive
So I smile and we shake, then I sharpen my blade

Like nobody's watching
Like nobody's watching
Like nobody's watching
Like nobody's watching

Nobody's watching so
I'll just take a little off the top if no one's paying attention
I'll just take a little off the top if no one's paying attention
I'll just take a little off the top if no one's paying attention
I'll just take a little off the top if no one's paying attention
I'll just take a little off the top if no one's paying attention
I'll just take a little off the top if no one's paying attention
I'll just take a little off the top if no one's paying attention
I'll just take a little off the top if no one's paying attention

Like nobody's watching
Like nobody's watching

I made it to the top but don't know when to stop (nobody's watching)
When I take, I take a lot
I made it to the top but don't know when to stop (nobody's watching)
When I take, I take a lot
I made it to the top but don't know when to stop (nobody's watching)
When I take, I take a lot
I made it to the top but don't know when to stop (nobody's watching)
When I take, I take a lot
I made it to the top but don't know when to stop (nobody's watching)
When I take, I take a lot
