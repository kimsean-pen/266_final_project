Forgive me if my fantasies might seem a little shopworn
I'm sure you've heard it all before
I wonder what's the right form
Love songs written for you
It's been going down for years
But to sing what's in my heart seems more honest than the tears

I am curious
Don't want to hurry us
I'm intrigued with us
Ain't this song a bust
I don't care
Dark Star

I met you several years ago
The times, they were so strange but I had a feeling
You looked into my eyes just once
An instant flashing by that we were stealing
Another time you felt so bad
And I wasn't any help at all as I recall
We didn't know quite what to do so we left the wanting be
Still there for me and you

Dark Star
I see you in the morning
Dark Star
A-sleeping next to me
Dark Star
Let the memory of the evening
Be the first thing that you think of
When you open up your smile and see me, Dark Star

It's easy to be with you
Even with the storms that rage beneath your search for peace
We must make some time together
Take the kids and find a world that's ours to keep

And now you've got me dreaming girl
It's been so long, I thought that I'd forgotten how
My heart is once again my soul
We touched, we did, you know we did
No more teasing now

Dark Star
I see you in the morning
Dark Star
Sleeping next to me
Dark Star
Let the memory of the evening
Be the first thing that you think of
When you open up your smile and see me, Dark Star

Dark Star
I see you in the morning
Dark Star
A-sleeping next to me
Dark Star
Let the memory of the evening
Be the first thing that you think of
When you open up your smile and see me, Dark Star

Let the memory of the evening
Be the first thing that you think of
When you open up your smile and see me, Dark Star
