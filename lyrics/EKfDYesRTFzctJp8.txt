Baby, do you belive in me
Because I believe in you
Until the tide has come
Baby, do you belive in me
Becasue I belive in you
Until the love is gone

Just hum with me
Til the morning comes
Just hum with me
So I can hear you
Just hum with me
Til the morning comes
Just hum with me

DROP

Baby, put your tries to me
Like I tries to you
Til the tide has come
Baby, reach out for the sun
Never turn around, until the love is gone

Just hum with me
Til the morning comes
Just hum with me
So I can hear you
Just hum with me
Til the morning comes
Just hum with me

DROP

Hum with me
Hum with me
