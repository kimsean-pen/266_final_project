I don't think you know my name
I'm the invisible girl
Trapped in thoughts about me and you
I don't know where to take this
Can you give me a clue? What should I do?

And I'm standing here patiently
And I'm waiting for you to see me
Toss my hair, my intriguing stare
Everything that should make you care
But I'm the invisible girl

So many times you looked my way
I'm the invisible girl
That you have just not never seem to see
I wish you'd open up your eyes and see me for me
And all we can be

And I'm standing here patiently
And I'm waiting for you to see me
Toss my hair, my intriguing stare
Everything that should make you care
But I'm the invisible girl

I'm no J.Lo or Miss Spears
I'm just a girl who disappears
Every time you walk my way
I just don't know what to say

Go to the beach
And run through the rain
Stretch beyond your reach
Take a flight to Spain

Don't you see how great it'd be
If you could just only see
I'm not the invisible girl

Don't you see how great it'd be
If you could just only see
I'm not the invisible girl
