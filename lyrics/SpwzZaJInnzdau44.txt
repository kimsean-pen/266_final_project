On the downtown train
With my ball and Shane When the clock strikes eight
A chain reaction
I've been on the floor
I've been shown the door
That's what's next in store
A chain reaction
I couldn't be satisfied
Cause they dragged out of my dream
I sat for the stud light
Need to carefully hide my spine (A chain reaction)
We fall like dominos (A chain reaction)
We fall like dominos (A chain reaction)
You and me
Everybody goes
Like dominos (A chain reaction)
I could snap, crack, pop
Gonna rip it up
When you hit the spot
A chain reaction
Wa-wa-watch him shake
I could blue that red
I could drop down dead
A chain reaction I,
I know what [?] like
There's a diamond lost in my mind
Up, up and away I go
Need to carefully hide my spine (A chain reaction)
We fall like dominos (A chain reaction)
We fall like dominos (A chain reaction)
You and me
Everybody goes I don't wanna think about the morning after I don't wanna stick around [?] I don't wanna move [?]
Everybody let's go (Like dominos)
(Like dominos)
(A chain reaction)
We fall like dominos
(A chain reaction)
We fall like dominos
(A chain reaction)
You and me
Everybody goes
We fall like dominos
(A chain reaction)
We fall like dominos
(A chain reaction)
We fall like dominos
(A chain reaction)
You and me
Everybody goes
(Like dominos)
