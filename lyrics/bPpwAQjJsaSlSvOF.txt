It just started like a friend thing
It just started with a joke
She's pretending to be waiting

But you are laughing with a frown
She acts too crazy
Always whatever for [?]
She always burns her warts

Don't let her waste your smile
Don't let her curse your eyes
Don't let her waste your smile
Don't let her curse your eyes

She's becoming like an angel
She's gonna beat you bad
You pretend you are resistant
But she's wishing [?] than a [?]
And you [?] tender
But she's not a lover mind
She has more [?]
But you'll be here, ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba

Don't let her waste your smile
Don't let her curse your eyes
Don't let her waste your smile
Don't let her curse your eyes

Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba
