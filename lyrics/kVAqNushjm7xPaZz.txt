Here, here I am again.
And I'm starin' at these same four walls.
Alone again.
And now, all the colors blend.
And I'm growing numb and I've become.
This empty page.

Hold on, it's tragic.
Stumbling through all this static.

I just wanna talk to you and my.
Broken heart just has no use and I.
Guess promises are better.
Left unsaid.

Yeah.
Everytime you try to tell me.
You say the words that I'm the only.
But I'm the one who's crawling on the ground.

When you say love makes the world go round.
My love, look at what you've done to me.
For someone who has felt so strong.

It's amazing I'm completely gone.
Hold on, it's tragic.

Stumbling through all this static.
I just wanna talk to you and my.
Broken heart just has no use and I.
Guess promises are better

Left unsaid.
Yeah.
Everytime you try to tell me.
Say you the words that I'm the only.

But I'm the one who's crawling on the ground.
When you say love makes the world go round.
If that's the kind of love you give me.
I'd rather be alone, believe me.

It's not the way you 'posed to treat me.
I'd rather walk away.
I just wanna talk to you and my.
Broken heart just has no use.

And I guess promises are better.
Left unsaid.
Yeah.
Everytime you try to tell me.
Say you the words that I'm the only.
But I'm the one who's crawling on the ground.
When you say love makes the world go round. Yeah.
You say love makes the world go round.
Everytime you try to tell me.
I don't care you're not the only.
Don't you know I'm coming back around.
'Cuz I say love makes the world go round.
Yeah.
'Cuz I say love makes the world go round.
End.
