So can I just once dance like you do
Outshine the disco lights as you use to do
And just for tonight I will turn myself loose
Outshine the disco lights with your dancing shoes

Will you teach me how to dance?
Show me all your greatest moves
You put the music on and I
Will wear your dancing shoes

Dancing shoes, dancing shoes
Dancing shoes oh ooh
Dancing shoes, dancing shoes
Dancing shoes oooh
Dancing shoes, dancing shoes
Dancing shoes oh ooh
Dancing shoes, dancing shoes
Dancing shoes ooh

Dancing shoes, dancing shoes
Dancing shoes oh ooh
Dancing shoes, dancing shoes
Dancing shoes oooh
Dancing shoes, dancing shoes
Dancing shoes oh ooh
Dancing shoes, dancing shoes
Dancing shoes ooh

Will you teach me how to dance?
Show me all your greatest moves
You put the music on and I
Will wear your dancing shoes

Will you teach me how to dance?
Will you teach me how to dance?

I will never stop to dance
In a hassle I found out
It wasn't really hard to start
Now I don't know how to stop
I've lost you from my sight
You were here a song ago
And now the glitter on my hands
Doesn't seem so colorful

So can I just once dance like you do
Outshine the disco lights as you use to do
And just for tonight I will turn myself loose
Outshine the disco lights with your dancing shoes

Dancing shoes, dancing shoes
Dancing shoes oh ooh
Dancing shoes, dancing shoes
Dancing shoes oooh
Dancing shoes, dancing shoes
Dancing shoes oh ooh
Dancing shoes, dancing shoes
Dancing shoes ooh
