Shadow forces, back to the front
Walks like the Prince, the Saiyan's stomp
Rage is on, anger is a gift
Breakdown weapon to kill you with one riff
Step by step we move forward
Tenshimato technique, unbreakable gard
Hard is the mission but I trust my faction
Mystical ambition needs lyrical possession

BOOM
Watch your back the dope boys are back
BOOM
Dark mentor the Knight of the night
BOOM
Five soldiers still dressed in black
BOOM
One Emperor, undefeated might

Lurks in my shadow, hate waits its time
Like Gaara and his mother, untouchable rhyme
Crime after crime he consumes my soul
Day after day I lost the control
I try to react, fight back kick back
He tries to confront, attacks by night
Worst is coming, reality's ghost
This is the cost when you become the host
Humanity's lost, birth of the beast
At last the dark demon will be unleashed
Fist in the air, the story is on
Weapon of destruction, I don't come alone

BOOM
Watch your back the dope boys are back
BOOM
Dark mentor the Knight of the night
BOOM
Five soldiers still dressed in black
BOOM
One Emperor, undefeated might

Attaque contre-attaque matraquage compact
Intacte est l'éthique, épique est l'équipe
Attaque contre-attaque matraquage compact
Intacte est l'éthique, épique est l'équipe Go

BOOM-BOOM
Watch your back the dope boys are back
BOOM-BOOM
Dark mentor the Knight of the night
BOOM-BOOM
Five soldiers still dressed in black
BOOM-BOOM
One Emperor, undefeated might
