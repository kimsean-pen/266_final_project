What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been running and hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling, please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down

Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling, please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please, don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain

Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling, please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling, please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
