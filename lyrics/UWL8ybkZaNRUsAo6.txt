Denied son cast out the paradise
Accused for the act of killing in defiance
Fallen shadow of the assassin's blade
Honor and glory for the sins of the brave

Inherit the curse of divine ways
Crimes of perdition and mortal revenge
Reveal the sorrow of the lamb's lamentation
Violate the sacrilege of heaven's infestation

Angel of assassins and pagan kings
Lead the mortal man into immortality
The glory of a broken sword in the battlefield
The forged steel made for the kill

Incite the hate of the beast of prey
Slay the prophets, promises of disdain
Incite the hate of the beast of prey
Slay the prophets, promises of disdain

Denied son cast out the paradise
Accused for the act of killing in defiance
Fallen shadow of the assassin's blade
Honor and glory for the sins of the brave

Inherit the curse of divine ways
Crimes of perdition and mortal revenge

Blow the doomed winds of earthly sins
Cast the fallen souls into the abyss
In sacrificial perpetual penitence
With a profane mortal embrace

Sworn to the sign of Cain - Saint of assassins and thieves
Brand the mark of slain - Rebellious entity of pagan kings
