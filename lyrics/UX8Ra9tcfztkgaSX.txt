Every night I grab some money and I go down to the bar
I got my buddies and a beer I got a dream - I need a car
You got me begging on my knees c'mon and throw the dog a bone
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone

Baby baby
Rock 'n roll and brew
Rock 'n roll and brew
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you
Rock 'n roll and brew
Rock 'n roll and brew
I know that you and I oh we got better things to do
I don't know who you are or what you do
Or where you go when you're not around
I don't know anything about you baby
But you're everything I'm dreaming of
I don't know who you are
But you're a real dead ringer for love
A real dead ringer for love

(Cher:) Ever since I can remember you been hanging around this joint
You been trying to look away but now you finally got the point
I don't have to know your name and I won't tell you what to do
But a girl - she doesn't live by only rock 'n roll and brew
Baby baby, baby baby
(Both:) Rock n' roll and brew
Rock 'n roll and brew
(Meat:) They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you
(Both:) Rock n' roll and brew
Rock 'n roll and brew
(Meat:) I know that you and I oh we got better things to do
I don't know who you are or what you do
Or where you go when you're not around
(Cher:) I don't know anything about you baby
But you're everything I'm dreaming of
I don't know who you are
(Meat:) But you're a real dead ringer for love
a real dead ringer for love

(Meat:) Oh! You got the kind of legs that do more than walk
(Cher:) I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk
(Meat:) Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see
(Cher:) You got a lotta nerve to come on to me
(Meat:) You got the kind of lips that do more than drink
(Cher:) You got the kind of mind that does less than think
But since I'm feeling kinda lonely n' my defenses are low
Why don't we give it a shot and get it ready to go
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction
I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action

(Cher:) Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint
My daddy never noticed now he'll finally get the point
(Meat:) You got me beggin' on my knees
C'mon and throw the dog a bone
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone
(Both:) Baby baby, baby baby
Rock 'n roll and brew
Rock 'n roll and brew
I know that you and I oh we got better things to do
Rock 'n roll and brew
Rock 'n roll and brew
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you
(Cher:) I don't know who you are
(Meat:) Oh what you do
(Cher:) Or where you go
(Meat:) When you're not around
(Cher:) I don't know anything about you baby
(Meat:) But you're everything I'm dreaming of
(Both:) I don't know who you are
But you're a real dead ringer for love
A real dead ringer for love

Dead ringer for love
Dead ringer for love - dead ringer (x12)
