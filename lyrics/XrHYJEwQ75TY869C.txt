Is it all just a beautiful nightmare? Am I nothing more?
Will I sink the bottom of nowhere or arrive ashore?
Holding on is a question unanswered, one I can't ignore
Is it all just a beautiful nightmare? Am I nothing more?

Show me how it ends, will I still be scared to live
Show me how it ends, for us, for us, for us

Is it also a beautiful nightmare, on the other side?
Will I send my breath to a lost prayer? Will it change my mind?
Should I follow a chorus of voices, or a gentle voice?
It it also a beautiful nightmare, on the other side?

Show me how it ends, will I still be scared to live
Show me how it ends, in the ground, or in the clouds
Is there anywhere? Can she find me there?
Show me how it ends, for us, for us, for us

Say goodnight, tired eyes
Say goodnight, one last time

Show me how it ends, will I still be scared to live
Show me how it ends, in the ground, or in the clouds
Is there anywhere? Can she find me there?
Show me how it ends, for us, for us, for us
