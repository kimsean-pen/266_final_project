You have let them
Arch your back and
Swallowed the toxicity
Hold your own, don't wait and see

You've let them make
You feel bad about
Every little thing you've done
Judge of all things
Maker of none

Just kill them with kindness

'Cause you will always be
Much too strong
For someone else
You will always be
Much too tall
For someone else
Don't try you to apologise
Black star
That's what you are
No one stills the fire in your heart
Fire with fire now
Fire with fire now
Fire with fire now

You allowed it, you condoned it
You are holding all the cards
All you need is some simple words now
"No" is a good one, "hell no" is better
Open doors by shutting one
It seems impossible until it's done now

Just kill them with kindness

'Cause you will always be
Much too strong
For someone else
You will always be
Much too tall
For someone else
Don't you try to apologize
Black star
That's what you are
No one stills the fire in your heart
Fire with fire now

Fire with fire now
Fire with me now
Just kill them with kindness

Strong for someone else, strong for someone

Strong for someone else
You will always be
Much too tall
For someone else
Don't you try to apologize
Black star
That's what you are
No one stills the fire in your heart
Fire with fire now
