I sail the seas of negativity
To banish evil from this place
I fight with sword of fire and lightning
I am the guardian come this day

I will never put my sword down
I will never run away
In The Veils of Negative Existence
I am the master here to stay

My crystal shield will never fail me
It can withstand the devils rain
And with the Lords of Light to guide me
I bring forth vengeance in their name

I will never put my sword down
I will never run away
In The Veils of Negative Existence
I know it's not my mind at play

Upon the Island of Damnation
The Horde of Hades screams and wails
The blood of life and execution
Has put back light into the Veils

I will never put my sword down
I will never run away
In The Veils of Negative Existence
I am the master here to stay

Inside of the darkness
Between the planes
A tesseract dimension
Few know its name
On Prydwen, my longship
Of silver sails
Excalibur at my side
We shall not fail
