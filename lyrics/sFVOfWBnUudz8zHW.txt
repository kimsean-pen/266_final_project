My wheels are turning
Yeah my mind is spinning like a hurricane
You know she's worth it
Ever since she touched me I ain't been the same
No, baby

Just a little, give me just a little
Alright, alright
Come on baby make it sizzle

She's my bad, bad, bad
Bad habit
I got a bad, bad, bad
Bad habit

Oh, come on

I'm coming baby
Yeah I'm coming baby like a freight train
Call me crazy
You know I can't help but wanna feel the pain babe

She makes me miss her flowing like a river
Alright, alright
Come on baby make me shiver

She's my bad, bad, bad
Bad habit
I got a bad, bad, bad
Bad habit

Oh, yeah!

She's my bad, bad, bad
Bad habit
I got a bad, bad, bad
Bad habit
