No more gold lights
For the queen earth
To keep you warm
In your kingdoms
High on the waves
You make for us
But not since you left
Have the waves come

The bar is dead
And the rocket's rain
Is keeping you wet
In your deathbed
So high on the waves
You made for us
And not since you left
Have the waves come

High on the waves you made for us
Not since you left have the waves come
