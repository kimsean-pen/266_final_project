Sang a lullaby to a butterfly
Child's wide brown eyes, secrets inside
She said, When I die, become a butterfly
You can flutter and colour in meadows and hills
Beauty gave me the chills
Flying on your own, then a thousand mourn
Thousand souls swarming, thousands were performing

Bright white, emerald green
Silk blue, sailing seas
And the spotted wings
Go, go blow in the wind

Bright white, emerald green
Silk blue, sailing seas
And the spotted wing
Go, go blow in the wind
Go, go, go, go blow in the wind

In their old house, from a lover's mouth
He kept feathered in behind the bamboo screen
She said, When he died, became a butterfly
He was fluttering, colouring meadows and hills
Beauty gave us the chills
Flying on your own, then a thousand mourn
Thousand souls swarming, thousands were performing
Thousand souls swarming, thousands were performing

Bright white, emerald green
Silk blue, sailing seas
And the spotted wings
Go, go blow in the wind

Bright white, emerald green
Silk blue, sailing seas
And the spotted wing
Go, go blow in the wind
Go, go
