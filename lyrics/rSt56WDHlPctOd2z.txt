Stop that train: I'm leavin' - today
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - anyway!
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - and i said:
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

All my good live I've been a lonely man
Teaching people who don't understand;
And even though I"ve tried my best
I still don't find no happiness

So I got to say:
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - oh, baby now!
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - don't care what you say!
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - and Isaid:
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
Said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Some goin' east; and a ome goin' west
Some step aside to try their best
Some livin' big, but the msot livin' small
They just can't even find no food at all

I mean, stop it:
Stop that train: I'm leavin'- leavin', mm-hmm
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - I don't mind!
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - and i said:
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong:
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;

Stop that train: I'm leavin' - leavin'!
Stop that train I'm leavin' - leavin' - can't take it!
Stop that train I'm leavin' - got to be better!
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
Said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Stop that train I'm leaving...
