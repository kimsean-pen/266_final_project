Underneath our feet,
crystals grow like plants.
(listen, how they grow)
I m blinded by the light
(listen, how they glow)
in the core of the Earth.
(listen, how they grow)

Crystalline
internal nebula
(crystalline)
rocks growing slowmo
(crystalline)
i conquer claustrophobia
(crystalline)
and demand the light

We mimic the openness
of the ones we love,
dovetail our generosity
equalize the flow

With our hearts
we chisel quartz
to reach love.

Crystalline [ ]

Octagon, polygon,
pipes of an organ,
sonic branches,
murmuring drone.

Crystallizing galaxies
spread out like my fingers.

Crystalline [ ]

Listen, how they grow,
listen, how they glow,
listen, how they grow,
listen, how they glow.

It s the sparkle you become
when you conquer anxiety.
Sparkle you become,
conquer anxiety

It s the sparkle you become
when you conquer anxiety.
It s the sparkle you become
when you conquer anxiety.
