Oh Lisa, lift up your head, light up a cigarette
In the morning light you're not so hot.
Oh Lisa, come talk to me, I wanna hear your memories,
You know I thought of you from time to time.

Lying with your make-up off
I can see the girl I love
Dark (?)

And I think still after all these years
Oh, I think still after all these years
Something still burns.

Oh, Lisa, don't be shy, this is not real life
This moment will soon be lost in time.
When it's time to leave don't turn your back on me
This was no return, our grand farewell.

Mostly I won't think of you,
But baby if I ever do
I remember thinking with surprise.

That still after all these years
Still after all these years
Something still burns.

Lying with your make-up off
I can see the girl I love
Dark (?)

And I think still after all these years
Oh, still something in me
Still after all these years,
Something still burns.
