They don't wanna hear me shout
Took a pill for my doubts
Breathe in, breathe out
Nothing in my eyes so I smile with my mouth

Ooo, she's insecure
But she's got money in her pores
Ooo, never find a cure
Why should we pretend anymore?

Champagne in my veins
Bleach soaking into my brain
The city's making me crazy
But they say pretty is pain
Gold chains and blood stains
Good girls cover their shame
It's really making me crazy
But they say pretty is pain

If I took another shot
Would you tell me that I'm hot?
I'm lookin at myself over my shoulder
Will anybody love me when I'm older?

Ooo, she's insecure
But she's got money in her pores
Ooo, we'll never find a cure
Why should we pretend anymore?

Champagne in my veins
Bleach soaking into my brain
The city's making me crazy
But they say pretty is pain
Gold chains and blood stains
Good girls cover their shame
It's really making me crazy
But they say pretty is pain

Am I pretty?
Feel so shitty
Am I pretty?
I feel so dirty

Ooo, she's insecure
But she's got money in her pores
Ooo, we'll never find a cure
Why should we pretend anymore?

Champagne in my veins
Bleach soaking into my brain
The city's making me crazy
But they say pretty is pain
Gold chains and blood stains
Good girls cover their shame
It's really making me crazy
But they say pretty is pain

Am I pretty?
Feel so shitty
Am I pretty?
I feel so dirty

Champagne in my veins
Bleach soaking into my brain
The city's making me crazy
But they say pretty is pain
