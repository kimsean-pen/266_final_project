I fall at the thought
Of us falling apart
But I swore never to use my head
Before I use my heart
And then you'll keep me breathing
Grant me peace through the night
My dear, I hope your dreams are sweet as real life

Cause this is my favourite thing by far
And you define everything I've ever known
But why

Do you believe in fate?
Do you believe in destiny?
Would you believe me if I told you "you complete me"?

I don't say this lightly
So don't take this lightly

This is my favourite thing by far
And you define everything I've ever known
But why, why me?
When you could have had anybody
Hi, nice to meet you
Was it nice to meet me too?

Don't tell me the things
That you think I want to hear
Just tell me the truth
And the whole truth
Your thoughts and your hopes
And your dreams and your fears
Cause I don't have time to waste
If all that you're looking for is to chase
Don't let me be just another mistake
But still it's a chance that I'm willing to take for you
For you
It's all for you

This is my favourite thing by far
And you define everything I've ever known
But why, why me?
When you could have had anybody
Hi, nice to meet you
Was it nice to meet me too?

This is my favourite thing by far
And you define everything I've ever known
But why, why me?
When you could have had anybody
Hi, nice to meet you
Was it nice to meet me too?
