I said, my,
My slow descent
Into alcoholism, it went
To my head, where I really need it
With abuse that remained untreated

I said, my, my, my, my slow descent
Into alcoholism, it went
Something like this song...
Something like this song...
Something like this song...

Salvation holdout central...
Salvation holdout central...
Salvation holdout central...

I said, my ever-loosening grip
On the commonest courtesies slipped
From my hands, where I really need her
When I need change for the parking meters

I said, my, my, my, my slow descent
Into alcoholism, it went
Something like this song...
Something like this song...
Something like this song...

Salvation holdout central... (x16)
