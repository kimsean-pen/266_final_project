I made promises that I can't keep
I fell asleep
I was the one who locked the door
I lost the key
Told me lies straight to my face
But I guess that's fate

I said "everything is fine with me"
I lied through my teeth
I lost all of my self respect
It's such a wreck
I'm running out of air to breathe
Think it's time for me to...
Leave my friends all behind
Watch me hurt, or are you blind?
I think it's sad you'll never know
My true feelings will never show

I made promises that I can't keep
I fell asleep
I was the one who locked the door
I lost the key
Told me lies straight to my face
But I guess that's fate

I'll be you and you'll be me
I'll be you and you'll be me
My secret society

I'll be you and you'll be me
I'll be you and you'll be me
My secret society
