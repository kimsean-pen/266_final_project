Another Story
Of girl meets boy
And gets destroyed
Another promise
Broken in two
The lucky view of fiction
Fade away
Fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story
Of girl meets boy
He's okay she's broken
He's the ocean waves
She's choking
Fade away
Fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story
Of girl meets boy
So picture perfect
It can't be real
And all you feel in Numb
You see them talking
But hear no sound
To hit the ground
He's okay she's broken
He's the ocean waves
She's choking
Don't want it
Don't need it
Don't want it
