He been away, you hung around
Botherin' me every night
When I wouldn't go out with you
You said things that weren't very nice.
My boyfriend's back and youre's gonna be in trouble
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
When you see him comin' better cut out on the double
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
You been spreadin' lies that I was untrue
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
So look out now cause he's comin' after you
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
(And he knows that you've been tryin')
(And he knows that you've been lyin')
He's been gone for such a long time
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
But now he's back and things will be fine
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
You're gonna be sorry you were ever born
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
Cause he's kinda big and he's awful strong
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
(And he knows about your cheatin')
(And yo're gonna get a beatin')
What makes you think he'd believe all your lies, wahoo... wahoo...
You're a big man now, wanna cut you down to size, wahoo... wahoo...
Wait and see!
My boyfriend's back, he's gonna save my reputation
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
If I were you I'd take a permanent vacation
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
(La-de-la, my boyfriend's back) Here he comes
(La-de-la, my boyfriend's back) Yeah my boyfriend's back
(La-de-la, my boyfriend's back) Look out now
(La-de-la, my boyfriend's back) My boyfriend's back
(La-de-la, my boyfriend's back) Here he comes now
