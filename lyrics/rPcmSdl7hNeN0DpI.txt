Serotonin stole the moment
The best of me was left under the bedsheets
On that somber morning
Dying for some REM
My mind is always troubled with
Where have I been and where am I going

When my head comes crashing down
They're all waiting at the bottom
Tryna claw me down beneath it all
Every night I beg that sound
It's the greatest revelation
It's the only thing that keeps me grounded

I need to hear that sound
I need to hear that

Loaded vampires butter me up
Drop names and sniff up residue
While boasting about their revenue
At home I face these green eyed beasts
Everybody wants to leave but no one wants to see you do it

When my head comes crashing down
They're all waiting at the bottom
Tryna claw me down beneath it all
Every night I beg that sound
It's the greatest revelation
It's the only thing that keeps me grounded

I need to hear that sound
I need to hear that

When my head comes crashing down
They're all waiting at the bottom
Tryna claw me down beneath it all
Every night I beg that sound
It's the greatest revelation
It's the only thing that keeps me grounded

I need to hear that sound
I need to hear that sound
