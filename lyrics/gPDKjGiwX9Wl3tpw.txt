Shattered dreams surround me
Searching in a haze, invisible
Mostly stories, fictional
Lost in the craze

I've been waiting for you in the night
That's the only place I know
You can be found
This never ending
Constant descending chase for you
How can I survive the aftermath

Never ending chaos
Looking for a sign, Intoxicate
What truth is left, dissipate
Descend off line

I've been waiting for you in the night
That's the only place I know
You can be found
This never ending
Constant descending chase for you
How can I survive the aftermath

Take me back
Take me back
Take me to the Wasteland
Take me back
Take me back
Take me to the Wasteland
Take me back
Take me back
Take me to the Wasteland
Take me back
Take me back
Take me to the Wasteland

This never ending
Constant descending chase for you
This never ending
Constant descending chase for you
Chase for you
