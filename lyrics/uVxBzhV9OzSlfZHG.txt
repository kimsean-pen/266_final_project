ohh.
Put it in a coffin
I never should have done it
and now I feel so wasted
too broken to erase it
and I couldn't help it
chalk it up to precision
I wish I never loved you2x
ohhh oh
and you got me where you wanted
I wrote it out
I'm not going back to where we started
try and stop me2x
ohoh.
and now I'm in the city
after all the running
you were never scared of nothing
but I wish you told me something
caught and faded
you told me you'd be waiting
you wonder why I'm lonely2x
yeahh...
and you got me where you wanted
I wrote it out
I'm not going back to where we started
try and stop me
I hope you stop me
caught me when I'm fade
told you I'd be waiting
this time I won't be leaving
you can take back your promises
you caught me when I'm fading
you told me you'd be waiting
and you wonder why I'm lonely 2x
and you got me where you wanted
I wrote it out
I'm not going back to where we started
try and stop me
I hope you stop me
I hope you stop me
