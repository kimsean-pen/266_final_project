You almost had me there
it was the batting lashes that gave you away
your're bold beyond repair
and there's and absense today, of defiance
a most awaken inclination
and your elegant abberation...

Something's happening!
and all the rebels and devils have come to naught
to hear your sirening
and who would un ring, oh, your bell?

Defiance, a most awaken inclination
defiance, your elegant abberation...
