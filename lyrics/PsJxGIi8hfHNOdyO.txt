You know there's no place like planet home
Nowhere else I would rather be
It's the only place I know
Where you can witness tragedy
There's no time to wonder now
About who is right or wrong
Were Gonna need some help to get things straight
So come on bring your advice along,
Because sure enough

There's no place like planet home
I wanna go now
This blue sphere of talented dreams
Is heading for destruction
Illusions drip from every seam
It's just death by corruption
I heard there was a promised land
On planet home
2000 years they've been and gone
But still we don't know

Can't you see, there's no place like planet home
I wanna go now
If only we can make it right
Planet home I've got to go now
I wanna go there baby
Find yourself some peace on planet home
I've got to go now
Anything's in reach on planet home
Planet home, planet home.

Planet home is blue and green
Beautiful for you to see (x3)

Planet is blue and green

I wanna go now (x2)

Planet home I wanna go there, planet home
There's no place like planet home,
I wanna go now
If only we can make it right, planet home
I wanna go now- hey I really wanna go now
Find yourself some peace on planet home
I wanna go now- I wanna go there baby
Anythings in reach on planet home.
