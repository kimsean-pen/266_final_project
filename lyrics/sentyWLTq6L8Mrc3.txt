I've got huge love
Afternoon love with the queen of school
(Not a little schoolboy's love)
Main attraction in the classroom
Students want her, teachers too
But she sat right up next to me

She said "Shane, boy, be my toy
My pussy, your employer
(Not my b-boyfriend)
Just a little in and out
Shane, I want to scream and shout"
Oh, she was good to me

The magic of Daisy was she made you feel
Like it wasn't real
Like your wounds were all healed
I know that it happened and it doesn't even matter
If you think that I'm lying then you haven't seen
What she's done to me
How I'm finally free
Oh, she was looking at me
Oh, what she's done to me

The queen of my school, oh yeah
The queen of my school

We made rude love
It was screwed up but I don't mind
(Really don't mind at all)
Main attraction in the bedroom
If someone saw they'd be confused
'Cause she was not ordinary
My mistake was when I thought of getting close to her
(Breaking my heart apart)
"Oh no, Shane, it's not like that
You're a mouse, I'm a cat"
I cried myself to sleep

The magic of Daisy was she made you feel
Like it wasn't real
Like your wounds were all healed
I know that it happened and it doesn't even matter
If you think that I'm lying then you haven't seen
What she's done to me
How I'm finally free
Oh, she was looking at me
Oh, what she's done to me

The queen of my school, oh yeah
The queen of my school

What she's done to me
