And on my mind, and on my mind,
Under these eyes, under these eyes,
I feel this body shaking, I'm about to let you go

Over and over, over and over, over and over, over again.

And now, all of these voices,
All of these voices, I don't hear like i used to.
We're gonna lose ourselves tonight,
We're gonna burn this fire right,
We're gonna feel so high,
We're gonna lose ourselves,
Over and over again.
