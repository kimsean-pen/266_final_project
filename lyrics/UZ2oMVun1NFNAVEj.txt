Disentanglement from flesh's captivity
Freedom's lair, soon, I will reach
Unlock the ultimate gate to perpetuity
Mortal's lair, soon, I will leave

Disembodiement from tangibility
Immortal, soon, I will be
Fearless, I cross the gate to pure eternity
Blinding light, soon, I will see

Lucid pain
Brings the gift
From this earth
I shall drift

Tied ...facing the archers
Pierced ...bleed with rapture

Rise ...towards slendors
Feel ...divine grandeurs

Disentanglement from flesh's captivity
Freedom's lair, soon, I will reach
Unlock the ultimate gate to perpetuity
Mortal's lair, soon, I will leave

Tied ...facing the archers
Pierced ...bleed with rapture
