It's mid-July and I've been dry
Alone to Southern France
Where up so high, the air is thin
And I can see the end

And everything's been done
But not by you and me
[?] to a dark bar in this comedy

As I'm mounting the [?]
I'm just another tourist folks
With nowhere else to be

And everything's been done
But not by you and me
[?] to a dark bar in this comedy

Oh, everything's been done
But not by you and me
[?] to a dark bar in this comedy
