Felt like the stars fell down before us
In a dream of you and me
then a storm came outta nowhere
Turned my peace to misery.

'Cause i been runnin' now for days
Pickin' up the pieces of love
I'm not so sure it'll go my way
that's just the price of love.
I am oh so tired of loneliness
But the world don't change
and I can't have you, you've gone away
You were the reason, you are the reason I stay.

This fairy tale that you painted for me
You only see what you wanna see
But i'm inclined to tell you somethin'
you never show me how you cared for me.

'Cause i been runnin' now for days
Pickin' up the pieces of love
I'm not so sure it'll go my way
that's just the price of love.
I am oh so tired of loneliness
But the world don't change
and I can't have you, you've gone away
You were the reason, you are the reason I stay.

I stay
The reason i stay

Oh Oh Oh Oh.
