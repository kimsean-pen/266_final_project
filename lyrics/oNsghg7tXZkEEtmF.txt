Violent hands
Come at midnight
Hold me down
I can't make a sound
In their arms
Still unwanted
Crave the child
Be forever wiled
Stranger, danger
Release me
Mercy's hiding
It let me go, hurts to know
Mercy's watching
Watching me drowning
In rivers of lust
Morning sun
Break the shelter
Turn back time
Wash away my crime
Betrayer, slayer
Release me
Mercy's hiding
It let me go, hurts to know
Mercy's watching
Watching me drowning
In rivers of lust
Mercy's hiding
It let me go, hurts to know
Mercy's watching
Watching me drowning
Mercy's hiding
It let me go, hurts to know
Mercy's watching
Watching me drowning
In rivers of lust
Found at noon
Clutching still the stone
