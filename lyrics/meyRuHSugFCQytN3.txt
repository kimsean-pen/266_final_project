Who wants to live and die tonight?
Who wants to see the other side?
Last stance with the Christos
Like a vermin running through your veins
You've gone insane
You've gone insane

Who wants to live and die tonight?
Each one of you wants to lose a life
Last stance with the Christos
Like a vermin running through your veins
You've gone insane
You've gone insane

One last time tonight
Met me in the light
Like diamonds in your eyes
Holy Christos in your mind

One more day to go
Heartbeat's so fast when you dance slow
And now you go
And can let go
You've lost control
