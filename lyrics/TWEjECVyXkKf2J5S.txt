I'm just a normal guy
Missing my normal friends
This ain't no alibi
I hope you understand

I'm not doing this for fame
I'm not doing this for fun
I've grown addicted to
A life I never chose

I'm searching for the path where light pours in
And I'll move mountains if I have to
I hope along the way I'll help you, dear
So hold on tight, it's gonna be a long ride

I've been the MVP
Tagged as the Don Juan
Labeled as prodigy
Brother, it weighs a ton

So let's put a smile on this face
What the world needs is our grace
Why don't we help ourselves
And store old ghosts on the shelves?

We'll keep on marching to the sunlight
We'll keep on drifting to that white light
