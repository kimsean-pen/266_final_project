Cover me with shades of disbelief
Can happiness be someone else's dream
Numbers call to spell my name
Move about as values change
Catch me if you can
But don't delay

Today, today
It's a dream away

Governed by the title on the wall
Commit me to a life within a fool
Happiness can often bleed
Beggars lay among the sheep
Let me take the choice
The sermon pleads

Today, today
It's a dream away

Visions in my cell begin to bread
Was everything a fact of what I read
Excuse my while l spell my name
Boat and ship could sound the same
Catch me if you can
But don't delay

Today, today
It's a dream away

Belle Malissima

Today, today
It's a dream away
