Listen
I should have told you long ago

That you glisten
oh more than he will ever know

If he can't see what I have always seen
then something isn't right

He hasn't seen at all
that you are beautiful

I'm breaking down the wall
you're a star

But now I'm about to fall
because you are
cause you are
beautiful beautiful babe

I'll take you higher
than a star could ever go

Let's make fire
oh now your heart begins to glow

Maybe I'm just dreaming
that you let me be your
constellation prize

He hasn't seen at all
that you are beautiful

I'm breaking down the wall
you're a star

But now I'm about to fall
beacause you are
cause you are
beautiful beautiful babe

He hasn't seen at all
that you are beautiful

I'm breaking down the wall
you're a star

But now I'm about to fall
because you are
cause you are
beautiful beautiful babe ooooh
Hey your constellation prize
Aaa yeah

He hasn't seen at all

Hey

Cause you are
