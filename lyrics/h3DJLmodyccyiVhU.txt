I was born in the desert
I've been down for years
Jesus, come closer
I think my time is near
And I've traveled over
Dry earth and floods
Hell and high water to bring you my love

Climbed over mountains
Traveled the sea
Cast down on heaven
Cast down on my knee
I've laid with the devil
Cursed God above
Forsaken heaven to bring you my love

To bring you my love
To bring you my love
To bring you my love

I know he's gonna be here
You know he's gonna be here
Yeah alright
Forsaken heaven
Cursed God above
Laid with the devil
Bring you my love

To bring you my love
To bring you my love
To bring you my love
