I walked away*
From everyone I know
I looked around and thought
This must be what it's like to be alone
When it's bet on me
I want to grow old
I bend my will
I (?)
End up big time (?)
Oh how to be brave
You've got to be brave
Oh how to be brave
You've got to be brave
Oh how to be brave
You've got to be brave
Look's like no choice to me
Oh how to be brave
You've got to be brave
Oh how to be brave
You've got to be brave
Oh how to be brave
You've got to be brave
Look's like no choice to me
Oh how to be brave
You've got to be brave
Oh how to be brave
You've got to be brave
Oh how to be brave
You've got to be brave
Look's like no choice to me
I walked away
From everyone I know
I looked around and thought
This must be what it's like to be alone
Oh how to be brave
You've got to be brave
Oh how to be brave
You've got to be brave
Oh how to be brave
You've got to be brave
Look's like no choice to me
