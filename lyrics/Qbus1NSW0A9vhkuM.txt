Morning brings the sunrise
To the mountain of the Dane
In the over lying distance
The dealer deals the pain
In the land of forgotten lifetimes
An angel guards the time
Memories won't fail me
And vengence will be mine
I move slowly through the darkness
Lookin' for the light

In a vision I was taken
By the wizard's deadly game
Reaching for the boundries
Held here by the chains
Vanguard of the darkness
Black Riders in the night
Shadows now surround me
A victim of their flight
I move slowly through the darkness
Looking for the light

As the moonlight over takes me
I walk on through the night
Vengence still evades me
As the Dark Lord holds the Nine
Time now passing quickly
Dark victory is near
A hero's badly needed
With courage free of fear
He moves slowly through the darkness
Looking for the light
