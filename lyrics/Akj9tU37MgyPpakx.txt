I know it's not a game to play
your eyes they show no fear
I bum inside and can not wait to be

The man that feels your body close
is here to set you free
to hold you near and satisfy your needs

You shiver as I touch your neck
slowly close your eyes
I cant resist you even if I try

We both surrender to the touch
as we lay there side by side
and everything around us disappears

lf you believe in love tonight
I'm gonna show you one more time
lf you believe then let it out
No need to worry there's no doubt

lf you believe, if you believe
lf you believe then let it out

As you run your fingers through my hair
Your lips come close to mine
The tension becomes more than I can bare

Then you wrap your arms around me
and I feel your every move
This feeling could now lead us anywhere

Now we leave the world behind us
this moment we both share
Just you and me that's how it's meant to be

I never wanted you so much
I feel your every breath
As you gently whisper in my ear

lf you believe in love tonight
I'm gonna show you one more time
lf you believe then let it out
No need to worry there's no doubt
lf you believe, if you believe
If you believe then let it out

lf you believe in love tonight
lf you believe in love tonight
I'm gonna show you one more time

Show you one more time

If you believe then let it out
No need to worry there's no doubt
lf you believe, if you believe
Don't worry
you gotta let it out babe
you gotta let it out babe
