On a course to fight
To cleave a path with a trail of fire
To the heavens we take
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists

The thrill of the kill in the hunters chase
We have exposed the night, from which the feeble flee
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists rise
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists rise

Brandish new force, like a plague it strikes down
The time is now cos the time is right
To take what is ours

Subservient dogs
Crippled by the pack
Crawling in blind honour
Head down to be shot

Feel the new force, like a plague it strikes down
The time is now cos the time is right
To take what is ours

You crawled in the dark
Blind faith broke you down
Face down in submission
Laying down to be shot

This dawn is ours to rise
To cleave a path with a trail of fire
Destruction, force to strike
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists rise
Clenched fists rise!

From the dawn has arisen the hunter
The banishing force, the new world dominator!
