And you don't stop, keep keep it on
Keep it on, keep, keep it on
You don't stop, keep keep it on
(Welcome to the after party)
Keep, keep it on, where da party at

After the party
Let's take a little time
And talk about it
What's going through your mind

And as we're shakin'
Oh, it looks so right
I wanna ride

See I would be lyin'
If I didn't tell you
It made me wanna flip
And you can't tell me
You ain't feelin' the same

Girl it's our chemistry
Like icing on the cake
I hope you stay
So we can do our thang
After the party

Don't stop you ain't gotta stop
(Baby do your thing)
Don't stop if the music drops
(Rock with me)
Get on top, you can take it off
(What's it gonna be)
Doncha want the after party

After the party
Let's go somewhere and finish
What we started
'Cause right from the beginning
I was on it

I know you felt these thighs
You know I felt you rise
So why don't we slide
Up off the dance floor

You and me
'Cause I wanna know
Just how deep
Does your lovin' go
So tell your boys, "Good night"
'Cause we're going right
After the party

Don't stop you ain't gotta stop
(Baby do your thing)
Don't stop if the music drops
(Rock with me)
Get on top, you can take it off
(What's it gonna be)
Doncha want the after party

Don't stop you ain't gotta stop
(Baby do your thing)
Don't stop if the music drops
(Rock with me)
Get on top, you can take it off
(What's it gonna be)
Doncha want the after party

Sweet baby come with me
'Cause I wanna do you right
Don't hold back, baby where you at
'Cause I wanna get inside

Don't stop you ain't gotta stop
(Baby do your thing)
Don't stop if the music drops
(Rock with me)
Get on top, you can take it off
(What's it gonna be)
Doncha want the after party

Don't stop you ain't gotta stop
(Baby do your thing)
Don't stop if the music drops
(Rock with me)
Get on top, you can take it off
(What's it gonna be)
Doncha want the after party

Don't stop you ain't gotta stop
Don't stop, rock with me
What's it gonna be
