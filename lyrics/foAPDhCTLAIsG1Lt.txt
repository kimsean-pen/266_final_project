And you're tired of your mum
And you're tired of your dad
Got you jumping through hoops
Got you shaving your legs
Let it pass, let it pass, let it pass
Over to you

And you're tired of your face
And you're tired of your nose
Got you jumping through hoops
Got you shaving your legs
Let it pass, let it pass, let it pass
Through to you

And your nose is bleeding
And your nose is bleeding
You've been lying to me

There will be no hesitation
There will be no confrontation
There will be no indication
There will be no applause
There will be no exultation
There will be no justification
There will be no way at all

And your nose is bleeding
And your nose is bleeding
You've been lying to me

Come back to me the the way you were
The way you were when we were young
I'm trying to tell you everything
I'm trying to tell you everything

I can heal the blind
I can cure the sick
I can heal the blind
I can cure the sick
I can say the right things
I can say the right things

Where'd you get so cruel?
Where'd you get so cruel?
Where'd you get so cruel?
Where'd you get so cruel?
Where do you go?
'Cause you're never here

And your nose is bleeding
And your nose is bleeding
You've been lying to me

Come back to me the the way you were
The way you were when we were young
I'm trying to tell you everything
I'm trying to tell you everything
