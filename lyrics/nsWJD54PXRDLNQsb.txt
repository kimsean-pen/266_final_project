Take off your cloths /dancing naked on the floor
Tastes like a peach / one I've never tried before

How to take it / how to fake it
You're so good

God save the trees / more royal blood aint what we need
To focus on the little things / and everything else can fall in place

How to break it / how to snake it
You're so good

Choke on your lies / you're best suited to follow
Why kiss and tell / it's only guilt you're relieving
How to take it / how to fake it
How to break it / how to snake it
You're so good
