See myself in a screen
Wasting days, counting weeks
Getting more familiar with how you speak
While you're away from me

But i don't want to say goodbye
Because it's safer when i'm by your side
It's safer when i'm by your side
I want to be near you
Like i'm meant to
I'm meant to

But hey
I think it's going to be alright
When we're sleeping and i'm by your side
I want to learn to fly
But it's safer when i stay inside
It's safer when i stay inside
I want you
But the monster
Won't let me
Escape here
