Come all of you poor workers, good news to you I'll tell.
Of how that good old union has come in here to dwell.
Which side are you on?
Which side are you on?
Which side are you on?
Which side are you on?
We are starting our good battle we know we're sure to win because we got the gun thugs looking pretty thin.
They say in Harlan County. There are no neutrals there.
You'll either be a union man, or a thug for J.H. Blair.
Oh, workers can you stand it?
Oh, tell me how you can.
Will you be a lousy scab, or will you be a man?
(oh death, oh death, please spare me over for another year)
My daddy was a miner he's now in the air and sun
he'll be with you fellow workers till every battle's won.
