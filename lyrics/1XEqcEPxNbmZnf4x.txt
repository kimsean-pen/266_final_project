like warmth in the winter
and lazing around
we'll see another winter
...when the scenes fall
alone in the city
with the rain pouring down
lost summer rain
I wonder who he is
and want him around
lost summer
a kiss in the window
we see her
a pale memory shows
it's time to let go
of a hateful season
lost summer rain
I want her
how she is
to keep her awake
lost summer
...with wind to the lovers
the seas fall
their love is to each other
it completes awe
give thanks to the season
as the weeks fall
no rhyme nor reasons
it's time to let go
