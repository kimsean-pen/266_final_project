i'm the kokopelli in the cave, when i'm in the mood i like to play.
bend a couple rules and misbehave, welcome to my twisted cabaret.
where music touches me, when you're choosing, keep shuffling because tune age beats suffering.
cause music touches me, when you choose it, keep shuffling but don't lose it.
