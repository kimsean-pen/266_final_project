Never been so proud of myself
Looking out for me for once putting me before someone else
A selfish love has been my experience
On the unfortunate side of a love that just takes and never gives

But oh, oh no more feeling sorry for myself
'Cause I know my worth
And oh oh I will no longer settle for whatever
'Cause I know I deserve heaven & earth, yeah

Finally realized that you just don't know, no
You're not capable of loving me like you should
And you wont be until you grow
And losing me is proof that you reap that what you sew

So, no more feeling sorry for myself
'Cause I know my worth
And oh oh I, will no longer settle for whatever
'Cause I know I deserve heaven and earth
Yeah, for all that its worth
Oh, heaven and earth woohooo

No I, no more feeling sorry for myself
'Cause I know my worth
And oh oh I, will no longer settle for whatever
'Cause I know I deserve heaven and earth
I know that I, I know that I, deserve heaven and earth
I know that I, I know that I, deserve heaven and earth
