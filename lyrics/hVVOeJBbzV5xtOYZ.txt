Over before it began.
Some of them we're friends I guess and others I guess they were fans.
Some of them were strangers, some of the were part of the plan.
They were all the same, they were over before, before they began.

Closer. As close as you can.
Closer than the clothes you were wearing, closer than we understand.
Closer than a cousin, closer than a woman and man.
Closer than the closest thing but still over before it began.

Some of them were strangers, some of the were part of the plan.
They were all the same, they were over before, before they began.

Over before it began.

Even though I have always loved you it was over before it began.
Even though I have always loved you it was over before it began.
Even though I have always loved you it was over before it began.
