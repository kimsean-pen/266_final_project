Don't have to be in low light,
everywhere you go, we're always in the know oh, oh
Every time I turn, you're smoking on that blue cigar, blue cigar
Don't hace to say goodnight, anywhere we are,
we're always in the road, every time I call,
you're driving in you're black fast car, black fast car
To the things that were said, Jane's turning blue,
They still dance in her head, To the electric moon.
Caught me dead in a daydream, Every place I go,
ya trancin' in my zone Every time I try, I'm dancin' to a T-rex song,
T-rex song
So sick if the love fights,
Every little word, you're always being heard.
Every time I swear, I'm waiting for the next so long, so long
To the thing that were said, ooh.
Jane's turning blue,
They still dance in her head, To the electric moon.
Don't have to say you're night fright,
Anywhere we go, we're always on the low oh, oh.
Every time I dream.
You are lyin' there Next to me, next to me.
Yo don't have to be in the limelight, Everywhere you are,
I wonder if you're home Every time you are,
Still smoking on that blue cigar, blue cigar
To the thing that were said, ooh.
Jane's turning blue,
They still dance in her head, To the electric moon.
