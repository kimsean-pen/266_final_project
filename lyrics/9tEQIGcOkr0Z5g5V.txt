May I have this danc
It nervously asks.
The two glide into the heavy crowd
Awake this smile
Familiar

The comfort of being
We are everything

Time is irrelevant while you're in my arms, maker
The grid is done and we all slowly collapse around each other.
Piles of flesh and wires create a mountain of memory
