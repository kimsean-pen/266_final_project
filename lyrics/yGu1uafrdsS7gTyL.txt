Anywhere you go, I'll go
Shadows in the camera light
And you don't wanna take it slow, so don't
You know you're my favorite, right?

Hit you with some truth

I can't even lie

You and me got chemistry
Got, got chemistry
Got chemistry
Feel it when you're close to me
And out of reach
And in between

We got la la la, lots of good vibrations
We got la la la, we got la la la
You and me got chemistry
Got, got chemistry
Got chemistry

You and me got, you and me got

You and me got chemistry, got, got chemistry,

Ohh we got chemistry
Feel it when you're close to me
And out of reach

Ohh, we got la, la, la, we got lots of good vibrations
We got la, la, la, we got la, la, la

You and me got chemistry, got, got chemistry,
Got chemistry

Oh, no, oh, yeah
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, yes, we do
Yeah
'Cause you and me got
