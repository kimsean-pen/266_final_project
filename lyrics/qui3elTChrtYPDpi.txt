A new day's born
After a long hard ride
So I'm on my way
To a place called home

But now I'm here
Lost between machines
Watching gray, mute faces
Go on and destroy their lives

Why do you do this, stop it now
'Cause in fact you're innocent
Like a new born child

Why do you do this, stop it now
'Cause in fact you're innocent
Like a new born child

Identity's lost, no need for names
Identity's lost, no need for ideas
Identity's lost, no need for resistance
Identity's lost, no need to be human

Why do you do this, stop it now
'Cause in fact you're innocent
Like a new born child

Why do you do this, stop it now
'Cause in fact you're innocent
Like a new born child

Why do you do this, stop it now
'Cause in fact you're innocent
Like a new born child

Why do you do this, stop it now
'Cause in fact you're innocent
Like a new born child
