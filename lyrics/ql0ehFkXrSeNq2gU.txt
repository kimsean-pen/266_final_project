Makes you feel much older
Sublime the blind parade
It wrecks me how they justify
their acts of war they assemble, they pray

Take good care of what the priests say
After death
it's so much fun'
Little sheep
don't let your feet stray

Happiness is easy

Joy be written on the earth
And the sky above
Jesus star that shines so bright
Gather us in love

Guilt upon their shoulders
How well the cause evades
Infecting your religions,
claiming pacts
It's easy to shoulder the blame

Happiness is easy
Jesus came to Galilee
Happiness is easy
sailing on the sea
Happiness is easy
Jesus came to save our souls
Happiness is easy
and be a friend to me

Try to teach my children
To recognise excuse before it acts
From love and conviction to pray
Take good care of what the priests say
After death
it's so much fun'
Little sheep
don't let your feet stray

Happiness is easy

Jesus came to Galilee
sailing on the sea
Jesus came to save our souls
and be a friend to me
Jesus came to Galilee
sailing on the sea
Jesus came to save our souls
and be a friend to me
Joy be written on the earth
And the sky above
Jesus star that shines so bright
Gather us in love,
Gather us in love
