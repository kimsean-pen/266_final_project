When you're feeling all right everything is up-tight
Try to sing a song that goes ding-ding-a-dong
There will be no sorrow when you sing tomorrow
And you walk along with your ding-ding-dong

Dinge-dong every hour, when you pick a flower
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Dinge-dong, listen to it, maybe it's a big hit
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Sing ding-ding-dong

When you're feeling all right everything is up-tight
Try to sing a song that goes ding-ding-a-dong
And the world looks sunny everyone is funny
When they sing a song that goes ding-ding-dong

Dinge-dong every hour, when you pick a flower
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Dinge-dong, listen to it, maybe it's a big hit
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Sing ding-ding-dong

Ding-dang-dong, dinge-dang-dong
When they think it's all over, they let me down
Dry your tears and forget all your sorrow
Try to smile when you'll say good-bye
Ding-dang-ding-dong, ding-dong-dong
When you wake up tomorrow
Well, the sun is up in the sky
When you're feeling all right everything is up-tight
Try to sing a song that goes ding-ding-a-dong
There will be no sorrow when you sing tomorrow
And you walk along with your ding-ding-dong

Dinge-dong every hour, when you pick a flower
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Dinge-dong, listen to it, maybe it's a big hit
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Sing ding-ding-dong
