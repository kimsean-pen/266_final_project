Are we believing
Black man ray
are we not happy
in our own way
and we the people
who reason why
forever change
as time goes by
Yes, yes, I could be wrong
why, why, should I pretend
God only knows in the end
Are we believing
the heavenly survive
faith the future
big life on their side
and we the people
who can but try
forever learn
as time goes by
Yes, yes, I could be wrong
why, why, should I pretend
God only knows in the end
Are we believing
Black man ray
persuasive danger
in everything you say
and we the people
who answer you why
forever doubt
as time goes by

Yes, yes, I could be wrong
why, why, should I pretend

Yes, yes, I could be wrong
why, why, should I pretend
God only knows in the end
