You don't get nothing for free
Kev & me were two of three
Three brothers to the end
The one went full on Kevin's mom
Now things have changed

Full on Kev's mom
Full on Kev's mom
Full on Kev's mom
Full on

You don't get nothing for free
And this one took the long way
This one took the hard road
I ain't saying who
But it wasn't me

We were three
Kevin's mom made four
(We don't come around anymore)
