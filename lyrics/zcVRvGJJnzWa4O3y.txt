i'm not locked down
i don't owe no one a favor
word on the street that you're gonna meet someone any day now
but i know...
that you're out of control
oh, i know, you sad little boy
i lost my way
i lost my mind on a sunny day
word on the street that there's something really happening
you sit around your home all alone
you sad little boy
i lost my way
but i don't see a problem anyway
word on the street that there's something really happening
but i know...
that you're out of control
oh, i know, you sad little boy
