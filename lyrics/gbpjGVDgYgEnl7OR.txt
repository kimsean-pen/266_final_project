I'm tired of waiting
I'm tired of fading
I'm sick of being depressed
Through all the failing,
I'm syncopating
...At least it's off my chest
Disruptr.
Yeah,
You're kinda fading...
Don't be a baby
I'm sick of being obsessed.
Through all the mating,
Master debating
God knows I'd settle for less
But...
I come from the...
Center of the universe
And I have no time for these...

Distractions.

Disruptr.

Somebody get me alone, I need to feel at home
I need a brain massage
Somebody get me a doctor, I ain't feelin' ill
...But I ain't feelin' this at all... no...
I COME FROM THE
CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE
AND I HAVE NO TIME FOR THESE
SYMPTOMS OF YOUR UNIVERSE
I COME FROM THE
...MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE
AND I HAVE NO TIME FOR THESE
DISTRACTIONS!!!

So here's what it means to be, BE A MAN ABOUT IT
You DON'T forget the family, BE A MAN
And so what if it KILLS you, oh be a MAN about it
BE A GODDAMN MAN, BOY!

...oh, be a man about it all...

Let's go down to the beach
...we'll see the moon...

I come for thee, 'master of the universe'...
And I have no time for these...
Symptoms of your universe...
I come for thee, 'center of the universe'...
And I have no time for these
Symptoms of your universe...
I COME FOR THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE
AND I HAVE NO TIME FOR THESE DISTRACTIONS!!!

Slaving the way for the darks sons of ion...
The world... the world isn't safe... SHUT IT.
