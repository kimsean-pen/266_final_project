Take back the toys that you gave to me
I never knew what to do with them anyway
I never knew how to break up the box
I'll stick to pebbles and boulders and blocks
Take back the toys that you threw my way
I never knew what to do with them anyway
I never knew how to break up the box
I guess the venom is served on the rocks

I been down on the beaten track
Just a holding on, holding out, holding back
Thinking not of what I got but of what I lack
I guess that's what we've been taught all along
It's the drop of poison in the lunch that I got for free
And I've been poppin' the pills placed in front of me
But I had enough baby, I'm breaking free
I never knew why it would take me so long

Take back the toys or I'll destroy 'em do you hear what I say
Take back the toys that you gave to me
I never knew what to do with them anyway
I never knew how to break up the box
I'll stick to pebbles and boulders and blocks

Open my eyes to what I despise and in 14 seconds or more I tear it down
You see they give you toys just to destract
And then they break your mind mind so they can break your back
Got you in so much debt you can't pay it back
And that's the way that it has been far too long

Take back the toys or I'll destroy 'em do you hear what I say
Take back the toys that you gave to me
I never knew what to do with them anyway
I never knew how to break up the box
I'll stick to pebbles and boulders and blocks
Take back the toys that you threw my way
I never knew what to do with them anyway
I never knew how to break up the box
I guess the venom is served on the rocks
