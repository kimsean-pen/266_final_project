Sing for today what remains of the song
Say what you mean
The past rewinds itself into the void
Just avoid the cost

Sanitize their hopeless eyes in dim light leaking through the cracks sealed in their face

Contemplate the animals you've become
So welcoming to all this blood

Keep yourself straight on the path
Take your mind from the past
Lights out and carry on

Straight on course
Back home

Straight on
Lights out carry on straight on

Don't look back

Sing for today what remains of the sunrise

Force your will to carry on
Make your way embrace the sunrise
