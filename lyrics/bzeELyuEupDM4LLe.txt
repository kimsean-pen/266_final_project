Ain't no crying in your beer
Ain't no she walked out the door
Ain't nobody brokenhearted in country music anymore

Everybody's hookin' up, gettin' down
Tearin' up their little town
Loadin' up their cooler and they're headin' south, beach-bound
Workin' on their tan
Cuzi on a beer can
Party every night, throwin' up their hands

Ain't no crying in your beer
Ain't no she walked out the door
Ain't nobody brokenhearted in country music anymore

It killed me when you left me, I thought I was your baby
I was goin' all kinds of climb-the-wall crazy
Searchin' for a sad one on the radio dial
But all I heard was Smile

Everybody's hookin' up, gettin' down
Tearin' up their little town
Loadin' up their cooler and they're headin' south, beach-bound
Workin' on their tan
Cuzi on a beer can
Party every night, throwin' up their hands

Ain't no Crying in your beer
Ain't no She walked out the door
Ain't nobody brokenhearted in country music anymore

I can't even find a bar
Where I can drink alone
'Cause everybody's dancin' to those cover band party songs

Everybody's hookin' up, gettin' down
Tearin' up their little town
Loadin' up their cooler and they're headin' south, beach-bound
Workin' on their tan
Cuzi on a beer can
Party every night, throwin' up their hands

Ain't no crying in your beer
Ain't no she walked out the door
Ain't nobody brokenhearted in country music anymore

Ain't somebody brokenhearted in country music anymore?
