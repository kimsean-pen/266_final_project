I bought you a corsage
And pinned a flower on my jacket
Because this night means a lot to me.
Then you went
And spilled punch
All on my tuxedo shirt
White as a cloud
And now i'm screaming out loud

OH MAN, IT'S TAKING ME OVER

I found another four leaf clover
Up there on the mountain peak
Where it was hard to speak about...
And the only thing that would come out
And the only thing that would come out was.

OH MAN, IT'S TAKING ME OVER
