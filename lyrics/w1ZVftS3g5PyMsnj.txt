Do that to me one more time
Once is never enough with a man like you
Do that to me one more time
I can never get enough of a man like you oh
Kiss me, like you just did
Oh baby, do that to me once again
Pass that by me one more time
Once just isn't enough for my heart to hear
W-h-o-a
Tell it to me one more time
I can never hear enough while I got ya near
W-h-o-a
Say those words again like you just did
Oh baby, tell it to me once again
Do that to me one more time
Once is never enough with a man like you
W-h-o-a
Do that to me one more time
I can never get enough of a man like you
W-h-o-a
Kiss me like you just did
Oh baby, do that to me once again
W-h-o-a baby
Do that to me once again
W-h-o-a baby
Do that to me one more time
(do it again)
One more time
(do it again)
One more time
(do it again)
One more time
(do it again)
One more time
(do it again)
One more time
(do it again)
One more time
