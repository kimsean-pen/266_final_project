One hand. Your palm Your eyes.
Shine the light. Guide us into the void
Into the void, now

Vastness looms behind the cloak
She reveals the words she never spoke of before
Words of before, now

I hear you speaking into the fire
By the river, under the stars
Where darkness first beckoned me

Your mind bleeding away the desire
The triangles formed from afar
Where darkness first beckoned me

Show the cards as they reveal
Your secrets have become unsealed to the door
Into the door, now

Distant screams, I hear them cry
Today's the day I choose to die, to the void
Into the void, now
