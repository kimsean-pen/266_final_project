We start at show time
We stay up all night
I gotta take a break but
But they won't stop, 'till the light's up

It's show time
We stay up all night
I gotta take a break but
But they won't stop, 'till the light's up

I wake up, don't know how I got there
A number written on my arm in a marker
Ten bucks spent on feeling better
And five phone calls, we'll need to fill in the picture

But right now, I've got to straighten out and get to work
I should stay in but tonight might be special
I think I can control the urges at first
I do it over, do it over again

I can't stop my legs, my legs go out late dancin'
I try to wash my face, my lips say "put on make-up"
Can't stay home 'cause my body's got itself all dressed up
And I'm the one who pays for it tomorrow when I wake up

Don't stop 'till the light's up

Oh the daytime people move in slow motion
And my feet walk sloppy cause they can't find a rhythm
And night's falling, oh no not again
It's calling me but I'm not going

Cause right now my resolution's solid rock
Don't tell me that tonight might be special
Just watch me pulling up my socks
And then they get away right from under me

They do it over, do it
They do it over again

I can't stop my legs, my legs go out late dancin'
I try to wash my face, my lips say "put on make-up"
Can't stay home 'cause my body's got itself all dressed up
And I'm the one who pays for it tomorrow when I wake up

(wake up)
My legs go out late dancin'
(wake up)
My lips say "put on make-up"
Can't stay home 'cause my body's got itself all dressed up
And I'll pay for it tomorrow when I wake up

We start at show time
We stay up all night
I gotta take a break but
But they won't stop, 'till the light's up

It's show time
We stay up all night
I gotta take a break but
But they won't stop, 'till the light's up
... (continues in background)

I think I can control the urge
I've got to straighten out and get to work
I think I can control the urge
I think I can control
I think I can control
I think I can control the urge
can control the urge
Ur- ur- ur- ur- ur...

But I can't stop my legs, my legs go out late dancin'
I try to wash my face, my lips say "put on make-up"
Can't stay home 'cause my body's got itself all dressed up
And I'm the one who pays for it tomorrow when I wake up

(wake up)
My legs go out late dancin'
(wake up)
My lips say "put on make-up"
Can't stay home 'cause my body's got itself all dressed up
And I'll pay for it tomorrow when I wake up

It's show time
