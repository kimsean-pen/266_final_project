Well, I'm sorry about the weather
And I'm sorry that the drive was much too far
Seems like everything is business
And we're sorry all the time

When we're home (All alone)
What is home? (On your own)
Home is home (All Alone)
Where we love the weather

Are you sorry that you love me?
Am I sorry I love you too?
Seems it doesn't make a difference
That we're sorry all the time

When we're home (All alone)
What is home? (On your own)
Home is home (All Alone)
Where we love the weather

All alone (What is home?)
On my own (What is home?)
All alone (Home is home)
And I love the weather
