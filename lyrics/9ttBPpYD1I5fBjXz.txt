My name is anything that I want it to be
I'm striking chords in a way you've never seen
But I'm a long shot, I fought the fight and lost
I can take it, I won't make it now.

I've given everything, I've let you take over me
I'm climbing mountains but drowning in the sea
And I admit it, I don't regret it

You've taken everything and left these broken wings
So here, I lay

I never thought you would leave me here
A jaded mess full of hate and fear
I'm playing the victim but I only have myself to blame
I'll rename, restart this game

My name is anything that you want it to be.
Your games are endless but I can guarantee
I'll be the last one to ever give this up

I'll take it all the way until I get my day but here, I lay
I never thought you would leave me here
A jaded mess full of hate and fear
I'm playing the victim but I only have myself to blame

I'll rename, restart this game
I'm giving up this time
I can't take anymore of these confines

I've become something I'm not, a person who plays it safe, everything I hate
So here I'll lay, you finally got your way
I never thought you would leave me here
A jaded mess full of hate and fear
I play the victim I still only have myself to blame
End my reign, I'll fade away
My name I will not say, you have never heard of me
It keeps reminding me what I'll never be
