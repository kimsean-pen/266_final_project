I can't stand it
Told him we could do it all again
We can't believe theives and bandits
Just standing there empty handed
And ... we walk sidewalks up and down
Watch them turn around
Stop and read that body talk
Witness through the screen
Heard them made a scene
Calling out
No more! No more!
Bring him back
Bring him back
Bring him back to me
One time, One time
On time, On time
Yes I know
Yes I know
He can never be
All mine, All mine
All mine, All mine
Take the pictures from my sleep
Cause they always look the same
Left them off.
Show them back from where they came
Shook the ground beneath my feet
...the sound through my veins
When I heard all of their voices
Calling out your name
One time
Shame and slander
Bring them up and call them out again
We can seem so hardheaded
Then talk about reprimanding

...these sidewalks
Ooh, stop and read that body talk
Witness through the screen
Heard they made a scene
Hear our voices ringing out
Bring him back
Bring him back
Bring him back to me
One time, One time
On time, On time
Yes I know
Yes I know
He can never be
All mine, All mine
All mine, All mine
Take the pictures from my sleep
Cause they always look the same
Left them off.
Show them back from where they came
Shook the ground beneath my feet
...the sound through my veins
When I heard all of their voices
Heard them calling out your name
One time
