Intoxicating when you watch me
With eyes that linger on my skin
It feels like lust and then you touch me
I fall away then I begin

You say my kiss is like a building crumbling
I say your soul's dripping from your eyes
And it feels a lot like liquid sunshine
Everytime that I close my

Intoxicating when you watch me
With eyes that linger on my skin
It feels like lust and then you touch me
I'm falling then I begin

I guess I am a building crumbling
While you place (...)
You know me well you see me wandering
And all the same you let me know

Intoxicating when you watch me
With eyes that linger on my skin
It feels like love and then you touch me
I guess I've fallen to my sin
