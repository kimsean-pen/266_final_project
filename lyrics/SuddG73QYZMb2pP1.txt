Sitting by my window,
And I was looking out at the rain.
Sitting by my window Babe,
And I was sitting down, looking out at the rain.
You know something struck me,
Clamped on to me just like, just like a ball and chain.

I said Oh, Oh Baby,
Why do you wanna do all these mean things to me?
I said Oh, Oh Baby, why do you wanna do,
Why do you wanna do all these things to me?
Because you know I love you,
And I'm so sick and tired, so sick and tired of being in misery.
Hey Hey, ball and chain

I know you're gonna miss me Baby,
Oh yes you're going to miss all those sweet things.
Oh yes, I know you're gonna miss me Baby,
Oh I know you're going to miss all those sweet things.
And then you'll find that your whole life will be like mine,
Oh Lord, wrapped up like a ball and chain.

I said Oh, Oh Baby, why do you wanna do all these mean things to me?
I said Oh, Oh Baby, why do you wanna do all these mean things to me?
I know my love for you will last forever,
It's gonna last, I said it's gonna last Oh Good God Almighty,
For eternity,
Oh yeah.

All in vain...
