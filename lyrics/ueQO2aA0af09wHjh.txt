Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me

It was a bright moon lighted night, the moon shining bright
When you and I made love
Your love wasn't true, I'll say onto you
I moaned like a turtle dove

Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me

I'm coming home, no more to roam
Darling I'm coming home
I'm coming home, no more to roam
Darling I'm coming home

Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me

It was a bright moon lighted night, the moon shining bright
When you and I made love
Your love wasn't true, I'll say onto you
I moaned like a turtle dove
