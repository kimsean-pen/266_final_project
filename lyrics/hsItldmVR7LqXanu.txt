Oh bright sun of the night I lift my eyes up to thee
Oh ye amber golden light let the dark sweep over me
Mighty cauldron, oh nidus
I surrender all to thee
Panacean nothingness when nothing is left

These dreadful shades
Dancing in my dwindling sight
And crying out these hollow words
A straying soul in my scorching flesh
Dying down amid this fucking blaze

My swooning world
Infested by strident cries
In a worship of the void

All vanishing in a dull and distant noise

Oh bright sun of the night I lift my eyes up to thee
Oh ye amber golden light let the dark sweep over me
Mighty cauldron, oh nidus
I surrender all to thee
Panacean nothingness when nothing is left

This was my rebirth

As one with pain and with distress
Sweet surrender in serenity
Will I remember this womb at all?
Will I ever know?

Oh bright sun of the night I lift my eyes up to thee
Oh ye amber golden light let the dark sweep over me
Mighty cauldron, oh nidus
I surrender all to thee
Panacean nothingness when nothing is left

I am not here
I do not last
I am the grain in the earth
I am the wave in the deep
I am the softly whispered word
In the murmuring autumn breeze

In front of Antumnos' gate
I beheld the mirror in the lake
Recognize I did not
Nor did I comprehend

Oh bright sun of the night I lift my eyes up to thee
Oh ye amber golden light let the dark sweep over me
Mighty cauldron, oh nidus
I surrender all to thee
Panacean nothingness when nothing is left

This was my rebirth
