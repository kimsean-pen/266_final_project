This feeling
Makes you feel grande
Yet this feeling
Makes me feel small
Don't oblige me what to feel
If I don't feel it at all
You ask me how I feel
Yet close your eyes
To truth be told
Behold...

Whatever it is you demand of me
My love for this world
My love personally
Is larger than life
This is my story
