I feel the flames of your fire
And it's burning my heart
Girl you got game and my number
And it ain't gonna stop

Hold me, love me
Call my name
I just want you to feel me
Breathe me, tease me
Can't control how I feel when you're near me
I can't do nothing about it

Got that feeling coming over me
Sex, sex, sex
Your love is the only remedy
Sex, sex, sex

I can't contain my desire
And I'm coming apart
I'm just a slave for your pleasure
And I'm waiting to fall

Hold me, love me
Call my name
I just want you to feel me
Breathe me, tease me
Can't control how I feel when you're near me
I can't do nothing about it

Got that feeling coming over me
Sex, sex, sex
Your love is the only remedy
Sex, sex, sex

Hold me, love me
Call my name
I just want you to feel me
Breathe me, tease me
Can't control how I feel when you're near me

Hold me, love me
Call my name
I just want you to feel me
Breathe me, tease me
Can't control how I feel when you're near me
I can't do nothing about it

Got that feeling coming over me
Sex, sex, sex
Your love is the only remedy
Sex, sex, sex

Got that feeling coming over me
Sex, sex, sex
Your love is the only remedy
Sex, sex, sex

Got that feeling coming over me
Sex, sex, sex
Your love is the only remedy
Sex, sex, sex
