My eyes are empty, my soul is pretty
You can ease it to me
I just need your empty mind
My eyes are thick and my skull is itchy
And I read no fiction
Is it me or everything in my bones?

My head is sick and my love is tipsy
Is it me; no fiction
I just need your empty mind
My mind electric, my soul reflected
I can hear the ticket
Am I real, or are you the fool?

I'm still alone, I'm
Still alone, still
Still alone as a clown
Still alone, I'm
Still alone, still
Still as lost as I'm found
Still alone, I'm
Still alone, still
Still alone as a clown

My eyes are stitches, my love's a stick shift
I can squeeze or make it
Is it real, or just a dream of mine?
My blood is tipping, my horse is limping
I can ease, or sink in
I just need some grand design

I'm still alone, I'm
Still alone, still
Still alone as a clown
Still alone, I'm
Still alone, still
Still alone but to mount

Oh, it's what I found
Oh, it's what I found
Oh, it's what I found
Oh, it's what I found
Oh, it's what I found
Oh-oo, woh
Oh-oo, woh
Oh-oo, woh
Oh-oo, woh
Oh-oo, woh
Oh-oo, woh
Oh-oo, woh
Oh-oo, woh
