On the 12th of January
You don't need what you can't carry
Blood will flow into the ocean
Our voices breaking with emotion

Crucified, been crucified again
Crucified, been crucified again

In the night, they started singing
They had no right to keep believing
Down below, there's someone screaming
A broken church, no bells are ringing

Crucified, been crucified again
Crucified, been crucified again

Crucified again
Crucified again

Preachers talk on televisions
Hand out the judgements of their religion
When I heard those women singing
They made a sound I could believe in

Crucified, been crucified again

He who strikes the blow forgets it
But he who bears the scar remembers
The fire is burning down to embers
The fire is burning but I can't remember

Crucified, been crucified again
Crucified, been crucified again

Crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again and again and again

All you great and mighty nations
you think you've paid for your higher stations
But cities may be built in the sand
but ours were built by the fathers hands
Crucified, been crucified again
Crucified, been crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again and again and again
till the crowd cries "do it again!"
Crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again and again and again
till the crowd cries "do it again!"
