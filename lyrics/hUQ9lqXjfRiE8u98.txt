I know I've been mistaken
But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made
I've got some imperfections
But how can you collect them all and throw them in my face
But you always find a way, to keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say, to keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away, I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say, to keep you right here waiting

I hope you're not intending
To be so condescending it's as much as I can take
And you're so independent
You just refuse to bend so I keep bending till I break
But you always find a way, to keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say, to keep me right here waiting

And if you chose to walk away, I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say, to keep you right here waiting
I've made a commitment
I'm willing to bleed for you
I needed fulfillment
I found what I need in you
Why can't you just forgive me
I don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made, along the way

But I always find a way, to keep you right here waiting
I always find the words to say, to keep you right here waiting
'Cause you always find a way, to keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say, to keep me right here waiting
And if I chose to walk away, would you be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say, to keep me right here waiting
