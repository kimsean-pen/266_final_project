Would you change your mind at the very last moment
Would you say stop for a second
I'll bet you could think for a minute
In the mornin' light he says when will I see you?

She says "I don't think tomorrow, baby"
Sometimes I wonder if things would change if we stayed together
Would you change your mind at the very last minute
I think you should stop for a second think for a moment

This could be a whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble, whole lotta trouble for you
Well this could be a whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble, whole lotta trouble for you

And the Angel said well you must have had a dream
And you remember it 'til the dream followed through
Till the one end of the dream and the dream came true
When I want somethin' I get it

You'd better go he says "Yes I think I better"
Stop for a moment, I think you should think for a minute
Would you change your mind, at the very last minute
When I want somethin' I get it

Whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble, whole lotta trouble for you
Well this could be a whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble baby, whole lotta trouble for you

Oh yeah, oh yeah not guilty, have mercy
Oh he said you could be my prisoner
Well you're not living in the real world
You're not living in the real world

You're not my friend you're not my love
And this is somethin' that we really don't discuss
Where are you, sometimes I hear you crying
And I wake up and I get through it

Well this could be a whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble, whole lotta trouble for you
Well this could be a whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble baby, a whole lotta trouble for you

Well this could be a whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble, whole lotta trouble for you
Well this could be a whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble baby, a whole lotta trouble for you

Whole lotta trouble, trouble
Whole lotta trouble, whole lotta trouble for you

Well this could be a whole lotta trouble baby
Whole lotta trouble baby, whole lotta trouble for you
This could be a whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble baby, a whole lotta trouble for you
