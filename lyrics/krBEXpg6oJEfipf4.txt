Fire walk away with me, tonight, tonight
I wrote in my diary, that I'm fine, that I'm fine
Let's hang out by the train tracks, tonight tonight
Split that golden heart with me I'll be your guy, your guy

Fire Walk with Me
Fire Walk with Me
Fire Walk with Me
Fire Walk with Me

Let's get drunk in my room, it's red, it's red
There is something in my room, in my head, in my head
Laura Palmer where's she been, she's dead, she's dead
Some one tell her father, she's dead, she's dead

Fire Walk with Me
Fire Walk with Me
Fire Walk with Me
Fire Walk with Me
