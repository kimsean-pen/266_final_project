Coz we got nothing else to do
London Skinhead Crew
Scars, tattoos, crombie coats, full of trouble
We grew up on dead end streets
Lack of teeth - full of dreams
Drinking beer and forever blowing bubbles

Years go passing by but we are still about
Against society and all that crap
This is not a fashion its a way of life
Getting older but we wont give up

Coz we got nothing else to do
London Skinhead Crew
Scars, tattoos, crombie coats, full of trouble
We grew up on dead end streets
Lack of teeth - full of dreams
Drinking beer and forever blowing bubbles

Football on Saturday, Camden Sunday night
And were skint again but we dont care
Smell of 2 stroke every year at Isle of Wight
Skinhead Reggae beat and short cropped hair

Coz we got nothing else to do
London Skinhead Crew
Scars, tattoos, crombie coats, full of trouble
We grew up on dead end streets
Lack of teeth - full of dreams
Drinking beer and forever blowing bubbles

We are the lost generation with not much left to lose
Wearing shiny brogues and tonic suits
All we want is a bit of thrill, fags and booze
And crazy skinhead girls in monkey boots

Coz we got nothing else to do
London Skinhead Crew
Scars, tattoos, crombie coats, full of trouble
We grew up on dead end streets
Lack of teeth - full of dreams
Drinking beer and forever blowing bubbles
Coz we got nothing else to do
London Skinhead Crew
Scars, tattoos, crombie coats, full of trouble
We grew up on dead end streets
Lack of teeth - full of dreams
Drinking beer and forever blowing bubbles
