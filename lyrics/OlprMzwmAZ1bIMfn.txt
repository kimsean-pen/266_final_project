You got a way of making me feel insane
Like I can't trust my own brain
Unless it's screaming your name
I'd have it no other way
I'd have it no other way
And maybe that's why I stay
How many times can we pick up the same fight?
Can we keep screaming all night?
And make up until it's light?
That's when I say that you're right
And feel your body on mine
Oh, maybe that's why I stay

I could be somewhere, chilling on a beach
I could be with someone, making me happy
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
I could put my phone down
Just pick up my keys
I could let you go and we could let it be
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love

Keep coming back
Guess you can say I'm attached
Last time we called it a wrap
I came begging and all that
You're like a habit, it's bad
I gotta have it, it's bad
Oh no, I'm not even mad, no

I could be somewhere, chilling on a beach
I could be with someone, making me happy
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
I could put my phone down
Just pick up my keys
I could let you go and we could let it be
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love

It's the way you keep me up all night
It's the way you make me lose my mind
Every time I'm saying one more night
It's the way you know I'm yours
It's the way you know I'm yours for life

I could be somewhere, chilling on a beach
I could be with someone, making me happy
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
I could put my phone down
Just pick up my keys
I could let you go and we could let it be
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
