All my life I've been searching for something
Something I can put my finger on
Maybe I've been living for the weekend
Maybe I've been living for this cyber soul
Every Friday just about midnight
All my problems seem to disappear
Everyone that I miss when I'm distant
Everybody's here

I need love
Cause only love is true
I need every wakin' hour with you
And my friends cause they're so beautiful
Yeah my friends they are so beautiful
They're my friends

All my life I've been wastin', wastin'
Wastin' all my money, all my time
All the time that I'm waitin', waitin'
Waitin for the moment you are mine
The song about yeah I'm thinkin', thinkin'
Thinkin all the things that I've done wrong
All the time yeah I was forgettin'
You were mine all along

I need love
Cause only love is true
I need every wakin' hour with you
And my friends cause they're so beautiful
Yeah my friends they are so beautiful
They're my friends

I need love
Cause only love is true
I need every wakin' hour with you
And my friends cause they're so beautiful
Yeah my friends they are so beautiful
They're my friends

They're my friends...
