Oh,
Bright son of destiny
Bringer of light in this darkness
Beautiful prince
Now take my hand again
Forever tied by the thread of our fate
Now, we're together again

Cold and desolate is the nature of my soul
Forever indifferent to the screams of shadows
Lying deep in the void
So give it up
Now face the score
In the heart of the chosen one
There's no deliverance

I have to face all this scorn
Staining my own land with useless tears
Look in the eyes of the one
Feeding himself with my deepest fears
Oh,
I'll touch your heart again
Waken the cold lonely dreamer
I, will illuminate your soul
Wounded by emptiness
Please take me far from this land of pain
Now, on the waves of the sea

I had to face all this scorn
Staining my own land with useless tears
Look, now I am too tired to fight
And run away from this filling light

Nightmares and shadows
Together we'll drown in the sea
Believe me!
You'll walk by my side
