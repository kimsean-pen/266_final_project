I'm always pacing back and forth inside just to find out what it is
That you would take to make you to feel alive and the days non-repetitive
Well in my defense, you were like all the rest
I can't pretend I know everything
When I'm expecting less it just makes more sense but we, yeah we

We can still be anything, living a life in symmetry
Just don't grow too reliant on me
Cause I'm not the person I want to be
We can still be anything, I want the world to set you free
Just don't grow too reliant on me
Cause I'm not the person that I want to be

Thought I was tangled up in this position and thinking I could improvise
What goes along with spending time on your own
Is making sure you always open your eyes this time
But this is all I got, I know it's not a lot
I can't pretend I know everything
When I'm expecting less it just makes more sense but we, yeah we

We can still be anything, living a life in symmetry
Just don't grow too reliant on me
Cause I'm not the person I want to be
We can still be anything, I want the world to set you free
Just don't grow too reliant on me
Cause I'm not the person that I want to be

All the lights create more strife
And I'm telling you if it's meant to be
The last thing I'd ever want to do is leave you hanging like tapestry
And I can lead the way
As long as you don't stray too far from me
I'm always pacing back and forth inside just to find out what it is
That you would take to make you to feel alive
And the days non-repetitive

We could still be anything, living the life in symmetry
I hope your tears are drying on me
Cause now I'm the person I want to be
We could still be anything, I want the world to set you free
And I hope your tears are drying on me
Cause now I'm the person I want to be
