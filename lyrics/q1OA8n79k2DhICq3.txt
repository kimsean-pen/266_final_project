Dressed in the chains we've chosen to strife,
We got to stay in our prisons for the rest of our lives,
We got to pray for severance...

Wake in disgrace of the fate in our hands,
We got the fire in our hearts and our heads in the sand,
We got to pay remembrance...

It sleeps in the heart of every man,
And as we walk in our trance hide as best as we can,
We all need our innocence...

Blessed with the pain we have chosen to hide,
We got to stay inside our walls for the rest of the night,
Below the wheels of reverence...

Where can we meet when the war left behind,
When a mother blind with grief has abandoned her child,
We got to leave in difference...

Swear this morning lights the hour,
Embrace a different sky,
Divide the sun from the blind!
Swear your sorrow blinds the hour,
Inhale a different light,
Divide the stars from the night!

The river flows, the morning cries the end.
The wind won't blow, to sanctify defense.
The tears you show, are violation sent.

Swear this morning lights the hour,
Embrace a different sky,
Divide the sun from the blind!
Swear your morning light devours,
To wave the world goodbye,
Exile the sun from your life!
