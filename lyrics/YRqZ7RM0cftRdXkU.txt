We'll do it all
Everything
On our own.

We don't need
Anything
Or anyone.

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lay with me and just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel.

Those three words
Are said too much.
They're not enough.

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lay with me and just forget the world?

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads.

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lay with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old.
Show me a garden that's bursting into life.
If I lay here
If I lay here
Would you lay with me and just forget the world?
