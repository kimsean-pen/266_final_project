I try not to confine
My knowledge and my mind
Answers are mine to find
Between all unspoken lines

People kneeled
Despots guiding
Secrets sealed
They keep hiding
Time to set sails, find the truth by ourselves

We can't deny
Power leads us to play
Breaking lives on the way

Conquer hearts and souls of wanderers
And the world is a playground
Conjure ghosts of ancient travelers
May the light of their wisdom shine all around

I came to realize
It was all before my eyes
Truth is lying inside
In the deep where worlds collide

Crosses raised
Eyes are closing
Voices praise
Hands are joining
Time to question, faith or resignation?

We can't deny
Power leads us to play
Breaking lives on the way!

Conquer hearts and souls of wanderers
And the world is a playground
Conjure ghosts of ancient travelers
May the light of their wisdom shine

Time to confess
Bloody progress
Has led our world to its fall
Book of Nature
The real adventure
Remains unknown to us all

I promise, my heart is done with wandering
I have found truth in love

Conquer hearts and souls of wanderers
And the world is a playground
Conjure ghosts of ancient travelers
May the light of their wisdom shine all around...
All around...
All around...
