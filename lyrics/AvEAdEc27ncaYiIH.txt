Back in my hometown
The main street's dying down
It's like there's nothing left of it
No more high school grounds
They tore that building down
And everything we built
Well, I miss
I cut off my own friends
So lost inside seeing them
Feels like were back there instantly
To me

We all need a chance
The backyard fires on
And we stop telling tales of how life used to be
But years have come and gone
But these stories carry on
Looking back, they're better than they used to be

Cause you shoulda seen the size of the guy's we've were fightin'
And we shouldn't be alive at the speed's we were driving
But momma always taught us never to tell a lie
And every team I've played in always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive
It was during those olds
It gets a little better
Every time we're together

It's funny how we change
And some things stay the same
God, I miss the glory days
Always
Daylight getting near
We shed a few more tears
Lord, I love the memories we've made
The years have come and gone
But the stories carry on
Looking back, they're better than they used to be

Cause you shoulda seen the size of the guy's we've were fightin'
And we shouldn't be alive at the speed's we were driving
Momma always taught us never to tell a lie
And every team I've played in always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive
It was during those olds
It gets a little better
Every time we're together

Cause you shoulda seen the size of the guy's we've were fightin'
And we shouldn't be alive at the speed's we were driving
Momma always taught us never to tell a lie
And every team I've played in always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive
It was during those olds
It gets a little better
Every time we're together
It was during those olds
It gets a little better
Every time we're together
