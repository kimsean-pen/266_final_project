So tired of all this misfortune
Been wandering for most of the lies
They've stolen the land we've been roaming
I swear it's the end of the line

We'll fight
We survive

Inside out
Upside down
All around
Underground

Pale faces of death and destruction
All our sons have died
We trusted with blind ambition
You promised with handshakes and lies

Be the
Moonlight
You'll die
In this strike

Inside out
Upside down
All around
Underground

We're tired of all this bad fortune
Been fighting for all of our lives
We'll reach into your socket
Rip back your scalp as you cry

We'll fight
We survive

Inside out
Upside down
All around
Underground

Be the
Moonlight

Inside out
Upside down
All around
Underground
