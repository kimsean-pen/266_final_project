I have been at the steps of the powerful elite
And I have been at the hands of a cold-blooded machine.
But from the buildings on Broadway to the 15th precinct
Every millionaire and runaway is coming home tonight.

But even though the boat is sinking.
And even though the whole foundation is stressed,
It gets worse when nobody is speaking out, because things can always get worse.
They will get worse.

I have been through the walls of the prominent elite
And I have been at the hands of the relentless beliefs.
And I know you'll be making your money off of someone else when the bottom drops out.

And even though the house is burning,
And even though the infrastructure was crushed,
It gets worse when nobody's left to listen, because things can always get worse
When the bottom drops out.

You fuck. I fuckin blame you, you fucker (you fuck). I fuckin know the reason you came. Your name, your place, your time will come when the bottom drops out.
And even though you'll get away with. Even though people like you don't do time.
I know someday your little black heart will pop. Someday you're gonna die.

Things can always get so much worse
when the bottom drops out.
