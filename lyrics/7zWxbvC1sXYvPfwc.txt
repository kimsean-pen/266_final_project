Oh oh oh
Bad moon
You belong to meBarely one
Star which hung
Sailing to the sea
City moon
So soon
One remaining day
Black night
Outside
Give them all to say
And yellow time is overhead
Unchanging things imprinted
Can it all be clear?
City moon
So soon
You're the world to me
Barely one
Star which hung
Sailing to the sea
And yellow time is overhead
Unchanging things imprinted
Can it all be clear?
