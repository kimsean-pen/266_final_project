Throw it all away
Until we are erased
And it doesn't mean a thing
And i cant remember what the skies look like(?)
Or will i found out that im late for salvation
What if tomorrow never comes
Don't let it slip away
This is my world now
I cant let you bring me down
Let this new faith guide me through
And things will come my way
Burn it down
Join the light
Dead eyes
Will see again
Gravity takes control
Don't forsake my troubled times
Im starting to regret not telling you all the things that i should have
Roll the dice
Just one more time
Don't let it slip away
This is my world now
I cant let you bring me down
Let this new faith guide me through
And things will come my way
Burn it down
And join the light
Dead eyes
Will see again
I will be reborn
Im gonna take the world on
Someday i will
Im gonna take the world on
Someday i will
Throw it all away
Afraid i will drift on the open sea
I regret now telling you all the things i should have
Roll the dice
Just one more time
Don't let it slip away
This is my world now
I cant let you bring me down
Let this new faith guide me through
And things will come my way
Burn it down
Join the light
Dead eyes
Will see again
