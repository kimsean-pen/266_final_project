We pass the buck around
I hear the sound of your future hell, rotted
I seen the shape of it myself
The night I fell into a mushroom cloud, twice

The air was serpentine when I fell
As we're waiting for the sun to go down, tonight
I walk the purple trail till blue
Thinking the fortune told true
This time

I hear the crumbling down
People seemed like they were somewhere else
Eyes are glowing jewels overwhelmed
By somewhere far above the filthy ground
I guess

They're in the dizzy clouds
No bounty greater in the common hells
The grain is everybody's for the meal
But something is in their grade-A mouths, tonight

They pour the turpentine in the well
I was looking for another way out
I found the rocky trail by moon
And slept for twenty hours through

Dreamt of twin lions
Bonded by destiny
Of being the sirens
Sometimes we chose our fate
That's why stay
