You don't love her but you say so
It's alright, we all got things we don't know
I don't even mind
'Cause I like being by your side
I'll be waiting, I'll be patient
'Til you find your favorite location
Perfectly designed
For a love to be oh so blind

We'll be falling hard in the black hole
Of our universe
And the whole world is ours
But we won't know, 'cause we're too busy loving love, uh

(Eyeyey) we're too busy loving love, uh
(Eyeyey) 'cause we're too busy loving love
(Eyeyey) we're too busy loving love, uh

Don't listen to what they say
They shouldn't be just one type of way
Traditional old rules
Only lock up the perfect jewels
Show your feelings, say it loud
I love you someone much, damn, I'm proud
We're anciently new school
Loving love like we're supposed to

We'll be falling hard in the black hole
Of our universe
And the whole world is ours
But we won't know, 'cause we're too busy loving love, uh

(Eyeyey) we're too busy loving love, uh
(Eyeyey) 'cause we're too busy loving love
(Eyeyey) we're too busy loving love, uh
(Eyeyey) we're too busy loving love, uh
(Eyeyey) 'cause we're too busy loving love
(Eyeyey) we're too busy loving love, uh
