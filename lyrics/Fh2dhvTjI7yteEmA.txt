I'm feeling very low
I hope it doesn't show

When I'm low
The boats they just don't flow
Oh they never go (They never go)
They never go

At first saw the sunrise
But not for too long
I wish the wind would blow
I wish it was strong, oh

(*)I could always cry a tear
So could you
We could wash the way clear
To let me through

Maybe tomorrow
I'll be there, too
We'll still be together
Ad still be blue

(*repeat)

Let me through (repeat)
