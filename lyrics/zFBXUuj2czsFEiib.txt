If I pay you five dollars will you try to make my bed?
If I pay you ten would you make me well instead?
I love your baby, baby harmonies
You really brighten up my basement suite, suite

We should go down to the mall
Look at people, judge them all
Judge them before they judge us and leave there feeling bad

We should sit and pick our hands
I think you're a genius
And when we make your hangnails bleed
You deserve a phd

If I pay you five dollars will you try to make my bed?
If I pay you ten would you make me well instead?
I love your honey, honey harmonies
You really brighten up my basement suite, suite

We should put that record on
The one you found when you were gone
The one that has those sad, sad songs
And makes you sing out loud

We could start a basement band
Guitar hooks caught in your hands
Will travel through the west side nights
And drown out humming street lights

If I pay you five dollars will you try to make my bed?
If I pay you ten would you make me well instead?
I la-la love your la-la harmonies
You really brighten up my basement suite, suite
