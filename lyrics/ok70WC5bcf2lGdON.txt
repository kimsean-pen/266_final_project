Chilled in the kitchen of a city tomb
The light would flicker like a violent womb
The night was thicker than a smoky fume
Eliza waited in her room

Ben, he loved her like he loved no one
The way she laughed and held a smoking gun
The way she always said "what's done is done"
And he is not the only one

Love is a gentle thing
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring

A victim here with a sharp sharp blade
And Ben he knew how she was getting paid
Her water broke and they would have to wait

And when he knew that she was fooling
He faced the mirror to avoid the thing
We're out of money and we've sold the bling
And I just want to take you home
I just want to take you home

Love is a gentle thing
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring

And I'm wondering
Ring
And I'm wondering
