She's a slut on the lineup
She patrols the party, oh
What pretty hair and nice underwear to wear

Hot pink lizard smile
Light drowns her
Tits out for the camera
"Take the blowjob," she said
"I'm bored are you done now?"

Hayley

Sucker for a smiling cowboy who has cash, like most
And you grandstand like a manipulative man
All catcalls and lipgloss
And you drink like a terrible fish
At the party you kissed
And speak of California
You're headin' for the sun
And you're always getting warmer

Hayley

And so he took the gun
And he shot you in the ear
Did you hear?
Do you know who you are?
And now you're a whore
And you're smiling ear to ear
And there's nothing that you fear
Except loving again.
