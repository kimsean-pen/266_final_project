The yellow sun in the sky whenever you walk
A little white lie written in chalk
The red spot in your eye whenever you talk
Spit it out now
And at the end of the day when you kick back
You give all new meaning to the same crap
So many tiles I can't keep track
Start all over when it's all over

What's on your mind?
Spit it out now
It looks like the time
Is running out now
So spit it out now

There's a window of time, you're in the nick of it
You look at the view and you're sick of it
You get the urge to throw a brick in it
Go ahead now
So look out cause there's no way to stop it
Every bubble you blow, I'm gonna pop it
So look out below, I'm gonna drop it
Listen up now, listen up now

What's on your mind?
Spit it out now
It looks like the time
Is running out now
It's running out now

What's it about now?
Spit it out now
What's it about now?

Spit it out now
Spit it out now
