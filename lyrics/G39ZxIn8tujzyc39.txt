For all the times you left me bleeding
Clouded, weakened by the haze
Cut off my pride, enough to forgive
Reconcile, back to square nothing

Spent some quality time with the demon of mine
I like the way you struggle but you know I'm here to win

It seems I lost my direction
Don't have the strength to let it slip
Have no desire for the shore
Just let me play here for some time

Is this how I want to spend my days?
Shadowed, it fears me, my utopia
Try to find some peace to destroy
These are my sins, I'm heading to fall
Never understood though I accepted
All the weakness that I discover
You gave me a place to hide and lost the key
Drowned my head just to see it sink (to the bottom)

Spent some quality time with the demon of mine
I like the way you struggle but you know I'm here to win
Spent some quality time with my borrowed smile
The gleam is replaced, rip me open and erase me

Spent some quality time with the demon of mine
I like the way you struggle but you know I'm here to win
Spent some quality time with my borrowed smile
The gleam is replaced, rip me open and erase me
