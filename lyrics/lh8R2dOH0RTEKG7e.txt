And you know you're na-na gonna lie to you
And in your own way
You know you're na-na gonna lie to you
And in your own way

And I lie some other day
Oh, to do in
And you say
You

Know, know too well
Know the chill
Know she breaks
My Siren

No teenage flesh
Know that she'll
Know she breaks
My Siren

Now I know that you know I

Never was one for a prissy girl
Coquette, call in for an ambulance
Reach high, doesn't mean she's holy
Just means she's got a cellular handy

Almost brave
Almost pregnant
Almost, ya know, in love
"Vanilla."
Vanilla

And you know you're gonna lie to you
And in your own way
And you know you're gonna lie to you
And in your own way

And you don't need the light on
To guide you through the southern lands
You go
Say it, oh yes

Know know too well
Know the chill
Know she breaks
My Siren

No teenage flesh
Know that she'll
Know she breaks
My Siren

Never was one for a prissy girl
Coquette, call in for an ambulance
Reach high, doesn't mean she's holy
Just means she's got a cellular handy

Almost brave
Almost pregnant
Almost, you know, in love
Vanilla, yes

Never was one for a prissy girl
Coquette, call in for an ambulance
Reach high, doesn't mean she's holy
Just means she's got a cellular handy

Almost brave
Almost pregnant
Almost, you know, in love
Vanilla, say it again, yes

Never was one for a prissy girl
Coquette, call in for an ambulance
Reach high, doesn't mean she's holy
Just means she's got a cellular handy

Almost brave
Almost pregnant
Almost, you know, in love
Vanilla
