Embrace in your arms
Little did I know that
You would put me in harms way
Way, way, way
Retrograde
I wish you loved me like you
Said that you would
I wish you loved me like you
Thought that you could
Now I'm keeping away
Now I'm keeping away
Now I'm keeping away
Ready, steady, mercury, retrograde
Ready, steady, mercury, retrograde
You promised me the Earth,
Moon and stars
Little did I know that
You would leave me with scars
Thought I need you but I don't
Thought I need you but I don't
Thought I need you but I don't need you
Thought I need you but I don't need you
I wish you loved me like you
Said that you would
I wish you loved me like you
Thought that you could
What do you have to say?
What do you have to say?
Retrograde, not another
Not another, not another
Not another, not another
Not another, not another
Not another, not another
Day, day, day
Not another retrograde!
I don't owe you
A goddamn thing
No, no, no
I don't owe you
A goddamn thing
No, no, no
Not another
You miss me, I know you wanna kiss me
I like the fact that you
Cannot resist me
Come on give it to me, no, no, no
