I got your fingerprints on my skin
Ever since that day you've let me in
I feel your vibes, they are circlin'
You cut so deep, cut so deep
Who needs love leaning to one side
We're free fallin' in the jungle lights?
You have it all, got me on standby
You cut so deep, cut so deep

'Cause I thought that the trust had gone
Didn't see this comin' along
You made me a believer
You made me a believer

And now I'm
I'm shoutin' from the rooftop, baby
Tell me, will you come and save me?
I'm shoutin' from the rooftop, baby
Come pick me up, come pick me up
Are you just a lover or my twins soul?
Fire the shots and I need to know
I'm shoutin' from the rooftop, baby
Come pick me up, come pick me up

So my heart was so tired and numb
It got so sick, too much went wrong
You had that match and you let it strike
You cut so deep, cut so deep
Got your darts hitting my bull's-eye
Watching hope doin' overtime
Keep me hangin' on through the night
You cut so deep, cut so deep

Hey, I thought that the trust had gone
Didn't see this comin' along
You made me a believer
You made me a believer, oh

And now I'm
I'm shoutin' from the rooftop, baby
Tell me, will you come and save me?
I'm shoutin' from the rooftop, baby
Come pick me up, come pick me up
Are you just a lover or my twins' soul?
Fire the shots and I need to know
I'm shoutin' from the rooftop, baby
Come pick me up, come pick me up

Pick me up when I'm feeling low
Pick me up and show me home
All my senses just need to know
Why your heart feels like gold
So pick me up when I'm feeling low
Pick me up and show me home
All my senses just need to know
Why your heart feels like gold

I'm shoutin' from the rooftop, baby
Tell me, will you come and save me?
I'm shoutin' from the rooftop, baby
Come pick me up, come pick me up
Are you just a lover or my twins soul?
Fire the shots and I need to know
I'm shoutin' from the rooftop, baby
Come pick me up, come pick me up

Pick me up when I'm feeling low
Pick me up and show me home
All my senses just need to know
Why your heart feels like gold
Feels like gold
