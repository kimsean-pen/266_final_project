Fuck your pride
Don't keep denying yourself of help
Of help that you know that you need
I plead don't keep silent
Trying to be too self-reliant

Your heads been hanging to the floor for far too long
How the hell were you supposed to see the point in being present
Taking it day by day

Trust me you don't have to be so lonely
When caught in a snare
Closed off you're unaware
There's so many people that care for you
We care for you
We want to pull you out, through and through
We're here for you

You toss and turn in your bed at night
You tell everybody you'll be all right
You isolate yourself
Think that you're not good enough
to show yourself to the world outside
You don't want to let them see you lie
This house is cold, my mistakes are my prison

Toxic thoughts chasing their tails,
I'm lost out at sea and I've got holes in the sails
Don't want to be a burden
So here's a smile never know that I'm hurting

Your heads been hanging to the floor for far too long
How the hell were you supposed to see the point in being present
Taking it day by day

Trust me you don't have to be so lonely
When caught in a snare
Closed off you're unaware
There's so many people that care for you
We care for you
We want to pull you out, through and through
We're here for you

Reach out your hands you need out of your head tonight
Reach out your hands
You need out, you need out

Trust me you don't have to be so lonely
When caught in a snare
Closed off you're unaware
There's so many people that care for you
We care for you
We want to pull you out, through and through
We're here for you
