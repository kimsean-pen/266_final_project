Remember when our so-called friend
Would not call out to you
While tumbling loosely out a hole
Punched through your home
It's pretty clear, though you could hear
You truly finally knew
In time, he'll tell his tale the way he'd like it told
Now he isn't on the phone
His story might as well be so

Well, loving is as loving does
And I'd say we should know
Because we both have loved, have lost, and are alone
Your face's falling tears
To me they're lovely and they're dear
Though you don't love me
And it's clear that I will never see you in my arms
There's no room in your heart
For even this finely-sharpened dart
Although I had started to think there might be hope
It isn't so

So wake up
Make up some new song again
Around the same tune
The water cools, the leaves they fall
The sun it bends, the summer ends
Our so-called friend doesn't need you

So proceed out the door and down the street
December's lying near
But in the oven's heat this house is now a home
Sixty days of trips and stays
You took to tell me, dear
That you cannot love me because you secretly still love a stone
Although I put my lips to your face
Trying to push his kiss out of its place
Although my heart started to race
Now it has slowed
I'll let it go
