It's your world and you create it
Just remove the parts you hated
Pick the places that you run from
It's too early to abandon

You're not living you're just existing
Sweet temptation, no it's resisting

If you tune in, it will pay of
Keep it quite so it's red hot

You're not living you're just existing
Sweet temptation, no it's resisting

Given up and you don't know why
you're falling round till 6 in the morning
Given up and you don't know why
you're falling down till 6 in the morning

It creates a little friction
But you say you're with conviction

You're not living you're just existing
Sweet temptation, no it's resisting

Given up and you don't know why
you're falling round till 6 in the morning
Given up and you don't know why
you're falling down till 6 in the morning
Given up and you don't know why
you're falling round till 6 in the morning
Given up and you don't know why you're falling down

Aaaahhhh
Aaaahhhh

It's your world and you create it
Just remove the parts you hated

You're not living you're just existing
Sweet temptation, no it's resisting

Given up and you don't know why
you're falling round till 6 in the morning
Given up and you don't know why
you're falling down till 6 in the morning
Given up and you don't know why
you're falling round till 6 in the morning
Given up and you don't know why you're falling down
