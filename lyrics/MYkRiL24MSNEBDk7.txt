I'm fading out like a melody
Twisting around to fit in to your mould
Faith is a healer but as time passes by I fall deeper
As I watch you keep on digging this hole
Standing the ground you paved for me
Figuring out how to spring from your hold
Being mean don't make me keener
Am I fooling myself I don't need ya?
Watch this space, I'm getting ready to go

Wanna get out of here
Away from you
If it means dragging myself off my knees that's' what I must do
Wanna get out of here
That's how I feel
Oh but the time that it takes me to leave when I've dug in my heels

I'm looking out for a remedy
If I make mistakes can they be my own?
All my life I've been a dreamer
Now it's time to become a believer
If I have to I will do this alone

Wanna get out of here
Away from you
If it means dragging myself off my knees that's' what I must do
Wanna get out of here
That's how I feel
Oh but the time that it takes me to leave when I've dug in my heels

Oh you gotta believe what I'm saying
I've gotta get out of here
I've gotta get out of here

Gotta get out of here
Away from you
If it means starting all over again that's what I must do
Gotta get out of here
Away from you
If it means dragging my, dragging my, dragging myself, dragging myself

Gotta get out of here
Away from you
If it means starting all over again that's what I must do
Gotta get out of here
That's how I feel
Oh but the time that it takes me to leave when I've dug in my heels
