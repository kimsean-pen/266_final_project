She held that same hand I hold
It's hard for me to know that
How long she was beside your heart
And you say you've moved on
If I'm going to fall
Are you coming down?
You were just a young boy I know
Tell me that you let go far

If I say that I'm hurt if I say it enough
And I walk on my own
Take what you like it goes like this fine
Now what you say
And if you're gonna leave me cause I can't let go
leave the past and I'll bring it back once more
Take what you like it goes like this fine

I've got love running through my veins
And it's only started
You've got something over me
And it's hard to take it
Now we've taken flight
Everyday in my mind
I know where I should walk alone
Wasn't so long ago far

If you wanna go, if you wanna
If you wanna go
They say love, well it goes
But I know, that ours won't

If I say that I'm hurt if I say it enough
And I walk on my own
Take what you like it goes like this fine
Now what you say
And if you're gonna leave me cause I can't let go
leave the past and I'll bring it back once more
Take what you like it goes like this fine

I can't seem to live without you
