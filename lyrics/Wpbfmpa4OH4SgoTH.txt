Another morning breaks
The shadow side of me
It's like pulling thread until I fall apart
They say to live with this
Song I have to sing
It's the cross that hangs deep below my heart
And when I get the feeling
I'll let the damn walls break
Let the damn walls break down
Nothing's gonna drown me out
From the top of the world to the bottom of the ocean
Scream it loud from the underground
Listen now you're not taking me down
Nothing's gonna drown me out
(Nothing's gonna drown me)
Feel the violent rage
Washing over me
I can barely breathe, bury me alive
All the tragedy
Becomes a symphony
For the pain I feel, my final goodbye
And when I get the feeling
I'll let the damn walls break
Let the damn walls break down
Nothing's gonna drown me out
From the top of the world to the bottom of the ocean
Scream it loud from the underground
Listen now you're not taking me down
Nothing's gonna drown me out
(Scream it loud from the underground)
(Nothing's gonna drown me out)
Rise
Can you hear me now
Rise
Can you see me now
Rise
Can you hear me now
Rise
Can you see me now
And when I get the feeling
I'll let the damn walls break
Let the damn walls break down
Nothing's gonna drown me out
From the top of the world to the bottom of the ocean
Scream it loud from the underground
Listen now you're not taking me down
Nothing's gonna drown me out
Rise
Can you hear me now
Rise
Nothing's gonna drown me out
