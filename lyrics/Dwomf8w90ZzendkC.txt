I'm a danger to myself
The other night I felt
In the eyes of the girls
I got nothing else to burn

Yeah, every night I break my voice and my dreams
In fancy clubs in town I laugh with my team
Yeah, every night I break my voice and my dreams
In dusty clubs around I laugh with my team

My worn out face is not that grey
Guess I'm more tired than yesterday
So I drink down a coffee at the counter
Watching human beings just for an hour

Every night
It's such a mess
Ain't hard to guess
I'm a danger to myself

You're such a disaster
My girlfriend used to say
And I smiled like a bum
Out the window where's the sun?

Yeah, every night I break my voice and my dreams
In fancy clubs in town I laugh with my team
Yeah, every night I break my voice and my dreams
In dusty clubs around I laugh with my team
