I be getting to the money, everybody mad
I think I'm getting too much money, everybody mad
The same old nigga from the block
The same old nigga with the pot
The same old nigga for the trap
Everybody hatin on and then they bounce right back

I done spent a whole lotta time overseas
Double up my money cause you know I want cheese
I been in my hometown playin with the key
When they fell off the boat yeah I'm talking 'bout Belize
I know with some whole lotta niggas that was hatin'
I know with some whole lotta bitches that was takin'
So I shut them niggas up, bitches feelin' nuts
I was doing that when I was six so I had to stay patient
Takin' over summer nigga, tell me what's the bid?
Heard you still cuffing, nigga tell me what it is?
You ain't payin' no pills, buyin' no bags, buyin' no heels
God damn let the bitch leave
All I see is 20's, 50's, 100's
If feeding caught a mil', fuck the whip

I don't wanna but to make this nigga sick to the stomach

I be getting to the money, everybody mad
I think I'm getting too much money, everybody mad
The same old nigga from the block
The same old nigga with the pot

The same old nigga for the trap
Everybody hatin on and then they bounce right back

She was acting stingy, now she wanna give it up
Fast line, O.T. im'ma live it up
Now my ex girl tryna make me jealous cause she got a new nigga
She don't know that I don't give a fuck
I got me a deal but I still in the street
Heard a couple niggas, talkin' let they got beef
They forget sesame teriyaki sauce with the rice
On the side sweaty pussy nigga sweet
I got all this money on my motherfuckin' mind
Diamonds in my dial like I can't even see the time
All my niggas pull up, please don't let me bend the line
Any super extra winnin niggas off the line

All I know is Bloods, Crips, Pirus
I am a West Side nigga don't get it fucked up
Nigga sick cause he thought I locked up

I be getting to the money, everybody mad
I think I'm getting too much money, everybody mad
The same old nigga from the block
The same old nigga with the pot
The same old nigga for the trap
Everybody hatin on and then they bounce right back

I be getting to the money, everybody mad
I think I'm getting too much money, everybody mad
The same old nigga from the block
The same old nigga with the pot
The same old nigga for the trap
Everybody hatin on and then they bounce right back
