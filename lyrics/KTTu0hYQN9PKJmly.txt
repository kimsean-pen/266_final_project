Behind the walls of Christ
the hypocrites recite songs to glorify
their king who's died in vain
they betray the holy son

Extinguishing his light
Their greed and their desire
Have torn him from his cross

They took down upon us
As their God looks down upon them
And sees them for what they are

Devoted to their saints and all their hails to Mary
Confessions show their weakness
Pathetic show of faith
They ease their guilt
Through the Rosary
Their false display of pit
Condemns the God they praise

Their words of adoration
Spewing from their lips
Lie far from their hearts
Their insincere tears
Fall from lying eyes
They'll never see his kingdom
they'll burn with Jesus
