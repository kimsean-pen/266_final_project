Two-faced drama rebellion
Are you the Joker, King or Queen?
Place your cards as they're coming
Came to win, lost everything
Gambling rider pull the strings
Pull them tighter
Let them in

Come and play another day
Throw your mask away
I don't care what you say
Cause your lovely words decay
Come and play another day
Welcome to the anteroom of death

Hide your conspiracies so
Who's got the keys and who has not?
Sell your fortune to me
Cause I can still read behind all that
Burn your fingers
Trade a dream
Watch the clock as it's ticking

Come and play another day
Throw your mask away
I don't care what you say
Cause your lovely words decay
Come and play another day
Welcome to the anteroom of death

Blinded in the dark
I'm touching the scars of tainted hearts
If you're searching learn to see
Honesty is all you need
Take the bow finally

Watch the clock 'cause it's ticking and ticking ticking tock
Watch the clock 'cause it's ticking and ticking ticking tock
Are you joker, king or queen?
Two-faced drama rebellion
Are you joker, king or queen?
Came to win
Are you joker, king or queen?
Came to win
Lost everything

Come and play (come and play)
Another day (another day)
I don't care what you say
Because your lovely words decay
Come on and play another day
Throw your mask away
Welcome to the anteroom of death

Gambling riders pull the strings
Pull them tighter let them in
Burn your fingers
Trade a dream
coming in, coming in, coming in, coming in

Come and play another day
Throw your mask away
I don't care what you say
Cause your lovely words decay
Come and play another day
Welcome to the anteroom of death
