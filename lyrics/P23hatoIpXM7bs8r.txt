You take your time while you are driving
While the words are speeding circles in your head
And daylight breaks on the horizon
But you won't turn to face the shadows that you left

So be a man about it
See, a woman can be tough

I won't break
So say what you gotta say
And I won't fall
I didn't need you anyway
And you won't try
And you won't fight
Already wasted all my time
No, I won't break
So say what you gotta say

Sunset, the sky is full of colors
As the clouds break into couples and escape
I got your message there in black and white
But the truth is in the words you haven't said

Ooh-oh-ooh, don't sugar-coat it
You see, a woman can be tough

I won't break
So say what you gotta say
And I won't fall
I didn't need you anyway
And you won't try
And you won't fight
Already wasted all my time
No, I won't break
So say what you gotta say

Say it, say it
Say it, say what you gotta say
Say it, say it
Say it, say it

Let's cut out all the small talk
Tell me what I already know
Don't you dare think I'm not strong enough
You're gonna have to let me go
(Say it, say it, say it, say it)
(Say it, say it, say it, say it)

I won't break
So say what you gotta say
And I won't fall
I didn't need you anyway
And you won't try
And you won't fight
Already wasted all my time
No, I won't break
So say what you gotta say

Say it, say it
Say it, say what you gotta say
Say it, just say it
Say it, say what you gotta say
