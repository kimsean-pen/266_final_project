Now we're alone, idly chit-chatting away
Could we lower the tone?
Lower the tone
Lower the tone
Touch me
I'm done with conversation babe, let all your inhibitions lay low
Could we lower the tone?
Lower the tone
Lower the tone

We've got nothing else to say
Don't make me give the game away
Take me like you want me, babe
I'll be yours and that's okay
Shower me with kisses
The way your breath against my skin makes
the hairs on the back of my neck stand tall
Feel like I've not felt before now

Now we're alone, show me something no one else knows
Could we lower the tone?
Lower the tone
Lower the tone
Touch me
I'm done with complications babe, just let our situation unfold
Could we lower the tone?
Lower the tone

We've got nothing else to say
Don't make me give the game away
Take me like you want me, babe
I'll be yours and that's OK
Shower me with kisses
The way your breath against my skin makes
the hairs on the back of my neck stand tall
Feel like I've not felt before now

Lower the tone so I can love you more
The lower you go, the more I am yours
'Cause your dark side is beautiful
Yeah, your dark side is beautiful to me
Lower the tone so I can love you more
(To me, you are an animal)
The lower you go, the more I am yours
(Sensitive and wonderful)
'Cause your dark side is beautiful
(You make me feel incredible)
Yeah, your dark side is beautiful
(Together we unravel)

Boy, you lock and you load
Deliver me all of your loving
Boy, you lock and you load
Deliver me all of your loving

Now we're alone, idly chit-chatting away
Could we lower the tone?
Lower the tone
Lower the tone
