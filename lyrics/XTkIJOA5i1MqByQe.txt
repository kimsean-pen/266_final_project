Bullet to a target
Bullseye, watch it die
Bullet to a target
Heart crossed twice
Caught in a lie
Bullet to a target
Bullseye, watch it die
Bullet to a target
Heart crossed twice
Caught in a lie

All of this can fade away at any time
All of this can fade away at any time
Right now you're happiest when you're alone
Right now you're happiest when you're alone
Right now you're happiest when you're alone
Right now you're happiest when you're alone

Pulling on your conscience
Driving with the sunlight in your eyes
Feelings are fleeting
Rearview mirror, reckless mind
You are light from a fire
I am standing too close
You are light from a fire
I am standing too close

All of this can fade away at any time
All of this can fade away at any time
Right now you're happiest when you're alone
Right now you're happiest when you're alone
Right now you're happiest when you're alone
Right now you're happiest when you're alone
Right now you're happiest when you're alone
Right now you're happiest when you're alone
Right now you're happiest when you're alone
Right now you're happiest when you're alone
