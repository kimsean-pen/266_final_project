Out on the tar plains, the glides are moving,
all l looking for the new place to drive.
You sit beside me, so newly charmingg,
sweatening dew drops glistenn,
freshing your side.

And the sun slips down bedding heavy behind,
the front of your dress all
shadowy lined.d.

And the droning engine throbs in time
with your beating heart.

Way down the lane away, living for another day,
the aphids climb up in the
drifting haze.e.

Swim seagull in the sky, towards that hollow
western isle,
my envied
lady holds you fast in her gaze.

And the sun slips down bedding heavy behind,
the front of your dress all
shadowy lined.d.

And the droning engine throbs in time
with your beating heart.

And the sun slips down bedding heavy behind,
the front of your dress all
shadowy lined.d.

And the droning engine throbs in time
with your beating heart.

Sing, blue silver.

And watching lovers part, I feel you smiling,
what glass splinters
lie so deep in your mind?

To tear out from your eyes
with a word to stiffen brooding lies.

But I'll only watch you leave me further behind.

And the sun slips down bedding heavy behind,
the front of your dress all
shadowy lined.d.

And the droning engine throbs in time
with your beating heart.

And the sun slips down bedding heavy behind,
the front of your dress all
shadowy lined.d.

And the droning engine throbs in time
with your beating heart.

Sing, blue silver.

Sing, sing, blue silver.
