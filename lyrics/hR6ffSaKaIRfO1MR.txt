You might be in pieces but let's call it something else
Let's say that you are your own disco ball
It sounds better, more promising
It doesn't just sound like you're broken
But what, but what breaks is the light shines on you
You break it away and point it at someone else
While your insides stay darkened
The blackest black, nothing can penetrate there

They say that your, your broken heart is visible from the outside
I say it just needs that you contain multitudes
There is not one interpretation that will hold you
Like I can hold you

You will not be awake for long
You will not be awake for long
We'll meet in the smallest great unknown

This is the long sleep, this is the long sleep
This is the long sleep, this is the long sleep
This is the long sleep, this is the long sleep
This is the long sleep, this is the long sleep
This is the long sleep, this is the long sleep
This is the long sleep, this is the long sleep
This is the long sleep, this is the long sleep
This is the long sleep, this is the long sleep
This is the long sleep, this is the long sleep
This is the long sleep, this is the long sleep
This is the long sleep, this is the long sleep
This is the long sleep, this is the long sleep
This is the long sleep, this is the long sleep
This is the long sleep, this is the long sleep

There should be something I could tell you
There should be something I could
say directly without lyrics and melody
Maybe that's what I'm trying here
Something else than lyrics or melody
Do you hear it?
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
It's not in the words
It's not in the rhythm
It's not in the rhythm
It's not in the words
