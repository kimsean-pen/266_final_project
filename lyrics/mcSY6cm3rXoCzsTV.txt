You're the Northern Wind
Sending shivers down my spine
You're like fallen leaves
In an autumn night

You're the lullaby
Singing me to sleep
You are the other half
You're like the missing piece

Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
You don't know
What you do to me

You are all four seasons
Rolled into one
You're like the cold December snow
In the warm July sun

I'm the jet black sky
That's just before the rain
Like the mighty current
Pulling you under the waves

Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
You don't know
What you do to me

I'm the darkest hour
Just before the dawn
I'm slowly sinking
Into the the slough of despond

Like an old guitar
Worn out and left behind
I have stories still to tell
Of the healing kind

Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
If I could just find you tonight
If I could just find you tonight
Oh my love

Do do do
