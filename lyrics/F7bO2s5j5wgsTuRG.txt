Off in the distance the church bell rings and the raven spreads his wings
Shadows of steel fall silent in the gloom one last full moon
The future is lost payment for the crime there's no way out this time

[Chorus:]

No sound from the gallows no sound from the shadows tall
Only silence till morning only silence till churchbells toll
No sound from the gallows

You feel the cold of the stone below your feet now your sorrow is complete
Have your last meal water and bread as the last rites are read
A new dawn approaches take your last breath you are one step from death

[Chorus]

Up to the steps mobs cheer you on who will cry when you're gone
Bound hand and foot the hood is in place pray for God's holy grace
Off in the distance hear the churchbell ring now the angels will sing

[Chorus]
