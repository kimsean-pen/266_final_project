And for love's sake, each mistake
Ah, you forgave
And soon both of us learned to trust
Not run away, it was no time to play
We build it up and build it up and build it up

And now it's solid
Solid as a rock
That's what this love is
That's what we've got, oh, mmm

Solid
(Oh)
Solid as a rock
And nothing's changed it
(Ooh)
The thrill is still hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

Oh, oh, oh, ah

You didn't turn away
When the sky went gray
Somehow we managed
We had to stick together
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

You didn't bat an eye
When I made you cry
We knew down the line
We would make it better
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

And for love's sake, each mistake
Ah, you forgave
And soon both of us learned to trust
Not run away, it was no time to play
We build it up and build it up and build it up

Now it's solid
Solid as a rock
(Ooh)
That's what this love is
(Oh, oh)
That's what we've got
(Oh, oh)
(Yes, it is)

Solid
Solid as a rock
And nothing's changed it
(Oh)
The thrill is still hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

Oh, oh, oh, ah

Gone with the wind
Another friend
Got in between
Tried to separate us
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Oh, knock-knock on wood
You understood
Love was so new
We did what we had to
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

And with that feeling
We were willing to take a chance
So against all odds, we made a start
We got serious, this wouldn't turn to dust
(Ooh)
We build it up and build it up and build it up

And now it's solid
(Ooh)
Solid as a rock
That's what this love is
(Oh)
That's what we've got, oh
(Oh, oh)

Solid
(Yes, it is)
Solid as a rock
(Ah)
And nothing's changed it
(Ooh)
The thrill is still hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

Solid
(Oh)
Solid as a rock
(You know it)
(Well)
(You know it, baby)
Solid
Solid as a rock
(Lovin' me, lovin' me, oh)

Solid
(Don't leave me, baby)
Solid as a rock
(Well, well, why, why)
(Oh)
Solid
Solid as a rock
(Every day it gets sweeter, now)
(Ooh)

Solid
(You know I like it)
Solid as a rock
(Good, good, well, it's good, good, good)
Solid
(Solid, solid, solid, solid, solid)
As a rock
