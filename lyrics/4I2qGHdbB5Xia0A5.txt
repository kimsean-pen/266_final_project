The world outside don't like us much
'Cause they ain't got our classy touch
But they ain't good enough to breathe
This town's good air, we make 'em leave

But it's no, no, no, really can't do that
No, no, no, down home town

No monkey business in this town
Well, who do you think you're pushin' round?
This town's respectable and clean
Just look around, you'll see what I mean

But it's no, no, no, really can't do that
No, no, no, down home town

Down home town
Down home town
Down home town
Down home town
Down home town
Down home town

But it's no, no, no, you really can't do that
No, no, no, down home town

We got the best town band around
Just listen to their crazy sound
When they get hot, they gonna blow
You see them winning every show (Wish I was in a Land of Dixie)

(Look away, look away, look away, look away)

Down home town (Gotta get down, gotta get down)
Down home town (Gotta get down, gotta get down)
Down home town
Down home town (Oh, I think they're coming down now)
Down home town

But it's no, no, no, (No) you really can't do that
(She likes you) No, no, no, (I can't do that) down home town

(Wish I was in a Land of Dixie)
(Look away, look away)
