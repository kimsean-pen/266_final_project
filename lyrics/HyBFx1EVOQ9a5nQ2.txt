Walk tall beneath these trees boy
you monolith not scarred by fallout
us wolves were right behind you and lucifer will never find you
oh no!

The moon, let it guide you,
when selene comes,
we'll alll know how to fight

Dear fenrir, my saviour, come and eat the ones,
we know who taste the best

I know just where you've been boy,
I've watched you by the stream
and don't be afraid of the dark
'cos the darkness is simply a womb for the lonely
swallow your pride and walk with us through the trees and hills
oh yes! your english eyes they are turning red
I I I I oh I I I I

The moon, let it guide you
and I shall find you a home in our heartland,
a heart in our homeland
Until the moon is down, until the moon is down
