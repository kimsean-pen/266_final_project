I've been walking backwards
Listening to your word of mouth
Your secret's wide open
And mine has slithered out

Make your bed or nothing at all

Excess, you sit sideways
And you dance a crooked dance
Excess, you are evil
Dressed for church and holding hands

Make your bed or nothing at all

I wanna be your late-night crisis line
I wanna give you all a piece of mind
I wanna be your late-night crisis line
I wanna give you all a piece of mind

I've been walking backwards
Listening to your word of mouth
Your secret's wide open
And mine has slithered out

Make your bed or nothing at all
