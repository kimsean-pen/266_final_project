You were attractive once before,
Before you indulged yourself.
Firing on board thoughts, becoming,
Becoming someone else.
I watch you choking on the stuff,
The stuff you pretend to have liked.
You think I'm stupid oh,
We were close.

We were close,
We were close as hell.

You mug yourself as well,
Amazed that you can't tell.
Well frankly I'm just disappointed,
I just get disappointed.
I liked you like you were,
A loser I prefer.
Well frankly I'm just disappointed,
I just get disappointed.

I was so angry 'til I saw you,
I saw you with your dad.
Trying to be like him,
But you're better.
But still you make me mad as hell.

You mug yourself as well,
Amazed that you can't tell.
Well frankly I'm just disappointed,
I just get disappointed.
I liked you like you were,
A loser I prefer.
Well frankly I'm just disappointed,
I just get disappointed.

Wanted to be something new,
When you should've just been you.

You make me mad as hell,
You mug yourself as well.
Amazed that you can't tell,
But frankly I'm just disappointed.
I just get disappointed.

I liked you like you were,
A loser I prefer.
Well frankly I'm just disappointed,
I just get disappointed.

You mug yourself as well,
Amazed that you can't tell.
Well frankly I'm just disappointed,
I just get disappointed.
