Am I insane?
I ask myself over and over and over again
Flies in my brain
Pouring out from the cracks in my skull
Am I alone?
Surrounded by sin and
I think I might just be suffocating
The devil came to take me to hell
But I'm already there.
Am I insane?
Am I insane?
Am I insane?
The devil came to take me to hell
But I'm already there.
I won't let you be the death of me
No, I refuse to let you bring me down (bring me down)
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong
I know I've lost my mind before
But now I'm back
And I'm better than ever
Am I insane?
I fold myself over and scream 'til I'm spitting blood
Flies in my brain
The itching is incomprehensible and it won't stop
Am I alone?
The voices grow fainted
But they just won't fucking go away
The devil came to take me to hell
But I'm already there
Am I insane?
Am I insane?
Am I insane?
Am I alone?
Surrounded by sin
I think this might just be the end
Am I insane?
Am I insane?
Am I insane?
The devil came to take me to hell
But I'm already there.
You can't take this away from me
You can't relieve these demons
You can't make this OK for me
You're ones who caused these feelings
I apologize for what I'm about to do
I tried to sympathize
But at the end of the day
You brought this on yourself
I won't let you be the death of me
No, I refuse to let you bring me down (bring me down)
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong
I know I've lost my mind before
But now I'm back and I'm better than ever
Now I'm back and I'm better than ever
The tears
Have left a blur
That I can't explain
The pain has left a hole
In which my heart should have been
I'm blind with rage
And I can't shake this feeling
Irrational, Impetuous, Intemperate
I'm blind with rage
And I can't shake this feeling
Irrational, Impetuous, Intemperate
I won't let you be the death of me
I refuse to let you bring me down (bring me down)
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong
I know I've lost my mind before
But now I'm back
And I'm better than ever
