It's so damn easy when you're down
To push them all the way
It's so damn easy when you're cold
And I wish that things could be the same
It doesn't work that way
And I wish that we were only tame

And none of us shall run
You're in my heart and my head, I'm here
Pulling around my head, I'm here

It's so damn easy when you're down
To push them all the way
It's so damn easy when you're cold
And I wish that things could be the same
It doesn't work that way
And I wish that we were only tame

And none of us shall run (And I know I should run)
You're in my heart and my head, I'm here
Pulling around my head, I'm here

Wait a second, wait a second
