Sometimes I've got nothing to say.
Nothing to sing about,
That makes you lie awake.
Sometimes I've got nothing to do.
Nothing to signal out when I can't be with you.

How should I hold this girlfriend?
As tight as I ever could?
Now, why should I?
No reason why.
You wore me down worse.
Did I show?

Show me something good.
Show me something.

Sometimes I am nowhere to be found.
If it is just a bed, then why the ringing sound?
Sometimes we've got nowhere to be.
Nothing to talk about.
And nothing to agree on.

How should I hold this girlfriend?
As tight as I ever could?
Now, why should I?
No reason why.
You wore me down worse.
Did I show?

How should I hold this girlfriend?
As tight as I ever could?
Now, why should I?
No reason why.
You wore me down worse.
Did I show?
