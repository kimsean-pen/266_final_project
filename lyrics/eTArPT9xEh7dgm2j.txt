Ooh, ooh...
Oh make me wanna say
Yeah, yeah
Oh boy you make me say

Something about you makes every girl hot
Suffering without you
I just want a taste of what you got
But my mama always told me not to

Play with those players who play you til there's no more
Game left to be played
Look at what you got me going through
Can't help myself, because

You make it look good
(make it look good)
Say you make it look good
(make it look gooder than them other fools)
Around you I know I ain't supposed to be
Acting like I know you notice me
Fantasise about the way you lick your lips
Fingertips on my hips as we dip
Oh, boy you make it look good (make it look gooder than them other fools)

Baby baby sometimes, I need you
But I feel so shy
Simply, can't leave you
'Cause them other girls are gonna try
Guess their mama never told them not to

Play with those players who play you til there's no more
Game left to be played
Look at what you got me going through
Can't help myself

Because you make it look good (make it look good)
Said you make it look good
(make it look gooder than them other fools)
Around you I know I ain't supposed to be
Acting like I know you notice me
Fantasise about the way you lick your lips
Fingertips on my hips as we dip
Oh, boy you make it look good (make it look gooder than them other fools)

(Whooooah)
Ooh boy
(And it makes every girl high)
Make me go high
Oh boy you make me say
Ooh, ooh you
Now my mama said don't play with them players
No, no
Look at what you got me going through
Fantasise about the way you lick your lips
(Baby, baby, baby)
Oh, it's gooder than them other boys
Yes, it is
