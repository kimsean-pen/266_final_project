Powdered pride in a jar near your bed
save it up, save it up for the death of loneliness
caution tape around the scars that still bleed for me
for me

who knows?

tones the shape of surprise
every voice is paralyzed (don't talk)
animals don't beg like you do, like you do, like you do?

who knows?

incidental love is all around

who really knows about 23, you and me, 33, dirty dreams?

every night
