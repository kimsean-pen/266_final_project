Liberate... My madness!
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate... My madness!
I just want to
Liberate... My madness!
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate... My madness!
Section off myself
Put a wall up, what the hell have I done?
Keep the dog at bay, survive by saving me!

Values in the game
Not a fuck-up, not a part of your lie
I am one, I am all - I'm above and beyond!
Stand off of the shit

Back off or I'll spit
So soft, you forget
(Your garbage in is garbage out)
You just don't give a shit

I won't play the fit
Get off, get on this
(Your garbage in is garbage out)
Liberate my madness

Liberate... My madness!
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate... My madness!
I just want to

Liberate... My madness!
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate... My madness!
I am not ashamed

What is vital, isn't always humane
You can't break in vain
But you can't break away!
Even in my face
Lotta bullshit, not alotta the truth
I can't see from here
But I can smell your fear!
Back off of the shit

Stand off or I'll spit
So soft, you forget
(Your garbage in is garbage out)
You just don't give a shit

I won't play the fit
Get off, get on this
(Your garbage in is garbage out)
Saved - You're such a slave - I don't expect a name

You don't care - I wasn't witness
I can't be a part of a system such as this
Hard eyes - Glow right - In my - Darkness - Again
With the sickness, renegade sisters, blisters
Salivate, litigate, liberate, madness, sadness
Fuck this - How long have I had this?

I don't need this - Outta my business!
Insert, engage, betrayed, my God!
Fraud!
Fraud!
Fraud!
Liberate... My madness!
Liberate... My madness!
I just want to
Liberate... My madness!
Liberate... My madness!
