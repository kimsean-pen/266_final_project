Round and round
Round and round (round)
Round and round

You see me standing there and act like you don't know me
But last night you were calling me saying you want me
Oh why you always make me feel like I'm the one that's crazy
You got my heart racing, my, my heart racing
Boy, I need you here with me, we can't go on this way
I've fallen hard for you, all I can say

We're goin' round and round, we're never gonna stop goin'
Round and round, we'll never get where we're goin'
Round and round,
well you're gonna miss me 'cause I'm getting dizzy goin'
Round and round and round

You try to pull me close and whisper in my ear
You always tell me lies, I've cried out all my tears
I push my feelings to the side but then you bring 'em
Bring-bring 'em back, now you got me singing
Boy, I need you here with me, we can't go on this way
I've fallen hard for you, all I can say

We're goin' round and round, we're never gonna stop goin'
Round and round, we'll never get where we're goin'
Round and round,
well you're gonna miss me 'cause I'm getting dizzy goin'
Round and round and round (Round and round)

Love me or love me not, I'm staring at the clock
I pick them flower petals off and then I watch them drop
Love me or love me not, I'm staring at the clock
I pick them flower petals off and then I watch them drop
Boy, I need you here with me, we can't go on this way
I've fallen hard for you, all I can say

Round and round, we're never gonna stop goin'
Round and round, we'll never get where we're goin'
Round and round,
well you're gonna miss me 'cause I'm getting dizzy goin'
Round and round and round

Round and round, we're never gonna stop goin'
Round and round, we'll never get where we're goin'
Round and round,
well you're gonna miss me 'cause I'm getting dizzy goin'
Round and round and round and round and round

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
