You've been on my mind
I grow fonder everyday
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows
Why it's taken me so long
To let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want

I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know
If you never try
To forgive your past
And simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
Promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me a chance
To prove that I'm the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
You lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know
How it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose you'll go

I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know
If you never try
To forgive your past
And simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me a chance
To prove that I'm the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

I know it ain't easy, giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy, giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy, giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy, giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy, giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy, giving up your heart

So I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me a chance
To prove that I'm the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
Come on and give me a chance
To prove that I'm the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
