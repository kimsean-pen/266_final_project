Ohh, huh
Ohh, huh
Ohh, huh

I met him in the Bahamas, I love that nigga per-sona
Smoke that nigga marijuana, get freaky, call me Madonna
Lay on the bed, he follow, bone him until to-morrah
Make him sing high sopran-ah, AHHHHHHHH!
Fifty-fo'-fifty-fifty, Mr. Act-Super-Kinky
Baby, what you gon' get me, is a rings for my lil' pinkie
Money will multiply, 'fore you run up inside
Make me all weak and tired, mmhmmm

You got-ta (scream)
If you up in the club, you think you tearin' it up
You got-ta (got-ta) (scream)
Well, pour most of the liquor, then you watchin' people buzz
You got-ta (got-ta) (scream)
If you from outta town, you think you're holdin' it down
You got-ta (got-ta) (scream)
You got-ta, oh, you got-ta

He say he from Puerto Rico, he told me to call him Chico
Freakin' up in the Nico, my ego got really negro
Throw the heat, throw heat, be bold, though I'm like dice in cee-lo
Makin' him scream and moan, AHHHHH! Send 'em back home
Boy is it really worth it? Just to get dirty dirty
Give me the liquor liquor, you make me talk slurry slurry
Your money will multiply, before you come up inside
Get me all weak and tired, mmhmmm

You got-ta (scream)
If you up in the club, you think you tearin' it up
You got-ta (got-ta) (scream)
Well, pour most of the liquor, then you watchin' people buzz
You got-ta (got-ta) (scream)
If you from outta town, you think you're holdin' it down
You got-ta (got-ta) (scream)
You got-ta, oh, you got-ta

He asked, could he rock my body, he also asked could he buy me
A drink six-oh Ferrari, then ride up in my safari
Shit, what a deal, word up, how much it cost now?
Shit, what the deal, word up, how much it cost?
Play your position, listen, where is your pot to piss in?
'Fore we start really kissin', hot as freaky kitchen
Hey, what the deal, word up, how much it cost now?
Hey, what the deal, word up, how much it cost now?

You got-ta (scream)
If you up in the club, you think you tearin' it up
You got-ta (got-ta) (scream)
Well, pour most of the liquor, then you watchin' people buzz
You got-ta (got-ta) (scream)
If you from outta town, you think you're holdin' it down
You got-ta (got-ta) (scream)
You got-ta, oh, you got-ta

Ahhhh! (scream)
If you up in the club, you think you tearin' it up
You got-ta (got-ta) (scream)
Well, pour most of the liquor, then you watchin' people buzz
You got-ta (got-ta) (scream)
If you from outta town, you think you're holdin' it down
You got-ta (got-ta) (scream)
You got-ta, oh, you got-ta
