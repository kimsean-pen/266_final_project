You'll never figure this out
This is the reason the world
Is filled with doubt

You'll never figure this out
This is the reason the world
Won't shut their mouth
Shut your fucking mouth
Shut your fucking mouth

Who the fuck do you think you are?
I am willing to listen
But I'm not willing to follow these hollow words

They kill, they rape
They destroy everything
Stop wasting your life
Telling me when I'll lose mine

Your words will be erased
When I seal your mouth
And pull your tongue right
Through your throat

We are the ones who control our lives
Never let them decide
When we will meet our demise
We refuse these lies

You'll never figure this out

Who the fuck do you think we are?
How can you sit there and tell us
When we will die, then it fails us again

You bleed, we bleed
What's the point of these lies?
Stop wasting your life
Telling me when I'll lose mine

You'll never figure this out
You'll never figure this out

How can you be one with the dead?
How can you be one with the dead?
How can you be one with the dead?
How can you be one with the dead
When you're split in fucking two?

How can you be one with the dead?
How can you be one with the dead?
How can you be one with the dead?
It's better left unsaid

We are the ones who control our lives
Never let them decide
When we will meet our demise
We refuse these lies

Who the fuck do you think you are?
You imprison your death but we know you're a liar
Stop wasting your miserable life
You'll never be one with the dead
