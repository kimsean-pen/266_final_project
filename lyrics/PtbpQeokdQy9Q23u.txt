Here comes the book
the book of rules
if you play this game
you won t stay the same
you could win your golden teeth
be a spinning top
use a riding crop
Mr. Alphabet says
"smile like a weasel
as I cover you...
cover you in treacle"
we all know impatience
is a sin. so do as you re
told to do, it s SO rewarding to...
and you could win the tin man s heart
be a chiming clock
lie on the chopping block
Mr. Alphabet says
"give me all your money
just to cover you
cover you in honey"
Don t be afraid
There s no marmalade
Don t be afraid
I wouldn' t even dream of it!
