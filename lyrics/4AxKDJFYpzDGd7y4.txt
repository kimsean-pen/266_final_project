I dedicate my life to something richer
and all the things that come
cuz thats no price at all
and I know you'll be there
and i want you to know I care because

keep your head up, hold your head up even though
its a cruel world
count your blessing you won't need them when you're gone
its a cruel world
you can't see it you can't see it even though
its a cruel world

we're thrown into this life no raft no savior
masked in self contempt and wrapped in cotton cloth
and its just like a prayer
the way you showed me you care to be there and because

keep your head up, hold your head up even though
its a cruel world
count your blessing you won't need them when you're gone
its a cruel world
you can't see it you can't see it even though
its a cruel world
