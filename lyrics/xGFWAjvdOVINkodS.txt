Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah

Tryin' times, is what the world is talkin' about
You got confusion all over the land, yeah
Mother against daughter, father against son
The whole thing is gettin' out of hand

But folks wouldn't have to suffer
If there was more love for your brother
But these are tryin' times, yeah, yeah

You got the riots in the ghetto, and it's all around
A whole lot of things that's wrong is going down, yes, it is
I don't understand it from my point of view
I remember somebody say do unto others
As you'd have them do unto you

And then folks wouldn't have to suffer
If there was more love
But these are tryin' times, yes, it is

People always talk about man's inhumanity to man
But what you tryin' to do to make this a better land?
Oh, just pick up your paper, turn on your TV
You see a lot of demonstrations for equality

But maybe folks wouldn't have to suffer
If there was more love
But these are tryin' times, yeah

Tryin' times, yeah, is what the world is talkin' about
You got confusion all over the land

Mother against daughter, father against son

The whole thing, is getting out of hand
