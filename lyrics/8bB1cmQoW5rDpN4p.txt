Everything within its place
I've been stuck in mine for days
Stuck in my own ways
Confusing rust with age
I think I've lost my taste for change
Taste for change

I've been lying to myself and everybody else
Trying to shake the rust that's kept me planted to the shelf
I've been hiding in plain sight with nothing left inside
Leave me for the meanwhile and I swear I'll be alright

Another day, I sit and wait
The clock face driving me insane
Because the hands don't hesitate
Confusing rust with age
I think I've lost my taste for change
Taste for change

Misguided and unfazed
For nothing more than to save some face

I've been lying to myself and everybody else
Trying to shake the rust that's kept me planted to the shelf
I've been hiding in plain sight with nothing left inside
Leave me for the meanwhile and I swear I'll be alright
I swear I'll be alright
