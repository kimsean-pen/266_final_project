I was five and you were six.
We rode on horses made of sticks.
I wore black. You wore white.
You would always win the fight.

Bang bang, you shot me down.
Bang bang, I hit the ground.
Bang bang, that awful sound.
Bang bang, my baby shot me down.

Seasons came and changed the time.
I grew up, I called you mine.
You would always laugh and say,
"Remember when we used to play?"

Bang bang, you shot me down.
Bang bang, and I hit the ground.
(Bang bang) That awful sound.
Bang bang, my baby shot me down.

Music played and people sang.
Just for me the church bells rang.
After echoes from a gun.
We both vowed that we'd be one.

Now you're gone, I don't know why.
Sometimes I cry
You didn't say, "Goodbye."
Didn't take the time to lie.

Bang bang, you shot me down
(Bang bang) and I hit the ground.
(Bang bang) That awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down.

(Bang bang)
You shot me right between the eyes.
You meant to paralyze.
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
Oh, oh, baby, I'm laying on the ground.
I ain't never going down.
Bang, bang.
Oh, baby, oh, baby, come on back to me.
You'll see how sweet it's gonna be.
Bang bang.
Oh my baby, my baby shot me down.
