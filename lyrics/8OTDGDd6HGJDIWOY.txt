If you wanna leave baby
I won't beg you to stay
and if you gotta go darling
maybe it's better that way
I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna be fine
don't worry about this heart of mine
just walk out that door
yeah see if I care
go on and go now.

Don't turn around
cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me crying
just walk away
it's tearing me apart
that your leaving
i'm letting you go
And I won't let you know baby.

I won't miss you arms around me
holding me tight
if you ever think about me
just remember i'm gonna be alright
i'm gonna be strong
i'm gonna be fine
don't worry about this heart of mine
i know i'll survive
sure i'll make it through
and i'll even learn to live without you

Don't turn around
cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me crying
just walk away
it's tearing me apart
that your leaving
i'm letting you go
And i won't let you know
