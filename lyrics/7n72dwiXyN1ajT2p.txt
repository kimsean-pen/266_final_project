When I repent that I'm the cover of the magazine
And even thought I know it's all what I wanted
I wish to be, beheaded by a guillotine
Make me regret that I'm part of the scene

I am the man, I am the man, I am the madman
I ride the bullet of your everlasting fantasies
I cannot take it, take it, cannot take it anymore
Making me forget my dream

You cannot run
You cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday
Try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury

You cannot run
You cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday
Try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury

I'm disappointed I can't get enough adrenaline
Like Yngwie said it you unleashed the fucking fury
I'm crushing Slayer, Corey Taylor like a beat machine
Making you forget they're part of the scene

You wish you had 9 to 5 instead of copying me
You do your soilwork and yet you adore me
I said it in your face I'm your arch enemy
Stop what you're doing and run

You cannot run
You cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday
Try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury

You cannot run
You cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday
Try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury

Growlgod
Growlgod

I am your god, I am no saint, I need no Jake E
I am the posters on your wall, that's why I set you free
Who is Elize? I have no clue, 'cause all I see is me
Make me forget that I am a part of team

I understand that you are hating my philosophy
The guys behind me ain't no band, they are slaving for me
I cannot fake it, fake it, cannot fake it anymore
The fury, the growl god I roar

You cannot run
You cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday
Try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury

You cannot run
You cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday
Try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury
