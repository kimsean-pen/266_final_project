It's clearly plain to see
The sun is breaking through the clouds
I'm falling through a dream

I'm looking out from the plane
The fields look like that patch for clothes
You left out in the rain

I remember how to love
But I forget what it was
It echoes and toys in my mind

And I'm heading home tonight
I'm heading home
Home...

Oh it's clearly plain to see
The sun is breaking through the clouds
I'm falling through a dream

I remember how to love
But I forget what it was
It echoes and toys in my mind

And I'm heading home tonight
I'm heading home
Home...

Home...
Home...
