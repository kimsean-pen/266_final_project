Calling all of the roots
Saves us all
While the fire is hot
Bathe in all the glow
Bathe in all the fire
Close your mind
Could be worse
To have never hurt
For now
Who knows for tomorrow
Fire to ash
Present to past

Bathe in the fire
Close your mind
Could be worse
To have never hurt

Calling all of the roots
Save us all
While the fire is hot
Bathe in the glow
Bathe in the fire
Absolve your soul
So that
You don't
For now
Who knows for tomorrow
Fire to ash
Present to past

Bathe in the fire
Close your mind
Fail we may
Sail we must
