I could be your artist then
I would trace lines from the sun across the sides
Or be the poet in my tune
And pull my heart out in each verse I give to you

I'll be the stranger in the dark
The one you pray for in the night that holds a spark
Or be the honest love you seek
Casting words out like a stone from cheek to cheek

Oh, it's a lie, what's the world coming to?

For you
Know they'll love your name
And every heart you break
There'll be somebody new, for you
And every time you die
A million ways inside
I'll always be a fool for you

I'll be the farmer in the field
If you should want to plant the seeds and watch 'em yield
Oh I could be the crook, the thief
The one who'd steal what you desire in your sleep

Oh, it's a lie, what's the world coming to?

For you
Know they'll love your name
And every heart you break
There'll be somebody new, for you
And every time you die
A million ways inside
I'll always be a fool

The only locks upon the door
Are from the pie so why'd you look there for?
There's nothing there you'll ever need
Just call out for me

And all the love remains
Every heart I break
There'll be somebody new, for me
And every time I die
Strung out by the night
I'll always be a fool
