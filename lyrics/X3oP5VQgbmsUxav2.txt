A Shepherd with her lonely flock
She leads the blind beast onward
Never a moment for fear
Never a moment of doubt

Carrying her wisdom in the soil
The garden speaks silent words
In the tune of the wind
To the beat of the rain

A lonely echo that comes screaming through time
Now grown silent, yet so loud in the dark
Words that once sent me to sleep
Words that once set me free

Trying to grasp that moment of oblivious existence
Once constant, unmoving, eternal

The feeling of satin
Still warm and soft against my skin
Taking your hand I walk you through the garden one last time
Before the final dawn as time runs faster
Touch my skin and recite the lullaby with me until the end of time
