Nightmare
Have we gone too far?
Is this really the same dream, I'm reborn
And it's so paralyzing
To live it all again

We live too long for our purpose
We repeat ourselves in this cursed domain
Do we hold on to something?
Something we could never retain?

Living in fear of the ones who created the sun

Can you hear the choir of the night
They're singing the anthem of our lives
Save ourselves from this nightmare
And see the moon as it shines
Would you believe in a night
That is compelling in our sight

I fear what I've become
Is there a way to reverse this
Curse all the lies that grow
From their mouth
From their minds

Line our minds with seeds
So we can grow from within
And see what we really dream

I'm lost in this dream
Can you hear them scream?

Can you hear the choir of the night
They're singing the anthem of our lives
Save ourselves from this nightmare
And see the moon as it shines
Would you believe in a night
That's compelling in our sight

Make them see that we
Bathe my soul in blood
Curse this sanctuary
It's all hopeless

Blood bearer
We are the antidote
For the wretched souls
Blood bearer
We are the dream

Their songs echo through the night
And I can hear for the first time
My life through their eyes
It will lead me out of this
Nightmare, will you be there?
Be there for me through the night
And I will meet you on the other side, the other side

From the beginning
The night fills with blood
We can live it all again
Just know that there's no end

Face of the liar
Shine bright in the dark
Do we know ourselves?
We are the night
