You send me just colors
I'm waiting, don't hold back

Trees bow to the wind and
I'm falling inside you

Slide in, feel the future
Rushing slowly, right now

So close, could touch it
I'm dreaming, don't wake up

Slide in, feel the future
Rushing slowly, right now

Nothing makes me feel like
Show me real love, right now

You send me just colors
You send me just colors

Slide in, feel the future
Rushing slowly, light now

Nothing makes me feel like
Show me real love, right now
