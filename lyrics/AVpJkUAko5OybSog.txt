Will you sign my
Taste

Am I really all the things that are outside of me?
Would I complete myself without the things I like around?
Does the music that I make play on my awkward stage?
Do you appreciate the subtleties of taste buds?

My friend and me were having laughs
In a living room filled with arts and crafts
He said "I like their clothes and their china plates
But what I really want is a simple place
With no flashy clothes 'cause you can't eat those"

Only Ma'd pretend to like the clothes you showed to me
Something in my heart can tell me it's a weakness
Maybe you would have more luck playing those tasty games
But me, I called and called and never heard from her again

She's too good to share our favorite things
I'll keep an open mind if you let me in
Don't let your temper rise, don't get a bitter face
Try not to judge me on my kind of taste
And don't go changing clothes when they don't like yours

Am I really all the things that are outside of me?
