All around me I see what weakness has made
Too much tomorrow I think I'll take all today
Am I a poison? am I a thorn in the side?
Am I picture, perfect subject tonight?

I don't need nobody
I don't need the weight of words to find the way
To crash on through
I don't need nobody
I just need to learn the depth or doubt
Of faith to fall into

Here I slumber to awaken my daze
I find convenience in this savior I save
Am I a prison? am I a source of dire news?
Am I a picture, perfect reason for you?

I don't need nobody
I don't need the weight of words to find the way
To crash on through
I don't need nobody
I just need to learn the depth or doubt
Of faith to fall into

In this time of substitute
It's my needs I've answered to all the while
And the hope that I invest
Still turns to signals of distress all the while

I don't need nobody
I don't need the weight of words to find the way
To crash on through
I don't need nobody
I just need to learn the depth or doubt
Of faith to fall into

You're all I need
Yeah, and the water runs deep
Yeah, you're all I need
Now, I cry myself to sleep
You're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need
