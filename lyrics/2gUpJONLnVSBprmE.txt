When I saw you over there
I didn't mean to stare
But my mind was everywhere

I wanna know you
Gonna guess that you're the kind
To say what's on your mind
But you listen when I have something to show you

There's a mark above your eye
You got it in July
Fighting for your sister's reputation

You remember people's names
And valentines are lame
So you bring me flowers just for no occasion

I wanna know you

I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
Sit back and say to myself

"Yeah, I thought so"

You smile, never shout

You stand out in a crowd
You make the best of every situation
Correct me if I'm wrong

You're fragile and you're strong
A beautiful and perfect combination

I wanna know you
I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know

And maybe someday down the road
Sit back and say to myself
I like how you are with me

In our future history

And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself
"Yeah, I thought so"

I wanna know you
I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself
I like how you are with me
In our future history
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself
"Yeah, I thought so"
