Behold
Children of Cain
All beings not of reptilian form
Be upon them
Spare none
Mercy cast aside!
Those who feareth not my sacred blade shall be blessed

Repent not
Thou art man
God is no more
Rise now above the weakness of flesh
Come forth
Join ye the arsenals of blasphemy
Follow the One who spurred Roman warring legions

Rise up o power from sea below all seas
Sirius
Draconis
Awake from everlasting dream
spirits of abomination
formless Thou hath appeared before me
I am before all things

Chthonic gods
Those from beyond the stars
Commander of hosts
Devour the flesh of man
May their weapons melt like wax
May their tongues be torn apart
May Apophis grind their bones
May their ashes be scattered all around

Hail Satan

Hear me o vermin
How couldst Thou fall so low
Redemption through denial
Restriction becomes a sin
Mankind
So pure
Castrate Thy impotent god
Vomit forth the blasphemy
And forever shalt Thee
win
