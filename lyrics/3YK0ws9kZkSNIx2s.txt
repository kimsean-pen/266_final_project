Hold me when I'm laying down with you
It's 4AM and we're both drunk
You look at me right in my eyes and tell me it's forever
You make me remember
You make me remember you
You're not like the others
You are, you are the perfect fit
You got it yeah, you go and
And make everything disappear
You take me to your space
Here I know, you are, you are
You are, you are are
You are, you are the only one
The only one for me, for me
This won't be like any other time
Always feels brand new with you
You know exactly what I like
You know just what to do
You make me remember
You make me remember you
You're not like the others
You are, you are the perfect fit
You got it yeah, you go and
And make everything disappear
You take me to your space
Here I know you are, you are
You are, you are are
You are, you are the only one
The only one for me, for me
We fall so deep into the night
Where I'm not afraid
I'mma fly
Here I know you are, you are
You are, you are are
You are, you are the only one
The only one for me, for me
