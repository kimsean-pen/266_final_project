In time, you will find
Many things found in the ordinary
Could it be, what you see
Many things are extraordinary

Every time when I look at you
Well I seem to find another thing behind the story
Every time when I look at you
Well I seem to find another dream behind the glory

And now it seems no time at all
The sundial wonders
How could you see nothing at all?
The sundial wonders on

Took a walk in the park
Walkin' all around in the after hour
Sometimes beneath the light
To take away all your love and power

Every time when I look into
Well I seem to find another scene behind the story
Every time when she looks at you
Well I seem to find another dream behind the glory

And now it seems no time at all
The sundial wonders
How could you see nothing at all?
The sundial wonders on

And now it seems no time at all
The sundial wonders on
