brothers
sisters
listen closely
to the earth
dawn arrives
a rooster wails
clouds enshroud the mountainside
like a virgin's bridal veil
summer nights
silent trees
fireflies
like galaxies
encircled by
black butterflies
up the road
side by side
down the valley
come raging storms
dying just as fast as
they are born
on summer nights
among the trees
fireflies
like galaxies
taking flight
upon the breeze
butterflies
of ebony
