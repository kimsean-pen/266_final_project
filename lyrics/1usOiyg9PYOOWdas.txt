Feels like I'm falling,
Into a world.
Into a world,
I can't control

I hear it calling,
Down in my soul.
Gripping my bones,
It won't let go.

Wake me up,
Won't you wake me up.
I'm caught in a bad dream,
Caught in a bad Dream.
Wake me up,
I wanna feel the sun.
I'm caught in a bad dream,
Caught in a bad dream.

Feels like I'm frozen,
Nowhere to run.
Nowhere to run, from here.
These walls are closing,
Closing me in.
Wearing me thin, with fear.

Wake me up,
Won't you wake me up.
I'm caught in bad dream,
Caught on a bad dream.
Wake me up,
I wanna feel the sun.
I'm caught in a bad dream,
Caught in a bad dream.
I'm caught in a bad dream,
Caught in a bad dream.

Wake me up,
Won't you wake me up.
I'm caught in a bad dream,
Caught in a bad dream.
