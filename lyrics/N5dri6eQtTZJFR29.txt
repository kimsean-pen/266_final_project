Scornful, relentless memory
Ripped of all but drive
Undressed by betrayal
Zero tolerance for the souldead
Wish I was the violence,
Inflicted upon you

Fuel for hatred, air raid siren
Fuel for hatred to mankind

Little you,
still like a claw in my eye
Pulsating organic rage
I should have let you off of the hook
Mind drifts
Into dynamic pain
Universal onslaught
I'm on my own (one soul, one hate)

Fuel for hatred, air raid siren
Fuel for hatred to mankind

Damnation, holocaust
Devil horns for you to ride
Time for the angel
To spread his wings and fly
World opponent,
Wishmaster of gruesome pain
Stormtroops' frantic fury,
Demoniac spitfire!

Abortion of religious life, distinguish the rot
I hate you
To a level of intoxication
Don't feel alone,
I've got enough
I wish you slow death,
Slow death by grinding

Fuel for hatred, air raid siren
Fuel for hatred to mankind
