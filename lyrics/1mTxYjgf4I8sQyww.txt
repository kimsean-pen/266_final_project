Kill the light, cauterize the blood of Christ
Born to die, lost in his judgment, your god is a lie

Defend the light avoid the truth,
then hide behind the fable of the son of God
The point of death, uncertainty,
unheavenly obsession with the make-believe
For which you are, have been deceived,
there is no gates to heaven or eternity
A noble stane for me you pray,
I am the blood of darkness and cannot be saved

Deprecation, soul is taken, one with Satan

Dance with the Devil in the circle of blasphemy
Bathe in the innocent blood
Stand on the cross of a lord who don't give a shit
Deface the image of God
Tribulation, no salvation, unforsaken

What you believe I dispute to the end, unbound by the gospel of woe
No one is safe from the lies of lord,
confiding with death and stripped of virtue
Under the light I see, and an ocean of suffering
Go to him, in the end,
you'll see there's nothing waiting for you only death

Begging for mercy from something that's not
No mercy given and none to be got
Faithless assumption impaled on the cross
Contradiction the infliction of God

Defend the light avoid the truth,
then hide behind the fable of the son of God
The point of death, uncertainty,
unheavenly obsession with the make-believe
For which you are, have been deceived,
there is no gates to heaven or eternity
A noble stane for me you pray,
I AM A THORN of darkness that cannot be saved

Deprecation, soul is taken, one with Satan
