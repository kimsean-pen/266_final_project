I've fallen on my own regret,
Building towers from my love.
Your claws around my throat again,
All I am is not enough.
Tell me that there's something left,
I'm a coward and a cub,
We try so hard but stay bereft,
Mm, I'm broken up.

I don't know where you go,
But I know you so well,
When I'm alone with you, alone with you.
I don't know who you are,
When you're with your friends,
I can only lose.

It doesn't matter what we said,
Leave the flowers in the dust,
I can't remember what it meant,
Only that I wrote for both of us.
I've fallen on my own regret,
Building towers from my love.
Your claws around my throat again,
All I am is not enough.

I don't know where you go,
But I know you so well,
When I'm alone with you, alone with you.
I don't know who you are,
When you're with your friends,
I can only lose.

Won't you tell me that I'm more than just my chemicals,
I've been thinking and it's more than just electrical.
