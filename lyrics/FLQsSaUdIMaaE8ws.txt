You can't get to me
You're just another sucker
And I won't waste another second with you
I rather use that time on me
And for what really matters
Build up my own big castle
You're just a mother fucker

A waste of time, yeah
Get out of my bubble
Don't mess up my mind, yeah
You make me puzzled
And you crossed the line
I'll be flexin' muscles
And then you will find
That you are in trouble

I won't listen to your shit
I won't take no- none of it
I won't listen to your shit

I won't listen to your shit
I won't take no- none of it
I won't listen to your shit

You can't get to me
You're just another sucker
And I won't waste another second with you
I rather use that time on me
And for what really matters
Build up my own big castle
You're just a mother fucker
You're just another sucker
You're just another

I'd rather use that time on me
And for what really matters
Build up my own big castle
You're just a mother fucker

Don't lose my shit
I'm no cinderella I said deal with it
Got my umberella
I can work with this
Smooth like nutella, don't go play your tricks
You're just a story teller

I won't listen to ya'
I won't take no- none of it
I won't listen to ya'
(I won't listen to ya')

I won't listen to ya'
I won't take no- none of it
I won't listen to ya'

You can't get to me
You're just another sucker
And I won't waste another second with you
I rather use that time on me
And for what really matters
Build up my own big castle
You're just a mother fucker
You're just another sucker
You're just another

I'd rather use that time on me
And for what really matters
Build up my own big castle
You're just a mother fucker

I won't listen to ya'
I won't take no- none of it
I won't listen to ya'

I won't listen to ya'
I won't take no- none of it
I won't listen to ya'

You can't get to me
You're just another sucker
And I won't waste another second with you
I rather use that time on me
And for what really matters
Build up my own big castle
You're just a mother fucker
You're just another sucker
You're just another

I'd rather use that time on me
And for what really matters
Build up my own big castle
You're just a mother fucker
