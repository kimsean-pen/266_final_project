See me coming from beyond the mortal light
Flying high on the wings of the cursed time
Here it comes like a deadly thunderstorm
Decimating my enemies at dawn
Here I stand and draw a line - my existence remains undivine
Predator of the rising sun, for I fear no one
Ruler of the open steppe, vultures flying upon my path
Blood of lions - rushing thru my veins
Pumping the coldness of my heart
Blood of lions - rushing thru my veins
I death or victory, isolated integrity
Blood of lions - rushing thru my veins
Blood of lions
Here I come at the speed of a murderer sound
Riding fast on the wings of an infernal war
In my world only evil glorifies, the ways of chaos to purify
Procreated on a killing ground, animalized baptized in blood
My britherhood i defend and fight for
I praise no lord - my destination is eternal war
Blood of lions - Blood of lions
Ruled by the madness of vindication, collector of countless assassinations
In a mortal dawn of punishment, thru the valley of pale death
The breed of my foes I devour and despise, born to be cruel, not kind
Here I stand and draw a line, my existence remains undivine
