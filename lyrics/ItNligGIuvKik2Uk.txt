Here it ends
Noone's gonna shed a tear
No need to shout
Just to stand the silence

Well spent time
In the early morning haze
You sit and wait
Watching full glasses through blank eyes

This is not
What you wanted
Not
What you had in mind

This is not
What you wanted
Not
What you had in mind

Vacuous winter stare
Worn out version of yourself
To tough to fall
But not strong enough to turn
But not strong enough to turn

This is not
What you wanted
Not
What you had in mind

This is not
What you wanted
Not
What you had in mind

This is not
What you wanted
Not
What you had in mind

This is not
What you wanted
Not
What you had in mind
