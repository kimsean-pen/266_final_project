Something about it seems so meant to be
Something about it's so twenty-first century
Waiting in line for the time when a spark will show
The night in my blood will take control

We go burning into the night
Never did it feel so right
Couldn't slow down now if we wanted to

Burning down the same tracks we're gonna collide, we go
Burning down the same tracks we're gonna collide
Burning down the same tracks we're gonna collide
We're gonna collide

Picking up speed headlong into the night
When out of the darkness comes the guiding light
Burning down the same tracks I'm heading straight for you
Down the same tracks you been burning too

We go burning into the night
Never did it feel so right
Couldn't slow down now if we wanted to

Burning down the same tracks we're gonna collide, we go
Burning down the same tracks we're gonna collide
Burning down the same tracks we're gonna collide
We're gonna collide

Burning down the tracks cause you know I want you
Burning down the same tracks you know I need you
Burning down the same tracks going straight into the night
Burning down the tracks, Burning down the tracks
Burning down the tracks, Burning down the tracks

Burning down the same tracks we're gonna collide, we go
Burning down the same tracks we're gonna collide
Burning down the same tracks we're gonna collide
We're gonna collide
