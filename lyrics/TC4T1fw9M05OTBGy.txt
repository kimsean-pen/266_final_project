These colors will not change
You change the way I see them
These words will fade
When you explain why you hate them
We are the same

She keeps repeating (she keeps repeating)
all that she needed
She says she's right here, (she says she's right here)
she seems so distant

Saying goodbye this time, the same old story
Seeing you cry, makes me feel like saying sorry

Just a few last hours, we gotta make this count
We're counting backwards
(Just a few last hours, we gotta make this count)
We're falling forwards.

She keeps repeating (she keeps repeating)
all that she needed
She says she's right here, (she says she's right here)
she seems so distant

Saying goodbye this time, the same old story
Seeing you cry, makes me feel like saying sorry

Saying goodbye this time, the same old story
Seeing you cry, makes me feel like saying sorry

Saying sorry we're falling apart
Wish we knew this from the start
Saying goodbye's the hardest part
Wish we knew this from the start

Saying goodbye this time, the same old story
Seeing you cry, makes me feel like saying sorry

Saying goodbye this time, the same old story
Seeing you cry, makes me feel like saying sorry

Saying goodbye this time, this time
Seeing you cry, makes me feel like saying sorry
