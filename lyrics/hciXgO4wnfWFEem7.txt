We be up on a late night
Talking 'bout this n that
We just chit-chat
Listen while I lay back

If you ain't belling my line
Boy you still play on my mind
You know I'm feeling your vibe
It's like you're here with me all of the time

I tell you what I want
You never get me wrong
Let's keep the conversation going on and on
We could say a lot of things, a lot of ways
But everytime I know
You love me when you whisper through the phone

Handsfree when you speak to me
Your words flow in like poetry
Everytime I answer your call
Your voice is like the sweetest touch
I don't plan on hanging up
I know it's love whenever you call
You whisper through the phone
You whisper through the phone

And you're making me love, boy
When you comfort the white noise
I love it when you talk me to sleep
Sounding like a lullaby to me

If you ain't belling my line
I'll stay awake through the night
Waiting in till the AM
I'll be here waiting till you call again

I tell you what I want
You never get me wrong
Let's keep the conversation going on and on
We could say a lot of things, a lot of ways
But everytime I know
You love me when you whisper through the phone

Handsfree when you speak to me
Your words flow in like poetry
Everytime I answer your call
Your voice is like the sweetest touch
I don't plan on hanging up
I know it's love whenever you call
You whisper through the phone

Formation of ideas and pictures of us
Anticipation of what the future holds for us
Are you feeling it too?
Could this really be love?
This could really be love

Handsfree when you speak to me
Your words flow in like poetry
Everytime I answer your call (your call)
Your voice is like the sweetest touch
I don't plan on hanging up
I know it's love whenever you call
You whisper through the phone
You whisper through the phone
