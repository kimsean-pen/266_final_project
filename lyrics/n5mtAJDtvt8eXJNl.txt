Time pulls me further, hard to breathe
But harder to love
Time finds another waiting to see
If it's coming for us
But when the light falls upon the water
Showing me that we have this love to fight for
And all the clouds need these days to trust you
I'm afraid the fall couldn't get much higher

When the storm comes right above us
Let the trust that you'll keep me undercover
When the rain starts to drag us under
Promise me that we'll fight on together

Uuh uuh uuh uh
Till the storm is over
Uuh uuh uuh uh
Till the storm is over

Come back and wonder why we believed
We could be stopped?
'Cause we have each other, it's never easy
But it's right for us
'Cause when the light falls upon the water
Showing me that we have this love to fight for
And all the clouds need these days to trust you
I'm afraid the fall couldn't get much higher

When the storm comes right above us
Let the trust that you'll keep me undercover
When the rain starts to drag us under
Promise me that we'll fight on together

Uuh uuh uuh uh
Till the storm is over
Uuh uuh uuh uh
Till the storm is over
