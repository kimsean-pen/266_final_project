I got razor sharp mind that wants to cut you down
A little place of mine maybe I could let you down
Pony up, we got a ways to go
Set me up my friend, we're running low

Oh, if you take my hand I'm gonna get you outta here
The crushing bottles breaking and the swinging chandelier
In a round of bullets and blood and snow
I saw the midnight come and I watched her go

In a round of bullets and blood and snow
I saw the midnight come and I watched her go
I watched her go,
I watched her
I watched her go,
I watched her go
