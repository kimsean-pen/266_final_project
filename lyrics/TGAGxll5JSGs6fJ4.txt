Why are you so scared and creeping around,
taking photographs all over town,
pictures in the dark that live in the light,
the world is my playground too and I'll do what I like.
Why are you so scared of falling apart,
intimidating me for falling apart,
stay on your knees with your cross and don't tell me you know so,
the world is my playground too and I refuse to follow.
Fly with me falling through the night,
fly with me falling out of sight, find me hold me in your arms,
'cos I'm scared of their controlling crowds keep me calm,
'cos I'm scared of their controlling crowds here they come.

Why are we so obscure and creeping around,
hiding from mirrors and screens all over town,
objects disturbing blinding taking the peace in me,
the world is my kingdom too and I'll feel what I like in me.

Killing my heart, I can't face,I can't face no more
Killing my heart, I can't face,I can't face no more
Killing my heart, I can't face,I can't face no more
Killing my heart, I can't face,I can't face no more
Killing my heart, I can't face,I can't face no more
Killing my heart, I can't face,I can't face no more
Killing my heart, I can't face,I can't face no more
Killing my heart, I can't face,I can't face no more

The world is my playground too I can't feel anymore.
Fly with me falling through the night,
fly with me falling out of sight,
find me hold me in your arms,
'cos I'm scared of their controlling crowds keep me calm,
'cos I'm scared of their controlling crowds here they come.
Why are we so cold and breaking apart,
caught up in this storm just breaking apart,
pictures and colours I loved but don't see anymore,
the world is my playground too I don't feel anymore,
why are you so adored,
'cos I'm scared of their controlling crowds here they come
'cos I'm scared of their controlling crowds here they come
'cos I'm scared of their controlling crowds here they come
'cos I'm scared of their controlling crowds here they come
