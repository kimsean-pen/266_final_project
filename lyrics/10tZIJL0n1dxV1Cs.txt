Yeah, yeah

I got this vision in my mind
You got me sinning with desire
You got my heart at double time
And I'm not putting out this fire

Call me any time that you want
Send for me you know I'll come over (babe right here)
Hit me when you're ready to go
Love me 'cause I like and I want ya
Ooh, put, put, put, put it on me
This woman, woman, woman, woman, woman
Wants you bad

(I want you over my skin)
'Cause I like it when you touch me
(I don't know where to begin)
Do nasty things and you don't judge me
(Say it again and again)
You got that something that undoes me
(I want you over, over, over, over and over)

There's nothing wrong with being bad
You know that's what you like about me, mmm
Just run your fingers down my back
Go 'head and feel up on my body, ooh baby

Because I'm owning what's mine
Confident, I know I look good babe (too damn good)
That you can handle my shine
Love me in the way that you should, babe
Ooo, put, put, put, put it on me

This woman woman woman woman woman
Wants you bad

(I want you over my skin)
'Cause I like it when you touch me
(I don't know where to begin)
Do nasty things and you don't judge me
(Say it again and again)
You got that something that undoes me
(I want you over, over, over, over and over)

Love me (ooh ooh)
Just make me love, love me
Touch me (oh ooh)
I wanna feel you on me
I want you over my skin
Say it again and again, woo!

(I want you over my skin)
'Cause I like it when you touch me
(I don't know where to begin)
Do nasty things and you don't judge me
(Say it again and again)
You got that something that undoes me
(I want you over, over, over, over and over)
Oh yeah, I want you over my skin!
