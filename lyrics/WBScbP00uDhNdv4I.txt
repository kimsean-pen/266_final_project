I've been throwing stones
At a wall that won't fall down and I'm sick of being alone
If I try at your window would you come round
Right now
Look out for me
Can't you come round
Right now
Be here with me
Can I count on you
To pull me up
When it's too much
Can I count on you
Cause without us
I don't know what I would do
You're running through my head
You're running through my head all night
Can I count on you, you, you
You've been blowing smoke
In the air and it lingers there
Are you holding on or letting go
Cause I need to know would you come round
Right now
Look out for me
Can't you come round
Right now
Be here with me
Can I count on you
To pull me up
When it's too much
Can I count on you
Cause without us
I don't know what I would do
You're running through my head
You're running through my head all night
Can I count on you, you, you
When I come back home
Will the lights be on
Are you there, are you there?
If I lose control
Will you keep me close
Are you there, are you there?
When I come back home
Will the lights be on
Are you there, are you there?
If I lose control
Will you keep me close
Are you there, are you there?
Can I count on you
To pull me up
When it's too much
Can I count on you
Cause without us I don't know what I would do
You're running through my head
You're running through my head all night
Can I count on you, you, you
When I come back home
Will the lights be on
Are you there
(Can I count on you? Can I count on you)
If I lose control
Will you keep me close
Are you there
(Can I count on you? Can I count on you)
You're running through my head
You're running through my head all night
Can I count on you, you, you
Can I count on you?
