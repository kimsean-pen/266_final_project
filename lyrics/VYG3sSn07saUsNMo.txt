I thought some time alone
Was what we really needed
You said this time would hurt more than it helps
But I couldn't see that

I thought it was the end
Of a beautiful story
And so I left the one I love at home to be alone, alone

And I tried and found out this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you
Than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm
Than safe and warm by myself

I'd rather have hard times together
Than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Yeah

And then I met someone
And thought she could replace you
We got along just fine
But wasted time because she was not you

We had a lot of fun
Though we knew we were faking
Love was not impressed with our connection built on lies, on lies

So I'm here 'cause I found this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you
Than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm
Than safe and warm by myself

I'd rather have hard times together
Than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Who holds my heart

I can't blame you if you turn away from me like I've done you
I can only prove the things I say with time
Please be mine, please be mine

I'd rather have bad times with you
Than good times with someone else
(I know)
I'd rather be beside you in a storm
(Anytime)
Than safe and warm by myself
(Surely, surely, baby)

I'd rather have hard times together
Than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart

I'd rather have bad times with you
(Surely)
Than good times with someone else
(Surely)
I'd rather be beside you in a storm
(Oh yeah)
Than safe and warm by myself
(All by myself)
I'd rather have hard times together
Than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Who holds my heart
