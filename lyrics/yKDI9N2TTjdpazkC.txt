Could you stay a little longer?
I could really use the extra time
I don't know why I even care
Cause I'm never really there
I'm sure he must be a real nice guy
What a relief, He'll carry you to sleep

Hey!
And I don't know (Hey!)
What we could have done (Hey!)
And maybe this time I will learn to love again (Hey)
I will always be your friend

See this is why
We don't talk anymore
Cause you'll always be waiting
To settle the score
And every second could be the next meltdown
If I wasn't leaving you wouldn't make a sound
You wouldn't make a sound

So this is why
We don't talk anymore
So this is why
We don't talk anymore

Now I don't have to be a real nice guy
What a relief

Hey!
And I don't know (Hey!)
What we could have done (Hey!)
And maybe this time I will learn to love again (Hey!)
I will always be your friend

Could you stay a little longer?
I could really use the extra time
I don't know why I even care
Cause I'm never really there
I'm sure he must be a real nice guy

Could you stay a little longer?
Could you stay a little longer?
Could you stay a little longer?
Could you stay a little longer?
