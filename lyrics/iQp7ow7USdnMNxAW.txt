I can see that you are leading her on
I think I know what you are
I can see that you are leading her on
I know what you are

You can't see that you're just the same as all the stupid people you hate
I'm not saying I'm free from blame because I need all the friends I can get

A long distance call to a mystery blond it wasn't good for business
But you say that she cries when she hears the bird's song
You want to soothe her distress

You can't see that she's just the same as all the stupid people you hate
I'm not saying I'm free from blame because I need all the friends I can get

Can't you see that you are leading her on
You say you're feeling listless
The people are tired and commitment has gone
To this I've been a witness

You can't see that I'm just the same as all the stupid people you hate
I'm not saying I'm free from blame because I need all the friends I can get
I need all the friends I can get x6
