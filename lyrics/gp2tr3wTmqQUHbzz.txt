You know it (know it, know it)
When it's over (over, over)
Doors are closing (closing, closing)
Feel the sober (sober, sober)
Staring at you (at you, at you)
You know you'd better take one last good look

One more round then it's bottles to the ground
Smashing of the glass what a supersonic sound
Gotta pull the plug when it's time to die
A wo-o wo-o wo-o
Bottles to the ground

Theres a suitcase (suitcase, suitcase)
On the sidewalk (sidewalk, sidewalk)
Theres some records (records, records)
In a milkcrate (milkcrate, milkcrate)
She'll be staying (staying, staying)
You'll be throwing whiskeys over one lip

One more round then it's bottles to the ground
Smashing of the glass an imperfect perfect sound
We gotta pay the piper when the rats are gone
A wo-o wo-o wo-o
Bottles to the ground

One more round then it's bottles to the ground
One more round then it's bottles to the ground
... (you get the idea) ...

One more round then it's bottles to the ground
