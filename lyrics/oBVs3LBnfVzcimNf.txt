This emotional disturbance began
The other night, the other night
When I could not get the door open
Because it had been locked from the outside
Because it had been locked from the outside

I wailed and turned into a demon, turned into a demon
Slamming my body against the frame
Muscling the door knob
Until it was loose in its socket
And my blood was dripping on the floor, was dripping on the floor
And my blood was dripping on the floor
