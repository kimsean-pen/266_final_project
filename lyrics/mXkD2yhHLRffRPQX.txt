So tell me Slim what you wanna do
When you know I'm in love with you
Every time that I turn around
Look for you but you can't be found

Fly free baby, fine with me
I'm in love with a bumble bee
Ooh Slim boy, you killing me
But you so sweet to me

Honey, you so sweet
Sugar, gone a long way to catch you
You so sweet
All I gotta do is add a little lemon
You my favorite drink
You make me think
Honey, you so sweet

So tell me Slim what it's gonna be
It don't be like this usually
When it come to the, "What it do?"
I don't fall for that, "Woop-tee-woo"

Boy, can you tell me please?
Wanna know if you feeling me
Slim boy, you killing me
But you so sweet to me

Honey, you so sweet
Sugar, gone a long way to catch you
You so sweet
All I gotta do is add a little lemon
You my favorite drink
You make me think
Honey, you so sweet

You got that honey, you running from me
You really turn me on
You got that honey, stop acting funny
You really turn me on

So tell me Slim what you trying to do
I'm tryna get me your interview
Look for you all over town
But you gave me the run-around

Fly free baby fine with me
I need to know, is you feeling me?
Can you stick your pinky finger in my tea?
'Cause you're so sweet to me

Honey, you so sweet
Sugar, gone a long way to catch you
You so sweet
All I gotta do is add a little lemon
You my favorite drink
You make me think
Honey, you so sweet
Honey, honey, honey, say

You got that honey, you running from me
You really turn me on
You got that honey, stop acting funny
You really turn me on

You got that honey, you running from me
You really turn me on
You got that honey, stop acting funny
You really turn me on
