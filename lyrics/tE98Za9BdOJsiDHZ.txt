WE HAVE TO FIND A BETTER WAY
OUT OF THIS TRAGEDY
AS THE BATTLE RAGES ON
BLOOD STAINS THE GROUND WE'RE ON
MY EARS HEAR ONLY SCREAMS
BRAVE SOLDIERS ARE DYING
ONE SPARTAN STANDS ALONE AND SHOUTS
THIS WAR IS OURS
THIS WAR IS OURS

Yes, I will see you
Through the smoke and flames
On the frontlines of war
WE HAVE TO FIND A BETTER WAY
And I will stand my ground until the end
Till we conquer them all
WE HAVE TO FIND A BETTER WAY

THROUGH THE FIRE AND THE FLAMES
A SEA OF DEAD, DRIVES MEN INSANE
WE MARCH THE FIGHT INTO THE COLD
THIS IS AS FAR AS IT WILL GO
THE BATTLE ENDS ON TOP OF HERE
THIS IS WHERE WE CONQUER FEAR
ON BLACKOUT ARMED WITH OUR SWORDS
THIS WAR IS OURS
YEAH
THIS WAR IS OURS

Yes, I will see you
Through the smoke and flames
On the frontlines of war
WE HAVE TO FIND A BETTER WAY
And I will stand my ground until the end
Till we conquer them all
WE HAVE TO FIND A BETTER WAY
Till we conquer them all

Yes, I will lead you
Through the smoke and flames
On the frontlines of war
And I will stand my ground until the end
Till we conquer them all
We will conquer them all
We will conquer them all
We will conquer them all

THIS WAR IS OURS
YEAH
THIS WAR IS OURS

Yes, I will see you
Through the smoke and flames
On the frontlines of war

And I will stand my ground until the end
Till we conquer them all

So I will fight my battle till I fall
And I conquer them all
Till we conquer them all
GO, YEAH
THIS IS WAR (WAR, WAR, WAR, WAR, WAR, WAR, WAR)
THIS IS WAR
