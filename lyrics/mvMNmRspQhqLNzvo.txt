It's in my scent
There's something that could pick up
I turn around
And the whole world is banned for me
If I didn't tire all the places I wanna forget
So we're down, we're down

February easy we're in
Had an easy we're out
If every step, up, had a lower step down
When I feel it, you can feel it
So we're down, we're down

Too much for my love to be left lonely
If only, true love, spreading in the veins
If only, too hard for my love to be left lonely
If only, true love, spreading in the wings, if only
Only, if only

Some days have never been said
If little lines in the sand could come for me
And the rain not easily to forget
So we're down, we're down

It's in my scent
There's something that could pick up
I turn around
And the whole world is banned for me
When I feel it, you can feel it
You can feel it

If I set you free
And you actually came back to me

Too much for my love to be left lonely
If only, true love, spreading in the veins
If only, too hard for my love to be left lonely
If only, true love, spreading in the wings, if only
Only, if only
