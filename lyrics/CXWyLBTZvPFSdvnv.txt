When they finally come to destroy the earth
They'll have to go through you first
I bet they won't be expecting that
When they finally come to destroy the earth
They'll have to deal with you first
And now my money says they won't know about the
Thousand fahrenheit hot metal lights behind your eyes

Invincible (oh-oh-oh)
You're Invincible
Oh-oh
Invincible (oh-oh-oh)
You're Invincible
That crushing, crashing, atom-smashing, white-hot thing it's...
Invincible

When they finally come, what'll you do to them?
Gonna decimate them like you did to me?
Will you leave them stunned and stuttering?
When they finally come, how will you handle them?
Will you devastate them deliberately?
'Cause I'm gonna guess they won't be prepared for
Thousand fahrenheit hot metal lights behind your eyes

Invincible (oh-oh-oh)
You're Invincible
Oh-oh
Invincible (oh-oh-oh)
You're Invincible
That crushing, crashing, atom-smashing, white-hot thing it's...
Invincible

So please use your powers for good.
So please use your powers for good.

You're invincible!

Invincible (oh-oh-oh)
You're Invincible
Oh-oh
Invincible (oh-oh-oh)
You're Invincible
That crushing, crashing, atom-smashing, white-hot thing it's...
Invincible
