Disarm the settlers

The new drunk drivers
Have hoisted the flag
We are with you in your anger
Proud brothers
Do not fret
The bus will get you there yet
To carry us to the lake
The club is open
Yeah, The club is open
Hey, the club is open
A-come on, come on
The club is open
C'mon, c'mon
The club is open
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
The club is open...
