Starting with the affirmation of man
I work myself backwards using cynicism
(the time monitor, the space measurer)

I live sweat but I dream light years,
I am the tide - the rise and the fall
the reality soldier, the laugh child,
the one of the many, the flame child
(the time monitor, the space measurer)
