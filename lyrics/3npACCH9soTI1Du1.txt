Back in Nagasaki
I got married to Cho Cho San
that was her name
In those days
and I was her man.
I'm going back to visit her
she got a problem

She got a little Cho Cho
Cho Cho San was her name

And this is her tale of woe
take it away Cho Cho.
Today's the day that I see clear
A tiny thread of smoke appears

Where blue skies border on the ocean and a ship is set in motion.
All the while I sing this song
I see a dot on the horizon

Growing bigger every second gleaming white in my direction.

Who on Earth can it be coming up the path for me?
What on Earth will he say
shall I run to him or run away?
Freaking out he's come to get me
my feet are stuck and just won't let me.
Run to him do I dare
Madam Butterfly
don't blow it.

Calling Butterfly
Madam Butterfly

That's the name he used to give me
He's my man 'til the day I die.
Oh sweet Butterfly
So sweet Butterfly
She's waiting

He'll be back
I have faith in this love track.

Pinkerton's the name
Lieutenant Colonel Pinkerton Sir
U.S. Navy
I'm a bounder
I married a Yankee girl
But I went back to visit old Japan
where there she was
Cho Cho San.

Gotta have something to believe in
My white honky
I do miss him.
Someday soon he'll come around
Just to stop my nervous breakdown.
Call me fool! Call me stupid!
Bend this arrow
kill this cupid.
Say it with me
He'll be back
I have faith in this love track.
Calling Butterfly
Madam Butterfly
That's the name he used to give me
He's my man 'til the day I die.
Oh sweet Butterfly
So sweet Butterfly
She's waiting
He'll be back
I have faith
Little sweet
sweet Butterfly
I hear him crying faintly

He thinks I'm still his sweet sixteen
I guess I'll tease him gently.
Calling Madam Butterfly
his angel plucked right from the sky
Hide my baby in strange places
I feel the fear that I might die.

Right in his arms and his embraces softly kissing my eyelashes

Got no right
no right to doubt it
ain't no doubt
no doubt about it.
Call me fool! Call me stupid!
Bend this arrow
Kill this cupid.
I have faith I'll always pray
My white honky's here to stay.
Call me Butterfly
Madam Butterfly

Butterfly
Butterfly
have no fear
I'll be back to wipe your tears.
Oh sweet Butterfly
so sweet Butterfly
she's waiting.

I will wait for him with unshakable
faith. He'll be back - He'll be back.
