[?] touch you made, we're fading away
Like footprints out in the snow
Quietness and freedom are killed in the flesh
But one of your destined calls

I let your mind games in
Let your mind games in
Let your mind games in again
I let your mind games in
Let your mind games in
Let your mind games win again

Wrote that you take when I'm caught in your stream
You're cold when I'm in your plate
The rule that you break is hope and relief
Warmth when I am away
(If I let her go)
You've come for more
(But if I let her in)
You take control

I let your mind games in
Let your mind games in
Let your mind games in again
I let your mind games in
Let your mind games in
Let your mind games win again

Life keeps on running through my veins
Life keeps on running through my veins
Life keeps on running through my veins

Game on
I am ready for it all
Game on
'Cause when I'm up, I like to fall

I let your mind games in
Let your mind games in
Let your mind games in again
I let your mind games in
Let your mind games in
Let your mind games win again

Life keeps on running through my veins
Life keeps on running through my veins
Life keeps on running through my veins

I let your mind games in
Let your mind games in
Let your mind games win again
