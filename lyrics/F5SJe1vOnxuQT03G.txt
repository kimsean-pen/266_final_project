Here we go
They're back again
Look alive, warn your friends

We are warm and we are safe
Enjoy it while you can
Before things change

We have got to take cover, brother
We have got to take cover, brother

Lie down in a field if you can
Look at the night sky
Oh, where does it end?

Sometimes it hurts
When you care about me
But it's going to hurt more
When they take you from me

We have got to take cover, brother
We have got to take cover, brother

Here, we go again
Oh, midnight knocks!
Oh, explosions!

Maybe it's all made up in our heads
This happens to me when I'm bored
Or depressed

Here is the best part of the song
Where I admit that I might be wrong
Because if they are good
And if they are right
Then they'll have their rapture
One of these nights
But if they are wrong...

We have got to take cover, brother
We have got to take cover, brother

Here is the best part of the song
Where I admit that I might be wrong
Because if they are good
And if they are right
Then they'll have their rapture
One of these nights
But if they are wrong...
