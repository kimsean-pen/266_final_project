Picked you out my pocket, and you fell into the road
You asked me if I'd make it better
Asked me if we could grow old together
But you don't mean a thing to me
So I'll walk by quite happily
And now I guess that you've moved on aswell

You took me to the bricks
You start to build a wall
Keep peace intact
Protect your family
Keep them from harm
Live peacefully, but they came crumbling down
The second you left town,
And now your family are gone, are gone

Understand me, take me, fully
Underground where I can not be found
Understand me, take me, fully
Underground where I can not be found

And a letter that you wrote
That had been stashed inside my wall
Telling me all about your life
It had been there for a quite a while
It skipped out certain chapters
That I thought had really mattered
And now I feel like I missed out

Out, baby out, get out of town
Baby out, baby out, get out
Baby out, baby out, get out of town
Before it catches up with you
And you cannot withstand
Before it catches up with you
And you cannot withstand
Before it catches up with you
And you cannot withstand
