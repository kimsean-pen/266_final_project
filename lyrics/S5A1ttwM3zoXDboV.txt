Glitter falls on the souls that were saved
A love lies cold and drowned in the waves

Cause you never really took it serious did you?
No you never really took life serious did you?
And I can be your guiding light if you just let me
But I can't be your guiding light if you have left me
If you have left me

The mark you left lies still on the ground
Speaking silence has no sound

Cause you never really took it serious did you?
No you never really took life serious did you?
I can be your guiding light if you just let me
I can be your guiding light if you just let me
If you just let me

Higher higher oooh
Higher higher oooh
Open skies are dawning
Higher higher oooh
Open skies are dawning
Higher higher oooh

Been talking to your ghost all day
Hoping in the same old way
Have you really gone? Have you really gone?
Higher higher oooh
Have you really gone? Have you really gone?
Higher higher oooh
Have you really gone? Have you really gone?

Why does it hurt when my heart misses the beat?

Have you really gone? Have you really gone? (Higher higher oooh)
Higher higher oooh
Have you really gone? Have you really gone? (Higher higher oooh)
Higher higher oooh
Have you really gone? Have you really gone?
Open skies are dawning (Higher higher oooh)
Higher higher oooh
Have you really gone? Have you really gone?
Open skies are dawning (Higher higher oooh)
Higher higher oooh
