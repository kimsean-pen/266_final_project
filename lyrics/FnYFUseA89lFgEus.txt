Well there's a party for me,
the last thing I wanted from you
I close the door behind me and there you are
you seem relaxed and quiet
but under your shirt you sweat
and these balloons around make me feel so sad.

Well there's a feast for me, but it's a night so pale
feels like an empty room where we could kill with words
you wish you could make believe that I'm what you want me to be
but these balloons around make me feel so sad

I'm in your sweet, sweet, sweet embrace
and you're a thousand miles away
your arms a sweet, sweet, sweet embrace
and you're a thousand miles away.

Well there's a party for me
and you know that I didn't ask for it
I just stay in your game I'm just playing your game
so won't you tell me what to do,
I can pretend you tell the truth
won't you tell me what to do,
I can pretend you tell the truth

I'm in your sweet, sweet, sweet embrace
and you're a thousand miles away
your arms a sweet, sweet, sweet embrace
and you're a thousand miles away.
Why? why? Why? Why?

Should I take the blame, where's my big mistake
should I feel happy for what I haven't done
should I take the blame, should I feel the pain
or should I feel regret for what I haven't done
Why? Why? Why? Why?

Was this a feast for me or just a bad surprise?
Should I have expected this? I just don't wanna know
and you've made up the rules so that you'll win this game
but you can't tell me what to do
'cause I don't believe in you

What's left a sweet sweet sweet embrace
and you're a thousand miles away
your arms a sweet sweet sweet embrace
and you're a thousand miles away
Why? Why?
I'll never ask you why... Why.
