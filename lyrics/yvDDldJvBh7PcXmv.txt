All the money in the world couldn't save her from herself
She's such a loner, I can't understand
I go drink with her but now I can't control myself
I get excited, I get upset
But she's such a scream, you know I owe her everything
All us golden children, we owe her everything
But when she gets like this she forgets herself
She hates herself too
She says she doesn't like the way you look or where you're from
And all her underworld officers, they're headed out for the night

Oh, Lord, release me
And turn me over to the wheels of fate
Can she dance?

I know that there a place for us
Can she dance?
I know this worlds not too small for us
Can she dance?
And I could love her if she didn't believe the things she says
Can she dance?
And I could love her if she wasn't scared
Can she dance?
Last night we were staggering home, she was waving her gun around
Screaming into the night

She swung out of the door just like a wrecking ball
I settled the tab, I started following her
I heard her screaming, I heard her screaming down the street
"You know I've never really paid for the things I've done"
I said, "No one ever really does, and of course it's not too late"
Around on the corner I lost sight of her
Crossed the street, caught up to her,
turned around, held her hand, gave her a smoke
She pushed me up against the wall
She said "I'm sick. Get out the sickness"
I held her hair back while she puked
She was saying over and over and over again
"All these underworld officers,
shit, they shoot my sons in the street"

Oh, lord, release me
Oh, lord, release me
And turn me over to the wheels of fate

Can she dance?
Oh, yeah, man, I think you know she can
Can she dance?
But I got hope, I got hope, I got hope that we both can dance
Can she dance?
And I know that there's a place for us
Can she dance?
And in the tower, behind the golden door, she whispered in my ear
She was holding on to my sleeve
"Let's roll, let's get outta here"
So we grabbed some things that looked expensive
Put some beers in her purse and we flew

Baby I got hope for us
Just maybe I believe
Can she dance?
Can she dance?
Can she dance?
Can she dance?
Can she dance?
Can she dance?
Can she dance?
Can she dance?
Can she dance?
