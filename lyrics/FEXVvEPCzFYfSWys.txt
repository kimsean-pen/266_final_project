Our tears don't matter
Our tears don't matter brother
I, I love the life
I love the life I left behind
But you know what I did?
I ripped it apart
There was something in the basement

Not anymore

My ears are ringing

We killed it tonight
We stay awake

So, fuck it all
We killed it tonight
Yeah, we killed it tonight
We stay awake

Yeah, oh
Hm-hm-hm, hm

I never sleep, yeah, hm, hm-hm-hm

We're left behind
Broke, deaf and blind
The kids will unite
And strike up a song

We're left behind
Broke, deaf and blind
The kids will unite
And strike up a song

Fuck it all
We killed it tonight
We killed it tonight
We stay awake

So, fuck it all
We killed it tonight
Yeah, we killed it tonight
We stay awake
