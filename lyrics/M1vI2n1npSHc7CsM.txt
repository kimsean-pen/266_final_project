When we were very young
We were separated
From a story in the center of our heart
Never to know how it ends

And when we met again
In a digital dream
We would seem to be connected with our lifeline
Heavy with wits of a gravity

Hey Big Star, you shine too bright
I'm in love with you, I'm your comet tonight
Swept me away in your blinding sun
We'll melt someday into each other

So every day is spent
Every penny as a sentiment
Heaven only knows what I meant to say
It's better to be with another

Easy for you to say
Would we be lovers in another life?
If all the stars align, and the way we love life
It's nothing short of a miracle

Hey Big Star, you shine too bright
I'm in love with you, I'm your comet tonight
Swept me away in your blinding sun
We'll melt someday into each other

Hey Big Star, you shine too bright
I'm in love with you, I'm your comet tonight
Swept me away in your blinding sun
We'll melt some day, we'll melt some day

Hey Big Star, you shine too bright
I'm in love with you, I'm your comet tonight
Swept me away in your blinding sun
We'll melt some day into each other
