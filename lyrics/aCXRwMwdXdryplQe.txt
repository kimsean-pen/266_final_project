How long now
How long now

I love you
Steel painted eyes
Feels like snow
Change my head
Days so long

You never know
You never know
You never know

You never know
You never know
You never know
Just how long
It will be

Here we go again
We're going round and round
Here we go again
We're going round and round

Today I know
It's too long dare we'll see
Feels like snow
Chained myself to me

You never know
You never know
You never know

You never know
You never know
You never know
Just how long
It will be

Here we go again
We're going round and round
Here we go again
We're going round and round
