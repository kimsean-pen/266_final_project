So it's just another day
Workin' hard don't wait til everything falls into place
Like a face without a name
But history's gonna to change
So it's time to take a stand
Even if you feel the weight of the world now and then
Cause the future's in your hands
So keep on fighting til the end

Come on tear me apart
Rip right through the middle
Put the knife in my heart
We are one
We'll never stop
Look back at everything we are
Undefeatable
Undefeatable

Let it break before you bend
Make it count
Your life is something you have to defend
You could lose or you could win
So keep on fighting til the end

Come on tear me apart
Rip right through the middle
Put the knife in my heart
We are one
We'll never stop
Look back at everything we are
Undefeatable
Undefeatable

I know you're about to break
Don't give up and run away
You know you can be stronger
It doesn't have to be this way
Just say what you want to say
You can't wait any longer

Come on tear me apart
Rip right through the middle
Put the knife in my heart
We are one
We'll never stop
Look back at everything we are
Undefeatable
Undefeatable

Look back at everything we are
Undefeatable
