Like the wondering ghost for a harbor
Like the ground beneath the snow for springtime
Like the believer for something to believe in
Like the drifting castaway for shoreline

I waited for you
All the way through
All the way down the line
I waited for you

I waited for you
All the way through
All the way down the line
I waited for you

I burned out my eyes on the horizon
Sunups in the east and sundowns in the west
I watched them all for just one reason
Sun came up or down, I couldn't care less

I waited for you
All the way through
All the way down the line
I waited for you

I waited for you
All the way through
All the way down the line
I waited for you

I waited for you
All the way through
All the way down the line
I waited for you

I waited for you
All the way through
All the way down the line
I waited for you
