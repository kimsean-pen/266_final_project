Comparisons are easily done once you've
Had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I pick the ripest one
I still got the seed
You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was
Spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

You're like an Indian summer in the middle of a winter
Like a hard candy with the surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said, there's tons of fish in the waters
So the waters I will test
He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth
He pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was
Spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into you're the best

And yes I do regret
How I could let myself, let you go
Now, now the lesson's learned
I touched, and I was burned
Oh, I think you should know

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your
Your eyes, looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
I want you to walk through
And bust in the door and take me away
Oh, no more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay
Stay
