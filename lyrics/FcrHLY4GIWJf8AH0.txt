There's another sucker born
Every minute, Lord
Take her out and pay for a good time
You never know what you can afford

Another wreck and time to collect
More souvenirs
Gone another million miles
No words for the wear

And there's a sucker born
Every other minute, Lord
And he deserves you more
You know I'll only crash this car

I swear to God, I'm wrecking it all
Your happy end
Spin around the block in half the time
I know where you've been

Too bad, you're not feeling too bad
Wanna be my friend
Got another ride you're taking off
Met a General Motor man

And there's a sucker born
Every other minute, Lord
He deserves you more
You know I'll only crash this car

There's a sucker born
Every other minute, Lord I know
He deserves you more
You know I'll only crash this car
You know I'll only crash
You know I'll only crash this car, dear Lord
You know I'll only crash
You know I'll only crash this car
