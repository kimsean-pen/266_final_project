Within isolation, controlled and rebind
Within desolation, is wiped from our eyes
As I speak
I begin to find belief
What was in between
Waits for me

We refuse to live, only sparing breaths
We're caged in silence
We will soon begin
Bringing forth the end to all this madness
Hold me high above the rest
We speak through defiance
We refuse to live in this pattern of death
Return the violence

We refuse to live, only sparing breaths
We're caged in silence
We will soon begin
Bringing forth the end to all this madness
Hold me high above the rest
We speak through defiance
Hold me high above the rest
We speak through defiance

You built up a vice
We will not live caged in silence
There's something contrived
We will not rest, we are the defiant
Rise, out of the rust, out of the wreckage
Polluter of lies, born of the vice, and despair

We refuse to live, only sparing breaths
We're caged in silence
We will soon begin
Bringing forth the end to all this madness
Hold me high above the rest
We speak through defiance
We refuse to live in this pattern of death
Return the violence

Rise
