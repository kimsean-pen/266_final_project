This time I wanna know what life means
To live it again
I'm looking forward, feel the light shine in my eyes
And now I know, my instincts were not wrong
And many things can be done
I don't believe now that I'm dreaming alone

Oh, we're searching for the love
That everyone's got, but can't see, yeah
Oh, beyond the flesh and blood
There's so much hidden behind
As so much more we've gotta give...

Sanity brings up the sadness that keeps your illusions locked
In a little box
Fright comes, you find yourself lonely in a cage of conclusions
Crowding your mind
You! Sit back bowing your head every answer yes-
Why don't you trust me and shed out your fears
Running over the tears you've contained now cover up your eyes
Is it good for you?

I will be here when fire burns!

Welcome on board, over here is the ship of your life
So rotten that will cast away
I'll be your sweet lullaby all the night if you get lost
You can hold my hand

And I'll be here when fire burns (Inside your heart)
Climb up the hills and mountains
Don't forget what you've learned!

Life makes us feel the time we cannot hold
Time makes us live a tale already told
Time makes us heal a feeling inside
A feeling that lies in our heart
That we stole away...

And I'll be here when fire burns (Inside your heart)
Climb up the hills and mountains
Don't forget what you've learned!

Life makes us feel (life makes us feel)
The time we cannot hold
Time makes us live (time makes us live)
A tale already told
Time makes us heal (time makes us heal)
A feeling inside
A feeling that lies in our heart
That we stole away...
