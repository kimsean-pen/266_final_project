Can you blame the sky
When a mama leaves her babies behind
Can you blame the sky
When a mama leaves her babies behind

Can you blame the sea
Oh can you blame the sea
'Cause she's a flowing in that water deep

Is it the dirt that you envy so
'Cause in it her strong roots still grow

No, no, no...

I'll blame those birds flocking so
I'll blame those birds flocking so
Blame those birds flocking so
'Cause with them she's a flying
Oh 'cause with them she's flying

All those mamas are flying
They're watching us from above
They're watching us from above
Dropping their feathers with a mother's love
