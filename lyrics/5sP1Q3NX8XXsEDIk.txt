They say I'm shady
Cause I got another baby
And she keep me up late at night

They say I'm shady
Cause i rarely make the party
But i can't stop hearing her whisper in my ear

You're my one true, you're my one true love
You're my one true, you're my one true love
Feels so right with you in my life
You've been on my mind since i was a yay high

You're my one true, you're my one true
You're my one true, you're my one true love
Feels so high when we go all night
Only satisfied with you by my side

(Ooooh) I, I just wanna I just wanna feel real
(Ooooh) I, I just want to feel real free
I just want to feel real free
So I find it on this beat

They say I'm crazy
Cause no matter what they pay me
I won't leave my love alone

Since I was a baby
This whole world has tried to tame me
But she keep on saying
Won't you come out and play!

You're my one true, you're my one true love
You're my one true, you're my one true love
Feels so right with you in my lane
You've been on my mind since i was a yay high

You're my one true, you're my one true
You're my one true, you're my one true love
Feels so high when we go all night
Only satisfied with you by my side
