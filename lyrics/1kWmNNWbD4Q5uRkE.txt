Right in the night
Right in the night
Right in the night you'll find
That if you want to fall in love you'll fall in love

Right in the night
Right in the night sweet thing is what you'll get
When you fall in love, you fall in love

Fall in love with music, fall in love with dance
Fall in love with anything that makes you want romance
Make a little softer on the way that you go
Just think that everything you touch could turn to gold

Fall in love with everything that you would love to love
You know that laughter is a kind form to wake you up
So don't make me feel unpleasant like you do
You know that everything will fall right back on you

So fall in love with everything, fall in love with life
Forget about your troubles and be a little nice
You will not see me if you don't want to look
Just come and get me in my big big bed of love
Big big bed of love

Right in the night
Right in the night
Right in the night you'll find
That if you want to fall in love you'll fall in love

Right in the night
Right in the night sweet thing is what you'll get
When you fall in love, you fall in love

So fall in love with stories if fairy tales are true
Innocence is part of what you're losin' with your youth
Show a little confidence, show a little class
Don't kiss the past, the past ain't gonna last

Just fall in love with passion, fall in love with lust
Fall in love with all the things you're always dreaming of
Fall in love with music and you will get by

Right in the night
Right in the night
Right in the night you'll find
That if you want to fall in love you'll fall in love

Right in the night
Right in the night sweet thing is what you'll get
When you fall in love, you'll fall in love
