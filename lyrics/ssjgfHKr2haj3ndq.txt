She's my wishing well (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
She's the earth below (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
She's oh so dangerous
Feminine smile
A windspun wild
Wild

She did what she wanted, she said what she thought
Got me in trouble for questioning God (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Silenced emotion, thought I'd be fine (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Leavin' off my woman and leadin' with my mind

I came from my mother then forgot my mother
So I'll go back to mother and I'll learn to love her
I came from my mother then forgot my mother
So I'll go back to mother and I'll learn to love her
And I'll learn to love her
And I'll learn to love her

She's a midnight sun (She's a midnight sun)
She's a pistol blue (She's a pistol blue)
She's a valley cracked open wide and the windspun wild
Wild

(She did what she wanted)
(She said what she thought)
(Got me in trouble for questioning God)
She did what she want
Said what she thought

I came from my mother then forgot my mother
So I'll go back to mother and I'll learn to love her
I came from my mother then forgot my mother
So I'll go back to mother and I'll learn to love her
I came from my mother then forgot my mother
So I'll go back to mother and I'll learn to love her
I came from my mother then forgot my mother
So I'll go back to mother and I'll learn to love her
And I'll learn to love her
And I'll learn to love her

And I'll learn to love her
And I'll learn to love her
