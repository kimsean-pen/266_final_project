Draw the silver line
Wish me well or wish me not
It became apart of us
It wasn't what I thought it was
March in single file
Never enough to fill that cup
But when you finally drink it up
It wont be what you thought it was

I'll be going away for a little while
Getting on a plane
Thinking about not landing
Change my name, my job, my face
Its awfully low the place you hide me in

You're crazy if you think I'm that weak
There's no changing my mind
I'm not that guy
I kept it in my head like a fever
It wasn't what I thought it was
It wasn't at all the way we had planned it to be
I'm passed this stage
I kept a heavy heart on my sleeve
You're make-believe

Draw the silver line
Wish me well or wish me not
It became apart of us
It wasn't what I thought it was
March in single file
Never enough to fill that cup
But when you finally drink it up
It wont be what you thought it was

Smile for the rich and for the paid
But nothing to say
(I can feel it)
I can feel a change in the way you call my name
(I can feel it)
No I am not a rich man
No fancy cars
No golden rings
(I can feel it)
But I can feel a strange sense of blame being placed on me
Not hard to see...

Draw the silver line
Wish me well or wish me not
It became apart of us
It wasn't what I thought it was
March in single file
Never enough to fill that cup
But when you finally drink it up
It wont be what you thought it was
