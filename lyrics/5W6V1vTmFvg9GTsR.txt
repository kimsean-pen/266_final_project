There's a serpent coiling around my neck
The adoring crescent moon in blazing night
The holy river Ganga flowing through my muddled hair
In the ancient times before I learned ov who I am

If I am a missing link between the pig and the divine
I shall cast the pearls before the swine

I am no good shepherd on an ox
But a solitude ov the loneliest star
Like a 1000 shrines subsumed into the void
Like a dead space in between the suns

Is a God to live in a dog? No!
But the highest are of us
Is a God to live in a dog? No!
But the highest are of us

Elohim (Elohim!)
I shall not forgive!
Adonai (Adonai!)
I shall not forgive!
Living God (Living God!)
I shall not the forgive!
Jesus Christ (Jesus Christ!)
I forgive thee not!
