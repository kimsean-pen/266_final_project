By happy hearts or broken
We stuck by you and you know
Your bold swagger made us forget
The dagger at our throat
You're always in a hurry and rage
Now call it defiance or a coming of age
But you've cast your last spell on us
You've bombed your last bridge to us all

We used to love America
We used to love America
We used to love America
We used to love America

You would've won the world by letting go
But when you lost your way
Your glory days are gone
So smile and roll over
We have so much more in common today
All hail the stumbling child king
Coiling for the vanishing lights
Now stay with us as brothers
Through this darkest of nights

We used to love America
We used to love America
We used to love America
We used to love America

And I remember how you sang
And we all should sing again
Screw the rest
The West knows best

Yeah, I remember how you sang
And we all should just sing again
Screw the rest
The West knows best
Oh screw the rest
The West knows best
Screw the rest
The West knows best
Screw the rest
The West knows best

We used to love America
