I've been thinking a lot about you lately
And I don't know what's come over me
But you know, I can't stop 'cause I won't make it
It's in my personality

'Cause I'm hooked
I'm hooked on your dopamine
What you do to me is no good
But baby, you're good for me, so good for me

We break apart to build something new
Chasing after what I have with you

Is it just me? 'Cause I feel wasted
I'm feeling what you're giving me
I know you say "Give it a try"
But now I'm riding on the line
Don't care what it does to me, yeah

I'm hooked
I'm hooked on your dopamine
What you do to me is no good
But baby, you're good for me, so good for me

We break apart to build something new
Chasing after what I have with you
We break apart to build something new
I'm chasing after what I have with you

'Cause I'm hooked
I'm hooked on your dopamine
What you do to me is no good
But baby, you're good for me, so good for me

We break apart to build something new, yeah
Chasing after what I have with you
