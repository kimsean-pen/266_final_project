It is almost like we've died entwined in that way we are.
And our voices,
our touch,
our lips are searching for answers
to questions not asked.
It is not a belief in dreams.
It is not a refusal to accept.
It is a refusal to let go.
And words written over time only serve to paint these days
a clearer shade of black.
Now a dying wave on a shallow sea.
Now a dying wave on a shallow sea.
See, our lives fade apart to converge
-- only in my darker hours,
only in my saddest hours...
Take these words pulled from me tied to you.
Destroyed,
Destroyed,
Destroyed,
Destroyed.
Yours Always.
