Sometimes I still breathing
What I don't believe
As if superstition can keep you away from me

Well, it still same as it never forever was
Haunted by who can I be now
Same as forever I never was
Looking for some easy way out

So if you come back, come forever
And don't you ever go away
And tell me that we can be together
Cause baby I am here to stay

I always knew you would come back
I always knew you would come back, come back to me
I always knew you would come back
I always knew you would come back, come back to me

So come back, come back, a comeback, the comeback
I wanna dance and never dance again [?]

A comeback, a comeback, a comeback, the comeback, come back
Ever lose my thing again [?]

Somehow I wish I could forget the first that I
feel (down) [?] Steamed up into something ... [?]
Now we are, eye to eye and our chemical
Any other way to keep this hot?
Cause you and me here we belong
Excuse me while I kiss the sky

So if you come back, come forever
And don't you ever go away
And tell me that we can be together
Cause baby I am here to stay

I always knew you would come back
I always knew you would come back, come back to me
I always knew you would come back
I always knew you would come back, come back to me

So come back, come back, a comeback, the comeback
I wanna dance and never dance again [?]

A comeback, a comeback, a comeback, the comeback, come back
Ever lose my thing again [?]

Wrap them down [?]
Hold me up [?]
Tell the man [?]
I'm your gun
Pull my trigger
Wrap them down [?]
Hold me up [?]
Tell the man [?]
I'm your gun
Pull my trigger
