Outside in your ---
I take my chances there
I am glad to see what's there
I am glad to see what's there
How bout we take a trip and start in on our love affair
How about I take you to Japan
I'd be glad to see you there
I'd be glad to see you there

But don't you expect me to share my love with you
Oh oh no

Gotta keep your heads up
Gotta keep your feet down
We don't want love
At least not from that crowd

How about we make a quick memory out of this ---
I'd be glad to be in there
I'd be glad to be in there
It's not an evil trick you know that I don't ---
I'm not the kind to bring you there
We can never see what's there
We can never see what's there

But don't you expect me to share my love with you
Oh oh no

Gotta keep your heads up
Gotta keep your feet down
We don't want love
At least not from that crowd

Gotta keep your heads up
Gotta keep your feet down
We don't want love
At least not from that crowd
