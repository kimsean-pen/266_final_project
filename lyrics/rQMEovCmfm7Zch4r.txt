Hard to know
Maybe if I skim the stone
Walk a different way back home
It would all make sense.
Oh, shut my eyes
Lose myself in teenage lies
If I fell in love a thousand times
Would it all make sense?

Cause I
I've been feeling pretty small
Sometimes

Feel like I'm slipping down walls
And every line
I ever get a hold
It seems to break.
Ca-Call you up
I can tell you just how much
No, no maybe I'll just get drunk

And it will all make sense.
Or if I weren't so nice
Convince my friends that you won't write

I can promise you my heart don't cry
Would it all make sense?
Cause I
I've been feeling pretty small
Sometimes
Feel like I'm slipping down walls
And every line
I ever get a hold
It seems to break.
Oh I
I've been feeling pretty small
Sometimes
Feel like I'm slipping down walls
And every line
I ever get a hold
It seems to break.
