Naku penda piya-naku taka piya mpenziwe

Liberian girl
You came and you changed my world
A love so brand new
Liberian girl
You came and you changed me girl
A feeling so true

Liberian girl
You know that you came
And you changed my world
Just like in the movies
With two lovers in a scene
And she says: "Do you love me?"
And he says: "So endlessly"
I love you Liberian girl

Naku penda piya-naku taka piya mpenziwe

Liberian girl
More precious than any pearl
Your love so complete
Liberian girl
You kiss me then Ooh, the world
You do this to me

Liberian girl
You know that you came
And you changed my world
Just like in the movies
With two lovers in a scene
And she says: "Do you love me?"
And he says: "So endlessly"
I love you Liberian girl

Naku penda piya-naku taka piya mpenziwe

Liberian girl
You know that you came
And you changed my world
I wait for the day
When you have to say "I do"
And I'll smile and say it too
And forever will be true
I love you Liberian girl
