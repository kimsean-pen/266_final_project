Don't close the shades I'm scared of the darkness
I'm cold as a razor blade inches from madness
Don't let me sleep here they're all trying to kill me
I've seen the walls moving they've all heard me screaming, screaming

Feed me, feed my needs and then just leave me
Let me go back where you found me
'Cause I miss my basement, the sweet smell of new paint
The warmth and the comforts of home so feed me give me my treatment
And free me my arms are so hungry so feed me

The room's so distorted and filled with mad shadows
I feel like a carcass white like a marrow bone
It all seems so long ago I remember them laughing
I heard the ambulance scream I saw the red light flashing, flashing

Feed me, feed my needs and then just leave me
Let me go back where you found me
'Cause I miss my basement the sweet smell of new paint
The warmth and the comforts of home so feed me give me my treatment
And free me my arms are so hungry so feed me

Feed me, feed me, feed me
Feed me, feed me, feed me
Feed me, feed me, feed me
