As I walk past the mirror, something caught my eye
Oh, I could be the liquor, but I can't deny
Damn, I feel good
Damn, I feel nice
Hooh, I'm on fire!
I just had to look twice
'Cause tonight I'm feeling like
I wanna kiss myself, I wanna kiss myself
I wanna kiss myself, I wanna kiss myself
I wanna kiss myself
I wanna kiss myself
I wanna kiss myself
If they don't love you, gotta love yourself
Don't let them be above you, ain't like no one else
Damn, I look good (Look good, look good, so good)
Damn, I feel nice (Oh no, no no no!)
Hooh, I'm on fire! (Fire, fire, fire!)
I just had to look twice
'Cause tonight I'm feeling like
I wanna kiss myself, I wanna kiss myself
I wanna kiss myself, I wanna kiss myself
I wanna kiss myself
Take my selfie, who could that be?
Looking so fly in this Giveranchy
Boys all on this, boys wanna kiss
Please don't try it, you'll get dismissed
It's about time that I'm feeling better
Talking with my ex, he's so whatever
Out with my girls, we stick together
Baby, you know we won't stop forever
I wanna kiss myself
I wanna kiss myself
I wanna kiss myself
I wanna kiss myself
