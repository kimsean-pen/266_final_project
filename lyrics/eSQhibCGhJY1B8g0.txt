I'm down on this Earth
I feel like time's ticking, for no one else
And I know my devils are dying to see me
So I'm looking for help

That's right I'm looking for help
But my sun's setting and I'm never myself
And I know my angels are dying to save me
They're dying to save me

The sooner you know
How to get with the times, yeah
The sooner you grow
And better your time here
The sooner you know
How to get with the times, yeah
The sooner you grow
And better your time here
Better get with the times

And now I'm left with the doubt
But my mind's aching from thinking about it
And I know my limits are dying to test me
Are dying to test me

The sooner you know
How to get with the times, yeah
The sooner you grow
And better your time here
The sooner you know
How to get with the times, yeah
The sooner you grow
And better your time here
Better get with the times

And if you're gonna say "gonna be here"
And get caught up in this I guarantee you
And if you're gonna say "gonna be here"
And get caught up in this I guarantee you
Gotta get with the times yeah
Get with the times

I try to count on my self but my love's fading
I'll figure it out and I'll wait my turn
But I'm dying to see you
I'm dying to see you
