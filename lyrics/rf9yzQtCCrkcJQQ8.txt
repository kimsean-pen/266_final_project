I don't play, no way
It's so grey, I'm okay
If you play you won't stay
If you stray there's no way
It's your day today
We're here and we stay
It's your day today
We're here and we stay

I don't play, no way
It's so grey, I'm okay
If you play you won't stay
If you stray there's no way
It's your day today
We're here and we stay
It's your day today
We're here and we stay
