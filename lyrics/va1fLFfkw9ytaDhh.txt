Here i am
As old as you
Here i am
As Goos as new
Never alone
Lighthouse of pain
Here i am
Far Away

Only Child
Where Child is found
Our Home, Our Home
Where's the light that save our lives?
Roots alone
Guide us home

Here i am
Without a home
Here i am
A Carved out soul
Always alone
When i fall
Here i am
After All
