And now I wait my whole lifetime
For you
And now I wait my whole lifetime
For you

I ride the dirt I ride the tide
For you
I search the outside search inside
For you

To take back what you left me
I know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so I may find

And now I wait my whole lifetime
Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

So long I wait my whole lifetime
For you
So long I wait my whole lifetime
For you

The more I search the more my need
For you
The more I bless the more I bleed
For you

You make me smash the clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime

Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn
HEAR ME
And if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
SEE ME
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
HOLD ME
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
SAVE ME
And when you see me strut
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn
HEAR ME
And if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
SEE ME
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
HOLD ME
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
SAVE ME
And when you see me strut
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn
