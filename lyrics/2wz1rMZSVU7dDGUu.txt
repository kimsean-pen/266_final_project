I called a psychic on the phAm
one today
It's something I rarely do

But for reasons that I can't explain
I feel I am splitting in two

I don't know who I have been
There's a stranger in my skin

I used to be somebody
I used to be somebody
Now I am someone else

I took a look at my reflection
I didn't recognize myself
The person in the mirror was a shell
Hollow on the inside; as empty as a bell
And I can hear it ringing out for miles around

My friends say I need help

But I know I'm not crazy

I am only someone else
Wahoho
I am someone else

I used to be somebody
I used to be somebody
Now I am someone else

And time takes a toll
I feel the seasons change
I hear the thunder roll

I used to be somebody
I used to be somebody
Now I am someone else

I used to
be somebody
I used to be somebody
Now I am someone else
