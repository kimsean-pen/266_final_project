I didn't wanna catch feels
But all your sex just appeals
I gotta have it again and again and again

Every time i feel I'm gonna dip
I green text box you from my flip
And I cave again and again and again

Baby this rock isn't faux
With every little text it grows
Like I can't make love all on my own
Get your shit together let's go, let go
And I know I ain't no Romeo
But I would kms so hard just to
Prove that you'll get vertigo
When I fuck you like that, promise that you'll like it oh

You got it baby you got it
You got it baby you got it
You got it, baby all over me

You got it baby you got it
You got it baby you got it
You got it, baby all over me

I've never been this whipped
Feel the cane coming down real swift
I gotta have it again and again and again
Flex it till I break my wrist
Repeat it like I'm an addict
I think about it again and again and again

Baby this rock isn't faux
With every little text it grows
Like I can't make love all on my own
Get your shit together let's go, let go
And I know I ain't no Romeo
But I would kms so hard just to
Prove that you'll get vertigo
When I fuck you like that, promise that you'll like it oh

You got it baby you got it
You got it baby you got it
You got it, baby all over me

You got it baby you got it
You got it baby you got it
You got it, baby all over me

Say it, oh baby go on just
Let the words spill from your mouth
Tasted, you in my mind
Now I gotta have
The real thing baby

You got it baby you got it
You got it baby you got it
You got it, baby all over me

You got it baby you got it
You got it baby you got it
You got it, baby all over me
