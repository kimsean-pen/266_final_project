(I just don't get it anymore.
They don't even gang-bang with a purpose.
Cold-hearted killers that barely that barely got facial hair.
I'm tired of tryin' to get through.
These days you try to be a hero,
and your wife'll end up wearin' black listenin' to a 21 gun salute.
I just don't understand these young men.
Maybe I should quit fightin' what I don't understand.
Hmmm... I can't keep up with this too much longer)

Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Shoot first, ask questions last.
That's how these so called gangsta's last.
