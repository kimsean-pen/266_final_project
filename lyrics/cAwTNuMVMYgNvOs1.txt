There are no cities, no cities to love,
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!

Atomic to rest,
A line in search of power
I found my test sight
I made a ritual of emptiness

There are no cities, no cities to love,
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!

We walk to a walk-off
The edge of mad, oh life
Do town a bright flash
My body is a souvenir

There are no cities, no cities to love,
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!
There are no cities, no cities to love,
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!
It's not the weather, it's the nothing we love!

It takes a lot for me see it,
Hopes it better sets you free
I went it through the thought of you
I went it through the void of me
I've grown afraid of everything that I love

There are no cities, no cities to love,
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!
There are no cities, no cities to love,
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the weather, it's the nothing we love!
It's not the weather, it's the people we love!
