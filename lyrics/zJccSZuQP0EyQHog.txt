I believe, I believe in a thing called sin
I believe, I believe, I believe we don't always have to win
And I know we could lose it all and finally be rich
I believe I can be my own favorite bitch
Whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa

Walking in with the antidote
Herd of sheep, but you call them goats
Honesty is lonely, but I'm stronger than death
I'll be the worst, be the worst, you can be the best
Found myself just to be myself
Save your love if it means I'm free
I don't need nobody, but I'll play this game once
Oh, maybe I can believe in a thing called us, oh
You kissed me real and now I'm fucked

I believe, I believe in a thing called trust
I believe there's a fine line between love and lust
And I know we could lose it all and finally be rich
I believe I can be my own favorite bitch
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Don't take my breath, it's getting harder to breathe
You say: love is blind
but now it's all that I see
Forever takes the longest time
But that's okay with me
Because I believe, I believe, I believe on us
Found ourselves just to be ourselves
You gave me love, now it's all
They say nothing lasts forever, but, baby, I, I
I believe, I believe, I believe on us
Oh, can't believe I believe, I believe in love

Don't wake me, feels like I'm dreaming
I've been waiting for someone to believe in
And you made me take off my bad disguise
That's why I do believe and I cut down all my trees
'Cause you mean that much to me and your family is strict

Whoa, I'm your favorite bitch
Whoa, I never thought I'd commit
And we could lose it all, but with you, I'd still be rich
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, I'm your favorite bitch
Whoa, I'm your favorite bitch
