He left me alone completely
For once I slept deeply
And for this, I thank The Father
But I gotta tell you something
That you don't wanna hear
It's the truth and that's never easy to hear
But my new man
Well, he ain't that bad
And let me explain to you why

I do what I want and I do what I like
Left my hometown to lie about what no one saw
But I soon found out I can't expand on my own theme
I needed a partner to creep in and feel his stead
Life made no sense without a beating, you see?
And life was just too quiet with no one screaming at me
And then the incidental boogie grabbed a hold of me
And I got myself a real man who don't hit that hard
So I can still work at my job

But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
Cos I'm no closer to free
Cos I'm no closer to free
But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me

I still do what I want and I still do what I like
But now, I got this man to show me that I'm all wrong
He hits me left, he hits me right all the time
But no marks, no marks, no evidence to see
Don't you know these days I feel so lucky?
To be brutalized means you don't have to think
And life is easy when there is only pain to compete
Life is easy

But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
Cos I'm no closer to free
Cos I'm no closer to free
But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
Cos I'm no closer to free
Cos I'm no closer to free
But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
Cos I'm no closer to free
Cos I'm no closer to free
But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
