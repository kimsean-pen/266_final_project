And in time
this one reminds the other of a past
A life lived much too fast to hold onto
How am I losing you?
A broken house, another dry month waiting for the rain
And I have been resisting this decay
I thought you'd do the same

But this is all I ever was
and this is all you came across
those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed
because that's not the truth
and now I'm losing you

Fragile sound, the world outside
just watches as we crawl
Crawl towards a life of fragile lines
and wasted time

So I cry
as I hold you for the last time in this life
This life I tried so hard to give to you
What would you have me do?

But this is all I ever was
and this is all you came across
those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed
because that's not the truth
and now I'm losing you

Where I use to end was where you start
You were the only one
Now I see your eyes move too fast
You were the only one

Careful hands
And wandering without there much to say
Your words were empty as the bed we made
Is there another way?
Oh love, is there another way?

But this is all I ever was
and this is all you came across
those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
and now I'm losing you
Now I'm losing you
