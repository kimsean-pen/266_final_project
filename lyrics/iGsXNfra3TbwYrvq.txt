I don't sit alone 'cause I got you
Making trunks through these woods
I gonna get my blues, just holding snacks
Dropping these tabs a hero comes

This is the last trip
Just wanna get you on your own
(He's in flight)
I say this is the last trip
Just wanna get you on your own
It's a gas

Now I don't see no light
I don't taste no spit
Silent flash hear the bang
I'm gonna get my rush
(This feeling)

No going back
(This feeling)
Holding hands
(This feeling)
With you
(This feeling)
The circus comes
(This feeling)

This feeling, this feeling
This feeling, this feeling, this feeling

This is the last trip
Just wanna get you on your own
(He's in flight)
This is the last trip
Just wanna get you on your own
(He's in flight)

This feeling
This feeling
This feeling
This feeling

This feeling
This feeling
This feeling
This feeling
