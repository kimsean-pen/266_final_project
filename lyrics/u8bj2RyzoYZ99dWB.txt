Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight!

Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh! What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh! What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song
Just get a bobtailed bay
Two forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead

Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh! What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh! What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle, jingle bells, can't you hear those jingle bells
Jingle, jingle bells, can't you hear those jingle bells

Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh! What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh! What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
