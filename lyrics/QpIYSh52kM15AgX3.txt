Oregon girl I've been around the world
But I've never seen another Oregon girl.
Oregon girl with your lips and curls;
I want a taste of that Oregon girl.

There's a mountain.
There's a time to.
They were put up there to keep us apart.
So I watch you making plans and I make plans.
You could kick a drum but
You just try to stop me now
From movin' on with an Oregon girl.
HEY!

Wait for me another year or two
I will graduate and marry you.
You roll the number and I'll buy the lumber
To build a house up on an Oregon hill.

There's a mountain.
There's a time to.
They were put up there to keep us apart.
So I watch you making plans and I make plans.
You could grow a thumb
But you just try to stop me now
From movin' on with an Oregon girl
