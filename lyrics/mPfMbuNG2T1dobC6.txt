Don't even try to tempt me with the keys of the Taj Mahal
Or the Leaning Tower of Pisa 'cause I heard it's about to fall
There ain't no pyramids or palaces for me
Already got a home, it's the only place I need

It might be big, it might be small
There ain't no paintings on the wall
And the bed might not be long enough

The neighbours want us all to leave
Then they're callin' the police
Kick us out if they were strong enough

It's my house
'Cause my house is your house, my heart is too
It's my house
'Cause my house is your house, there's room for you

It's my house
Ain't no walls you can keep my heart in
Ain't no walls I won't lock you out
It's my house

You don't need a flying pigeon 'cause you already know the way
You can bring your best friend with you and I'd love to have you stay
We can play some music, yeah, we can watch the sun go down
This house is yours and mine, you can always come around

It might be big, it might be small
There ain't no paintings on the wall
And the bed might not be long enough

The neighbors want us all to leave
Then they're callin' the police
Kick us out if they were strong enough

It's my house
'Cause my house is your house, my heart is too
It's my house
'Cause my house is your house, there's room for you

It's my house
Ain't no walls you can keep my heart in
Ain't no walls I won't lock you out
It's my house

Ain't no walls you can keep my heart in
Ain't no walls I won't lock you out
It's my house

(I told you before, I'ma tell you again)
It's my house
(It's your house, it's our house)
It's my house

It's my house
'Cause my house is your house, my heart is too
It's my house
'Cause my house is your house, there's room for you

It's my house
