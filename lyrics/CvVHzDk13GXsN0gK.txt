A little more today, a little less the next
Halves and quarters are keeping me going
A little less today, a little more the next
Halves and quarters are keeping me going

I'm wearing myself off the one thing that's keeping me alive
I'm wearing myself off the one thing that's helping me to survive
I'm splittin' the pills that aide me with my ills
I'm wearing myself off the one thing one day at a time

A little more today, a little less the next
Halves and quarters are keeping me going
A little less today, a little more the next
