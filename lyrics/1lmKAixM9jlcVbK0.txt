Here's the weight of the world on my shoulders
Here's the weight of the world on my shoulders
On my shoulders!
All alone I pierce the chain
And on and on all the sting remains
And dying eyes consume me now
The voice inside screams out loud
I am focused on what I am after
The key to the next open chapter
Cause I found a way to steal the sun from the sky
Long live that day that I decided to fly from the inside
Every day a new deception
Pick your scene and take direction
And on and on I search to connect
But I don't wear a mask and I have no regrets
I am focused on what I am after
The key to the next open chapter
Cause I found a way to steal the sun from the sky
Long live that day that I decided to fly from the inside
I can't escape the pain
I can't control the rage
Sometimes I think that I'm gonna go insane
I'm not against what's right
I'm not for what's wrong
I'm just making my way and I'm gone
Here's the weight of the world on my shoulders
Cause I found a way to steal the sun from the sky
Long live that day that I decided to fly from the inside
That I decided to fly from the inside
That I decided to fly from the inside
