There are times when I don't know where I stand (Woah, sometimes)
You make me feel like I'm a boy and not a man (Woah, sometimes)
There are times when you don't give me a smile (Woah, sometimes)
I'll lie awake at night and worry for a while (Woah, woah)

It's ok, 'cause I know
You shine even on a rainy day and
I can find your halo
Guides me to wherever you fall

If you need a hand to hold
I'll come running, because
You and I won't part till we die
You should know

We see eye to eye, heart to heart

There are times when I cry, 'cause you she'd no tears (Woah, sometimes)
You mind's so far away, but your body's right here (Woah, sometimes)
There are times when I just walked out your door (Woah, sometimes)
And thought I'd never get to see you anymore (Woah, woah)

It's ok, 'cause I know
You shine even on a rainy day and
I can find your halo
Guides me to wherever you fall

If you need a hand to hold
I'll come running, because
You and I won't part till we die
You should know

We see eye to eye, heart to heart

Oh, oh, woah, sometimes
Oh, oh, wherever you fall

If you need a hand to hold
I'll come running, because
You and I won't part till we die
You should know

We see eye to eye, heart to heart

I can find your halo
Guides me to wherever you fall
