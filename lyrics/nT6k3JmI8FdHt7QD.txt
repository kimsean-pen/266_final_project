Tonight I believe
That you are the reason I dream
Wrapped up in sheets
I'm wrapped up in everything

But here comes the light
Stealing me back from you
Leaving the night
Leaving me so confused

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

'Cause I wanna close my eyes and sleep
Run to the place we used to meet
'Cause I'd rather have you in my dreams
Then wake up without you

Cause I'd sleep forever if you'd leave
Give up the world so you would see
That I'd rather have you in my dreams
Then wake up without you

Come to my dreams
Daylight won't find us here
We're finally free
Free to go anywhere

So give me the strength
Strength just to say goodbye
Goodbye to the world
The world we could leave behind

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

'Cause I wanna close my eyes and sleep
Run to the place we used to meet
'Cause I'd rather have you in my dreams
Then wake up without you

Cause I'd sleep forever if you'd leave
Give up the world so you would see
That I'd rather have you in my dreams
Then wake up without you

Don't give up, I'll never let you
Don't give up, I'll never let you
Don't give up, I'll never let you go

I wanna close my eyes and sleep
Run to the place we used to meet
'Cause I'd rather have you in my dreams
Then wake up without you
Cause I'd sleep forever if you'd leave
Give up the world so you would see
That I'd rather have you in my dreams
Then wake up without you
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
Without you
