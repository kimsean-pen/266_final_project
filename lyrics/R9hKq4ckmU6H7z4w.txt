It's been a long time to be missing you, you, you
You're on your way now, lover, and I'm over the moon
Everything's all, in place
But there is one thing clear
Christmas isn't Christmas 'til you get here
Those sleigh bells ring, ring, ring
Whole room is bling, bling, bling
So many fairy lights are busy sparkling
They glimmer and they glow
It's all for you, my dear
Christmas isn't Christmas 'til you get here

There's a present by the fireplace
Wrapped especially for you
But all that I want is to see your face
That's how you make my wish come true

The second hand ticks by
You bring me butterflies
You're getting close now baby
I can feel it inside
And when you're holding me
That's when you make my year
Christmas isn't Christmas 'til you get here

Tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh
Tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh
Tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh
Tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh
Tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh, tuh
Christmas isn't Christmas 'til you get here

There's a present by the fireplace
Wrapped especially for you
But all that I want is to see your face
That's how you make my wish come true
I hear the doorbell chime, baby, you're right on time
That little taste is it
I'm looking into your eyes
I better run, run, run because it's all so real
Christmas isn't Christmas 'til you get here
Christmas isn't Christmas 'til you get here
Christmas isn't Christmas 'til you get here
