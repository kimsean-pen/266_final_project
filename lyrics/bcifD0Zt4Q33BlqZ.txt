Everyone left this old town
Only I'm getting old with this town
I just wanna leave here
But I wanna stay here
All the friends I used to know left this town
Only I'm getting old with this town
I just wanna stay here
But I wanna leave here
Don't know why
Time chose that instead of me

Everyone left this old fucking town
Only I'm getting old with this town
I just wanna stay here
But I wanna leave here
All the friends I used to know left this town
Only I'm getting old with this town
I just wanna leave here
But I wanna stay here
I'm always late
Time chose that instead of me

How are you today
The street where we used to hang out is fine
How are you today
The beach where we used to hang out is fine
There're just another stupid day
Being together was all that matter to me
There're so many people like it used to be
But I feel nothing inside
Nothing inside
