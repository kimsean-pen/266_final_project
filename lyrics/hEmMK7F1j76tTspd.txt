There's one way out and no way in
Back to the beginning
There's one way back to home again
To where I feel forgiven
What is this I feel? Why is it so real?
What am I to say?
It's only love, it's only pain
It's only fear that runs through my veins
It's all the things you can't explain
That make us human
I am just an image of
Something so much greater
I am just a picture frame
I am not the painter
Where do I begin? Can I shed this skin?
What is this I feel within?
It's only love, it's only pain
It's only fear that runs through my veins
It's all the things you can't explain
That make us human, that make us human
That make us human
It's only love, it's only pain
It's only fear that runs through my veins
It's all the things you can't explain
That make us human, that make us human
That make us human, oh, that make us human
