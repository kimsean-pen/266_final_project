Standing on the dark canal
By the gasworks
Celebrate the ghost gone by
When all love hurts

And the medicine man here 24/7
You can get it fast in Armageddon
Everyone on the way to heaven
Slowly

Call for prayer is common around here
In the morning
Wash our faces go to work
There is no warning

That it all gets better when life is straight
It's bigger than you and the Welfare State
And we'll keep singing it's not too late
For you
