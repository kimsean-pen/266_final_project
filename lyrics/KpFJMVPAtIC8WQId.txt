You want all my love and my devotion
You want my love and soul right on the line
I've had no doubt, that I could love you, forever
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time

You've got one night only, one night only
That's all I have to spare
One night only,
Lets not pretend to care
One night only, one night only
Come on, big baby, come on
One night only
We only have till dawn

In the morning this feeling will be gone
It has no chance going on
Something so right has got no chance to live
So lets forget about chances, it's one night I will give

One night only, one night only
You'll be the only one
One night only
Then you'll have to run

One night only, one night only
There's nothing more to say
One night only, words get in the way
One night only, one night only, one night only
