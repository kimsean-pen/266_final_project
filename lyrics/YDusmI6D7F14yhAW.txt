I woke up to a change of winds
Bleak gusts from the north set in
Weeks to shore and storms pending
My cardinal points are all lost on me
In the rivers of the dark
I have rifled In the depths of disgrace
I have hurt
I refuse to view this as failure
A part of me that I cannot desert

I've cried this ocean
And the tears that I wept shadows the apparent horizon
I've cried this ocean

I woke up to a change of will
Cold hearts silent still I lied in wait for the change of the course
Across the ocean in search of the source
Shadows of fate by my side as I
rumble Landfall in sight makes me crumble

I've cried this ocean
And the tears that I wept shadows the apparent horizon
I've cried this ocean
I've cried this ocean
