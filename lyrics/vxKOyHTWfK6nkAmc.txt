In the dead of night hear my angel call
Darkness come alive sing to sleep my soul
Take away my pain take away my woe
Darkness come alive sing to sleep my soul
Darkness come alive
In the dead of night see the shadows crawl
Darkness come alive sing to sleep my soul
In the shadows eyes watching over me
Darkness come alive please sing my soul to sleep
Footsteps on the floor voices in the wall
Shapeless forms waiting in the dark
Afraid to open eyes fear what's staring back
Death sits waiting for me in this endless black
Death's sweet lullaby
To the darkness pray
My nightmares never end
Sing to sleep my soul
