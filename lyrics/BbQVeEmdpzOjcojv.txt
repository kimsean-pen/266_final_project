Why the fuck I do that?
Tell me why the fuck do I do that
Two racks on some Gucci shoes
Why the fuck do I do that?
Tell 'em why the fuck I do that
Who's that? wish you were in a room
Why the fuck do you do that?
Tell me why the fuck do you do that
Girl, you know that Imma die real soon
Why the fuck do you do that?
Tell me why the fuck do you do that

Give me a break from all this bullshit
Give me a break from all this bullshit
Give me a break from all this bullshit
She just want me for the coke drip
Give me a break from all this bullshit
Give me a break from all this bullshit
Give me a break from all this bullshit
She just want me for the coke drip
Give me a break from all this bullshit
Give me a break from all this bullshit
Give me a break from all this bullshit

Give me a break from all this bullshit
Give me a break from all this bullshit
