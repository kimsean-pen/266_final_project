Roll on out the grand parade
Send up all the fire and wings
The butcher here to gut the day
And spill out the sudden king

All the bravest boys
Waiting for the world to end

I never knew you all that well
Your rifle came before your name
Our mothers share a slice of hell
Smoking under heavy rain

All the bravest boys
Waiting for the world to end

And all the bravest boys
Are waiting for the world to end
For the world to end
(Over It before it began)

And all their favorite toys
Are buried there beside their friends
If the world will end
(Over it before it began)

Huddled on our shadowed hill
The town is a fallen steed
Chocolate milk and wounded birds
The rumours in the trembling leaves

And all the bravest boys
Are waiting for the world to end
For the world to end
(Over it before it began)

And all their favorite toys
Are buried there beside their friends
If the world will end
(Over It before it began)

All the bravest boys
Waiting for the world to end
