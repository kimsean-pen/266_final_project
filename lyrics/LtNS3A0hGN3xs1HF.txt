Bobby built a spaceship in his backyard
Susan never works for free
Sammy got a sense for fashion
He's a lot like you and me
Lizzie never liked Louisiana
Tony never took the train
Ruby's running from the police
Jenny's in the hall of fame
Debbie was a saint
Chelsea ran away
Ain't we all the same?

Cause I'm a freak like you
Cause I'm a freak like you
Never change us
Young and dangerous
Mother it's true
Cause I'm a freak like you
Yeah, I'm a freak like you
We're all just fucking pretty nasty, it's cool

Sam is still swinging in the sold house
Hayley's never given head
And Johnny keeps jumping on the tightrope
He really should be dead
Ooh!
Amy's too addicted to the TV
William is wearing drag
Katie's got a wig she likes to mess up
And Christopher is clinically mad

And he's a freak like you
Yeah I'm a freak, me too
Never change us
Young and dangerous
Mother it's true
Cause I'm a freak like you
Yeah, I'm a freak like you
We're all just fucking pretty nasty, it's cool

Life is but a game
We all sing from the same pages
Of books you can't judge by the cover
Cause I'm a freak like you

Cause I'm a freak like you
Cause I'm a freak like you
We're all just fucking pretty nasty, it's cool
Cause I'm a freak like you
Yeah I'm a freak like you
Never change us
Young and dangerous
By my mother it's true
Come on baby and sing

Na na na
Nana na
Na na na no
By my own mother it's true
Na na na no
Na na na no
We're all just fucking pretty nasty, it's cool
We're all just fucking pretty nasty, it's cool
