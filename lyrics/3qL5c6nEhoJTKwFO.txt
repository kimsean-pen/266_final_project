I was told this is where I will start loving myself
Flirting's delicious; proved to be beneficial for mental health
All of my best bits pulled forward, collected, displayed
Sadly I just think that I was disgusting, today

You blew me up like a big balloon far too soon
I'm left a stuttering teen
How did I get here? It's all so quick, and I feel sick
Red pushing down on the green

Could you love this? Will this one be right?
Well if I'm being honest, I'm hoping it might
Could you love this? Did you plan to fall?
Well if I'm being honest, oh I bet it's not that at all

Hope has a cost: keeping all fingers crossed and held tight
But I look idiotic, with my limbs all knotted. It don't feel right
Truly you've shaken me, and I think you like how I plead
And I have a hunch that that's all you wanted from me

You blew me up like a big balloon far too soon
Holding my breath makes me choke
How did I get here? It's all so quick, and I feel sick
I'm used to being a joke

Could you love this? Will this one be right?
Well if I'm being honest, I'm hoping it might
Could you love this? Did you plan to fall?
Well if I'm being honest, oh I bet it's not that at all

All
All
All
All

Could you love this? Will this one be right?
Well if I'm being honest, I'm hoping that it might
Could you love this? Did you plan to fall?
Well if I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
Well if I'm being honest
Oh, I bet it's not that at all
