I can't stand the rain against my window Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain 'gainst my window
'Cause he's not here with me
Hey window pane, do you remember
How sweet it used to be when we were together?
Everything was so grand, yes it was
Now that we've parted
And there's one sound that I just can't stand
I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain alone with the pillow
Where his head used to lay, yeah
I know you've got some sweet memories
But like a window, you ain't got nothin' to say
I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories, hey
I can't stand the rain, ooh
Against my window, oh no no
'Cause he's not here with me, uh
Alone with the pillow, uh, uh
Where his head used to lay, yeah
I know you've got some sweet memories
But like a window, you ain't got nothin' to say
Hey, hey, uh, uh
I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain
I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain
I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain
I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain
I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain
Get off my window now, get off my window
Get off my window, nah, I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain, ooh, can't stand the rain, oh
