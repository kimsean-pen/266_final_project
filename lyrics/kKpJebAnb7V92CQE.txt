Don't give a damn about nothing
Don't give a damn about you
Don't give a damn about nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

Okay, it's
It's been a hell of a day
But don't sweat it
You want notorious, you want notorious?
Sing

La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

They don't want no crying girls in the videos

Don't give a fuck about nothing
Don't give a fuck about you
Sing

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Oh, you got a song about songs
You're so meta
It could be glorious, it could be glorious
I make 'em all sing

La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

They don't want no crying girls in the videos

Okay, okay
We had a hell of a day
You don't get it
They don't want no potty mouth on the radio

Don't give a fuck about nothing
Don't give a fuck about you
Never give a fuck about nothing
If it gonna fly with you
Don't give a fuck about nothing
Don't give a fuck about you
Sing

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

How'd you like if I came to you
Told ya how to work your A&R and sell this tune
"Pull the other, yeah go pull the other
Yeah try pulling the other, the other one"
How'd you like if I came to you
You'd tell me "pull the other, the other one"
How'd you like if I came to you
Cause I did now I'm fucking up your afternoon

So you want more happy girls in the video

Okay, okay
We had a hell of a day
You don't get it
As long as you get what you want in our video

Don't give a fuck about nothing
Don't give a fuck about you
Never give a fuck about nothing
If it gonna fly with you
Don't give a fuck about nothing
About nothing, about nothing
Don't give a fuck about nothing
About nothing

I got something to say

Too many people in the club
Not enough people showing me love
So many people I can't think, ah
You better give me something to drink

Too many people in the club
Not enough people showing me love, ah
So many people I can't think
You better give me something to drink
