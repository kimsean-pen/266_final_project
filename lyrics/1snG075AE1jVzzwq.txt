Yeah, i found nowhere
It got to know me
Let me sleep all day
Spend the money
I haven't felt my legs
Since the summer
And i don't call my friends
Forgot their numbers
Vip 223
I had my chances
Or did they have me
Now stay up nights
Watch tv
I'm country sad
I'm a ballad man
I'm on a comeback roll
Yeah, i'm a blizzard
And in my motor home
Sweat on my pillow all night

Vip 223
I've had my chances
And they had me
Now stay up nights
Watch tv
I'm country sad
I'm a ballad man
Vip 223
I've had my chances
And they had me
Now stay up nights
Watch tv
I'm country sad
I'm a ballad man
I feel no?
Cos i'm a ballad man
I talk to the girls
Cos i'm a ballad man
Yeah, i?
Cos i'm a ballad man
Yeah, i sure?
Cos i'm a ballad man
