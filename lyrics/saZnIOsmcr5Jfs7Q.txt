Just when they thought you were through
You've burned their lies, now your strengthened, it's true
Turn your backs on your enemies
And let those motherfuckers rot in their jealousy

They can't stand
That the world's up for taking and we're adamant, hell bent
Determined to dominate everything (we are the fire)
We are the fire
Resound the anthem (we are the fire)

The music connects, unites us more
Our masses strengthened, an unstoppable horde
We're all now a family
Together let's show the world what we say

They can't stand
That the world's up for taking and we're adamant, hell bent
Determined to dominate everything
Turn your backs on your enemies
And let those motherfuckers rot in their jealousy
We're all now a family
Together let's show the world what we say (we are the fire)
We are the fire
Resound the anthem (we are the fire)
We are the fire
Resound the anthem (we are the fire)

Fire

We are the fire
We are the fire
Resound the anthem (we are the fire)
We are the fire
Resound the anthem (we are the fire)
We are the fire
Resound the anthem (we are the fire)
We are the fire
Resound the anthem
We are the fire
