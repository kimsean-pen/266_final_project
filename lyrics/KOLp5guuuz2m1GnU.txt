I've got a hole in my heart
Where your love used to be
I've got no air in my lungs
Where I used to breathe
I've got a hole in my heart
Where your love used to be
And I don't want to close my eyes and fall asleep

'Cause everytime I do I'm only dreaming of you, oh, oh, oh
I don't want to live my life half awake
Wishing for the words to say

If I ask you to stay just for a little while, just for a little while longer
Would you push me away or would you stay a while, just stay a while with me?
And fix the hole in my heart
Where your love used to be
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You were the thorn on the rose that I used to hold
You're the light on the match when I'm getting cold
But there's no easy way to live when you've taken all I have to give
I'll pick you up each time you fall
When we've had too much alcohol, oh, oh, oh

If I ask you to stay just for a little while, just for a little while longer
Would you push me away or would you stay a while, just stay a while with me?
And fix the hole in my heart
Where your love used to be

The words are falling out of my mouth again
Don't listen to a thing
It's funny how three words they don't mean a thing
When you're not here with me

If I ask you to stay
If I ask you to stay
Won't you please fix the hole in my heart
Where your love used to be
