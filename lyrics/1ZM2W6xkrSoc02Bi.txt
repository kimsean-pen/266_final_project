(Deniece Pearson)

Watching all the films as they go back in time
Waking all the pictures, but I never knew why you went
Rivers run dry
Reading all the letters made up in my mind
Never thought that moment would have ever been mine
But then I threw it all away

You were nearly mine until yesterday
'til I found out you were playing around
While I was waiting for you, so

Chorus:
Stay out of my life
I don't wanna know the truth
Stay out of the darkness
While I'm reaching for you
Stay out of my life
I don't wanna know the truth
Cause the memories surround my mind
Oh you can never forget a broken heart

Two long hard years, I fought back the tears
It took a lot of pressure
To admit that I was right where I started from
Rivers run dry
All you lonely people without a love
There a scientific senses coming down from above
To find nothing there to hold

You were nearly mine until yesterday
'til I found out you were playing around
While I was waiting for you, so

Repeat chorus

Never forget the day you took my love
You were leading me on
Ooh it's taking me over
I never thought I'd have the price to pay
I had it all wrong now it's all over

Stay out of my life
I don't wanna know the truth
Stay out of the darkness
While I'm reaching for you
Stay out of my life
I don't wanna know the truth
Cause the memories surround my mind

Stay out of my life
I don't wanna know the truth
Stay out of the darkness
While I'm reaching for you
Stay out of my life
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know, no no no

Stay out of my life
I don't wanna know the truth
Stay out of the darkness
While I'm reaching for you
Stay out of my life
No no oh
Stay out of my life, yeah
Stay out of the darkness
