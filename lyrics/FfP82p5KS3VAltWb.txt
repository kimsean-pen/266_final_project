The common man don't suffer pain like this
Only the soul that has never been kissed
Let us adore our beatiful son
He's riding on the rivers of Babylon

Booting up and shooting up and bring on the brightness
See the son of God is coming up and I see a likeness
Internalize the lunacy, the misery is showing
When you're brought up, you're caught up in a system that is going

No one answers, no one takes that call from you (times 3)
Junkie man, tell me what you're story is (times 2)

Water I desire
Some parents' house is on fire
Slowly the house gonna burn to the ground
The neighborhood will watch, they're gonna sound
Will someone be a witness, please tell me that he's crazy
But he's not and they know that and can't get him 'cause he's not crazy
Beat him, lock him, knock him, take away his authority
Hit 'em, ship 'em, club 'em, submitted conformity

No one answers, no one takes that call from you
Junkie man, tell me what your story is

My hand went blind
You're in the vane, clairvoyant
You're in the vane, clairvoyant
My hand went blind
I make love to my trance sister
My trance sister
And my trance parents see from the balcony
I looked out on the big field
On the big field, it opens like the cover of an old bible
And out come the wolves
Out come the wolves, their paws trampling the snow and the alphabet
I stand on my head watching it all go away

Booting up and shooting up and bring on the brightness
See the son of God is coming up and I see a likeness
Internalize the lunacy, the misery is showing
When you're brought up, you're caught up in a system that is going

No one answers, no one takes that call from you
Junkie man, tell me what you're story is
