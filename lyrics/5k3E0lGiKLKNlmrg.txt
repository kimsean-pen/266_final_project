I believe
That when the hurting
And the pain has gone
We will be strong
Oh yes, we will be strong

And I believe
That if I'm crying
While I write these words
Is it absurd?
Or am I being real?

I believe
That if you knew just
What these tears were for?
They would just pour
Like every drop of rain

That's why I believe
It is too late
For anyone to believe

I believe
That if you thought for a moment
Took your time
You will not resign, resign
Resign yourself to your fate

And I believe
That if it's written in the stars
That's fine
I can't deny
That I'm a Virgo too

I believe
That if you're bristling
While you hear this song
I could be wrong
Or have I hit a nerve?

That's why I believe
It is too late
For anyone to believe

I believe
That maybe somewhere
In the darkness, in the night time
In the storm in the casino
Casino Spanish Eyes

And I believe
No I can't believe that every time
You hear a new born scream
You just can't see the shaping of a life
The shaping of a life
