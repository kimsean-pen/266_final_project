Once, once upon a time
Thought that you'd be mine
But then you let your colors shine
I wanted to believe
That you were right for me
Well how could I be so naive
Now we're broken
Forget me not
I'm falling down and I can't stop

Let's go down to the apple tree
Naive as Adam and Eve
Let's go down to the apple tree
Fighting against gravity
Falling too deep
So can you catch me?

Twice, twice I caught you out
My head was in the clouds
But I woke up and came around
To see, you play stupid games
Temptation in your way
'Cause I went so fast from love to hate
Now I'm broken
Is this your plan?
I'm falling down and I don't understand

Let's go down to the apple tree
Naive as Adam and Eve
Let's go down to the apple tree
Fighting against gravity
Falling too deep
So can you catch me?

You keep playing, you keep playing
I keep praying, I keep praying
That we could have been us
You keep playing, you keep playing
I keep saying, I keep saying
That it should have been us

Let's go down to the apple tree
Naive as Adam and Eve
Let's go down to the apple tree
Fighting against gravity
Falling too deep
So can you catch me?

Falling too deep, so can you catch me?
