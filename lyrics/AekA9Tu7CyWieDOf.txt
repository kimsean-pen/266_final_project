Screaming your name into the sky
Into the sky
Screaming your name into the sky

Were you just going to sit back and watch him die?
Were you just going to sit back and watch him die?

He screamed your name straight to the sky
He screamed you name everyday

Rescue him from the fall
Rescue him, take his hand
Take his hand (2x)

I remember the day and every sound and smell of it
I remember the day and every sound and smell of it
I remember the day
Just like it were in a photograph
Just like it were in a photograph

Where nothing ever changes and always stays the same
Where nothing ever changes
The memory stands still

You let him fall
You let him fall

Screaming your name into the sky
So I tried
And I screamed
And I screamed
Lord, can you hear me?

And I was left with no reply, so I walked away
You let him fall
You let him fall
You let him fall
You let him...

Without your response
I blame you for this loss of life
