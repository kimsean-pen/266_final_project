I got something on my back
that I need to get off, baby.
The world's been nuts
Just the other day I had to reprimand a grown-up
Who am I to act this way?
Well suga, I'm the boss lady
Busy handlin' and managin'
But oh, when I get next to you, baby
Ain't nobody gonna be there but me and
you, you, you, you

(Can't wait to be loved by you)
I-I can't wait, baby
(Can't wait to be loved by you)
I've been working so hard and so long
(Can't wait to be loved by you)
I need to come home, I do
I do
(Can't wait to be loved by you)

I've been going through some things
feelin' all kind of hectic in my space
We all runnin' the same race
as we pace, I'm...
staring monsters in their face
(you'd be surprised)
Money made, bills to be paid
like each and everybody
But baby, I'm me
and I need you
Oohh
When I get next you to you baby,
ain't nobody gonna be there
but me and you, you, you

(Can't wait to be loved by you)
I-I can't wait, baby
(Can't wait to be loved by you)
I've been working so hard and so long
(Can't wait to be loved by you)
I need your arms
I do, I do
(Can't wait to be loved by you)

Come to me soon
What, you wanna get off?
You can get it off right here
Baby, no fear at all
that old thing gone
don't worry 'bout it no more
Got you baby
No, I got you right here
Deep in the bedroom
(I got you baby)
Or maybe in the back of the car
What up?
(What up, baby?)
Repeat

When I get next you to you baby,
ain't nobody gonna be there
but me and you!

(Can't wait to be loved by you)
And I can't wait, baby
(Can't wait to be loved by you)
I'm busy holding the world on my shoulders
(Can't wait to be loved by you)
And baby I know you're
out there doing
what you need to do too.
