Memories start to fade, only a gray thought of something
Was it even me?
All the scars remind me I was somewhere
Forgotten you were so don't dare to rise
Stay in your tomb, whoever you were

I washed myself with pain a long time ago
So deep that nothing can reach me

These deep shadows of my heart, crushing pain
It follows in voices, the rooms, the garden
Leaving me to bleed the truth of it all

Who ever is sentenced to love will bow down as a servant of sorrow

Searching memories of the days of light
It will kill me, even a touch of warmth
But I long for it more
Than the stone I've turned to

Alone in this castle, in these halls of gloom
An old shape, once a brave man
Now the servant of sorrow
