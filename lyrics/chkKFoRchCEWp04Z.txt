You are, pushing my patience
Lied to and used
I'm sick and tired of being
Denied and refused
Hurting me (hurting me)
Breaking me (breaking me)
Hurting me (hurting me)
Burning me

'Cause what you see is real and true
(You can't take that away from me)
No matter what you do
(You can't take that away from me)
Won't let it slip away
It means too much to me
'Cause what you see is real and true

I will not let you break down
What I've built up
I will do whatever it takes
To make this stop
Hurting me (hurting me)
Breaking me (breaking me)
Hurting me (hurting me)
Burning me

I won't let it go!

'Cause what you see is real and true
(You can't take that away from me)
No matter what you do
(You can't take that away from me)
Won't let it slip away
It means too much to me
'Cause what you see is real and true

You see things from a different point of view
Why should I listen?
Why should I let you in?
Why should I even trust you?
We are like two different worlds apart
Won't let you in on what is rightfully mine
Why should I even trust you (trust you...)

Hurting me (hurting me)
Breaking me (breaking me)
Hurting me (hurting me)
Burning me (burning me)

I won't let it go
'Cause what you see is real and true (You can't take that away from me)
No matter what you do (You can't take that away from me)
Won't let it slip away
It means too much to me
'Cause what you see is real and true
Real and true!
