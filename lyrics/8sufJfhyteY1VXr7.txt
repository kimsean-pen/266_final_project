That original feeling never went away
That's why I'm standing here today
Whoa oh, Whoa oh
So many up and downs
And nothing has changed
That's why you know I'm here to stay
Whoa oh, Whoa oh

So put your arms around me
And then stay there forever
Let it always be this way
You and me together
So put you arms around me
And I'll never let go
I know that's easy words to say
But I mean it more then ever
Your's is the kind of love
makes nothing else feels good enough
And I'm never gonna give you up

Oh no, Oh no
That original feeling never went away
That's why I'm standing here today
Ain't nobody gonna take your place
Only you made me feel this way
So many up and downs
And nothing has changed
That's why you know I'm here to stay
Whoa oh, Whoa oh
Ain't nobody gonna replace
Only you make me feel this safe

So put your arms around me
And then stay there forever
Let it always be this way
You and me together
So put you arms around me
And I'll never let go
I know that's easy words to say
But I mean it more then ever

Yours is the kind of love
Makes nothing else feel good enough
And I'm never gonna give you up
Oh no, Oh no
Yours is the kind of love
makes nothing else feel good enough
And I'm never gonna give you up
Oh no, Oh no
I can't explain what's the glue that holds us in

Whoa oh, Whoa oh
I can't refrain if I had a chance I'd do it over again
Whoa oh, Whoa oh

So put your arms around around me
And then stay there forever
Let it always be this way
You and me together
So put you arms around me
And I'll never let go
I know that's easy words to say
But I mean it more then ever

So put your arms around around me
And then stay there forever
Let it always be this way
You and me together

So put you arms around me
And I'll never let go
I know that's easy words to say
But I mean it more then ever

Yours is the kind of love
makes nothing else feel good enough
And I'm never gonna give you up
Oh no, Oh no
Yours is the kind of love
makes nothing else feel good enough
And I'm never gonna give you up
Oh no, Oh no
Yours is the kind of love
makes nothing else feel good enough
And I'm never gonna give you up
Oh no, Oh no
