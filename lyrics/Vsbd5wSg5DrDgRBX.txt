Hours and days rolling by like seconds
I'm still grinding my teeth down on the truth
I fell for you in so many ways I need to breathe in
But when I'm with you I can't help its the truth

You've got you're friends and you built your whole life here
I'm from a small place, somewhere unfamilliar
You're not alone, you've got somebody waiting
But wait a second
I've got so much more to give

No one's gonna be there for you like I am
I am I am
No one's gonna be there for you like I am
I am I am
It could be, it could be a waste of time
But it's gonna be, gonna be worth the fight
No one's gonna be there for you like I am
I am I am
I am I am
I am I am

I work and I sleep and I'm busy and I'm restless
Until it's all emotion on a fast train ride home with you
Is it hard for you like it is for me, I'm going crazy
And some days I can't deal with the truth

It's still a git and it never feels easy
But look me in the eye and tell me you're happy
I know she benefits, she's known you longer
But wait up, wait up
I've got so much more to give

No one's gonna be there for you like I am
I am I am
No one's gonna be there for you like I am
I am I am
It could be, it could be a waste of time
But it's gonna be, gonna be worth the fight
No one's gonna be there for you like I am
I am I am
I am I am
I am I am

One last cup, swinging
Blue light, slow evening
Free fall, hushed screaming
Wait up, wait up
I've got so much more to give

No one's gonna be there for you like I am
I am I am
No one's gonna be there for you like I am
I am I am
It could be, it could be a waste of time
But it's gonna be, gonna be worth the fight
No one's gonna be there for you like I am
I am I am
I am I am
I am I am

No one's gonna be there for you like I am
I am I am
No one's gonna be there for you like I am
I am I am
It could be, it could be
It's gonna be, gonna be

No one's gonna be there for you like I am
I am I am
