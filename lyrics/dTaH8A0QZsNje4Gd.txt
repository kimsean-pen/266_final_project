Darkness had us covered when we split from Minnesota in the morning
In the rain
Black as I was feeling and the street was slick and shiny as a snake
Each of us was a-humming to a half forgotten echo
Hangin' over in the brain
Tappin' time and thinking of the time we never had the time to take

Losing to the rising cost of living high and loving hard
And leavin' every yesterday behind
Learning every bridge you cross, is burning down before you're off and
running
Like the devil just in time

Chorus:
Breakin' any ties before they bind you
Taking any comfort you can find
Running like you're running out of time
Take it all-take it easy-till it's over-understanding
When you're headin' for the border lord
You're bound to cross the line

Good lookin' women every time you stumble
Waitin' there to catch you when you fall
Gettin' to you bad enough to let em
Keep you backin' up till just before your back's against the wall

Chorus:
Breakin' any ties before they bind you
Takin' any comfort you can find
Runnin' like you're runnin' out of time
Take it all-take it easy-till it's over-understanding
When you're headin' for the border lord
You're bound to cross the line
