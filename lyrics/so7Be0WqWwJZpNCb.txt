I saw an angel flying today Just like a movie
I couldn't speak I couldn't walk away
Cause you flew right through me
And I'm not waiting, these hands are chaken, trembli'n,, I've been taken by you

And I was, lost before tonight and
I'm so amazed in how you've touched me
And maaa,, and make it right
Cause I,,, cause I light up when I see you, Light up, I light up, I light up when I see you
Light up, I light up, I light up, Yeah

I saw another side today I didn't know existed
No words could ever help explain,, and I almost missed It

I'm not waiting, these hands are chaken, trembli'n,, I've been taken by you
And I was, lost before tonight and
I'm so amazed in how you've touched me

And maaa,, and make it right
Cause I,,, cause I light up when I see you, Light up, I light up, I light up when I see you
Light up, I light up, I light up, Yeah
Like sterile lights in the dark

We rise like sparks
Like sterile lights in the dark
We rise like sparks
Like sterile lights in the dark
We rise like sparks
Like sterile lights in the dark
We rise like sparks, Yeah
Cause I light up, I light up, I light up,
You make me, Yeah
Light up, I light up, I light up, Yeah
