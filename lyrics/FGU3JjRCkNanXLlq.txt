You're sweet just like the sun
But what happens when the sun doesn't stay?
The night reminds me when you went away
(I don't care, I don't care)
Now my mind was pacing, heart is racing contemplating things that I lack
Even though you left me by myself, do I want you back?

Will you stay or will you walk? will you let go?
Leave me all alone
I'm giving you one more chance
To make things last
Ring around the roses then she'll stay

Leave me once Leave me twice
Kiss good-bye that will suffice
When you go away
Don't look back
Leave me once and i'll be fine
Leave me twice i'll make you mine
Just one more chance to make it once again

As the days go by, I am asking why did you leave
You left me alone and then you walked out on me
(I don't care, I don't care)
Thinking of days, thinking of ways,
thinking of things to you that I should say
I wanna be with you and that's the only way

Will you stay or will you walk? will you let go?
Leave me all alone I'm giving you one more chance
To make things last Ring around the roses then she'll stay

Leave me once
Leave me twice
Kiss good-bye that will suffice
When you go away
Don't look back
Leave me once and i'll be fine
Leave me twice i'll make you mine
Just one more chance to make it once again

Don't say good-bye, just dry your eyes
A tear for everything that I did wrong
Don't say goodbye, just dry your eyes
Listen now just try and see me please don't leave me now.

Leave me once
Leave me twice
Kiss good-bye that will suffice
When you go away
Don't look back
Leave me once and i'll be fine
Leave me twice i'll make you mine
Just one more chance to make it once again
