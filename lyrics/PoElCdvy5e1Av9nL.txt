Boy I've been cooking up one hell of a crush
I've got you on my mind the minute I wake up
You make the morning glow, make the rooster crow, get my juices flowing
You know I got the spice but it ain't enough

Baby would you be my sugar, sugar?
Make my heart race, even on a good day
You make the world taste better, better
Good on anything, want you on everything
Just a little bit is all it takes
Like a Coca-Cola on a Christmas Day
You're what I crave babe, what can I say?
Would you, would you
Would you be my sugar, sugar?

Tried the fake shit but it ain't the same
A girl just knows when it's the real thing
Yeah I'm a cup of tea with a touch of cream but something's missing
So I'm gonna put this nice and sweet

Baby would you be my sugar, sugar?
Make my heart race, even on a good day
You make the world taste better, better
Good on anything, want you on everything
Just a little bit is all it takes
Like a Coca-Cola on a Christmas Day
You're what I crave babe, what can I say?
Would you, would you
Would you be my sugar, sugar?
Would you be my sugar, sugar?

Sugar sugar, you make my heart race
Even on a good day you make the world taste
Better better, good on anything
Just a little bit is all that it takes

Sugar, sugar
Make my heart race, even on a good day
You make the world taste better, better
Good on anything, want you on everything
Just a little bit is all it takes
Like a Coca-Cola on a Christmas Day
You're what I crave babe, what can I say?
Would you, would you
Would you be my sugar, sugar?
Would you be my sugar, sugar?
Yeah
