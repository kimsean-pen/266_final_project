Took a little time to get where I wanted
It took a little time to get free
It took a little time to be honest
It took a little time to be me
I took a little lover but then we parted
I took a little time to get over this
From time to time, I get heavyhearted
Thinking of how you used to kiss
Courage
It's a feeling like no other
Let me tell you, yeah
Courage
In harmony with something other than your ego
Courage
The sweet belief of knowing nothing comes for free

Do you really wanna know,
About these lines on my face?
Well, each and every one is testament to
All the mistakes I've had to mak
To find courage
It's a feeling like no other
Let me tell you, yeah
Courage
In harmony with something other than your ego
Courage
The sweet belief of knowing nothing comes for free
For free...
Courage
It's a feeling like no other
Let me tell you, yeah
Courage
And harmony with something other than your ego
Courage
The sweet belief of knowing nothing comes for free
