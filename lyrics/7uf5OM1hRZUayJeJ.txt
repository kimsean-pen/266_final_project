So you're born and
So you thought
The future's ours
To keep and hold
Oh, child within
Has healing ways
It sees her through
My darkest days

I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine
I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine

In my elusive dreams
In my elusive dreams

Some may know
Through life no fun
I wanna feel
I wanna run

I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine
I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine

In my elusive dreams
In my elusive dreams

Gonna keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine
Keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine
Gonna keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine

Oh, in my darkest dream
Oh, in my darkest dream
Oh, in my darkest dream
Oh, in my darkest dream

My elusive dreams
My forgotten schemes
My elusive dreams
My forgotten schemes

I see through you
You see through me
I see through you
You see through me
I see through you
You see through me
I see through you
You see through me

Believe in me
Believe in you
Believe in me
Believe in you

I see through you
You see through me
I see through you
You see through me
I see through you
You see through me
I see through you
You see through me

To feel the light
To feel the light
To feel alive
To feel alive

Oh, that elusive dream
