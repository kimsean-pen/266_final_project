So what am I supposed to do?
hmm yeah
When I am doing things that ain't good for you
So what am I supposed to say?

Shen I try so hard but it feels the same

Said this growing love wont grow
If you don't let me be myself
Said this growing love wont show
Ooh 'cause right now ain't good for my health
my health
'cause you are selfish
Caught in the mood tonight
and you always thinking 'bout you
and you selfish conceited by your own right
yeah maybe is my point of view
And you are selfish
Caught in the mood tonight
And you always thinking 'bout you
And you selfish conceited by your own right

Yeah maybe is my point of view

See her days quicky gone
hmm
All her problems left it alone
alone
Still I feel like nothing's change
hmm
She wants to move into the fast lane
in the fast lane

'cause you're selfish
Caught in the mood tonight
and you always thinking 'bout you
and you selfish conceited by your own right
maybe is my point of view
And you're selfish
Caught in the mood tonight
and you always thinking 'bout you
and you selfish conceited by your own right
Yeah maybe is my point of view

'cause you are selfish
Caught in the mood tonight
and you always thinking 'bout you
and you selfish conceited by your own right
Yeah maybe is my point of view
And you are selfish
caught in the mood tonight
and you always thinking 'bout you
and you selfish conceited by your own right
Yeah maybe is my point of view
And you are selfish
caught in the mood tonight
and you always thinking 'bout you
and you selfish conceited by your own right
Yeah maybe is my point of view
And you are selfish
caught in the mood tonight
and you always thinking 'bout you
and you selfish conceited by your own right
and maybe is my point of view
