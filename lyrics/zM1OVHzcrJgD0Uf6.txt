If fears what makes us decide
Our future journey
I'm not along for the ride
Cuz I'm still learning
To try and touch the sun
My fingers burning
Before you're old you are young
Yeah I'm still learning
I am falling down
Try and stop me
It feels so good to hit the ground
You can watch me
Fallin on my face
It's an uphill human race
And I am falling down
I'm standing out in the street
The earth is moving
I feel it under my feet
And I'm still proving
That I can stand my ground
And my feet are there
Haven't washed my hair
To be lost before you are found
Don't mean you are losing
I am falling down
Try and stop me
It feels so good to hit the ground
You can watch me
Fallin on my face
It's an uphill human race
And I am falling down
I'm standing out in the street
The earth is moving
I feel it under my feet
And I'm still proving
That I can stand my ground
And my feet are there
Haven't washed my hair
To be lost before you are found
Don't mean you are losing
Some day I'll live in a house
Etc., etc., etc.
Don't you know that's not for now
And for now I'm falling
Down... down... down...
Down... down... down
Down... down... down
I am falling down
Yeah e Yeah.Yeah e Yeah
I am falling down
Try and stop me
It feels so good to hit the ground
You can watch me
Fallin on my face
It's an uphill human race
And I am falling down
I'm standing out in the street
The earth is moving
I feel it under my feet
And I'm still proving,
That I can stand my ground
And my feet are there
Haven't washed my hair
To be lost before you are found
Don't mean you are losing
I'm falling down
pI'm falling down.I'm falling down... I'm falling...
