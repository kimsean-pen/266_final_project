Just keep it down, keep it down
I've been stalking you for a long time
That party was lit
I saw your tweet
You're under my skin
Just a killer queen
We're OTP
I'm down with that

Don't wanna keep it in low-key
You're on fleekit's hundo P
Do you wanna Netflix'n'chill with me?
Just slide into my DM

Every time i say never mind
Don't you try to drop it away?
Make it calm
Just keep it down
(just keep it down, keep it down)

Every time i say never mind
Don't you try to drop it away?
Make it calm
Just keep it down

Through a darkened moment
Through the rise and fall in the sun that shine
In every breath your strength is shown
As you fight for love!

You've come over me
My eyes turned red
What can I say?
You're not the moon
I used to praise
You're cougar bae

Another day I'm opening my eyes
And fucking waiting for the night
If I could swipe my life to the right
I'd like to check next one

Another day I'm opening my eyes
And fucking waiting for the night
If I could swipe my life to the right
I'd like to check next one

Every time i say never mind
Don't you try to drop it away?
Make it calm
Just keep it down
(just keep it down, keep it down)

Every time i say never mind
Don't you try to drop it away?
Make it calm
Just keep it down

I'll hold you close 'till the light split the sea
We've made a new profile
I'll hold you close till the light split the sea
Ill still be here inside of your heart
