Baby, remember on the bus and my hand was on your knee
When you love somebody it's hard to think about anything but to breathe
Baby, I am the cub who was washed out in the flood
When you love somebody and bite your tongue all you get is a mouthful of blood

Okay

Baby, remember on the bus and my hand was on your knee
When you love somebody it's hard to think about anything but to breathe
Baby, I am the cub who was washed out in the flood
When you love somebody and bite your tongue all you get is a mouthful of blood

Here we go

Baby, I am the cub who was washed out in the flood
When you love somebody and bite your tongue all you get is a mouthful of blood

When you love somebody it's hard to think about anything but to breathe
When you love somebody it's hard to think about anything but to breathe
When you love somebody and bite your tongue all you get is a mouthful of blood
When you love somebody it's hard to figure out, hard to figure out
When you love somebody it's hard to figure out, hard to figure out

When you love somebody it's hard to think about anything but to breathe
