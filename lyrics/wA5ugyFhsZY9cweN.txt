How many times are you gonna try to shut me out?
I told you once, told you twice: I ain't turning back around.
You can say whatever, try to mess with me, I don't care, I'm not scared.
You don't have to say you're sorry, save your sympathy.
With a friend like you I don't need an enemy
I would give you time if you were worth it
But guess what? You're not worth it.

Woah woah I'm always gonna be the last one standing
Woah woah because I'm never gonna give up trying
And now I'm ready to go, I'm here, I'm waiting for you
And I'm gonna be the last one standing

Did you think that I would surrender easily?
That just like that, you would get rid of me?
Is that the way you saw it all go down?
I don't think, I don't think so.
There's not a word you can say I haven't heard before
So give it up, give it up unless you want a little more
You think you're pretty tough so let's throw down
It's alright, I'm alright
Woah woah I'm always gonna be the last one standing

Woah woah because I'm never gonna give up trying
And now I'm ready to go, I'm here, I'm waiting for you
And I'm gonna be the last one standing
I won't give up, I keep trying

(I'm always gonna be the last one standing)
It's not over, I keep fighting
(I'm always gonna be the last one standing)
I won't give up, I keep trying
(I'm always gonna be the last one standing)
It's not over, I keep fighting
I keep fighting!

Woah woah I'm always gonna be the last one standing
Woah woah because I'm never gonna give up trying
And now I'm ready to go, I'm here, I'm waiting for you
And I'm gonna be the last one standing
And I'm gonna be the last one standing
Woah woah the last one standing
Woah woah the last one standing
