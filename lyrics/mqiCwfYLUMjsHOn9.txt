You know how we've grown
And how they captured the tone
Everyone's a writer
But I see the pictures of every life
And the day they die
But it's your image burnt into my mind
And again I find
That it's worth the climb
And my love is right on time

Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
