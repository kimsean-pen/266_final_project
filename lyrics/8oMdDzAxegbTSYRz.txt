Carrion
In a moment I'm lost
Dying from the inside
Her eyes take me away
Tear me apart from the inside out
Dead eyes speak in volumes?
But our lips refuse to move
Could this ever be the last time?
The final time that we see this through?

Give me the strength to return
Return the breath you've stolen
Give me the means to reset
Her heart I've broken again
Reflection built upon sorrow
We're walking the darkest roads
Within chests carved with regret

In a moment I've lost
Dying from the inside
Her eyes take me away
Tear me apart from the inside out
From the inside out
The inside out

We've been running blind
Now we're falling through the cracks
We're left running
We are running blind
Now we're falling
Falling through the cracks

Back to the world of the dead
Her shining eyes mark our return back
To the world of the dead
In a moment I've lost
Drowning from the inside
Her eyes take me away
Tear me apart
From the inside out

My love I left
My heart I left
With my promise to return
A promise to return
