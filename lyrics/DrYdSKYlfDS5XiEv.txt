Even in the harshest of winter I feel so warm

Even when the marks climb up the wall I still feel small

This is my home
This is my home

Where I go when I've got nowhere else to go

This is my home
This is my home

Where I go when I don't know where else to go

I know everything about this place, it wears your face
Even when my body blows away, my soul will stay

This is my home
This is my home

Where I go when I've got nowhere else to go

This is my home
This is my home

Where I go when I don't know where else to go

Do you feel safe?
Do you feel safe?
Do you feel safe?
Do you feel safe?

This is my home
This is my home
Where I go when I've got nowhere else to go
This is my home
This is my home
Where I go when I don't know where else to go
