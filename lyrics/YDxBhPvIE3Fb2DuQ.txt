On a night when I can breathe
We can wind back the years
When your life ain't a mess
Least you think it's like that

Oh Cassandra, I can't stop you from dying, dying alone
Oh Cassandra, I can't give you what you had, when you were young
I wake up, and I give you all I got, it ain't enough, ain't nothing is
Can you hold back the tears one more night.

If the weight lifts from your eyes
Yeah, I'll pray for blue skies
I'll never know how you feel
When the fog sets in for real
and I don't get out too much
and you ain't soft to the touch
still I ride through the night
Just to keep by your side

Oh Cassandra, I can't stop you from dying, dying alone
Oh Cassandra, I can't give you what you had, when you were young
I wake up, and I give you all I got, it ain't enough, ain't nothing is
Can you hold back the tears one more night
