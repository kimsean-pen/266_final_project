Tracing the circle; serpent's diamond
One and all now black
Maw overflowing with dense menses
Tracing the circle; serpent's locutions
Shiny the slattern form
Holiest of devourments
Sacred
Tracing the circle; serpent's thunderbolt
The acolytes of filth
Rinsed in vice and glorious knavery
Made as the filth of the world
In much fear and trembling
Head shorn in prophecy
Baptised in opaqueness
Slattern despot
Within such turpitude
Tracing the circle; serpent's thunderbolt
Mask of Lilitu
Readies the blade of Cain
Down diamond FLIGHTS
But a single clutch of ashes
All tongues toward the void
Olding and encircling time
A saturn beyond mortal perception
Within her briar fortress
