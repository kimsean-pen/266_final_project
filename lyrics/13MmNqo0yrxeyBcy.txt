Well alright.
With you it's never good enough, because you want the stuff
that could change your future
Your life's amongst a sea of chance and now the more
you dance it just gets you sinking deeper
It's OK, don't apologize
You don't know what your striving for
and you never seem to try.

It's too early, go live your life
Keep on moving, it's time to

Ride, Ride, Ride
Now it's time to...
Ride, Ride, Ride

Everything seems tempting

but nothing comes for free
I often wonder how you drive,
when the road's too dark to see
It's too early, it's time to...
Ride, Ride, Ride
Relight the fire to watch it burn,
but when it comes
your turn, all that's left is embers...

You ran this race with no real heart,
you're right

back at the start, you'd already lost it...
It's OK, don't apologize
You don't know what you're striving for

and you never seem to try.

It's too early, go live your life
Keep on moving, it's time to
Ride, Ride, Ride

Now it's time to...
Ride, Ride, Ride
Everything seems tempting

but nothing comes for free

I often wonder how you drive,
when the road's too dark to see
It's too early, it's time to
Ride, Ride, Ride

Everything feels tempting,
when you don't know who to be
I often wonder how you feel,
when you're laying next to me
It's too early, it's time to

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
It's all road
Yeah, Yeah
And after all I've done
Yeah, Yeah
no answers.
(ride, ride, ride)
you know it's not enough
you know it's not enough
you know it's not enough.
