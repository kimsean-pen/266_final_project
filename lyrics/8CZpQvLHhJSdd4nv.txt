Millionaire say
Got a big shot deal
And thrown it all away
But I'm not too sure
How I'm supposed to feel
Or what I'm supposed to say
But I'm not, not sure

Not too sure how it feels
To handle every day
And I miss you love
Make room for the pray
'Cause I'm coming in
With what I wanna say but

It's gonna hurt
And I love the pain
A breeding ground for hate but...
I'm not, not sure
Not too sure how it feels

To handle everyday
Like the one that just passed
In the crowds of all the people
Remember today

I've no respect for you
And I miss you love
And I miss you love

I love the way you love
But I hate the way
I'm supposed to love you back
It's just a fad
Part of the, teen, teenage against brigade and
I'm not, not sure
Not too sure how it feels

To handle everyday
Like the one that just passed
In the crowds of all the people
Remember today

I've no respect for you
And I miss you love
And I miss you love
Remember today
I've no respect for you
And I miss you love
And I miss you love
I love the way you love
But I hate the way
I'm supposed to love you back
