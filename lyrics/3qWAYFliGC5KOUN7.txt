When I look into your eyes
I've got a feeling
You're just a lonely ride
With both ends burning tonight

Well here I am, another thousandth sister to the night
And mouthing tricks into my ears, the cigarette you light
Is burning out to the deep
Like me

When I see you again
I've got a feeling
Our wires crossed end-to-end
And you're reeling the girl in again

Well here I am, another thousandth sister to the night
And mouthing tricks into my ears, the cigarette you light
Is curling up from beneath
Like me

Girl, won't you dance for me?
Girl, won't you dance for me?
