So many nights I sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark but now
Youv've come along

and You light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my day
and fill my nights with song

Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally i'm turning for home
and finally, a chance to say hey,
I love you
Never again to be all alone

Cause you,()

Cause you, You light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
and fill my nights, fill my nights with song
with song

Woooh! You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
and fill my nights with song

It can't be wrong
Whenit feels so right, wooooh
Cause you
You light up my life, my love
Oh, Lord my life
