Shadows
Shadows and fever
No one hears him cry so he turns to evil
Only now, only now does he know

Pains
Always those pains
Once he turns that way he will do it again
Only now, only now does he know
Silver doom, unseen moon will show

As they dance under the moon they bring doom
He calls her friend and says he'll change
She calls him friend and he deceives again

Flowers
A scent of flowers
Always on his mind so he deceives her
Only now, only now does she know

Love
Love makes her blind
Soon she follows him through the doors of time
Only now, only now does she know
Silver doom, unseen moon will show

As they dance under the moon
They bring doom
He calls her friend and says he'll change
She calls him friend and he deceives again

He calls her friend and says he'll change
She calls him friend and he deceives again
