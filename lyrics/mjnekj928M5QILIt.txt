Inside the rose
How does it grow?
How can you know?
Where does it go?
I'll make you bloom
Beyond the zoom
Below the rose
Nobody knows
Accelerate reborn
Throw off the crown
And spiral down
Accelerate inside
Inside the rose
I see you change
Inside the rose
How does it grow?
How can you know?
Where does it go?
I'll make you bloom
Beyond the zoom
Below the rose
Nobody knows
Accelerate reborn
Throw off the crown
And spiral down
Accelerate inside
Inside the rose
I see you change
Accelerate outside
I see you change
Expiring down
Expiring down
We could fall forever
Again into the black forever
We could fall forever
Again into the black forever
