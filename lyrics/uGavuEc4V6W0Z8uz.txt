When I can't see you
You're always near
Back right pocket
I keep you there
Safely hidden
For all those times
When nothing else at all
Can get me by
Billfold out deep inside
Amongst ID and credit cards
I reach in to pull out
A thousand words of photo art
Wallet-sized, never bent
Or ever torn up in the least
I take good care of you
You mean so much to me
Pictures of you and IThey always make me smile
Even at the worst of moments
They're always what I seek
Whenever I am weak
They keep my head up
And my heart unbroken
Hair is flowing
Eyes and smile
Jump off the paper
And over miles
To bring you to me
Almost for real
No matter where I am
Or how I feel
Billfold out deep inside
Amongst ID and credit cards
I reach in to pull out
A thousand words of photo art
Wallet-sized, never bent
Or ever torn up in the least
I take good care of you
You mean so much to me
Pictures of you and IThey always make me smile
Even at the worst of moments
They're always what I seek
Whenever I am weak
They keep my head up
And my heart unbroken
It's so hard spending time away
Even short hours, much less a day
I might as well tear out my lungs
Because we fit together
Nobody knows me better
Without you I'll come undone
Undone
Pictures of you and IThey always make me smile
Even at the worst of moments
They're always what I seek
Whenever I am weak
They keep my head up
And my heart unbroken
My heart unbroken
