Just like the glorious northern star you guided me
Shining a light of pure tranquility
To a secret place where no one else could go
Free to reveal the things I never show

Strong like a symphony
You protected me from reality

Somewhere to love, somewhere to breathe
Somewhere to call my sanctuary
Here in the dark I can be strong
Knowing that nothing can hurt from now on

Somewhere to love, somewhere to breathe
Somewhere to call my sanctuary
Closer to the sun, to your heart I run

I was deserted like the moon is at the dawn
I never thought I'd ever find a place so beautiful
All my heart was falling like a stone
Deep into an ocean vast and colorful

Strong like a symphony
You protected me from reality

Somewhere to love, somewhere to breathe
Somewhere to call my sanctuary
Here in the dark I can be strong
Knowing that nothing can hurt from now on

Somewhere to love, somewhere to breathe
Somewhere to call my sanctuary
Closer to the sun, to your heart I run

One step on the horizon
A safe place up on the mountain
So far away from chaotic life

Somewhere to love, somewhere to breathe
Somewhere to call my sanctuary
Here in the dark I can be strong
Knowing that nothing can hurt from now on

Somewhere to love, somewhere to breathe
Somewhere to call my sanctuary
Closer to the sun

Somewhere to love, somewhere to breathe
Somewhere to call my sanctuary
Here in the dark I can be strong
Knowing that nothing can hurt from now on

Somewhere to love, somewhere to breathe
Somewhere to call my sanctuary
Closer to the sun, to your heart I run
