Linger for half the night
I'm in pieces
Send me all of your words
I'm leaving

I hope your night goes well
I start dreaming

Take off and say farewell
Not that I need it

I've said all that I wanted to say to you
I don't feel coming up short
Starting to choke
Sticking to you like glue

And I think my opinion is fine
And I think your opinion is blind

I've said all that I wanted to say to you
I don't feel coming up short
Starting to choke
Sticking to you like glue

And I think my opinion is fine
And I think your opinion is blind
