Tonight, somebody's lover is gonna pay for his sin
It's coming on
It's coming on
I don't know just what is leading me
Or if time is on my side
It's coming on
It's coming on

I don't know why I keep acting this way
Everybody knows it's strange
Give me something along the way
Something along the way

When I see lights on Broadway I know it's gonna be a long night
It's coming on
It's coming on

I don't know why I keep acting this way
Everybody knows it's strange
Give me something along the way
Something along the way

A hole in my head I can't fill it all
Neon lights my way
Give me something along the way
Give me something along the way

(Tonight I'm gonna leave my body)
(Tonight I'm gonna leave my body)

Tonight, somebody's lover is gonna pay for his sin
It's coming on
It's coming on

I don't know why I keep acting this way
Everybody knows it's strange
Give me something along the way
Something along the way

A hole in my head I can't fill it all
Neon lights my way
Give me something along the way
Give me something along the way

Gonna leave my body
Tonight gonna leave my body
