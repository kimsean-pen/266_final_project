If I forget where I am when I wake up, I close my eyes
Sometimes it's better to hide the emotions and stay inside
The postcards on your walls
I left them blank because they don't exist at all
You moved on, and that's common sense

It might be the way that you're always staring at me
If I stay or if I go and risk everything
She said it's all or nothing, all or nothing
A day with no ending is what this is like
You know we may be pretending but we've still got tonight
She said it's all or nothing, all or nothing

I can't remember a day I was patient and not afraid (not afraid)
To be persistent, but now I can't resist it
And I won't wake up to see that day
Because, the postcards on my walls
Say what you mean to me, but always seem to fall
You moved on, and that's common sense

It might be the way that you're always staring at me
If I stay or if I go and risk everything
She said it's all or nothing, all or nothing
A day with no ending is what this is like
You know, we may be pretending but we've still got tonight
She said it's all or nothing, all or nothing

And now does this beg the question
If we can stay, in serenity
You're too afraid, too, learned your lesson

That's what she said to me, but you're gone
You made a promise to me, and moved on
And now it's harder to breathe
Around your next complex insult and I'm left with this

If I forget where I am when I wake up, I close my eyes
Sometimes it's better to hide the emotions and stay

It might be the way that you're always staring at me
If I stay or if I go and risk everything
She said it's all or nothing, all or nothing
A day with no ending is what this is like
You know we may be pretending but we've still got tonight
She said it's all or nothing, all or nothing

She said it's all or nothing
