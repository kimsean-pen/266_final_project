And take a little walk when the worst is to come
When I saw you looking like I never thought
And say you're at a loss or forgot
That words can do more than harm

And the town is gonna talk,
But these people do not
See things through to the very minimal.
But what's it gonna cost to be gone
If we see you like I hoped we never would?

My eyes can't look at you any other way,
Any other way, any other way
When eyes can't look at you any other way,
Any other way, any other way

So take it as a song or a lesson to learn
And sometime soon be better than you were
If you say you're gonna go, then be careful
And watch how you treat every living soul

My eyes can't look at you any other way,
Any other way, any other way
When eyes can't look at you any other way,
Any other way, any other way
