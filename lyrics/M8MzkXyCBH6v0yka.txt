Since I was born they have kept me down
They have forced me to conform
I will tear down
Their holy crown in a vengeful thunder storm
I loathe their bloody righteous ways
It fills me with despise
Fuelling flames of violent rage
I will be their world's demise

Asgard's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow the throne
Deceiver, deceiver of the gods

All this rage, and all this hate
It burns me deep inside
And still it is the only thing keeping me alive
Dark ambition within my heart
And it's aching to break free
The one true nature of my soul
The giant lives in me

(Kneel) You all shall kneel to me
Or death will set you free
You all shall kneel to me
(Fall) You all shall fall to me
Vengeance will be sweet
You all shall fall to me

Asgard's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow the throne
Deceiver of the gods
Asgard's always been my home
I'm born of different blood
I've come to overthrow the throne
Deceiver, deceiver of the gods
Deceiver of the gods
