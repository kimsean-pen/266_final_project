I need to sit back
And kick out
It's about the way I'm makin you feel
Your tryin' to show me that you're happy
Really happy
But I can see that your feelings aren't for real
The unhapiness
I maybe causing you
Is definitely unintentional (Definitley unintentional)
So don't hesitate
Don't be afraid
Cuz tell me cuz my actions are not personal
But I'll tell you something right now

And tell me what's on your mind
(Can you tell me what's on your mind)
Whatever the problem may be
Uh tell me
Oh cuz the body never lies
Am I too hard (Too hard)
Too soft (Too soft)
Or am I really just selfish to the bone
So don't hesitate
I'm a psychic babe
Let your feelings all be known
But I'll tell you something right now

Wanna end up alone
