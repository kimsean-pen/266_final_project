You got me on run away
You got me full power
You got me down the avenues
That ticker tape shower
You got me walking on the moon
You got me full power
You got me on the outer reach
You got me in the tower

And that's when I feel it
The spirit is moving
Music in motion
The melody's growing
And that's when I feel it
The spirit is moving
The melody's growing
You feel emotion now
And that's when I feel it
The spirit is moving
Music in motion
Love and devotion
And that's when I feel it
The spirit is moving
Music in motion
With the melody growing yeah

If you're walking with me
I'm walking with you
If you're singing with me
Then I'm singing with you

'Cause I've been everywhere girl
Searching for my answers
Down the lonely avenues
Like all those chances
And in my darkest hour
I'll look for you
I think I heard an answer
I couldn't ignore you

And that's when I feel it
The spirit is moving
Music in motion
The melody's growing
And that's when I feel it
The spirit is moving
The melody's growing
You feel emotion now
And that's when I feel it
The spirit is moving
Music in motion
Love and devotion
And that's when I feel it
The spirit is moving
Music in motion
With the melody growing yeah

If you're walking with me
I'm walking with you
If you're singing with me
Then I'm singing with you

Yeah, yeah, alright

Cause that's when I feel it, ooh yeah
That's when we need it, alright now
That's when I feel it, when the rhythm hits
That's when I feel it, oh when the rhythm gives
That's when I feel it, oh when the melody
Hits with a meaning, I swear I mean it
That's when I feel it, it's like a gift for me
That's when I feel it, like the god of gethsemane now
That's when I feel it, oh yeah yeah
That's when I feel it, oh yeah it's like
That's when I feel it, ooh yeah
That's when I feel it
That's when I feel it
