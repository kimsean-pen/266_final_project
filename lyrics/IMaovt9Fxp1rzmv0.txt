My past has followed me and
I just can't get away
I'm not the same as I was
Leaving my disarray

(Take me just as I am)
I'm broken down
(Pull me into your arms)
I'm hanging on to every word

Save me from losing myself
I'm hanging on by a thread
Can you see who I am
Underneath my scars?
I'm afraid to fall
So I'm holding onto you
No, I won't let go
I'm hanging on by a thread

I still can hardly believe
The person I once was
I'm trying so hard to change
Help me work through my flaws

(Take me just as I am)
I'm calling out
(Pull me into your arms)
I'm holding on, to every breath

Save me from losing myself
I'm hanging on by a thread
Can you see who I am
Underneath my scars?
I'm afraid to fall
So I'm holding onto you
No, I won't let go
I'm hanging on by a thread

I'll never need
I'll never want
With you and me
I'm so complete
I'll never run
I'll never hide
With you right here
I'm safe inside

Save me from losing myself
I'm afraid to fall
So I'm holding onto you
No, I won't let go

Save me from losing myself
I'm hanging on by a thread
Can you see who I am
Underneath my scars?
I'm afraid to fall
So I'm holding onto you
No, I won't let go
I'm hanging on by a thread
