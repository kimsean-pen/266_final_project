Everytime I'm left alone
My misery begins to drown me
Tied by a rope of anxiety
Thrown overboard
As I'm pulled under the tides of this fast paced world
(Of this fast paced world) I refuse to see

Time will always be the thing that kills me truly
Open these eyes waking from a dream feigning

My lungs fill up with letdown
Disappointment in self and everyone
Expectation died in failure
Abandonment my unsavior
As I'm pulled under the tides of this fast paced world
(Of this fast paced world) I refuse to see

Time will always be the thing that kills me truly
Open these eyes waking from a dream feigning

Absolution at the sight of your demise
I know what I must do, choke
Die choking on your every word
Swallow every blasphemy
Absolution at the sight of your demise
I know what I must do
Swallow every blasphemy
Eat out your heart and make it bleed

Tie the noose around my neck
Make this life end
