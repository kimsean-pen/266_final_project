I awake by cold shivers
Apprehend voices
But not the ones in my head

I try to ignore and turn back
I shut down, gain sanity
Forcing my breathing to become slower
Forcing my pulse to beat lower

Suffocating scream behind walls
Pleading the past to let go
I find myself awake again
I am starring at the sealing
Is this all inside?

Are the suffering screams meant for me to silence?
Fumbling for the light in despair
I'm searching with my eyes for no reason
I'm stumbling in the darkness, I fall to the floor

Back on my feet again
Wrapped up in my indecision
The darkness lingers upon me

Blackness devours fast
It drives me further across the floor
Then a sudden scream shuts the door behind
A monolith of a roar summoning its daemons

Turning around for an answer
Is this all inside of me?

No way to avoid this collapse
I dare not stay, so I reach for the switch
Then a sudden scream shuts the door behind
Summoning of daemons
