Tired eyes
A voice behind my back says
The ground where you lay
Is waiting to die
We laugh
A voice inside my head says
We were the firs
and will be the last
We tried to ignore the pain
That bleeds from you, from you
You'd hide the tears that fall from your
faded eye, faded eyes
These words are all that i leave
You were the first and you'll be the last
We tried to ignore the pain
That bleeds from you
You'd hide the tears that fall from
Your faded eyes
