I can smell my defeat
I can tell it's on repeat
It's in slow-motion in my head
Your devotion soon be dead
Can't recall, I can't rejoice
It's not at all like I had a choice
Played with fire, now I burn
'cause my desire didn't let me turn
(My desire didn't let me turn)
(My desire didn't let me turn)
(My desire didn't let me turn)
(My desire didn't let me turn)

I can smell my defeat
I can tell it's on repeat
It's in slow-motion in my head
Your devotion soon be dead
Can't recall, I can't rejoice
It's not at all like I had a choice
Played with fire, now I burn
'cause my desire didn't let me turn

I'm going down
Can't pretend, it's gonna end
It's all around
Takes my soul beyond control
I'm going down

(My desire didn't let me turn)
(My desire didn't let me turn)
(My desire didn't let, didn't let, didn't let, let me turn)

I got lost, I got refused
I can't trust since I'd been used
Should have felt it from the start
But I melted with my heart
So I stayed, defied the ache
And I paid for your mistakes
I'll retire with the facts I've learned:
My desire never lets me turn

I'm going down
Can't pretend, it's gonna end
It's all around
Takes my soul beyond control
I'm going down

I'm going down
Can't pretend, it's gonna end
It's all around
Takes my soul beyond control
I'm going down

I'm going down
I'm going down
Can't pretend, it's gonna end
It's all around
Takes my soul beyond control
I'm going down
I'm going down
I'm going down

I'm going down

I'm going down
