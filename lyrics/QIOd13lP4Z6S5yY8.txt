I know how you mean, like all others do
I will be here tonight, I'm on for you

Be here to this end, all bodies so restrained

We'll be walking and rolling, in a mob of saints

Just one more night, give me whoever's soul
Going to make you sweat, going to make you scream

Blood is thicker than water, keeping control

We are bound by desire, can we govern your soul

Keep on humming, high in the move
You won't forgive me, playing on more games

Nothing's thicker than water, keeping control
We are bound by desire, can we govern your soul
can we govern your soul
can we govern your soul
