Back when I was home again
Too much time alone, thought of you often
One day I hope we would end
But will you still remember if you're miles away?
Miles away from here?

Remember summer
Remember night
Not even enough to think that there'd be no goodbye
I wanna see you grown up
Where you been all this time?

Sarah
Come back to what we could be
Sarah
One day we both will believe

Back to the place we begin
But will you still remember if you're miles away?
Miles away from here?

I'm in my home
You're on my mind
Everything was on our side, except for time
I wanna know you, grown up
Where you've been all this time?

Sarah
Come back to what we could be
(Can't you hear me?)
Sarah
(Can't your hear me?)
One day we both will believe

Over
Oh, come back
Again

Sarah
Come back to what we could be
(Can't your hear me now?)
Sarah
(Can't your hear me?)
One day we both will believe
(Can't your hear me now?)

Are you [?]
Are you [?]
(Can't your hear me, now?)
Are you [?]
Are you [?]
(Can't your hear me, now?)
