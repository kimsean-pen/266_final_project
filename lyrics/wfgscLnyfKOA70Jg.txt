Love has come to stay in all the way
It's gonna stay forever and
Everyday
It feels like a wish coming true
It feels like an angel dreaming
Of you
It feels like heaven forgiving and getting
It feels like a fading
Celebrating
Gonna call them spirits grey
I'm gonna laugh it up
You
Gotta cotton crown
I'm gonna keep it underground
Your gonna take control
Of the chemistry
Your gonna manifest the mystery
You've got a magic wheel
In your memory
I'm wasted in time
And I'm looking everywhere

I don't care where
I don't care where
Angels are dreaming of you
Angels are dreaming of you
Angels are dreaming of you

New York City is forever king
I'm wasted in time
And your never ready
Fading fading celebrating
I've got your
