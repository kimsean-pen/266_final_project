I've been watching the phases of the moon
From my window pane
I've been talking to to corners of the room
For too long, too long

Met you when my heart was somewhere else
Outside in the rain
Saw you smiling, the stories you could tell
Have you moved on, moved on?

It's so hard to get a cab at midnight on Friday
Where you going?
Downtown
So am I
Sat right here where it's dry
And if you said you're going my way
Well, maybe we should share a ride

I can feel my heartbeat
Electric to my fingertips
Oh woah oh
I can feel anticipation
Through my veins
Oh woah oh
I can almost feel the weight of your kiss on my lips
'Cause anything can happen on a night like this
On a night like this

Wouldn't mind if we caught every red light
You're someone I can get close to
You're a stranger, but there's something in your eyes
Like you know me
Could I know you?

Well, I never fell in love at midnight on Friday
Standing outside
Of town
In the rain
Well, this ride is almost over
But if I had it my way
We would just stay up all night

I can feel my heartbeat
Electric to my fingertips
Oh woah oh
I can feel anticipation
Through my veins
Oh woah oh
I can almost feel the weight of your kiss on my lips
'Cause anything can happen on a night like this
On a night like this

Our hands fit just the right way
Our legs tangled up in this small space
The world outside feels far away
As I get to know you

I can feel my heartbeat
Electric to my fingertips
Oh woah oh
I can feel anticipation
Through my veins
Oh woah oh
I can almost feel the weight of your kiss on my lips
'Cause anything can happen on a night like this
On a night like this

Oh woah oh
Oh woah oh
Anything can happen on a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this
