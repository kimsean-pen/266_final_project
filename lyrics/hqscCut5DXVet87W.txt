Ahh, touch me
(This is the night)
Ahh, touch me
I want to feel your body

Full moon in the city
And the night was young
I was hungry for love
I was hungry for fun

I was hunting you down
And I was the bait
When I saw you there
I didn't mean to hesitate

This is the night
This is the night
This is the time
We've got to get it right

(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heart beat next to mine
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me now

Quick as a flash
You disappeared into the night
Did I hurt you, boy?
Didn't I treat you right?

You made me feel so good
Made me feel myself
Now I'm alone
And you're with somebody else

This is the night, yeah
This is the night
This is the time
We've got to get it right

(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heart beat next to mine

(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me now
Touch me, touch me now
Touch me, touch me now

Hot and cold emotions
Confusing my brain
I could not decide
Between pleasure and pain

Like a tramp in the night
I was begging for you
To treat my body
Like you wanted to

I was begging for you

(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heart beat next to mine
(This is the night)
'Cos I want your body all the time

(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heart beat next to mine

(This is the night)
'Cos I want your body all the time
Ahh, touch me, touch me, touch me
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me, touch me
(This is the night)
Ahh, touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me, touch me
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me, touch me
