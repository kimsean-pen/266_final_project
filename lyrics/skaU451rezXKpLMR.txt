Millennia of chaos tearing at the walls
But only I can feel it
Only I can hear it
It's all I see now

All I see now

Silver spades and golden chains
Silver spades and golden chains

Glory be to misery
All hail eternity

But only I can hear it
Only I can feel it

Glory be to misery
All hail eternity

Say your peace
Time to die
Terminal
The soul will spiral

Make your peace
Time to die
Terminal
The soul will spiral
