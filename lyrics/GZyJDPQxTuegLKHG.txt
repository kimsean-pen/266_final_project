I thought I've gone about it wrong
The edge of raving
Heavy steps and heavy breaths
Out of faze
Out of touch
Hey, I've been causing a battle
So wonderful
Hey, I've been causing a battle
I feel so sick, so sick
In my heart
I feel so sick, so sick
In my heart
I feel sick, sick, sick
In my heart
I feel sick, sick, sick, sick
In my heart
Hey, I've been causing a battle
Someone just let me go
Hey, I've been causing a battle
My?? I've seen so far
I feel sick, sick, sick, sick
In my heart
I feel sick, sick, sick, sick
In your heart
I feel sick, sick, sick, sick
In my heart.
