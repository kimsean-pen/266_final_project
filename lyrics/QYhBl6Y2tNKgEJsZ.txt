ditch the consequences
gimme just the last hurrah
make it linger like a spring gives winter time to thaw
trouble comes easy
i dodge what i can
how'd it all get so...
out of hand
for the aches i still take
was made to do
let the memories escape
now go, tomorrow's due
pay and go easy
i hate your demands
hope they don't get too...
out of hand
INSTRUMENTAL
silence relieves me
speaks when i can't
tells me it's getting...
out of hand
end
