My face turned pale before the cold eyes of death
My body was frozen by the stare from the dark
I don't want to think of anything, but there's storm of thoughts in my head
I wasn't prepared for this, 'cause I'm not ready to die
Nothing could have prepared me for this

Nothing but blood so red and deceased
Nothing but pain, I fall on my knees
Tormenting demons, I suffer and bleed
Only way out is through window of dreams

The rain whips the lonely and crushed soul
The dark clouds are closing fast, the wind is blowing the colours of life away
The growing shadow will darken my dreams, and with the fire inside me it feeds
I'll be screaming in the stars when it's over
Storms are raging on the path to home, once so silent and calm
The desperate glare of the dark light is cast on the fallen one
And when the illusions sigh no more, the journey to new dream will carry on
'cause life is just a beautiful death

Life turns a new and strange page
They will try to take everything away from me
You'll never know the future
Save me from the rain
Tell me what matters in life, if anything
I'm struggling with sickness
They will try to take everything away from me
Are you trying to hide from the end
Save me from the rain
Save me from the end

'Cause life will always be withering away from us
I want to be alone with you
And I'll give my heart to you, before I go
'cause life is just a beautiful, beautiful death
