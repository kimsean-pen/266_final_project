Crush,
Who's got a crush?
I like the way you blush
I like the way you bluff
Touch,
Each time we touch
I wanna take too much
Keep me up all night

I wanna scratch your surface
I wanna feel your groove
I wanna be your needle
I wanna lick your wounds
You wanna play with fire
Stick and poke tattoo
You wanna play my new girl
I wanna play with you

Cash,
Got harder cash
I like the way you crash
Your lips in to mine
Fast,
We drive too fast
You got a checkered purse
But I can let it slide

I wanna scratch your surface
I wanna feel your groove
I wanna be your needle
I wanna lick your wounds
You wanna play with fire
Stick and poke tattoo
You wanna play my new girl
I wanna play with you

Why'd you cut up all your clothes?
Tell me something no one knows
I don't owe you anything
But you're too much for me to let it rain
Ain't it fun
Memory

I wanna scratch your surface
I wanna feel your groove
I wanna be your needle
I wanna lick your wounds
You wanna play with fire
Stick and poke tattoo
You wanna play my new girl
I wanna play with you
