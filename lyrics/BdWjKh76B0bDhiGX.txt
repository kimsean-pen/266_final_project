I smell smoke that comes from a gun

It was a long time ago, could have happened to anyone
He was struck by a bullet and he melted into fluid

One thousand miles an hour, I'm just like anyone
I want to feel the road of tar beneath the wheel

Named extinction

And evolving from the sea would no be too much time for me
To walk beside you in the sun
I read something about a son of a gun
