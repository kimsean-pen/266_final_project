Wake me up
From an endless dream
It's a long flight home
It's a long way back
And a pleasant company

Is it me?
Or is it someone else?
I'm just some other man

Is it me?
Or am I lost again?
Reflection in the wind

Is it me?
Or is it someone else?
I'm just some other man

Is it me?
Or am I lost again?
Reflection in the wind

Follow routes from my old book
Circle in unknown
Searching till the end
Out in the cold

Is it me?
Or is it someone else?
I don't believe myself

Is it me?
Or am I lost again?
Reflection from the past

Is it me?
Or is it someone else?
I don't believe myself

Is it me?
Or am I lost again?
Reflection from the past
