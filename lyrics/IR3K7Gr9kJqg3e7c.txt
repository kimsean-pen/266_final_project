Time hasn't moved
not since the night I died
I'm walking my ghost
back to a frozen smile
Thinking out loud, whisper to no one
He knows he knows he knows I've been Untrue

Trapped in a frame,
captured like photographs
Everything's still just like how it was left
floating like fog, haunting my old life
he knows he knows he knows I've been untrue

He knows he knows he knows
Sees right through my ghost
The night I died our time froze
I walk back to him as my ghost

Time hasn't moved not since the night I died
I'm walking my ghost back to a frozen smile
I lay down my bones where we used to lay
But he knows he knows he knows I've been untrue

He knows he knows he knows
See's right through my ghost
The night I died our time froze
I walk back to him as my ghost

He knows just by the way I float in
Right from the very beginning
My times a record thats skipping
He must he must -oh!

He knows he knows he knows
See's right through my ghost
The night I died our time froze
I walk back to him as my ghost
I walk back to him as my ghost

I walk back to him as my ghost
