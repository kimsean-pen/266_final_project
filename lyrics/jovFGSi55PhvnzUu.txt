Woah, lift me higher
Woah, when I get down
Woah, lift me higher
Woah, oh

I swear to God that it might just be the death of me
Just count the reasons why I'm crazy, yeah, it's stressing me
I burn the pictures of myself like it could set me free
But I can't stop me 'cause I gotta reach my destiny, let go
I was dead, now I'm living because I've made my decision
No, I will not be a victim and I'm like yo
No, I don't need permission to elevate with decision
I'm 'bout to break through the ceiling

Cause I need something to lift me up when I'm down
I get lost in my head for so long, I can't get out
When I'm feeling like I'm crawling in my skin and sinking down
I need something to lift me up

I wanna elevate
Elevate
Watch me elevate
Woah, lift me higher
Woah, when I get down
Woah, lift me higher
Woah, oh (Watch me elevate)

I know they say that the best is always yet to come
But nothing happens, I can sit and wait until I'm numb
I get that feeling in my soul, then I cut and run
Cause I can't take another second, watch me elevate like "hey, yo"
Yeah, I'm taking this vision like a body is risen
No, I can't stop with this rhythm and I'm like "hey, yo"
No, I might need a prison, I won't succumb to these feelings
They keep attacking my feelings

I need something to lift me up when I'm down
I get lost in my head for so long, I can't get out
When I'm feeling like I'm crawling in my skin and sinking down
I need something to lift me up

I wanna elevate
Elevate
Watch me elevate like high
Woah, lift me higher
Woah, when I get down (Elevate)
Woah, lift me higher
Woah, oh (I wanna elevate)
