Where were you
When I was burned and broken
While the days slipped by
From my window watching
And where were you
When I was hurt and I was helpless
Because the things you say

And the things you do

Surround me

While you were hanging yourself
On someone else's words
Dying to believe in what you heard

I was staring straight
Into the shining sun

Lost in thought
And lost in time
While the seeds of life
And the seeds of change
Were planted
Outside the rain
Fell dark and slow
While I pondered on
This dangerous
But irresistible pastime
I took a heavenly ride
Through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past
And coming back to life
I took a heavenly ride
Through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
Headed straight
Into the shining sun
