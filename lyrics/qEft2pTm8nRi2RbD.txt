Drunk off your love
I don't remember getting home
This headache's too much
You're next to me but I'm alone

Can't shake this rust
Darling I don't like your tone
Have we lost touch?
Are we better on our own?

You're breaking my heart, I'm holding on tight
Some day we'll get it right, Someday We'll get it right.
I'd call you my darling but you put up a fight
Someday we'll get it right, someday we'll get it right.
Oh no here we go again singing
Someday we'll get it right, Someday we'll get it right.
We're so close tonight, hope someday we'll get it right.

Come on drink up
I'm giving you another shot
don't think we've had enough
We're filling this up to the top

You're breaking my heart, I'm holding on tight
Some day we'll get it right, Someday We'll get it right.
I'd call you my darling but you put up a fight
Someday we'll get it right, someday we'll get it right.
Oh no here we go again singing
Someday we'll get it right, Someday we'll get it right.
We're so close tonight, hope someday we'll get it right.

Hold me close love keeping me safe cause
Most days I've felt strange
I've got weight stuck on my shoulders
You are worth the pain
said you are worth the pain.

You're breaking my heart, I'm holding on tight
Some day we'll get it right, Someday We'll get it right.
I'd call you my darling but you put up a fight
Someday we'll get it right, someday we'll get it right.
Oh no here we go again singing
Someday we'll get it right, Someday we'll get it right.
We're so close tonight, hope someday we'll get it right
hope someday we'll get it right.
