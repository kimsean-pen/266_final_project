You see right through distorted eyes, you know you have to learn
The execution of your mind, you really have to turn
The race is run, the book is read, the end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old but you don't want to know

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why

They just tell you that you're on your own
And fill your head all full of lies

The people who have crippled you, you want to see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you and there's just no return

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why

They just tell you that you're on your own
And fill your head all full of lies

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why

They just tell you that you're on your own
And fill your head all full of lies

No one, no one. Nobody
No one, no one. Nobody
No one, no one. Nobody
No one, no one. Nobody
No one, no one. Nobody
