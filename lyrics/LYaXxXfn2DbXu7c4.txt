I shed my skin
When the party was about to begin
I'm light years away but I'm walking back tonight
Of all nights
When I should be feeling just right
Don't want to be in public
My head is full of chopstick
I don't like it

Something on my mind
Breaking open doors I had sealed up before
Something on my mind
Makes me run when I thought I'd run too far

Somebody shaking my tree
Maybe that somebody is me
I'm standing in the light but
I'm making a break for the shadows
On the cinema wall
They should be mine but I'm not that tall
Now I'm saying this in privaate
If I had a car I'd drive it
Insane

Something on my mind
Breaking open doors I had sealed up before
Something on my mind
Makes me run when I thought I'd run too far
