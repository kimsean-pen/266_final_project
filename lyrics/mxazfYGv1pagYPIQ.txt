Look the other way
The window's higher now
Touch the sky above for giving desire
Trust the cold in your hands
The fire burns inside
Until we meet without a sound
She whispers to you

Don't feel it the lash
The crush goes on
Don't tell me it's raining
She hang's on

Turn the other way
The window's further now
The edge of the world forgiving desire
And it's alright if you dare
I'll never meet you there

So off to get hold for sleep
—————
—————
meets me again
meets you again
The stranger to some
The —————

Don't feel it
Don't feel it
Don't feel it
Don't feel it
Don't feel the edge.
