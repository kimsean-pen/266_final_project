Sometimes I find myself in a crowded room
With good friends and a feeling this will end too soon
Some things just end too soon

I watch you fall asleep and never wake up
Don't take these memories or the people I love
Cause my god, we might not have much longer
We might not have much longer

No I'm not angry, no I'm not upset
All I'm saying is you tend to forget
How good you've got it, damn you've got it good
And you should, cause no one deserves this

Right now, though things could be better it
Is a reminder that nothing here is permanent
We're dead or dying and I guess we'll never figure it out
Dead or dying, at least I'm trying
So hard not to dwell on the past
Breathe in every goodbye and try to make the memory last
Petrichor reminds me of when I was younger

There are two dates under your name
And life's the dash that's in between
And all the flowers that surround you
Will never bring back anything
But now and then, well I still miss you on the drive home
And still get anxious when I'm all alone
Faced with a feeling that I'll never know, where you go

Right now, though things could be better it
Is a reminder that nothing here is permanent
We're dead or dying and I guess we'll never figure it out
Dead or dying, at least I'm trying
So hard not to dwell on the past
Breathe in every goodbye and try to make the memory last
Petrichor reminds me of when I was younger

Right now, though things could be better it
Is a reminder that nothing here is permanent
We're dead or dying and I guess we'll never figure it out
Dead or dying, at least I'm trying
So hard not to dwell on the past
Breathe in every goodbye and try to make the memory last
Petrichor reminds me of when I was younger
