Late at night alone
I was hoping you would show
Just waiting for you
Try to catch a laugh
Out here on my own
There ain't nowhere else to go
I've checked in all the places you could hide
Late at night alone
I was hoping you would come from behind
Cause I don't want to stay
Out here on my own
I was hoping you would show up behind
We're headed the same way

It's all I want
It's all from dreaming
To keep you here forever

If I ever ride alone
I would never let go
Or everyone could see how hard I tried
I've never been so bold
But these feelings gotta go
I've never could a dream pass me by
The truth has now unfold
Shine a light
And lead me back away
The story's now told
The curtains unfold
Make it by and make sure that it stays
