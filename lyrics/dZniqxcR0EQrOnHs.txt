Aki ni nattemo aki tarinai kedo mou aki wa nai
Tsutsu uraura ibasho wa aru keredo ii basho ha mou nai
Danna san, tsuini anata to no en mo takenawa desuka
Natsu no hizashi,
karui yakedo no you ni akaku natta hada no kyoukaisen mo
Anata to onajiku atokata mo naku

[I'll find myself unsatisfied even
when autumn comes but there's no more room
All over there's places I can be at but there's no more good places
Husband, Is our relationship finally at its height?
The sunlight of summer and the
boundary line of my lightly burnt red skin
Leaves no traces just like you]

Ii aaru san suu

Tobikiri yuutsu na fuyu o sukippu shite
Sukisuki mo kisu mo sukippu shite
Nan no yaku ni mo tatanai yasashisa dake o shuutoku shite
Heyajuu ni shishu ga hodokosarete suteki
Konna daiji na toki ni kare wa mou inai ya

[Skip the extraordinarily melancholic winter
Skip the I love you's and kisses
Just learn how to be uselessly kind
The tapestry that decorates the room is lovely
Yet he's not here at such an important time like this]

Watashi tachi wa itsudemo doushite konna
ni zeitaku nanoka o shiru sube ga nai kara ne
Te ni hairanai to tada, hitasura ni kanashii

[We have no way of knowing why we're always this extravagant
Not getting what we want just leaves us completely sad]

I aru san suu
Ii aru xxsan su

[Acid in my stomach, I inhale
There are good things I like about Mr.xx]

Haru ni nattemo kekkyoku wasurerannai na
Nandaka gyaku ni omoi dashichau ne
Chuuto hanpa na namanurusa to mada
nokoro ano yoru ni nita tsumetai kaze
Anta no manazashi de karui yakedo no you ni akaku natta hoho no hou wa
Kisetsu ga meguttemo mada sukoshi ato ga nokotteru

[Even when spring comes I wont be able to forget in the end
I just end up remembering somehow
Cold winds similar to that night left with halfhearted warmth
These cheeks that burn light red from your gaze
Would still remain blushing even if the seasons revolve.]

Konna suteki na mono made subete utte shimau no?
Shinpai dakara eki ni tsuitara denwa suru ne

[You're even going to sell such a wonderful thing?
I'm worried so I'll call you after dipping in liquid]

Watashi tachi wa itsudemo doushite konna
ni zeitaku nanoka o shiru sube ga nai kara ne
Te ni haireru tame ni seri agatte yamanai
Hontou ni mietara uso demo yokatta no ni toka totsuzen
Kenkyo ni narareta tte tokkuni te okureda nesage wa dekinai
Saichen

[We have no way of knowing why we're always this extravagant
I keep raising my bid so I can get what I want
You could have just lied when you saw my bid
It's already too late to suddenly
become modest now. I can't lower my bid
Good bye]
