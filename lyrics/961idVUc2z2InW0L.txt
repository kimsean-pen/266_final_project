Time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is

Now you always say
That you want to be free
But you'll come running back (said you would baby)
You'll come running back (I said so many times before)
You'll come running back to me

Yeah, time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is

You're searching for good times
But just wait and see
You'll come running back (I said, don't worry darling)
You'll come running back (spend the rest of my life with you, baby)
You'll come running back to me

Go ahead baby, go ahead
Go ahead and light up the town
And baby, I do anything your heart desires, remember
I'll always be around
And I know, I know
Like I told you so many times before
You're gonna come back,
Yeah, you you're gonna come back baby

Knockin, Yeah, knocking right on my door
Yes

Time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is

'Cause I got the real love
The kind that you need
You'll come running back (I knew you would, baby)
You'll come running back (Like I told you before)
You'll come running back to me

Yeah, time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
I said, time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
Yeah, time, time, time is on my side
