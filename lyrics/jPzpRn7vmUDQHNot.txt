Well I don't wanna hang around with you
I've got my motor baby and I'm gonna see you through
You think I wanna be alone with you
It doesn't matter baby cause you're overreacted too
But since you're down there, where will I just be
I'm getting fine girl, dressing up for stormy weather

So touch me down in the past where my mother will last
And it's true that I'm in for a punch and a blast
Yeah down in the past where my mother will last
And she will make sure that you remember yeah yeah

Well I don't wanna slide away with you
I've got ten little soldiers pointing at you
Honey you just left me for a new one
It doesn't matter baby cause your hair is ugly too
But since you're down there, where will I just be
I'm getting fine girl, dressing up for stormy weather

So touch me down in the past where my mother will last
And it's true that I'm in for a punch and a blast
Yeah down in the past where my mother will last
And she will make sure that you remember yeah yeah

Well I don't wanna hang around with you
I've got my motor baby and I'm gonna see you through
You think I wanna be alone with you
It doesn't matter baby cause you're overreacted too

So touch me down in the past where my mother will last
And it's true that I'm in for a punch and a blast
Yeah down in the past where my mother will last
And she will make sure that you remember yeah yeah

That you remember...
Come on
