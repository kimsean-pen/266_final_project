Oh a warm hello
Would be apropos
We havent spoke in several weeks
But solitude tends to be the move
So you probably won't hear from me
And there was one relief in the changing tr
The contrails that cut the sky
But pre-arranged circumstances change
And l'd be lying if l said I'm fine
Catch her in the switchbacks in the line
Switching back to central standard time
Each day slightly more resigned
Trying to make some sense of life
So if we take off
You could quit your day job
We'd call ourselves the Angel Youth
You'll find us traveling and making tunes
But then I think of
All the people we've loved
How they'll be growing older soon
How it's true for me and you
So l convalesced in the middle west
And fell for Ohios roads
I'm standing still by the window sill
Where I once watched the world explode
So when it's looking dark in your narrative ar
I'm here and you can talk with me
A hackneyed fool under facist rule
Wasting days singing bout his dreams
All of which has lead me to believe
Earth's a set and life's the movie screen
And every dream that you have inbetween
They'll fade with every frame you see
Oh is it self-hate
wish I was in LA
Far from all the roads we knew
Unworried where we're going to
So if we take off
You could quit your day job
We'd call ourselves the Angel Youth
We're coming to a town near you
Lonely and outraged
Guess for now that I'll wait
For generation Angel Youth
To point me towards a higher truth

It's on the off-chance
We never come to cross hands
Cause it's too late to not pretend
And I'd for all of this to end
Just glad that I could be your friend
