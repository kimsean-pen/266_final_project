How can I explain
When there are few words I can choose
How can I explain
When words get broken
(Love)

Do you remember?
There was a time
When people on the streets
Were walkin' hand in hand in hand
They used to talk about the weather
Makin' plans together
Days would last forever

Come to me, cover me, hold me
Together we'll break these chains of love
Don't give up
(Don't give)
And don't give up
(Up)
Together with me and my baby
Break the chains of love

Do you remember?
Once upon a time
When there were open doors
An invitation to the world
We were fallin' in and out with lovers
Lookin' out for others
Our sisters and our brothers

Come to me, cover me, hold me
Together we'll break these chains of love
Don't give up
(Don't give)
And don't give up now
(Up)
Together with me and my baby
Break these chains of love
Together we'll break these chains of love

How can I explain
When there are few words I can choose
And how can I explain
When words get broken
We used to talk about the weather
Makin' plans together
Days would last forever

Come to me, cover me, hold me
Together we'll break these chains of love
And don't give up
(Don't give)
And don't give up now
(Up)
Together with me and my baby
Break the chains of love
(Yeah)
Together we'll break these chains of love

Don't give up
(Don't give up)
Don't give up now
(Give up)
Together with me and my baby
Break these chains of love
Together we'll break these chains of love

And don't give up
(Don't give up)
Don't give up now
(Don't give)
Together with me and my baby
Break these chains of love...
