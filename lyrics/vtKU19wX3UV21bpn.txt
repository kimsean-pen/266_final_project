Molly mixed up with them Xannies, I eat em like candy
Shit got me cranky, resemblence to Jesus uncanny
I'm in the alley, just smoking a fatty of dope
Now I'm in the valley, getting my dick sucked by a hoe
You know how that go
I'm from the land of the low lifes
Rather just die and have no life
Scrapping up scraps just to get by
Begging on corners to get high
Popping on somas, I'm too fried
Bitch wanna fuck but I'm too tired
We run from the cops, keep your shoes tied
Got that 9 on me, bitch, don't you even try

Slow riding with the windows up
That's the way I like the strut
Slow riding when the temp goes up
That's the way I like to fuck
Smoke a fucking whole blunt then ash in the nut
Bitch I'll roll another up, what you want lil slut?
Hoe they call me Yung Mutt, dead pimp with that ruby wrist
I'm ducking in the cut, don't show my face when i'm in public
I love to tag a toe and steal a motherfucker's plug and dip
And then I purchase every single motherfucking drug and flip 'em for a triple profit
Triple 6 until I'm covered up with bugs up in my fucking coffin
