La, la-la, la-la, la-la
I'm trying to control myself
So please, don't stand in my way
I've waited for the longest time
This is what I wanted in my way
Move over (move over), move over
There's a climax coming my way
Move over (move over), move over
There's a climax coming in my way-ay

I don't like you, don't compromise
Shattered by your weakness (shattered by your weakness)
Shattered by your smile (shattered by your smile)
And I'm not very fond of you
And your lies (lies)
Shattered by your weakness (shattered by your weakness)
Shattered by your smile (shattered by your smile)

All the kids are going back to school
The summer's over it's the golden rule
And now I'm coming out to play
So please, don't stand in my way
And all the things that seemed once to be
So important to me
Seem so trivial now that I can see
Move over (move over), move over
There's a climax coming my way
Move over (move over), move over
There's a climax coming in my way-ay
I don't like you, don't compromise
Shattered by your weakness (shattered by your weakness)
Shattered by your smile (shattered by your smile)
And I'm not very fond of you
And your lies (lies)
Shattered by your weakness (shattered by your weakness)
Shattered by your smile (shattered by your smile)
Shattered by your weakness (shattered by your weakness)
Shattered by your smile (shattered by your smile)
Shattered by your weakness (shattered by your weakness)
I'm shattered by your smile (shattered by your smile)
Shattered by your weakness (shattered by your weakness)
I'm shattered by your smile (shattered by your smile)
Please, don't stand in my way
