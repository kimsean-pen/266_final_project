It's Saturday and I'm feeling alone today
I wanna drink till I'm throwing up all night
I've got no friends, I've got no life I'm sitting at home
I need some friends, I wanna smoke

I wanna be the one to tell you im fine
I wanna be the one to say it's alright
I wanna see you almost every night
I wanna tell you ill be just fine

Ohooooohohhoohh

I wanna be the one to tell you I'm fine
I wanna be out of the house every night
But im too bummed to even try
Maybe im really not alright
