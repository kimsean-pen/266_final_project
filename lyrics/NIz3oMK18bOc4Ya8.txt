Darling, you can be so unforgiving
You can be so unloving
You can be misunderstanding
But i don't know how to feel without your love...

So tell me what to do do do do dodododo do do

It's a lovely night with the moon in the sky-e-oh

It's a lovely night with that look in your eye-e-oh

But you still sleep with your back to me.
Is it me and you?

Or is it me and the moon?
Oh baby, I thought that you forgave me
I thought that you still loved me

Don't you need me?...

I want it forever, It's a lovely night with the moon in the sky-e-oh

It's a lovely night with that look in your eye-e-oh
But you still sleep with your back to me.
Is it me and you?
Or is it me and the moon?
It's a lovely night with the moon in the sky-e-oh
It's a lovely night with that look in your eye-e-oh
But you still sleep with your back to me.
Is it me and you?
It's a lovely night with the moon in the sky-e-oh
It's a lovely night with that look in your eye-e-oh
But you still sleep with your back to me.
Is it me and you?
Or is it me and the moon?.
