I cast a line when I saw you were drowning
Still you turned your back on me
Pulled you from the fire when you were burning
Still you never could believe

So carry on
If you must go your way
Though it breaks my heart
Your free will still remains

Saved you from the fall when you were slipping
Still you broke from me to run
So how can you justify the life you're living?

You must carry on
If you must go your way
Though it breaks my heart
Your free will still remains

You'll deny it all
You'll deny me once again
But I've seen it all
I know you'll come to crawl
Back to me before the end

Carry on
If you must go your way
Though it breaks my heart
Your free will still remains
So carry on
If you must go your way
Though it breaks my heart
Your free will still remains
