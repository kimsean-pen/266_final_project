If we're not moving forward
What are we moving for?
Feels like we're losing order
Fighting a losing war

We need to work this out
Can't do this by myself
How did we let it go this far?

Hey
You know it's not too late for us to make a change
You gotta listen to your heart what does it say?
No matter how much we might bend we will not break
'Cause we got what it takes to stay

I know we got the power
Masters of our own fate
Together we are stronger
As long as we got faith

Hey
You know it's not too late for us to make a change
You gotta listen to your heart what does it say?
No matter how much we might bend, we will not break
'Cause we got what it takes to stay

Stay with me now
And how you like it now?
Just stay with me now
We're looking out
We're looking out, we're looking out now
Stay with me now, with me with me now
Stay we're looking out
Looking out, looking out, looking out

Hey
You know it's not too late for us to make a change
You gotta listen to your heart what does it say?
No matter how much we might bend, we will not break
'Cause we got what it takes to stay

We're looking out
We're looking out
Stay with me now
We're looking out, we're looking out, we're looking out now
Stay we're looking out
We're looking out
Stay, we're looking out, looking out, stay, yeah
