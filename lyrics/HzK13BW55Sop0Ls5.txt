I want so much
So much
So love me in disguise
But now you're just somebody else
All the lies I tell myself
You're impossible
There's so much in your blood
I'm here to help you let it out
I'll cut you up all night baby girl if I'm allowed
I'll use the same weaponry that you used on me
Impossible
Impossible
You're impossible
Impossible
You're impossible
Impossible
You're impossible
Impossible
I know enough
Enough
What more can I make?
Now I'm just somebody else
Feed the lions to myself
Impossible
Impossible
You're impossible
Impossible
You're impossible
Impossible
You're impossible
Impossible
Cut you up all night
(You're impossible)
Cut you up all night
Cut you up all night
I'll cut you up all night
Cut you up all night
(Now I'm just somebody else)
Cut you up all night
(Feed the lions to myself)
Cut you up all night
(You're impossible)
Cut you up all night
Cut you up all night baby girl
(You're impossible)
Cut you up all night baby girl if I'm allowed
I'll cut you up all night
Oh if I'm allowed
