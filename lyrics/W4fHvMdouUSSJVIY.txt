Mine (mine), mine (mine), mine, yeah mine (mine)
I can't seem to live without your love
Suffocating here by myself, dying for your touch
Springtime eyes that get you every time
And I just can't seem to give you up you're mine
You make me feel our love would never end
How can I forget, baby we were the best
Suffered dreams of you all through the night
And baby I can't seem to give you up you're mine
I can't seem to give you up you're mine
Baby you're mine (I can't seem to give you up you're mine)
Summer days and summer nights
When I felt you in my arms
Didn't I want you badly?
Wanted to let you have me
Autumn days and stormy nights
When you crush me with your charms
Didn't I need you madly?
Now I'm lying fall apart
I can't seem to live without your love
Suffocating here by myself, dying for your touch
Springtime eyes that get you every time
And I just can't seem to give you up you're mine
Boy you make me feel our love would never end
How can I forget, baby we were the best
I suffered dreams of you all through the night
And baby I can't seem to give you up you're mine
(I can't seem to give you up you're mine)
Baby you're mine (I can't seem to give you up you're mine)
Ah you make me feel
Like love would never end
Tell me how can I forget that?
My baby, we were the best
I suffered dreams of you all through the night
And baby I can't seem to give you up you're mine
(I can't seem to give you up you're mine)
(I can't seem to give you up you're mine)
