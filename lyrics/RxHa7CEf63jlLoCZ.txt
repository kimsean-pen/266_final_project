Retrieve your sight
Dazed by beliefs
You will not reach your shielded mind
Regain the light
That once burned inside
Don't feed the shadows of your mind
Tear down your walls

Push your prejudice aside
Burn trees of hate down to the ground

Tear them down
Don't await a miracle, turn aims into action
Seek what's right
We're keepers of the sacred laws, for nothing escapes our sight

Duobus locis in mente aderis

Retrieve your sight
As dazed by fear
You will dismiss your inner guide
Open the gate
For the prosecution
Sentence your inner fear to death
Tear down your walls

Push your bias to the side
Burn trees of hate down to the ground

Tear them down
Don't await a miracle, turn aims into action
Seek what's right
We're keepers of the sacred laws, for nothing escapes our sight

Duobus locis in mente aderis

Align with me
Melt light with darkness
Make sure you won't die in the harness
Do not fear the desire to leave your cage

When the path is not so clear
Walk without fear
Trust in your guide

Fly with me
We dominate illusions, we're bending the whole truth
To show what's right
We're masters of the universe, the outcome is in our might

Alternam formam corporis adsume

Tear down your walls
