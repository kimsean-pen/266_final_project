smile and say forever
laugh 'cos you mean never
ruined by so much honey
stuck and it's not funny

lie if you're clever
joke until whenever
please him everyday
don't let him go away

love to stay, love to stay
love to stay with you
love to stay, love to stay

sigh 'cos it's for never
die until it's over
ruined by so much honey
stuck and it's not funny
