Well the ink in my pen ran dry long before your smile
And the pages have always been blank like the trees in the wild
But the wind, yes the wind keeps pushing you and me
Time in time, I know when it's time to leave

If the memories we make, will never been lost, no
And the look on your face, we both knew the cost
But the wind, yes the wind keeps howling

I put in the pictures, you put in the time
You put all those memories so deep inside my mind
Now the wind, yes the wind keeps pushing you and me
And time in time, I know when it's time to leave

And the memories we've made, will never be lost, no
And the look on your face, we both knew the cost
But the wind, yes the wind keeá¹—s howling

Even if it was a mistake, I can't forget your face
Even if it was just a day, you won't forget the one who's making you shake

Kinda lost my way you see
Kinda lost my way you see
Kinda lost my way you see
Kinda lost my way you see
Even if it was a mistake, I can't forget your face
Kinda lost my way you see
Even if it was just a day, you won't forget the man who's making you shake
Kinda lost my way you see
Who's making you shake, you shake
Ah, making you shake
You shake
Ah, making you shake
