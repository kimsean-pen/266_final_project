If anybody asks I am to be left alone.
Alone from all of you and to the rest of the world.
There is a difference from lonely and
alone, to fill the empty void in your soul.
But can't I find happiness in myself?
Intrinsically self sustainable, emotionally free and available.
The brain replaced by the ego,
trapped in illusionary selfish world,
constantly judging and falling short always.
The mind will never stop replaying the past,
the constant background static that perpetuates painfully all that I
lack. "true salvation is a state of freedom from fear,
from a perceived state of lack, insufficiency;
therefore from all wanting needing,
grasping and clinging" You see time as a the means to
salvation whereas in truth it is the greatest obstacle to salvation.
The visions that I've seen are merely
pipe dreams of a god or a lack thereof.
But what is salvation but a dream of a god or lack thereof.
All the hallucinations,
all of the time I've spent alone
provide pain and sorrow followed by euphoria.
Just like I came into this world, all by myself, I will leave here.
The past cannot survive in your
presence, it can only survive in your absence.
