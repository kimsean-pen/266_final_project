I was born in another world
Strictly connected to a piece of my mind
Nothing more than a little land
It is a small cradle where I'm a kid
I am the princess in there
Nothing wrong in my fantasy world
I am the king the nation
No dictators or religions

No laws laid down for me
I have my own liberty inside of me
Nothing to lose I only fear

As you see I'm the only survivor in this land
As you see I'm the only survivor in this land

When did I hear this wind before
Change like this to a deeper roar
I'm starting to bleed another way
I just need some time to complete myself

These spotlights are here again
I can't see anything, I'm blind
This nature of time and space
Makes me sick of the situation

I couldn't know if I
If I will be strong enough for this
I have to choose do I want to live here

As you see I'm the only survivor in this land
As you see I'm the only survivor in this land
As you see I'm the only survivor in this land
As you see I'm the only survivor in this land

I couldn't know if I
If I will be strong enough for this
I have to choose do I want to live here

As you see I'm the only survivor in this land
As you see I'm the only survivor in this land
As you see I'm the only survivor in this land
As you see I'm the only survivor in this land
