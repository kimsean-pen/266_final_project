Oh, do you know?
Where to go?
Where to go?
Something on your mind
Wanna leave me behind
Wanna leave me behind

You're spinning me around
My feet are off the ground
I don't know where I stand
Do you have to hold my hand?
You mystify me, you mystify me, you mystify me

Oh-oh, when you walk into the room
It happened all so soon
I didn't want to know
Does he really have to go?
You mystify me, you mystify me, you mystify me, oh

And I didn't find the words to say, 'I love you'
And I couldn't find the time to say, 'I need you'
It wouldn't come out right
It wouldn't come out right
It just came out all wrong

Oh-oh, you're spinning me around
My feet are off the ground
I don't know where I stand
Do you have to hold my hand?
You mystify me, you mystify me, you mystify me

Oh, do you know?
Where to go?
Where to go, oh?
Something on your mind
Wanna leave me behind
Wanna leave me behind
