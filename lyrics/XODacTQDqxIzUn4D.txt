One day
I may
Find true love that will last forever
And ever

Till then
I'll spend
A lifetime of wishing us together
I never thought she'd say goodbye
And I'll never understand
The reasons why

Heart of mine
How will you keep from dying
Stop reminiscing
Who is she kissing
Heart of mine
Oh what's the use in trying
No one can mend you now

Love plays
Cruel games
I can't believe she's found another
To love her

Does she
Miss me
Sometimes I just can't help but wonder
If I could stop the hands of time
Then I'd know she'd always be
Forever mine

Heart of mine
How will you keep from dying
Stop reminiscing
Who is she kissing
Heart of mine
Oh what's the the use in trying
No one can mend you now

Heart of mine
How will you keep from dying
Stop reminiscing
Who is she kissing
Heart of mine
Oh what's the the use in trying
No one can mend you now
Oh Heart of mine
Oh Heart of mine
Oh Heart of mine...
