Do you remember
There was once a young woman
And she had loved you like no other before
When you were together
You were the heart and soul of the party

Now them days is over
Them times, them times are no more
Though you're gone I can still feel your presence
Least I think that's the way it should be
So wherever you are take a minute
Remember me, remember me

Sometimes it feels like I'm left in this darkness
God called your number and then he just turned out the light
Heaven embraced you and I know, I know that you're happy
But, oh I miss you, I miss, I miss you and I cry for you every night

Well, one day we will be reunited
Least I hope that is our destiny
So while you chill in the arms of angels
Remember me, remember me

Remember me, oh please
Remember me
Remember me
