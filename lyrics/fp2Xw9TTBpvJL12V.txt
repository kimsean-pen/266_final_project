One day I met an old man, he said to me
You gotta live while you can son, you gotta believe
'Cause when you're old and dying, it's no fun for you
You gotta live while you can 'til your days are all through

And I don't know why the cold wind blows
Man, I don't know about all I've read
I just know that our days are numbered
And this is what he said
I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head
I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head

One day I met a young man, he said: Get out of my way
I've got some living to do and there's no time to delay
'Cause when you're old and dying, it's no fun for you
You gotta live while you can til your days are all through

And I don't know why the cold wind blows
Man, I don't know about all I've read
I just know that our days are numbered
And this is what he said
I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head
I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head
I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head
I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head

So let's go
And I don't know why the cold wind blows
Man, I don't know about all I've read
I just know that our days are numbered
And this is what he said
I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head
I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head
I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head
I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head
It's ticking in my head
