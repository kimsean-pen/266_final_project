I can't find you
But can't fault you, 'cause I
Can get so caught up in my own head

You just float through, I can't catch you
And I can understand, but can't face the feeling
That I'm just another end

So when you coming home
I could be what you need girl, if you want me to
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

But I can float too, and I don't ask for much from you
But maybe that's too much, too soon
So I, keep rolling through the blackout
No fire without some fallout
Made peace out of the pieces
Now I can't take it back, no, no
But I keep on track now up, and yeah, that's all of it
I gave up my youth for this 'cause I wanted it, and...
If you think that I need you then you're out of your head
But I want you

So bring me down and drown me out
I'll be waiting here when you're ready
And I'll lay me down, unfinished now
It hurts

So when you coming home
I could be what you need girl, if you want me to
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

Come back to you, come back to you
Oh, it's always you, gon' come back to you
Come back to you, gon' come back to you, yeah
Come back to you

So bring me down and drown me out
I'll be waiting here when you're ready
And I'll let me down, unfinished, yeah, yeah, oh

When you coming home
I could be what you need girl, if you want me to
If you'll let me
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you
