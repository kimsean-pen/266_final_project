I got a pizza on the way, bae, bae
I'm tryna lay, lay
Lil' lady, ayy, I brought a bouquet
Of the treefer
And I'm feelin' like we should d-d-duck away
Netflix and Dusse
And if I do say so myself
That ass a creature

Pink Caddy, Pepto Bismol-bile
Ting named Kali
That ass on Sunset Hill, a beautiful view
Unusual, I'm hooked onna reel, and you a be too
I'm Pookie, 'bout that coochie forreal
Okay cool
Yes I love the way you
Nourish the soul, you know
That ass look like a fuckin' grapefruit
Hittin' them push ups
So when I'm up in that wassup, wassup
You get whooped up, uh
Arch that thang
Like where I'm from
Been on my brain, Miss Serotonin
Livin' la vida with my lavita, feel like Ceddy
Liberate your limbs, eliminate your limits, let me
You feel just like lemonade on ice when I'm all sweaty
She like Smino boy I get it already

I got a pizza on the way, bae, bae
I'm tryna lay, lay
Lil' lady, ayy, I brought a bouquet
Of the treefer
And I'm feelin' like we should d-d-duck away
Netflix and Dusse
And if I do say so myself
That ass a creature
