We come to your shores over misty millennia
From hustlers to emperors
For power and pleasure
We carve through the cars
Dance around the Daily News
Cue in the Grande ballabile
Even your ten-ton tone rings home for Marco Polo

Slow down
From a thread of sky
Slow down
To the warp and weft your being
Slow down
You're beautiful, graceful, like no other
Pretty damned good as you are

Slow down
Friend of mine
Slow down
In a terrible hurry for change
Slow down
As you unravel your marvels
From evergreen gardens
Remember we loved you this way

To treasure it all, scroll out to see
In gold, fire, wood, clay and water
Your structure and flow, adagio to allegro
With leaves to the tide
In full moon, plum blossom, we salute to you

Slow down
From a thread of sky
Slow down
To the warp and weft of your being
Slow down
Dynamic and playful, you opened my eyes yeah
You're pretty damned good as you are

Slow down
Friend of mine
Slow down
Could you go for progression not pace
Slow down
As you unravel your marvels
Don't lose them all on the way

Mantoshan

Slow down
From a thread of sky
Slow down
To the warp and weft of your being
Slow down
You're beautiful, graceful, like no other
Pretty damned good as you are

Slow down
Friend of mine
Slow down
You're in a terrible hurry to change
Slow down
Unravel your marvels, from evergreen gardens
Remember we loved you this way

Whoa, to the warp and weft of your being
You're beautiful, graceful, like no other
P-p-pretty damned good as you are

Xizi she knows that once it's gone, then it's gone
Xizi she knows that once it's gone, then it's gone
Xizi she knows that once it's gone
Then it's gone.
