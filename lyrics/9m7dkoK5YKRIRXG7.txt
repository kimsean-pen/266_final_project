I just don't care anymore
I've reached the end of the rope
I just don't care anymore
Won't cry these tears anymore

Can't find it in the Bible
Can't find it on TV
Can't find it in diamonds
There's something inside me
That just went around it

Can't find it in music
Can't find it in my soul
Can't find it in chocolate
Oh babe I can't hide it
I can't even fight it and yeah

I just don't care anymore
I've reached the end of the rope
I just don't care anymore
Won't cry these tears anymore

There's no way she can kiss you
The way that I do
I heard that you miss me
Oh you should be careful
Of whom you've been talking to

Long nights without you
Have taught me to be strong
I've cut all my losses
Think no more about it
'Cause I couldn't fight it and yeah

I just don't care anymore
I've reached the end of the rope
I just don't care anymore
Won't cry these tears anymore

There was a time I thought I'd die
If you should ever leave me high and dry
And you don't want me anymore
It's time to settle the score

I just don't care anymore
I've reached the end of my temper
I'm tired of the letters
I just don't care anymore
Won't cry these tears anymore

I just don't care anymore
I've reached the end of my rope
And it's time that I've taught you so
I just don't care anymore
Won't cry these tears anymore

It's time to settle the score
