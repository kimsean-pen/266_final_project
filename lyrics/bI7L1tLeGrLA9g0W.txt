I learned a lot inside a year
That handful of months
Another turn around the sun
I'm still cold and burning up
Like a raisin in the sun
And I'm numb from smoking blunts
I don't feel it when they hit me
Way my father used to beat me
I don't think I'd really feel it
If a car swerved and hit me
What does God got against me
I've been doing stupid shit like
... and selling...
I even tried to rob a bitch that got
Raided by police
I'm just glad it wasn't me
And that keep me up at night
But I'm used to losing sleep
Because I live inside a house
That's full of water neck deep
So I'm always fucking fighting
To keep my head above the water
If I could walk on top of oceans
I'd change the whole world and make it better for my mother
And get a message from my sister
That's just fucking fiction
She out there flirting with addiction
She don't got no time to call me
Me you and our father
All hopeless alcoholics
If you get a chance to call me
Just remember that I love you
And I'll always be your brother

And there were times that I didn't want to live
Thank God I'm alive
And to them times that I didn't want to live
Thank God I'm alive
For all them times that I didn't want to live
Thank God I'm alive
And to them times that I didn't want to live
Thank God I'm alive

I remember being young
I'd ask a lot of questions
Like why's there so much hatred
And why they call me crazy
Mama said I fell from heaven
Smacked my head on the pavement
And that's why they call me crazy
But that's why I love you baby
And the day you stop fighting
That's the day you turn crazy
I could never pay you back
But I'ma start with a Mercedes
When I blow up I'mma get you everything you wanted now
It'll never be the same
Riding through H-town
Got a chevy full of gas
Roll the windows down
Hope I find some peace of mind
'fore the sun goes down

And there were times that I didn't want to live
Thank God I'm alive
And to them times that I didn't want to live
Thank God I'm alive
For all them times that I didn't want to live
Thank God I'm alive
And to them times that I didn't want to live
Thank God I'm alive
