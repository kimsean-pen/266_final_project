I, I used to hide away, from anything that I, I thought would hurt me
I, I used to find my way, cause not everything will always burn me
Each time I get closer I pushed it all away, but we get the
Chance to start over each and everyday

No one has to think, before they breathe so I am not gonna
stop myself before I reach, if it all falls down I dont feel
The ground, thats not new to me, get back up on my feet and
I'm running x3 no catching up to me, I'm running x3 i'm right
were I'm supposed to be, running x3 you know I gotta keep,
Running x3 you know I gotta kepp...

Love I'm ready for the chase
But now I don't know if you can keep up with my pace

Each time you got closer I pushed you far away
But we get the chance to start over
Each and everyday

Baby, I was wrong
Walked away from you for my protection
Now I, all my faer is gone and I'm heading in the right
Direction, Running

No one has to think, before they breathe so how am I gonna
Stop myself before I reach, If it all falls down I dont feel
The ground, thats not new to m, get back up on my feet and
I'm running x3 no catching up to me, I'm running x3 I'm right
Where I'm supposed to be Running x3 you know I gotta keep,
Runnning x3 you know I gotta keep...
