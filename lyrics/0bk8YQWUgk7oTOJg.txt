You were alone, left out in the cold
Clinging to the ruin of your broken home
Too lost and hurting to carry your load
We all need someone to hold

You've been fighting the memory, all on your own
Nothing worsens; nothing grows
I know how it feels being by yourself in the rain
We all need someone to stay
We all need someone to stay

Hear you, falling and lonely, cry out
Will you fix me up? Will you show me hope?
At the end of the day you were helpless
Can you keep me close? Can you love me most?

You've drunk it down and you've spat it out
And nothing tastes like the things you had
So tear it off, why don't you let them go?
We all need someone to stay
We all need someone to stay

Hear the fallen and lonely cry out
Will you fix me up? Will you show me hope?
At the end of the day we're helpless
Can you keep me close? Can you love me most?
Can you keep me close? Can you love me most?
Can you keep me close? Can you love me most?

You were alone, left out in the cold
Clinging to the ruin of your broken home
You were falling and lonely, cry out
Will you fix me up? Will you show me hope?
The end of the day and we're helpless
Can you keep me close? Can you love me?

Hear the fallen and lonely cry out
Will you fix me up? Will you show me hope?
At the end of the day we're helpless
Can you keep me close? Can you love me most?
Can you keep me close? Can you love me most?
Can you keep me close? Can you love me most?
