Say that you want me here
And I'll find a door
Then you open up my hand
Where you wanna go

Can we start all our time over again
Can we start all our time over again

Make our way up to the roof
Been awake for days
In the shadow of the night
I wanna fade away

Can we start all our time over again
Can we start all our time over again
