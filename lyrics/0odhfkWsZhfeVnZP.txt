So you wanna play
Games with my head, but you make me fall apart
And wish that I was dead, I just can't believe I fell
For such a blackened heart
You played me for a fool
And used me from the start, fuck it all (fuck it all)
I just want to know the truth
But the words from your mouth they just cloud
All the negativity
Forces me down into (silence), but still I can dream
I wanna know, I wanna know

If I tear you open wide
Take a look inside, are you pretty?
Can I get inside your mind
See what I can find, are you pretty?
So just take off that disguise
Everyone knows that your only
Pretty on the outside

Now I fucking hate you with all of my heart
So just disappear
And never will I fear for my life
I just want to be alone
And never no never
Will I be unhappy and low
I wanna know, I wanna know

If I tear you open wide
Take a look inside, are you pretty?
Can I get inside your mind
See what I can find, are you pretty?
So just take off that disguise
Everyone knows that your only
Pretty on the outside

You're so pretty on the outside
You're so pretty on the outside

So you wanna play
Games with my head, but you make me fall apart
Wish that I was dead
I can't believe I fell for such a blackened heart
Played me for a fool and just used me from the start
I just wanna know the truth (but the words from your mouth)
All your negativity (you keep forcing me down)
Into silence I can dream (into silence I can dream)
Into silence I can dream

If I tear you open wide
Take a look inside, are you pretty (pretty)
Can I get inside your mind
See what I can find, are you pretty (pretty)
So just take off that disguise
Everyone knows that your only
Pretty on the outside

You're so pretty on the outside
You're so pretty on the outside
You're so pretty on the outside
