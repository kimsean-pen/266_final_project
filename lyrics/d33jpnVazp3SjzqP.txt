Melancholy
aviation
chocolate
perfume
cigarettes
frequent flyer
stow away
dislocation
sleeping
jets
wave goodbye
feel homesick
tranquilizers
bill of fare
cry easy
dvt
disapear into thin air

We wish you all a very happy pleasant flight
this is a journey to the center of the night
and the inflight entertainment's out of sight
here on af 607105

Time difference
you're waking
chase the sun into your eyes

Sleeping cities
dust hotel rooms
passengers look to the skies

Fly over
your lifetime
and never touching down

My heart
is breaking
somewhere over saskatchewan

We wish you all a very happy pleasant flight
this is a journey to the center of the night
and the inflight entertainment's out of sight
here on af 607105

Your life in
the wrong hands
savannah and frozen wastes

the flight path
the wingspan
below the earth rotates

I love you
i miss you
i cannot see your face

Invent a
new persona
drunk here on the edge of space

All the things i carry with me
and all the things i left behind
and all the things that wait to meet me
hover in the air tonight

If i can only keep on moving
and never stop and think of me
and freefall through the years and decades
terminal velocity
chorus
we hope you had a very happy pleasant flight
this is our final destination so goodnight
like a stone we are now falling from the sky
farewell from af 607105

The cabin
is burning
i smile and feel complete

Here amongst
total strangers
27 000 feet

Suspended
isolation
kids throw toy planes in the street

One final
blaze of glory
viewed from a window seat
