This is the faith complex,
Where all it takes is another step so we can then step again
It's not all about the numbers
This is the faith complex,
Try not to write another disappointing letter to integrity,
Only go faster when you've stopped and thought,
Only go slower when you've learned of wisdom.

Everything is a question of goodwill,

It's not all about the numbers,
What should we ask for?
Who should we look to if all we know is burning bridges?

With roots above and branches below,
Don't run if you don't know your walk,
This is the faith complex,
This is a memoir to friends persisting.
