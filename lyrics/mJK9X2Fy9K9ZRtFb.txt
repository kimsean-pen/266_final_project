Here, lonely and marooned
Here, howling at the moon
So I'll wait in silence, silence, silence

There's footprints in the snow
I'll follow wherever you go
I'll be the lonely wolf
I'll follow wherever you go

In the silver night
The silver night
In the silver night
The silver night

Here, not a single light
Here, in the darkest night
And the sound of silence, silence, silence

Here, this is where I reign
Hear me calling out no name
So I'll stay in silence, silence

There's footprints in the snow
I'll follow wherever you go
I'll be the lonely wolf
I'll follow wherever you go

In the silver night
The silver night
In the silver night
The silver night

Here, lonely and marooned
I will wait
In silence, silence, silence

There's footprints in the snow
I'll follow wherever you go
I'll be the lonely wolf
I'll follow wherever you go

In the silver night
The silver night
In the silver night
The silver night

In the silver night
The silver night
