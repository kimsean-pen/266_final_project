You can't erase
A blank slate
You flip a coin and make your choice
It's been a while since you made your mark
You've gotten used to pissing in the dark
But you can't go back so you just
Look for a door on the current day
In a river of endless hallways
Your dull blade and your dusty attire
Can bring back all those burning desires
So go back to the pit or roll over

There's no finish line for a divided heart
Feel the horns in your side

Pick up another cigarette
Smoke it now and soon you'll forget
If only your silver lining had better timing
'Cause there's no crown for one on the way down

Just look at its eyes

Light another cigarette
Smoke it now and soon you'll forget
If only your silver lining had better timing
Cause there's no crown for one on the way down
