A cold night with terrifying shadows
Buried by centuries of oblivion
Horrible, ancient and dark
Death winds surround me

Dwelling in this forgotten grave
In these endless torments
Beyond the mysteries of mankind
Frightening and grimly real

Draped in torn dusty rags
I awake from the earth
Deathly cold
Deathly pale

NightEvil
Blood is mine

Searching for blood across the night
My soul has died some years ago
From the dust covered tombstone
The funeral yells of the Eternal

Eternal is the essence of evil
Immortal is now my cold corpse
Through the funeral mist I wander
Far from the feeble mortal

I walk in the mist as an inhuman creature
The fog of death surrounds my corpse

Night hides a so beautiful realm ignored from humans
Night breeds the abomination of sin as real as death
And by the light of the moon shine my dead eyes
Hear the call of a melancholic vampire far, so far

And in my coffin
Missing human blood in my throat
Through eternities of sorrow
I keep on hating

Dwelling through the tombs
Above the humans
Beyond any time
Cold, forgotten and alone

By some cold rainy night
You can see
A gaunt face covered with tears
Deathly cold
Deathly pale
