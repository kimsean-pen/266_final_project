Santana: It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now here's another one
So your melody
Will play on and on

Santana with Tina & Brittany: With the best of 'em

Santana (Tina & Brittany harmonizing): You are beautiful, like a dream come alive,
Incredible

Santana with Tina & Brittany: A sinful, miracle, lyrical

Santana: You've saved my life again

Santana with Tina & Brittany: And I want you to know, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat

Santana (Tina & Brittany harmonizing): Constantly,
Girl, you played through my mind like a symphony
There's no way to describe
What you do to me,
You just do to me
What you do me

Santana: And it feels like I've been rescued (Tina & Brittany: Rescued)
I've been set free (Tina & Brittany: Set free)
I am hypnotized (Tina & Brittany: Hypnotized)
By your destiny (Tina & Brittany: Destiny)
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful
You are...(Tina & Brittany: Are)
And I want you to know baby (Tina & Brittany: I want you to know)

Santana with Tina & Brittany: I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you (Santana: I love you) like a love song, baby (Santana: I love you)
And I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (Santana: Like a love song)

Santana (Tina & Brittany harmonizing): No one compares
You stand alone, to every record I own
Music to my heart that's what you are

Santana with Tina and Brittany: A song that goes on

Santana: And on...

Tina & Brittany: I, I love you like a love song, baby (Santana: Oh... I)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Santana: I love you)
I, I love you (Santana: I love you) like a love song, baby (Santana: Like a love song)
And I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (Like a love song)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Santana: I love you like a love song, baby)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Santana: Like a love song, baby)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Santana: Yeah... yeah...)
And I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (Santana: Like a love song)
