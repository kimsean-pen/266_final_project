Just a step toward you, you know you can't
You have to lift what's only real
Can't stop the world and start again
You have to feel what's only real

You've gotta take life by the hand
Let the substance close you in
Hope to one day come alive
You have to take life by the hand
Hope to one day understand

Don't stop the world, you know you can't
You have to feel what's only real
Can't stop the world and start again
You have to feel what's only real
