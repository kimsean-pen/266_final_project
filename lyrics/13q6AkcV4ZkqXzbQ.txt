I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight
Set the universe on fire
There's no end in sight
Bring me to the holy raging power
Where I find my destiny
The universe on fire
You're my guiding light

Carrying the breath of fire
Within the lungs of steel
Soaring to light the flame
Forged by cosmic ordeal
Ascending on mighty dragon
With metal wings and claw
In a great battle foregone
One thousand years ago

Now lead me to the stars
Atomic flame ignite my heart

I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight
Set the universe on fire
There's no end in sight
Bring me to the holy raging power
Where I find my destiny
The universe on fire
You're my guiding light

Gliding across the sun
To soak up all its might
Charging my solar gun and
Prepare for epic fight
Questing through nebulas
In search for crystal stone
That gives me the overdose
Of force to claim space throne

It is time to take up your arms
Nova bombs and plasma guns

I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight
Set the universe on fire
There's no end in sight
Bring me to the holy raging power
Where I find my destiny
The universe on fire
You're my guiding light

Set me on fire

I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight
Set the universe on fire
There's no end in sight
Bring me to the holy raging power
Where I find my destiny
The universe on fire
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light
