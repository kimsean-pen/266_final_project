My heart is made of wine
Quick to love with open mind
Don't tell me it's wrong if I need you
When I used to live just to breathe you
You're losing touch of my view
Don't tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong

My love is cruel
Always pulling me too deep
Selfish and rude
Never thinks of what I need
I keep falling every first sight
'Cause my love is cruel
Always pulling me too deep

You know I'll be alright
Friends don't need each others' nights
Don't tell me I'm wrong if I need you
When you were the one who would pursue
We're better without, I believe you
But don't tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong

My love is cruel
Always pulling me too deep
Selfish and rude
Never thinks of what I need
I keep falling every first sight
'Cause my love is cruel
Always pulling me too deep

I'm tearing from logic that keeps me afloat when
Your hollowing sighs plunge me back in the ocean
Just keep me okay, just keep me knowing
That I know how to breathe even when my head's going
Just keep me okay, just keep me knowing
That I know how to breathe even when my head's going
Just keep me okay, just keep me knowing
That I know how to breathe even when my head's going
Just keep me okay, just keep me knowing
My love is cruel
That I know how to breathe even when my head's going
Selfish and rude
I keep falling every first sight
'Cause my love is cruel, cruel
