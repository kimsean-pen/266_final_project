If you wanna be with a guy who's gonna bring you flowers
A guys who's gonna talk on your phone for hours
A guys who's gonna wanna hold the door for you
When you wanna walk through
A guys who's gonna pick you up
A guy who's gonna take you out and make you
Wanna get a little dressed up and get a little down
I wanna be the guy with the roses
Number on speed dial, ladies first, don't you know that's my style
Hop into my truck I got plans
Well head on down to Jimmy's and we'll do a little dance
There's a lot of things in a small town a guy can be
But if its by your side for the rest of my life
Baby you can call me, a wannabe (a wannabe)
Be be a wannabe (a wannabe) (a wannabe)
Be Be
If you wanna be with a guy whose gonna give you
The whole world from the back of a dirt road farm
Scribbled in ink with a big heart a tattoo on my arm
I'm talkin' kissin' like crazy, can't shut it down
Can't you see how
I wanna be the guy that your out with
Arm that's your names on
Be the lips baby that you wanna put your lips on
All day, all night, moonshine, sunrise, your favorite song
There's a lot of things in a small town a guy can be
But if its by your side for the rest of my life, baby you can call me
A wannabe (a wannabe) (a wannabe)
Be be a wannabe (a wannabe)
Be Be
I wanna be the guy you make a life with, picket white fence with
Maybe a little later hell even make a baby with
Just you and me livin' that life long dream
There's a lot of things in a small town a guy can be
But if its by your side for the rest of my life
Baby you can call me, a wannabe (a wannabe) (a wannabe)
Be be
You can call me your wannabe (a wannabe)
Be Be
A wannabe (a wannabe) (a wannabe)
Be Be
