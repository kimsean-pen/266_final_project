Shine my shoes, brother!

Furry little squirrel I need you
I don't think that I want to be you
I hate everybody get out of my kitchen
Lay down in the forest live with my affliction

And I cannot breathe
When you're there I can't see
When you're smiling to me
And I try to smile back

Hey aaah
Hey aaah
Hey aaah

Climbing sun shining keeping my head warm
Trying timing boy you have been warned
I hate other people get out of my bedroom
This was unforeseeable aching to be near you

I cannot breathe
When you're there I can't see
When you're smiling to me
And I try to smile back

But my lips hurt when I do
My lips hurt when I do
My lips hurt when I smile
My lips hurt when I smile

My lips hurt when I smile
My lips hurt when I smile
My lips hurt when I smile
My lips hurt when I

Hey aaah
Hey aaah
Aaah

Bass

Oah hey

I cannot breathe
When you're there I can't see
When you're smiling to me
When you're smiling to me

To me
To me

Hey aaah
Hey aaah
