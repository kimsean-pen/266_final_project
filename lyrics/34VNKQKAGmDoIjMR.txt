There's a bottom to the top of the moment
You won't always be around
Catch a nigga coming quickly behind you
People want you underground
Do you misbehave?
Haunt you to your grave
I'm going to eat you alive
Please don't find me rude
But I don't eat fast food
So don't run to me, baby

Just hide, Ooh!
You know that you're the one that's terrified, Ooh!
Just hide, Ooh!
You know that you're the one that's terrified, Ooh!

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up

Just hide, you know that you're the one, that's terrified
Just hide, you know that you're the one, that's terrified

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, please
Ooh-ohâ€”no, no, no, Ooh!
Oh you can't run from me
You can't hide from me
