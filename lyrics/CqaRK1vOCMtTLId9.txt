Bob Marley, why'd you have to go?
A-go-go-go
Why wouldn't you let them amputate your little toe-whoa-whoa?
The world still needs to learn to get along
A-long-long-long
But thanks for tryin' to save us with a reggae song

So far, so bad, so what?
I just can't believe it
We're here, you're gone
And I just can't believe it
It just gets so hard livin' in this Babylon
And so I sing my song

Bob Marley, why'd you have to go?
A-go-go-go
Why wouldn't you let them amputate your fuzzy little toe-whoa-whoa?
The world still needs to learn to get along
A-long-long-long
But thanks for tryin' to save us with a reggae song
Thanks for tryin' to save us with a reggae song
Bob Marley

"I wish that song was longer!"
"No you don't"
Yeah
Listen up people, and I will deal well
When reggae music is live and direct
Peace and love is in full effect
So treat your fellow human with respect
And every little thing's gonna be alright
Could you be loved? Well, I think so
Are we gonna make it? Only Raja know
