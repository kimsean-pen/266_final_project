I've never been afraid of the highest heights
Or afraid of flying high
I've never been afraid of the wildest fights
Not afraid of dying
But now I want off this ride 'cause she's scaring me
And I don't like where we're going

I need a new funfair, 'cause she's scaring me

And I don't like where we're going
And now you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me
I guarantee you miss me

'Cause you changed the way you kiss me
'Cause you changed the way you kiss me
We used to be so so useful
Out green on the background vocals
Tea-total, on the next high
We get by with our so-called soul mate
Made for each other chit-chat

But that dried up white socks
With the cutting edge facts
Now I'm chilling on my Jack Jones

Looking for a way back home but I can't get back
Our love feels wrong, please wind me back
Our love feels wrong can't hide the cracks
I guarantee you miss me
'Cause you changed the way you kiss me
I've never been afraid of the highest heights
Or afraid of flying high
I've never been afraid of the wildest fights
Not afraid of dying
I need a new funfair
'Cause she's scaring and I don't like where we're going
I guarantee you'll miss me
'Cause you changed the way you kiss me
'Cause you changed the way you kiss me
Our love feels wrong, please wind me back
Our love feels wrong can't hide the cracks
I guarantee you miss me
'Cause you changed the way you kiss me
I guarantee you miss me
'Cause you changed the way you kiss me
