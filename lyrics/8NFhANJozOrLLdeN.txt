I wanna go to Magnolia Mountain
And lay my weary head down, down on the rocks
On the mountain my Savior made

Steady my soul and ease my worry
Hold me when I rattle like a hummingbird hummin'
Tie me to the rocks on the mountain my Savior made

Lie to me, sing me a song
Sing me a song until the morning comes
And if the morning come, will you lie to me
Will you take me to your bed, will you lay me down
Till I'm heavy like the rocks on the riverbed
That my Savior made for us

I wanna be the bluebird singing
Singing to the roses in her yard
The roses in her yard her father grew for her

It's been rainin' that Tennessee honey
So long I got too heavy to fly
There ain't no bluebird ever get too heavy to sing

Lie to me, sing me a song
Sing me a song until the morning comes
And if the morning don't come, will you lie to me
Will you take me to your bed, will you lay me down
Till I'm heavy like the rocks on the riverbed
That my Savior made for us
Please

We burned the cotton fields down in the valley
And ended up with nothing but scars
The scars became the lessons
That we gave to our children after the war

There ain't nothing but the truth
Up on the Magnolia Mountain where nobody ever dies
Steady your soul and ease your worry
They got a room for you

Lie to me, like I lie to you
Calm me down until the morning comes
And if the morning don't come lie to me
Will you take me to your bed, will you lay me down
All heavy like the rocks in the riverbed
That my Savior made for us
Please

For us, for me
For us, for me
