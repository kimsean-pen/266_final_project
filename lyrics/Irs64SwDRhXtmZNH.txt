You may call me crazy, but that's alright with me
Everyone I know swears that she's cheating on me
I'm just a sucker that fell in love with a liar
I'm flirting with danger, I'm playing with fire

I know I could do better,
But better's just whatever
When you find the one you love,
It doesn't matter if they tear you apart
Taking shots with every guy at the bar,
Taking photos of herself top down in the back of my car

I can't say that she doesn't get to me
I can't say it doesn't rip right through me
I know I could do better,
But better's just whatever
When you find the one you love,
It doesn't matter if they tear you apart

She hates me, but she wants me inside,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire
'Cause she's out of her mind
I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire, playing with fire

From the first time that I saw her,
I knew that I was in love
Got her name tattooed,
Got the mark of the beast on my arm
Down dirty likes to roll in the mud
Got a thirst for sweat an insatiable hunger for blood

Her curves they speak right to me
Her eyes they see right through me
I know I could do better,
But better's just whatever
When you find the one you love,
It doesn't matter if they tear you apart

She hates me, but she wants me inside,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire
'Cause she's out of her mind
I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire, playing with fire

Can't trust a liar, can't beat a cheater
Can't trust a liar, can't beat a cheater

She loves to take advantage of me
I don't, I don't, I don't to know why I love her, but I love her
I'm a sucker for pain, I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm...

She hates me, but she wants me inside,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire
'Cause she's out of her mind
I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire, playing with fire

Can't trust a liar, can't beat a cheater
I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire
Can't trust a liar, can't beat a cheater
I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire
