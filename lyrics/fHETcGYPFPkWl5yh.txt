I wanna do something for you
Like holding your hand while you're sleeping
But I can't shake the thought that burns in me
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone and

And I don't want to know your thoughts
I don't want a wailing heart
My life's a lie

I wanna heart of you and save your place
In my bed and I take you around then
But I'm a fallin', I know I can't do it
Alone, I'm alone, I'm alone now

And I don't want to know your thoughts
I don't want a wailing heart
My life's a lie

And as we lay down
The new drive is long
Where did we go, where did we go wrong
