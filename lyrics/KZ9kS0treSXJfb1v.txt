Do you really believe that you can never be sure?
They're leaving bodies in stairwells
Washing up on the shore
Do you really expect us to care what you're waiting for?
When you're high in your castle
Keeping an eye on the door
The door, the door

If I only see what I can see
I know it isn't there
And if only need what I can keep
I know it isn't fair

Oh, baby
You can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing
Oh, I will stop at nothing
And you can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing
No, I will stop at nothing now

Do you really believe that you are one of a kind?
If you don't have a heart I can offer you mine
Do you really expect that you will always be fine?
When you're high on your throne and
Never toeing the line, the line, the line

If I only see what I can see
I know it isn't there
And if only need what I can keep
I know it isn't fair

Oh, baby
You can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing
Oh, I will stop at nothing
And you can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing
No, I will stop at nothing now

Lookin' away, you're lookin' away
Lookin' away, you're lookin' away
Lookin' away, you're lookin' away
From all that we've done
Lookin' away, you're lookin' away
Lookin' away, you're lookin' away
Lookin' away, you're lookin' away
From all that we've done

Oh, baby
You can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing
Oh, I will stop at nothing
And you can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing
No, I will stop at nothing now

Lookin' away, you're lookin' away
Lookin' away, you're lookin' away
Lookin' away, you're lookin' away
From all that we've done
Lookin' away, you're lookin' away
Lookin' away, you're lookin' away
Lookin' away, you're lookin' away
From all that we've done

Lookin' away, you're lookin' away
Lookin' away, you're lookin' away
Lookin' away, you're lookin' away
From all that we've done
