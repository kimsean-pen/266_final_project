Boy, you got me so excited
Oh Boy, you're making it hard to hide it
I never fall too easily
Something about you makes me weak oh I
And I know you don't mind it

Don't think bad of me
Found someone finally to make it worth my time
Hold me and don't let me go
Boy, if you feeling it, just let me know
I could show you what you're missing, baby

I like the way you like it
I like the way you like it (like it, like it)
I like the way you like it
I like the way you like it (like it, like it)

Don't go misunderstanding
Oh know it's just that you're so distracting
All that you got is all that I want
Something about you makes me weak oh I
And I'll never let you go

Don't think bad of me
Found someone finally to make it worth my time
Hold me and don't let me go
Boy, if you feeling it, just let me know
I could show you what you're missing-

I like the way you like it (like it, like it)
I like the way you like it (like it, like it)
I like the way you like it (like it)
I like the way you like it (like it, like it)

Yea uh huh so did you know that
You've been running around inside my head?
And I just wanna crash into ya, ain't no accident
And boy, I know I come on a little bit strong, baby
I'd give it all to have you for my own eh

I know that you like my style
If you can handle it, take you for a ride
So, try me, I won't take you no surprises
I like the way you like it

I'll be straight, I want you, baby
No stopping 'til I got you, baby
I wanna hear it on your lips, feel your kiss
Don't keep me waiting
Say the word, take me higher
Show me, I'm not the only one

I like the way you like it (like it, like it)
I like the way you like it (like it, like it)
I like the way you like it
I like the way you like it (like it, like it)
I like the way you-
