Aww, yeah
(round and round)
(round it go)
I get around

Still clown with tha underground
When we come around
(round and round)
(round it go)
Stronger than ever
Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break they neck
To keep they hoes in check

Cuz, hoes, they sweat a brotha majorly and I don't know why, your girl keeps paging me

She tell me that she needs me
Cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me
Lady take it easy
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy

Ehh yo bus it, baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy

You ask why, it don't matter

My pockets got fatter
Now everybodys looking for the ladder
And ain't no need in be greedy

If you wanna see me
Try a beeper number baby when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky just be happy with this quicky

But when you learn, you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out
I get around
Whatcha mean, ya don't know

(round and round)
(round it go)
I get around
The underground just don't stop for hoes

I get around
(round and round)

(round it go)
I get around
Hey yo Shock, let them hoes know

Now you can tell from my everday fits, I aint rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)

I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
(a dime and a nickel)

Just cuz I'm a freak
Don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby, I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock-G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could sham me
I get around
What's up love, how you doin'? (alright)

Well I've been hangin' sangin', tryin' to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was bangin"
Your home girl you went to school with
That's cool, but did she tell you about her sister
And your cousin thought I wasn't
See, weekends was made for michelob
But it's a monday, my day
So just let me hit it, yo

And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep on the down low long as you know
That I get around
(round and round)
(round it go)
2pacalypse now, don't stop for hoes
I get around
(round and round)
(round it go)
Why I aint called you (hahaha please)
Fingertips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips, sank ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips
See me jockin'
Put a little twist in her hips
Cuz Im watchin'
Conversations on the phone
'Till the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn em off, time to set it off
Get you wet n soft
Somethings on your mind, let it off
You don't know me
You just met me
You wont let me
Well if I couldnt have it, (silly rabbit)
Why you sweatin' me?
Its a lot of real Gs doin' time
Cuz a groupy bit the trooper told a lie
You picked the wrong guy
Baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door
Search for a new guy
Cuz I only got one night in town
Break down or be clowned
Baby doll are you down?
I get around
