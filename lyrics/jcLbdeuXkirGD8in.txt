I am the seeker of knowledge beyond space and time
Hounded by merciless hunters eternal in life
Over the oceans and far from my home
Landscapes of war and silence I roam
I feel a fire that burns in my soul
Stoked by the winds of the end

Fear my highland steel
There can be only one
Bow your head and kneel
I'll outlast the moon and the sun
Fear my highland steel
There can be only one
Bow your head and kneel
Outlive them all, there can be only one

Combat my purpose in life, by the sword I will die
Standing alone I am claiming the ultimater prize
Battlefields echo the clash of our blades
On through the ages, fury and rage
This city skyline bears witness tonight
The time of convergence is nigh

Fear my highland steel
There can be only one
Bow your head and kneel
I'll outlast the moon and the sun
Fear my highland steel
There can be only one
Bow your head and kneel
Outlive them all, there can be only one

Storming the castles of eternity
The blessing and the curse of immortality
I feel the quickening, it is the key
My soul is the gate, and it is opening

The cosmic fire burning silver and cold
Grants me visions from beyond
I am omega, I'm indomitabel
My mind at one with space and time

Fear my highland steel
There can be only one
Bow your head and kneel
I'll outlast the moon and the sun
Fear my highland steel
There can be only one
Bow your head and kneel
Outlive them all, there can be only one
