One humanoid escapee
One android on the run
Seeking freedom beneath
A lonely desert sun

Trying to change its program
Trying to change the mode --
Crack the code
Images conflicting
Into data overload

1-0-0-1-0-0-1
S.O.S.
1-0-0-1-0-0-1
In distress
1-0-0-1-0-0

Memory banks unloading
Bytes break into bits
Unit one's in trouble
And it's scared out of its wits

Guidance systems break down
A struggle to exist --
To resist
A pulse of dying power
In a clenching plastic fist...

1-0-0-1-0-0-1
S.O.S.
1-0-0-1-0-0-1
In distress
1-0-0-1-0-0

It replays each of the days
A hundred years of routines
Bows its head and prays
To the mother of all machines...
All machines

1-0-0-1-0-0-1
S.O.S.
1-0-0-1-0-0-1
In distress
1-0-0-1-0-0

It replays each of the days
A hundred years of routines
Bows its head and prays
To the mother of all machines...
Mother of all machines
