I woke up with a love one eyes upon me
loved ones arms around me

shes my one and only
and i grew up, in the bosom of my family
Eight strong arms around me

if im the seed they grow me
and i thank those, those that give me company
they are a wall of arms around me

it is they who are my army
it is they who are my army

and through these eyes
there is no god got above me
no devil below me
no purgatory, no pearly gates
the worms are what await me
its only me that can forgive me

and i have faith, oh i have faith
and i have faith, oh i have faith
In those who put up with me

shes my one and only
if im the seed they grow me
they who are my army
the wall of arms around me

shes my one and only
if im the seed they grow me
they who are my army
the wall of arms around me
