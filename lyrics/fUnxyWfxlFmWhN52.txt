genetic engineering
could create the perfect race
(could) create an unknown life-force
that could us exterminate

introducing worker clone
as our subordinated slave
his expertise proficiency
will surely dig our grave

it's so very tempting
will biologists resist
when he becomes the creator
will he let us exist

bionic man is jumping
through the television set
he's about to materialise
and guess who's coming next
