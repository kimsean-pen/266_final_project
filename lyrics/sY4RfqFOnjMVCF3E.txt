I've had it
With distant double vision
My hand swollen
I can't keep holding on
My heart's sinking
And stuck in deadly rhythm
I can't fake it
I can't, can't brush it of

Love
Love is dangerous
Love
Love is so dangerous

I'm back at it
I just don't seem to listen
I see your lips
I just can't hear the sound
It's all static
Just like my television
Her skills sharpened
Her eyes cut through the clouds

Love
Love is dangerous
(Guys don't be fooled when she says it)
Love
Love is so dangerous
(We'll betray the ones we care about)
Love is so dangerous
(We're fools, so we all pretend to find)
Love
Love is dangerous

I need love
Love is dangerous
(Guys don't be fooled when she says it)
Love
Love is so dangerous
(We'll betray the ones we care about)
Love
Love is dangerous
(We're fools, so we all pretend to find)
Love
Love is dangerous
