I was feeling sick, losing my mind
Heard about these treatments from a good friend of mine here
He was always happy, smile on his face
He said he had a great time at the place
there

Peace and love is here to stay
And now I can wake up and face the day
I'm happy, I'm happy all the time
Shock treatment, I'm doing fine

Gimme, gimme shock treatment
Gimme, gimme shock treatment
Gimme, gimme shock treatment
I wanna, wanna shock treatment
