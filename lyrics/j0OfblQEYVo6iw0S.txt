Now what was that scar situated from afar
And what was that light integrated in your mind
And what have you done it's too early for everyone
Just wait for that sign spilling over and passed in time

Come join in the last hurrah with open sores and open jaw
Find one last flaw and keep it safe and free from harm
And what have you done it's too early for everyone
Just smile go inside come and see there is no sign

Now here we are revisiting
A time a place a whole industry well we
Promise we'll be leaving soon
We share apocalyptic views
How comforting that we see them
Who are we to promise we'll be leaving shortly

Come join in the last hurrah with open sores and open jaw
And what was that light integrated in your mind
And what have you done it's too early for everyone
Just wait for that sign spilling over and over and over and over
Over and over and over and over
Over and over and over and over
Over and over and over and over and over and over...
