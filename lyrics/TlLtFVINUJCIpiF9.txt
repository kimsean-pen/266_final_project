Oh, devil, hide amongst the reeds in water
Bodies under me when you held the rope
You let go and I fall, you have it all

Snapped together in your landscape
We are heat stains
Magnetized by the night, light as a feather
I would suffer for your landscape
In the moon haze
All that's left are bloodlines

Snapped together in your landscape
We are heat stains
Magnetized by the night, light as a feather
I would suffer for your landscape
In the moon haze
All that's left are bloodlines

Oh, devil, hide amongst the leaves in water
Bleaches over me, when you held me close
Did you die when I spoke, you had it all

Snapped together in your landscape
We are heat stains
Magnetized by the night, light as a feather
I would suffer for your landscape
In the moon haze
All that's left are bloodlines

Snapped together in your landscape
We are heat stains
Magnetized by the night, light as a feather
I would suffer for your landscape
In the moon haze
All that's left are bloodlines

[Well done, the skin is ours]??
Never floating, falling words
?? hope leads us astray

Lie now and never hope
The eye is moving over us
Feelings start, a [gauntlet stays]??

Snapped together in your landscape
We are heat stains
Magnetized by the night, light as a feather
I would suffer for your landscape
In the moon haze
All that's left are bloodlines

Snapped together in your landscape
We are heat stains
Magnetized by the night, light as a feather
I would suffer for your landscape
In the moon haze
All that's left are bloodlines
