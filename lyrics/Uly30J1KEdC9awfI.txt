How can I know what you need if you never ask?
How can I drive you crazy when I've got no gas?
How could we be together when we're so far apart?
You tell me that you love me then you go and break my heart

I'll admit that I've got problems
If you'll say that you will help me solve them, yes
I realize some days I can be sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up 'cause you're my happy hour

Just because I'm never happy when I'm sobered up
I'm only good if I can have a cup
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up 'cause you're my happy hour

Only when you go away and I can't get my fix
I'm only good if I can have a sip
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up 'cause you're my happy hour

Why should I be your woman when you've got two more?
Why should I say that I do when I know you don't?
Why should I stay here with you when you are always gone?
And why should I be open when you stay so bottled up?

I'll admit that I've got problems
If you'll say that you will help me solve them, yes
I realize some days I can be sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up 'cause you're my happy hour

Just because I'm never happy when I'm sobered up
I'm only good if I can have a cup
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up 'cause you're my happy hour

Only when you go away and I can't get my fix
I'm only good if I can have a sip
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up 'cause you're my happy hour

You were all I ever needed
You were all I ever had
You were all I ever wanted
But you are making me bad

You're my happy hour
Sometimes I'm sweet, sometimes I'm sour, yeah

Just because I'm never happy when I'm sobered up
I'm only good if I can have a cup
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up 'cause you're my happy hour

Only when you go away and I can't get my fix
I'm only good if I can have a sip
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up 'cause you're my happy hour

Just because I'm never happy when I'm sobered up
And I'm only good if I'm with you
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up 'cause you're my happy hour

Just because I'm never happy when I'm sobered up
And I'm only good if I'm with you
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up 'cause you're my happy hour
