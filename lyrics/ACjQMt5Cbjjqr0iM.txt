He can't take the street no more
Street too full, full of junk
Thinks he'll hide in his room
Room too full, full of junk

He turns on his TV, TV full, full of junk
Processed zombies pushing junk
Junk food, junk clothes
Dressed in junk from head to toe

Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given
Eat what you get

Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given

And be thankful what you get
Instead he screams for more

Hits the night life once again
Night life full, full of junk
Junk is all he'll ever know
Junk music, junk dance
Too many junk heads on the floor

Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given
Eat what you get

Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given

And be thankful what you get
Instead he screams for more

Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given
Eat what you get

Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given

And be thankful what you get
Instead he screams for more
Instead he screams for more
Instead he screams for more
