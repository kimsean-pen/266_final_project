You gonna swim to the top of the water, boys
Into the waves of the shimmering light
She's gonna drag you to the shore
But you don't know who you are
Take, take your time for now
You gonna take, take your time

Welcome to the city with too many roads
You're not gonna know where to go
Just follow all the pretty lights
Get lost till it feels right
The places you will go

It can be shiny, tiny, strange and windy
But if you're doing it right
It's gonna get a little lonely
But that's all right
The only thing you need to fear
Is shaking hands with the man in the mirror

Blah blah, blah blah blah
Big talkers are talking
But you don't wanna hear
'Cause when it gets easy
Don't be drowning in the dreamer's hands
Don't be drowning in the dreamer's hands
Get out, get out while you can

Oh, the places you will go
Get out, get out, get out, get out
Oh, the places you will go
Get out, get out, get out, get out

Oh, the places you will go
Get out, get out, get out, get out
Sometimes you don't even wanna know
Get out, get out, get out, get out

The storm, she's breaking hard tonight
Just put your head down on her shoulders
Cause you know, cause you know, you know she's gonna pass
Take your time and make this moment last
Take your time, take your time, take your time tonight
Take your time before it's over

Doesn't really matter where you are
Oh, the places you will go from here
