But to me death is not a fearful thing, it's living that's treacherous
I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and stop to see your day
You really want to hole up
You really want to stay inside and sleep the light away
I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and make it light all day
You really want to hole up
You really want to stay inside and not care where you lay
Well I know what's good
Exactly cause I have been there before

Yeah I know what's good
Exactly those things night cannot behold
I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and stop to see your day
You really want to hole up
You really want to stay inside and sleep the light away
I think it's good to go out
cause if you don't you'll never make a memory that will stay
I think that you should wake up
I think I want to live my life and you're just in my way
