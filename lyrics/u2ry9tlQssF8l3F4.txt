Rise of nation's pride!

Russians on the route to ruin
Kremlin's more than certain to win
Sent away an army to the west
Blizzard reigned the ground were chosen
Snow is deep and hell is frozen
Stalin were too eager to invade

He thought of the might he possessed
And not of his foe
Rage of winter!

Rise nation's pride!
Hold what's yours!
Strike to where it hurts!
Fight!
Hold your ground!
Winter war!
Reinforce the line!

Split them into small divisions!
Rip them of the conquest visions
Motti tactics used with great results
Snipers move unseen in snowfall
Force them to retreat and recall
Fight the russian rule and their demand

With molotov cocktail in hand
No fear of the tanks
Death for Glory!

Rise nation's pride!
Hold what's yours!
Strike to where it hurts!
Fight!
Hold your ground!
Winter war!
Reinforce the line!

A slice of a knife through a throat
And blood turns to ice
Talvisota!

Rise nation's pride!
Hold what's yours!
Strike to where it hurts!
Fight!
Hold your ground!
Winter war!
Reinforce the line!
Rise nation's pride!
Hold what's yours!
Strike to where it hurts!
Fight!
Hold your ground!
Winter war!
Reinforce the line!
