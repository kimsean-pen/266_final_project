Someone should teach you some manners
(I wish I had a camera)
I think you're got more nerve than you've got tact
(I wanna take a picture)
Of the look when your words bite you back
(Remember how I shut you out just like that)

What do you see when you close your eyes?
(Do you sleep?)
I know you do and I'm not surprised while your ego keeps you warm
(It's burning)
All the bridges that you swore
(Would never fall)

We tried, oh we tried
I earned my wings teaching guys like you to keep their mouths shut
(So keep your mouth shut)
I might have lost what I found
But I'm right back here to haunt you
And now I'm right back here

(You're so transparent)
I see right through your empty chest and spineless back
(I've seen enough not to trust)
I think enough is enough
(You got too close)

You know I'm terrible at keeping track of sleep
(It always seems to sneak away)
Along with wolves like you
Dressed as counted sheep

We tried, oh we tried
(I kept my mouth shut, I kept my mouth shut)
What goes around comes around
And now it's right back here to haunt you

We tried, oh we tried
I earned my wings teaching guys like you to keep their mouths shut
(So keep your mouth shut)
I might have lost what I found
But I'm right back here to haunt you
And now I'm right back here

It always seems to slip away
I'm taking back what is mine
What is left stays here to haunt you

It always seems to slip away
Don't even know what you lost
But I hope this will remind you
(You could never be honest)
Remind you
(You're not the first or the last I promise)

We tried, oh we tried
(I kept my mouth shut, I kept my mouth shut)
What goes around comes around
And now it's right back here to haunt you

We tried, oh we tried
I earned my wings teaching guys like you to keep their mouths shut
(So keep your mouth shut)
I might have lost what I found
But I'm right back here to haunt you
And now I'm right back here

And now I'm right back here
And now I'm right back here to haunt you
