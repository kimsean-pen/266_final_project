Can't swim so I took a boat, to an island so remote
Only Johnny Depp has ever been to it before
I stayed there till the air was clear
I was bored and out of tears
then I saw you washed up on the shore
I offered you my coat

thank god this luck can flow
Crazy how that shipwreck meant my ship was coming in
We talked till the sun went down
Love on the puget sound
My treasure map was on your skin

Beauty in the water, angel on the beach

Ocean's daughter, I thought love was out of reach
Till I got her, had I known it could come true
I would have wished in '92, for a mermaid just like you
Whoa, just like you, whoa
Sharks green with envy
they
wonder what you see in me

Funny thoughts sometimes can't help but wonder about as well
Now life is a holiday, making up for the years I paid

The weight to this heavenly bay, it went through hell

Beauty in the water, angel on the beach
Ocean's daughter, I thought love was out of reach
Till I got her, had I known it could come true

I would have wished in '92, for a mermaid just like you
Whoa, just like you, whoa
Rescued you by the banyan tree
All the girlfish in the sea
Couldn't hold a candle to you
They don't have a handle on you
They don't have a scandal on you
I love Ecco Sandals on you
Saving me was B-I-G
All the boyfish in the sea
They all wish that they could be me
Can't swim so I took a boat, to an island so remote
Only Johnny Depp has ever been to it before
Beauty in the water, angel on the beach
Ocean's daughter, I thought love was out of reach
Till I got her, had I known it could come true
I would have wished in '92, for a mermaid just like you
Whoa, just like you, whoa.
