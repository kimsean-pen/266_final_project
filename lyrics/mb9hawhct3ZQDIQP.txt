You ready?
Whoo!
Here we go!

Life is just a party so come as you are
Dress it up or dress it down, never forget your guitar
Just be courageous, cause style's contagious
Everyone can rock out like a superstar

Let's get crazy
Get up and dance
Take a swing, do your thing
If we're taking a chance

Let's get crazy
Yeah just kick up your heels
Don't miss out, time to shout
Always keeping it real
Let's get crazy
Crazy

Our songs, our style
Our hair, our smile
Our laughs, our heart
Our grace, our smarts

You see me on the cover of a magazine
Remember, things are always different then the way that it seems
Here's an invitation, to every nation
Meet me on the dance floor and we'll make the scene

Get up and dance
Take a swing, do your thing

Our hair, our smile
Our laughs, our heart
Our grace, our smarts

Let's get crazy
Get up and dance
Take a swing, do your thing
If we're taking a chance

Let's get crazy
Turn the music up loud
Now's the time to unwind
Lose yourself in the crowd
Let's get crazy

Yeah the fun's just begun
Come on dance everyone
Here's an invitation, to every nation
Oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah
Crazy
Take a swing, do your thing
If we're taking a chance
