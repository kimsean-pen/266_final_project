All my loves are hidden in pieces
All my loves are within a wild night
All my loves are hidden in pieces
All my loves are within a wild night

All my loves are hidden in pieces
All my loves are within a wild night
All my loves are hidden in pieces
All my loves are within a wild night

If they are still up high
We'll throw them to the sea
If they are still on high
We'll throw them to the sea

If they are still up high
We'll throw them to the sea
Watch the murder of the wilds
To the music of the deep
Wild night, wild night

All my loves are hidden in pieces
All my loves are within a wild night
All my loves are hidden in pieces
All my loves are within a wild night

If they are still up high
We'll throw them to the sea
If they are still on high
We'll throw them to the sea

If they are still up high
We'll throw them to the sea
Watch the murder of the wilds
To the music of the deep
Wild night, wild night
Within a wild night

Wild night, wild night
Wild night, wild night
Wild night, wild night
Wild night, wild night
Wild night, wild night
