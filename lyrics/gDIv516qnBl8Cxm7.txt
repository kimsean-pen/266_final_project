This may be the last thing that I write for long
Can you hear me smiling when I sing this song?
For you
And only you

As I leave will you be someone to say goodbye?
As I leave will you be someone to wipe your eye?
My foot is out the door, and you can't stop me now

You wanted the best, it wasn't me
Will you give it back? And I'll take the lead
When there's no more room to make it grow
I'll see you again, you'll pretend you're naive
Is this what you want?
Is this what you need?
How you end up? Let me know

As I go, remember all the simple things you know
My mind is just a crutch and I still hope
That you will miss me when I'm gone
This is the last song

The hearts start breaking as the year is gone
The dream's beginning and the time rolls on
It seems so surreal, now I sing it

Somehow I knew that it would be this way
Somehow I knew that it would slowly fade
Now I am gone, just try and stop me now

You wanted the best, but it wasn't me
Will you give it back? Now I'll take the lead
When there's no more room to make it grow
I'll see you again, you'll pretend you're naive
Is this what you want?
Is this what you need?
How you end up? Let me know

As I go, remember all the simple things you know
My mind is just a crutch and I still hope
That you will miss me when I'm gone
This is the last song

Will you need me now?
You'll find a way somehow
You want it too
I want it too

As I go, remember all the simple things you know
My mind is just a crutch and I still hope
That you will miss me when I'm gone
The last song

As I go, remember all the simple things you know (things you know)
My mind is just a crutch and I still hope
That you will miss me when I'm gone
This is the last song
