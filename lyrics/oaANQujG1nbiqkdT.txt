And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
This I know...
Yeah this I know...

She told me, don't worry about it
She told me don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
People always told me be careful cause...
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo

Can't stop the feeling (I can't feel my
face when I'm with you) Dance dance dance
Can't stop the feeling (I can't feel my
face when I'm with you) Dance dance dance
Can't stop the feeling (I can't feel my
face when I'm with you) Dance dance dance
I can't feel my face when I'm with you

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Can't stop the feeling (I can't feel my
face when I'm with you) Dance dance dance
Can't stop the feeling (I can't feel my
face when I'm with you) Dance dance dance
Can't stop the feeling (I can't feel my
face when I'm with you) Dance dance dance
I can't feel my face when I'm with you

(start of descending Billie Jean bass)

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I like it, but I like it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I like it, but I like it, oh

Can't stop the feeling (I can't feel my
face when I'm with you) Dance dance dance
Can't stop the feeling (I can't feel my
face when I'm with you) Dance dance dance
Can't stop the feeling (I can't feel my
face when I'm with you) Dance dance dance
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
