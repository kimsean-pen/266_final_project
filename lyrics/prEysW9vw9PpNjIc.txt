Preyed upon the innocent
By your wicked faith
Awaiting final judgement
Sentenced by and once betrayed

Sheltered by false witness
That hides you from no more
Deep within the shadows bleed
From the depths of horror

Hidden, sheltered, disguised
Risen from the
Damned, silenced, betrayed
Preachers of the
Lies, deceit, dismay
Names are many
Serpent, thief, your faith

Stains on your hands
Anointed in blood
Stains on your hands anointed in blood
Crucification your revelation
Father of failure entangled in lies

None left to protect you
The clergy's been dispersed
I am here to guide you
And free you from this earth
The crime has been committed
Confined to punishment
Abandoned by your absent god
A finish to the end

The hallowed gates are open
Enter the abyss
Lie beside the serpent
Feel the cold and darkness as you die
A second death
Eternal lies
Reverence, nothing left

Hidden, sheltered, disguised
Risen from the
Damned, silenced, betrayed
Preachers of the
Lies, deceit, dismay
Names are many
Serpent, thief, your faith

Stains on your hands
Anointed in blood
Stains on your hands anointed in blood
Crucification your revelation
Father of failure entangled in lies

Hypocrites, believers
Brandishing his lies
Holy ghost rejected
With vengeance end your life
