Sprinting off the dock
Shallow water mud
Ripple water shine
Second day of our stay
It was, and it's been a long time
It was, but now it's not mine

I took the boat out on the lake
And I was okay
Need to get that feeling back
Once in a lifetime
Ripple water shine
The wind and the paddle drip
And the moving on life
It was, and it's been a long time
It was, but now it's not mine

And life moving on
Setting my heart
The sun's steady pressure saw the ticking stop
But I was all smiles
And I'm still waiting for that drink at Otto's
And I'm still always slowly waiting for what follows
For what I've learned about being so defined by someone dying
And for thinking before I speak
And hoping for something bigger
But it's a size I can't teach
For how things were
Or how they should be
Like a bolt from the blue
You left me that belief
Oh, you left me that belief

Ripple water shine
It's been a long time
And it's alright
Ripple water shine
Now it's not mine
And it's alright
It's alright
