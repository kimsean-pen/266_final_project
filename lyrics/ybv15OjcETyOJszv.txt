Won't be so easy,
This time to hurt me,
You can try,
And this time Oh Baby,
There are no tears left here to dry,
If you think you can wound me like before
If you think you can do that anymore,
Won't get to far,
NO!
You Can't Break A Broken Heart,
So try your best now baby,
Try your best to break me,
You can't break a broken heart,
No damage you can do now,
I'm immune to you now,
You can't break what broke apart,
There's nothing you can do to me no more,
You can't break a broken heart.

Hurt me before now,
Won't hurt no more now,
Not this time,
You might do better,
Messing with someone else's mind,
Cause You're not gonna bring me down again,
You're done with throwing me the way you did,
It's gone to far oh,
You Can't Break A Broken Heart,
So try your best now baby,
Try your best to break me,
You can't break a broken heart,
No damage you can do now,
I'm immune to you now,
You can't break what broke apart,
There's nothing you can do to me no more,
You can't break a broken heart.

So don't waste your time,
Your time has come and gone,
What are you here for,
You can't hurt me anymore,
So try your best now baby,
Try your best to break me,
You can't break the broken heart,
No damage you can do now,
I'm immune to you now,
You can't break what broke apart,
There's nothing you can do to me no more,
You can't break a broken heart.

So try your best now baby,
Try your best to break me,
You can't break a broken heart,
No damage you can do now,
I'm immune to you now,
You can't break what broke apart,
There's nothing you can do to me no more,
You can't break a broken heart.

Break a broken heart.
