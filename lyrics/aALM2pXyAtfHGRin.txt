Father ocean hear my song
You're the wave I was made from
Take me back to where we once begin
Tell my love why I went rough
Years I've tried to be someone
Could it be your darkness holds the key?
And we close our eyes we may begin to see

Father ocean hear my song
You're the wave I was made from
Take me back to where we once begin
Ocean father I was wrong
Years I followed just the sun
Now I see your darkness holds the key
I close my eyes and I begin to see

When were alone
When were alone
When were alone
When were alone

When were alone
When were alone
