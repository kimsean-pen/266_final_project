Summer sun is leavin'
Sunny day's been dreamin'
Winter coats on everyone
Winter smiles feel so warm
I'll stand the odd space
Party at Sunday
I fell in love but never again
I fell in love and I hated it
All my friends will get bored
And all my friends are assholes
Every trip is around one now
Every eye is green or brown
All the girls are trashed up
And all the boys are way up
I fell in love but never again
I fell in love and I hated it
