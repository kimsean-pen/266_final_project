You are so worthy of everything
I have to give
But I burn with feeble offerings
Nothing to sustain
Fan against the flame
Oh what I've made

So take all of me
Please take all of me

It's like I'm running away from me
It's like I've taken the puzzle in me
And left it scrambled for all to see

It's like I'm fighting behind these walls
And hiding through metaphors
This is real, these are flaws

So take all of me
Please take all of me
