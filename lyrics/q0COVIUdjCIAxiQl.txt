Yeah
Oh, yeah
A-come on, girl
Hey

She move so quick, she move so fast
She move so quick she make the good times last
She said that even in the mornin' said you know it's on
Even in the mornin'

Free love (Free love)
Free love (Free love, love, love) Love

She like it rough, she bendin' bones
She starts a screamin' when she's ready to go
She said that even in the mornin' said you know that it's on
Even in the mornin'

Free love (Free love)
Free love (Free love, love, love) Love

Pretty girl come with me
Two on two, three on three
Passion is the flavor climbin' up this tree
Make a fuss, move around
Keep it on the underground
Just beneath the covers I can see the sea

She knocking knees, so full of pride
She made the move 'cause she's got nothin' to hide
She said that even in the mornin' said you know that it's on
Even in the mornin'

Free love (Free love)
Free love (Free love, love, love) Love

[Bridge]

Free love (Free love)
Free love (Free love)
Free love (Free love)
Free love, love, love, love, love, love, love-love, love
