Here is my advice to you
Think about all that you do
If you don't like what you see
You only have to tell me

But I don't know what to do
Why should I listen to you?
If you could see what I see
You wouldn't listen to me

Are you really so hard?
Are you really so hard in your heart?
Are you really so hard?
Are you really so hard in your heart?

But I don't know what to do
Why should I listen to you?
If you could see what I see
You wouldn't listen to me

Are you really so hard?
Are you really so hard in your heart?
Are you really so hard?
Are you really so hard in your heart?

And when the sunshine's down
It shines upon our town
And everybody says
I want to, I want to

But when the angels come round
They'll stamp us into the ground
So how can I say
I want to grow some wings to fly away
(I want to run away, hey!)

Are you really so hard?
Are you really so hard in your heart?
Are you really so hard?
Are you really so hard in your heart?
