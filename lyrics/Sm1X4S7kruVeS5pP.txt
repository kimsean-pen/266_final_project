David Correy - 24/7

247 and ooh, she like me
365, wanna be my wifey
all up on my snap, i know she crazy
lowkey, lowkey, that's my baby
247, i know she, know she
i know she, know she like me

just touched down in your town, baby
is you 'bout that life or gonna play me baby?
use your chance, come see if i'm with it
when i'm outta town, come persuade me to hit it
why you acting shy like you don't wanna see me?
all up on my snap screaming that you really need me
she crazy, psycho, demanded
but i can't lie, still love when i'm in it
tryna get a snapchat pic when we finished
to show proof that a ngg hit it
but baby girl, you know we ain't finished

247, i know she, know she
247 and ooh, she like me
365, wanna be my wifey
all up on my snap, i know she crazy
lowkey, lowkey, that's my baby
247, i know she, know she
i know she, know she like me

she crazy, yes, maybe
but lowkey, lowkey, that's my baby
either she jealous or just over-zealous
checking my snap as we check like propellers
she tweet, snap, and all in her feelings
no love but, she is my mistress

247, i know she, know she
247 and ooh, she like me
365, wanna be my wifey
all up on my snap, i know she crazy
lowkey, lowkey, that's my baby
247, i know she, know she
i know she, know she like me
