They keep telling me to love myself
How the fuck do you love yourself
When you don't even know
Who the fuck you are anymore?
Like you feel like you're reaching your breaking point
Every fucking day and it's just
It's hard, man

They don't wanna talk
They don't wanna feel
The voices in my head saying
I don't think I'm real
They don't wanna talk
They don't wanna feel
The voices in my head saying
I don't think I'm
They don't wanna talk
They don't wanna feel
The voices in my head saying
I don't think I'm real
I don't think I'm real
I don't think I'm real
I don't think I'm real
I don't think I'm

I don't know where my heads been at
And I've been feeling like a nuisance just because of that
It's like a headache but the funny thing about it's that
The pain won't go away till my brain go splat
And I've been trying to decode myself, figure my shit out
Get a better grip and spark the spliff that's in my mouth
I can't cope without the dope and time's just runnin' out
Losin' my patience, I'm vacant, a hollow body now
I'm finding other ways to try to cope with all the pain
And if I'm being honest with you, baby I am not okay
The fucking voice inside my head is driving me insane
And silence kills me, lately it just hasn't been the same

Lost in my head, lost in my mind
Telling myself that I'll be just fine
Nothing's okay, nothing's alright
Smoking all day, crying all night
And what the fuck you expect from the kid
I got demons in my orbit that I'm tryin' to rid
Of all the shit that I deal with, I act on a whim
I'm like a fish outta water trying to swim
Bedroom dweller, I'm feelin' so fucking stellar
When I empty my clip into the chest of the teller
Killed the man inside of me that's been lane switchin' better
Grab the 9, grip the trigger, this my suicide letter

They don't wanna talk
They don't wanna feel
The voices in my head saying
I don't think I'm real
They don't wanna talk
They don't wanna feel
The voices in my head saying
I don't think I'm
They don't wanna talk
They don't wanna feel
The voices in my head saying
I don't think I'm real
I don't think I'm real
I don't think I'm real
I don't think I'm real
I don't think I'm
