(I've been workin' so hard, baby
Tryin' to get to you
I'm gonna be there soon, because-)

In the heat of the day, many miles away
When the sun is beating down upon the Main Street
I'll be waitin' here at the station
I gotta move down the line
They'll be dancin' and singin' and doin' their thing
And they'll be rockin' and rollin' until the day is done
You know, I've got to make the deadline

I gotta get that southbound train tonight
If I don't get to the border, then I'll write

The Mardi Gras will be blowin' strong
And the people dancin' all across the city
I'm leaving here tonight
I gotta move down the line
I'm gonna catch a ride on the 9:05
I'm gonna ride the rails until we reach the mornin'
Maybe three or four hundred miles

I gotta get that southbound train tonight
If I don't get to the border, then I'll write

When the wind is blowing softly
Through the streets of a little town and the music's playin'
You're waitin' somewhere over the horizon

I gotta get that southbound train tonight
If I don't get to the border, then I'll write

You know I'm coming, baby
You know I'm coming, baby
