And if forever never comes, then I
And if forever never comes, then I
And if forever never comes, then I
I'll hold on, and hold on...

I keep listening to my chest
For a beat, but there's nothing left
It's been a week since I've seen you
And I still can't believe it
'Cause I'm dying inside alone

And every day we gotta be apart
I'm like a baby with a broken heart
But the second that I see you
You will know how much I need you
'Cause I never be lettin' you go

I'm lost without you
And there's nothing I can do
You're the one I can't go without
But by holding onto you
Then I'll be holding on forever

I've got you now but
Not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
'Cause every moment I'm with you
It's like I'm holding onto Heaven

And if forever never comes, then I
And if forever never comes, then I
And if forever never comes, then I
I'll hold on, and hold on...

And if I can write a symphony
Baby you would be my melody
And you would flow like a river
Slowly going on forever
Like a feather that's blowin' away

Like every woman needs a fairy tale
Like every mother's love that never fails
Like every game that needs a player
Every sinner needs a savior
I've a feeling you're with the saints

I'm lost without you

And there's nothing I can do
You're the one I can't go without
But by holding onto you
Then I'll be holding on forever

I've got you now but
Not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
'Cause every moment I'm with you
It's like I'm holding onto Heaven

And I'm willing to wait
Just to see you another day
What I'm waiting for
Wash.this... pain.away
And it's never too late

And if forever never comes, then I
And if forever never comes, then I
And if forever never comes, then I
I'll hold on, and hold on...

I'm lost without you
And there's nothing I can do
You're the one I can't go without
But by holding onto you
Then I'll be holding on forever

I got you now but
Not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
'Cause every moment I'm with you
It's like I'm holding onto Heaven

And if forever never comes, then I
And if forever never comes, then I
And if forever never comes, then I

'Cause every moment I'm with you
It's like I'm holding onto Heaven

And if forever never comes, then I
And if forever never comes, then I
And if forever never comes, then I

'Cause every moment I'm with you
It's like I'm holding onto Heaven
