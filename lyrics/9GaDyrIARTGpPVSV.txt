Though nothing's changed on my end
Yet you think I'll just give in
I know the game, I've been there
Come back and claim that you care
You say it's always been you
We both know that's far from the truth
I know it's cold and lonely
But I'm not your one and only

I won't be the one you call when everyone is gone
And when you treat her wrong don't wish that she was me
Now that I moved along it's clear we don't belong
This is your last song, don't wish that she was me

I always wished you well
I always tried to let you down slowly
I cared enough but you just kept going
I, I always gave you time
I did everything right but it just wasn't enough
No, you just kept on pushing

I won't be the one you call when everyone is gone
And when you treat her wrong don't wish that she was me
Now that I moved along it's clear we don't belong
This is your last song, don't wish that she

Would fall apart or break your heart
Make it easier to tear her world apart
'Cause I've started to come accustomed to
Reminding you the way I weigh past through
I don't wanna do this honestly, do you?
I didn't know what love was then
So how can you say that nothing has changed?
And you still regret letting go of me that day

You didn't know what love
What love was then
So this is your last song

I won't be the one you call when everyone is gone
And when you treat her wrong just don't go wishing she was me
Now that I moved along it's clear we don't belong
This is your last song, don't wish that she was me

Don't wish that she was me
Don't wish that she was me
(I won't be the one you call)
Don't wish that she was me
(And when you treat her wrong)
Don't wish that she was me
