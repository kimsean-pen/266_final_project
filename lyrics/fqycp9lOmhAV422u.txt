Yeah-eahhh, hmmmm
yeaaahhh

I'm not your every day, around the way
Don't go bar-hoppin', chillin' on the block
On a cell phone frontin',
Never that, cuz I'm not that kinda girl
I need to know how you roll
And how you get down-no drama.
...money in the bank
Take me home and meet your mama
Can you handle that?
Cuz I'm that kinda girl
I'm that kinda girl

Boy you aint impressin' me
With your jewelry, your designer clothes
Or the games that you try to play
Think you need to know, I got my own
Dont need you for your dough
Hearin' me, maybe then we can flow, let me know
Make me smile, maybe we can chill
Keep it real, show me something I can feel
Cause I'm not your average ordinary type
Could you be that kinda guy I like?

I'm not your every day, around the way
Don't go bar-hoppin', chillin' on the block
On a cell phone frontin',
Never that, cuz I'm not that kinda girl
I need to know how you roll
And how you get down-no drama.
...money in the bank
Take me home and meet your mama
Can you handle that?
Cuz I'm that kinda girl
I'm that kinda girl

Everytime I be up at the spot, chilling with my crew
We'll be hanging out, get in a little late
You start bugging out
I dont think it's fair
You don't like the clothes I wear
How I do my hair
I don't really care
But it's not for you
And I aint got nothin' to prove
There cant be any us, if there can't be any trust
Nothin' to discuss, no doubt
I'm not that kinda girl to let you play me out

I'm not your every day, around the way
Don't go bar-hoppin', chillin' on the block
On a cell phone frontin',
Never that, cuz I'm not that kinda girl
I need to know how you roll
And how you get down-no drama.
...money in the bank
Take me home and meet your mama
Can you handle that?
Cuz I'm that kinda girl
I'm that kinda girl

You might take me shopping, but I'm not your property
If I dont like it, I i decide it that
I can make it on my own
As long as we disagree to agree
Down for you and you're down for me
Baby I'll put you on
and we can build a love so strong

I'm not your every day, around the way
Don't go bar-hoppin', chillin' on the block
On a cell phone frontin',
Never that, cuz I'm not that kinda girl
I need to know how you roll
And how you get down-no drama.
...money in the bank
Take me home and meet your mama
Can you handle that?
Cuz I'm that kinda girl
I'm that kinda girl

Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
Not That Kinda Girl
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
Not That Kinda Girl
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
You even know what kinda girl I am?
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
I'm that kinda girl
ooohoohh-yeaaahh
