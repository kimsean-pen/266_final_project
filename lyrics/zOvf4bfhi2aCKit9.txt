Submerged in dirt but it was never enough
To quell the fire in the back of my lungs
My bones are aching and my head is a mess
They said to run but I'm obsessed with the madness

This blood I bleed, I bleed for you
I paint the walls with my misery
This blood I bleed, I bleed for me
I can't live if I can't breathe

The part I can't control
I can't destroy the wretchedness inside
The wretchedness inside of you (inside)
The wretchedness inside of me

Consigned to hurt but it was never enough
To bury feelings that will surely return
My heart is aching, and my god, I'm a mess
I'll never run 'cause I'm obsessed with the madness

This blood I bleed, I bleed for you
I paint the walls with my misery
This blood I bleed, I bleed for me
I cannot live if I can't breathe

The part I can't control
I can't destroy the wretchedness inside
The wretchedness inside of you (inside)
The wretchedness inside of me
I cannot control, I cannot destroy, in hell can I confide?
The wretchedness inside of you (in hell can I confide?)
The wretchedness inside of me

How did it come to this?
How the fuck did it come to this?
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance
How did it come to this?
How the fuck did it come to this?
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance, fuck you!

How did it come to this?
How the fuck did it come to this?
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance

How did it come to this?
How the fuck did it come to this?
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance

This blood I bleed, I bleed for you
I paint the walls with my misery
This blood I bleed, I bleed for me
I cannot live if I can't breathe

The part I can't control
I can't destroy the wretchedness inside
The wretchedness inside of you (inside)
The wretchedness inside of me
I cannot control, I cannot destroy, in hell can I confide?
The wretchedness inside of you (in hell can I confide?)
The wretchedness inside of me
