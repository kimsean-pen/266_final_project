Rose girls in glass vases
Perfect bodies, perfect faces
They all belong in magazines
Those girls the boys are chasing
Winning all the games they're playing
They're always in a different league

Stretching toward the sky like I don't care
Wishing you could see me standing there

But I'm a sunflower, a little funny
If I was a rose, maybe you'd want me
If I could, I'd change overnight
And turn into something you'd like
But I'm a sunflower, a little funny
If I was a rose, maybe you'd pick me
But I know you don't have a clue
This sunflower's waiting for you
Waiting for you

No thorns in this dimension
Hiding this feel of rejection
This high I've never felt so small
Not used to this attention
Permanently in suspension
I wish I didn't care at all

Stretching toward the sky like I don't care
Wishing you could see me standing there

But I'm a sunflower, a little funny
If I was a rose, maybe you'd want me
If I could, I'd change overnight
And turn into something you'd like
But I'm a sunflower, a little funny
If I was a rose, maybe you'd pick me
But I know you don't have a clue
This sunflower's waiting for you
Waiting for you

I'm a sunflower, a little funny
If I was a rose, maybe you'd pick me
But I know you don't have a clue
This sunflower's waiting for you
Waiting for you
