Cigarette burns forever
The message is spliced together
Now I would never let her
But where did people go to get her
You took me to the private party
And swore that they would not cart me
Drive careful less they hear ye
When all the time they learnt to fear you.

The sidewinder drinks and gambles
The gold digger strikes his damsels
But when I lost the magic sandals
I said some things I could not handle.

Going 90 off my star
So is flashing by as the flame retards
Don't you wanna be some other
And all the people have to drug each other.
I fell into a life of leisure
I saw to a path of pleasure
Don't it make it that much better
To find a cigarette burns forever.
