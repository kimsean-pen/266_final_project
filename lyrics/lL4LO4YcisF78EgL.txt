Arise thy evil soul
Mortals end is near
Rise of the ancients are coming
Mortals dwell in fear
Ripped up from the grave
The gathering is here

Kingdom of the dark
That has made our souls so strong
It's floating in our blood
The words of unholiness

Arise thy evil soul
Mortals end is near
Rise of the ancients are coming
Mortals dwell in fear
Dead walks from their graves
The gathering is here

Never will die

All within the abyss

Incense fills the cave
Where the Sabbath is held
You can feel the lust in the air
The smell of death

We all know what's to come
The warlock - Satan's son
Day of doom, suffocation
The time has come to darkend the sun
