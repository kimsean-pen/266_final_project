Too soon, wanted more time
Could've held out, but your clock was ticking
No easing in, straightened out lines
Alone with your thoughts
'Cause your friends are still in

Night clubs and back rooms
Baggies in the bathrooms
Nothing's changed but you
Saying nothing's missing
Thoughts are drifting away from you

Morning sun fills the void
Now you see there never was a point

Over and over and over again
'Till you can no longer pretend you are sane
Try but you couldn't get any more sure
And the ending still will never change

Over and over and over again
'Till you can no longer pretend you are sane
Try but you couldn't get any more sure
And the ending still will never change

Tomorrow night'll go on without you
Go on without you there
Tomorrow night'll go on without you
'Till dawn and no one will care

You can't know, it's a move in the dark
Hesitation leaves you hung on the lip
Unclench your teeth
Peel off the smile
See no one there, and you release your grip

Night clubs and back rooms
Baggies in the bathrooms
Nothing's changed but you
Saying nothing's missing
Thoughts are drifting away from you

Led the beast to the cliff
One more step and a long way down
The morning sun fills the void
Now you see there never was a point

Over and over and over again
'Till you can no longer pretend you are sane
Try but you couldn't get any more sure
And the ending still will never change

Over and over and over again
'Till you can no longer pretend you are sane
Try but you couldn't get any more sure
And the ending still will never change
