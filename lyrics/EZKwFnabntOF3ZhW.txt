I don't mind if you want to sleep on your own
I don't mind if you want to bring somebody home
to spend the night
I don't mind your casual affairs
your one-night stands because I know I'm the main man in your life
And you know I don't mind if you leave me behind
When you go away for a couple of days
but you know that I could come too
and I wouldn't intrude, wouldn't make any fuss
'cos things are so cool between us
Your affection is ultimately mine

remember from the start
I won't take up all of your time
I am in your heart
Your body
But you must admit
I'm prepared to share
at off-peak times
when you think about it
because we know
that others have
and do share mine
that you're mine
