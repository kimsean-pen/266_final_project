It is about time to face it
Surrender and then start again
I don't know if I could make it
But there has got to come an end

If I stay in this place
Every hour is another day
Let the walls come falling down
And then the fear washes away

Running forever
Longing for your love so cool
For something better
I'll never stop following you

So may the road rise up to meet me
May the wind be at my back
All of this will soon be over
I don't think I'll be coming back

Though I fear what is to come
I must soldier on and try to see
At the end of the road
Someone holds out for me

Running forever
Longing for your love so cool
To someone better
I'll never stop following you
