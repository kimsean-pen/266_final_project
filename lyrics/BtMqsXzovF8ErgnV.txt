Okay, so I call about a thousand times
I wait outside and I join the line
With a million girls that are just like me, ooh

I got your name saved on my screen
It says how much that you love me
And I know that it's not a dream

Oh, yeah

It's like I keep on giving with nothing in return
Just a constant burning, I'll never learn
So let me just fairytale that we are in love
I'd rather live a life this way, oh, yeah
It's my life anyway

I close my eyes and you kiss me
You say how much that you miss me
And no one compares to what we've got

Then I wake up and it's just a dream
Somehow I wish it was reality
Trying to deal with the fact it's not

Oh, yeah

It's like I keep on giving with nothing in return
Just a constant burning, I'll never learn
So let me just fairytale that we are in love
I'd rather live a life this way, oh, yeah
It's my life anyway

And I ain't ever gonna learn 'cause
I ain't ever gonna learn cause

I keep on giving with nothing in return
Just a constant burning, I'll never learn
So let me just fairytale that we are in love
I'd rather live a life this way

It's like I keep on giving with nothing in return
Just a constant burning, I'll never learn
So let me just fairytale that we are in love
I'd rather live a life this way, oh, yeah
It's my life anyway
