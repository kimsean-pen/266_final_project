Still depressed, still misunderstood
Still popping pills, popping seals, smoking Backwoods
Still smoke a Swisher if you got it with you
Everybody want me sober, but I'm not a quitter
I say the less you know, the better, that west bank fire setter
$uicide dream team, it's that codeine fiend
Hell bound is what I'm deemed, surrounded by crime scenes
Only peace that I know is sleep or be deceased, shit
I can't call it anymore
Get more depressed when I'm on tour
Wake up in the middle of a war
Wake up wishing that I was a fucking corpse, fuck

Yeah, now if we got a problem then we got a problem
I don't give a fuck, I can't even see that far at the bottom
My cousin toxic and I'm rotten, this ain't an option
I was opting out responsibility, turn a new leave and get it popping
Pull up on their fucking ass, all they do is fucking ask
"Can I flash you with the gas?"
And so I pull up on their ass then I ask
"Want to catch the gat's blast?" It's always back to back
($uicide, $uicide, $uiciiiide)
Used to calm my depression, used to call it my progression
Used to make me less upset and ($uicide, $uicide, $uiciiiide)
Now causes all my depression
