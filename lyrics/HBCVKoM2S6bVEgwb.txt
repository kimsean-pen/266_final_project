The Letter
...
Give me a ticket for an aeroplane
I ain't got time to take no fast train
Oh lonely days are gone, I'm coming home
Well my baby she wrote me a letter
I don't care how much I've gotta spend
I'm gonna find my way, my way back home again
Oh lonely days are gone, I'm coming home
Well my baby, she wrote me a letter
Well she wrote me a letter
Said that she can't live without me no more
Listen to me Mister
Can't you see I'm ready
For my baby once more
Anyway Yeah
I don't care how much I've gotta spend
I'm gonna find my way, gonna find my way back home again
Oh lonely days are gone, I'm a coming home
Well my baby, she wrote me a letter
