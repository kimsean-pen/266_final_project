Gotta like my dog
Rock and roll
For us to get along
You gotta know
No days off
Away from my guitar
I don't have a lot of money
Or a fancy car

But I could give you all that I got
If you can give me all that you got
Give the sun your name
If you can take away the pain

Come on and take away the pain

A rolling stone
I think it's time to go
You gotta know
I'm coming back to you
So whatcha wanna do
If iI ever get some money
I'm gonna put you on a plane

Fly you straight across the ocean
Bring you to LA
Give the sun your name
Because you take away the pain

Come on and take away the pain
Take away the pain
Will you take away the pain
Can you take away the pain
Take away the pain
