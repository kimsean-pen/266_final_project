The ones who seek justice,
Will pray for it all their lives...
They can and they will skin us all one day...
Oh can you hear them cries? (Can you hear them cries?)
As far as the man can run from us we're following the trail of blood
So hunt my young ones

I have always known the storm would come...
Listen now, my young ones
This not a story I tell
Of midnight, moon and sun...

Are you ready to walk the forbidden road
Learn again what we tried to forget
The dark can now take over you

We have a common past, an ancient bond
The people once broke
We would only take what we need,
They would harvest our weak,

But they hunted us all,
We ended the last of them, thus far, ten lifetimes ago
In hopes of healing the sore,
But the war still went on

Preying for the moon,
Hiding for the day
These might be our last times
I ain't gonna see you taken away...

Heading for the dawn
Of our way of life
You're welcome to give it your best try...
Look me in the eyes, oh, wolver
This ain't your fairy tale...

It took us many years to teach them
How to cry wolf
We made the people serve the purpose
Those ignorant fools... my young ones!

Teach the ones below you something you've learned
And learn from the ones above you
Fear is your deepest wisdom
For these last days...

Preying for the moon,
Hiding for the day
These might be our last times
I ain't gonna see you taken away...

Heading for the dawn
Of our way of life
You're welcome to give it your best try...
Look me in the eyes, oh, wolver
This ain't your fairy tale...

The ones who seek justice,
Will pray for it all their lives...
They can and they will skin us all one day...
Oh can you hear them cries? (Can you hear them cries?)
As far as the man can run from us we're following the trail of blood
So hunt my young ones,
The pack they have always feared is back

On your last day, remember, we never die
Death does not exist for us

They don't fear the wolf, but the wild within
No glory to the way this must end
This is a story I told
Unfolding before you

Preying for the moon,
Hiding for the day
These might be our last times
I ain't gonna see you taken away...

Heading for the dawn
Of our way of life
You're welcome to give it your best try...
Look me in the eyes, oh, wolver
This ain't your fairy tale...

The ones who seek justice,
Will pray for it all their lives...
They can and they will skin us all one day...
Oh can you hear them cries? (Can you hear them cries?)
As far as the man can run from us we're following the trail of blood
So hunt my young ones,
The pack they have always feared is back
