We sit side by side
I wanna know what you feel like
Tell me what you feel like
You haven't left my mind
Trust me that I've tried and I've tried, I've tried

At the hotel I met you for a drink
And after two or three you were all over me, all over me
Oh, and I know red's your favourite colour
And we sat in the same place doing impressions of each other

Oh no, baby are we gonna make it this time?
I always take hearts that shouldn't be mine, be mine
Slow down baby, are we gonna make it alive?
You've got a face that I always recognise
Always recognise

And you laughed at my crooked teeth
But you said that they suited me
And you pay attention to everything
And I know what your friends would say
Oh, it doesn't matter they're all in love with me anyway

Oh no, baby are we gonna make it this time?
I always take hearts that shouldn't be mine, be mine
Slow down baby, are we gonna make it alive?
You've got a face that I always recognise
Always recognise

Oh, and I know red's your favourite colour
Oh, and I know red's your favourite colour
I just wanna know

Oh no, baby are we gonna make it this time?
I always take hearts that shouldn't be mine, be mine
Slow down baby, are we gonna make it alive?
You've got a face that I always recognise
Always recognise

Oh, and I know red's your favourite colour
Oh, and I know red's your favourite colour
Your favourite colour
