Sun, sun, sun, sun, sun...

I can see the sun coming up
and I need it (oooh yeah)
I feel like I've been down for a while
I can feel the world spin around
do you feel it (oooh yeah)
before everyday comes the night

I can see the sun coming up
and I need it (oooh yeah)

I can feel the world spin around
do you feel it (oooh yeah)
before everyday comes the night

Sun, sun, sun, sun, sun...

I can see the sun coming up
and I need it (oooh yeah)
I feel like I've been down for a while
I can feel the world spin around
do you feel it (oooh yeah)
