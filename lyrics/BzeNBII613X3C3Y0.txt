I'll stir it up
With a tiny spoon
You want me to say
"You want some more?"
It may be poisonous for you
I'll stir it up
With a silver spoon
You want me to say
"You want some more?"
Well, it may be poisonous for you
Dropping down
Dropping down, ah...
My tears
Like syrup
"You want some more?"
Look, it's dissolving
You know may be poisonous for you
Your tea will
Be weakened
And get cold
