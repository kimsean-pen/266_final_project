Ride!
To the farway mountains
Fight!
Many goblins and trolls
Quest!
For the hammer of glory

The snow keeps on falling
As I ride to the north
I set out on a journey so far
Have been on my way thenceforth
My armour and my weapons
Now covered with ice
Many battle have they seen
But onwards I must strive

To defeat the foes of Dundee
I must have a weapon of ultimate steel

Ride!
To the farway mountains
Fight!
Many goblins and trolls
Quest!
For the hammer of glory
To wield the power to slay all your foes

My mission is simple
My purpose is clear
In a cave on a mountain up high
There lies a mystical shrine
If a warrior quests there
With a heart pure of steel
The gods will grant unto him
A weapon that shall be revealed

The Hammer of Glory it's called
Passed down by heroes from centuries old

Ride!
To the farway mountains
Fight!
Many goblins and trolls
Quest!
For the hammer of glory
To wield the power to slay all your foes

The shrine lies before me now
The hammer in sight
I raise it up to the heavens above
And I -
HAIL THE KING!!!
