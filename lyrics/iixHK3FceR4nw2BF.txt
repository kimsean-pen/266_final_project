I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in, oooh

I know it in my body
I need rest from muscle ache
I really need a break
So I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in, oooh

I know it in my body
I need to locate the switch
Hidden in me which
Will turn me off, off
Off, oooh

I know it in my body
I need it, I need it
I need it, I need it

I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in, ooh
I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in, oooh

I know it in my body
I got sleepy up at time
Praying as dark as night
I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in, uh

I need it, I need it
I need it, I need it
I need it, I need it
I need it...
