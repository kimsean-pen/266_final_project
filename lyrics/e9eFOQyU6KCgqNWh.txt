All the lights go down as I crawl into the spaces
If I died on the screens
Life tearing at the seams

I don't ever wanna be here
Like punching in a dream, breathing life into my nightmare

If it falls apart, I would surely wake it
Bright lights turn me clean
This is worse than it seems

I don't ever wanna be here
Like punching in a dream, breathing life into my nightmare

They'll get through
They'll get you
In the place that you feel it the most
When you're cornered
When it's forming
In the place that you wish was a ghost

I don't ever wanna be here
Like punching in a dream, breathing life into my nightmare

I don't ever wanna be here
Like punching in a dream, breathing life into my nightmare
