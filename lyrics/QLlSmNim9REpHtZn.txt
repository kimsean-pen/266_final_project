I don't have to be true,
'Cause you don't belong to me baby,
But all I'm saying is that,
We've got loving to do,
I'm hanging on to you,
And all I can think about is taboo

We've got sweet easy pain running through my veins,
It's like I've never been touch before,
And now addiction rise like a flash of light,
You've got coming around for more,
So lay me down,
Wrap yourself around,
Don't be a stranger when you're here,
Before we overload and the rush explodes,
I wanna hold you and wisper in your ear

I don't have to be true,
'Cause you don't belong to me baby,
But all I'm saying is that,
We've got loving to do,
I'm hanging on to you,
And all I can think about is taboo

But all I'm saying is
And all I can think of is taboo

You can cheat and lie but don't leave me dry,
Just give a little before you go,
A single taste will do, just a sip of you,
To keep me riding high on the flow,
Don't string me out, make me scream and shout,
Don't leave me shaking in the cold,
Come spend a moment with me, baby, set me free,
I wanna whisper, your love is purest gold

I don't have to be true,
'Cause you don't belong to me baby,
But all I'm saying is that,
We've got loving to do,
I'm hanging on to you,
And all I can think of is taboo

But all I'm saying is that
And all I can think of is taboo

So lay me down, wrap yourself around,
Don't be a stranger when you're here,
Before we overload and the rush explodes,
I wanna hold you and whisper in your ear

I don't have to be true,
'Cause you don't belong to me baby,
But all I'm saying is that,
We've got loving to do,
I'm hanging on to you,
And all I can think of is taboo

I don't have to be true,
'Cause you don't belong to me baby,
But all I'm saying is that,
We've got loving to do (loving),
I'm hanging on to you,
And all I can think of is taboo,
Taboo

But all I'm saying is that
And all I can think of is taboo
