Woke up some day feeling good
Though I'd try to maybe stay high forever
And drift along the Mekong if I could

Daddy was the coolest kid in school
He was always in the alley sniffing glue
Yeah, he did it till his little lips turned blue

See you in the park at dark
Talking better bout the dad that you never knew
Yeah, talking bout the things you said you'd do

Yes, I'm sorry
There's no use in being close-hearted
Yeah, guess you did the best that you could

Got held up on my way to North Pigalle
Must have got off in the wrong arrondissement
One more stop and you would have found God

I killed I don't know
But I'm doing fine, the weather is good
Go back and show you if I could

Really got to go?
Yeah man, already
See then go, ah man
They already

I don't think of it at all
Cause dear, they're all gone

Call head on for
They already

Yeah, I've been good
Yeah

See them go
Get out and go
Fire off another round

Still I've been gone
But I'm already

Did you go into the door?
Way out purple kind of person
We, perfect eye

Said, well the way I'm going
I, I, I, I die, I, I, I, O

I, I, I been good man
Said I don't really know

Do it always fire
before they go

Now the sky's all red
Elevating
and all this time

Way I been going
I'm already gone
