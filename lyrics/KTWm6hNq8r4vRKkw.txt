My lullaby, shines a lot on a lonely road
Black it out, curl up inside, we go
(bah doo, bah doo, bah doo, bah doo)

A heart, it lives and breaths
But most of all it makes anger fly
But new horizons change the way, I sigh

Oh, a fire's burning
Undertow, undertow
Oh, you shock me darling
Undertow, undertow

Breathing feels so much harder now
Water lungs, isolation, we're bound
Swim surface now, don't you let coral take you low
Choking chone europhia, anchored

Oh, a fire's burning
Undertow, undertow
Oh, you shock me darling
Undertow, undertow

(Bass Solo)

Oh, a fire's burning,
Undertow, undertow,
Oh, you shock me darling,
Undertow, undertow
