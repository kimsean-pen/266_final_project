Ouija Board
Would you work for me?
I have got to say
"Hello to an old friend"

Ouija Board, Ouija Board, Ouija Board
Would you work for me?
I have got to get through
To a good friend

Well she has now gone
From this unhappy planet
With all the carnivores
And the destructor's on it

Ouija Board, Ouija Board, Ouija Board
Would you help me?
Because I still do feel
So horribly lonely

Would you, Ouija Board
Would you, Ouija Board
Would you help me?
And I just can't find
My place in this world

Well she has now gone
From this unhappy planet
With all the carnivores
And the destructor's of it

Oh hear my voice
(Hear my voice)
Oh hear my voice
(Hear my voice)

Hear my voice
(Hear my voice, my voice)
Hear my voice
(Voice)
Table is rumbling

The table is rumbling
The glass is moving
No I was not pushing that time, it spells
S T E V E N

The table is rumbling
The glass is moving
No I was not pushing that time
P U S H O double F

Well she has now gone
From this unhappy planet
With all the carnivores
And the destructor's on it
