So many little things followed me
So many little things that bothered me
Because I am not your answer
But I found my answer
From all the chaos that followed me
I have found my answer

I've told you before don't follow me
I am not alone, I am not afraid, I am not unhappy
These are the words I say to myself everyday
But I'm not alone
I am not alone, I am not afraid, I am not unhappy
Tell me what ritual I should have today
I've resolved so many things and set myself free

I am not alone, I am not afraid, I am not unhappy
The words I say to myself every day
I am not alone, I am not afraid, I am not unhappy
Such a stupid ritual to have to say to myself everyday
I'm not unhappy
I'm not alone but I found my answer and set myself free
I'm not alone and I'm not unhappy

Not alone and I'm not unhappy
I'm not alone, I'm not afraid
And I'm not afraid, not unhappy
Eleven point two, eleven point two
I'm not alone, I'm not afraid
I'm not alone, I'm not afraid

I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid
These are the words I say to myself everyday
I am not alone. I am not afraid. I am not unhappy
I am not alone. I am not afraid. I am not unhappy

I'm not afraid
And I am not alone. I am not afraid. I'm not unhappy
The words I say to myself everyday
I am not alone. I am not afraid. I am not unhappy
Such a stupid ritual to have to say to myself everyday
I'm not alone but I found my answer and set myself free
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not unhappy
