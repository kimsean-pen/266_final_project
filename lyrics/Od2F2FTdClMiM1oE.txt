When i wake into the Morning Sun,
Well i feel another day has just begun.
I see those clouds up in the sky,
and i don't care, everything is going to be alright.

And i wan't you to know, some feelings come and go
but for you mine will never change.
It's harder than it seems to know what to believe,
here in my mind i hold you close.

Well i have never seen a face like yours,
It makes me smile just when i think of you for sure.
and all we have is all we have to show,
and all we need is here for free. Just thought i'd let you know.

And when i hold you close, it's you i love the most,
you take my loneliness away.
I saw you in my dreams and then you came to me.
will you be mine?, i only hope.
