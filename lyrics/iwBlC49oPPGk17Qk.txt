I had a friend many years ago
One tragic night he died
The saddest time of my life
For weeks and weeks I cried
Through the anger and through the tears
I've felt his spirit through the years
I'd swear, He's Watching Over Me
Guiding me through hard times

()
I feel it once again
It's overwhelming me
His spirit's like the wind
The angel guarding me
Oh, I know, oh, I know
He's Watching Over Me
Oh, I know, oh, I know

He's Watching Over Me

We shred dreams like all bests friends
Blood brothers at the age of ten
We lived reckless, he paid the price
But why? Why did he have to die?
It still hurts me to this day
Am I selfish for feeling this way?

I know he's an angel now
Together we'll be someday

I feel it once again
It's overwhelming me
His spirit's like the wind
The angel guarding me
Oh, I know, oh, I know
He's Watching Over Me
Oh, I know, oh, I know
He's Watching Over Me
His spirit's like the wind
The angel guarding me
Oh, I know, oh, I know
He's Watching Over Me
Oh, I know, oh, I know
He's Watching Over Me
