Bypassed the day I can hear them coming
They walk round my door and speak of their coming
My trial awaits got nowhere to run
My only words how soon you have come

And I think about what you told me
When I was about to join in

Defy only if you have a way to resist the lies
Decline only if you have the intention of taking this advice

Who brought me here this place is familiar
Where houses are black under the sun
Strangers pass on streets with strange names
All I can think is how soon they have come

And I think about what you told me
When I was about to join in

Defy only if you have a way to resist the lies
Decline only if you have the intention of taking this advice
Apply only if you're not afraid to see your spirit die
Retreat only if you dare not hear yourself say goodbye

Look at me now they have cut my hair
It's a long way back
They kicked me down and I could not rise
I will never arrive

Defy only if you have a way to resist the lies
Decline only if you have the intention of taking this advice
