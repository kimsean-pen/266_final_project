No one said it would be easy
Did anyone tell you the road
Would be straight and long
Relax your mind and give it all to me

'Coz you know and I know
Our love is strong enough
To weather the rain
To weather the snow
To weather the storm

To weather the rain
To weather the snow
To weather the storm

Often I see fear in your eyes
And sometimes I know
Your heart is full of little arrows
But trusting me and no one can do you wrong

'Coz I know and you know
Our love is strong enough
To weather the rain
To weather the snow
To weather the storm

To weather the rain
To weather the snow
To weather the storm

To weather the rain
To weather the snow
To weather the storm

To weather the rain
To weather the snow
To weather the storm
