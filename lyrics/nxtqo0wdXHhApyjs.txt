As the the winds blows in passing
Baby I could fall in love with you
Where you go, where you go
Baby, What you do
You know you gotta get your hustle on
So baby gone, baby gone, don't be long.
Baby gone, baby gone, don't be long.
Wu Wuu
Baby gone, baby gone, don't be long.
Baby gone, baby gone, don't be long.

Where you going why don't you stop
Baby what's the rush.
You got me felling like a girl with the faintest crush. (hey)
Where you go, where you go,
I miss you much.
But I know you gotta get your hustle on.

Gone, Gone Baby gone baby, don't be long.
Gone Baby gone baby, don't be long.
Ooh ooooh
Gone Baby gone baby, don't be long.
I know you gotta get your hustle on.
Gone Baby gone baby, don't be long.
Gone Baby gone baby, don't be long.
Ooh oooh
Gone Baby gone baby, don't be long.
I know you gotta get your hustle on.

I can't wait to see what you do
It's not too much to follow you through
I can't wait to see what you be
Go be here cause I believe
So don't go
There is only one thing I'm still asking
Why I feel you masking
If it's love that you feel that is really real
And I know you gotta get your hustle on.
You laugh baby laugh what's the rush
When we touch I wanna know if it's love or lust
I fell like a girl with the faintest crush
And I know you gotta get your hustle on.

Gone, Gone Baby gone baby, don't be long. (gone baby)
Gone Baby gone baby, don't be long.
(Uu Uuuu)
Gone Baby gone baby, don't be long.
Gone Baby gone baby, don't be long.
I can't wait to see how you move. (how you move)
I try to watch what you do what you do (what you do)
I can't wait to see what you be
Go be here cause I believe
So don't go, baby.
Gone Baby gone baby, don't be long.
(Uu Uuuu)
So, gone Baby gone baby, don't be long.
Gone baby, don't be long.
Don't be long
Uuu, baby don't be long.
