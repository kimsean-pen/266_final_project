Many prophets preach on bended knee
Many clerics wasted wine
Do the bloodied sheets on those cobbled streets
Mean I have wasted time

Are there silver shores on paradise
Can I come in from the cold
I killed a man in a far away land
My enemy I'm told

I really want you to really want me
But I really don't know if you can do that (I really want you)
I know you want to know what's right
But I know it's so hard for you to do that (I really want you)
And time's running out as often it does
And often dictates that you can't do that (I really want you)
But fate can't break this feeling inside
That's burning up through my veins

I really want you
I really want you
I really want you
Now

No matter what I say or do
The message isn't getting through
And you're listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart

I really want you
I really want you

Is a poor man rich in solitude
Or will mother earth complain
Did the beggar pray for a sunny day but
Lady luck for rain

They say a million people bow and scrape
To an effigy of gold
I saw life begin
On the ship we're in
Then history unfold

I really want you to really want me
But I really don't know if you can do that (I really want you)
I know you want to know what's right
But I know It's so hard for you to do that (I really want you)
And time's running out as often it does
And often dictates that you can't do that (I really want you)
Fate can't break this feeling inside
That's burning up through my veins

I really want you
I really want you
I really want you
Now
No matter what I say or do
The message isn't getting through
And you're listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart
No matter what I say or do
The message isn't getting through
And you're listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart
