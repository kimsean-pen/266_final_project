On my life
I know for sure
We've entered a puppet show
Got my guard up, watch my back
Straight ahead, no turning back
Could say I can take no more
But it'd do no good at all
I could try to walk away
Or just win the game they play
So
Should we go?
Should we go?
Should we go right now, see?
Let 'em know
Let 'em know
That I'm (I'll be) new in town
Oh
Should we go?
Should we go?
Should we go right now, see?
Let 'em know
Let 'em know
I'm 'a tear shit down

Look at me with the drop top back
Watchin with your mouth open
In the Valley Of dolls
Baby, look me
With the pom poms
Tricked 'em out, make you like me
I'm in the Valley of dolls
I'm not half that star
But I got more stats
'Cuz, uh, I just know where to go
You know where you are now, you know where you are
Don't you know you living in the Valley of the dolls?

Open eyes, not like before
Watch them wind up more and more
Rip the tethers from their back
Simulates a heart attack
Jaws all dropped down to the floor
Not like us, cause an uproar
Well it seems they're on to me
Dolls don't fuck wit a queen bee
Oh
Should we go?
Should we go?
Should we go right now, see?
Let 'em know
Let 'em know
That I'm (I'll be) new in town
Say
Should we go?
Should we go?
Should we go right now, see?
Let 'em know
Let 'em know
I'm 'a tear shit down

Look at me with the drop top back
Watchin with your mouth open
In the Valley of dolls
Baby, look me
With the pom poms
Tricked 'em out, make you like me
I'm in the Valley of dolls
I'm not half that star
But I got more stats
'Cuz, uh, I just know where to go
You know where you are now, you know where you are

Don't you know you living in the Valley of the dolls?
The Valley of the dolls

Even I can't pass through the Valley of the dolls
Without cursing to myself the day I came, the day I came
Even I can't pass throughout the Valley of the dolls
Throughout the Valley of the dolls
And be the same, and be the same
