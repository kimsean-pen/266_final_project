my darling
you love him
clock sticking
don't waste your time
it would be selfish to leave him
but you are distant, don't waste your time
he come, they go
so replace upon as long as your own breath pull flows
his eyes they're low as distraction fault
as long as your own river flow
don't waste your time
don't chase your time
don't waste your time
as long as your own breath pull flows
powers can and time would trail
and i hold on to our cheers
my love, i could not fear when i run out with you .me
when i run out with me
when i run out with me
when i run out with me
when i run out with me
don't waste your time
don't waste your time
don't waste your time
as long as your own river flows
(don't waste your time)
(don't waste your time)
(don't waste your time)
