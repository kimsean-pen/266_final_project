I am a man of a million things that you can't stand
You're just a girl that's everything not in my world
Cause I stop, and you go
And I run, too slow but let me go, go, go

It's in the palm of your hands
If you threw it away it would be just to say you did(Ooo-Woah, Ooo-Woah-O)
I should have known, not to trust you
You were too good to be true
And then your kiss left a taste on my lips
And your eyes how they glow

I've got a question for you,
How many hearts does it take for you to get straight through just one city
Cause I stop, and you go
And I run, too slow but let me go, go, go!

It's in the palm of your hands
If you threw it away it would be just to say you did(Ooo-Woah, Ooo-Woah-O)
I should have known, not to trust you
You were too good to be true
And then your kiss left a taste on my lips
And your eyes how they glow

*I'm taking back what's mine
You took it from me and I want it back
What is rightfully mine
You'll never see our faces again!*

You're feeling cornered
Try being the victims of your lies
You say it's torture
I think it's time for you to go
It's really time for you to go

Woooaahhhh! Woooaahhhh! Woooaahhhh!

Woooaahhhh! Woooaahhhh! Woooaahhhh!
(You're feeling cornered
Try being the victims of your lies
You say it's torture
I think it's time for you to go
It's really time for you to go)
