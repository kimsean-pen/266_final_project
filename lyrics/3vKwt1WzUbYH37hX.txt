I'll give you one night only
For your eyes only
Oh, oh, oh

Like an eagle in the sky
You can't control it
There's a magic in my eyes
And I can't stop it burning down
On the edge of tonight
Cause tomorrow we'll be owning the world

All my scars have got a tune
There's a fire in my heart
And I can't stop it burning down
On the edge of tonight
Cause tomorrow we'll be ruling the world

And you know like pure, white gold
I'll give you one night only
For your eyes only
If entertaining's what you want
Then honey, I'm the best!
I know that we're together
For all your pleasure
Forever, forever, forever
This is how we burn

Yeah! I wanna run into the night
Supersonic
Like a dragon in the sky
Riding on it
Screaming loud
At the edge of tonight
Cause tomorrow we'll be ruling the world!

On the run, I'm in the mood
There's a bullet in the gun
And I'm gonna shoot it above the clouds
I'll get it tonight
Cause tomorrow we'll be ruling the world

You know like pure, white gold
I'll give you one night only
For your eyes only
If entertaining's what you want
Then honey, I'm the best!
I know that we're together
For all your pleasure
Forever, forever, forever
This is how we burn

This is how we burn
This is how we burn
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

I just wanna ride
I just wanna turn and face the strange
Sometimes the fear in us
Turns to the best of us

I just wanna have some fun
I just wanna throw that one, two punch
Sometimes the tear in us
Turns to the best of us

I'll give you one night only
For your eyes only
If entertaining's what you want
Then honey, I'm the best!

I'll give you one night only
For your eyes only
If entertaining's what you want
Then honey, I'm the best!
I know that we're together
For all your pleasure
Forever, forever, forever
This is how we burn

This is how we burn
This is how we burn
