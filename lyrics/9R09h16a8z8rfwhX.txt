Limped up like a dog with three legs (shut-up) to the stage...
So many dark arts to choose
You can focus to the phobias involved in forty hues
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Tune into the prudence of the
Dark Heart News

Breathin's a tug of war
Wet when I rush the Ball
Flushed, 29 bust gum stuck
Clutch the door
Slumped in the back burn +Bush+ by the son of +George+
Sweat tear and feed
Cause I don't bleed when I cut no more

A system of gods
From each of the brawling tribes
So my bobble is a pot of qualms, clipped and collaged
Pavlov's bad dogs parry mass bells
I don't speak the language but my last laughs held

Spiraled get vertigo
Signals the flash and beep
Postin my head for myself to get back to me
Pouch full of dynamite
Blast cap anatomy
Bags full of smelling salts
Mad as the magazine attack
Medic, Stretcher, Call
Cracked, Crazy, Header, Fall
A threat, a break, a mistake with a pulse
Pickin' every last fuckin piece of paint off the walls

Okay the rotary corner
Grow to be notably mobile
And social gopher teeth form holes
Where any seam work breaths normally
We'll locate every exit, had seconds to flee the wormhole
When emergency diversions ring the celly or the door bell

Burning it at both ends
Friends let's commiserate
Turn it into something to the sound that the triggers make
Born at the baddest sign
Half this time, still awake
Training all my zeros to perform like your figure 8

'ey, four corners of the globe All invent fire on the very same day in the very same cold
Each sent a man with torch to the border line to boast
Watch them collide and explode

When I peel the blinds back
Up jump the irons call
Monkey wrench in my hands
Razor cut the islands off
Homemade taps Memories
Diagonal to private calls
And ever since the 80's
Adding something to my Tylenols

What plague?
Make it out of limb brigades
So if we're to walk planks
Then we'll climb a tree and wait
Your irony is waiting over piety and faith
So when (?)
We'll kindly disobey it
I will live to be a thousand with the patience of a saint
And see the (?) becoming restless in their tanks
Can't hold howls and corrals with a key
So will the worms please shriek on the count of three
(FREAK!)

If I had a dollar
For every time I couldn't sleep
I could buy a million locks
And finally read a book in peace
Normal with my president and come off as a crooked thief
And turn my heart so dark that it would bark when he looked for me

Sideways eye on a sinister boundary
Kind of looking temporary's killing my loudly
99 Models of fear on the wall timorous
Done running into to the car on the wrong cinder blocks

Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Three legged dogs that chew up the wrong food
Riff Raff...
Land sharks know to take money, money, lose

AHH!
