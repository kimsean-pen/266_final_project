Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer Mamma sez that you was real
Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer Mamma sez that you was real

Ready or not, come what may
The bets are goin' down for Judgement Day
So put yer money in yer mouth
And yer hands right upon the wheel

Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer Pappa sez that you was real
Put yer money where yer mouth is
Your pappa sez that you was real

Ready or not, and come what may
You bets are goin' down on Judgement Day
So put yer money in your mouth
And yer hands right upon the wheel
Oow

Ahh
Ahh
Ahh

Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer Mamma sez that you was real
Put your money where yer mouth is
Yer Mamma sez that you was real

Ready or not, and come what may
The bets are goin' down for Judgement Day
So put yer money in yer mouth
And yer hands right upon the wheel

Ahh
Ahh
Ahh

Watch out
Baby, watch out
No no no no no no, watch out
Baby watch out
Woo

Ahh
Ahh
Ahh
