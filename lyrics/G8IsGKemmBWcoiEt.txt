The curse has begin
Yesterday's gone
Now there is so much to do
Illusion and fear
Confusion and tears
It's more than any cross could bear
The cuse of love
The cuse of love
Emperors will crawl
Empires will fall
And the soldiers
They'll hang their ends
Time strikes it's code??
The bullets straight trough the heart
The cuse of love
The cuse of love
