Bits, a handful of irregular bits
A colored glass colors the light
Warms up my spine

Stars, flat six-pointed stars
Hexagon like baby blocks
I've sewn a cloth

True hallucination speak
Inhale
You better get a friend to help you
Exhale
Against the stream
You've got to make amends with the truth

Glide, a living language collides
Chrysanthemum like mandala
Gave birth two eyes

True hallucination speak
Inhale
You better get a friend to help you
Exhale
Against the stream
You've got to make amends with the truth

Pop
Pop snap crackle and pop
Science fiction memory
Interleaved
Illuminates the heart
And I won't let you down
I might come from outer-space
But I'm here with you now
And we'll travel between worlds

Inhale
You better get a friend to help you
Exhale
Against the stream
You've got to make amends with the truth

The shimmer of that sound in the mouth
Love's design accomplished
