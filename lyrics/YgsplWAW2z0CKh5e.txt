Floating like a smoke ring
It cannot be regained
Now it's touched, it's broken
The taste just slips away
The taste just slips away
I just want to know

The taste just slips away
The taste just slips away
I just want to know

I don't want to tell you
What you want to know
I don't want to tell you

As hard as right can be
It can feel so wrong
Too much to leave
Now it's all gone wrong

It's all gone wrong
But what's right or wrong?
I don't know
I don't know
The taste just slips away
