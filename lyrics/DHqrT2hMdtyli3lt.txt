Buddy you're a boy make a big noise
Playing in the street gonna be a big man some day
You got mud on yo' face
You big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place
Singing

We will we will rock you
We will we will rock you

Buddy you're a young man hard man
Shouting in the street gonna take on the world some day
You got blood on yo' face
You big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

We will we will rock you
Sing it
We will we will rock you

Buddy you're an old man poor man
Pleading with your eyes gonna make
You some peace some day
You got mud on your face
Big disgrace
Somebody betta put you back into your place

Do it

We will we will rock you
Yeah, yeah, come on
We will we will rock you
All right

We will we will rock you
One more time
We will we will rock you
