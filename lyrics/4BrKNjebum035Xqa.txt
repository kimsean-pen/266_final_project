Fire
Alight the new beginning
Desire
Make this life worth living

Hands are shaking
Heart is breaking
It's for the taking
Every single thing

Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear

Fire
Cleanse the world that would hold me back
Desire
By the throat I release you
Goodbye

Hands are shaking
Heart is breaking
It's for the taking
Every single thing

Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear
Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear

We start this fire
We start this fire
The way we always do
We start this fire
The way we always do
Let the flames consume

The way we always do
Let the flames consume

Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear
Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
