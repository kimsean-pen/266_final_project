Björk
My blood flows in me
My red juice in my veins
My blood travels fast
My blood rushes through me
When I need you
My blood flows faster
My veins turn into molten mud

I'm turning in, turning in to
Turning in to the [?]

I was made long ago
My blood makes me remember
I was made out of mud
My red juice makes me remember
When I need you
My blood goes faster
My veins turn into molten mud

Einar
Half of me
I'm punctured
I'm leaking
The air is out
Blasted into space like
Burst balloons
I'm punctured
I'm leaking
Half of me
There's a hole on you too
Into you
Half of me
It's the beginning half of me

Björk
When I need you
My blood goes faster
My veins turn into molten mud

I'm turning in, turning in to
Turning in to the [?]

Einar
Half of me, half of me
Half of me,
I'm a jellyfish!
Burst balloon!
Half of me, half of me
Into space, into space
Burst balloon!
Half of me,
No jellyfish, no jellyfish!
