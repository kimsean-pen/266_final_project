Alone in the night, Frijo is crying;
she has been left by her husband
who had to leave to fight the
darkness of matter. Thoughts
of what once was flow through
her mind; their play in the green
grass and under colourful trees,
wonderful fields of flowers,
fresh fruits and berries, and beautiful
music from the elven choirs.
Running waters make them dream,
lakes where they bathed, riverfalls
and marvellous clouds in the sky.
They were happy, they had their
Golden Age. Now, all she has
left are her Golden Tears,
that run from her skyblue eyes,
as a witness to what once was -
to what is lost forever; until a New
World is born, after Ragnarok.
In the meantime,
give our dear Frijo some
warm thoughts, to help her through
the cold nights.
