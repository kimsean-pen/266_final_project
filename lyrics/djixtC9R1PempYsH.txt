Now kid I know I haven't been a perfect man
And I've avoided doing things I know I can
But if I learned one thing the tattoo on my arm
Will burn into my thumb It would be that

You must stick up for yourself son
Never mind what anybody else done
Stick up for yourself son
Never mind what anybody else done
Stick up for yourself son
Never mind what anybody else done

Now Old Man Schlemming was a formidable foe
The Ambling Alp was too at least that's what I'm told
But if you learn one thing then learn this well
In June you must get past yourself
They'll run but they can't hide

You must stick up for yourself son
Never mind what anybody else done
Stick up for yourself son
Never mind what anybody else done
Stick up for yourself son
Never mind what anybody else done

And when those thunder clouds are cryin
(in the sky, in the sky)
And when those fireflies keep shining,
(In your eyes, in your eyes)
Keep your eyes on the shine,
keep your minds on the line,
Keep your feet and slide
(into the sky, into the sky)

Now the world can be an unfair place at times
But your lows will have their compliment of highs
And if anyone should cheat you
Take advantage of or beat you raise your hand
And wear your wounds with pride

You must stick up for yourself son
Never mind what anybody else done
Stick up for yourself son
Never mind what anybody else done
Stick up for yourself son
Never mind what anybody else done
