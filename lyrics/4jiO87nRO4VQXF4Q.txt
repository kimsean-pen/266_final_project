I've got a loud mouth.
Always thinking out loud.
So drown me out.
You've got a mean mouth.
You've got a pretty mean mouth.
You've got a pretty way about you when you drown me out.
There's nothing to talk about when we talk about love.
I've had a bad thought on my mind for too long.
Afraid to open up my mouth.
So drown me out.
