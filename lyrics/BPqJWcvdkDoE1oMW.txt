High above the mountains, far across the sea
I can hear your voice callin' out to me
Brighter than the sun and darker than the night
I can see your love shinin' like a light

And on and on this Earth spins like a carousel
If I could travel across the world
The secrets, I would tell

You and I were meant to fly
Higher than the clouds we'll sail across the sky
So come with me and you will feel
That we're soarin', that we're floatin' up so high
'Cause you and I were meant to fly

Sailin' like a bird, high on the wings of love
Take me higher than all the stars above
I'm burnin', yearnin, gently turnin' round and round
I'm always risin' up, I never want to come back down

You and I were meant to fly
Higher than the clouds we'll sail across the sky
So come with me (so come with me)
And you will feel (and you will feel)
That we're soarin', that we're floatin' up so high
'Cause you and I were meant to fly, fly

Oh, yeah

You and I were meant to fly (were meant to fly)
Higher than the clouds we'll sail across the sky
So come with me (so come with me)
And you will feel (and you will feel)
That you and I were meant to fly
You and I were meant to fly
