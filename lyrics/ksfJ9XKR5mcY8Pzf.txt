The coldest wind hit me so hard
I raise my fist
I slip apart
Oh oh
Nothing compares nothing at all
Just like my tears
I let them fall
Oh oh
It's in my blood
This dizzy vein
It never cared of all my pain
Oh oh
So lead me on into your web
It's just a ride that's in my head
Oh oh

Kind of driven and kind of triggered on
I watch the woods trying to find those inner gods
Hold it back just to try to hold it in
Just like the devil that stayed ready to win
No competition still I'm acting on a race
Watching angels dancing in the slow of ways
Got to let it go
But I can't
Got to let it go
But I
Oh oh
