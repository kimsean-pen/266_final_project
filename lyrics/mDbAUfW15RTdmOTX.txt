Woke up in a really shitty mood
First thing that I thought about was you
I'm trying really hard to play it cool
But that's some shit I never learnt in school
If you ask me then I'll say
Everything is great

Once upon a time we had it all
Played you my first single in the car
You said "Don't forget my name when you're a star"
Said I'll take you with me to the top
Ain't it funny how things change
I just gotta say that

I miss you like crazy
This bed is so lonely
But if you ask me then I'll say
Everything is great

Going through the pictures on my phone
Know I should delete them but I don't
They make me feel a little less alone
When I'm in the air or touching road
Wish I could call and say "I know it's getting late"
But

I miss you like crazy (I do, I do, I do)
This bed is so lonely (Without you in it too)
I know people say I've changed
But I still feel the same
Still miss you like crazy (I do, I do, I do)
This house is so empty (Without you in it too)
But if you ask me then I'll say
Everything is great

Mid September
After party
Take me home, it's past 4:23
Don't forget me, please
Woke up in a really shitty mood
First thing that I thought about was you
Fuck

I miss you like crazy (I do, I do, I do)
This bed is so lonely (Without you in it too)
I know people say I've changed
But I still feel the same
Still miss you like crazy (I do, I do, I do)
This house is so empty (Without you in it too)
But if you ask me then I'll say
Everything is great
