Everything we know
is from the radio
Everything we dream
Is never what they seem
Feeling rather strange
Waiting for a change
Fearing what's to come
Acting kind of dumb
I'm indigo and violet and blue
I'm so in love with you!
Everything you ever want is here
Giving up another one too dear
Listen to the night
Humming with delight
Feel euphoria
On the fioor with you
I'm indigo and violet and blue
I'm so in love with you!
Lingering and laying in the cold Galvanize my soul
Still getting over you
Still getting over, getting over you
Still getting over you
Still getting over, getting over you
I'm running through the fields
Waiting to be healed
