When I was 19
There were places that I wanted to see
When I was 20
Cornell University
And Kefalonia
Didn't mean anything to me
I read the classics
But I didn't read thoroughly

When I go to Ithaca
When I come back
From America
You'll be with me

You found freedom
In a chamber of the library
You pull the roots up
With the old etymology
In Kefalonia
And the blue Ionian sea
The way I know ya
Is like an old old olive tree

When I go to Ithaca
When I come back
From America
You'll be with me

When I go to Ithaca
When I come back
To South Africa
You'll be with me
