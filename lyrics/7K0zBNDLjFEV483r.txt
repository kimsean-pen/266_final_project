On a night like this I could fall in love
I could fall in love with you
In this dark so dense, we talk so soft
The way young lovers do
The days last sight turns to cool nights breeze
And this love hangs thick like these willow leaves
Ive hid myself away from this
But your silhouette is true love's kiss

On a night like this the moon sits still
And the stars are watching to
The way you move is a lullaby
I could fall in love with you
The days last sight turns to cool nights breeze
And this love hangs thick like these willow leaves
Ive hid myself away from this
But your silhouette is true love's kiss

On a night like this i could fall in love
i could fall in love with you
