Take me down to LA
I wanna go down
I wanna go down
Will you want me yesterday
I've been hiding in your room
Just hide in the room

I will hurt you anyway
It's a matter of our time
Just a matter of my, my time

Do you even know what I want?
What I hold tonight?
Tonight

Take me down to LA
I want to see you
I want to see you
Will you want me right away
I've been hiding in your mind
Just hiding in your mind

You will hurt me either way
It's a matter of your time
I'm a matter of your
Your time

Stop using me
Stop using me
I wanna feel you
I wanna feel
Stop using me
I wanna feel you
I wanna feel
Tonight
Tonight

Do you even know what I want?
What I hold tonight?

Take me down to LA
I want to go down
I want to go down
Will you want me yesterday
I've been hiding in your room
Just hiding in your room

You will hurt me, either way
You're only in my mind
You're only in my mind
Do you even know what I want?
What I hold tonight?
