Stay, my baby
Stay, my baby
Summer love isn't meant to be
And it's only a fantasy

That's what everyone's telling me
Stay, my baby
Even though it's a little rushed
Let me know that you'll keep in touch

If you don't it'll hurt too much
Stay, my baby
Oh, oh, tell me right now
Oh, oh, how it's going down

Everything will be okay
Everything will be alright
I know that it'll go my way
If you stay, my baby
I'm never gonna give you up

I'm never gonna have enough

So now 'til forever, stay, my baby
Now that I've gone back to school
All I do is think of you
Sitting up here in my room
Going crazy

But then you call
Gets me through it all
Every time I hear you say
Stay, my baby
Everything will be okay
Everything will be alright
I know that it'll go my way
If you stay, my baby
I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never gonna have enough
So now 'til forever, stay, my baby
Stay, my baby, stay, my baby
Stay, my baby, stay, my baby
Oh, oh, tell me right now
Oh, oh, how it's going down
Everything will be okay
Everything will be alright
I know that it'll go my way
If you stay, my baby
So I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never gonna have enough
So now 'til forever, stay, my baby
Stay, my baby, stay, my baby
Stay, my baby, stay, my baby
I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never gonna have enough
So now 'til forever, stay, my baby
Stay, my baby
