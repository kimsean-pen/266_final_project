Let me hold you for the last time
It's the last chance to feel again
But you broke me
Now I can't feel anything

When I love you, it's so untrue
I can't even convince myself
When I'm speaking
It's the voice of someone else

Oh, it tears me up
I try to hold on but it hurts too much
I try to forgive but it's not enough
To make it all okay

You can't play on broken strings
You can't feel anything
That your heart don't want to feel
I can't tell you something that ain't real

Oh, the truth hurts
A lie's worse
How can I give anymore
When I love you a little less than before?

Oh, what are we doing?
We are turning into dust
Playing house in the ruins of us

Running back through the fire
When there's nothing left to save
It's like chasing the very last train
When it's too late...
Too late

Oh, it tears me up
I try to hold on but it hurts too much
I try to forgive but it's not enough
To make it all okay

You can't play on broken strings
You can't feel anything
That your heart don't want to feel
I can't tell you something that ain't real

Oh, the truth hurts
A lie's worse
How can I give anymore
When I love you a little less than before?

Oh, we're running to the fire
When there's nothing left to save
It's like chasing the very last train
When we both know it's too late
Too late

You can't play on broken strings
You can't feel anything
That your heart don't want to feel
I can't tell you something that ain't real

Oh, the truth hurts
A lie's worse
So how can I give anymore
When I love you a little less than before?
Oh you know that I love you a little less than before, yeah

Let me hold you for the last time
It's the last chance to feel again
