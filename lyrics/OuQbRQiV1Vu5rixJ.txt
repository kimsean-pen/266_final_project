Bringin' da noise
Bring down the house
We came here to turn the party out
Say, c'mon c'mon let's raise the roof
And give 'em proof that we can get loose y'all
Bringin' da noise
Bring down the house
We came here to turn the party out
Say, c'mon c'mon let's raise the roof
And give 'em proof that we can get loose y'all

Need to get down
The scene is oh so right
Everybody's in the house tonight (tonight)
Lose your mind
Let your body take control
You've got to feel it in your soul (in your soul)

I've got that feelin' baby
You know it drives me crazy
And all I wanna do is hit the floor
I wanna shout it y'all
So make it louder y'all
And turn it up some more

Bringin' da noise
Bring down the house
We came here to turn the party out
Say, c'mon c'mon let's raise the roof
And give 'em proof that we can get loose
Bringin' da noise
Bring down the house
We came here to turn the party out
Say, c'mon c'mon let's raise the roof
And give 'em proof that we can get loose

Bringin' da noise
Bringin' da noise

Just shake it down
And enjoy the ride
Do what you feel inside
Cause it's your world
All you want and more
So baby go and get yours

I've got that feelin' baby
You know it drives me crazy
And all I wanna do is hit the floor
I wanna shout it y'all
So make it louder y'all
And turn it up some more

Bringin' da noise
