Every night she comes
to take me out to dreamland
when i'm with her, i'm the richest
man in the town
she's a rose, she's the pearl
she's the spin on my world
all the stars make their wishes on her eyes
she's my coney island baby
she's my coney island girl
she's a princess, in a red dress
she's the moon in the mist to me
she's my coney island baby
she's my coney island girl
