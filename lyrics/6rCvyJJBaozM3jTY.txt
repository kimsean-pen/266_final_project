I don't recall the last time we spoke
You said it's my fault, I still don't believe you, oh Arkansas
We both know this was a mistake
I'd love to come home but I need an escape, oh Arkansas

Fade out
This is where the credits roll our name

Taller than trees and brighter than starlight
I never feel magic unless I'm with you, oh Arkansas
Tell me you mean it when you tell me you love me
I wanna believe you, I wanna believe you, oh Arkansas

Fade out
This is where the credits roll our name

I don't recall the last time we spoke
You said it's my fault, I still don't believe you, oh Arkansas
Tell you mean it when you tell me you love me
I wanna believe you, I wanna believe you, oh Arkansas

Fade out
This is where the credits roll our name
