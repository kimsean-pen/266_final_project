Help me
I need your love
Don't walk away
The dark scares me so
We're nothing apart
Let's stay friends forever
Forever
Here I stand and face the rain
I know that nothing's gonna be the same again
I fear for what tomorrow brings
Trust me
For whom I am
Place all your faith
Into these hands
I've got nothing to say
But, "Let's stay friends forever."
Forever
Here I stand and face the rain
I know that nothing's gonna be the same again
I fear for what tomorrow brings
Here I stand and face the rain (Stand and face the rain)
I know that nothing's gonna be the same again (Nothing's gonna be the same)
I fear for what tomorrow brings
Aaahhhhhhaaaaaa (Aaaaahhhhhhaaaa)
Here I stand and face the rain (Aahhaa)
Knowing nothing's gonna be the same (Ahhaa)
Again
Ahhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaa
Ahhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaa
