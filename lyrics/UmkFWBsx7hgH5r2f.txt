Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back, hurry back, hurry back, hurry back

My arms are missing you
My lips feel the same way too
I tried so hard to be true
Just like I promised to do
But this boy keeps a-coming around
He trying to wear my resistance down
Come on

Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?

Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back,
You better hurry back,
Better hurry back, better hurry back
Come on now

He calls me up on the phone
About three times a day
Now my heart's not listening
To what he has to say
But this loneliness inside me is reaching out to be his friend
Come on

Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?

Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
And are you coming back?
And are you coming back?
And are you coming back?
I need your loving, Jimmy!

Come on, come on, come on
Hey, hey, hey
Jimmy Mack, come on even man
Come on

Come on now
Come, come on now
Come on, Jimmy

I'm not saying I'm getting much stronger
Can't hold on very much longer
I know I tried to be true
It was Jimmy talks just as sweet as you

Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back
Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
And are you coming back?
And are you coming back?
And are you coming back?
I need your loving!

Come on, Jimmy
Come on now
Ay, ay
Jimmy Mack
Come, come, come on now, Jimmy
Come on, come on, come on, Jimmy
Jimmy, Jimmy, come on
Uh, Jimmy
Come on now, Jimmy
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Come on, Jimmy
Ooh, come back, come back, come back now, Jimmy
Come on, Jimmy
Come on, come back, Jimmy
Come on, Jimmy

You better hurry back
And are you coming back?
When are you coming back?
And are you coming back?
I need your loving, Jimmy
