Get possessed by the dj
You'll scream like Linda Blair
Pick up a trick or treat and
Come to the party tonightmare

Pre-You grab a drink drink
I'll grab a knife knife
This is the end of the rest of your life life
You grab a drink drink
I'll grab a knife knife
This is the end of the rest of your life life

This club woah!
It's a ha-ha-haunted house
Ha-ha-haunted house
This club woah!
It's a ha-ha-haunted house
Ha-ha-haunted house

This club woah!
It's a ha-ha-haunted house
Ha-ha-haunted house
This club woah!
It's a ha-ha-haunted house
Ha-ha-haunted house

Is that a monster in your pocket
Or are you just happy to see me?
We'll make you tingle like William Castle
T. G. I. F. The 13th!

Pre-You grab a drink drink
I'll grab a knife knife
This is the end of the rest of your life life
You grab a drink drink
I'll grab a knife knife
This is the end of the rest of your life life

This club woah!
It's a ha-ha-haunted house
Ha-ha-haunted house

Ha-ha-haunted house

Demons on the dance floor
I've tasted blood and I want more
Demons on the dance floor
I've tasted blood and I want more more
And I want more more
And I want more more
Boo!
I scared you

This club woah!
It's a ha-ha-haunted house
