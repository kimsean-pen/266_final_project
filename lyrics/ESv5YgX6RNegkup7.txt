You took my heart - misery
you taught me blues
well i got a lot of patience baby
that's a lot of patience to lose
i'm crying - i'm mad at my country
now i've been treated bad
when i was a freeport and you were the main drag.
Broken blues - i just don't know
little bird, flying by my window
take me where you go
i'm crying - i'm looking at these times
and it's bound to drive me mad
when i was a freeport and you were the main drag.
What did i do?
everybody's putting me down
i keep running
but the law kept coming around.
So fare thee well - happiness
cause i got blues
and i got a lot of patience baby
that's a lot of patience to lose
i'm a woman
waiting for due time
now i've been treated bad
when i was a freeport and you were the main drag
