I wake in the night
To find you on my mind
Deep in a dream
You'll always be
Til the end of time

I look in your eyes
They touch my soul
My love is hard to hide
I'm never alone when we're apart
I feel you by my side

And here in my heart
Where no one else will ever be
I know who you are
So lock the door
And throw away the key

Save all your love
Save your love for me
When I'm alone at night
You're all I see

I wake from a dream
And see you by my side
How could I belong to someone else
When holdin' you feels so right?

And here in my heart
Where no one else will ever be
We've made it so far
So lock the door
And throw away the key, yeah

Save all your love
Save your love for me
When I'm alone at night
You're all I see

Save all your love
Save your love for me
Don't turn your back on me
You're all I need

I know who you are
We've come so far
So baby, stay with me, yeah

Save all your love
Save your love for me
When I'm alone at night
You're all I see

Save all your love
Save your love for me
Don't turn your back on me
You're all I need

Save all your love
Save your love
Save your love
Save all your love
Save, save all your love
Save your love
Baby, save all your love
Save all your love
