I'ma be honest
I'm not looking for love
I'm not looking for love
I'm just looking for some

I'ma be honest
No, I'm never at home
Said I'm never at home
I'm away from the road

So I can't be your everything
So you can keep your diamond ring
This queen don't need a king
Need a king, need a king

So I'll see you
When I cya
When I cya
When I cya

So I'll see you
When I cya
When I cya
When I cya

So I'll see you
When I cya
When I cya
When I cya

So I'll see you
When I cya
When I cya
When I cya

Let's make this clear
I like what you do
I like what you do
When it's me and you

But let's make this clear
It's when I got time (got time)
It's when I got time (got time)
So go live your life

So know you don't belong to me
Go out boy, and be free
When I'm back, I'll save you a seat
And then we'll meet, under the sheets

So I'll see you
When I cya
When I cya
When I cya
(It's how it's gotta be)
So I'll see you
When I cya
When I cya
When I cya
(So don't be mad at me)
So I'll see you
When I cya
When I cya
When I cya
(It's how it's gotta be)
So I'll see you
When I cya
When I cya
When I cya
(Sorry, baby)

It's how it's gotta be
So don't be mad at me
It's how it's gotta be
Sorry, baby

So know you don't belong to me
Go out boy, and be free
If it's true love, in time we'll see
But let it be, what it will be

So I'll see you
When I cya
When I cya
When I cya
(It's how it's gotta be)
So I'll see you
When I cya
When I cya
When I cya
(So don't be mad at me)
So I'll see you
When I cya
When I cya
When I cya
(It's how it's gotta be)
So I'll see you
When I cya
When I cya
When I cya
(Sorry, baby)

It's how it's gotta be
So don't be mad at me
It's how it's gotta be
Sorry, baby
