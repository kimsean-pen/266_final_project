I fall from the holy empire
An angel that loosing his path
I am tormented with passion and fire
I am tormented with pride, greed and lust

The raven
Once upon a midnight dreary
While I pondered, weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded, nearly napping
Suddenly there came a tapping

I am dreaming flying higher and higher
I am dreaming hope, fear, love and pain
My gracefull forbidden desire
They always call whisper my name

"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!
Prophet still, if bird or devil!
Whether Tempter sent
Or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore
Desolate yet all undaunted
On this desert land enchanted
On this home by Horror haunted
Tell me truly, I implore
Is there, is there balm in Gilead?
Tell me, tell me, I implore!
Quoth the Raven "Nevermore"

I fall from the holy empire
An angel that loosing his path
I am tormented with passion and fire
I am tormented with pride, greed and lust

Deep into that darkness peering
Long I stood there wondering, fearing, doubting
Dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
Be that word our sign of parting,
bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart

I fall from the holy empire
An angel that loosing his path
I am tormented with passion and fire
I am tormented with pride, greed and lust

And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifte
Nevermore!
