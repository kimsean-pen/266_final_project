I may be just a foolish dreamer
But I don't care
'Cause I know my happiness
Is waiting out there
Somewhere

I'm searching for that silver lining
Horizons that I've never seen
Oh, I'd like to take just a moment
And dream my dream
Oh dream my dream

Whoa, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind oh Lord, is fresh and clear
And I'd find the love that I long to see
Where everybody can be what they wanna be

Whoa, I like to greet the sun each mornin'
And walk amongst the stars at night
I'd like to know the taste of honey in my life
In my life

Well, I've shared so many pains
And I played so many games
Oh, but everyone finds the right way
Somehow, somewhere, someday

Whoa, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind can see fresh and clear
And I'll find the love that I long to see
People can be as what they wanna be

Whoa, I wish the world were truly happy
Living as one
I wish the world they call Freedom
Someday would come
Someday would come

Whoa, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind can see fresh and clear
And I'll find the love that I long to see
Everybody can be what they wanna be
Hey, hey hey hey hey baby
