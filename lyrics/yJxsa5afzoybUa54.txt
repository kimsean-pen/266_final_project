I know you
I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you
That look in your eyes is so familiar, a gleam

And I know it's true
That visions are seldom all they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream

But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream

I know you
I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you
That gleam in your eyes is so familiar, a gleam
And I know it's true
That visions are seldom all they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream
