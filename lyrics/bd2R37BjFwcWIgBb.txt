Mmmmm...
You open your heart, open your mind, let somebody in
Take a walk through your past
The good and the bad
Decide you can do this again
But it's supposed to feel different,
Supposed to feel safe,
Safe like goin' home
But just like sand it slips through your hand
Before ya know it your faith is gone
Every late night call
Every morning kiss
All the "I can't live without you"s
And you say goodbye like this
Don't you understand?
Do you even care?
If you loved me like you said you did
Well you'd still be standing here
You think you know somebody
It's all just a blurr
The nights are the worst
This bed still smells like you
Wake up from the dreams
Catch my breath
It takes everything I got to move
Yea it coulda been a long walk talk to fix this
The seas were gettin' rough but I thought we were worth it
Worth the trial
Worth the fight
Shows you what I know
Yea
Every late night call
Every morning kiss
All the "I can't live without you"s
And you say goodbye like this
Don't you understand?
Do you even care?
If you loved me like you said you did
Well you'd still be standing here
You think you know somebody
Yea-ey
Tell me where did you go when the lights came up?
I don't even know you anymore
Holding a knife if I could see things better
Yea you've done this before
Think you know, mmm
Yeah, you think you know somebody, mm.
You think you know, you think you know,
you think you know, you think you know.
Think you know, ohh.
Every late night call,
Every morning kiss,
All the "I can't live without you"s,
and you say goodbye like this.
Don't you understand?
Do you even care?
If you loved me like you said you did,
well, you'd still be standing here.
You think you know somebody, yeah.
You think you know somebody, yeah.

You think you know, you think you know,
You think you know somebody, yeah.
You think you know, you think you know,
You think you know somebody, yeah.

You never know, you never know
