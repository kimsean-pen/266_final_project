Hiding, sweet smile
In Victorian doorways
In tempestuous foreplay
Hiding, sweet smile
All the whites not gray
And clocks spark
Hiding, sweet smile
In Victorian doorways
In tempestuous foreplay
Hiding, sweet smile
All the whites not gray
And clocks spark
On the night of cake and kill
Where I took you by your skin
Indoors
A light spinning, we perform
And outside, left you again to your wife
Through Victorian doorways
Must be something else, must be something else
Our house, my heart and nightmares
Must be something else, must be something else
Hiding, sweet smile
In Victorian doorways
In tempestuous foreplay
Hiding, sweet smile
All the whites not gray
And clocks spark
Hiding, sweet smile
And your man is out of mind
And your man is out of mind
Hiding, sweet smile
In the madness of the mind
In the madness of the mind
