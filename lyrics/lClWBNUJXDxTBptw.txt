In a world so lost come and find me
We're on our own
You and I we'll chase the sunset
Down every road
Another million miles to go
Destination still unknown
Our happily ever after will be a story to be told
Headfirst, I'll take the dive
I'm not looking back
I've always been afraid of flights
But when I'm with you I feel like I can fly
You fill my lungs, baby when you get me high
And I don't ever wanna come back down from this tonight
We're not getting any younger
There's no need to be afraid
Say the word I'll take you there
Yeah we could run away
In a world so lost come and find me
We're on our own
You and I we'll chase the sunset
Down every road
Another million miles to go
Destination still unknown
Our happily ever after will be a story to be told
And I fantasize about your body pressed to mine
With sheets you drawn the line
And I'm on the other side
If I say it right
The perfect words the perfect time
A perfect world bound inside
A picture perfect state of mind
We're not getting any younger
There's no need to be afraid
Say the word I'll take you there
Yeah we could run away
In a world so lost come and find me
We're on our own
You and I we'll chase the sunset
Down every road
Another million miles to go
Destination still unknown
Our happily ever after will be a story to be told
Oh (I'll always wait for you)
Oh (I'll always wait for you)
All the way from the moon back to your living room
(I'll always wait for you) In a world so lost come and find me
We're on our own
You and I we'll chase the sunset
Down every road
In a world so lost come and find me
We're on our own
You and I we'll chase the sunset
Down every road
Another million miles to go
Destination still unknown
Our happily ever after will be a story to be told
Oh (I'll always wait for you)
Oh (I'll always wait for you)
All the way from the moon back to your living room
(I'll always wait for you)
