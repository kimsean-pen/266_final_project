Barely nineteen, I see you every night
Whispering "between us girls"
Oh, yeah, "between us girls"
"I don't think of him that often anymore"

Well, all the girls had long hair
And all the boys had long hair
And you were missing out

Once a week I keep an evening free for you
Does he teach you things?
Does he teach you things?
That you'd never do for me?
Well, I know what you mean

Well, all the girls had long hair
And all the boys had long hair
But you were missing out

Well, all the girls had long hair
And all the boys had long hair
But you were missing out

Well, all the girls had long hair
And all the boys had long hair
But you were missing out
