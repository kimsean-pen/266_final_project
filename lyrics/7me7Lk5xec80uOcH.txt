If it hurts this much
Then it must be love
And it's a lottery
I can't wait to draw your name
Oh, I'm trying to get to you
But time isn't on my side
If the truth's the worst I could do
Then I guess that I have lied
Keeping me awake
It's been like this now for days
My heart is out at sea
My head all over the place
I'm losing sense of time
And everything tastes the same
I'll be home in a day
I fear that's a month too late
That night I slept
On your side of the bed, so
It was ready when you got home
We're like noughts and crosses in that
Opposites always attract
You've taken me to the top
And let me fall back south
You've had me at the top of the poll
And then had me kissing the ground
We've heard and seen it all
No ones talked us out
The problems that have come
Haven't yet torn us down
Am I keeping you awake?
If I am, then just say
You can make your own decisions
You can make your own mistakes
I'll live and let die
All the promises you made
But if you lie another time
It'll be a lie that's too late
That night I slept
On your side of the bed, so
It was ready when you got home
We're like noughts and crosses in that
Opposites always attract
And you always have your way
For now it's too soon for you to say
Will we be always, always?
And you always have your way
For now it's too soon for you to say
Will we be always, always?
And you always have your way
For now it's too soon for you to say
Will we be always, always?
And you always have your way
For now it's too soon for you to say
Will we be always, always, always?
And you always have your way
For now it's too soon for you to say
Will we be always, always?
You've had your way, oh
You've had your way, oh
You've had your way, oh
