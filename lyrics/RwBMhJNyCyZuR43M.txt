Take your time now
Feel like standing still
Get your bearings
Until

When the day is through
All you got to do is slowdown
When the day is through
All you got to do is slowdown

Full of tension
'cause you love the chase
You just need your
Own space

When the day is through
All you got to do is slowdown
When the day is through
All you got to do is slowdown

When you've had enough
Of the faster stuff just slowdown
When you're sick from stress
Bust up in a mess slowdown

When the day is through
All you got to do is slowdown
When the day is through
All you got to do is slowdown

When it's hot up there
And you got no air, slowdown
You just need some time
To fall back in line
Slowdown down down down down down
