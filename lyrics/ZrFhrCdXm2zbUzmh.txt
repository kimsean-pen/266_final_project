Like a cat that's playing with a ball of twine that you call my heart
Oh but baby is it so hard to tell the two apart
and so slowly you unwind it 'til I fall apart

I don't mind waiting for your love for of time
I've got plenty of rain or shine
Please bring out your love make it shine like the stars above

Like a cat that's playing with a ball of twine that you call my heart
Oh, but baby is it so hard to tell the two apart
and so slowly you unwind it 'til I fall apart

I'm only living for the hour that I see your face
When that happens I don't wanna be no other place
'Til the end of time you'll be on my mind

I don't mind waiting for your love,
for of time I've got plenty of
Rain or shine please bring out your love,
make it shine like the stars above

I'm only living for the moment that I hear your voice
Oh, I'm waiting
I don't have any choice and the day is long
So won't you come where you should be

Like a cat that's playing with a ball of twine that you call my heart
Oh baby, is it so hard to tell the two apart
and so slowly you unwind it 'til I fall apart
