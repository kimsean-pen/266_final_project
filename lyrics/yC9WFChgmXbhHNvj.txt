Start tearing the old man down
Run past the heather and down to the old road
Start turning the grain into the ground
Roll a new leaf over
In the middle of the night
there's an old man
treading around
in the gathered rain
"Hey mister if you want to walk on water
Would you drop a line my way?"

Omaha
Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door

Start threading the needle
Brush past the shuttle
that slides through the cold room
Start turning the wool across the wire
Roll the new life over
In the middle of the night
there's an old man
threading his toes through a bucket of rain
"Hey mister if you want to walk on water
You're only going to walk all over me"

Omaha
Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door

Start running the banner down
Drop past the color come up through the summer rain
Start turning the girl into the ground
Roll a new life over
In the middle of the day
there's a young man
rolling around in the earth and rain
Hey mister if you're going to walk on water,
you know, you're only going to walk all over me

Omaha
Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door...

Omaha
Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door...

Oh, sweet Omaha,
Sunday morning, I'm coming home today
