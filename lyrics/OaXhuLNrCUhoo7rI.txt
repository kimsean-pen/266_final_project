Just let it go don't wanna argue anymore
I can't be sure I know just what are we fighting for
I know you're scared and that you're thinking I may go
I'm not leaving I'm not leaving

And if you're thinking I might
Might be led astray
Just remember this one question

What if I was nothing?
What if this is true?
What if I was nothing, girl?
Nothing without you
So, what if I was angry?
What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl
Nothing without you

I know it's hard it seems we've worked at this so long
It's often foolish pride that tells us we're not wrong
I hear your voice you tell me that you'll never go
And I believe it, I believe it

And if you're thinking I might
Might be led astray
Just remember this one question

What if I was nothing?
What if this is true?
What if I was nothing, girl?
Nothing without you
So, what if I was angry?
What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl
Nothing without you

We can keep this going on
We'll make it work some way
And every step it makes us stronger every day (every day)

And if you're thinking I might
Might be led astray (led astray)
Just remember this one question

What if I was nothing?
What if this is true?
What if I was nothing, girl?
Nothing without you
So, what if I was angry?
What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl
Nothing without you
What if I was nothing?
What if this is true?
What if I was nothing, girl?
Nothing without you
So, what if I was angry?
What did you think I'd do?
I told you that I love you, girl
Nothing without you
