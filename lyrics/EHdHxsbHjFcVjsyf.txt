The vicious beating, the rapid flow of thinning blood
Pumping fluid that warms the darkness of my heart
The heavy breathing, the strangest desire
The drive of evolution is designed not to be denied

No day is complete without the enjoyment of flesh
For the daily ritual is essential to the rhythm of strength and vitality
Do not deny yourself the pleasures of life
Resistance of nature is a painful way to go
Even the savage needs love to survive
Follow your instincts and let them run wild

We are beasts designed to feel
Rewarded with pleasure, and punished with oh so much pain
Universal, survival of the species is driven by natural technologies

The vicious beating, the rapid flow of thinning blood
Pumping fluid that warms the darkness of my heart
The heavy breathing, the strangest desire
