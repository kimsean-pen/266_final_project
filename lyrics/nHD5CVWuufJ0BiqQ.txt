Decided to sneak off away from your stomach and try your pulse
They captured what seemed all unknowing and candid but they suspected it
Was false

She's playful
The boring would warn you
Be careful of her brigade
In order to tame this relentless marauder move away from the parade

She was walking on the tables in the glasshouse
Endearingly bedraggled in the wind
Subtle in her method of seduction
Twenty little tragedies begin

And she would throw her feather-boa in the road
If she thought that it would set the scene
Unfittingly dipped into your companions
Enlightened them to make you seeth

There's affection to rent
The age of the understatement
Before the attraction ferments
Kiss me properly and pull me apart
My fingers scratch at my hair before my mind can get too reckless.
The idea of seeing you here is enough to make the sweat go cold.
