I have the music but I
I had to sit one out
Wasn't cried broken but my
My friends all had their doubts
I stood on shaking ground
My world turned upside-down
Was lost but now I've found
The rhythm again

So play that funky music
'Cause there ain't no way I'm going down

It ain't over (uh-uh)
Best days are yet to come
It ain't over (uh-uh)
'Til I'm back at number one
Was out but I ain't done
Got moves you've never seen (ain't over)
Face on the TV (ain't over)

I'm so much better than I
More better than before
Picked myself up and now I
I'm back out on the floor
Haven't stopped dancing yet
I still got grooves to get
'Til then I'm just gon' let my feelings away, yeah

So play that funky music
'Cause there ain't no way I'm going down

It ain't over (uh-uh)
Best days are yet to come
It ain't over (uh-uh)
'Til I'm back at number one
Was out but I ain't done
Got moves you've never seen (ain't over)
Face on the TV (ain't over)
('Til I'm back at number one)

It ain't over (uh-uh)
It ain't over (uh-uh)
It ain't over (uh-uh)
Ain't over, ain't over
'Til I'm back at number one

It ain't over (uh-uh)
Best days are yet to come
It ain't over (uh-uh)
'Til I'm back at number one
Was out but I ain't done
Got moves you've never seen (ain't over)
Face on the TV (ain't over)
('Til I'm back at number one)

It ain't over (uh-uh)
Best days are yet to come
It ain't over (uh-uh)
'Til I'm back at number one
Was out but I ain't done
Got moves you've never seen (ain't over)
Face on the TV (ain't over)
('Til I'm back at number one)
