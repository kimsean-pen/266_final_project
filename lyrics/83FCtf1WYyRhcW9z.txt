I still got your Nikes
Laying in my closet
Right there in the corner teasing me
I still got your Nikes
Laying in my closet
All they do is bring back memories

Hey what's up it's been too long
I still feel like we gave up too soon
You packed up all your things and walked
But you left something in my bedroom

And you, you treating me so cold
Like someone you don't know
And now, I can't just let you go
I've thought I let you know

I still got your Nikes
Laying in my closet
Right there in the corner teasing me
I still got your Nikes
Laying in my closet
All they do is bring back memories

No I can't get you outta my
Get you outta my head
I can just walk away
And erase the nights that we spent

Then I still got your Nikes
Laying in my closet
Right there in the corner teasing me

Wishing we could hit rewind, oh yeah
Before we said we needed some space
I wonder if I cross your mind
I should've left something
At your place, yeah

'Cause you, you treating me so cold
Like someone you don't know
And now, I can't just let you go
I've thought I let you know

I still got your Nikes
Laying in my closet
Right there in the corner teasing me
I still got your Nikes
Laying in my closet
All they do is bring back memories

No I can't get you outta my
Get you outta my head
I can just walk away
And erase the nights that we spent
When I still got your Nikes
Laying in my closet
Right there in the corner teasing me

Even though I know you're gone
Something keeps me holding on

Even though I know you're gone
Something keeps me holding on

Yeah, I still got your Nikes
Laying in my closet
Right there in the corner teasing me
I still got your Nikes
Laying in my closet
All they do is bring back memories

No I can't get you outta my
Get you outta my head
I can just walk away
And erase the nights that we spent

I still got your Nikes
Laying in my closet
Right there in the corner teasing me

Even though I know you're gone
Something keeps me holding on
Even though I know you're gone
Something keeps me holding on
