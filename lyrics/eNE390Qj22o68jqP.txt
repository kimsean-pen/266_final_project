I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around my faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go
And drive around my faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

I think I wanna change my altitude
I think I wanna change my oxygen
I think I wanna change my air, my atmosphere
I wanna recharge

I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around my faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

I think I need to change my altitude
I think I wanna change my oxygen
I think I wanna change my air, my atmosphere
I wanna recharge

Bigger and better
Bigger and better
Bigger and better
Bigger and better
Bigger, stronger
Drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go
