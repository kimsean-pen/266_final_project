Walk out before you make it worse on yourself
Now's not the time for that elegant laugh
Digress from the people once by your side, once by your side
But now that it's over, you have to pick up and start again, start again

Falling to earth and you're calling it out
You're burning yourself and your challenge to winter
Gotta clip the lines and move for yourself, just move for yourself, love
Now that it's over, you have to pick up and just watch your back
Watch your back

And close your eyes to us, fight fire
Trap doors to endless wisdom
Young lad, have we grown too tired longing to find?

Learned that in time, you want it to end
Your life at this temperature, life underwater
You gotta let these fools all trample themselves
They trample themselves just dying to enter
You're preaching to the choir so turn around, turn around

And close your eyes to us, fight fire
Trap doors to endless wisdom
Young lad, have we grown too tired longing to find?

And close your eyes to us, fight fire
Trap doors to endless wisdom
Young lad, have we grown too tired longing to find?
