Day Dreaming
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Look at my mind floating away)
He's the kind of guy that would say
"Hey baby let's get away let's go some place, huh?"
Where I don't care
He's the kind of guy that you give your everything
And trust your heart, share all of your love
Till death do you part
I want to be what he wants when he wants it
And whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feelin' love starved
I'll be there to feed him
I'm lovin' him alittle bit more each day
He turns me right on when I hear him say
(Hey baby let's get away, let's go somewhere far
Baby can we?)
Where I don't care
(Hey baby let's get away, let's go somewhere far
Baby can we?)
Where I don't care
I wanna be what he wants when he wants it
And whenever he needs it
When it comes to bein feelin' loved starved
I'll be there to feed him
Lovin' him alittle bit more each day
It turns me right on when I hear him say
(Hey baby let's get away) hooo (let's go somewhere far
Baby can we?)
Where I don't care
(Hey baby let's get away, let's go somewhere far
Baby can we?)
Where I don't care
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you) woooo
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Look at my mind floating away)
(Day dreaming... thinking of you)
(Day dreaming ...thinking of you)
(Day dreaming... daaaay dreeeeming)
