You and I together in our lives
Sacred ties would never fray
Then why can I let myself tell lies
And watch you die every day?

I think back to the times
When dreams were what mattered
Though talking youth naivete

You said you'd never let me down
But the horse stampedes and rages
In the name of desperation

Is it all just wasted time
Can you look at yourself
When you think of what
You left behind
Is it all just wasted time
Can you live with yourself
When you think of what
You've left behind

Paranoid delusions they haunt you
Where's my friend I used to know?
He's all alone, he's buried deep within
A carcass searching for a soul

Can you feel me inside
Your heart as it's bleeding
Why can't you believe
You can be loved

I hear you scream in agony
And the horse stampedes and rages
In the name of desperation

Is it all just wasted time
Can you look at yourself
When you think of what
You left behind
Is it all just wasted time
Can you live with yourself
When you think of what
You've left behind

You said you'd never let me down
But the horse stampedes and rages
In the name of desperation

Is it all just wasted time
Can you look at yourself
When you think of what
You left behind
Is it all just wasted time
Can you live with yourself
When you think of what
You've left behind

The sun will rise again
The earth will turn to sand
Creation's colors seem to fade to grey
And you'll see the silky hands of time
Will write your final rhyme
And end our memory

Oh, no!
I never thought you'd let it get this far, boy
Oh, I never thought
I never thought you'd let it get this far, boy
Oh, no!
I never thought
I never thought you'd let it get this far, boy
No!
I never thought you'd let it get this far, boy
