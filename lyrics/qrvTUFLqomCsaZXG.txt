Tay, tay, tay, tay, tay, tay
Take or leave us only please believe us
We ain't never gonna be respectable

It's our occupation, we're a dancing nation
We keep the pressure on every night
Explanations are complications
We don't need to know the where or why

Tay, tay, tay, tay, tay, tay

Taking chances, bold advances
Don't care if you think we're out of line
Conservation is interrogation
Get out of here, we just don't have the time

Tay, tay, tay, tay, tay, tay

Take or leave us, only please believe us
We ain't never gonna be respectable

Like us, hate us but you'll never change us
We ain't never gonna be respectable

Hesitation is just frustration
Give us the music and we're alright
On each occasion, for your information
We can look after ourselves alright

Tay, tay, tay, tay, tay, tay

Take or leave us, only please believe us

Recreation is our destination
