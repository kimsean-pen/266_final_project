Crack that whip and
Give the past the slip
Step on a crack
And break your momma's back
When a problem comes along
Before the cream sits out too long
When something's going wrong

Now whip it into shape
Shape it up, get straight
Go forward, move ahead
Try to detect it, it's not too late
To whip it, whip it good

Crack that whip
And give the past the slip
Step on a crack
And break your momma's back
When a good time turns around
You will never live it down
No one gets their way

Now whip it into shape
Shape it up, get straight
Go forward, move ahead
Try to detect it, it's not too late
To whip it, whip it good

I say whip it, whip it good
I say whip it, whip it good
I say whip it, whip it good
I say whip it, whip it good

Now whip it into shape
Shape it up, get straight
Go forward, move ahead
Try to detect it, it's not too late
To whip it, whip it good

I say whip it, whip it good
I say whip it, whip it good
