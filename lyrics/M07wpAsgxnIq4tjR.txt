Everything change & we'll all change again
Sun sheds the light as the life sheds its skin.
You kiss your wish to the heart of the world
Secrets are safe with, will not break the spell

Come on, lets go home.
Buried in your womb.
Sing a song of death,
Til' there's none left

Love comes close
But chooses to spare me
Death comes close
But ceases to take me
I want to twist, the knife a bit deeper
To siphon the love from the hearts I believed in
Look outside, world is exploding,
Stay inside, still never knowing.
Taking cover, with each other,
Sleeping off the century of hope.

Everydays changing will remain the same.
Silhouettes shy as rain rots the drain.
Everydays decay debases the dream,
The ghosts that will haunt you are not what they seem.
Still you say you're dead
To deprevity,
But that can't be true, 'cause I know you can hear me.

Love comes close
But chooses to spare me
Death comes close
But ceases to take me
I want to twist, the knife a bit deeper
To siphon the love from the hearts I believed in.
Look outside, world is exploding,
Stay inside, still never knowing.
Taking cover, with each other,
Sleeping off the century of hope.

Love comes close
But chooses to spare me
Death comes close
But ceases to take me
I want to twist, the knife a bit deeper
To siphon the love from the hearts I believed in.
Look outside, world is exploding,
Stay inside, still never knowing.
Taking cover, with each other,
Sleeping off the century of hope.
