Back and forth in the wrong direction
Without any one of you
There would be none of us
We said we won't let you down
That's why we're still here
Because of you we still have a reason
For believing in ourselves

We said, we said
Nothing would ever change
There's nothing that could breake us
But nothing stays the same
We owe your lives to you
Beacuse life can be forgiving
When you're living for yourself
It feels like I'm on the right path for a change
We owe it all to you

So throw your fist in the air if we were on the same page
Scream as loud as you can if you can't feel a thing
I feel nothing
Without you

We said these the dark days of our lives
But you shine a light on me to guide me through the dark
We owe our lives to you
How can you say this is not for me?
Let me live my life in the way I want it to be
If only you can see this through me eyes

Scream as loud as you can
But don't turn away
Giving up on everything is easier than you think
I'll never turn my back on you
You have become our legacy
You are the light that guides us through the dark days
You gave us hope, we thought it couldn't be saved
