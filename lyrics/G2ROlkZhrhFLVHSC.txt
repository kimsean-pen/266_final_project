Highly likely for disaster when time counts down
Forecast for a firery blast off exploring all alone
Take me dancing down town for an hour of your spare time
Hold me closely so I can read what is on your mind

Love you're not afraid of flying, are you?
See that treasure box, it's filled with gold
It's not too late, not too old and grey
It's not too late to feel this way

Oh, it's not too late to feel this way
Oh, it's not too late to feel this way
