Is it a crime?
For me to be feelin' this way
I'm goin' out of my mind
And there's no change from my runaway love

Is it a dream?
(Is it a dream?)
That I'm throwin' in the wishin' well
I'm losin' control
Body and soul
(Body and soul)
Standin' here waitin' for a train that may never come

I saw the signs, I'd read the book
I should have had a second look
But, boy you caught me dreamin'
And there were times you'd come around
And we'd agree just to be friends
Tell me who was foolin' who

Deep waters, I'm drownin' in
Deep waters, slowly drownin' in deeper
Deep waters, I'm drownin' in
Deep waters, slowly drownin' in deeper

What do I say?
(What can I say?)
Where words have failed me before
What do I do, when I'm feelin' so blue?
And there's no place, for me to run and hide

I saw the sun inside your smile
And wished for more than just a while
'Cause, boy you caught me dreamin'
A giant step into the dark
We threw caution to the wind
Tell me who was foolin' who

Deep waters, I'm drownin' in
Deep waters, slowly drownin' in deeper
Deep waters, I'm drownin' in
Deep waters, slowly drownin' in deeper

(I'm drownin')
(Deeper, deeper, deeper)
(I'm drownin' in deeper)

Oh, I saw the signs, I read the book
I should have had a second look
"Cause, boy you caught me dreamin'
And there were times you'd come around
And we'd agree just to be friends
Tell me who was foolin', foolin' who

Deep waters, I'm drownin' in
Deep waters, slowly drownin' in deeper
Deep waters, I'm drownin' in
Deep waters, slowly drownin' in deeper

Deep waters, I'm drownin' in
Deep waters, slowly drownin' in deeper
Deep waters, I'm drownin' in
Deep waters, slowly drownin' in deeper

(Deeper, deeper, deeper)
(I'm drownin' in deeper)
(Deeper, deeper, deeper)
(So deep is the water)
(Deeper, deeper, deeper)
(I'm drownin' in deeper)
(Deeper, deeper, deeper)
(So deep is the water)
(Deeper, deeper, deeper)
(I'm drownin' in deeper)
