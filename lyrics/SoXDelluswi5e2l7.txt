Eddie Grace's buick
Got four bullet holes in the side
Charley Delisle is sittin' at the top
Of an avocado tree
Mrs Storm will stab you with a steak knife
If you step on her lawn
I got a half a pack of lucky strikes man
So come along with me

Let's fill our pockets
With macadamia nuts
And go ever to Bobby Goodmanson's
And jump off the roof

Hilda plays strip poker
When her mama's across the street
Joey Navinsky says she put
Her tongue in his mouth
Dicky Faulkner's got a switchblade
And some gooseneck risers
That eucalyptus is a hunchback
There's a wind down from the south

So let me tie you up with kite string
I'll show you the scabs on my knee
Watch out for the broken glass
Put your shoes and socks on
And come along with me

Let's follow that fire truck
I think your house is burning down
Then go down to the hobo jungle
And kill some rattlesnakes with a trowel

And we'll break all the windows
In the old Anderson place
We'll steal a bunch of boysenberrys
And smear 'em on your face

I'll get a dollar from my mama's purse
Buy that skull and crossbones ring
And you can wear it round your neck
On an old piece of string

Then we'll spit on Ronnie Arnold
And flip him the bird
Slash the tires on the school bus
Now don't say a word

I'll take a rusty nail
Scratch your initials in my arm
I'll show you how to sneak up on the roof
Of the drugstore

I'll take the spokes from your wheelchair
And a magpie's wings
And I'll tie 'em to your shoulders
And your feet

I'll steal a hacksaw from my dad
Cut the braces off your legs
And we'll bury them tonight
Out in the cornfield

Just put a church key in your pocket
We'll hop that freight train in the hall
We'll slide all the way down the drain
To New Orleans in the fall
