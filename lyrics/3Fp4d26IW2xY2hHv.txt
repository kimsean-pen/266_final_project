Down under the night sky
I lay in wait
Praying to whoever will listen to me
I fashioned my own cross
Been crushed by its weight
There's no stronger message
Than dirt in your face

I've seen down the end of the road
I deal in a different story, oh
I will never let go again
I feel it in my bones (bones), bones (bones)
I feel it in my bones (bones), bones (bones)
I'll do this on my own, own, own, own
Bones, bones

They say the spirit's willing
But the flesh is always weak
I found everything I needed
Right beneath my skin, oh

I've seen down the end of the road
I deal in a different story, oh
I will never let go again
I feel it in my bones (bones), bones (bones)
I feel it in my bones (bones), bones (bones)
I'll do this on my own

We're all architects of our own private hell
No one can hurt us like we hurt ourselves

I've seen down the end of the road
I deal in a different story, oh
I will never let go again
I feel it in my bones (bones), bones (bones)
I feel it in my bones (bones), bones (bones)
I know I'm not alone, alone
Bones, bones
Alone, alone
Bones
