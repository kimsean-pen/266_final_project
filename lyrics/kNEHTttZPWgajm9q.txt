You never said goodbye
It left a void that's like no other
I know because it's true

A darkness hid inside
Another storm has scorned another
I know because of you

And now
I know the pressure you were under
Behind your eyes there lied a war
I never thought you'd be another
Another thought and I was up
Here in your finest hour
This is your finest hour

I won't forget that smile
It was contagious like no other
I know because it's true

I'll hold our precious time
Up to the sky, I'll miss you brother
I hope you know it's true

And now
I know the pressure you were under
Behind your eyes there lied a war
I never thought you'd be another
Another thought and I was up
Here in your finest hour
This is your finest hour
Here in your finest hour
This is your finest hour

And now
I know the pressure you were under
Behind your eyes there lied a war
I never thought you'd be another
Another thought and I was up
Here in your finest hour
This is your finest hour
Here in your finest hour
This is your finest hour
