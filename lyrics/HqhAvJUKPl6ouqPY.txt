Do you wanna live a life that's just ok?
Don't you wanna be somebody who can say
That you got the gold 'cause you went out and played
When you feel like holdin' back don't be afraid

I fucked up last night but it's okay
If I say some crazy shit don't mean that I'm on cocaine
I been climbing high tryna find a new mind state
Don't you know that you're something more than just ok

(Ok ok ok)
We just wanna feel, something more than ok
(Ok ok ok)
Ooh, you make me feel something more than ok

From time to time we fall but that's ok
When you get back up on your feet once again
You can separate the real from the fake
Then it's up to you if you wanna escape

I fucked up last night but it's okay
If I say some crazy shit don't mean that I'm on cocaine
I been climbing high tryna find a new mind state
Don't you know that you're something more than just ok

(Ok ok ok)
We just wanna feel, something more than ok
(Ok ok ok)
Ooh, you make me feel something more than ok

You're no psychic but you can read my mind
We both want it at the same time
Don't you waste, don't you waste no more time
Gonna be, gonna be alright
We're gonna be...

O-
We just wanna...

(Ok ok ok)
We just wanna feel, something more than ok
(Ok ok ok)
Ooh, you make me feel something more than ok

(Ok ok ok)
We just wanna feel, something more than ok
