Another Rise, Another Fall - miami horror
Oh we keep trying
To spend a little time on our own
Oh we can't hide it
We're sitting in a lavender grove
Another rise another fall
Another chance to lose it all
Another high another dawn
Another story to call my own
If you wanna stay in harmony
It doesn't matter to me
If you wanna go I'll make you know
We are the symphony
Oh we keep trying
To spend a little time on our own
Oh we can't hide it
We're sitting in a lavender grove
All these nights awake
If you wanna stay in harmony
It doesn't matter to me
If you wanna go I'll make you know
We are the symphony
If you wanna stay in harmony
If you wanna go I'll make you know
Say it's not that safe
I'll change I'll change
I'll change I'll change
I'll change I'll change
Another rise another fall
Another chance to lose it all
Another high another dawn
Another story to call my own
Oh we keep trying
To spend a little time on our own
Oh we can't hide it
We're sitting in a lavender
