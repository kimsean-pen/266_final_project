I'm chasing dreams
Changing history
And we could be
In my dreams

Oh I, I
Oh I wasted it again
And now there's nothing left
It never works, never works
Oh I burned every bridge to be burned
Thinking it would turn
It never does, never does

You really need me
In my dreams
But in reality
You don't even see me

Oh I, I
Oh I wasted it again
And now there's nothing left
It never works, never works
Oh I burned every bridge to be burned
Thinking it would turn
It never does, never does

When I see you I cry
When I see you I cry
When I see you I cry
When I see you I cry
