Really like it where I am
Don't wanna go
You don't have to tell me so
These feelings that I have
I don't wanna show
When my time's up then you'll know

I'm gonna go
I'm gonna go

Really like it where you're not
Really like it a lot
Guess I'm better off alone
I won't care where you are
Hope you're very far
If you get too close to where I am
I'm gonna go, gonna go, gonna go, gonna go

I'm gonna go

Take that dream right
To the west side

Don't wanna go
Really like it where I am
(Don't wanna go)
Really like it where I am
(Don't wanna go)
Really like it where I am
(Said I don't wanna go)
