What's the furthest place from here?
It hasn't been my day
For a couple years
What's a couple more?

And if I go, don't forget
The one good thing I almost did
I learned your name without words
I used my eyes, not my hands

What's the closest you can come
To an almost total wreck
And still walk away
All limbs intact?

And when I go, you'll be there
Crying out, begging me
I won't hear, I'll just go fast
Into this night on broken legs

A near miss or a close call
I keep a room at the hospital
I scratch my accidents into the wall

I couldn't wait to breathe your breath
I cut in line, I bled to death
I got to you, there was nothing left

What's the meanest you can be
To the one you claim to love
And still smile to all
Your new-found friends?

In the same confusing breath
You pull away and draw me in
I wanted you, you wanted more
I built this life and now it's mine

A near miss or a close call
I keep a room at the hospital
I scratch my accidents into the wall

I couldn't wait to breathe your breath
I cut in line, I bled to death
I got to you, there was nothing left

A near miss or a close call
I keep a room at the hospital
I scratch my accidents into the wall

I couldn't wait to breathe your breath
I cut in line, I bled to death
I got to you, there was nothing left

I got to you, there was nothing left
I got to you, there was nothing left
I got to you, there was nothing left
