Don't miss you when I'm alone
Don't see your face in places we used to go
Thought that I would feel nothing if I ever saw you standing
In front of me
Don't know why I feel a shiver
Thought that we had frozen over
Now it's burning me and it's hard to breathe

There must have been a crack in the ice
But I can't remember when I fell through
I don't know why we didn't survive 'cos we held on tight
Feelings I'd forgotten buried deep under water
Pull me down
I thought that I could kill it but this love won't drown

When I hear our favourite song, don't reminisce
Just close my eyes and sing along
You were lost and I was drifting
Thought that I could let the feeling wash over me
Tried to keep it altogether but my heart is beating faster
I can't believe you still get to me

There must have been a crack in the ice
But I can't remember when I fell through
I don't know why we didn't survive 'cos we held on tight
Feelings I'd forgotten buried deep under water
Pull me down
I thought that I could kill it but this love won't drown

If I just dive in
If I just dive in
Will I drown?
If I just dive in
Will I drown?

There must have been a crack in the ice
But I can't remember when I fell through
I don't know why we didn't survive 'cos we held on tight
Feelings I'd forgotten buried deep under water
Pull me down
I thought that I could kill it but this love won't drown
Feelings pulling me down
