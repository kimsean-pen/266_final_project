Giving confession in the back of a taxi cab
Sins in a paper bag
Swear I'd be a believer if you just came back
Between bar lights and battle scars
Everything fell apart, how'd we get so bad?
Now I'm burning up, breaking down
Throwing out all I had

I'd give away all my money for you
Give up my watch and my car keys too
But here at the bottom of the bottle
I got nothing left to lose
I could stay for one more drink
I could go home with the next girl I meet
But I'm watching him while he's touching you
And there's nothing I can do
Guess I'm happy for you, you, you, you...

Woke up next to a girl that I've never met
Kick drum beat in my head
She took off like a drag from a cigarette
I swear if you ever came back I could get out of bed
And get my shit together
But I guess I'll get back to sleep instead

I'd give away all my money for you
Give up my watch and my car keys too
But here at the bottom of the bottle
I got nothing left to lose
I could stay for one more drink
I could go home with the next girl I meet
But I'm watching him while he's touching you
And there's nothing I can do
Guess I'm happy for you, you, you, you...

When he walks you home he better damn know
You deserve everything
Maybe he's a better me
I hope you know just how amazing you are

I'd give away all my money for you
Give you my watch and my car keys too
But here at the bottom of the bottle
I got nothing left to lose

I'd give away all my money for you
Give up my watch and my car keys too
But here at the bottom of the bottle
I got nothing left to lose
I could stay for one more drink
I could go home with the next girl I meet
But I'm watching him while he's touching you
And there's nothing I can do
Guess I'm happy for you
