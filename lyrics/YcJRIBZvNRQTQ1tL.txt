I would've woke you up
But you're so far gone
At that point of the night, usually
Of the night, usually
Why'd you, see you could lie
Home so you could lie to me
About all of the shooting stars, that you see
Shooting stars that you see

'Cause you are so smart
I am so weak
Could you please explain to me
You stayed shallow, while I went too deep

I'm scared to be living by the ocean, living by the ocean
I'm scared to be living by the ocean
I'm scared to be living by the ocean
I'm scared to be living by the ocean

I fell to my knees
While the waves hit me like I was on the beach
This has nothing to do with you, it's me versus me
I designed this world, custom t-shirts, and everything
Maybe if I was on tour
Maybe if I was with the boys
But I'm not and I'm not
And it's not about you and me
It's about everybody else

You are so smart
I am so weak
Could you please explain to me
You stayed shallow, I went too deep

I'm scared to be living by the ocean, living by the ocean
I'm scared to be living by the ocean
I'm scared to be living by the ocean
I'm scared to be living by the ocean

I'm scared to be living by the ocean
I'm scared to be living by the ocean
I'm scared
