Today I'll write about my cat
Sittin' in my kitchen
Would you like that?
I know sometimes I'm a bore and moody at best
I can be a drag
I know I'm confused a lot
Two people, one command
Do what thou wilt with me
I know not what I am
Most often, I'm normal and hold you next to me
But some nights I'm under the spell of darker beings
Magic practitioner
Symbols I know as true
Turn my computer off
I jump on top of you
Reveal my inner self, the path is always back to you
So what's up
Do we have
Enough time
Between us
Because...
I saw you in a dark room coverin' your head
So you might be unaware that I came in through the back
I thought you knew me from the start and I that I was into bad things
I guess that I was wrong though, I'm sorry about that...
(Magic practitioner, I jump on top of you)
I tore through the fabric of love in four dimensions
In song I say your name in casting your ascension
Step through to other worlds, unknowing where it leads me to
Reveal my inner self, the path is always back to you
In secrets that tie us apart from everything...
High strangeness
