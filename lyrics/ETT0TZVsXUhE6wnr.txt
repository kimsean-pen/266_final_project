I try my best
But you keep
Messing me
Around

Inside my head
You took your place
Tied me
Down

How long am I
Supposed to look for you
To look for you around

How long am I
Supposed to search in my dreams
And never find

One step ahead
You always know
What I'm
About

Caught in your net
You hold me when
I can't
Deny

Lost and confused in this state that I'm used to
When nothing seems to fit
And I don't know where
I'm supposed to be

You show up to make a mess
Take away my distress
And you got me so easy, so easy that
I can't deny

How long am I
Supposed to look for you
To look for you around

How long am I
Supposed to search in my dreams
And never find

How long am I
Supposed to have you
In my mind
