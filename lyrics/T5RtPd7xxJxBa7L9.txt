The blackness
Keep, keep on
Never say die
Keep, keep on

The blackness
Keep, keep on
Never say die
Keep, keep on
Keep, keep on

The blackness
Never say die
Keep, keep, keep
Never say die
Keep, keep on

Never say die
The blackness
Keep, keep on
Never say die
Optimistic

When in the midst of sorrow
You can't see up when looking down
A brighter day tomorrow will bring

You hear the voice of reason
Telling you this can never be done
No matter how hard reality seems
Just hold on to your dreams, yeah

Don't give up and don't give in, although it seems you never win
You will always pass the test as long as you keep your head to the sky
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic

If things around you crumble
No, you don't have to stumble and fall
Keep pushing on and don't you look back

I know of storms and strive
Out of your album of life
Just think ahead and you'll be inspired
To reach higher and higher

You'll always do your best if you learn to never say never
You maybe down, but you're not out
That's when I felt lifted [Incomprehensible]

Don't give up and don't give in, although it seems you never win
You will always pass the test as long as you keep your head to the sky
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic

You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic

You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic

You can win, yes
Yeah
In your head
Be optimistic

You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic

You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic

You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic

You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic

Yeah
