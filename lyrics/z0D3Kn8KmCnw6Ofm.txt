Have you kissed the ground
In service of the needles
Forgotten face
Found tucked away
And vacuum black
This ghost has been with you
All along

My voice is lost, inherently violent
We already made our casket stand
Trust when you're dead
You wanted it so bad
You didn't see how fucked it was
All the pulses were a line
Anesthetize you waste away
In the city you wept a grave
Decay

Drilled to the chest
The amulet receives our
Forgotten face
And in its place
The mirror scar
Has grown
And lost its feel long ago

My voice is lost, inherently violent
We already made our casket stand
Trust when you're dead
You wanted it so bad
You didn't see how fucked it was
All the pulses were a line
Anesthetize you waste away
In the city you wept a grave
Decay

You disrupt the phase
We can speak in opposites
Intersected hands decay

(You're always on your knees on time, always on your way out)

The mirror starts to fade
We out wait the revenant
Intersected eyes
Decay
