As you dig another grave
You can count on my distinctive presence
We as one but still miles apart

Now as I wish you would kneel before me
As I am, as I transform
Stronger than anything
Stronger than hate

Built for war...
I accept the challenge, the triumph is near
Dismantled...
I truly am your enemy

Restless believer
Of everything you hear
Of everything you see

Still I long for you, my culprit of choice
Won't leave your side
Through every second, every distant little noise
I will be yours

Need no one to get me through
Slowly fading into fidelity
My enemy, my words are true
Let me lead your way

We are enemies in fidelity
Nothing more but all too real

We enter the night, a promise of war
We spill our blood but ask for more

Meant to soar...
I tend to rival as you make amends
To the core...
You know we were meant to be something more

Still I long for you, my culprit of choice
Won't leave your side
Through every second, every distant little noise
It makes no difference since we're already torn

Need no one to get me through
Slowly fading into fidelity
My enemy, my words are true
Let me lead your way

I'll roll the dice, you'll succumb
Your silent rage will make it run

Need no one to get me through
Slowly fading in fidelity
My enemy, my words are true
Let me lead your way
