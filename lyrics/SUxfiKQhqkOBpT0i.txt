I don't see my friends no more, at all
Ever since I let you go, you know

I'm drifting in the deep
Tryna find a way home
Driving through the streets
Nowhere I wanna go
Felt like all I need is how I had it before
Thought that I'd feel free,
but the freedom comes slow

Lately, I've been leaning on myself (Oh)
Lately, I don't need nobody else
Just trying not to feel the way I felt (Oh)
Lately, I've been leaning on myself
Leaning on myself

Lately I've been fine
I've been filling up my free time
Wasting all my money, playing in the sunshine

I'm drifting in the deep
Tryna find a way home
Driving through the streets
Nowhere I wanna go
Felt like all I need is how I had it before
Thought that I'd feel free
But the freedom comes slow
Lately, I've been leaning on myself (Oh)
Lately, I don't need nobody else
Just trying not to feel the way I felt (Oh)
Lately, I've been leaning on myself
Leaning on myself

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Lately, I've been leaning on myself (Oh, oh)
Lately, I don't need nobody else
Just trying not to feel the way I felt (Oh, oh)
Lately, I've been leaning on myself
Leaning on myself
