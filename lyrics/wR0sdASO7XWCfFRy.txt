Relief come soon
i don't regret
keeping words
you might forget
fell into you
blew me away
you never thought
i never gave
what you want from me
i wish we made
our own lines that do
not bend to stray
because of you
i don't expect
keeping signs
you never read
i'm into you
you don't see
you never thought
we will never be
i can't let go
you never left
you don't accept
what i dreamt
it's always you
unspoken ways
i never stopped
you never gave
what i want from you
i wish we made
our own lines that do
not bend or stray
