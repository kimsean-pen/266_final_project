I felt my heart rate begin to
Choke out the fucking noise like I was cursed
It felt like storms were directly overhead
And where I went it poured

And in a flash came the flood that washed over my eyes
Now I could see inside the room of the blind
I lost myself inside
And as I fell into the black I left my past to die

Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And watch the stars fall down
You'll put your head in my arms as we wonder
Is there anything we could've done?

Why not try to start a revolution?
And in the morning find a new sunrise?
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And watch the stars fall down
As our world ignites

What will we do? Will we sit back and watch?
I'm sick of apathy dictating how I think and how I talk
I'd like to know as I lay down to die
I still control the way I think, before they make up my mind

As I gaze up towards the sky
I feel lost in the world of the blinding lights
We all hope to reach these heights
But we're all so afraid of the fall

No one will take the fall
We're all so comfortable with living in our sheltered holes
No one will take the fall
But if we try, we could all change the world

Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And watch the stars fall down
You'll put your head in my arms as we wonder
Is there anything we could have done?

Why not try to start a revolution?
And in the morning find a new sunrise
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And watch the stars fall down
As our world ignites

We are gathered here today as brothers and sisters not bound by fate
But by the understanding that our survival lies only in harmony

We have only one life to live
And then we're cast in to the night
Will you carry the torch and be the keeper of the light?
Or will you let darkness fall?
Or will you let darkness fall!?

Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world

Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And watch the stars fall down
You'll put your head in my arms as we wonder
Is there anything?
Is there anything?
