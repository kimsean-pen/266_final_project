Get your fist up if you wanna do something
Make your mind up if you wanna do something

People screaming (oh my god!)
To believe in (oh my god!)
Hearts are beating (oh my god!)
Too many gods (oh my god!)

Put your fist up if you wanna do something
Make your mind up if you wanna do something

Earth is melting (oh my god!)
Waters leaded (oh my god!)
Medicated (oh my god!)
Too many frauds (oh my god!)

All the pressure (oh my god!)
Bigger better (oh my god!)
Deadly weather (oh my god!)
Can't ignore it (oh my god!)

Were on the mend
Where to begin?
We've got your soul in vices
The brave the bold the righteous

Put your fist up if you wanna do something
Make your mind up if you wanna do something

Earth is melting (oh my god!)
Waters leaded (oh my god!)
Medicated (oh my god!)
Too many frauds (oh my god!)

All the pressure (oh my god!)
Bigger better (oh my god!)
Deadly weather (oh my god!)
Can't ignore it (oh my god!)

Put your fist up if you wanna do something
Make your mind up if you wanna do something

Put your fist up if you wanna do something
Make your mind up if you wanna do something
