I'm pulling hairs tryna cope with this bullshit I'm faced with
How do I face this, a world rendered tasteless.
I can't believe what I'm seeing around me
This shit is astounding and you fucks can't seem to get enough.

You are fascinated with the old me
and I bet you hate it when we don't scream.
You are stuck in the past

and I'm not looking back

I didn't do it just to make you happy
I do it for the ones still clapping

You're stuck on the fence
and I'm over it.

I see you there with your hands up
I know it's real cause you're just like us
head high giving no fucks
we'll be the ones they hate.
I see you there with your hands up
I know it's real cause you're just like us
head high giving no fucks
we'll be the ones they hate.

The ones they hate
The ones they hate
The ones they hate

It's hard enough to keep it classy
and when you see me bet you don't speak.
Tell me you haven't changed
since the day you learned my name.

Some people they just can't be happy
No more questions so don't fucking ask me
You're stuck on the fence
I'M OVER IT

I see you there with your hands up
I know it's real cause you're just like us
head high giving no fucks

we'll be the ones they hate.
I see you there with your hands up
I know it's real cause you're just like us
head high giving no fucks
we'll be the ones they hate.

It's easy from the outside
You're fighting to get in
It's not all gold and glory
I gave my life for this
They never fail to judge me, no matter who I am
I can't change my story,
But I'll do the best I can.
But I'll do the best I can.
