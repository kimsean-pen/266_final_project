Like a flower, grows on intentionally towards the sun
I grow towards the one that hurts me most
And like a razor follows upon command
Follows a guiding hand that's made to push the blade

And I know that if I were to save the day
I know it's not my victory
I'll just sit here with my golden smile
And if you were to save the world
You know it's not a day for heroes
You just sit there with your empty eyes
And scarlet heart, and scarlet heart

Like the river, caught in a memory
Do you remember life before you shut the door on me?
And like whenever you want a safe return
I'll be here with open arms to keep you safe from harm

And I know that if you were to save the world
You know it's not a day for heroes
You just sit there with your empty eyes
And if we were to save the day
We know it's not our victory, no
We'll just sit here with our golden smiles
And scarlet heart, and scarlet heart

And the curtain falls for all
And the curtain falls for all

And the curtain falls for all
And the curtain falls for all
And the curtain falls for all

And the curtain falls for all
And the curtain falls for all

Like a flower, grows on intentionally towards the sun
I grow towards the one that hurts me most
