I was blown away
Busy disappearing 'till I saw your face
In the stratosphere and now
I can't escape
The force field that we're in, got me
Light years away
So out of space
Without a trace
Baby we're gone
Baby we're gone
Come on

Ain't no way were going home!
So lets stay on the run forever
Let's go, knowing that we know
and get strange with the stars together
We can do what you wanna do
But what you wanna do?
Maybe we could do better
Ain't no way were going home
Yeah, so let's go

Yeah, let's go

Burning air
You lit a fire feel like
Millionaires
Black top to tires, let's get
Outta here
And you make it brighter when we
Can't see the road
Where does this go
God only knows
But baby we're gone

Baby we're gone
Come on

Ain't no way were going home
So let's stay on the run forever
Let's go knowing that we know
and get strange with the stars together
We can do what you wanna do
But what you wanna do?
Baby, we could do better

Ain't no way we're going home
Yeah, so let's go
Yeah, let's go

I'm the light, you're the bomb put together
I'm the pop, you're the rocks put together
I'm the wright, you're the song put together
Yeah, together, yeah

Lightyears away

So outta space
Without a trace
Baby we're gone
Baby we're gone
Come on!

We can do what you wanna do
But what you wanna do?
Baby, we could do better!
Ain't no way were going home
Yeah so let's go
Yeah let's go
Ain't no way were going home
Let's stay on the run forever
Let's go knowing that we know
and get strange with the stars together
We can do what you wanna do
But what you wanna do
Baby, we could do better
Ain't no way were going home
Yeah so let's go
Yeah let's go
Ain't no way we're goin home
Yeah, so let's go
Yeah, let's go
