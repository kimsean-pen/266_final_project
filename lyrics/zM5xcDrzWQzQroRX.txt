Long ago wisemen were.
Walking through a desert over there.
They were running away from this world.

Long ago wisemen truly found.
That indeed our planet is round.
And there's no way to run away.

And they turned into stones.
Silent observers of the world.

It's time to gather stones.
It's time to figure out this world alone.
Catch this fire that's coming out of stones.

It's time to gather stones.
It's time to figure out this world alone.
Catch this fire that's coming out of stones.

Ever since time has passed.
Through the years, through the north and west.
They were looking at us out of the sand.

People were falling in love again.
People were fighting till the end.
And the wisemen were keeping the secret from us.

And they turned into stones.
Silent observers of the world.

It's time to gather stones.
It's time to figure out this world alone.
Catch this fire that's coming out of stones.

It's time to gather stones.
It's time to figure out this world alone.
Catch this fire that's coming out of stones.

It's time to gather stones.
It's time to figure out this world alone.
Catch this fire that's coming out of stones.
