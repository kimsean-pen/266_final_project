Running around I'm always looking out for you
My hearts a ping pong ball skipping in the sea of blue
Can't you tell that I'm trying not to break through
Sometimes feel like I'm still stuck in grade school

It's all right when you come home
I feel like I'm living in a catacomb
My mind ya ya what's wrong is wrong

I can't I don't want to let you come back to the place in the sun
Oh no I cannot forget you, come back to the place in the sun

Running around still looking out for you
On my streets I feel like I'm going through

It's all right when you come home
I feel like I'm living in a catacomb
My mind ya ya what's wrong is wrong
