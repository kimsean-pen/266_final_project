The sun, it hasn't set yet
It's just gone behind the hill
We take the waning minutes
And wonder how and if we will
Keep all of the lights off
It's bright enough for now
You mock my color blindness
But even I could tell

Are you? Am I?
You and I, we are the only heirs
You and I, we are the only heirs
Are you? Am I?
You and I, we are the only heirs
You and I, we are the only heirs

Behind the jungle backdrop
The orange and green and pink
The kind and smiling waitress asks what you need to drink
The pilot lets the wheel go
These things can fly themselves
The less you do, the better
When the wind begins to wail

Are you? Am I?
You and I, we are the only heirs
You and I, we are the only heirs
Are you? Am I?
You and I, we are the only heirs
You and I, we are the only heirs

You want a battle, look, you're leaning on the railing
I know it ends, I just don't wanna know the ending
Let's live alone together, far from everything
I hear him howling, I hear him howling
You want a battle, look, you're leaning on the railing
I know it ends, I just don't wanna know the ending
Let's live alone together, far from everything
I hear him howling, I hear him howling

Are you? Am I?
You and I, we are the only heirs
You and I, we are the only heirs
