Ease you're feet off in the sea
My darling, it's the place to be
Take your shoes off, curl your toes
And I will frame this moment in time
Troubles come and troubles go
The trouble that we've used to know
Will stay with us till we get old
Will stay with us till somebody decides to go
Decides to go

Soberly, without regret
I make another sandwich and I fill my face
I know that things have got to you
But what can I do?
Suddenly, without a warning
On a pale blue morning you decide your time is wearing thin
A conscious choice to let yourself go dangling
Hovering
It's an emergency
There's no more "wait and see"

Maybe if I shut my eves
Your trouble will be split between us
People come and people go
You're scouring everybodies face
For some small flicker of the truth
To what it is that you are going
Through my boy, I left you dry
The signs were clear
That you were not going anywhere
Anywhere
Save for a falling down
Save for a falling down

Anywhere
Save for a falling down
Everything's going wrong

Later on, as I walked home
The plough was showing and orion
I could see the house where you lived
I could see the house where you gave
All your time and sanity
To people, then you waited for the
People to acknowledge you
They spoke in turn
But their eyes would pass over you
Over you
Who's seeing you at all?
Who's seeing You at all?
