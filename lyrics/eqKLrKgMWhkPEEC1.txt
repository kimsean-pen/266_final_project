We have to stop the fire
But you're the one who lights it
Again and again and again and again

My lungs are both corrupted, nearly choked
And still I'm breathing through the smoke
But the box of matches in your backpack
Won't get emptier

We have to stop the fire
But you're the one who lights it
Again and again and again and again
Until it's over

I'm feeling like your opposite
Contrast, colorless and you know
It's not easy without you
I never thought it goes like that
Contrast, colorless and you know
It's not easy without you

Your bones are fully bent and nearly broke
And I should leave you on your own
But the sounds of cracking necks and backs
Still keep me coming home

We have to stop the fire
But I'm the one who lights it
Again and again and again and again
Until it's over I'll stay, 'cause

I'm feeling like your opposite
Contrast, colorless and you know
It's not easy without you
I never thought it goes like that
Contrast, colorless and you know
It's not easy without you

Back up against the wall
Down on my knees
I screwed it up, but now
It's way too late to leave

And you know, you know, oh

Back up against the wall
Down on my knees
I screwed it up, but now
It's way too late to leave
