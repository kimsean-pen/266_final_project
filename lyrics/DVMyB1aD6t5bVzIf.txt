The night was getting dark, and you could almost see
(The moon refuse to shine)
I'm waiting in the car like you were here with me
(Before the longest drive)

'Cause home is a long, long way to go (when you're alone)
Somewhere we get to sigh
And look up at the sky
I told the moon to never let me go

So shine on, shine on, harvest moon up in the sky
I've been hit with wonder since you caught my eye
Slow down, I just want to stay all night with you
So shine on, shine on, harvest moon
Shine on, shine on, harvest moon

Travelling a while on a quiet street
Wondering where my darling waits for me

'Cause home is a long, long way to go (with you)
So I begin to sigh
And look up at the sky
I told the moon to never let me go

So shine on, shine on, harvest moon up in the sky
I've been hit with wonder since you caught my eye
Slow down, I just want to stay all night with you
So shine on, shine on, harvest moon
Shine on, shine on, harvest moon (shine)
Shine on, shine on, harvest moon
