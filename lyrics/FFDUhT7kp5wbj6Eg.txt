After loosing every shelter
remorse will be the only gift of pride.
Is that all that you remember?
sometimes it's really too late to change your mind...
Fall is lying by the river,
the morning is sad as it has lost a friend.
so it's time to clean your eyes,
being a master of disguise,
No-one understands your tears and whispers...
Silence cuts dreams with its shears,
Life reminds me to forgive and survive
But all you left to me is my fear:
Solitude is a shield
and it's cold enough to freeze the tears I've cried.
Summer vanishes in a lie,
No one seems to feel the weather quickly changes:
Wind blows into my heart,
It blows into my cheeks
and you will find my tear
falling from your perfect sky, today.
