If shame had a face, I think it would kind of look like mine
If it had a home, would it be my eyes?
Would you believe me if I said I'm tired of this?
Well, here we go now one more time

I tried to climb your steps
I tried to chase you down
I tried to see how low I could get it down to the ground
I tried to earn my way
I tried to tame this mind
You better believe that I tried to beat this

So, when will this end, it goes on and on
Over and over and over again
Keep spinning around I know that it won't stop
'Till I step down from this for good

I never thought I'd end up here
I never thought I'd be standing where I am
I guess, I kind of thought it would be easier than this
I guess, I was wrong now one more time

'Cause I tried to climb your steps
I tried to chase you down
I tried to see how low I could get it down to the ground
I tried to earn my way
I tried to tame this mind
You better believe that I tried to beat this

So, when will this end, it goes on and on
Over and over and over again
Keep spinning around I know that it won't stop
'Till I step down from this

This is a sick cycle, yeah
Sick cycle carousel
This is a sick cycle, yeah

So, when will this end, it goes on and on
Over and over and over again
Keep spinning around I know that it won't stop
'Till I step down from this for good

When will this end, it goes on and on
And over and over and over again
Keep spinning around I know that it won't stop
'Till I step down from this for good
