Nobody knows
We know nobody cares what goes on in here
Behind this door
Nobody gets in until all's careful sure

Don't creep up behind us
You know where to find us, well, always around
Take away if you need us
Before you lead us astray

Don't care who we meet
We're orphans here on Easy Street and we feel real mean
Cruising on speed
We've got more than we'll ever need, ain't life sweet?

We won't turn your pay down
City Kids won't lay down, we don't call so cheap
Better get some more of that
City kids, we don't give that to you
Oh no, no!

Bombs go off tonight
Searing heat, blinding light, you like it, fine
Park the car and run
Dance all night, it was for fun

Why do we do it?
No-one can get through it, we know where to run
Hear what we're saying
Time that you were praying 'cause city kids time, won't be long
Won't be long
No, it won't be long!
