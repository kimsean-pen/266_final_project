I just want to feel
Seems like I'm holding on
Never know whats real
Until it's all gone

Does it hurt to know
I can't get out
Well I'm cursed in souls
All around

I know that these failures will not end
Never seen the bright side anywhere
Just when I think there's nowhere left to sink
I find that these failures are in my head
In my head

It's getting harder to see
The forest from the trees
And what I can't avoid
Keeps coming back to me
Complacent while I kill these empty thoughts
Stuck in a place that I swear I forgot

Does it hurt to know
I can't get out
Well I'm cursed in souls
All around

I know these failures will not end
Never seen the bright side anywhere
Just when I think there's nowhere left to sink
I find that these failures are in my head
In my head

Write me off is all that I know
Waisting words when I should just let go

Failures will not end
Failures will not end
I know these failures will not end
Never seen the bright side anywhere
Just when I think there's nowhere left to sink
I find that these failures are in my head
I know these failures will not end
Never seen the bright side anywhere
Just when I think there's nowhere left to sink
I find that these failures are in my head
