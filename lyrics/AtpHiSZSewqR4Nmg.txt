Every dead body that is not exterminated becomes one of them.
It gets up and kills! The people it kills get up and kill!
I was born a zombie
I'm a creep
From the sea
I was born a zombie
I'm a creep
By the sea
I've got an alternative
Let's get in that ol' whirly bird over there
Find us an island some place, get greased up
And spend what time we got left soaking up some sunshine!
How 'bout that?
