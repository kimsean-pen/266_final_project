Ooh

I got lost in a river
Floating with my back up to the sky
And it was all along a river with another side
I've been chasing something in my mind, oh yeah
And it was all along a river with another side
I am sure I have been here before
But you were by my side, boy

Something's in the water or in the air
That I inhale that makes me sick
And it was, it was all along a river with another side
Something's in the water or in the air
That I inhale that makes me sick
And it was and it was all along a river with another side
Ooh, ooh

I was so lost and I was alone and I was so lost
But I deserved it anyway, yeah
And it was- (all along a river with another side)
I'm a fool and I'm a fool and I'm a fool for you
And it was all along a river with another side
I have no control
I'm floating to no coast and
I'll be drowning soon

Something's in the water or in the air
That I inhale that makes me sick
And it was, it was all along a river with another side
Something's in the water or in the air
That I inhale that makes me sick
And it was and it was

I got lost in a river
I got lost in a river
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
