I don't wanna make this harder than I have to
This is how it has to be
There's so many things I want to say
But you just don't listen to me

I don't want to hurt you, you don't want to hurt me
I can't stand you and you can't stand me
We can't rearrange you can never change me
Say goodbye nothing I say could change your mind because

I can't stay, tomorrow I'll be on my way
So don't expect to find me sleeping in my bed
'Cause when you wake up
I won't be there, I won't be there

Everything I say you find a way to make it
Sound like I was born just yesterday
And everything you taught me doesn't mean a thing
So I'm going my way

I don't want to hurt you, you don't want to hurt me
I can't stand you and you can't stand me
We can't rearrange you can never change me
Say goodbye nothing I say could change your mind because

I can't stay, tomorrow I'll be on my way
So don't expect to find me sleeping in my bed
'Cause when you wake up
I won't be there

This is the last night that I spend at home
And it won't take too long for you to notice
Won't take long for you to find out
That I'm gone

I can't stay, tomorrow I'll be on my way
So don't expect to find me sleeping in my bed
'Cause when you wake up
I won't be there
I can't stay, tomorrow I'll be on my way
So don't expect to find me sleeping in my bed
'Cause when you wake up
I won't be there, yeah
I won't be there, I wont be there, I wont be there
