Who can ever tell the color of a soul
And the memories we keep from long ago?
Do we ever really know each other's past?
You can't go back to before
But tomorrow will bring even more
Like the tide's gonna turn you will know,
When it's cold
You're on your own but you're never alone
Shine, shine like the stars in the sky
Wipe your dust off your love, let it shine
So when nothing's ever really carved in stone
Remember that your heart is holding on
And when every second melts up in the past
Don't be afraid it will end
Only fear that it never began
Like the tide's gonna turn you will know,
When it's cold
You're on your own but you're never alone
Shine, shine like the stars in the sky
Wipe your dust off your love, let it shine
You can't go back to before
But tomorrow will bring even more...
Like the tide's gonna turn you will know,
When it's cold
You're on your own but you're never alone
Shine, shine like the stars in the sky
Let it shine
