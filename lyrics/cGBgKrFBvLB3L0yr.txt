Fragile mind- I need something to take me away
You and I, maybe we should run together
Apathy- I want something to make me hunger
The world is on fire so I think we should run together
We wouldn't have a care
We wouldn't have to change ourselves
We're running out of time
We're burning out and wasting our lives
I don't know how to feel
I don't know how to face my future
Growing up is tiring, living for now is all I can do

I don't understand these rules
I just wanna speak with my heart
I don't wanna tone it down
I just want to do what feels real

I just gotta tune it out
