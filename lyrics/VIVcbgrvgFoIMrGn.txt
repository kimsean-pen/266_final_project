if i see u tmrw
will the birds still singing like
the way they do
to greeting this morning

if i see u tmrw
will the ... softly like
the way they do
to wash my worries away

will the crickets(?) and the limbs(?)
will the fire flash go blinking
to the shimmery star

will u look at me
the way u did last night
when u were here
by my side
