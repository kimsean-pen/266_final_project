Place your dreams where they're meant to be
Name your price to be at ease
To comply is to lose our innocence
Now I am not so innocent

Life size ghosts
Have come rushing through the cracks
Life size ghosts
They have come to push you back

Cut your ties they have lived to die
Trace your hand round an untouched land
Or watch fortune's skill
As it becomes invisible
Now will you be invisible?
