We didn't need a story, we didn't need a real world
We just had to keep walking
And we became the stories, we became the places
We were the lights, the deserts, the faraway worlds
We were you before you even existed

I carry on, carry on, carry on
And after us the flood
Carry on, carry on, carry on

Our silver horn it leads the way
Banners of gold shine
In the cold, in the cold, in the cold
Footprints of snow
Blind from the road
Hail!

We carry on, carry on
Follow us, we are all one
Battles fought, deed is done
But silver hum runs dark and strong
Hand to the heart, lips to the horn
We can stand we can say we can be reborn
Hand on my breast, I'll keep you warm
Hail!
