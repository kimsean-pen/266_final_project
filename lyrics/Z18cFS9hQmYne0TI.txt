i'm in a state of shock
i'm creeping up and down your block
i'm looking into you
i'm trying to catch yr view
its not a quiet meditation
O, that ya know
darkness makes the night more cold
thats what we know-about me

satisfied wise child
creeping heart and frozen perfection
you could touch my hand
i'll drink a case of you
heavens not about yr reputation
ya that i know
forever means the night turns gold
thats what we know about you

its been quite a ride
with you my sweet here by my side
funny how the mountains slide
we're stepping across the great divide
our bodies vibrate so slowly
ya that we know
bound together heart and soul
thats what we know about us
