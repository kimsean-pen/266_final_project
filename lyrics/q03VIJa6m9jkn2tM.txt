One world, one federation, a million tribes
When will you find the courage to join the good fight?
Some of you think we're cruel and enraged
Some of you think that we're blind to the wars you wage

Ballots and bullets cannot debate what we know
Ballots and bullets cannot deface the truth we hold

And now that you are so prudent and aged
We see you never really cared for freedom and the rage
Must we lose all courage to gain some peace?
Must we lose all lust in times like these?

Ballots and bullets cannot replace what we've grown
Ballots and bullets cannot erase the lies you told

If we are ever to return
It will be in chains
If we are ever to overturn
It will be in vain

Ballots and bullets cannot debate what we know
Ballots and bullets cannot deface the truth we hold
Ballots and bullets cannot replace what we've grown
