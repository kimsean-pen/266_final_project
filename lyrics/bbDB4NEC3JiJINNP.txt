I'm scared of talkin' in my sleep most every night
In case my conscience has a change of heart
Suddenly decides to let her know the darkest secrets
I keep bottled up inside
Maybe it's time I found a better place to hide
Or just somebody to confide in, yeah

I was never holding on to
Anything more than a memory of you
'Cause every time you proved me wrong
I ended up drunk and afraid of what I've become
Undone, I should be ashamed for thinking I could save you
For thinking I could save ya, I'd never be your saviour

I must be broken 'cause I saw myself in you
And every fleeting fragile moment
That you somehow struggled through
'Cause even now I still find comfort in the corners of your mind
It's been killing me for years but somehow keeping me alive

I was never holding on to
Anything more than a memory of you
'Cause every time you proved me wrong
I ended up drunk and afraid of what I've become
Undone, I should be ashamed for thinking I could save you
For thinking I could save ya, I'd never be your saviour
I'd never be your saviour

And you say
If we talk about love
And if I'm so lovely
Then why don't you love me like I do?
If we talk about trust
But how can you trust me?
Is it just me? Oh

I was never holding on
Anything more than a memory of you
'Cause every time you proved me wrong
I ended up drunk and afraid of what I've become
Undone, I should be ashamed for thinking I could save you
For thinking I could save ya, I'd never be your saviour

(Become, I'm undone)
I'd never be your saviour
(Become undone)
