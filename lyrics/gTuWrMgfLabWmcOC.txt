A butterfly to a neon light
Drab things make a throat feel dry
Mesmerized by your smog filled sky
Stagnate midnights make you wanna take flight

Its a neverending line
Another ugly soul just goes to show
Your heart's so hollow

Feeling lonesome on a friendly street
A bunch of high [?] women who don't see me
Scattered souls under headless trees
It's just another contradiction to me

It's the end of a line
Another shit job
Another piss-stained room
Another tomb
Another city
Hardly make it to the other side
Just to find, it ain't so pretty
Its a neverending line
Another ugly soul just goes to show
Their hearts are hollow

Lots of skipping
(Across the [?])
Wet lips quiver
(Sleepless yawns)
Can't you find
(Jumping the shark)
Just take a lucky shot
(Shot in the dark)

Its a neverending line
Another shit job
Another piss-stained room
Another tomb
Another city
Finally made it to the other side
Just to find, it ain't so pretty
