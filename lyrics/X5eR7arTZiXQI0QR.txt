You showed me that
There's always something left to lose
You told me that
There's always other girls when it comes to you
If there's a problem with me
That I don't even see
Then I'm ready to fix it
'Cause in that photograph
You smile way more than you used to do

Now there's only memories
Two bucks in the closet
You left and your mother's
That you gave to me

Oh
Promises I never keep
And the lack of attention
When you should have had all of it
It's my fault

All the love you gave to me
You know I wasn't worth it
You should have kept all of it
It's my fault

You showed me that
Some things just aren't meant to be
At the bottom of a bottle
I hoped mistakes wouldn't follow me

What if I would have seen
That you tried everything?
Maybe I could have fixed it
Now your friends tell me that
You smile way more than you did with me

Now there's only memories
Two bucks in the closet
You left and your mother's
That you gave to me

Oh
Promises I never keep
And the lack of attention
When you should have had all of it
(Oh oh oh)
It's my fault

All the love you gave to me
You know I wasn't worth it
You should have kept all of it
(Oh oh oh)
It's my fault (It's my fault, It's my fault)
(Oh oh oh)
It's my fault (It's my fault, It's my fault)

I hope you're gonna find yourself
When you know where you belong
I hope you're gonna find yourself
When you know where you belong
It's my fault

I hope you're gonna find yourself
When you know where you belong
I hope you're gonna find yourself
When you know where you belong

Promises I never keep
And the lack of attention
When you should have had all of it
(Oh oh oh)
It's my fault (It's my fault, It's my fault)

All the love you gave to me
You know I wasn't worth it
You should have kept all of it
(Oh oh oh)
It's my fault

I hope you're gonna find yourself
When you know where you belong
I hope you're gonna find yourself
When you know where you belong
It's my fault

I hope you're gonna find yourself
When you know where you belong
I hope you're gonna find yourself
When you know where you belong
