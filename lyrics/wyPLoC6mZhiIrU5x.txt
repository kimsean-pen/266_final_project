Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You pull my strings and push my soul
You fool my heart with every note
You drop the beat and kiss my face
You make me move, then cut the base

And you work so hard to get me
Just to let me go
Yeah, you put me in the spotlight
Just to steal the show
And you try to take me home
Like you're DiMaggio, oh
It's such a joke

Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song, without the love?
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song, without the love?

Why are we acting like lovers?
We don't know each other
Even though we used to rule the world
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song? (a love song)
A love song, without the love

I'm so confused, it's getting old
You wear your ring, but leave me cold
You're beautiful, but cause me pain
You play my heart like it's a game

And you work so hard to get me
Just to let me go
Yeah, you put me in the spotlight
Just to steal the show
And you try to take me home
Like you're DiMaggio, oh, oh, oh
It's criminal

Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song, without the love?
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song, without the love?

Why are we acting like lovers?
We don't know each other
Even though we used to rule the world
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song? (a love song)
A love song, without the love

This is the bending for the break (the break)
When we forget the harmony
This is how water colors fade into destined memories

Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song, without the love?
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song?
What good is a love song, without the love?

Why are we acting like lovers?
We don't know each other
Even though we used to rule the world (used to rule the world)
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song? (a love)
A love song, without the love

Oh, oh
Without the love
Oh, oh
Without the love
Oh, oh
Without the love
Oh, oh
Without the love
