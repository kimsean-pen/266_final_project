Let 'em tell us stories
As we lie in the fields
And watch a bird soar above
Let 'em tell us of love and loss
How we'll live and how we'll die
'Cos they say he once was
Somebody with a black suit
And good shoes
And a perfect smile
It makes me wanna ask

Was it in the
Mad love
And the big fights
So was it in the
Small change
And the passing of days
Or was it in the
Getting up
And getting on
Or was it in the
Mad love
Or was it in the
Mad love
So was it in the
Mad love

And a big fights

Let 'em tell us stories
As we lie in the field
And watch the clouds pass above
Our paper burns and pictures fade
Only melody remains

Sure enough he laughs as if he knows
Makes me wanna ask

Was it in the
Mad love
And the fights
Or was it in the
Right words
At the right times

Was it in the
Giving up
And a moving on

No was it in the
Mad love
So was it in the
Mad love
So was it in the

Mad love
So was it in the

Little things
We all want

We all want
We all want

Was it in the
Mad love
And a big fights

So was it in the
Small change
And the passing of days
Or was it in the
Getting up
And a getting on

Or was it in the
Mad love
Or was it in the
Mad love
So was it in the
Mad love
So was it in the
Mad love
So was it in the
Mad love
And the big fights
