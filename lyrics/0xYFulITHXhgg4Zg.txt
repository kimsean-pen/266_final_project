I come up for air
But I still can't breathe
And I still can't see my hands in front of me
And I'd tell you if I dare
That I don't feel free
And I just can't be living a life that you cut out for me
I look up to the sky with salt in my eyes
And a pain in my chest
Holding me down as I'm washing away what you said
But I won't be holding my breath
Your love comes in waves
Don't you ever wonder what it feels like?
Under water feeling low
Until you see white
Never knowing if we're drifting away
Your love comes in waves
Your love comes in waves
I toss and I turn and I fall and I rise
It's sink or it's swim
Getting caught up in your riptide
And it's rising in the air
The tension speaks
My reflection sees
All that I had tried not to believe
I look up to the sky with tears in my eyes
And a pain in my chest
Beating the life from the only good thing I had left
But I won't be holding my breath
Your love comes in waves
Don't you ever wonder what it feels like?
Under water feeling low
Until you see white
Never knowing if we're drifting away
Your love comes in waves
Your love comes in waves
I toss and I turn and I fall and I rise
It's sink or it's swim
Getting caught up in your riptide
Getting caught up in your riptide
Feeling low until you see white
Getting caught up in your riptide
Your love comes in waves
Don't you ever wonder what it feels like?
Under water feeling low
Until you see white
Never knowing if we're drifting away
Your love comes in waves
Your love comes in waves
I toss and I turn and I fall and I rise
It's sink or it's swim
Getting caught up in your riptide
Getting caught up in your riptide
Getting caught up in your riptide
Getting caught up in your riptide
