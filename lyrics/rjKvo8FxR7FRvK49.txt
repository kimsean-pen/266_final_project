It's been ten long years since I smelled the witch.
I don't think she will ever go away.
Do you think that's her lurking over there?
In that shadow that has been cast by me?

Can you smell the witch?
The witch is still alive.
Can you smell the witch?
I see her dead eyes.
I wanted you to go away.
Can you smell the witch?
The witch will never go away.

Does she hide in that old corner over there?
Are you dead when you are made of straw?
Is she still in that old house? The lonely old house.
Far away from everyone else. Her smell was stron up there.

The first time I saw you.
I smelt you more than I could see you.
The smell won't go away.
Is this how fear smells?
Does fear smell like a witch?
Come on smell the witch.

Can you smell the witch?
Sneaking up behind.
Can you smell the witch?
Can you feel the fear?
I want to go far away.
Can you smell the witch?
The witch will never go away.
