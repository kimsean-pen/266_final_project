You don't know a thing about me
Is there something that you should know?
I can tell you what you want to hear
Let your inhibitions just go, go

No, you don't know what you will give up
No, you don't know what you will give up
You don't know what you want
It may take you years to find out
You don't know what you need
Something that may never come to you

Trust is something that comes easy
When you've never been a victim
Lies and promises and words are said
It's you're decision to accept them, I say

No, you don't know what you will give up
No, you don't know what you will give up
You don't know what you want
It may take you years to find out
You don't know what you need
Something that may never come to you, to you

No, you don't know what you will give up
No, you don't know what you will give up
You don't know what you want
It may take you years to find out
You don't know what you need
Something that may never come to you
Something that may never come to you

Something that may never come, may never come
May never come, may never come, may never come
Never come, never come to you
