In my good good morning
I'm up before the sun can bring,
Early morning, and everyone
Like a shining thing.

All my angels appear
Before my window saying
Good morning
In my good morning

In my good, good morning
I feel before my thoughts all spring.
Am I conscious or
Is this my unconscious being
No more like a dream than a
God before my conscious saying
Good morning in my good morning?

In my good, good morning
I'm up before the sun can bring,
Early morning, and Everyone like a shining thing.
No more like a dream, then a God before
My conscious saying
Good morning
In my good morning.
