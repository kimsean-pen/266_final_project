Don't your conscience ever bother you
everytime you hear my name
Tryin' to think of all that I've gone through
and hang your head in shame
Someone came along and took my place
then you gave me all the blame
You should go somewhere and hide your face
and hang your head in shame

When you said I was the only one
wanted just your little game
Now look back at all the harm you've done
and hang your head in shame

Think of how you broke my trusting heart
and hang your head in shame
