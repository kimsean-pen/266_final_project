Oh, you got me on a heavy rotation

Why do people always tell me I
Why do people always tell me I, I don't need friends
I don't need friends like him?

I feel too complicated for your life
I'm honestly sedated half the time
That's why I don't want friends
(Take me as something dumb or what?)
I don't want friends like him
(At least I get the things I want from you)

Oh, you got me on a heavy rotation
Oh, you got me on a heavy rotation
Oh, I'm never gonna have a solution
Why are people always so defensive
When I clearly do not have ammunition?

You got me on a–, you got me on a
You got me on a heavy rotation
You got me on a–, you got me on a
You got me on a heavy rotation
