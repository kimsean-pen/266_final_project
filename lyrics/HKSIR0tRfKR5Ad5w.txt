Oh, the fashion never lasts
Despite all my attention
Phasing in and out so fast
In every which direction
And we all like to look back
Just to say "What were we thinking?"
Tell me now, what's the new black?
Did it change while I was blinking?

I'm such a sucker for everything
I'm just a sucker for everything
I catch the bug, get sick, get well
Get sick, get well, get sick, get well
But I'll always go back to the simple things
My Stevie and Sting

Almost lost myself just trying
To be like somebody else
I can never get it right
Guess it's just something I can't help
Only left to tell you how
You should just let yourself express
Just as long as you don't think
Too far different from all the rest

I'm such a sucker for everything
I'm just a sucker for everything
I catch the bug, get sick, get well
Get sick, get well, get sick, get well
But I'll always go back to the simple things
My Stevie and Sting

Get sick, get well, get sick, get well, get sick, get well (I get sick, I get well)
Get sick, get well, get sick, get well, get sick, get well (Ooh)
Get sick, get well, get sick, get well, get sick, get well (I get sick, I get well)
Get sick, get well, get sick, get well, get sick, get well
Get sick, get well, get sick, get well, get sick, get well
Get well...

I'm such a sucker for everything
I'm just a sucker for everything
I catch the bug, get sick, get well
Get sick, get well, get sick, get well (Get sick, I get)
But I'll always go back to the simple things
My Stevie and Sting

Get sick, get well, get sick, get well, get sick, get well
Get sick, get well, get sick, get well, get sick, get well
Get sick, get well, get sick, get well, get sick, get well
Get well...
