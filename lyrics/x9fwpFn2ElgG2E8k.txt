From one moment to the next
Reading in the papers to know what's best
Sometimes you don't know yourself
Eating lots of vitamins for your health
From one moment to the next
Red negativity in the street
Maybe it's the dirt, maybe it's the heat
A baby on the bus might have needs so easy

Now I think it's alright we're together
Now I think that's alright yeah
Now I think it's the best you've ever played it
Now I think that's alright yeah
Now I think it's alright to feel inhuman
Now I think that's alright yeah
Now I think it's alright, we'll sing together
Now I think that's alright yeah

A running child's bloody with burning knees
A kid that stabs mommy flew in the trees
A camping child's happy with winter's freeze
A lucky child don't know how lucky she is

From one moment to the next
A thousand wasted book markers all depressed
The ins and outs of someone's chest
He'll only be a friend if he touches your breast
From one moment to the next
Shifting in the plates of what you ingest
From sugar teas to honey best
Bulimic vegetarian wins a contest

Now I think it's alright we're together
Now I think that's alright yeah
Now I think it's the best we've ever played it
Now I think that's alright yeah
Now I think it's alright to feel inhuman
Now I think that's alright yeah
Now I think it's alright, we'll sing together
Now I think that's alright yeah

A running child's bloody with burning knees
A kid that stabs mommy flew in the trees
A camping child's happy with winter's freeze
A lucky child don't know how lucky he is
