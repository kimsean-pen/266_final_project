The woman was a dream I had though rather hard to keep
For when my eyes were watching hers,
they closed, and I was still asleep
For when my hand was holding hers,
she whispered words and I awoke
And faintly bouncing around the room the echo of whomever spoke
I awoke and faintly bouncing round the room,
the echo of whomever spoke

The place I saw was far beneath the surface of the sea
My sight was poor but I was sure the sirens sang their songs for me
They dance above me as I sink I see them through a crystal haze
And in a sweet sound bouncing round the never ending coral maze

That time then and once again I'm bouncing around the room
