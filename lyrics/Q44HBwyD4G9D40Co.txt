Whoa Whoa ohh we are all we have tonite
the ones you can't control
have only one another to depend upon
displaced from society Outcast we are
we have nothing to live up to
Hey! loud fast music
Hey! sweat and dirt
Hey! sounds from man's soul
Hey! noise of battle
Hey! Black clouds of smoke
Hey! it's time to lose control
COME ON GET UP NOW
Vengeance with our fists
screaming in the air
Whoa ohhhh ohhhh We are all we have tonite
all these joys and sorrow
i gladly sadly bring
this music is all we got
the only place i need
is drinking here tonite
together with you all
Hey! loud fast music
Hey! sweat and dirt
Hey! sound's from man's soul
Hey! noise of battle
Hey! Black clouds of smoke
Hey! it's time to lose control
the only place i need
is drinking here with you
WE ARE ALL WE HAVE
this noise is all we got
so let me hear you sing
WE ARE ALL WE HAVE TONITE
Hey! loud fast music
Hey! sweat and dirt
Hey! songs from man's soul
Hey! the only songs we need
Whoa ohhhh ohhhh we are all we have tonite
