Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know, you all, where I stand

(Monday morning) here I am
Want you to know just if you can
(Tuesday evening) where I stand
(Wednesday morning) Tell myself a new day is rising
(Thursday evening) get on the rise
A new day is dawning
(Friday morning) here I am
(Saturday evening) want you to know just
Want you to know just where I stand

When the morning gathers the rainbow
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too
So to the rescue, here I am
Want you to know just if you can
Where I stand, know, know, know
Know, know, know, know, know

We'll lift our heads and give Jah praises
We'll lift our heads and give Jah praises

Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know, just if you can, where I
No, no, no, no where I stand

Tuesday evening skoopa doop skoop skoop
Wednesday morning skoopa doop skoop skoop
Thursday evening skoopa doop skoop skoop
Friday morning skoopa doop skoop skoop

Awake from your sleep and slumber
Today could bring your lucky number
