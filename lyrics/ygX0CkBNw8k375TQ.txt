It was a wild, wild dream, but
I was afraid to love you
The years went by
I was tracing your shape
Now it feels as though
I would tremble to touch you
All these years
I was typing your name

And suddenly you're
Not a smile on a screen
Suddenly I'm floating miles
Above a canyon in the sun
And heavy as
The riverbed beneath
Dry and crumbling at your feet

Oh, oh, oh

(At your feet)

Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm returning from a trip
Across her kindness
I'll be waiting in the courts
Of her highness
I could be counting all
The flutters of her eyelids
While I'm lost here in
The sound of her quiet

(Suddenly there you are)
And suddenly you're not
A smile on a screen
(Suddenly there you are)
Suddenly I'm floating miles
Above a canyon in the sun
(Suddenly there you are)
And heavy as the riverbed beneath
(Suddenly there I'll be)
Dry and crumbling at your feet

(At your feet)
(Your feet...)

And suddenly you're not
A smile on a screen
Suddenly I'm floating miles
Above a canyon in the sun
And heavy as the riverbed beneath
Dry and crumbling at your feet
