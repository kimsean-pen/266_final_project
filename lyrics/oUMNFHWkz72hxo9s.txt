At dead of night when strangers roam
...
the streets in search of anyone who'll take them home
...
I lie alone, the clock strikes three
...
and anyone who wanted to could contact me

...
At dead of night 'til break of day
...
endless thoughts and questions keep me awake
...
It's much too late
Where've you been?
Who've you seen?

You didn't phone when you said you would

Do you lie?
Do you try
to keep in touch? You know you could

I've tried to see your point of view
but could not hear or see

for jealousy
I never knew time pass so slow
...
I wish I'd never met you or that I could bear to let you go
...
At dead of night 'til break of day
...
endless thoughts and questions keep me awake
...
It's much too late
Where've you been?
Who've you seen?
You didn't phone when you said you would
Do you lie?
Do you try

to keep in touch? You know you could
I've tried to see your point of view
but could not hear or see

for jealousy
...
I never knew 'til I met you
...
