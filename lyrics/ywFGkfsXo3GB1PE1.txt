Reaching to my pocket, then I grab a couple crumbled tonics
We look like some crumbled donnies
Blunted out, then fussing something
Paranoia turn my stomach
H1 hummer rough and rugged
Desert camo truck to the front, insert my seat adjusted
100 miles per hour, bitch, I've seen my custom
To life in the fast lane nothing
And the motherfucking gas tank dumpin'
Ashes are laughin'
Fucking duckin' what comes from the Government
Peelin' out until the sunset
Eyes so low, look like a sunset

Grey9, bitch, I signed my life away
Grey9, bitch, I signed my life away
Grey9, bitch, I signed my life away
Grey9, bitch, I signed my life away (always!)

Back on my bullshit
Now i have to pay a bet
Put my foot on the fuckin' brakes
Silent for life, Yung Christ
All I got was a death wish and centerpiece of $uicide
Fuck this ego, fuck this rap
Easily execution
On my side
Homicide, homicide
But we used to all the time
We in the Benz off the benzos under pressure clinical
We in the Benz off the benzos under pressure clinical

$uicide
$uicide
Grey9, bitch, I signed my life away
Grey9, bitch, I signed my life away
Grey9, bitch, I signed my life away
Grey9, bitch, I signed my life away

We are tired of this new world
I don't want to be here
$uicide, $uicide my end
$uicide, $uicide my end

You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son
You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son
You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son
You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son

Half past dusk (fuck that)
Back from the dust, Cut Throat

Jump in the cut
Got about 20k and a gun (what?)

Every day I'm sober
Do I look like I give a fuck? (No)
Every day up every night (what?)
Bloody knife serving them DA

Ay, you ever had to dig your own grave?
Live your life with no name
Backwood full of dro mane, Okay
'96 Benz with that cocaine
propane tank
gas seeping all over the house
Let that tank blow
So glad I stayed home
Someone called the cops on the payphone
Flames all around me, man I hope they fucking drown me
Crown made of ashes, only way they fucking found me
Forget about me, only way you might not feel so lousy
Forget about me, on my own head out with the price, the bounty

You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son
You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son
You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son
You can feel the bullets from my steel son, steel son

In New Orleans,
there were many bizarre things I always saw
growing up here, especially in the graveyards
And as a child, I spent a lot of time in the graveyards
And as an adult, I spent a lot of time in the graveyards
But as a child, it was a regular week-end thing to do
I always needed to know why...
Sometimes my why's got me in trouble

For my last trick, got 'em thinking I'm cut out for this rap shit
Ay, you wanna keep going, or.?
Nah, that's it
$uicide I'm fucking screamin' from the rooftop
The only thing I ever did was mentioning ever since $lick
Burn me a CD of Lil Wayne, that shit probly still in my boombox
But nowadays I keep walking to an
establishment that selling myself on a fucking jukebox
If I wanted to cop a black countach
Rob that shit like 2 blocks and then smash in
the back of a new cop car now I think I'm on a two

Yeah, just get a bunch of face tats,
it's gonna be cool. SoundCloud that, SoundCloud that, SoundCloud that
Make sure ya'll
Ay man, cut that shit off, man. It suck man,
garbage, man. Sounds like a fucking generic 3-6, man
Fuck the $uicideboy$
Too dumb. Get the fuck outta here
Change the station, they fucking wack
They're way too fucking short. Get the fuck outta here

Yeah, still feel like I'm losing, ay
Me and kin still feel like we losing, ay
We still feel like we losing, ay
Losing, losing
I'm on the lean, yeah, the drank
I'm on them bars, blowing thing
I'm on a lot amphetamines
Got no time for sleep, lost in my thoughts
I don't know who a friend or who a enemy
Nurtured and disturbed, down from head to toe
Have feelings sometimes gotta let it go
Plenty of days, thought shit was over
Created a other movement, created other music
Still feel like I'm losing
