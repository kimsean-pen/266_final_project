Never thought a paper cut could hurt so good
Holding me together like a rubber band should
Slow down? Whatever
Watch out? I'll never
I'ma play golf with the big boys
Other people smoke it, I just spend my paper
Put it on my card and I'll just pay you later
Cool down? Whatever
You know I'll never know
I'ma play ball with the big boys
(I'ma play ball, I'ma play ball)

With you I could be lonely
I could be lonely and miserable too
And use Patron to clean the wound
With you I could be crazy, I could be crazy
Cause that's what people do
That's what people do
That's what people do

Fold it into an airplane cause I got too much
Call it optimistic but so what?
It's cold? Whatever
I've got my leather
So I can have ice with the big shots
(I can have ice, I can have ice)

With you I could be lonely
I could be lonely and miserable too
And use Patron to clean the wound
With you I could be crazy, I could be crazy
Cause that's what people do
That's what people do
That's what people do

I'd rather wipe my tears with Egyptian cotton
And I'd rather race my fears in an Aston Martin
I'd rather see the rain from my penthouse window
And I could be wrong, you could be right

But with you I could be lonely
I could be lonely and miserable too
And use Patron to clean the wound
With you I could be crazy, I could be crazy
Cause that's what people do
That's what people do
That's what people do
