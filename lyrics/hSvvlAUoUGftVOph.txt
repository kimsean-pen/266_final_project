I have only words to play with
Sing alongs in broken english
A malady from middle ages
I lost my accent in the plague

It's a murder mystery how my
Grapes all turned to cheap red wine
What was I to do with all this sorrow?
There's so much to be sad about these days

I have millions of opinions
I hope one day you'll hear me out
Under a pseudonym I'll write them
I can't be honest with myself

It's a murder mystery unsolved
But I heard it was laced with fentanyl
What am I to do with all this sorrow?
There's so much to be sad about these days

But the war ain't over, little toy soldier
This is the calm before the storm
You wanna raise hell with your dead friends
And burn the candle at both ends
The war ain't over, little toy soldier
This is the calm before the storm
Say goodbye to your dead friends
One day you'll see them all again

I have only words to play with
Sing alongs in broken english
A malady from middle ages
I lost my accent in the plague

The murder mystery's been solved
But it sure doesn't make any sense at all
What am I to do with all this sorrow?
There's so much to be sad about these days

But the war ain't over, little toy soldier
This is the calm before the storm
You wanna raise hell with your dead friends
And burn the candle at both ends
The war ain't over, little toy soldier
This is the calm before the storm
Say goodbye to your dead friends
One day you'll see them all again
