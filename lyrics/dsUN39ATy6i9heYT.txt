I want your attention in this room
Your eyes on mine
Sit you down, hop onto your pot of gold
You make me come alive

Swing it to the left, swing it to the right
Strutting on the stage, center of the lights
Trippin' smiles ain't coming down
Take your seat now

Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be wiling out on the low
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be wiling out on the low

We don't need crowds, we just need us
All my feelings are about to erupt
All my tricks, they're spectacular
My encore is immaculate

Swing it to the left, swing it to the right
Strutting on the stage, center of the lights
Trippin' smiles ain't coming down
Take your seat now

Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be wiling out on the low
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be wiling out on the low

Strut it out, strut it out, eyes on me (eyes on me)
Watch me strike a pose, feel my heat (feel my heat)
Spin it 'round, spin it' round, three-sixty
Ain't no boundaries here, no cameras, please
Ooh, ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh, so entertaining
Ooh, ooh

Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be wiling out on the low
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be wiling out on the low

Credits are closing now
Guess that's the end
Can we go again?
Can we do it all again?
Nah, I'll take a bow
Up, down, run it 'round
Tasting on my apple pie
Apple pie, satisfy
