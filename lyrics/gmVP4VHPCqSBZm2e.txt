In the summer time
As the clouds passed by
I call your name
Call your name

On the golden sky
Didn't have to try
To fall in love
Fall in love

Happens every time
By the rising tide
I fell down
What went wrong

Time passes by
As time passes by
I fall in love
More and more

I live for your love x4

In the summer time
As the clouds passed by
I call your name
It's all the same

On the golden sky
Didn't have to try
To fall in love
Fall in love

Happens every time
By the rising tide
I fell down
I fall down

Time passes by
As time passes by
I fall in love
More and more

I live for your love x4
