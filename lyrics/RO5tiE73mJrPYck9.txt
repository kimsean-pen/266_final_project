You watch their faces
You'll see the traces
Of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing
They leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind
Oh can penetrate your mind

But sail along, sing a song, carry on
'Cause we rock, we rock, we rock, we rock

We pray to someone
But when it's said and done
It's really all the same
With just a different name
So many voices
All giving choices
If we listen they will say
Oh we can find the way

But we'll sail along, sing a song, carry on
'Cause we rock, we rock, we rock, we rock
We rock, we rock, we rock, we rock
We rock

We rock

You watch their faces
You'll see the traces
Of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing
They leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind
Can penetrate your mind

Sail along, sing a song, carry on
'Cause we rock, we rock, we rock, we rock
We rock, we rock, we rock, we rock
Ride out, stand and shout, carry on
Sail along, sing a song, carry on
'Cause we rock, we rock, see how we rock, we rock
That's rock, we rock, we rock, we rock
