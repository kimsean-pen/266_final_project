Changes
All of these changes
But I'm here to tell you
Don't be afraid

Just like a sunrise
The light of a new day
Step out of the darkness
And let it show you the way

Nobody knows
Nobody cares
Whether you live or die in vain
Nobody knows
Nobody cares from where you came
Life's little game

Changes
All of these changes
Not making it easy
To say what I mean

But now I've got your love
Taking on my love
Filling the spaces
Left in between you and me

Nobody knows
Nobody cares
Whether you live or die in vain
Nobody knows
Nobody cares from where you came
Life's little game
