The sun is going down on me
As she surrenders to the sea
So steal the night and fly with me
I'm calling, I'm calling

The moon is high on me and you
Is my message breaking through
Darkened skies that once were blue
Are falling
(So hear me now)

Calling out your name
Burning on the flame
Playing the waiting game
In my calling
In my calling

(Forever and ever)

Through distant lands, through mountain streams
My river's running through your dreams
There's an ocean in between
Forever and ever

Chasing shadows through the years
I whisper softly to my dear
Be sure to know that I am here
Forever
So hear me now

Calling out your name
(A wish that could come true)
Burning on the flame
(I'm reaching out to you)
Playing the waiting game
In my calling
In my calling

Whispers in the air
(I dream you into life)
Hear a lover's prayer
(I pray for you tonight)
I can feel you there
In my calling
In my calling

No man is an island
That's an empty sin
Discovery is a journey
Just have to let me in

Calling out your name
(A wish that could come true)
Burning on the flame
(I'm reaching out to you)
Playing the waiting game

Calling out your name
(A wish that could come true)
Burning on the flame
(I'm reaching out to you)
Playing the waiting game

In my calling
In my calling

Whispers in the air
(I dream you into life)
Hear a lover's prayer
(I pray for you tonight)
I can feel you there
In my calling
In my calling

No man is an island
(A wish that could come true)
That's an empty sin
(I'm reaching out to you)
So steal the night and fly with me
I'm calling
Hear my calling
