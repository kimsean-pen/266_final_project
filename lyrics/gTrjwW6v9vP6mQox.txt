Yeah you got every guy in here
Spinnin' around spillin' their beer
I bet you came out to have a good time
So what you say you leave your friends with mine?
Yeah, they'll be alright, I just wanna see ya shine

Girl you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see ya do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see ya do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Woah, baby lets go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you parked on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see ya girl

Yeah, let me see ya girl

Whatcha think about takin' that chance
Takin' the ride, takin' my hand
Kickin' this crowd, ditchin' this club
This nights been waitin' on us

Make your best moves
Yeah 'til I get us where we're gettin' to

Girl you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see ya do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Woah, baby lets go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you parked on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see ya girl

I can see you gettin' my tailgate rockin'
Movin' your hips like wind moves cotton
You can get the whole wide country side hoppin'

Bring the beat back, oh come on with me girl

Girl you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see ya do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see ya do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Woah, baby lets go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you parked on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see ya girl
Yeah, let me see ya girl
Come on, come on, come on let me see ya girl
