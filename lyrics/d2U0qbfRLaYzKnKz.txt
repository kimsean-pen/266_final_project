I'm an alien from inner space
They can't read my mind all in my face
No one knows I'd rather spend my days alone on my pillow

I don't care what they say
I've been waiting for so long
Call me by my name
They keep telling me I'm wrong
We are not the same
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

I'm feeling high
My money's gone
Can't find my home
I wanna go
To my own private planet I've been dreaming of
Little moon in my head I be moving on
Up and away
Up and away

Just cos I'm born here
Don't mean I'm from here
I'm ready to run
And rocket to sun
I'm way up
I'm way up

Just cos I'm born here
Don't mean I'm from here
I'm ready to run
And rocket to sun
I'm way up
I'm way up

I'm an alien from inner space
They can't read my mind all in my face
No one knows I'd rather spend my days alone on my pillow

Earth's getting old
So color me gone
I'm ready to run
And rocket to sun
And it ain't so bad
So don't look so sad
Just cos I'm born here
Don't mean I'm from here

Just cos I'm born here
Don't mean I'm from here
I'm ready to run
And rocket to sun
I'm way up
I'm way up

Just cos I'm born here
Don't mean I'm from here
I'm ready to run
And rocket to sun
I'm way up
I'm way up
