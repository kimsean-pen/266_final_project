The bats are in the belfry, the dew is on the moor
Where are the arms that held me and pledged her love before, and pledged her love before?
And it's such a sad old feeling, all the fields are soft and green
It's memories that I'm stealing but you're innocent when you dream, when you dream
You're innocent when you dream, when you dream, you're innocent when you dream

I made a golden promise that we would never part
I gave my love a locket and then I broke her heart, and then I broke her heart
And it's such a sad old feeling, all the fields are soft and green
And it's memories that I'm stealing but you're innocent when you dream, when you dream
You're innocent when you dream, when you dream, you're innocent when you dream

We were running through the graveyard and we laughed my friends and I
We swore we'd be together until the day we died, until the day we died
And it's such a sad old feeling (Such a sad old feeling), all the fields are soft and green
And it's memories that I'm stealing but you're innocent when you dream, when you dream
You're innocent when you dream, when you dream, you're innocent when you dream
And it's such a sad old feeling, all the fields are soft and green
And it's memories that I'm stealing but you're innocent when you dream, when you dream
You're innocent when you dream, when you dream, you're innocent when you dream
