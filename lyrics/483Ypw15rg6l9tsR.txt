Those seducers, those seducers
Those seducers, those seducers

Bombed out lovers
Gallant red flocks of mellow seducers
Find eager seekers
Deep deef down
Beautiful lines from above and we're all a-glow
Raise her head and things get warm
Hold on to it's leg before it flies away
Sunlit walks
I feel no harm
My primitive words match my primitive heart
It's not as easy as it may seem
Remember that yourself is steam

And of course it don't mind
Chasing a bee inside a jar
And of course it don't mind
Chasing a bee inside a jar

Then like sheep led to sacrificial slaughter
They don't mind
But they oughta (they oughta)
All the time (they oughta)
Their pretty shells
Are so inviting
Well protected
Their eyes are rivers
They give me shivers

And of course it don't mind
Chasing a bee inside a jar
And of course it don't mind
Chasing a bee inside a jar
In a jar, in a jar, in a jar

It's not time for the real life sign
It's not time for these fears of mine
It's not time for the real life sign
It's not time for these fears of mine

I'm feeling troubled, I'm feeling trapped
Can't shake that bubble off my back

It's not as easy as it may seem
Remember that yourself is steam
It's not as easy as it may seem
Remember that yourself is steam

It's not time for the real life sign
It's not time for these fears of mine
I'm feeling troubled, I'm feeling trapped
Can't shake that bubble off my back
I feel no harm, I feel no harm
(feel no harm)

And of course it don't mind
Chasing a bee inside a jar
And of course it don't mind
Chasing a bee inside a jar
In a jar, in a jar, in a jar

It's not as easy as it may seem
Remember that yourself is steam

Well, once it's lost, it'll never be found
Keeps spinning in circles 'til you break the ground
