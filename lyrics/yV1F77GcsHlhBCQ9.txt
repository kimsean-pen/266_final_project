As if to say you're taken
Turns forever cause we're out of phase
So I've been harvesting the anxious thoughts of creatures you erase

God only sees it from both sides
Take a chance to clean his foggy eyes
Cause I won't seize up with a smile
Fake a nap to breathe in for a while

You only like me in my most peculiar state on Saturdays
But I can harvest all the soft delusions central to your game

God only sees it from both sides
Take a chance to clean his foggy eyes
Cause I won't seize up with a smile
Fake a nap to breathe in for a while

Up against the downfall
Flip the sordid shapes that will not go
One hand on the apple
One hand between the skin and the bone

We've got all the right words
You've got everything you need in tow
Tugging on the gaffer
Blame it on the ones we used to know

My foe and I
Believe in the hole
Keeping in mind
What lives down below

As if to say I'm sorry
Let me put the pieces back in place
And I will harvest all the anxious thoughts of creatures you deface
You want to know what I
Could only ever hide

It's only in your mind

Behind your foggy eyes
