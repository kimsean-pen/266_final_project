Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my love will take it slow
I hope she knows that I love her alone
I just don't know where the hell I belong

How optimism led me astray
Two hundred things I took the wrong way
But I saw her love gauge runnin' low
I tried to fill it, but it overflowed

Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my love will take it slow
I hope she knows that I love her alone
I just don't know where the hell I belong

She remembers my name
Could be blowin' way out
It's all goin' to change
She remembers my name

She's only messin' around
Please, no more playing with my heart
Ooh, go with Mr. Right just for once
(Then it all just came out)
No more mischief with my mind
(Guess I'll hold in, next time)

No more gettin' it wrong
I'll be frozen, here on
If forever, we'll see
No more guessin' for me

An' I was just so sure of everything
That's what you get for dreamin' aloud
(Then it all just came out)
(Guess I'll hold in, now on)
(If forever, we'll see)
(But no more guessing for me)
