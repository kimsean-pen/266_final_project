I will pray
I will pray
I will go down low
And I will pray to you
Down as low as I can go
I will go there and I will pray to you
I will beg you
I will beg you lord
I will deny myself
I will deny you lord
Though I've done nothing wrong
Never in my live
No no no no no
I will beg you lord
And I will pray for you to forgive me now
I will go down to the centre of the earth
And I will curl up in flames
And I will beg you lord
Take me in your cruel arms
Take me down home
And will say
"Come into me, lord, come in now
Come on in
Praise the lord!
Praise God!"
Come into my heart, sweet lord
Come into my heart
I am open
I am torn apart
I am naked
And I am impure
I am sexless
I am foul
I am ignorant
And I am hateful
Forgive me lord
Come in
Come on in
Praise God
Praise the lord
Praise god
Praise the lord
Forgive m
