"Who Cares?"
"I care."

This the best summer I ever had
I went to heaven no coming back
I hit the gym with a duffle bag, duffle bag
I hit ya girl with a ruffle bag, ruffle bag
Chips chips chips
All on my lips lips lips
Xoxo kiss kiss
Xoxo gossip, Jakey in a bitch
I put my state on the map like this
(What that shit sound like) SD
Me and my dick and his two best friends
(Run it back run it back) testes
I got the power to pull up
And hop out and pop out
And puke on the pavement
Fuck all the money I'm saving, man

I didn't even know I could feel, I could feel like this
Like this, like
Didn't even know I could pay my own bills like this
Like this, like
I didn't even know I could skip the honor roll like this
Like this like
Didn't even know I could talk to the dead like this
Like this, like this, fuck it up

That's my shit That's my shit That's my shit That's my shit
That's my shit That's my shit That's my shit (yo that's my shit)
Fuckin' a bitch Fuckin' a bitch
Fuckin' a bitch Fuckin' a bitch
Fuckin your bitch Fuckin your bitch
Fuckin your bitch and I'm Fuckin your bitch
That's my shit That's my shit That's my shit That's my shit
That's my shit That's my shit That's my shit (yo that's my shit)
Fuckin' a bitch Fuckin' a bitch
Fuckin' a bitch Fuckin' a bitch
Fuckin your bitch Fuckin your bitch
Fuckin your bitch and I'm Fuckin your bitch

I do this shit for my dead friends
Me and my brother we brethren
He the one that got me rappin
Captain and coke in the basket
I'm not 21 so I'm askin, I'm not 21 I ain't savage
I ain't tragic, I know magic
Leviosaa, my package (leviosaaaa)
The first girl I did it with killed herself
So now I gotta make sure I know myself
But I'm fine (ok)
It's fine (ok)
Had a BFF online (ok)
Hit up MSN all night (ok)
Gotta be kind rewind (ok)

But then I got DVDs
And then I got HDDs
But I'm still young Jakey
Sucked in by TV screens
I'm playin DKC
I'm playin Kirby's Dream
I'm living out my dreams
I'm living everything (music is my life!)
Imma do everything I can
Steal out of the house
Of my soul, snackin on
Graham cracker cereal bowls
Say what you want
Cause ya boy on a roll
Say what you want
Cause ya boy eatin rolls
Say what you want
You can say what you want
But you know that you wrong
When I bare out my soul
Lower the beat
In the burial hole
Bury me too cause
