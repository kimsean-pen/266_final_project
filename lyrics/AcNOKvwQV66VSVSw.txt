Let the water rise
Let the ground crack
Let me fall inside
Lying on my back
Lying on my back

Dry your smoke-stung eyes
So you can see the light
Staring at the sky
Watching stars collide
Watching stars

If you leave
When I go
Find me
In the shallows

If you leave
When I go
Find me
In the shallows

When the time comes
On the last day
When they start to come down
Will you just
Will you run away?
Will you run away?

And let it all rain down
From the blood stained clouds
Come out, come out, to the sea my love and just
Drown with me
Drown with me

If you leave
When I go
Find me
In the shallows

If you leave
When I go
Find me
In the shallows
In the shallows

Lying on my back
Lying on my back
Lying on my back

Watching stars collide
Watching stars collide
Watching stars collide
Watching stars collide
