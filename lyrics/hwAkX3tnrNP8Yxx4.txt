Tonight would be
The last night that we had our tea
That bloody tea
Which sent us into ecstasy
Yesterday Mother complained
Feeling dizzy, all in pain

Mother's getting weaker
Looking paler day by day

As morning came
She could not make it out of bed
And Grandma's spell
Was getting straight into her head
Not a single word
She didn't seem to be alive

Getting weaker
Looking paler day by day

Then Missy came in and she led me by the hand
I didn't want to go
Oh but I should have known
Mother was barely conscious
Why should I care?
Just looking forward to the next ordeal

I think I heard
My sister begging me to stay
She gave me the phone
So I could call someone for help
I simply let go of her hand
Then I cut the wire

Missy was crying
As I left them both behind
And Mother's getting weaker
Missy shouted at my back
"I hate You"
