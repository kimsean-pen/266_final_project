When the lights starts flashing
You can open up your eyes
And the highest mountain
Is the one that you have climbed

Yeah
I can look for love
'Till the skies ain't blue
I can look for love
To get over you
I can look for love
For a deeper kiss
Nothing ever felt
As good as this

Staring in your eyes
I see the sunrise
There's nowehere else but right here, right now
No deeper feeling, this is the real thing
There's nowehere else but right here, right now
There's nowhere else but right here, right now
There's nowhere else but right here, right now

It's a never ending
promise of the holy grail
But the space I'm in it feels so real
Gotta sit back and exhale
Yeah
I can look for love
Till the skies ain't blue
I can look for love
To get over you
I can look for love
For a deeper kiss
Nothing ever felt as good as this

Staring in your eyes
I see the sunrise
There's nowhere else but right here, right now
No deeper feeling
This is the real thing
There's nowhere else but right here, right now
There's nowhere else but right here, right now
There's nowhere else but right here, right now

'Cause the way you hold me tonight
Makes me feel like there's no other place I'd rather be
Than right here, right now tonight
Yeah, right here, right now tonight
There's nowhere else but right here, right now
There's nowhere else but right here, right now
