Look at the pictures
What do they say?
Will they help you through strictures
or just lead you astray?
Subdue your darkest secrets from behind,
as time is running out,
Admire its grace until you go blind

We could find our freedom
in the night, but every attempt is in vain
Dance away from my sight
Save yourself, remember to look away again
