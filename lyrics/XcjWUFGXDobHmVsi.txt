I open my eyes, watch you lying there
The sun breathing on your skin
It became an unwritten rule with you
Somehow I always seem to give in

Why you got to be so strong
Your stubbornness is proved
You know what I'd do for you
And I know where you'd walk for me
But we gotta speak it, oh, so quietly

If you could please just go away
Leave me alone, yeah, fly away
Into the stars, never see your face
It would make my world such a better place

If you could please just go away
Leave me alone, yeah, fly away
Into the stars, never see your face
It would make my world such a better place
If you could please go

You open your eyes, watch me lying there
Once I get to know what you see
Once I get to know what you feel, know what you think
If only I could step in your skin

But you see, I already know
It'll end in tears when you carry out all my fears
Being here's a dangerous game, I'll end up insane
And only have myself to blame

If you could please just go away
Leave me alone, yeah, fly away
Into the stars, never see your face
It would make my world such a better place

If you could please just go away
Leave me alone, yeah, fly away
Into the stars, never see your face
It would make my world such a better place
If you could please

I know that you care but it's never enough
I know you'll be there but it's never enough
Please just play fair, I don't ask you for love
'Cause I don't need no empty words here

I know that you care but it's never enough
I know you'll be there but it's never, never
Please just be fair, I don't ask you for love
'Cause I don't want your empty words here

If you could please just go away
Leave me alone, yeah, fly away
Into the stars, never see your face
It would make my world such a better place

If you could please just go away
Leave me alone, yeah, fly away
Into the stars, never see your face
It would make my world such a better place

If you could please just go away
Leave me alone, yeah, fly away
Into the stars, never see your face
It would make my world such a better place

If you could please just go away
Leave me alone, yeah, fly away
Into the stars, never see your face
It would make my world such a better place
If you could please just
