Up, up the feeling, this is revealing
Boy, I didn't know you cared
Must've been up on the weekend, in the club freakin'
Boy, I could see your stare

You were lookin' right at me, lookin' right back we
Knew there was something there
And I know you knew that if we did do this
It would be an affair

'Cos my man's at home, looking at the finger his ring goes on
He got trust in me, how am I gonna live with myself if I cheat

That'd be dumb, diggy diggy di dumb
Da don't want none
'Though I know it'd be fun to get some
Gotta run now, gotta go, gotta get home
'Cos my baby boy's on his own (twice)

Up on the dancefloor, then you go ask for
A night in with me
But you know that ain't gonna happen, I won't get trapped in
This, see it just ain't me

And you could try seduce me, but it's no use see
I'm in love with my baby
And I won't let you in, mess up and ruin
To do that I'd be crazy

'Cos my man's at home, looking at the finger his ring goes on
He got trust in me, how am I gonna live with myself if I cheat

That'd be dumb, diggy diggy di dumb
Da don't want none
'Though I know it'd be fun to get some
Gotta run now, gotta go, gotta get home
Cos my baby boy's on his own (twice)

There's no way I'm gonna play
I don't care what you gon say
Even tho' you make me crazy
I won't risk losin' my baby (twice)

That'd be dumb, diggy diggy
Da don't want none
'Though I know it'd be fun to get some
Gotta run now, gotta go, gotta get home
'Cos my baby boy's on his own (4x)
