Leaving with twilight though I was chosen
To wander the way in the dakest of nights
Oh, in the summer sun how soon I came to stray
A true damnation, when I turned away

So fell autumn rain, washed away all my pain
I feel brighter somehow, lighter somehow to breathe once again
So fell autumn rain, washed my sorrows away
With the sunset behind somehow I find the dreams are to stay
So fell autumn rain

Blinded by dawning so you would take me
Further away, away from the fall
Oh, you told me I must never dream again
A true damnation, you left me the pain

So fell autumn rain, but all things must pass

So fell autumn rain, washed away all my pain
I feel brighter somehow, lighter somehow to breathe once again
So fell autumn rain, washed my sorrows away
With the sunset behind somehow I find the dreams are to stay
So fell winter
