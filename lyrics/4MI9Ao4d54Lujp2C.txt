Wild, embroiled, young hearts depend on me.
While in style in darkened limousines
Young hearts remain unseen.

While you write your hiel of light,
(Do you need some company?)

Why do we need someone, really need someone?

Cardinal, you royal!
Young Gods remain unclean.
Royal is royal in thy xeno-scene
...Young hearts will still be clean.

While you write you trials of life,
(Do you need some company?)

Why do we need someone, really need someone?
