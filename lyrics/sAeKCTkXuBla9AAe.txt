Well I've been watching you like a hawk
A pack of vultures with talons drawn
Waiting for the spoil of my kill
Breaking everything I've built
Then you leave me here and wait for it to fall
You burn it down then you cut and run
With no regard to the damage done
And while they fell for everything
You were waiting in the wings
Picked them dry and bleach their bones in the sun

But now I'm on to you
And you can bet it won't be long
Before it's done to you
And your friends will all be gone

This is it
You're a con and your fraud's been exposed
You were caught, you're a cheat
Now you're chasing dreams alone
When you lie through your teeth
Every time that you speak
Lit the spark to mislead
I'm gonna call you out
Well I'm on to your game
Fuck your fortune and fame, I know

And you could never be me

Every dog has its day
I should've never let you crawl away, oh
Chalk it up to shell shock
But when the going got tough
You bitched out and walked away

This is it
You're a con and your fraud's been exposed
You were caught, you're a cheat
Now you're chasing dreams alone
When you lie through your teeth
Every time that you speak
Lit the spark to mislead
I'm gonna call you out
Well I'm on to your game
Fuck your fortune and fame, I know

And you could never be me
Walk a mile in my shoes
Down with you
Down with what you do

But now I'm on to you
And you can bet it won't be long
Before it's done to you
And your friends will all be gone

This is it
You're a con and your fraud's been exposed
You were caught, you're a cheat
Now you're chasing dreams all alone
When you lie through your teeth
Every time that you speak
Lit the spark to mislead
I'm gonna call you out
Well I'm on to your game
Fuck your fortune and fame, I know
