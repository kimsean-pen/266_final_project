Look around
There's nothing left to keep
By the bottles that broke you
From the solace you seek
Didn't know you were one in a million
Stuck inside the wall
I'm wondering how we ever got here
With no fear, we'd fall

Taking hold of our eyes
Beauty, a machine that's broken
Running on a million people trying
Don't cry, it's a wild time to be alive

Turn around it's time for you to slowly
Let these changes make you more holy and true
Otherwise, it just made it complicated for nothing
Warm and cold, a place for us too far

Living in the rising sun
Our life, a feeling that's moving
Running on a million people burning
Don't cry, it's a wild time to be alive

It already happened
Nothing you want to change more
Heaven found that life went down
Everyone's broken now and no one knows just how
We could have all gotten so far from truth

Love, pain, loving you
Everyone knows you just did what you had to
Burning much more than ever before
Burning down the door
It's a wild time to be alive
