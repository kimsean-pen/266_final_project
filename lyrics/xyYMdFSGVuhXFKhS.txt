Now how I could've loved you?
You know that I wanted all the time
I say there's no one above you,
But now there's a new bless above that line
Now how I could've known you?
Truth can never come without your smile
But I should've warned you
We live as long as I leave them all behind
And an innocent sigh, I wanted all of this to never subside
I never wanna miss a moment of life
Without your neck to kiss, I was thrown to the night
And now I know
Oh if you want it, guess you want it all baby
But once you got it you want something else
Even if you're holding out for something unchanging
Yeah, once you got it, you want something else
Oh if you want it, guess you want it all baby
But once you got it you want something else
Even if you're holding out for something unchanging
Yeah, once you got it, you want something else
Your shadow little touching
The surface reflected in your eyes
The whole world in a dark hue
Repeated without grace and broken lies
Now that I've known you
The truth could never come without your smile
But I should have warned you,
We live as long as I leave them all behind
And an innocent sigh, I wanted all of this to never subside
I never wanna miss a moment of life
Without your neck to kiss, I was thrown to the night
And now I know
Even when we get what we wanted
This heart's break will never stop longing
Pleasure repeats under no one
Even broken, my heart will go on
Oh if you want it, guess you want it all baby
But once you got it you want something else
Even if you're holding out for something unchanging
Yeah, once you got it, you want something else
Oh if you want it, guess you want it all baby
But once you got it you want something else
Even if you're holding out for something unchanging
Yeah, once you got it, you want something else
