Oh my lover, look what you've done
You've gone and took your love away
It seemed to me the only way out was run
Despite your trying to beg me to stay

It started as an honest attraction
Began under the guise of a flirt
Till you were screaming at the edge of the bed
"Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt!"

You said, "Come back baby, please don't go.
Come back baby, please don't go.
Come back baby, please don't go.
Come back baby, you hurt me so."

Wake me on the other side
You can hold you breath, I'll be dreaming she's easy
We can always say we tried
If we both come clean maybe then you can please me

Wake me on the other side
You can hold your breath as the thought of her drags us down
She cries like a baby
But she only learned to dream in sound

Oh my lover, the clock runs slow
Ever since the day you went away
And though I've tried a hundred ways to forget you
Still the emptiness is always the same

No matter who is laying beside me
All it does is make me wish it were you
And if I close my eyes tight I can almost pretend
And for a moment it's as if it were true

You said, "Come back baby, please don't go.
Come back baby, please don't go.
Come back baby, please don't go.
Come back baby, you hurt me so."

Wake me on the other side
You can hold you breath, I'll be dreaming she's easy
We can always say we tried
If we both come clean maybe then you can please me

Wake me on the other side
You can hold your breath as the thought of her drags us down
She cries like a baby
And she only learned to dream in sound

You can pin it all on me
The blame is mine to bear
With all the things I've done to you
We're far beyond repair

But still sometimes I think of us
And how things fell apart
And how you knew from the first kiss
That I would break your heart

Wake me on the other side
You can hold you breath, I'll be dreaming she's easy
We can always say we tried
If we both come clean maybe then you can please me

Wake me on the other side
You can hold your breath as the thought of her drags us down
She cries like a baby
But she only learned to dream in sound

Wake me on the other side
You can hold you breath, I'll be dreaming she's easy
We can always say we tried
If we both come clean maybe then you can please me

Wake me on the other side
You can hold your breath as the thought of her drags us down
She cries like a baby
But she only learned to dream in sound
