All the things she said she did
I can't believe they're done
Won't these white sheets swallow me up
I just feel so young
Wormed your way inside my head
To muddle up my brain
I'm glazed over, no-ones home
I'm going blank again
Chairs and tables move around
But I just stay the same
Everybody's happy now
The room has gone insane
You can't put the blame on me
I left before I came
I'm glazed over, no-one's home
I'm going blank again
