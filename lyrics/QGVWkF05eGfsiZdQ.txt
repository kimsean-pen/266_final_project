What's inside of the beast?
Tell me now what you need
To start your own execution
If I'm battered and torn
Strip it down to the core
Try to fight the redemption

We scream every single word
Begging for some retribution
You only feed on the weak
If it was all meant to be
Is that he only condition?

I pray it turns around
Something to believe
That pulls us to our knees
When all is lost, we find our will to let it go
If it's comfort that you need
Try and just believe you're unforgiven

Just admit it
Just admit it
Just admit it

From the day you're born
All you hear is the scorn
From your own institution
Wipe the dirt off your teeth
And try to say what you mean
To start your own revolution

We scream never to be heard
Cutting off the one solution
You only bring the disease
And strip away what you need
And hope that god will forgive us

I pray he comes around
Something to beieve
That pulls us to our knees
When all is lost
We find the will to live
And let it go
If it's comfort that you need
Try and just believe you're unforgiven

Just admit it
Just admit it
Just admit it

Sacrilegious
Do you believe?
(Do you believe?)
Watch the pieces
Fall

Hold us down
No one wins holy wars
Just tell me now I need to know

So please pul us to our knees
When all is lost
We find the will to live
And let it go
If it's comfort that you need
Try and just believe

Just admit it
Just admit it
Just admit it

If it's comfort that you need
Try and just believe you're -

I pray it turns around
I pray it turns around
I pray it turns around
I pray it turns around
