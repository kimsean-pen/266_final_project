Well, it's another warm day in the city of cold hearts
They all just play the part of who they are
And I'm here on my own, I'd rather be alone
Than try to be someone that I'm not

And you seem like someone who could
Appreciate the fact that I'm no ordinary man

And it's misunderstood what you've heard about me
I see why you would doubt me, but know this
No one has the right until they've fought my fight
To understand just where I'm coming from

And it's that fight that brought me here today
Exactly as I am no ordinary man

Well, it's another warm day in the city of cold hearts
It ends before it starts in their maze
But you, you're not like that, you know where it's at
The only rules you follow are your own

And you seem like someone who could
Appreciate the fact that I'm no ordinary man
