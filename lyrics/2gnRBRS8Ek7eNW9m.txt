Simple pleasures are the best
Simple pleasures are the best
Baby

Hugs and kisses, just keep em simple in search of us
Don't complicate something so easy
The sweet little things you do
You make a women feeling so good

Magical love is done when two hearts join as one
And what a masterpiece it can be
So hold me and don't let go, just let the feeling show
And baby, I'll give you all the love that you need

To love and be loved is what I dream of
Simple pleasures are the best, baby
Not asking for much, I'm just into sharing the love
Simple pleasures are the best, baby
Baby, yeah

Intimate talks, I like what you saying now
Holding his hands we stroll through park
Don't spend up a fortune to please me
Those wee little thing you do they're gonna keep me loving you

Magical love is done when two hearts join as one
And what a masterpiece it's gonna be
So hold me and don't let go, just let the feeling show
And baby, I'll give you all the love that you need

To love and be loved is what I dream of
Because simple pleasures are the best, baby
Not asking for much, I'm just into sharing good love
Simple pleasures are the best, baby
To love and be loved is what a woman and a man dreams of
And ooh, you are the best, baby
Not asking for much, I'm just into sharing all of your love
Simple pleasures are the best, baby

Keep it simple

Magic and love is done when two hearts join as one
And what a masterpiece they're gonna be
