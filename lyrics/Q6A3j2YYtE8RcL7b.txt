Lover, you want a war you want it sour
Lover, you want control you want the power
Lover, we used to live in harmony
Lover, you were my favorite company
A thousand lies I never knew
But the one I loved was always you
Now you're sleeping on your side
I can't believe it's true
Has it truly come to this?
.A broken love we couldn't fix
I'm divided in two, and left to wonder
I know you want to see me suffer
No, it isn't me, you love another
Oh, you know the cycle will repeat
Forever, never ending happily
Azure eyes I thought I knew
But the one you loved was always you
Now you're sleeping on your side
I can't believe it's true
Has it truly come to this?
.A broken love we couldn't fix
I'm divided in two, and left to wonder
Azure eyes I thought I knew
But the one you loved was always you
Singing softly in my womb
Pretending it's not true
Has it truly come to this?
.A broken love we couldn't fix
I'm divided in two, and left to wonder
