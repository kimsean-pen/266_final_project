See the same old crowd again
Wash my hands and shake my feet
And yes I missed you all
Since I last saw you I fell down the rabbit hole
As I wonder what we'd be like
Wrapped up so uptight with you
Lust will do funny things
I don't want you to go out looking so good
And you look so good

Rosie,
well I feel your love and I want you to agree to be
Still take your time
but get to me, Rosie...

She looked away as I mentioned my name
Street lights light up my shame
The world will take you and swallowed you whole
You're a big girl and I think that you already know
You've been bought and sold

Be careful with me
I see that all that you see
And Troy died in a day for little Rosie

Rosie,
well I feel your love and I want you to agree to be
Still take your time,
roll your stone to me, Rosie...

Gonna find you now I'll walk the beat
And you'll do me a pirouette in the street
And although we'll fall we'll find our feet
Rosie
Oh well I wanted you so easily
Illusions past and now I see
An image is so different to reality
Rosie...
Oh Ro-Rosie
