Found these in a box at the bus stop
My name's at the bottom
But I'm nowhere to be found
I really get around they say.

So I take these sightless creatures home
And I fear them so to tremble
For I'm no mother, I
Just some random defender

I remember runnin' chest-high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man
When we got along

I remember runnin' chest-high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man
When we got along

We raced along the ground
I chased it out of town
The sun's the meanest easy target that i know.

We played a tender game
Of "kissing cobra tag"
We slept astride our horses
Tied fast in their manes

My friend would touch my face
And leave a star or two
The years left constellations
Of our wild language

What drove the sun away?
I'm far to small to know
A gaslight's winter
Marches on refinery legs.

And what can i tell you now?
It sped away along the canal
And drummed mosquito clouds
From their dens of hot tires
For miles.

I remember runnin' chest-high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man

I remember runnin' chest-high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man
When we got along

Oh, petroleum
You're the top predator now
Soverign, lover, liar.
But you're uninspired too
According to your anthem, you.

Oh, petroleum
You're the top predator now
And I am just desire

Yes, one dirty diamond
Some random defender
I sold my flesh that I might die
So the world will spin
And my cubs won't cry
I have to be the sun for them
Oh, petroleum.
You are beautiful
But so am I

I'm a dirty diamond lying looking at the sky
I'm a dirty diamond lying looking at the sky
