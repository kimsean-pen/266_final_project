I was walking through icy streams
That took my breath away
Moving slowly through westward
Water over glacial plains
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

And now breathe deep, I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in-between
Leave me be, I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in-between

Hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo
Hoo-hoo hoo
You and I, there's air in-between
Hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo
Hoo-hoo hoo

Cut my hair so I could rock back and
Forth without thinking of you
Learn to talk and say whatever I wanted to
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

And now breathe deep, I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in-between
Leave me be, I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in-between

Hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo
Hoo-hoo hoo
Hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo
Hoo-hoo hoo
Hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo
Hoo-hoo hoo
You and I, there's air in-between
Hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo-hoo hoo
Hoo-hoo hoo
You and I, there's air in-between
