I don't mean to be so insolent
But you know it's cause I love ya
The foundation of my malevolence
You know I'd never hurt you babe
Sometimes I might get edgy
But a man can sometimes be that way
Nobody's perfect baby
And I'll always love you anyway

Ohh, Gabrielle
The sun is shining in your eyes
Ohh, Gabrielle
I didn't mean to make you cry
Ohh, my sweet baby doll
I put you above everything
Ohh, Gabrielle
I love you till the day I die

Sometimes I feel like my old man
You know that's hard for me to say
And sometimes I just lose my head
Don't know why I get that way
I want to keep you happy darling
It could only work out that way
Nobody's perfect baby
And I'll always love you anyway

Ohh, Gabrielle
The sun is shining in your eyes
Ohh, Gabrielle
I didn't mean to make you cry
Ohh, my sweet baby doll
I put you above everything
Ohh, Gabrielle
I love you till the day I die

Gabrielle

Oh, my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my...

Gabrielle

Well, Gabrielle
You know I love you baby
Do nothing to hurt you baby
But you know I got to love you anyway
Oh, Gabrielle, you're so nice
You know I- I love you baby
Oh, my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my...

Ohh, Gabrielle
The sun is shining in your eyes
Ohh, Gabrielle
I didn't mean to make you cry
Ohh, my sweet baby doll
I put you above everything
Ohh, Gabrielle
I love you till the day I die

Gabrielle
