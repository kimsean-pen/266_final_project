You're too much, I can't take it
You always seem to make my heart stop and
I can tell that there's something in your eyes
Calling me

I want you now, I want you all over me
Can't you tell me all your secrets?
I'll tell you all mine
I'll tell you all mine

Saw you all alone on the outside
I knew your move
Do you remember me
The same way I do you?

I want you, open wide
Can't you tell me all your secrets?
I'll tell you all mine
I'll tell you all mine

So good
You're so good
So good
You're so good
So good
So good
You're so good
So good

Going out of my mind
I'm handling it
Going out of my mind
I'm handling it
You're good, you're good, you're good
I'm handling it
So good, so good, so good
I'm handling it
You're good, you're good, you're good
I'm handling it
So good, so good, so good
I'm handling it
