I'm dreaming of sleeping next to you
I'm feeling like a lost little boy in a brand new town
I'm counting my sheep and
each one that passes is another dream to ashes and they all fall down

And as I lay me down tonight
I close my eyes, what a beautiful sight

I'm sleeping to dream about you
I'm so damn tired of having to live without you
But I, I don't mind
I'm sleeping to dream about you, I'm so tired
Oh, yes I am

I found myself in the riches your eyes, your lips, your hair
you were everywhere, out there
But I woke up in the ditches
I hit the light and I thought you might be here
but you were nowhere
Oh, love, you were nowhere at home

And as I lay me back to sleep
This love I pray that I can keep

Sleeping to dream about you
I'm so damn tired of having to live without you
But I, I don't mind
I'm sleeping to dream about you,
I'm so tired

This is just a little a lullaby
to keep myself from crying myself
A little lullaby to keep, keep
My eyes from always crying
This is just a little lullaby
I'm trying to keep myself from fall asleep, sleep
It's just a little lullaby
So I don't cry myself to sleep at night

Sleeping to dream about you
I'm so damn tired of having to live without you
But I, I don't mind
I'm sleeping to dream about you, I'm so tired
I'm so tired
I'm so tired
