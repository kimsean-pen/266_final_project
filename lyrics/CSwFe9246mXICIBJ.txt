The summer wind
Came blowing in
From across the sea
It lingered there

So warm and fair
To walk with me
All summer long
We sang a song

And strolled on golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind

Like painted kites
Those days and nights
Went flyin' by
The world was new
Beneath a blue
Umbrella sky

Then softer than
A piper man
One day it called to you
And I lost you
To the summer wind

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
Have come and gone
And still the days

Those lonely days
Go on and on
And guess who sighs her lullabies
Through nights that never end?

My fickle friend
The summer wind

The summer wind
