Took a trip on a houseboat
It was fun, you and me
I know you're really in love with him
Are you up to your knees?

Oh I'm always in decline
Always changing my lines
Always changing my mind
To be a friend is fine

I won't go sinking this houseboat
It's so hard to believe
He made you smile so easy
So make a smile for me

Will I always be denied
I thought about it last night
Could we baby, honey try
To put it right this time?

Oh how I've wanted to change
Let you take me home, let you rearrange
To find opportunity you should give yourself to me
You should give yourself to me

Oh how I've wanted to change
Let you take me home, let you rearrange
To find opportunity you should give yourself to me
You should give yourself to me
