Down from the ceiling leaks a great noise
It drips on my head through a hole in the roof
Behind these two hills here there's a pool
And when I'm swimming in through a tunnel
I shut my eyes inside the cupboard
I make sounds and through the tubes I send this noise
Behind these two hill here I fall asleep
And when I'm floating green grass of tunnel
It flows back down from the ceiling, leaks a great noise
It drips on my head through a hole in the roof
Behind these two hills here there's a pool
And when I'm swimming in through a tunnel I shut my eyes
