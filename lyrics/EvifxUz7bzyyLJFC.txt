Drift in space
Moves in circles 'round the Sun
Rising flame
Fills the cycles of the form
Woe yea
Downfall is near
Woe yea
Hear the cult of a Superhuman God
Atmosphere
Moving closer to the ground
Ancient sand
Holds the mighty holy land
Woe yea
Downfall is near
Woe yea
Hear the cult of a Superhuman God
Woe yea
Downfall is near
Woe yea
Hear the cult of a Superhuman God
