I can't get you out of my head
God knows I've tried
But I just can't forget
Those crazy nights
And all the things that we did

I can't get you out of my head
(OOOOO)

(OOOOO)
Maybe it was the way you talked
Maybe it was the way you laughed
I don't know just what it is

But I know I want you back
I can't get you out of my head

God knows I've tried
But I just can't forget
Those crazy nights
And all the things that we did
I can't get you out of my head

(OOOOO)
(OOOOO)
Maybe it was the way you smiled

Maybe it was the way you kissed

(Yeah, maybe)
I don't know just what it is
But I know I want this to last
I can't get you out of my head
God knows I've tried
But I just can't forget
Those crazy nights
And all the things that we did
I can't get you out of my head
I keep trying to sleep
But I'm lying awake
I'm thinking about the love I threw away
(Threw away)
But I won't let me go and I need you to know
That I... I... I... I...
I... I... I... I...
(I... I... I... I...)
Oh, I... I... I... I...
Mmm, I... I... I... I...
Can't get you out of my...
(HEAD!) I... I... I... I...
Can't get you out of my head
God knows I've tried
But I just can't forget
In my whole life
I never had it this bad
I can't get you out of my head
Out of my head
Oh I can't get you out of my head
Oh I... I... I... I...
