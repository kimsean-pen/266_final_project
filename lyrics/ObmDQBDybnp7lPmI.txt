Until I take my final breath
In a year or even less
I hope you will give me all your time
And do not forget me down the line

And I will never ask you if you will stay
Or if you will cry when I go away

Until I take my final breath
In a year or even less
I hope you will give me all your time
And do not forget me down the line

And I will never ask you if you will stay
Or if you will cry when I go away

Ice melting into the sea
Your river flowing back to me

And when you take your final breath
In many years from now, no less
I hope you feel a peace at heart
Don't be afraid to kiss the dark

And don't ever wonder if I stayed
My love for you can not die away
