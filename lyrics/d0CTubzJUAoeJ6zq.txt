So you think you've had a walk in the park.
You don't think you've been working too hard.

It looks like he's been opening up.
He don't want to but he can't stop, can't stop.

And what's the name you try to find?

And did you see the way she appeared?
She's the type that knows everyone here.

Another face but I don't know the name.
No friends and you know she's just the same.

And what's the name you try to find?

Open house and I'm opening up.
Don't want to but I can't stop, can't stop.
Open house and I'll never calm down.
Clear it up when the morning comes around.

And what's the name you try to find?
