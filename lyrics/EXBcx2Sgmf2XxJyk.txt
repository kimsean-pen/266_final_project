Our Love is
Our Love is
Beyond Fulfilment
Beyond Despair
The Ultimate Faith
The Ultimate Betrayal
And Europa has Burned
And will Burn Again

Giddy Giddy Carousel
Giddy Giddy Carousel

The blood of His Dreams
The Dreams of This Youth
For the Master-Slave
For the One-Step Men
The Right of Confession
The Rites of Confusion
Expect no more
This Love Burns Life
