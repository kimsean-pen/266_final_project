We can be like all the others
With no way to go
Paint ourselves into a corner with hope
This could be the end of everything
Afraid of
A dream of one

Let's hope these heart's for one another
It's worth all wounds, it must be
If I'm drawn and quartered
It's only for you
Hold that thought down forever
In all shades of blue

So why won't you (why won't you)?
Been waiting to
Why won't you go on and run?

Every part of me wants to believe
There's a darkness we need to feel
For the brightest light to be seen and felt inside
Only because of you

Let's hope these heart's for one another
It's worth all wounds, it must be
If I'm drawn and quartered
It's only for you
Hold that thought down forever
In all shades of blue

Why won't you go on and run with them?
Run away, go on and run away
And I'll stay
Drawn & Quartered
Drawn & Quartered
Drawn & Quartered
For you

It's all I can do, my baby

Hold that thought down forever
In all shades of blue
Why won't you?
I'll wait for you
Why won't you?
Go on and run
Why won't you
Go on and run
Run away

Let's hope these heart's for one another
It's worth all wounds, it must be

Hold that thought down forever
In all shades of blue

Always
