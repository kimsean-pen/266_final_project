The banner unfurls
Graven image
Idolater
Gather the faithful
With murderous words
Promises of gold and myrrh
To put an end to terror

With tyrant's eyes
Demonize
What you fear in the dark
I won't fail in your trust
To crush the unholy ones
Bring order to savage lands
I am your shepherd

Wage war on the senses
Intellectual Dearth
A rabid procession
To crown the new emperor

The black magic books are burned
Fed to flames
By the hand of the sorcerer
His lips screaming dark
And the black curtain falls
On a billowing dawn

And who can we trust
On this nightmare witch hunt
This haunted millennium?

And when you peer beneath
The miser's veil
With eyes ablaze
Only then will you know

That I am the ancient serpent
Spawn of the morning star
I bring endless torture and despair
The wreath of Gehenna
And now you know my name
And speak the tongues of pain
And your fettered limbs
Will know eternity

The Idolater
Will set you free
The Idolater
Beware the gods you seek
