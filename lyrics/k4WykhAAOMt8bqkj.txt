We can run away together
If that's what you want
We can hide away forever
If that's what you want

So just
Close the door
Let nobody else in our head
Close the door
We can lay right here in our bed

'Cause anything else is wasting time
You're all I've wanted
All of my life
Just let me grow old
Here by your side
Until the end of time
Till the last goodbye

Let's just live here in the moment
Sharing something real
Let's not spend these hours talking
Just give me something I can feel

Baby come on
Close to me
Let no ray of light in between
Close to me
We don't know where I end and you begin

'Cause anything else is wasting time
You're all I've wanted
All of my life
Just let me grow old
Here by your side
Until the end of time
Till the last goodbye

Let's shut the world out
See a chance and let's take it
Seize all the moments
And baby let's make it out
And we'll work it out somehow
I believe in here and now

('Cause anything else is wasting time)
You're all I've wanted
All of my life
Just let me grow old
Here by your side
Until the end of time
Till the last goodbye
(Till the last goodbye)
(You're all I've wanted) You're all I've wanted
(All of my life) All of my life
(Just let me grow old) Let me grow old
(Here by your side) Here by your side
(Until the end of time)
Till the end of
Till the end of
Till the end of
Till the end of time
Till the last goodbye
