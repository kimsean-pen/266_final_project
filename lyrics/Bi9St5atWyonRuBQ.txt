Let me make one thing clear
You can buy me a beer, but you ain't taking me home
No pick up lines, I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room
I couldn't help but notice you seemed a little down on your love too
Yeah, my heart might be breaking
But, this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'

We should be drinkin' alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinkin' alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We should be drinkin' alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reporsato
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only
But just 'cause we're lonely don't mean that we should

We should be drinkin' alone together
'Cause drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinkin' alone
Drinkin' alone, Drinkin' alone (together)
Baby, we shouldn't be drinkin' alone (we should be drinking alone)
Drinkin' alone, Drinkin' alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinkin' alone

I'll pretend that I care
Baby, pull up a chair
We'll stay here 'til they make us go home

We should be drinkin' alone
Oh, we should be drinkin' alone together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinkin' alone
Drinkin' alone, Drinkin' alone (together)
Baby, we shouldn't be drinkin' alone (we should be drinking alone)
Drinkin' alone, Drinkin' alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinkin' alone

We should be drinkin' alone
