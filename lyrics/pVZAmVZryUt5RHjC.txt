(?) doesn't have a meaning, I took it for (?) to come
And past (?) I even don't know, everything is better (?) to show

What we don't see we'll never be

We stand deeper (?), we're using (?)
I fall into everything (?), I'm waking up (?)

What we don't see we'll never be
What we don't see we'll never be, oh

I know I couldn't better, we grow so much longer
I wish I (?) be there (?)
You'll never-never be on (?) tomorrow
We are so long together holding on to

What we don't see we'll never be
What we don't see we'll never be
What we don't see we'll never be
