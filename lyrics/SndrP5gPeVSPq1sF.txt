Sino, my roll
Double up, triple up when I see ya
Forget me, amnesia
No windows I swear I don't need ya

Bubblin', 4 bottles in
We doubling Secco or Gin
Forget me, couldn't care less
Unholy, white sin reckless
Most of my friends, suicidal

Got b-o-l-o-l-o, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And it's high, so high, do you feel this rain?
My oh my, every time near heaven

Lost it all, at the Sino
Emotions got me acting like I need ya
But I care less, couldn't care less
Double up, triple up, when I see ya

Bubblin, 6 bottles in
Sippin Contrieu mixed with the white sin
All my tears are, all frozen
Put 'em on the card, I swear I don't know them

B-o-l-o, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
High so high, can you feel the strain?
Why oh why, so near to heaven
High so high, can you feel the rain?
Why oh why, every time near heaven
B-o-l-o, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
B-o-l-o-l-o, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

All my tears are, all frozen
Put 'em on the card I swear I don't know them
B-o-l-o, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Sino, my roll
Ammy-Ammy-Ammy-ammmy-ammmy, amnesia
