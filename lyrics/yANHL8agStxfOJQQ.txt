If you're looking for Atlantis
You should cast your eye on me
Put your two and two together

Don't you know who built Atlantis
Then returned to the sea
Don't you know who owns the weather?

Rain or shine

Sure is good to seek a challenge
Sure is fine to set your sights
Sure is foolish to be blinded

There are legions out there churching
Searching for the holy grail
Isn't one of them can find it

All this time

You should be loving someone
And you know who it must be
Cause you'll never find Atlantis
Til you make that someone me

You should be loving someone
And you know who it must be
Cause you'll never find Atlantis
Til you make that someone me

Say you do find your volcano
And the darn thing is still hot
Lesson one: Child don't waste it

Lesson two: The world's your cherry
But tomorrow? Maybe not
Lesson three: Come on and taste it

All this time

You should be loving someone
And you know who it must be
Cause you'll never find Atlantis
Til you make that someone me

You should be loving someone
And you know who it must be
Cause you'll never find Atlantis
Til you make that someone me
