他從不將姿態放低
目中無人卻彬彬有禮
深邃的眼像座迷宮
漩渦流向了無底洞

別再懷疑
他在玩一個戲法
眼花繚亂的謎
飄不散地伴著任由風兒吹

I just want to be, want to be loved
Guess we're bound to be, bound to be lost
I could wait another night
Just to take another bite on you
最後你不在 那我睡了別再來了吧

I just want to be, want to be loved
Guess we're bound to be, bound to be lost
I could wait another night
Just to take another bite on you
最後你不在 那我睡了別再來了吧

Then wear the gold hat, like it would move me
If you can bounce high, bounce for me in one, two, three

夏日玫瑰盛開
花瓣飛, 飛, 飛
我不會再等待
For a day, day, day

The girl really worth having won't wait for anybody
The girl really worth having won't wait for anybody

I just want to be, want to be loved
Guess we're bound to be, bound to be lost
I could wait another night
Just to take another bite on you
最後你不在 那我睡了別再來了吧
