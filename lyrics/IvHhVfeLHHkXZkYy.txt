(Verse)
I placed by and I wonder why,
Calculate, calculate, calculate.
I divide and I multiply,
Calculate, calculate, calculate.

(Pre-Chorus)
Sensations versus thinking,
An equation all good for nothing
Same old song, what's going on?
Calculate, calculate, calculate.

(Chorus)
I come by and all is fly,
Generate, generate, generate.
You got no how, I got to know now,
Calculate, calculate, calculate.

Sensations versus thinking,
Oh, no, no, no, it's beginning.

(Verse)
Get her CD, haven't sworn,
Generate, generate, generate.

(Chorus)
That's the way that go,
Cascade and unknown,
Accelerate and I go,
That's the way that I go, too.

(Pre-Chorus)
Sensations judged thinking,
Equation no good for nothing.
Fast crash fear us some theme,
Fast track feel us some theme.

(Verse)
I can't get behind a war track mind,
Calculate, calculate, calculate.
Rising suns put you on the re-run,
Generate, generate, generate.

(Pre-Chorus)
Sensations got me thinking,
An equation all good for nothing
God keeps an upper thumb,
Generate, generate, generate.

(Chorus)
That's the way that go,
Cascade and unknown,
Accelerate and I go,
Close it and I go, too.

Sensations judge my thinking
Oh, no, no, no good for nothing.
Fast crash fearless and theme,
Flashtrack fear us a theme.

Cascade and I go,
Accelerate and I go,
Sensations judge my thinking,
Oh, no, no, no, it's beginning.
Fast crash fearless and fear
Flashtrack fear us a theme.
