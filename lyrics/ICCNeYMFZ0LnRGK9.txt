Take a step in the land
full of darkness and lies,
There' s no living,
Everything died!
No pale blue sky,
No faith in your eyes,
This is my land of darkness built inside!

Take away from me posessions and love!
A new beginning. A Cold World.
With eternal echoes from the night
I'll teach you to find the light!

The darkness calls my name, and I will follow!
The night is getting colder, the frost paralyzed my pain!

Take a step in the land
full of darkness and lies,
There' s no living,
Everything died!
This is my land of darkness stuck in ice!
