My baby don't love me no more
I don't know why
Ooh, my baby
Lon't
Love me no more
I don't know why
All I know
I'm gonna lay down and cry

But I came home
From work that day
Check the mail to survey
That's when I saw
Them love letters from
That man on the side

My baby don't love
Me no more
I don't know why
All I know
I'm just gonna
Lay down and cry

My neighbour say,
it was nice
But mine was a
Sight for sore eyes
I stay true to you, baby
Why you gone
Tell me lies

My baby don't
Love me no more
I don't know why
Wow, all I know
I'm gonna lay
Down and cry

Ooh...

Bah bah bah...
