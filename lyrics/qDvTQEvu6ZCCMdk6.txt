From tombs of forgotten times,
I summon thee from thy sleep
Across the river, ferocious and wild,
From the graves and vaults of my thoughts

I call for you my brother let me leave this awful life
And drift away beyond the borders of this realm
You wandered off before me, now come back and pick me up
Unchain my soul and bring me where all light will fade

I cannot stay, I will not wait, I have to leave
This world forever, I swear not to return
Behind their masks there stand but slaves and servitude
Was not our trade so rise and set me free and bring me home

So rise from the dead
Release me from this pain
I raise the dead
To unfold the gates to Hell

I summon all the forces from the darkness that gave birth
To our exsistence and lit the hellish flames
We shall stand tall and wander
Where the heavens can not reach us as
the path will lead into the dark and cold

We can not stay and wait, the passage has been cleared
The gates are open, there is no turning back
Those left behind, shall die as slaves, as servants of
Their humble ways and Satan will be laughing from his throne

So rise from the dead
Release me from these chains
I raise the dead
To reclaim my throne in Hell

And before the rise of dawn, my soul will be free

I call for you my brother let me leave this awful life
And drift away beyond the borders of this realm
You wandered off before me, now come back and pick me up
Unchain my soul and bring me where all light will fade

I cannot stay, I will not wait, I have to leave
This world forever, I swear not to return
Behind their masks there stand but slaves and servitude
Was not our trade so rise and set me free and bring me home

So rise from the dead
Release me from this pain
I raise the dead
To unfold the gates to Hell

So rise from the dead
Release me from these chains
I raise the dead
To reclaim my throne in Hell.
