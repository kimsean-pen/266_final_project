Come on closer, won't you tell me what you got?
Wait a minute girl, you're something that you're not
Big cities screaming, driving feathers to and fro
Brass in pocket, thought you hit it when you walked up to my door

I've been down this road so long
Been miles and miles of freaks before

Aww, get out the door, get out the door
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door

Get out the door
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door

Like transformers, girl, there's more than meets the eye
Another beer and then I might end up buyin'
The city screams it's full of Angelos and Toms
Never underestimate the danger of Sunset Boulevard

I've been down this road so long
Been miles and miles of freaks before

Aww, get out the door, get out the door
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door

Get out the door
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door, aww, ah aww, aww, ah aww

I've been down this road so long
Been miles and miles of freaks before
Think I stop and think I strong
But never could have been so wrong, so wrong

Get out the door, get out the door
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door

Get out the door
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door

Get out the door, aww
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door

Get out the door, aww
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door
