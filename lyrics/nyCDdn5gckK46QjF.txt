Delia, oh Delia
Delia all my life
If I hadn't have shot poor Delia
I'd a had her for my wife

Delia's gone
one more round
Delia's gone

I went up to Memphis
And I me Delia there
Found her in her parlour
And I tied her to her chair

Delia's gone
one more round
Delia's gone

She was low down and, triflin
She was cold and mean
Kind of evil make me
Want to grab my sub-mochine

Delia's gone
one more round
Delia's gone

First time I shot her
Shot her in the side
Hard to watch her suffer
But with the second shot she died

Delia's gone
one more round
Delia's gone

But Jailer oh' Jailer
Jailer I cant sleep
Cause all around the bedside
I hear the patter of Delia's feet

Delia's gone
one more round
Delia's gone

So if your woman's devilish
You can let her run
Or you can bring her down
And do her, like Delia got done

Delia's gone
one more round
Delia's gone

Delia's gone
one more round
Delia's gone
