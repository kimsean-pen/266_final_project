I'm sick of losing
my patience
out of time
lacking rhythm
barely concious
over sensitive
feeling weaker
as I stumble around

Get out of my mind

In the morning
rests the paper
heavy snow fall
wakes the neighbors
the alarm calls
I clean out my eyes
feeling nauseous
as the world spins around

Get out of my mind
