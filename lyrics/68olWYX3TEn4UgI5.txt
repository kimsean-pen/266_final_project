She's a sweetheart in the summer
Summertime is here again
She's a sweetheart in the summer
And I hope it never ends

Winter days that never end
Frozen nights with you under the covers
But the lonely time we spend
Is worth it in the end when summer comes

Making love and holding hands
Rolling in the sun and sand together
Every year when summer comes around
We fall in love again

She's a sweetheart in the summer
Summertime is here again
She's a sweetheart in the summer
And I hope it never ends

I'm gonna take you far away
Pack the car, let's get away for a while
We'll find a motel room
And call it home for just a couple days

Love to see your smiling face
Nothing else is sweeter in the world
'Cause when everything is said and done
You will always be my girl

She's a sweetheart in the summer
Summertime is here again
She's a sweetheart in the summer
And I hope it never ends

Sweetheart in the summer time
Sweetheart in the summer time
Endless summertime with you
