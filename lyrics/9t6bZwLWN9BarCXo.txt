Thought that I died today
Walked off the stage
Faded away into the clouds
To the gig in the sky
And when I arrived
The angels were singing a song
Yeah you know the one
Are you singing along?

Thought I'd know just what to do
That it'd be how I wanted it to be of so new
But counting me in
I had to give in
Make the thunder and lightning sing
In the eye of the storm there's no right and no wrong

So long, so long
Someday all the world will sing my song
Still life remains
Somewhere in my heart the beat goes on

Thought it was the end of the world
Deep with guitars and all that I understand is here
Through mental un word I'm misunderstood

Wasting my money and fame
I'd throw it away just to prove that I can
I'm the last of a dying breed
And it's not the end of the world, oh no
It's not even the end of the day

So long, so long
Someday all the world will sing my song
Still life remains
Somewhere in my heart the beat goes on

So long, so long
Someday all the world will sing my song
Still life remains
Somewhere in my heart the beat goes on

So long, so long
Someday all the world will sing my song
Still life remains
Somewhere in my heart the beat goes on
