I look for joy in a strange place
From the back of the bar, from afar
I see the look on my mama's face
When her son's in the corner, undone

She says that my life is over
"Boy, you don't know what you got till it's gone
Come put your head upon my shoulder"
She gave me her hand, but I ignored her

Oh, Dr. John
What am I doing, what am I doing wrong?
'Cause I keep on trying
Something ain't going, something ain't going on, Dr. John

I look for joy in a strange place
In the back of a bar, from afar
I see the look on my daddy's face
When his son's fallin' over, undone

Father, my life is over
I didn't know what I had, now it's gone
Can I lay my head upon your shoulder?
If I fall asleep, will it be over?

Oh, Dr. John
What am I doing, what am I doing wrong?
'Cause I keep on trying
Something ain't going, something ain't going on

Oh, Dr. John
What am I doing, what am I doing wrong?
'Cause I keep on trying
Something ain't going, something ain't going on

You say I'm a big heartbreaker
But Doctor, I'd never hurt you
Isn't it obvious?

Oh, Dr. John
What am I doing, what am I doing wrong?
'Cause I keep on trying
Something ain't going, something ain't going on

Oh, Dr. John (Another day, another break up)
We hold on and on, we hold on and on and on
I keep on trying (Another day, another wake up)
We hold on and on, we hold on and on and on

Oh, Dr. John (Another day, another break up)
And what am I doing (We hold on and on)
What am I doing wrong? (We hold on and on and on)
'Cause I, I keep on trying (Another day, another weak up)
Something ain't going (We hold on and on)
Something ain't going on (We hold on and on and on)

Oh, Dr. John (Another day, another break up)
What am I doing (We hold on and on)
What am I doing wrong? (We hold on and on and on)
'Cause I keep on trying (Another day, another weak up)
Something ain't going (We hold on and on)
Something ain't going on (We hold on and on and on)

Dr. John, oh, Dr. John
