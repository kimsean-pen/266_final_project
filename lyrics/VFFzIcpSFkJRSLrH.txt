I'll be fine on my own, she said, I don't need you inside my head
(She'll be fine on her own, she'll be fine on her own)
I'll be fine on my own, she said,
all my love's wrapped in shades of red
(She'll be fine on her own, she'll be fine on her own)

No holds barred in the ring so you'll fight me
Give 'em hell, give 'em teeth like you taught me
Tireless mess, seeking thrills getting bitey
When I'm in doubt
Pudgy face kissing lace in the backseat
Wrinkled toss of the coin that I can't see
Don't forget I have you to be like me
Where around is enough for a family

I'll be fine on my own, she said, I don't need you inside my head
(She'll be fine on her own, she'll be fine on her own)
I'll be fine on my own, she said,
all my love's wrapped in shades of red
(She'll be fine on her own, she'll be fine on her own)

Growing pains splaying rain on the high sea
Scale a tree, snap a branch so you can't leave
On the ground, lost and found, understand me
Putting words in my mouth, trying to get free
Solid punch kind of eyes make 'em wobbly
Gothic vine growing fire in the lobby
Lighten up, buttercup, get a hobby
Yeah, swing, sucker, swing, finish sobbing

She'll be fine on her own... she'll be fine on her own
She'll be fine on her own... she'll be fine on her own
She'll be fine on her own, she said
She'll be fine on her own, she said
She'll be fine on her own, she said
She'll be fine on her own, she'll be fine on her own
She'll be fine on her own, she'll be fine on her own

I'll be fine, I'm alright, it's my body
Gonna stick to my guns, like you taught me
Holy hell, I can tell that you hate me
Dying moon, keep me up, keep me waiting
I'll be fine, I'm alright, it's my body
Gonna stick to my guns, like you taught me
Holy hell, I can tell that you hate me
Dying moon, keep me up, keep me waiting
