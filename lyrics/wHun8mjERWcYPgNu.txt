Smell your skin
Feel your breath
You on my side
I couldn't resist

I hope I'll understand some day
What's the meaning of this crazy game
It is real and pure

T.N.T. for the brain

If there's no pain
Rules are still the same
I'm with you, just lead me
I'm ready to play

T.N.T. for the brain

Don't be scared and have no fear
I will show you what it means

If there's no pain
Rules are still the same
I'm with you, just lead me
I'm ready to play

T.N.T. for the brain

Don't be scared and have no fear
I will show you what it means

If there's no pain
Rules are still the same
I'm with you, just lead me
I'm ready to play

T.N.T. for the brain

What you feel is insane
It is love and not a game

If there's no pain
Rules are still the same
I'm with you, just lead me
I'm ready to play

T.N.T. for the brain
