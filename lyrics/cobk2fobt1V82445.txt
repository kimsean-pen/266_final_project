I won't play your games no more
No, I won't play your games no more
If you won't believe my motives all
If you want to leave this lonely hole
Well I won't play your game no more

When the colors fade I'm locked out of this
When the colors fade, I'll go

And when the votes are made I might make a mark
When the votes are made I'll know

We were formed from a...
Small set of emotions
We're over ground

Nothing here but a...
We'll set it in motion
To let it stop

I won't play your games no more
No, I won't play your games no more
If you won't believe my motives all
If you want to leave this lonely hole
Well I won't play your game no more
I won't

With the covers on I'll breathe in the days
With the covers I'll give

We were formed from a...
Small set of emotions
With a undertow

Live in half-lies
Going through the motions
We won't let this grow

I won't play your games no more
No, I won't play your games no more
If you won't believe my motives all
If you want to leave this lonely hole

We were formed from a...
Small set of emotions
The undertow

Live in half-lies
Going through the motions
They won't let us go
