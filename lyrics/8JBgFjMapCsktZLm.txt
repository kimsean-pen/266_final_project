The building turned it's back ignored my call
The concrete looks too thin to break my fall
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene
I counted people as I neared the street below
Whoa-oa-oa
Below
Whoa-oa-oa
I saw it all I saw it all go down

The shadow grew as he approached the ground
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene
They turned away as he came near the street below
Whoa-oa-oa
Below
Whoa-oa-oa
Below
Lets forget this all move on
Lets forget this all move on

Lets forget this all move on

Lets forget this all move on
Lets forget this all move on
Lets forget this all move on
Lets forget this all move on
