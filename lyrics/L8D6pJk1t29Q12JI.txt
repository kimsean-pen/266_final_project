I'm doing nothing
'Cause then at least I'm doing nothing wrong.

And I'm gonna stay in on my own
And turn off my telephone

If nothing's gained then nothing's won.
And you can tell them
Yeah you can say whatever I don't care (yeah-yeah).
Then if you wanna play it cool then I got news for you

It's getting hotter, hotter in here.
So when I speak listen
This is my decision
And you keep on messing up the words. (Oh-oh-oh)
So when I speak listen
'Cause you keep on pushing
Like I need permission to be heard. (Oh-oh-oh)
I'm gonna lift to lift it higher
I'm gonna lift to lift it higher.
So when I speak listen this is my decision

And you keep on messing up the words.
I'm getting closer (closer, closer).
I'm moving into there, and I think you know.
'Cause I am sick of playing games
And I'm not gon' say no names

But you and I know who to blame.
So you can tell them
Yeah you can go ahead and put it straight.
'Cause I am finishing myself, and I do not need your help

I'm gonna do this do it right.
So when I speak listen
This is my decision
And you keep on messing up the words. (Oh-oh-oh)
So when I speak listen
'Cause you keep on pushing
Like I need permission to be heard. (Oh-oh-oh)
I'm gonna lift to lift it higher
I'm gonna lift to lift it higher.
So when I speak listen this is my decision

And you keep on messing up the words.
I'm gonna lift to lift it.
When you go higher, I go higher.
I'm gonna lift to lift it.
Yeah you can try but I'll go higher.
I'm gonna lift to lift it.
The only thing boy, all that you can do is listen

So listen ...
(So when I speak ...)
So when I speak listen
This is my decision (Yeah-ei-yeah)
And you keep on messing up the words. (Oh-oh-oh)
(Keep on messing up the words)
So when I speak listen
'Cause you keep on pushing
Like I need permission to be heard. (Oh-oh-oh)
(Need permission to be heard ...)
I'm gonna lift to lift it higher
I'm gonna lift to lift it higher. (Higher...)
So when I speak listen this is my decision (Ohh)
And you keep on messing up the words.
