So you say, all your white flags are up
And that you've had enough and that you
Were tired of collecting dust, you say
Everything always looks the same and
You made your brand new face to match
Your brand new place, you say all your distress
Calls have gone out and your ship is going down

Well I say it to myself all the time
Stop living half a life and stop
Feeling like I'm half alive

I can't get enough, I'm not satisfied
I've wasted my time with this daily grind
A single file line, is this real life
I've been telling myself sometimes
What matters is on the inside

Do you remember when we had all the answers
And can you really remember when we
Wished for anything better
Just to feel like it's been forever
Does it feel like a broken record
A head full of yesterdays
You keep wishing your life away
You can't keep looking over you own shoulder
Things'll never look up unless you start to move forward

Well I say it to myself all the time
Stop living half a life and stop
Feeling like I'm half alive

I can't get enough, I'm not satisfied
I've wasted my time with this daily grind
A single file line, is this real life
I keep telling myself sometimes
What matters is on the inside

I can't get enough, I'm not satisfied
I've wasted my time with this daily grind
I can't get enough, I'm just getting by
I can't stand this design for our bitter lives
I keep feeling lost and I'm not satisfied
With traffic and turnpikes and these tired eyes

I can't get enough, I'm not satisfied
I've wasted my time with this daily grind
A single file line, is this real life
I keep telling myself sometimes
What matters is on the inside
