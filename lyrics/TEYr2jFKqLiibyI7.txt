I can't believe it's happened to me
Taken over so completely
I was content but nevertheless
You've changed my life for the best

I want to hold you 'til I lose time
I never want to be back in my mind

The way that I'm feeling
Love it is love
Keep on with the feeling
Love it is love

Begins without thinking
Be friends with a touch
Keep on with the feeling
Love it is love
Love it is love
Love it is love

So all a sudden stupid makes sense
I succumb and I've no defense
You make me happy inside I dance
Never stopping, fuel is a glance

I've fallen deeper and I am the girl
I used to want to be you spin my world

Onward motion, pure devotion
Onward motion, pure devotion

The way that I'm feeling
Love it is love
Keep on with the feeling
Love it is love

Begins without thinking
Be friends with a touch
Keep on with the feeling
Love it is love
Love it is love
Love it is love

I thought I knew my heart was lone and stark
But baby, oh
You've moved within me, never go
Never go, never go, never go

The way that I'm feeling
Love it is love
Keep on with the feeling
Love it is love

Begins without thinking
Be friends with a touch
Keep on with the feeling
Love it is love

The way that I'm feeling
Love it is love
Keep on with the feeling
Love it is love

Begins without thinking
Be friends with a touch
Keep on with the feeling
Love it is love

Love it is love, it is love, it is love
Love it is love
Love it is love, it is love, it is love
Love it is love
