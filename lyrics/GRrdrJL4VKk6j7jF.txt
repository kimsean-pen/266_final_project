You say you got to go and find yourself
You say that you're becoming someone else
Don't recognize the face in the mirror looking back at you

You say you're leaving as you look away
I know there's really nothing left to say
Just know I'm here whenever you need me, I'll wait for you

So I'll let you go, I'll set you free
And when you see what you need to see
When you find you
Come back to me

...
Take your time I won't go anywhere
Picture you with the wind in your hair

I'll keep your things right where you left them, I'll be here for you
And I'll let you go, I'll set you free
And when you see what you need to see
When you find you

Come back to me
And I hope you find everything that you need
I'll be right here waiting to see
When you find you

Come back to me
And I can't get close if you're not there
I can't get inside if there's no soul to bare
I can't fix you, I can't save you

It's something you'll have to do
So I'll let you go, I'll set you free
And when you see what you need to see
When you find you
Come back to me

...
(Come back to me)
So I'll let you go, I'll set you free
And when you see what you need to see

When you find you
Come back to me
...
And I hope you find everything that you need
I'll be right here waiting to see
When you find you
Come back to me
...
When you find you
Come back to me
...
When you find you
Come back to me
...
When you find you
Come back to me
...
