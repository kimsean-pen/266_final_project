We gotta tone it, baby, down
It's hard for me to say
It was all in vain
You can't pretend I'm something else
When you let me down

Love me all the way
(you promised)
Talking all day
(you promised)
Have you ever noticed what I do?
Feeling all the way
(like homeless)
Hurting me
(better chuckles)
Why'd you wanna keep it here?
Just drop it away

Look what you've done, look!
I'm petrified
Don't come close
(look what you've done, look what you've done)
I wish it didn't hurt like this
(look what you've done, look what you've done)
I wish it didn't hurt like

How'd we get like this?
How'd we get like that?
When the lights went down
Drop it away, just drop it away
(and down)

Burn it away
I'd better keep my head out of it
Weep me away
Don't wanna make the same mistakes again
Throw it away
'Cause now I'm sober, don't wanna start it over
Just drop it away

Colors never fade
(u know it!)
Trouble on the way
(I solve it!)
Have u ever noticed what I do?
Bring it all together
(complex)
Hard for me to say, we're broken
I gotta keep it real
Just drop it away

Burn it away
I'd better keep my head out of it
Weep me away
Don't wanna make the same mistakes again
Throw it away
'Cause now I'm sober, don't wanna start it over
Just drop it away

Spark in the dark
(I go blind)
Crack in the sky
(I won't find)
Ready to fall with a loud sound

Spark in the dark
(I go blind)
Crack in the sky
(I won't find)
Ready to fall with a loud sound

Burn it away
(I'd better keep my head out of it)
Weep me away
Throw it away
(I'd better keep my head out of it)
Keep it away

Burn it away
(burn it away)
I'd better keep my head out of it
(burn it away)
Weep me away
(burn it, burn it away)
Don't wanna make the same mistakes again
Throw it away, yeah
(burn it away)
'Cause now I'm sober, don't wanna start it over
(burn it away, yeah)
Just drop it away
