Nightmare world
Reflected as a dream
Vision blurred
This surely can not be

Twisted now
Far from reality
Delving into depths
Mankind's depravity

Violated planet - world bureaucracy
Graved with resentment - global lunacy

Stricken thoughts
Terror overrides
Pierce the fragments
Of the mind

Deep regret now
Engraved upon the soul
Mortality now echoes
Throughout this world

Avarice - leads to compulsion
Ruined world - beyond recognition

When we understand
Will it be too late
To future generation
A legacy of hate
