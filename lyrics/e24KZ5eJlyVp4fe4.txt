One more heartache, baby,
I can't take it now.
My heart is carrying such a heavy load,
One more ache would break it.
Just like a camel,
With a heavy pack,
One last straw, they say,
Broke the camel's back.
Oh, wo, babe, I can't take it,
I can't stand it now.
One more heartache,
It would turn me right around.
First you build my hopes up high,
Then you let me down.
Like a house that's built of toothpicks,
Set up on a kitchen chair,
One last toothpick tore it down,
The foundation was not able
Oh, wo, baby, I can't take it,
I can't stand it now.
One more heartache,

One more heartache, babe
I can't take it now.
My heart is carrying such a heavy load,
One more ache would break it.
Just like a camel,
With a heavy pack, yeah,
One last straw, they say,
Broke the camel's back.
Oh, wo, babe, I can't take it,
I can't stand it now.
One more
Heartache babe
One more, now
Heartache baby
Without your love,
Without your love, baby,
I can't stand it no longer.
Come on
Won't you listen to my plea,
Please baby
Please baby
