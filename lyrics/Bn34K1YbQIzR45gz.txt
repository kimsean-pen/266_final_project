Are we really happy
With this lonely game we play
Looking for the right words to say
Searching but not finding
Understanding anyway
We're lost in this masquerade
Both afraid to say we're just to far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of leaving disappear

Each time I see your eyes
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reasons
Why we carry on this way
We're lost in this masquerade
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of leaving disappear
Each time I see your eyes
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason
Why we carry on this way
We're lost in the masquerade
We're lost in the masquerade
(We're lost in the masquerade)
