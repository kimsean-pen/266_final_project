Stalled in the mid' of my street
I'm needing some clarity
And I carve the radio to
Find a song like you, like you

Oh no, I'm not looking back
To rewrite our story's past
I gave up years ago
And as guarded as I am
I've got things I've left unsaid
I'm not a kid

I'm living in the shade of my mind
I just stop for a second, and baby, I reason
I move forward like the seasons

That season ends, then another begins
I'm still chasing me, finding who I am
I am 21, feel like I'm over and done
Most days I've lost, some nights I've won
No drug that can change me
No one who can make me
I made myself and I should know that well
That night off 44, thought it was the end
I wish he would love me
In the way that I loved him

I'm not looking back to
Rewrite my fucking past
I gave up years ago
And as guarded as I am
I've got things I've left unsaid
I'm not a kid

I'm living in the shade of my mind
I just stop for a second, and baby, I reason
I move forward like the seasons

I move forward like the seasons

Oh, and I move forward like the seasons
Forward like the seasons
Forward like the seasons
Forward, forward
I move forward like the seasons
Forward like the seasons
Forward like the seasons
Forward, forward, forward
