Tell me, pretty girl
Do you know who I am?
Have you ever seen me
As your friend?
Everything we have
Is those hungry nights
But there's so much
Left unsastisfied

All those little things you told me
Ain't good enough to show me
That we're gonna make it through the time

I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And I know that
I'm doing right
Together we're still
So far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And the more
I try to be your light
I can't get any closer
To your heart

Now that I'm afraid
Just to ask for more
I'm still waiting
As I did before
If you only say
That it's not too late
We could then rely
Upon our fate

All those little things you tell me
Could bear enough to show me
That we're gonna make it through the time

I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And know that
I'm telling right
Together we're still
So far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And the more
I try to be your light
I can't get any closer
To your heart
To your heart

I found out
I found out

I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And I know that
I'm doing right
Together we're still
So far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And the more
I try to be your light
I can't get any closer
To your heart

I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And I know that
I'm doing right
Together we're still
So far apart
Together we're still
So far apart
