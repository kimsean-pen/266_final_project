Talking in my sleep
Cursing through my teeth
Sweating in the heat
Stuck inside this dream of darkening frustration
liars in my dream
I'm frightened and I'm weak
There's nothing left for me
And the vision I endure are simply entertainment
Dark figures chasing me
I hear the wolf that cries
See them multiply
You're ablaze behind the eyes
They burn into my memory
A sudden sense of hope
The virtue of my ghost
You're another ugly host
And I can't believe that you would just
Deny everything

I choose to live free
It took a second warning then I said goodbye
With tainted eyes I need to believe
It took a little longer to sympathise

And you were hoping I would give in to you

I won't dance because you want me to
No Romance
Deep down I only want to be the same
Now there's nowhere left to hide
Game of chance
I roll the dice for you
Hopless glance

Deep down I only want to be the same
Now there's nowhere left to hide

The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return
I'm living such a life
Therein lies your problem
Imperfect, circular, entropy
The fatal conclusion

With a little sympathy it'll burn inside
Let the fires decide
Imperfect and circular

I wont comfort you
No it won't be the same
There's nowhere left to hide
And I wont comfort you
No it won't be the same
There's nowhere left to hide
And I wont comfort you
No it won't be the same
There's nowhere left to hide
