Clumsy, always quivering
Always searching for your thingg
You don't work, but you cannot find a rest
'Cause you gave up too soon

Old man sitting in your trap
Two lovers passing by
Don't be ashamed, don't be upset,
Enjoy it, dear ... 'cause once you did the same

It's not too late ... to charm away your ancient fears
It's not too late ... to be wild for roundabouts ... to be
Wild for life ...

Old man lying in your bed
Your friends are passing by
It's just a rule, kissing you goodbye,
Enjoy it, dear ... 'cause once you did the same

I came across a feww old things
Remembering the past
"Spare the rod and spoil the child ...
There's no fool like an old fool!"

It's not too late ... to start again
It's not too late ... to charm away your ancient fears
It's not too late ... to be wild for roundabouts ... to be
Wild for life ...
