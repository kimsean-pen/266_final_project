We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love

Turn up the love
We turnin' up the love
Turn it up now

Get, get it poppin' hot tamale
Dirty bass we so baddy-baddy, ow
Too legit we can't quit the party
Super freaks no Illuminati

So one two hit the booze
We on Youtube nothing to lose
So let it loose 'cause the sheep don't sleep
Like pop pop pop pop (aight)

Don't low to the L-O (L-O)
V E gotta get mo' (get mo')
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give (turn it up)

Turned up you don't hear me no (hear me no)
Here's some love for your stereo (stereo)
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give

We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We turnin' up the love

We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We turnin' up the love

Go ahead now floss your love
Like a heart of gold (gold)
Dirty bass to bake a Tootsie Roll (go)
If you go low on the floor

I got a crew that will handle that cookie jar
Damn girl
I ain't tryin' to be rude
Spread love like a guestlist

You plus two (plus two)
That's what you call a move
Like pop pop pop pop (aight)
Don't low to the L-O (L-O)

V-E gotta get mo' (get mo')
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give (turn it up)
Turned up you don't hear me no (hear me no)

Here's a love for your stereo (stereo)
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
Like pop pop pop pop
Turn me on like this your song

Dirty bass got love to give (turn it up now)
Mad monopoly all night long
Dirty bass got love to give
Yo let me see that grill

From ear to ear
So much lovin' in the atmosphere
The good times roll with me right here
I got nothing but love to give

We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We turnin' up the love

We are one tonight
And we breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We turnin' up the love

Turn it up now
Turn it up now
Dirty bass got
(Love to give, love to give)
Like pop pop pop pop
