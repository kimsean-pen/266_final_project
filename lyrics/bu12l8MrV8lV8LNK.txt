All is underway
Farther than the eye can see
No one is afraid
But everyone looks frightened

Awful need of self, I've seen it
Awful need of self
Awful need of self, I've seen it
Awful need of self

Where is known is what, what
Where are people going, going?
Leave yourself an awful start
Just don't be afraid of what you might forget

I've seen an awful need of self
Awful need of self, I've seen it
Awful need of self
Awful need of self, I've seen it
Awful need of self
Awful need of self, I've seen it
Awful need of self

No one is afraid
But everyone looks frightened
Drunker than you think
Too big for one small box
Driftin' on the grave
Useless thought, no one sees you anymore
'Cause you're not there

Awful need of self, I've seen it
Awful need of self
Awful need of self, I've seen it
Awful need of self

No one is afraid
But everyone looks frightened
Drunker than you think
Too big for one small box
Driftin' on the grave
Useless thought, no one sees you anymore
'Cause you're not there
