I got a tall can of beer in my hand
And a big middle finger to the man
I got a couple hillbilly friends that shoot whiskey
And a million nights I don't regret

It's a backwoods, feel good, up all night
Party like it's 1969

Trailer trashed down by the river
Hop up in the shotgun, grab another cold one
Trailer trashed, the party's gettin' bigger
Put on your boots, kick out the city slickers
It's a hometown, throwdown party with some country class
Tonight we're gettin' trailer trashed

Now, I got some long necks and a couple of kegs
With them pretty little things and them pretty little legs
And I hope to get lucky with some bourbon from Kentucky
Or some sweet moonshine from South Caroline

It's a backwoods, feel good, up all night
Party like it's 1969

Trailer trashed down by the river
Hop up in the shotgun, grab another cold one
Trailer trashed, the party's gettin' bigger
Put on your boots, kick out the city slickers
It's a hometown, throwdown party with some country class
Tonight we're gettin' trailer trashed

I got a tall can of beer in my hand
And a big middle finger to the man

Trailer trashed down by the river
Hop up in the shotgun, grab another cold one
Trailer trashed, the party's gettin' bigger
Put on your boots, kick out the city slickers
Trailer trashed down by the river
Trailer trashed, the party's gettin' bigger
'Cause it's a hometown throwdown party with some country class
Tonight we're gettin' trailer trashed
We're gettin' trailer trashed
Gettin' trailer trashed
