You try slipping from what we have
See what welcomes you
Cause I see you try to anchor
In a sanctuary
Leave it behind at the same time
You feel the comfort the time to come
A stillness is undone

Just go and wander
There in the sugarcanes

Alien FM, stale love
Interference again, stale love

I can never tell just what you're always thinking of but
It's not me, repeatedly you're
Calling from a train
Or some other place
You lean our love on these with grace
Oh, I'm gonna lose you
I'm headed for the tunnel where we lose connection
Of another's brain, stale love

Stale love

'Cause you're crystal now
But there you'll be gone
You're crystal now
'Cause you're crystal now
But there you'll be gone
You're crystal now
You're crystal now
