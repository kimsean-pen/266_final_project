Red lights
Stone walls
Rise above our heads
Golden sun
Ray of light
across the room

The sun makes its way in
Destined to wake
You're in my
sight again
Faithful guide
of vanity
Here we stand
among no others
From within
hall of the dead

They start going through
the room with white lights

Push forward
Lifeless body at the sign
lay around us
listening above us
Over our heads
they all live
listening
lifted above us

We must leave this place
Of deathly decay

Don't look back, press on
