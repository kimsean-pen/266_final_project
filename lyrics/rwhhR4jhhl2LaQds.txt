Unopened eyes revealing fear and anguish
Told of untrue myth

Viewing apparitions in unsightly [unsaintly] ways
Need not hunger for the feast ablaze

Search across barren land
Inhibitions of solitude for the rising hand

Pepetual dreams
Deafening screams

Dreams and knowledge perishing to
A nonexisting existing state

Viewing apparitions in unsightly [unsaintly] ways
Need not hunger for the feast ablaze

Seeking ways of human torment
False beliefs
Beliefs in hate

Perpetual dreams
Deafening screams

Goden
Hear the piercing cries
Of the Fourth Horseman in the wind

Goden
Unleashed by the angels
From the four corners of the earth

Not forseen [never seen] is a rising apocalypse

Through the dust of the Elders
Left for their wrath [the wrath]
Eternal tears
Rising sun [son]
