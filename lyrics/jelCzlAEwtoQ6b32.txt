Threatened by the law,
I crawled in a comfortable lap
Crucified by love,
I fell in a predictable trap.
All at what cost?
All I could think about was that.
And all that was lost,
That I've seen in dreams.

Simple as 1 2 3 4,
methodical persuasion
I know you've done this before,
You've mastered the equation.
But you'll only hurt yourself, not me.
And anyone you've done it to before,
You'll also bear the weight of.
I don't need to settle the score,
You are the perpetrator.
You'll judge yourself, you'll never be free.

The cheater never wins,
Even if he ends the game with the highest score.
And the liar never knows love,
You can't earn that through force.
I know the illusion of power
Just leaves you needing more.
In your loneliest hour,
You'll be haunted by me.
