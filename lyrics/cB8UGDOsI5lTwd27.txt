The acorn on a string was for you,
It was for you and only you,
Relinquished from my hand and I left it,
and it waited for you,

You small one,
We were the greyest of doves
You small one,
We were the greyest of doves

The strong knot was to show you that I cared,
I sent you off into the water there,
The strong knot was to show you that i cared,
I sent you off into the water there,

into the water there
into the water there
into the water there
into the water there
into the water there
into the water there
into the water there

Every now and then I take a peek,
I breath it in, I breath it in deep,
Every now and then I take a peek,
I breath it in, I breath it in deep
