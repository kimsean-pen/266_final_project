Salt, pepper, ketchup and hot sauce
Fry hard cause I do not like soft
My niggas shine with the lights off
Here go some swag you can bite off
Salt, pepper, ketchup and hot sauce
Fry hard cause I do not like soft
My niggas shine with the lights off
Here go some swag you can bite off
Yeah, yeah, yum, yum, wait
Open wide, look at God, homicides
I'm not perfect but I improvise
Drop shit and my niggas vibe
Endless nights I cried when Julito died
My city needs me I promised I wouldn't fail'em
If you love somebody I promise that you should tell 'em
And buyin' what you're selling, pockets swelling
Sellin' white, showin' off, feeling like I'm Ellen
Salt, pepper, ketchup and hot sauce
Fry hard cause I do not like soft
