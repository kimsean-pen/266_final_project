It's words you forget to anniversary songs
Bottles bite back your tolerance wrong
Your good intentions count for little anymore
If you're sorry why wage war?

I'm not fully convinced
That something wrong with this
Could another point of view biased and untrue
Tear me away from you

Will you be my valentine
If I'm a world away
Apologies are breaking me
Constants aren't so constant anymore

Two days I wait for calls
To come through
Tonight for me translates
Yesterday to you

Bend and you wave you're barely away
Wish I could say tonight
When you bend and wave goodbye
You'd take me with you

Will you be my valentine
If I'm a world away
Apologies are breaking me
The constants aren't so constant anymore
The constants aren't so constant anymore

Will you be my valentine
Will you be my valentine
If I'm a world away, if I'm a world away
The constants aren't so constant anymore
