Baby, baby, I know you like to turn the line
If you're fed up, I can come and occupy
Let's get crazy, Let's get into trouble tonight
Oh I
Like the danger, dancing on the upper hand
Kiss some strangers, jump and don't care where I land
If you're ready, I can show you something tonight
That's right

And you
Can't deny it
You know you're such a good boy, good boy
I want to make you my toy, my toy

I want to mess with you
I can't hide it
Ooh, you're such a good boy, good boy
How can I make you my toy, my toy

Baby, Baby, I can feel you apprehend
You ain't waiting, boy then you can fake pretend
Fake it till you make it then we'll do it again
Amen
Break the rules let's, do something we never do
Inhibitions, only thing we're going to lose
You might like it, baby if you give it a try
That's right

And you
Can't deny it (Can't deny it)
You know you're such a good boy, good boy
I want to make you my toy, my toy

I want to mess with you
I can't hide it (I can't hide it)
Ooh, you're such a good boy, good boy
How can I make you my toy, my toy

I want to mess with you
Can't deny it
You know you're such a good boy, good boy
I want to make you my toy, my toy

I want to mess with you
I can't hide it
Ooh, you're such a good boy, good boy
How can I make you my toy, my toy

I want to mess with you
I want to mess with you
I want to mess with you
I want to mess with you
