I stay in my dreams
But I don't know what that means
Are you real or am I?
You tell yourself to take it slow
But there's only one place to go
We all have a way to get high

I run towards the fantasy
Oh the places I would rather be
They seem like heaven inside my head
For just a moment I had myself
Unrestrained, and the drinking helps
The burn feels like an old friend returned from the dead

I stay in my dreams
But I don't know what that means
Are you real or am I?
You tell yourself to take it slow
But there's only one place to go
We all have a way to get high

I wonder if I'll ever know
The person that I love the most
The person I spent my life to protect
Reactions of loved ones so dear
Convulsing from the words that they hear
Don't ever let your guard down
Leave nothing to neglect

I built this world to escape from yours
Call it trash, I call it pearls
I've got mine, you keep yours
The creativity is more than vagary
I admit it can get the best of me
But at least there I'm free

The blood beneath your skin
(It's the waking)
The blush of embarrassment
(That you just can't take)
From seeing how a person is made
(And the day feels like you've set yourself on fire)

Run from the questions you have
(You have freedom)
They never answered once when you asked
(The truth will set you free)
But now you're the sickness and they are clean
(If you're honest with yourself)

So just pretend it's a dream
(Don't wake up)
Just pretend it's a dream
(And it's your life)
Just pretend it's a dream
