Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know there's no respite for me -
even the worm that never dies has left
I've never been so exhausted - I think I'll go to bedlam
I'm walking through the mud knee deep
in blood and I just realized where I'm
Heading...
On a one-way trip down SATAN PLACE
Is this purgatory necessary?
I'm wearing a suit of tar and feathers
The fallen angel they could never bury
I'm knock knock knock knockin' on death's door
Do you remember where you've seen this cadaver before?
This swan-song's floating on a watery grave
BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT BABY!!!
(I'm on a one-way trip down SATAN
PLACE/I'm on a one-way trip down SATAN PLACE)
If I had a soul I'd go to heaven because I've been living through hell
My alarm clock every morning is an eternal tolling bell
The two headed dog's been chewing my leg off for seven hundred years
Three wise-guy monkeys on my back, roaches in my eyes and ears
I'm on a one-way trip down SATAN PLACE
Is this purgatory necessary
I'm wearing a suit of tar and feathers
The fallen angel they could never bury
I'm KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK knockin' on death's door
Do you remember where you've seen this cadaver before?
This swan-song's floating on a watery grave
BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT BABY!!!
{I'm on a one-way down SATAN PLACE/I'm on a one-way down SATAN PLACE)
.SURF'S UP!...
Dancing to the pipes of pandemonium, second on the left after the
Botttomless pit
My death's given birth to a live beyond worth
I'm gonna ride the wild surf in the bowels of the earth
I'm HANGIN' TEN! on the final tidal wave in hell
I'm the last surfer in HELL (He's the last surfer in hell!)
I'm the last surfer in HELL (He's the last surfer in hell!)
I'm the LAST SURFER IN HELL!!! COWABUNGA!!!
I'm on a one-way trip down SATAN PLACE

I'm KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCKIN' on DEATH'S DOOR
Do you remember where you've SEEN this CADAVER before?

BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT BABY!!!
