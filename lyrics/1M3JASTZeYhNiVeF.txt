There's something on my mind
But I don't want to talk about it
I'm saying my goodbyes
Though we haven't begun to party
Oh baby, it's all a catastrophe
Oh lover, it's not how it used to be
I'm just a man who's battling with his mind
(I'm just a man who's battling with his mind)
One hundred and eight battles within the mind
Minds forever changing what you began
Life's a waste of time
It's just a waste of time
Minds forever changing what you began
Battle with your mind
There's magic in my eyes
But I don't want to look into it
There's thunder in the skies and
I'm frightened of what it's doin'
Oh baby, it's all a catastrophe
Oh lover, it's not how it used to be
I'm just a man who's battling with his mind
(I'm just a man who's battling with his mind)
One hundred and eight battles within the mind
Minds forever changing what you began
Life's a waste of time
It's just a waste of time
Minds forever changing what you began
Battle with your mind, ha haa
Oh baby, it's all a catastrophe
Oh lover, it's not how it used to be
I'm just a man who's battling with his mind
(I'm just a man who's battling with his mind)
One hundred and eight battles within the mind
(Within the mind)
Haa
There is somebody out there
Please I want you to help me
