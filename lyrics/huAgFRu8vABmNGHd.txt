Take me down
I want to stay
In your arms
I want to pray

Lean on me
Into my chest
Hear me breathe
Watch me undress
For you

Your love is holy
Above, below me
I see you running out
You see me running out
Of time

Into one
Our hearts connect
Like a song
That has no end

Lean on me
When it's a mess
You can sleep
While I protect you

Your love is holy
Above, below me
I see you running out
You see me running out
Of time

I see you running out
You see me running out
Of time
