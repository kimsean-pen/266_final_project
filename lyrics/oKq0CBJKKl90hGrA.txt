This place is a hole
But I don't wanna go
I wish we could stay here forever alone
This time that we waste
But I still love your taste
Don't let him take my place
Don't just sit there

Sometimes I wish you would leave me
Whoa I'm not sick of you yet
Is that as good as it gets?
I'll just hide it
I could slip into you
It's so easy to come back into you

I stayed for a while
And waited for words
Seen but not heard
And struggled to try
My tongues turnin' black
But I'll take you back
You're still the best more or less
I guess
I guess

Don't you leave me
Whoa I'm not sick of you yet
Is that as good as it gets?
I'll just hide it oh
I could slip into you
It's so easy to come back into you

And it hurts me to say that it hurts me to stay
And it might be alright if you go
It hurts me to say that I want you to stay

But it might be alright if you go
So leave me
Whoa I'm not sick of you yet
Is that as good as it gets?
I'll just hide it whoa

I could slip into you
It's so easy to come...
Back into you
Sometimes i think that the bitter in you
And the quitter in me
Is the bitter in you
And the quitter in me
The bitter in you
And the quitter in me
Is the bitter in you
And the quitter in me
The bitter in you
And the quitter in me is (yeah)
Is better than the both of us
