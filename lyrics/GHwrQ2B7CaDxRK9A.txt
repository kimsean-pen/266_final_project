I'll say, you were so beautiful that day
I'll try, to get it signed
If ever, you'll ever stop
Don't fake it
Don't turn me down
Overdriver
Everyplace the way will go
Overdriver
Super duper perfect smiles

I'll stop, from a world if I come up on top
But surely... (ness?)
Your sugar kiss so sweet
Why can't you be
Like you used to be to me
I need you now, because I love you still
Overdriver
I hate you now, because I love you still
Overdriver
Somehow forever, I guess I always will
