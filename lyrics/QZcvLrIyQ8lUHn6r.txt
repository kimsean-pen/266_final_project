There's gotta be a better way
to let this be told
Don't know why you wanna stay
when I act so cold
Drop my thoughts alone
I never had my own
'Cause I'm lost inside
I wanna fall into paradise

It's killing me, killing me
I got this far on my own
Just colour me, colour me
I'm so afraid
Underneath all of the mess that I have made

I don't wanna fade away, let it slip off my tongue
What's another day awake with a twist in my lungs?
Drown in doubts alone, I've always had my own
'Cause I'm lost inside
Someone take me home

It's killing me, killing me
I got this far on my own
Just colour me, colour me
I'm so afraid
Underneath all of the mess that I have made

Try to find my way around the honest answers
It's killing me just living in the mess I made
I fell into a river of all my own disasters and
Wash away the worst and leave me clean

It's killing me, killing me
I got this far on my own
Just colour me, colour me
I'm so afraid
Underneath all of the mess that I have made
