Dark stone in space
Spins in place
Behind the glass
Inside the case
I got it to stay
I found out the way
Beyond all time
Below the caves
I hold your shape
I got it to stay
I saw your mind
It looked like your face
Two names that begin the same
Two hands that feel in the waves
One time there under the arc light
All time there was in one place
