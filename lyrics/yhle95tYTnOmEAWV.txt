Bone
Hands and Toes, Feet and Head
Carrion to be fed
Well, any dog can chew over my bone
And all my words, well, they turn into blood
When my name's called, I am just a pile of bone
(Unintelligible???)
(Unintelligible???)
What could be inside my head?
Bone
Fingernails, chest, and feet
Carrion, good to eat
Any dog can chew over my bone
And all my words gonna turn into blood
When my gun's shot, I am just a pile of bone
(Unintelligible???)
(Unintelligible???)
What could be inside my head?
Will all the stitches be unsewn?
If heaven is a place I know,
I won't get to keep my bones
Bone
Heaven is a place I know
I won't get to keep my bones
Will all the stitches be unsewn?
(Unintelligible???)
(Unintelligible???)
What will be inside my head?
Bone
