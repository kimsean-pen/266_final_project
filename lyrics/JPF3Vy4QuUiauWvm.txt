Taking it slow isn't easy, if as far as you go
Is only half as far as you and I both know, yeah
Coming up from above, a little something
And it's only because I don't ever wanna see you in love
But I know

That you've been coming off strong lately
And I can feel it there
You been thinking that maybe you got a, another shot at me
Thinking possibly somehow, but not now

And it's been spinning around like a hurricane
And the sound of the thunder
That's beating my head to the ground
But I, I know

That I can't go back to this, to her
To what we used to have
It's black and burnt
My God, this is so sad
It will only make things worse
If we bring it back, woah yeah yeah

Now I mean, if you believe
That there is something still between you and me
Then baby, honestly yeah
You're not the one for me

And I can't go back to this, to her
To what we used to have
It's black and burnt
My God, this is so sad
It will only make things worse
If we bring it back
If we bring it back, yeah oh
If we bring it back, yeah yeah ohh
If we bring it back
If we bring it back
