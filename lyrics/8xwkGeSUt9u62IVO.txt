Thought I saw you, on the road
I was chasing sunsets, all alone

The darkness fading, painting, goodbye pink sky
Far away but dreaming of your ocean eyes

Thought I saw you, on the road
I was chasing sunsets, all alone

The darkness fading, painting, goodbye pink sky
Far away but dreaming of your ocean eyes

Thought I saw you, on the road
I was chasing sunsets, all alone

The darkness fading, painting, goodbye pink sky
Far away but dreaming of your ocean eyes
