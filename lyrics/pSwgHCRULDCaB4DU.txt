Hotels are made for two-night stays
Checkin' in and out
Meetin' strangers in the lobby
Wakin' up and leavin' town the next day
But love ain't

And whiskey's poured for when you're bored
And alone on Friday night
When you wanna lose yourself
And need a place to hide from all the pain
But love ain't

Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you callin' me 'cause he ain't pickin' up his phone
The way you're talkin', sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is, girl
But I know what love ain't

Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

Sad movies are for cryin'
On the couch there in the dark
That sad song, it was written
Just to try and get your heart to break
But love ain't

Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you callin' me 'cause he ain't pickin' up his phone
The way you're talkin', sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is, girl
But I know what love ain't

Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

Love ain't
Wonderin' what he's doin'
Love ain't
Feelin' like a fool and
You can't
Keep lettin' him do it to you

'Cause love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you callin' me 'cause he ain't pickin' up his phone
The way you're talkin', sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is, girl
But I know what love ain't
I may not know what love is, girl
But I know what love ain't

Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't
Love ain't
Love ain't
