I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around

Ooh baby, when I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Oh darling, I can't stand it
When you look at me that way

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down (sky tumbling down)
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around

Ooh darling when you're near me
And you tenderly call my name
Oh, I know that my emotions
Are something I just can't tame
I just got to have you baby
No, no, no
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down (sky tumbling down)
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, tumbling down
I just lose control
Down to my very soul
I get hot and cold
All over, all over, all over, all over

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
Tumbling down
Tumbling down
Tumbling down
Tumbling down
Tumbling down
Tumbling down
