This is my city now
An alien city
I will exploit it all
And bend it to my needs
Much like the locust you are
Consuming everything
Deplete and find another target
You have no idea what you brought in
To never be good enough for you
But nothing was ever good enough for you

HEAR ME OUT; IF IT WAS A GAME WHO'S THE WINNER NOW?
YOU KNOW, CAUSE I FAIL TO SEE IF THERE'S REALLY ONE AT ALL
(FEELS LIKE DIVING) FACE FORWARD INTO A SOLID BRICK WALL

You have launched me
Into eternity
Hate was always my trade
Until I met you
It has found its way back
For that you'll get full credit
We had a mission and you failed it
Bringing down the team
To never be good enough for you

HEAR ME OUT; IF IT WAS A GAME WHO'S THE WINNER NOW?
YOU KNOW, CAUSE I FAIL TO SEE IF THERE'S REALLY ONE AT ALL
(FEELS LIKE DIVING) FACE FORWARD INTO A SOLID BRICK WALL
THIS IS A CASE OF MY DARKNESS VERSUS YOUR INSTABILITY
(AND) THERE'S NO JUDGE, JURY, ATTORNEY OR LAWYER
THAT CAN EVER SOLVE IT

This is for the nights I waited on you
This is for the fortune I wasted on us
And this is for giving up my entire life, just to be with you
But the saddest part of it all
Is that I would do it all again, given the chance
Have no illusions, I still think you are a coward
Who gave up the fight, instead of gritting one's teeth and pulling through
To never be good enough for you
But nothing was ever good enough for you

HEAR ME OUT; IF IT WAS A GAME WHO'S THE WINNER NOW?
YOU KNOW, CAUSE I FAIL TO SEE IF THERE'S REALLY ONE AT ALL
(FEELS LIKE DIVING) FACE FORWARD INTO A SOLID BRICK WALL
THIS IS A CASE OF MY DARKNESS VERSUS YOUR INSTABILITY
(AND) THERE'S NO JUDGE, JURY, ATTORNEY OR LAWYER
THAT CAN EVER SOLVE IT

Only thing worse than the worst day
Is the worst day revisited
The same dagger is buried in my spine
But different people keep twisting it
Soon you're going to need a bigger knife
To effectively damage me
But I'm proud of who I am, and of what I've become
The King of Clubs
