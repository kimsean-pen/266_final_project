You will find me if you want me in the garden
unless it's pouring down with rain
You will find me if you want me in the garden
unless it's pouring down with rain
You will find me if you want me in the garden
unless it's pouring down with rain
You will find me if you want me in the garden
unless it's pouring down with rain

You will find me if you want me in the garden
unless it's pouring down with rain
You will find me if you want me in the garden
unless it's pouring down with rain
You will find me if you want me in the garden

You will find me waiting for spring and summer
You will find me waiting for the fall
You will find me waiting for the apples to ripened
You will find me waiting for them to fall
You will find me by the banks of all four rivers
You will find me at the spring of conciousness
You will find me if you want me in the garden
unless it's pouring down with rain

You will find me if you want me in the garden
unless it's pouring down with rain
You will find me if you want me in the garden
unless it's pouring down with rain
You will find me if you want me in the garden
unless it's pouring down with rain
You will find me if you want me in the garden
