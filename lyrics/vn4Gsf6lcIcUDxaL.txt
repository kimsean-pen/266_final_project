There's so much on my mind
I don't know where to start
There's that light in your eye filling up the dark
Though, I lost myself
I know it's not the end
You're my shooting star
You make my heart ascend

La, la, la...
Just levitate, just levitate
La, la, la...
Just levitate, just levitate

I know that we're far from where we need to be
But the world wasn't made in just one day
Though our journey's long, I know our love is strong
You're my shooting star
We're flying high above

La, la, la...
Just levitate, just levitate
La, la, la...
Just levitate, just levitate
La, la, la...
Just levitate, just levitate
La, la, la...
Just levitate, just levitate

When I'm stuck in the middle of hell and faith
And I don't know where to turn
To bend my mind as the silver gate
You lead me on my way

La, la, la...
Just levitate, just levitate
La, la, la...
Just levitate, just levitate
La, la, la...
Just levitate, just levitate
La, la, la...
Just levitate, just levitate

Just levitate, just levitate
Just levitate, just levitate
