It's no secret I've been waiting
but I didn't expect this
Nothing will remain,
nothing stays the same
after you came

It's no secret I've been starving,
I never felt anything for years
I sat up all night
just to watch your smile
when you're sleep'ng

I was so lucky you came by
and turned a different corner
I could've been somewhere else,
you could've passed by,
could've passed by

Come on and sail the sea with me
Come on, let's go around the world
Maybe find a flat or a canyon house
for the season

I was so lucky you came by
and turned a different corner
It could've been someone else
you had in mind

I was so lucky you found me
My rags turned gold and silver
I could've been somewhere else,
you could've passed by,
could've passed by

What would you make of this, my baby?
The sun through the trees
Is there a better place to be?

I was so lucky you came by
and turned a different corner
It could have been someone else
you had in mind, oh my

I was so lucky you picked me
My trash turned to silver Yea,
I could have been somewhere else,
you could've passed by,
you could've passed by
