There was a summer breeze
All things a blurry dream
In the shade of the tree
There's no more lucky clover
It's the last September ever
If you fall in love with me
So who's your mama now?
Now that it's all over
'Cause you've got to set me free
Oh, you've got to set me free Shadow in a thicket
A dog sounding yonder
Barks a bother
Windy Christian music tickling a-lofty
Hear the seashells chatter
The black berriless makes a mutter
We're all searching for our mother
Broken hearted brother
Bloody nose, toes, horse hoof and thunder
I'm standing in the open
I'm wondering where I am now
A solitary soldier saluting heavenwards and nothing
The tiny song of bramble
You know her amble movements
She's been here now forever
Mother nature clever
So who's your daddy now?
Now that it's all over
There's no more lucky clover
It's the last September ever

There's no more lucky clover
It's the last September ever
So who's your daddy now?

There was a summer breeze
All things a blurry dream
In the shade beyond the tree
There's no more lucky clover
It's the last September ever
If you fall in love with me
So who's your mama now?
Now that it's all over
'Cause you've got to set me free
Oh, you've got to set me free What happened to the old tire swing?
Swung too many swungses
Oh burned-out foxhole of childhood longing
Yearning for the summer
School will soon be over
There ain't nothing to kiss but a bull frog and a horse hoof
Pile of dung
Cracked out and bee stung
Rainwater flow through the money tracks
Tractor tracks tire tracks
I hear footsteps the ghosts of cats
Might be that old tom who got murdered by the nurse
Who rides that old motorcrycle?
Maybe someone young and virile
I want a cup of tea so bad it's making my wood...
Get hold of yourself, Grandpa!
Do you want to take me beachcombing, world roaming?
Do you want to be my partner?

There was a summer breeze
All things a blurry dream
In the shade of the tree
There's no more lucky clover
It's the last September ever
If you fall in love with me
So who's your mama now?
Now that it's all over
'Cause you've got to set me free
Oh, you've got to set me free Oh, you've got to set me free, set me free
Oh you've got to, you've to, set me free, set me free
