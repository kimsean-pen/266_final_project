Time kills, go ask Jesus
I'm done, makes no difference
Stare straight, stare at the sun
I'm done, makes no difference

Time takes us all
So why am I not just living for today?
Time takes us, time takes us all
Will I die right now, I'm only seconds away
Time takes us

Move on, gone forever
I'm done, makes no difference
Poison, time kills slowly
You're done, makes no difference

Time takes us all
So why am I not just living for today?
Time takes us, time takes us all
Will I die right now, I'm only seconds away
Time takes us

Time will now be
Time will now be
Time will now be
Time will now be the chopping block
Leave my head

Time kills, makes no difference
I'm done, makes no difference
Makes no difference

Time takes us all
So why am I not just living for today?
Time takes us, time takes us all
Will I die right now, it could be seconds away
Time takes us all
