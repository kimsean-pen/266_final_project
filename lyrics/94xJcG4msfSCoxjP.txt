Whip, whip, whip
Whip, whip, whip
Whip, whip, whip
Whip like that
Whip, whip, whip
Whip
Whip like that
Whip like that
Whip like that

We suffer everyday, what is it for?
These crowns of illusion are fooling us all
And now I am weary and I feel like I do

It's only you
Who can tell me apart
And it's only you
Who can turn my wooden heart

The size of our fight, it's just a dream
We've crushed everything
I can see in this mornin' selfishly
How we've failed and I feel like I do

It's only you
Who can tell me apart
And it's only you
Who can turn my wooden heart

Whip, whip, whip
Whip, whip, whip
Whip like that
Whip, whip, whip
Whip, whip, whip
Whip, whip, whip
Whip like that
Whip like that
Whip like
Whip like
Whip like that

Now that we've chosen to take all we can
This shade of autumn, a stale bitter end
Years of frustration lay down side by side

And it's only you
Who can tell me apart
And it's only you
Who can turn my wooden heart

It's only you
Who can tell me apart
And it's only you
Who can turn my wooden heart
