I remember the days
Of just keeping time
Of hanging around in sleepy towns, forever
Back roads empty for miles

Well you can't have a dream
And cut it to fit
But when I saw you, I knew
We go together, like a wink and a smile

Leave your old jalopy
By the railroad track
We'll get a hip, double dip, tip toppy
2 seat Pontiac

So you can rev her up
Don't go slow
It's only green lights and alright
Let's go together, with a wink and a smile

Give me a wink and a smile

We go together like a wink and a smile

Now my heart is music
Such a simple song
Singing again, the notes never end
This is where I belong

Just the sound of your voice
The light in your eyes
You're so far away from yesterday
Together, with a wink and a smile

We go together, like a wink and a smile
