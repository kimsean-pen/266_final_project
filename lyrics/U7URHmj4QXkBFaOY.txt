I should be standing at the bar, waving a ten pound note around
But I sit here on the sofa at my girls house
I should be chatting shit as I'm nobbing out another stout
But I'll roach a spliff watching the TV for now
I should be watching the fruit machines for which one will pay out
But I sit on the sofa at my girls, anyhow
I should be legging it from a cab, like a mad little lout
But Ill roach a spliff, watching the TV throughout

I know I never tell her, but every single day man
Im always thinking loads about her
She's the best thing that ever happened to me and
I dont know what I'd do without her

I should actually go out and about, flip some beer mats
Instead of sitting here at my girls gaff
Cos all I seem to do is sit in this habitat
Just roaching a spliff watching the TV and that
On the TV at my house, theres a bit broken at the back
So I use my girls TV to watch the match
Yeah, I might head out later to get off this beaten track
Of watching the TV, roaching up on the same old mat

I know I never tell about every single day man
Im always thinking loads about her
She's the best thing that ever happened to me and
I dont know what I'd do without her

But on second thoughts I wont do shots, no I think I will
Sit on the sofa and eat my TV meal
I would actually much prefer to just sit here and chill
Roaching a spliff, watching Eastenders or The Bill
Cos basically, I love her and I love been here still
And I love sitting on the sofa with my girl, for real
I dont wanna knock my mates, but there is the same old drill
Roaching a spliff, watching the TV is my will

I know I never tell about every single day man
Im always thinking loads about her
She's the best thing that ever happened to me and
I dont know what I'd do without her

No fuck that, I might ask my mates where theyll be drinking
From the sofa giving them a ding
Tell em, I will go threes on that gram later on this evening
Instead of roaching a spliff, watching the TV again
And then go out, whilst back at hers, she does her ting
Sitting on the sofa at her end
But as I watch the big screen I know I will quite miss
Me and her, roaching a spliff, watching the TV again

I know I never tell about every single day man
Im always thinking loads about her
She's the best thing that ever happened to me and
I dont know what I'd do without her

I've got one packet of rizla over there, and it's nearly run out.
I've got bits of cigarette all over the place
The clipper needs a shake, the ashtray needs emptying
But i wouldn't have it any other way
