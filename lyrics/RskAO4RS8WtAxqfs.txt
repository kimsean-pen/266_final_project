Bake up, when I wake up
Make you oatmeal, hope you stay
No I'm not sorry for make up
It's not here to stay
Bake up, when I wake up
Make you oatmeal, hope you stay
No I'm not sorry for make up
It's not here to stay

Wake up
If you want some oatmeal, I got you
Wake up
If you want some oatmeal, I got you

I'm not trying to force you into something not true
It's just lonely sometimes
It's not even sunrise
I'm not trying to force you into something not true
I've got plenty of lives
But no god on my side

Wake up
If you want some oatmeal, I got you
Wake up
If you want some oatmeal, I got you
