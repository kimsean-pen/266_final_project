Hark how the bells
sweet silver bells
all seem to say
throw cares away

Christmas is here
bringing good cheer
to young and old
meek and the bold

Ding dong ding dong
that is their song
With joyful ring
all carolling

One seems to hear
words of good cheer
from eveywhere
filling the air

Oh how they pound
raising the sound
o'er hill and dale
telling their tale
Gaily they ring
while people sing
songs of good cheer
Christmas is here
Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria

Hark how the bells
sweet silver bells
all seem to say
throw cares away

Christmas is here
bringing good cheer
to young and old
meek and the bold

Ding dong ding dong
that is their song
With joyful ring
all carolling

One seems to hear
words of good cheer
from eveywhere
filling the air

Oh how they pound
raising the sound
o'er hill and dale
telling their tale

Gaily they ring
while people sing
songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria
Gaily they ring
while people sing
songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

Hark how the bells
sweet silver bells
all seem to say
throw cares away

Christmas is here
bringing good cheer
to young and old
meek and the bold

Ding dong ding dong
that is their song
With joyful ring
all carolling

One seems to hear
words of good cheer
from eveywhere
filling the air

Oh how they pound
raising the sound
o'er hill and dale
telling their tale
Gaily they ring
while people sing
songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

Gaily they ring
while people sing
songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

Hark how the bells
sweet silver bells
all seem to say
throw cares away

Christmas is here
bringing good cheer
to young and old
meek and the bold

Ding dong ding dong
that is their song
With joyful ring
all carolling

One seems to hear
words of good cheer
from eveywhere
filling the air

Oh how they pound
raising the sound
o'er hill and dale
telling their tale
Gaily they ring
while people sing
songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

Gaily they ring
while people sing
songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
On on they send
on without end
their joyful tone to every home

Ding dong ding dong
That is their song
