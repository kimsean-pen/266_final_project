Get all your strength
Don't slip away
I saw you fall down
Too far from my grasp
I don't know where you're going
Our gazes meet even now
My room is so cold
Your breath is still here. or
It's just my immagination?
Where are you? I search you in this starless night
But you are already too far!
Scream my name, when i can't hear you!
I'm sewing my scars
But I already know you'll not come back.

Gat all your strength
Don't come back again
I saw you fly down
Too far from my paradise
I don't know where you are now
Our eyes are just so blind
My room is so cold
Your spectre's still here. or
It's just my immagination?
Where are you? I search you in this starless night
But you are already too far!
Scream my name, when i can't hear you!
I'm sewing my scars
But I already know you'll not come back.
