Walking in the rain
Walking through the streets
In the dark at nights I might find some peace to think
Cause my mind is on fire

My hair is blowing in the wind
And you are saying something
But I cannot hear a word that's coming out of your sweet mouth
Cause my mind is on fire

:
No, I'm not sorry
I'm not sorry at all
No, I won't apologize although I know that's what you'd like
But I'm not sorry at all

:
You're always bringing out
The very worst in me
The weakest version of a person that I'd ever want to be
But my heart is on fire

:
Ahhh
Ahhh
Ahhh
Ahhh

:
You're so hard to figure out
I don't know what you're wanting
Am I supposed to sacrifice myself to let you free?
But my heart is on fire

:
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
