{Step right up
Step right up, everyone
Whether you're good or bad
Happy or sad}

{Whether you're an emotional wreck
Or a blissful speck in this
Black hole of an existence
We call life}

{Step right up and witness something
You'll be soon to never forget
Feast your ears on the most ferociously
Soothing waves of sonic communication
To ever be created}

{Built for you by the master
Hey!
Built for you by the mast
Hey shut up already, what is it?
What is it?
Uhh, yea dog, what is it?
What is it?
Dude chill man
It is Limp Bizkit}

All around the world you know me
All around the world we know you

All around the world you know me
All around the world we know you
