Gonna jump down, spin around, pick a bale of cotton

On top of old Smokey all covered with snow
I lost my true lover by courting so slow
for courtin's a pleasure and parting is brief
and a false-hearted lover is worse than a thief
on top of old Smokey all covered with snow
I lost my true lover by courting so slow

Well, you wake up in the mornin'
hear the ding-dong ring
you go marchin' to the table
see the same old thing
see the fork on the table
nothing in your pan
if you say a thing about it
you're in trouble with the man

Let the midnight special
shine a light on me
let the midnight special
shine its everlovin' light on me

If you ever go to Houston
well you'd better act right
and you'd better not gamble
and you'd better not fight
for the sheriff will arrest you
and he'll take you down
and before you understand it
you are prison bound

Let the midnight special
shine a light on me
let the midnight special
shine its everlovin' light on me
