You, you were my best friend
You were my everything
So don't leave me now

You, you were the best of me
The reason that I believe
So don't leave me now

And I, tried to keep us alive
But you were cold cold cold
Now every second that my heart skips it ends
But I, still wanna keep us alive
But it's cold cold cold cold

When the music dies
It's all black and white
And there's no sunrise
When the music dies

Now you, you can't even look at me
You say you're not gonna speak to me
Oh oh oh oh

And I, tried to keep us alive
But you were cold cold cold
Now every second that my heart skips it ends
But I, still wanna keep us alive
But it's cold cold cold cold

When the music dies
It get's cold when there's no sunrise
So cold, now every second that my heart skips it ends

And I, tried to keep us alive
Oh but you were cold cold cold
Now every second, my heart beat ends
But I, still wanna keep us, alive
But you were cold cold
Oh... When the music dies
