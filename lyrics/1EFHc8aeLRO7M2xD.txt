My kitty's like a python
Tick-ticking like a timebomb
Limited edition, gotta buy it with no try-on
I purchase like a lion
Knock 'em out like Tyson
Everybody knows that I'm a million dollar diamond

I'm reckless, offensive
I destroy your defences
My guestlist is priceless
And yes, I run a tight ship
Bentleys and Benzys
Threw cashcard in Lenzies
And dollars and senses
Cha-ching

It's expensive to be me
Looking this good don't come for free
Oh bitch what? That's just who I be, it's expensive to be me

I'm like these Georgia peaches
Your magic can't compete with
I change the game, now say my name
"Hi bitch, it's nice to meet, yes"
I texture off the runway, my money origami
I'm whole couture, on a world tour
From Tokyo to Bombay

I'm reckless, offensive
I destroy your defences
My guestlist is priceless
And yes, I run a tight ship
Bentleys and Benzys
Threw cashcard in Lenzies
And dollars and senses
Cha-ching

It's expensive to be me
Looking this good don't come for free
It's expensive to be me
Looking this good don't come for free
Oh bitch what? That's just who I be, it's expensive to be me

I'm gonna spice that club like rock, rock
Them DSLs, like mwah, mwah
Looking at me like snack, snack
Gonna eat this ass like smack, smack
Queens right, now Kings left
Drop down, expensive
And I still don't give a fuck

It's expensive to be me
Looking this good don't come for free
It's expensive to be me
Looking this good don't come for free
Oh bitch what? That's just who I be, it's expensive to be me

That's just who I be, it's expensive to be me
