If came the hour, if came the day
If came the year, when you went away
How could I live, I'd surely die
What would I be if you say goodbye

How would I laugh, how could I love
Could I believe in a God above
How would I hope, how could I pray
If came the hour, if came the day

But you are here, lying beside me
I watch you breath, each rise and fall
Without you here, then there would be
Nothing at all

If in this world, all things must pass
And we must raise, the parting glass
No words would ever come
What could I say
If came the hour, if came the day

There'd be no music in my soul
How could I dance, now you to hold
How could I hear the violin
There'd be no song, I could ever sing

But you are here, lying beside me
I watch you breath, each rise and fall
Without you here, then there would be
Nothing at all

Now you awake, the dawn sweeps in
I touch your mouth, I touch your skin
How would I live, if you should go away
If came the hour, if came the day

How could I live, if you should go away
If came the hour, if came the day

If came the hour, if came the day
