with your hands on your ears
i see you reading
and it doesn't even matter
that everyone can see you

in you there is no masquerade
just purity and realness
from head to toe discrepancy
unlike anyone here

in you there is a fire
your warmth shines onto me
i bet you find bestsellers and crimes
exactly as unreadable

in you i see a lighting
and if it struck me i wouldn't mind
you are beautiful because you wear
your dismay in your smile

in you there is no imitation
just a delicate strong mind
and with an attitude like that
i believe you can survive

in you there is a rose
to harm anyone your too shy
but your intentions of revolt
are bursting inside

in you there is a darksome cloud
with a very friendly vibe
a gloomy look is simply
the most soothing in our time

with your hands on your ears
i see you reading
and it doesn't even matter
that everyone can see you

in your face i see happiness
with a shimmer of decline
i bet your bookshelf
looks similar to mine
