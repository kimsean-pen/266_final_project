When you walk, you don't leave tracks
When you talk, they don't talk back
Believing every word you say
But they don't know, they don't don't know

Secrets that you just can't keep
Promises that you made me
You twisted it to suit yourself
But now I know, I know, I know
Everything that I told you
You just smile and then you
Kiss and tell everything I say
Stuck inside your little web

Everybody wants to know, yeah
Lips that lie, caught in your trap
Sold me out and you just laugh
Tell me were friends until the end, yeah

But you don't mean it, don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it, no
I wish that I could take it back
You want it all but you can't have that

People falling at your feet
But they don't know, they don't don't know
You're gonna figure out real soon
The dirty deeds will catch up to you
It's crumbling beneath your feet
But you don't know, you don't don't know
Everything that I told you
You just smile and then you

Kiss and tell everything I say
Stuck inside your little web
Everybody wants to know, yeah
Lips that lie, caught in your trap

Sold me out and you just laugh
Tell me were friends until the end, yeah
But you don't mean it, don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it, no

Everything that I told you
You just smile and then you
Kiss and tell everything I say
Stuck inside your little web
Everybody wants to know, yeah
Lips that lie, caught in your trap
Sold me out and you just laugh
Tell me were friends until the end, yeah
But you
Kiss and tell everything I say
Stuck inside your little web
Everybody wants to know, yeah
Lips that lie, caught in your trap
Sold me out and you just laugh
Tell me were friends until the end, yeah
But you don't mean it, don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it, no
Don't mean it, don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it, no
