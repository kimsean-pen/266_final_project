Oooh, oooooh
You are not alone, anymore
You are not alone at all, at all
'Cause I will be here when the time will come
(When the time will come)
There's nothing to fear, we all move as one
Running from different worlds, you and I will collide
[?] do your spell, you and I will ignite
(We are from different worlds)
Running from different worlds, you and I will collide
[?] do not spell, you and I will ignite

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Running from different worlds, you and I will collide
(We are from different worlds)
[?] do not spell, you and I will ignite
(We are from different worlds)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
(We are from different worlds)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
