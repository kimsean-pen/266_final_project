Don't you ever feel lonely
Baby, I've been lonely my whole life
Girls can be kind of controlling
I wanna be controlled, I think it'd be alright

Everybody thinks I'm joking
If it's funny then hold me while cry all night
Maybe we should watch it slowly
We can figure it out, it's all a great big lie

7:30 in the morning
Feeling stoned in the glow of the streetlight
Sound of car doors gently closing
Baby, I been lonely my whole life

I never noticed the way she had it out for me
I just supposed it's like that for everyone
So understated, we're never friendly anyhow
Just tell me what you want me to do
If you were aimless, I'll be what you were aiming for
If you get anxious I'll put on "Morning, Morning" for you
So overstated, we're never in the moment now

Until we're washed away, child
Until we're washed away, child
Until we're washed away, child
Until we're washed away, child
Until we're washed away, child
