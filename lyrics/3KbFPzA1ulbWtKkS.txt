When the chants have cycled
How can I go wrong?
There will be no eve for adam
If the apples have gone, gone, gone, gone

I need a brand new skin
Incarnated debts
Incarcerated when the deeds are left to purchase
If you could see where I've been

You'd touch the hand that's touching sin
Entity ingredients
A mass of blackened scapes begins
sulfur his field

blanket of rot
Taking everything I've got
Please let me in, in, in
I need a brand new skin

Incarnated debts
Incarcerated when the deeds are left to purchase
If you could see where I've been
You'd touch the hand that's touching sin

Entity ingredient
A mass of blackened scapes begins
Follow me to die
Follow me into oblivion

Follow me to die
Follow me into oblivion
If you could see where I've been
You'd touch the hand that's touching sin

Entity ingredient
A mass of blackened scapes begins
I seem to hide in metal plates
Held together alone don't wait

Hide with me identity
Until we've passed due date
Can't spot through the lens
Bleeding through your sanctuary

Intention accident
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Can't spot through the lens
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Intention accident
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Can't spot through the lens
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Intention accident
Bleeding through your sanctuary
