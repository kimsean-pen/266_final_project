Bismillah

Break
Chu ain't livin' by the G code
What the fuck is fleek though?
Don't ask them - what do he know?
What I forgot is better than whatever they remember
Never mind, I'm off it / It's quiet form
Time to put the temper tantrums to the quiet corner
"HUSH! That's enough" said the ruler
No suckers allowed to break bread or asunder
The daylight lightning and the thunder
The sun, moon and stars and the hunger
Abundance in bundles, blessings and troubles
Towers and tunnels, views and valleys, waves
Then pigs: 'what streets you from, son?'
Planet Earth
And ain't scared of no Mars Attack
What type of bars is that?
Stay off my jack
I'm at they corny riot garments top-5 Dylan-in' on 'em
Superfly slicker top floor eagle diving on 'em
You why a lion homey?
You won't play with my emotions, smokey
Big Chief heart rate/Big beat/B-E-Y/Yasiin
Straightjacket come clean/Big said it was a dream
Now it's a living thing/ We true and living kings

I mean it, I mean
I meant it, I mean
Yasiin and Yasiin in the R-E-D
I mean it, I mean
Original nation/ We pon solid with it I mean
I mean it, I mean
Straightjacket come clean
Yasiin and Yasiin
in the R-E-D
Original nation
We pon solid with with
True and living you know
True and living

Illumi-Narcy
Emergency on Planet Earth
The currency is murder
You a man of worth
They say the date is comin
Drummin that you can't reverse
Watch the banner burn, before the cannon burst
Don't chase an illusion
the Nation Halluci
Hallelujah
Taste of the future
The people that shower
The piss of a coward then face it to shoot ya
Lonely martyrs
Magic carpets
Dirty blankets
Coca-Cola soul controller holy waters
Middle East mode
San Glorious
G code and Babylonian the Orient
My superhero got the people power
Yassin and Yasiin
You should head the hour
