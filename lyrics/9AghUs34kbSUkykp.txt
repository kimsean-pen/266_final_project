A crown, created with divine will
An inﬁnite light of the creator

Through wisdom, from nothingness, a ﬁrst revelation
An unbound ﬂash widespread, sheer cataclysm

A vessel, made of comprehension
To give it grasp, of breadth and depth

Ten Sepiroth – A central state of unity
Ten Sepiroth – Emanations pure creation

Upholding the heavens, saturating the stars
In splendor bright glory, deliverance ascends
Sustaining the cosmos, a maelstrom of spirits
In newborn distress, emblazed sparkling spheres

Loving grace of inspiring vision
Withhold this victory in mere sincerity
To envision the concentric circles
Conscious alone the heretic

Through wisdom, from nothingness, a ﬁrst revelation
An unbound ﬂash widespread, sheer cataclysm
Ten Sepiroth – A central state of unity
Ten Sepiroth – Emanations pure creation
