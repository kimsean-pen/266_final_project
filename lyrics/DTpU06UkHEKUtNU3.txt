Don't promise me to much
No i'd rather you don't
A promise don't mean much to me no more

Be mine, be mine

All the darkness and all the light
In the break of dawn and in the deepest night

Be mine, be mine
Oh baby, hold me close I don't ask for more
Oh baby, hold me close I don't ask for more

This is enough now this is all I need
You don't have to speak just keep me company

Be mine, be mine
Oh baby, hold me close I don't ask for more
Oh baby, hold me close I don't ask for more
Be mine, be mine
