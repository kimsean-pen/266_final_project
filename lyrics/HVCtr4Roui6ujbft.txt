Look inside and you will see
The words are cutting deep inside my brain
On they're burning quickly turning
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane
Yeah, yeah

Raven black is on my track
Please show me how to neutralise the knife
Show to me in surgery
The art of finding words to conquer life, or can try
Yeah, yeah

Ooh baby, I can rock and roll
Ooh baby, get out of my soul

Now the wicked lance I fear
Driven from my heavy mounted brain
Crash course in brain surgery
Stops the bloody knife of love again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
