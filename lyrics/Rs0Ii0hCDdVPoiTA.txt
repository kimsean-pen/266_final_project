Down, chemical sacrament
Blasphemous prayer
Deliver me from this
So serene apocalypse

Just make me fucking numb
Deaf, blind and fucking dumb
Return to sacred sleep

This could be my requiem
And I'll feel no pain
This could be my requiem
But don't bury me too deep

Drain infected brine
Sickened cesspool shell of mine
Strap up the hands of time
And push the soul into the vein

Just make me fucking numb
Deaf, blind and fucking dumb
Return to sacred sleep

This could be my requiem
And I'll feel no pain
This could be my requiem
But don't bury me too deep

Sink, suffer, self destruct
Rise, stronger, reconstruct
Sink, suffer, self destruct
Rise, stronger, reconstruct
Dispose
Discard
Deny
And I will feel no pain
