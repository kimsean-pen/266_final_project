Last night I swallowed liquor and a lighter
and this morning I threw up fire
But it's nothing new
I've been piecing it together and it's got something to do
with every look thrown like a knife across a crowded room
And every slow and quiet car ride I spent drinking in the backseat
Every stupid melody to every stupid song,
and every stupid word that everybody's hanging on

What difference does this difference in age make?
I know how it ends... she'll kill me quick
Call 911, I'm already dead but
Someone should be caught and held responsible for this bloody mess

Last night I fell asleep next to a liar and I woke up with a shiner
And it's all that I remember from a night spent lying on my back with a view
Of a stone white ceiling and the back of your head
And this quiet dark bed feels like the middle of nowhere
And we beat each other up just like we always do
When I'm talking to myself I'd always rather be talking to you

What difference does this difference in age make?
I know how it ends... she'll kill me quick
Call 911, I'm already dead but
Someone should be caught and held responsible for this bloody mess
Call homicide, take the case to court
Cause her lips taste like a loaded gun
I'm her number one chalk outline on the floor

They hung her from the bridge on Monday
The gathering turned to a mob out on the lawn
They dropped her body in the river
School and work returned to normal before long

Call 911, I'm already dead but
someone should be caught and held responsible
for this bloody mess
Call homicide, take the case to court
Cause her lips taste like a loaded gun
I'm her number one chalk outline on the floor
