Descent onto the gold dawn psalm.
Falls Brahmicspine away.
Inbreathe. A truant mind reclaimed.
Liberates.

Revolts through involution rise.
Extol the solar rays.
Rise. Consolidate on winds.
The chariot.

Inverter of the organ sensories.
Breaks dissipating ways.
Bir Akeim. Salutes the Godhead.
Vigilance.

Lazarus.
