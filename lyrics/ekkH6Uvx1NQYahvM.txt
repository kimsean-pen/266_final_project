Come run this way, run this way
Follow, I promise you'll be OK, come this way
Be that way, be that way
Want you, I need you to be OK, what do they know?
I know you're bothered down, oh, you're bothered down
I know I'm trapped, oh yeah, you're trapped

With every time I see you I want to sail away
With every time I see you I want to sail away

Through the night that sounds great
I know it'll be OK, just come this way
Your feet on the dash, you make me crash
See you go flying into the night, forever is past
Do they bother down? Do they bother now?
Oh yeah, you're trapped, oh yeah, you're trapped

With every time I see you I want to sail away
With every time I see you I want to sail away
The lights won't bridge the gap through their holiday
With every time I see you I want to sail away, just sail away
Everytime, now, everytime, now
Anytime, anytime, everytime, now
With every time I see you I want to sail away
With every time I see you I want to sail away
The lights won't bridge the gap through their holiday
With every time I see you I want to sail away, just sail away
