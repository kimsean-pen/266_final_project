When I was young, I was invincible
I found myself not thinking twice
I never thought about no future
It's just a roll of the dice

But the day may come when you've got something to lose
And just when you think you're done paying dues
You say to yourself "Dear God, what have I done?"
And hope it's not too late 'cause tomorrow may never come

Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come.

Yesterday is history
And tomorrow's a mystery
But baby, right now
It's just about you and me

You can run, you can hide just like Bonnie and Clyde
Reach for the sky; I ain't never gonna die
And I thank the Lord for the love that I have found
And hold you tight, 'cause tomorrow may never come.

Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come.

So if you please take this moment
Try if you can to make it last
Don't think about no future
And just forget about the past
And make it last

Reach for the sky 'cause tomorrow may never come
(Reach for the sky, I ain't never going down)
Reach for the sky 'cause tomorrow may never come
(Reach for the sky, I ain't never coming down)
Reach for the sky 'cause tomorrow may never come
(Reach for the sky, I ain't never going down)
