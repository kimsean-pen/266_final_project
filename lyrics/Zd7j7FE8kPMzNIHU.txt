I hear a dead note sounding
among the tones of restlessness
A harmony confounding,
a capture moving in distress.

It keeps me chasing closure,
preventing me from finding peace
it holds me back from leaving
this vicious circle I am in.

I'm becoming what I thought,
what I shouldn't be,
what I fear the most
Let me stay here for a while,
I depend on this, it's my only light.

It feels like I have journeyed
for ages without getting there
The path of endless distance,
the road of comforting despair.

I'm becoming what I thought,
what I shouldn't be,
what I fear the most
Let me stay here for a while,
I depend on this, it's my only light.
