Think I'm from space, my soul fell down
I found the earth, not leavin' now
I know your face, think you fell too
And it's my place now if I got you

Anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere you go
Anywhere you go
Round the universe
I'll be there, I'll be there
Wherever you go
Wherever you go, yeah

Think I'm from space, my soul fell down
I found the earth, not leavin' now
I know your face, think you fell too
And it's my place now if I got you
If I got you

You, Baby
You, Baby

You, Baby
You, Baby

You, Baby
You, Baby

I don't care, I don't care
Wherever you've been
'Cause now you're with me
Floatin' through the night
Feels like we're dancin'
Is this the feelin'
Feelin' of fallin' in love
'Cause I know that we met before babe

Think I'm from space, my soul fell down
I found the earth, not leavin' now
I know your face, think you fell too
And it's my place now if I got you
If I got you

You, Baby
You, Baby

You, Baby
You, Baby

You, Baby
You, Baby

Think I'm from space, my soul fell down
I found the earth, not leavin' now
I know your face, think you fell too
And it's my place now if I got you
If I got you

You, Baby
You, Baby

You, Baby
You, Baby

You, Baby
You, Baby
