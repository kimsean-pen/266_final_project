There's a down town corner
People down town know
And a back-beat rhythm
On the radio

And the girl who listens
To a young mans song
On the block I live on
In the place I'm from

Well, the young man sitting
On the dock of the bay
He took a long-term trip on
A first class plane
Now the whole world listens
To that one mans song
On the block I live on
In the place I'm from

Won't you tell me does it move you?
Does it soothe you?
Does it fill your heart and soul with the
Roots of rock and roll?
Does it move you?
Does it soothe you?
Does it fill your heart and soul with the
Roots of rock and roll?

(Rock and roll)
Ooo, nah
(Rock and roll)
(Rock and roll)

Well, the man in black sits
On a screened in porch
Making birthday wishes
71 almost
You can hear him singing
Chariot, swing low
On the block I live on
In the place I know

Won't you tell me does it move you?
Does it soothe you?
Does it fill your heart and soul with the
Roots of rock and roll?
Does it move you?
Does it soothe you?
Does it fill your heart and soul with the
Roots of rock and roll?

(Rock and roll)
(Rock and roll)
(Rock and roll)

Won't you tell me does it move you?
Does it soothe you?
Does it fill your heart and soul with the
Roots of rock and roll?
Does it move you?
Does it soothe you?
Does it fill your heart and soul with the
Roots of rock and roll?

Listen to it
