Does someone have your baby now
Does someone flame your fire and day
Count your skies in the dark
And turns your head around
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake

Does someone know your smile and laugh
Does someone send [?]
Spins your world around
And I'll lose the right thing as well

I don't wanna get it on with you
Don't wanna get it on

Does someone have your baby now
Does someone flame your fire and day
Count your skies in the dark
And turns your head around

I don't wanna get it on with you
Don't wanna get it on
