And after three days of drinking with Larry Love
I just get an inkling to go on home
So I'm walking down Coldharbour Lane
And head hung low
Three or four in the mornin'
The sun's coming up and the birds are out singin'
I let myself into my pad
Wend my way up that spiral staircase
And stretch out nice on the Chesterfield

Pithecanthropus Erectus already on the CD player
And I just push that remote button to sublimity
And listen to the sweet sculptural rhythms of Charles Mingus
And J.R. Monterose and Jackie McLean duet on those saxophones
And the sound makes its way out the window
Minglin' with the traffic noises outside, you know
And all of a sudden I'm overcome by a feelin' of brief mortality

Cause I'm gettin' on in the world
Comin' up on forty-one years
Forty-one stony gray steps towards the grave
You know the box awaits its grisly load
Now I'm gonna be food for worms

And just like Charles Mingus wrote that beautiful piece of music 'Epitaph' for Eric Dolphy
I say, so long Eric
So long John Coltrane and Charles Mingus
So long Duke Ellington and Lester Young
So long Billie Holliday and Ella Fitzgerald
So long Jimmy Reed
So long Muddy Waters
And so long Howlin' Wolf

(Woke up this mornin')
Woke up this mornin'
Got yourself a gun
Your mama always said you'd be the Chosen One
She said, "You're one in a million
You got to burn to shine"
But you were born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in your eyes

And you woke up this mornin'
All that love had gone
Your Papa never told you about right and wrong
Hey but you're, but you're looking good, baby
I believe that you're a-feelin' fine
Shame about it
Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes
So sing it now

(Woke up this mornin')
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Woke up this mornin'
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

(Woke up this mornin')
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Woke up this mornin'
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

I see ya, ya woke up this mornin'
The world turned upside down
Lord above, things ain't been the same
Since the blues walked into town
Hey but you're, but you're, one in a million
Cause you got that shotgun shine
Shame about it
Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes
So sing it now

(Woke up this mornin')
You got a blue moon
(Got a blue moon in your eyes)
So sad
Goddamn, a God damned shame about it
(Woke up this mornin')
You got a blue moon
Got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah
(Got a blue moon in your eyes)
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Mister D. Wayne Love

When you woke up this morning everything was gone
By half past ten your head was going ding-dong
Ringin' like a bell from your head down to your toes
Like some voice tryin'a tell ya there's somethin' you should know

Last night you was flyin' but today you're so low
Ain't it times like these makes you wonder if you'll ever know
The meaning of things as they appear to the others
Wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers

Don't you wish you didn't function, don't you wish you didn't think
Beyond the next pay check and the next little drink
Well you do so make up your mind to go on
'Cause when you woke up this mornin' everything you had was gone

(Woke up this mornin')
When ya woke up this mornin'

(Woke up this mornin')
Ya woke up this mornin'

(Woke up this mornin')
You wanna be, you wanna be the Chosen One
Yeah you know it 'cause
You just can't help yourself, yeah

(Woke up this mornin')
When ya, woke up this mornin'

(Woke up this mornin')
Woke up this mornin'

(Woke up this mornin')
Got yourself a gun
Got yourself a gun
Got yourself a gun
