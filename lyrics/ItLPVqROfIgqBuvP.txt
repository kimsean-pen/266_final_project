We could talk all night long
If we knew each other
I could be personally your beloved other
If we knew each other
If we knew each other
If we knew each other
If we, if we knew each other

(Boo hoo
Boo hoo
Boo hoo

Boo hoo)
But you can't see me,
we're holding each other
We don't have to sense it
When we kiss one other
But you can't see me,
we're holding each other
We don't have to sense it
When we kiss one other
(We could talk all night long
If we knew each other
I could be personally your beloved other
If we knew each other)
If we knew each other

If we knew each other
If we, if we knew each other

(Boo hoo
Boo hoo
Boo hoo
Boo hoo)
