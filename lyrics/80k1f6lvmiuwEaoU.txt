I ain't lookin' to compete with you
Beat or cheat or mistreat you
Simplify you, classify you, deny, defy or crucify you
All I really want to do is, baby, be friends with you

No, and I ain't lookin' to fight with you
Frighten you or uptighten you
Drag you down or drain you down, chain you down or bring you down
All I really want to do is, baby, be friends with you

I ain't lookin' to block you up
Shock or knock or lock you up
Analyze you, categorize you, finalize you or advertise you
All I really want to do is, baby, be friends with you

I don't want to straight-face you
Race or chase you, track or trace you
Or disgrace you or displace you or define you or confine you
All I really want to do is, baby, be friends with you

I don't want to meet your kin
Make you spin or do you in
Or select you or dissect you or inspect you or reject you
All I really want to do is, baby, be friends with you

I don't want to fake you out
Take or shake or forsake you out
I ain't lookin' for you to feel like me, see like me or be like me
All I really want to do is, baby, be friends with you
