We used to dream that we could fly
Like the birds fly
We used to say that we could burn
Like fires through the night

Now all this confusion
I used to make you laugh, now I'm making you cry
Oh, come on baby
We're like shining gold, you and I

We said we'd leave it for a while
To give me time, to give you time
But what good would it do me
When you're the only real in life

Oh, I wanna love you
Let me start again tonight
Oh, come on baby
We're like shining gold, you and I

Oh oh oh, let me
Let me love you again
And I, I, I'll let you
Let you love me again

Oh, take me downtown
My baby's waiting there
Oh, roll down the window
Let me feel the breeze in my hair
(Turn up the volume)
Oh, our song has filled the air
I've got five missed calls and no time to lose
Tonight we will be brand new

Oh, I'm letting myself go
Into the world's of the weekend crowd
And if I squint my eyes
Oh, the city looks like sea fire

I hear some people fighting
It seems she's been with someone else
Oh, but we, we're not like them
The games, the games they play

No, no, no, no
Oh, take me downtown
My baby's waiting there
Oh, roll down the window
Let me feel the breeze in my hair
(Turn up the volume)
Oh, our song has filled the air
I've got five missed calls and no time to lose
Tonight we will be brand new

(We are a brand new love
We will awaken
Born on a thousand sparks
The sun has awakened)

Oh, take me downtown
My baby's waiting there
Oh, roll down the window
Let me feel the breeze in my hair
(Turn up the volume)
Oh, our song has filled the air
I've got five missed calls and no time to lose
Tonight we will be brand new
