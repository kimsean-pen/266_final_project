You're cutting close, I've run dry
We're one of the things that can't die
If you lie to yourself, it's still a lie
You can't live all the time

You're killing me, you're not feeling me
It's unfamiliar inside, inside
On repeat, you see, she is incomplete
You're never going to change your mind, your mind

Believe me, you're acting like the sound of a gun
Anyway, you're shooting and you're getting it wrong
Blowing the lights out alone in my room
'Cause I'm waiting for you

I'm not the route you prefer
And actions speak louder than words
If you fight with yourself, it's still a fight
You can't win all the time

But you're killing me, you're not feeling me
It's unfamiliar inside, inside
On repeat, you see, she is incomplete
You're never going to change your mind, your mind

Believe me, you're acting like the sound of a gun
Anyway, you're shooting and you're getting it wrong
Blowing the lights out alone in my room
'Cause I'm waiting for you
Believe me, I'm nothing like the person I was
Couldn't blame the reasoning for all of your flaws
It's out of proportion, how everything goes
But she wouldn't know

And it's no wonder that everyone falls
Clinging on to my telephone calls
Waiting for nine, it's your platform sign
Which way is taking me home
Always late, I leave when it's dark
No waiting in empty bars
And you're somone's absolute excuse
And she doesn't know

Believe me
Anyway, you're shooting and you're getting it wrong
Blowing the lights out alone in my room
'Cause I'm waiting for you
Believe me, I'm nothing like the person I was
Couldn't blame the reasoning for all of your flaws
It's out of proportion, how everything goes
But she wouldn't know

You're someone's absolute excuse
And she doesn't know
