Pretty when the wind blows
I'll love my tree in autumn
Like I love my tree in summer
Like I love my tree in winter

They put me in a room
And I thought of you in autumn
And I'm sad I wont
See you again

Pretty when you sing me
A new song in autumn
Or a new song in winter
Or a new song in summer

Pretty when you put down
Your bow? and come over
With the smell of your breath
That I love

With the look in your eye that I love.
