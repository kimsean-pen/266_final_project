Now where do you go after midnight
When all the doors should be closed
Your alibis just don't sound right
And I asked but nobody knows
Then you look in me the eye
And then you sound so very nice
With your true lies
Hey, someone's been sleepin' in my bed
'Cause this room don't smell like you and me
Someone's been sneakin' out the window
Do you think I'm too blind to see
When you look me in the eye
And make it sound so very nice
With your true lies
It was a clever disguise
But girl, I'm gettin' wise
To your true lies
Well, you been doin' this so long now
Thinkin' it's the truth
I guess it don't seem wrong
If it ain't bein' done to you
Ya gotta lot to learn, baby
You can't keep it down
When the word gets in the wind
Then it's bound to blow back around

Girl, can you give me a reason
I bet you don't even know why
I can't figure out what you're thinkin'
Or what it is you're tryin' to justify
Hey, when you look me in the eye
And make it sound so very nice
With your true lies
It was a clever disguise
But girl, I'm getting wise
To your true lies
Yeah, you can laugh, you can cry
But girl, I just can't buy
Your true... true lies
