I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love

You give me light
So tonight take me there
I feel your sun start to glow
And I know it, let me show you

That I want your love,
I need your touch
For the rest of our time together, baby
Come fly with me eternally
You and me, we were meant to be

Yeah, hey, alright
(Right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah, hey, alright
(Right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah, hey
We got to come together, baby
It's alright now

I see your eyes
Hold the key to my paradise
Summer in your smile
Well, it makes me feel so real
(So real)

You tell me things
And my heart sings to the world
From islands in the sky
Take my hand, as one we will stand
You know it's never never
To say hello to forever

Yeah, hey, alright
(Right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah, hey, alright
(Right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever

Yeah, hey, alright
(Right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah, hey, alright
(Right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah, hey

I need your love
I need your love
I need your love

I need your touch
I want your love so much
I need your touch
(Need your love, need your love)
And I want your love so much
(Need your love, need your love)

Do it to me now, now tonight
(Need your love, need your love)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever

Yeah, hey, alright
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah, hey, alright
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
