Now and then you get what you want
Now and then you get what you want
I don't want to talk
I wish I was dead

The reservoir is filling with mold
The reservoir is filling with mold
I don't want to talk
I wish I was dead

Oh bunny rabbit
Jaundiced by the bummer of habit
Is there a plantain big enough
To cave your head in?

Sweet clot you are what you are
Sweet clot you is what you is
You feel it now
Misplaced by the world

I don't want to talk
I wish I were dead

Born to suffer
You are embarrassed by this thought
And with that all your dreams are gone

Fall apart
Try not to cry in public
Try not to cry in public
Try not to cry in the shower
And try not cry at the clinic

Port au prince
If God won't come I'll go to him

Born to suffer,
Born to suffer,
Born to suffer
