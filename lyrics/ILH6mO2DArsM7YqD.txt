I, I only want to follow
Safe and miss the hollow
When I find the scene you're on

I defined a kiss my darling
When we get these dreams on
Making like we feel it

And now I find my days
Just like a dream
I left alive

And it's like a force on a winged horse
A terrible beauty

And it's over, over, over, over, over, over, oh
