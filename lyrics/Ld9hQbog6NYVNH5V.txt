Curtains down, I'm laughing at the trial
Help me to unravel
Tangle of my innocence inside
Faith's 'bout to be severed
Oh oh oh oh
Won't get any better
Oh oh oh oh
Walk under the ladder
Shout out just one reason what's this for

You can see that whatever the weather
That the wind's always there, always fair
Oh oh oh oh
And it always has been now or never
The decision has got to be made

Oh oh oh

Desparate thoughts, your hope calls you a liar
Fear begins to revel
Nothing but your will sets you on fire
Fire lasts forever
Oh oh oh oh
Can't get any better
Oh oh oh oh

Dance under the ladder
If you dare, so what you're waiting for

You can see that whatever the weather
That the wind's always there, always fair
Oh oh oh oh

And it always has been now or never
The decision has got to be made
Oh oh oh

You can see that whatever the weather
That the wind's always there, always fair
Oh oh oh
And it always has been now or never
The decision has got to be made
You can see that whatever the weather
That the wind's always there, always fair
Oh oh oh oh
And it always has been now or never
The decision has got to be made
Oh oh oh
