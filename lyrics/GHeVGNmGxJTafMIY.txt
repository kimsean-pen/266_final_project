I wonder if I even look like you
My horoscope told me not to feel blue
What's the point of all of these love songs?
You've replaced me now, let me you too

I was in 5th grade, where is your shame?
The Beastie Boys didn't own their own airplane
Do you recognize your own daughter?
Is your life much better without her?

I keep wishing you away
Wishing you away, wishing you away
Wishing you away, wishing you away
Still I'm wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay, wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay, wishing you would stay

I had a dream that you were dead
And I woke up crying in my head
It made no sense 'cause I don't know you
But it felt like everything was true

I keep wishing you away
Wishing you away, wishing you away
Wishing you away, wishing you away
Still I'm wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay, wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay, wishing you would stay

I keep wishing you away
Wishing you away, wishing you away
Wishing you away, wishing you away
Still I'm wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay, wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay, wishing you would stay

Oh, I'm still scared of all of you
And I don't know what you might do
Won't you let me meet my brother?
And do you like to hit my mother?
Toby said you denied me
Is your life just like a movie?
Won't you let me meet my brother?
And we can hide it from my mother

I keep wishing you away
Wishing you away, wishing you away
Wishing you away, wishing you away
Still I'm wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay, wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay, wishing you would stay

I keep wishing you away
Wishing you away, wishing you away
Wishing you away, wishing you away
Still I'm wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay, wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay, wishing you would stay

I wish that you would stay
I wish that you would stay
I wish that you would stay
I wish, I wish, I wish
