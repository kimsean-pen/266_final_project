Thomas County Law has got a crooked tooth
Every traffic light is red when it tells the truth
The church bell isn't kiddin' when it cries for you
Nobody looks away when the sun goes down

Thomas County road takes you where it will
Someone singin' on the far side of the hill
There's nowhere safe to bury all the time I've killed
Nobody looks away when the sun goes down

There's a couple of ways to cross on this county line
You can't see beyond the trees they're too tall and wide
And I never seem to see around my brother's wife

Nobody looks away when the sun goes down
There are castles for king
There are birds without wings
I can whine about it all
But I won't

Thomas County Law has got a crooked tooth
There ain't a mother with a heart less than black and blue
When they hold him to the light you can see right through

Every dreamer falls asleep with their dancin' shoes
I may say I don't belong here but I know I do
Nobody looks away when the sun goes down
Nobody looks away when the sun goes down
