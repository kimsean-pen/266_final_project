I tried hard to be good to you
I felt peace inside my head
Its impossible to just be cool
Please please please
Don't don't don't
Walk like my single hope
We closed our lips and we called it our love
We swallowed a clover made of lead
Its unmanageable to just keep on living
Please please please
Don't don't don't
Walk like my single hope
I can only say it
So many times
