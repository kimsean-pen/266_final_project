I was scatterbrained
When I found the time to find
That times are evil
Sick and disjointed
My skin is thick
Thick and calloused
I'm ready to shed the shell
Ready to shed the shell

So you think you have figured me out
A young man lost in his problems
Some problems aren't that easy to solve
You can't break our code of energy

I'm bent out of shape
There is no happy ending
I've come to a point
Where I just don't give a fuck
My skin is thick
Thick and calloused
I'm ready to shed the shell
Ready to shed the shell

The code of energy
Ready to shed the shell
The code of energy
Ready to shed the shell
The code of energy
Ready to shed the shell
The code of energy

So you think you have figured me out
A young man lost in his problems
Some problems aren't that easy to solve
You can't break our code of energy

Code
Code of energy
Code of energy
Damn!
Code of energy
Damn!

Hi
I'm paranoid
Goodbye
I'm in the void
Haunted by insecurity
Bipolar asymmetry

Our new vision of passion and obsession
Is planetary ingestion
And there is no time for question...

We don't need any special equipment
No descrambler, no black box
Our antennas are up, aligned, and ready to recieve
We are all just searching, searching for satellite signal

Waiting for the channel to come in loud and clear
So you think you have figured me out
A young man lost in his problems
Some problems aren't that easy to solve
You can't break our code of energy
So you think you have figured me out
A young man lost in his problems
