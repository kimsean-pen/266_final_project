We've had enough time to find what we are
The reason we should be walking in the dark
But now we should know how cruel love can be

You take so long to say, it only makes it harder
You're pushing me away farther and farther
You pretend as if you don't know how it's bringing me down

Why don't you believe in me?
Oh, what did I do?
Ooh, and now that you're leaving
Because you need something new
Yeah, wish I was with you

Tried to remain constant like a flowing stream
And I tried my best to be all that you need
Please don't close the door, take a step back

I wake up all alone, the nights keep getting harder
I wanna call you but I don't, I want to be smarter
I'm afraid to make my next move and it's bringing me down
Why don't you believe in me?
Oh, what did I do?
Ooh, and now that you're leaving
Because you need something new
Oh, you wish I was with you
