We kiss too much
We kiss too much
You want my touch
I get my touch
It's double dutch
It's double dutch
Don't stay in touch
Don't stay in touch

We are in the black black water
In the black black water
We're deep black water
In the black black water
We're deep black water
In the black black water
In deep black water
In the black black water

Don't stay in touch
It's double dutch
Just stay in touch
I'm on the trouble
We drink too much
I'm on the trouble
We drink too much
It's double dutch

I've got a hunch
I've got a hunch
You're gonna crunch
You're gonna crunch
Don't buy me lunch
Don't buy me lunch
I've got a hunch
I've got a hunch

We are in the black black water
In the black black water
We're deep black water
In the black black water
We're deep black water
In the black black water
In deep black water
In the black black water

It's double dutch
Just stay in touch
I'm on the trouble
We drink too much
I'm on the trouble
We drink too much
It's double dutch

We are in the black black water
In the black black water
We're deep black water
In the black black water
We're deep black water
In the black black water
In deep black water
In the black black water

Don't stay in touch
It's double dutch
Just stay in touch
I'm on the trouble
We drink too much
I'm on the trouble
We drink too much
It's double dutch
