Reading law at your desk
Praying for your parents
They are so proud of this

You are working so hard
All alone at your desk
Obligated to free them

Labor concern as a good girl
You curse the night that is calling
Labor at doubt like a good girl

Seo, seo, seo, seo
Seo, seo, seo, seo, seo

Love to Diaspora
De life en le valley
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You are working so hard
Sitting still at your desk
Pusan weighing upon you

Fending off all distress
Glitter for your parents
Hoping in discount clothing

Seo, seo, seo
Seo, seo, seo
Seo, seo, seo
Seo, seo, seo

Finding the slacks
You will fit in
Wearing the shoes
That you'll look good in

Overwhelmed at your desk
Weeping for your parents
They are so proud of this

Shining in ambition
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
