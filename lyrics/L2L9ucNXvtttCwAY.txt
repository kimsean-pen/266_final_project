Time, pulling like a feather
From your eyes
Try, try to live it better
Bide your time
Desire, I am barely thinking
In the dark
And life, life is what you wanted
It's what you are
Shy, is anybody thinking
From outside
Close, watching people watching
You go down

Devour, melting every building
You have been in
So talk, talk about the lonely
In each journey
