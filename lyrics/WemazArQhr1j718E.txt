Low grade buzz)
I got that low grade buzz
I got that low grade buzz, I'm hangin'
I got that low grade buzz, keeping me out of it
I got that low grade buzz, I'm hangin'
Circling around an airfield again, I'm older now again
Got loved ones spilling out of me
The dead ones are at peace now
I still think of them for some release how
I'll never hear a real life sound come out their mouths
I'm hangin'
Low grade buzz, keeping me out of it
I got that low grade buzz, I'm hangin'
I got that low grade buzz, it's keeping me out of it
I got that low grade buzz
I'm not crashing down and out, at least not yet anyway
I'm not satisfied either, still tryna think of ways to please ya
Escaped into a room I booked
Feel my body decomposing
Make sure that I'm not imposing
Have my oldest friends come up and crawl into my bed
And try to settle this frequency down
I got that low grade buzz, it's keeping me out of it
I got that low grade buzz, I'm hangin'
I got that low grade buzz, it's keeping me hangin'
I got that low grade buzz, I'm hangin'
Closed my eyes, found someone beautiful's hand in the dark
The sun came up, we sat in silence
And just like always I felt like her friends just wanted me gone
But we admired each other, and I felt like
The lucky one
Low grade buzz, keeping me out of it
I got that low grade buzz, I'm hangin'
I got that low grade buzz, it's keeping me out of it
I got that low grade buzz, hangin' around
(Keeping me out of it, I got that low grade buzz)
(Low grade buzz, I'm hangin')
