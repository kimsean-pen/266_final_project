Slow down, breath, ya going too fast
Take a deep breath if you wanna make it last
It pulls me down, the feeling drowns
Holding on to what dream too far
And a room's get lost in the dark of it all
I'm lost here in the night, been to sleep for all this time
Only when my eyes can see no more (under slowdown)
Things will never be what they were before (under slowdown, boy)

Drowning a little bit everyday
Hard to make the feeling last, so sad
The sun comes up and there's been no sleep
I fall so deep
And I can see your hands as they reach down the well

I am moon-white (brother, brother)
Sweep the floors when they fire up
Faster, sleep, dreaming, I never weak up
I can see my reflection
My feet on the ground make the only sound

Drowning a little bit everyday
Hard to make the feeling last, so sad
The sun comes up and there's been no sleep
I fall so deep
And I can see your hands as they reach down the well

This fight, only to fuck with myself
Only to cry blood tears
Only to cover the wounds
To heal in the darkness (to heal in the darkness)
Heal in the darkness

Drowning a little bit everyday
Hard to make the feeling last, so sad
The sun comes up and there's been no sleep
I fall so deep

Drowning a little bit everyday
Hard to make the feeling last, so sad
The sun comes up and there's been no sleep
I fall so deep
And I can see your hands as they reach down the well
