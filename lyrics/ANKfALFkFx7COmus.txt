There's a place I can go
Where the rides never close
Come on down
(Down, down)
It's a barrel of fun
Spinning round 'til I'm numb
On this merry-go-round
(On this merry-go-round)

Going riding, riding, riding from me

Anyone can see
That I've had too much to dream
I'm singing 'til I'm screaming
Dancing 'til I'm bleeding
A cruel reality
When you've had too much to dream
Better keep your eyes shut
Cause you don't wanna wake up

Through the mouth of a clown
Take the zipper, go down
What a thrill
(Thrill, thrill)
All the cocktails are pink
Wet your lips, you can drink
'Til you get your fill
('Til you get your fill)

Going riding, riding, riding from me

Anyone can see
That i've had too much to dream
I'm singing 'til i'm screaming
Dancing 'til i'm bleeding
A cruel reality
When you've had too much to dream
Better keep your eyes shut
Cause you don't wanna wake up

(Ooh)
Everybody's waiting
For the curtain call
(Ooh)
I'm the fool who's busy
Singing to the wall

Anyone can see
That i've had too much to dream
I'm singing 'til I'm screaming
Dancing 'til I'm bleeding
A cruel reality
When you've had too much to dream
Better keep your eyes shut
Cause you don't wanna wake up

Anyone can see
That I've had too much to dream
Im singing 'til I'm screaming
Dancing 'til I'm bleeding
A cruel reality
When you've had too much to dream
Better keep your eyes shut
Cause you don't wanna wake up

Anyone can see
That I've had too much to dream
Im singing 'til I'm screaming
Dancing 'til I'm bleeding
A cruel reality
When you've had too much to dream
Better keep your eyes shut
Cause you don't wanna wake up
