We wake up lonely
And feeling small
We're not the only
To see the writing
On the wall
We have our coffees
And dump our trash
Like kamikazes
We're heading for a crash

There's no going back
We're on a one way track
Don't you know that
Sour days are here to stay?

Some like it salty
Some like it sweeter
Some like it malty
With some oats and
A twist of wheat
Some say go plenty
Some want it dry
We sure feel empty
When we fail after every try

There's no going back
We're on a one way track
Don't you know that sour days
Are here to stay?
So just give in
If your patience's wearing thin
And just accept that sour days
Are here to stay

First time will almost
Taste like shampoo
Second time will still
Be a bit weird
Third time it starting
To grow on you
Soon you'll check
In as a volunteer
To rep the sour days, yeah!

No going back
We're on a one way track
Don't you know that sour days
Are here to stay?
So just give in
For this is not the end
And just accept that sour days
Are here to stay

There is no going back
Don't you know that sour days
Are here to stay?
Yeah
