Can't deal with it
Hold it!
I'm playing for all the sick in my heart
It's rectified, lazy I tears us apart
Can't deal with it
Tears us apart
Can't deal with it
So I float all night to the slack of the moon
I'm glowing real bright while I stare at the mirror
Sending bullets after me
Cool it, cool it, cool it down
Can't deal with it

I'm running out
Hounds are barking at the back door
Every now, now and then I look around
And I hunker down on my floor
Can't deal with it, can't deal with it
Can't deal with it, can't deal with it
Down on my floor
Can't deal with it, can't deal with it
Can't deal with it, can't deal with it
So I float all night
In the slack of the moon
I'm glowing real bright while I stare at the mirror
Sending bullets after me
Cool it, cool it, cool it down
Can't deal with it
