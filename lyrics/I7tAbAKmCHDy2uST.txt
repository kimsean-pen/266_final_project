Lying on the ground
As battle rages on
Warm blood covers
The cold land of our fathers

Don't cry for me my son
Because I'm not the only one
Where I go you can't follow
This journey I will make all alone

I've bled so many times for this land
But this wound will claim my life
Death commands

Let not my people
Live under oppression
And remember the darker the night
The more beautiful is morning's light

I've bled so many times for this land
But this wound will claim my life
Death commands me to give my hand

Fear no more
Just let go
Adore this world
Once more
The truth unfolds
In the Ancient Halls
Fear no more
Just let go

There is no shimmer of the light
In this pouring rain
I close my eyes
Has it all been in vain?
