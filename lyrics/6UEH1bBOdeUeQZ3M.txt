Hey there now
Where'd you go
You left me here so unexpected
You changed my life
I hope you know
Cause now I'm lost
So unprotected
In a blink of an eye
I never got to say goodbye

Like a shooting star
Flyin' across the room
So fast so far
You were gone too soon
You're part of me
And I'll never be
The same here without you
You were gone too soon

You were always there
And like shining light
On my darkest days
You were there to guide me
Oh I miss you now
I wish you could see
Just how much your memory
Will always mean to me
In a blink of an eye
I never got to say goodbye

Like a shooting star
Flyin' across the room
So fast so far
You were gone too soon
You're part of me
And I'll never be
The same here without you
You were gone too soon

Shine on! shine on!
To a better place
Shine on! shine on!
Will never be the same

Like a shooting star
Flyin' across the room
So fast so far
You were gone too soon
You're part of me
And I'll never be
The same here without you
You were gone too soon

Shine on! shine on!
You were gone too soon
Shine on! shine on!
You were gone too soon
Shine on! shine on!
You were gone too soon
