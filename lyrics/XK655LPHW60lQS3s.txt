Gonna lose it in the music
Gonna lose it in the music
Gonna lose it in the music
Gonna lose it in the music

On the dancefloor
Gonna lose it in the music
On the dancefloor
Got my body gonna use it
On the dancefloor
Must be, must be

Good times, bad times, baby you're in trouble
You stole my heart and you're given me up
And we're not even friends so how can we be lovers
I want to know the truth

'Cause I've had enough, I'm sick and tired of pleasing you
Have I had your love, is that the best that you can do?
You can dream of changing my mind but your wasting your time
'Cause if you think you've got me, right, just watch me

On the dancefloor
Gonna lose it in the music
On the dancefloor
Got my body gonna use it
On the dancefloor
The best that you never had but now you've lost me
So come on watch me getting over you

Had your chance but baby you blew it
You never loved me and baby you knew it
And every time that you messed with my mind
I still believed in you

'Cause I've had enough, I'm sick and tired of pleasing you
Have I had your love, is that the best you can do?
You can dream of changing my mind but you're way out of line
'Cause if you think you've got me, if you think you've got me
Boy, just watch me

On the dancefloor
Gonna lose it in the music
On the dancefloor
Got my body gonna use it
On the dancefloor
The best that you never had but now you've lost me
So come on watch me getting over you

On the dancefloor
Gonna lose it in the music
On the dancefloor
Got my body gonna use it
On the dancefloor
The best that you never had but now you've lost me
So come on watch me getting over you

You can dream of changing my mind but your wasting your time
'Cause if you think you've got me, if you think you've got me
Boy, just watch me

On the dancefloor
Gonna lose it in the music
On the dancefloor
Got my body gonna use it
On the dancefloor
The best that you never had but now you've lost me
So come on watch me getting over you

On the dancefloor
Gonna lose it in the music
On the dancefloor
Got my body gonna use it
On the dancefloor
The best that you never had but now you've lost me
So come on watch me getting over you
