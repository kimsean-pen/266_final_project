The kids need education
And the streets are never clean
I've seen a certain disposition
Prevailing in the wind

Sweet change, if anybody's listening?
Emergency on planet earth
Is that life that I am witnessing
Or just another wasted birth?

Now we got emergency
Emergency on planet earth
Now we got emergency
We got emergency on planet earth, just a head up

Think we're standing for injustice
White gets two and black gets five years
Well it took me quite a while to suss this
Now I know my head is cleared

And a little boy in hungry land
Is just a picture in the news
I won't see him in the TV advertising
'Cause it might put you off your food

Now we got emergency
We got emergency on planet earth
Now we got emergency
We got emergency on planet earth, come on

Is anybody out there?
Is anybody out there?
Is anybody out there?
We got emergency on planet earth, just a head up

See what we got
Emergency on planet earth is what we got
I tell 'em what we got now
Emergency on planet earth is what we got

Is someone out there?
Emergency on planet earth is what we got
Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
'Cause we got an emergency

Come on somebody help us now
I will need you
Somebody help us now
