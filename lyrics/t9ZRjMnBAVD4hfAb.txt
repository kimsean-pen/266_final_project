and givin' all i have to give

So here i stand in front of you to say
Yeah, you're the only one i want
but love is all i have to giveBut if I could give you everything i would
All the mountains and the oceans and the seas
but all i have is love to give
won't you tell me you're the one for me

So im starin at the gates of all my dreams
and i can see you far inside
cuz you're walking down the road with me

Down the mountains and the valleys like a breeze
Yeah we going where we want to go
Yeah we doing anything we pleaseInstrumental Solo

All the mountains and the oceans and the seas

But if love is all you need than we are good
