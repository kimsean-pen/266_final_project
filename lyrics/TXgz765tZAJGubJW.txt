Don't you know about this road of rust?
People always want to say "You'll be fine"
But they don't know the pain I'm driving through
They don't know about the traffic in my life
I'm driving down 101
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
That all my friends are waiting down with me
And normally, normally, normally
I'll see they are right
My brothers give me strength when I am alone
They help me push on through the dark
To the other side
My sisters give me love when I am down
Their words are honey to my ears
Every time
I'm driving down 101
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
All my friends are waiting down with me
And normally, normally, normally
I'll see they are right
I'm driving down 101
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
All my friends are waiting down with me
And normally, normally, normally
I'll see they are right
Always alright, always on
Always alright, always on
Always alright, always on
Always alright, always on

I'm driving down 101
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
All my friends are waiting down with me
And normally, normally, normally
I'll see they are right
