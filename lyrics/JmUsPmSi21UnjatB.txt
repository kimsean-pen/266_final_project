I've gotta get over
I've gotta get over
I've got to get better
Will love you forever

I've gotta find genius
(Caramel)
I've gotta get better
(Caramel)
I've gotta stop smoking
(Caramel)
I've gotta get better
(Caramel, caramel)

Where is the magic?
I've gotta get better
Oh, Lord, give me magic
I'll love you forever

I've gotta find Mounts Hill
(Caramel)
And live by the mountains
(Caramel)
I'll love you forever
(Caramel)
You are
(Caramel) You are

(Caramel)
(Caramel)
(Caramel)
(Caramel)
(Caramel)
