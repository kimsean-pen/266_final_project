Between You And Me
Verse 1:
Why can't you tell the truth
Why is it hard to choose
Why I am loving you
When you don't know if you're true
Why did I give my trust
Why did you promise so much
Why did I hastitate to leave
When you ain't no gook for me

B - section:
I can't - go on this way
With hoped you - would feel the same
Cause I can't do - what I really want to
That's why I'm leaving you know baby

Hook:
How could you really think - that I would sit and wait
For you ro rry to make - a decision about us

If it was up to me - we'd both live faithfully
But there's no security beetween you and me

Verse 2:
Don't know if you love me
Don't know if I should be
Don't know what is to be
But I gotta know or let go
Don't know what's in your pain
I don't know just where we stand
I just don't know if I can
Be a part of questioned plans

Repeat B -section

Bridge:
what makes you think
I'll sit and wait
While you go and play your games
I won't be this way
