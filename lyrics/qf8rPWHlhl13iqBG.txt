Well I'm back, back to the house again
You used to stand in the window
Now it's just staring back at me
Oh the love you gave me, was of a kind you get once
The sorrow grown deeper, it's dug a hole in me

Now it's grown a part of me
It's not the same, I'm not the same
Can I change it back again?

I'm so lost now, B
Won't you come back home again?
You taught me I could do anything
Now I'm not so sure of it
I'm so lost without u B
Won't you come on home again?
Well, they say this is for life
And they say love never dies

Well I'm back, back to the house again
I never felt this empty, they say it will pass
Oh, but it will never pass
I will forever more carry this stone
Come back to see me, show yourself
I'm Orpheo
Lord, is that too much to ask for?

This is how it has to be
You're not the same, I'm not the same
Can I change it back again?

I'm not a child anymore and things come to an end
But I've never understood the end
I've never understood the end

Come on, show yourself
In a crowd somewhere
Let me know your alright
Where you are right now
Let me close my eyes
When I look again
Let me see your face
Let me hear you say
That it's alright
