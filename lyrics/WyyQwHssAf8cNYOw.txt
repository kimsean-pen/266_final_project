A dream of togetherness
Turned into a brighter mess
A faint sigh my spoken best
Now, now

Make way for the simple hours
No finding the time it's ours
A fate or it's a desire
I know

So I was the lucky one
Reading letters, not writing them
Taking pictures of anyone
I know

So let the sun shine
So let the sun shine
So let the sun shine
Let it come
To show us that tomorrow is eventual
We know it when the day is done

So let the sun shine
So let the sun shine
So let the sun shine
Let it come
To show us that tomorrow is eventual
We know it when the day is done

So let the sun shine
So let the sun shine
So let the sun shine
Let it come
To show us that tomorrow is eventual
We know it when the day is done
