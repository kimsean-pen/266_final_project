The rain is comin' down tonight
I'm smilin' lookin' at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flyin' right back
To when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be runnin' them streets like we owned the town

And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do oou
Seven kids on a two lane road
Had the guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads,

Sweet child of mine
Sippin' on the local's spark of light
Uh ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted tiiiime, all that wasted tiiiime

Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothin' like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the bird in the game

But I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do oou
Seven kids on a two lane road
We had the guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads,

Sweet child of mine
Sippin' on the local's spark of light
Eh ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted tiiiime, all that wasted tiiiime
Swingin' out on the liiiine
Livin' all that wasted time

Hey, hey, now, woou
Summer dresses layin' out on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were livin' every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothin' but we had it all

When I think about those summer nights
Sneakin' out the window, runnin' back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted tiiiime, all that wasted tiiiime
We were swingin' out on the liiiine
Livin' all that wasted tiiiime
Hey, you know oooh ooh
Don't you feel it comin' on back now
(tiiiime, tiiiime, tiiiime)
