piece of cake!

uh -
uh -
too many people going underground
too many reaching for a piece of cake.

too many people pulled and pushed around
too many waiting for that lucky break.
that was your first mistake
you took your lucky break and broke it in two.

now what can be done for you?
you broke it in two.
too many people sharing party lines
too many people ever sleeping late.

too many people paying parking fines
too many hungry people losing weight.
that was your first mistake
you took your lucky break and broke it in two.

now what can be done for you?
you broke it in two.
mm-mm-uh-uh.
uh!

too many people preaching practices
don't let 'em tell you what you wanna be.
too many people holding back
this is crazy, and baby, it's not like me.
that was your last mistake
i find my love awake and waiting to be.
now what can be done for you?
she's waiting for me - yeah
