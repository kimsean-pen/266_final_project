Took my time
But it's oh so deep
Won't sleep forever
I survived
You should know
You don't get no surrender

Hey
No I'm never gonna fade away
You ain't never gonna see the day
Oh I won't say bye

No doubt you wrote me off long ago
But now I won't give up
This ain't over, over, over
This ain't over, over, over
And each time you let me off, cut the rope
I just come back harder
This ain't over, over, over
This ain't over, over, over

This ain't over, over
This ain't over, over, over

I'm alive
Til my last breaths done
I'll run, I'm ready
Visualize
Til my kingdom comes
My heart won't stay

Hey
No I'm never gonna fade away
You ain't never gonna see the day
Oh I won't say bye

No doubt you wrote me off long ago
But now I won't give up
This ain't over, over, over
This ain't over, over, over
And each time you let me off, cut the rope
I just come back harder
This ain't over, over, over
This ain't over, over, over

Hey
No I'm never gonna fade away
You ain't never gonna see the day
Oh I won't say bye
This ain't over, over, over
No
This ain't over, over, over
No

No doubt you wrote me off long ago
But now I won't give up
This ain't over, over, over
This ain't over, over, over
And each time you let me off, cut the rope
I just come back harder
This ain't over, over, over
This ain't over, over, over
No it ain't over
