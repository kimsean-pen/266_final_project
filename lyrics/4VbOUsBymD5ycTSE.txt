The time we used to be in love
And I have no doubt
I was fooling you
잘 봐 난 늘 익숙한 듯
내 맘을 속이고 눈을 감을꺼야
Cause you have magic in your eyes
I can't help falling for you right now
Is it guilty you?
Or Is it guilty me?
Baby, you're gone away from my life
I can't resist
Honestly I want
Is it guilty you?
Or is it guilty me?
Baby, I don't want to love
Love
Love
Baby, I don't want to love
Love
Love
Baby, I don't want to
And now
See what happens
Why am I getting hurt?
I never wanted it, but
내가 더 지쳐 쓰러지면
이 모든 아픔도 익숙할테니까
Cause you have magic in your eyes
I can't help falling for you right now
Is it guilty you?
Or is it guilty me?
Baby, you're gone away from my life
I can't resist
Honestly, I want
Is it guilty you?
Or is it guilty me?
Baby, I don't want to love
Love
Love
Baby, I don't want to love
Love
Love
Baby, I don't want to
Is it guilty you?
Or is it guilty me?
Is it guilty you?
Or is it guilty me?
Baby, I don't want to love
Love
Love
Baby, I don't want to love
Love
Love
Baby, I don't want to
