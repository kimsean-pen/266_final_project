Froze asleep
Coma deep
I dream I'm not out with you
Alone at sea

And you watched the waves
And you sang to me
As we sink
I dream I'm not out with you

Dropping deep
Below the sea
This dream I had with you
Alone at sea

And we watch the waves
You sing to me
As we sink
This dream I had with you
Alone at sea...
