Going blind from the heat
In the middle of a sunlit street
Seeing thoughts on repeat
But I'd rather get something to eat

Feeling sensless and beat
and I wonder at the chance that we'll meet.

Deadbeat Summer.
It's just a Deadbeat Summer.

Deadbeat Summer.
It's just a Deadbeat Summer.

Deadbeat Summer.
It's just a Deadbeat Summer.

Deadbeat Summer.
It's just a Deadbeat Summer.

You're the one that I miss
From the summer when I'd stolen a kiss
Hear the endless hiss
As it rolls into the starlight abyss

All my dreams reminisce
Never thought this time would be like this

Deadbeat Summer.
It's just a Deadbeat Summer.
Deadbeat Summer.
It's just a Deadbeat Summer.
Deadbeat Summer.
It's just a Deadbeat Summer.
Deadbeat Summer.
It's just a Deadbeat Summer.
