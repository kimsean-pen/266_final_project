I swapped my innocence for pride, crushed the end within my stride
Said I'm strong now I know that I'm a leaver
I love the sound of you walking away, you walking away
Mascara bleeds a blackened tear, oh
And I am cold, yes, I'm cold but not as cold as you are
I love the sound of you walking away, you walking away
I love the sound of you walking away, walking away, hey, hey
Why don't you walk away?
Why don't you walk away?

Why don't you walk away? No buildings will fall down

Don't you walk away, no quake will split the ground
Won't you walk away, the sun won't swallow the sky
Won't you walk away? Statues will not cry, don't you walk away
Why don't you walk away?
Why don't you walk away?
Why don't you walk away? Hey
I cannot turn to see those eyes as apologies may rise
I must be strong, stay an unbeliever

And love the sound of you walking away, you walking away

Mascara bleeds into my eye, oh and I'm not cold
I am old at least as old as you are
And as you walk away
Oh as you walk away
Oh as you walk away, my headstone crumbles down
As you walk away, the Hollywood winds will howl
As you walk away, the Kremlin's falling
As you walk away, radio four is static
As you walk away

Oh as you walk away
Oh as you walk away
Oh as you walk away hey
The stab of stiletto on a silent night
Stalin smiles and Hitler laughs
Churchill claps Mao Tse Tung on the back
