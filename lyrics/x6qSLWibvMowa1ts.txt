Just imagine a trip to a wonderful land
Of candy, and jam, and ice cream

I gotta hit that street you better watch it
With a gat that I cock with a full clip
I got the whip, got the pitch thought I'd keep it undercover
All up in the club just to live it up
See the stone cold face, try to knock it
I can't be trapped, never walk, I'm a rocket
I gotta be in it, I gotta grip in it
I gotta be-ba-da-be-ba-da-be-da-be-it

See the big gold chain that I'm rockin'
I got the ring for the bling, not a problem
I got a stash full of cash that I owe to my brother
All up in the club, just to live it up
Look how the streets turn cold when I walk it
It's my rules no man can stop it
I throw a kick so quick that'll leave you in the gutter
Leave you in the gutter, gutter, gutter...

All up in the gut, all up in the gutter...

Just imagine, wonderful land

I know all these things never happen
I'm just a random girl with gentle manners
In my dreams I rock and I rule the wonderland, rule the wonderland...

All up in the gut, all up in the gutter.
