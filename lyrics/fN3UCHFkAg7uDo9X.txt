Lay down low
You give it all
Fresh trace on my back
Hands on my face
You want it all
Lay down low
Lay down low
Eyes wide
Which soon disappear

Take this back
'Cause I know you
Won't limit that
All this time
Just a zombie
Blackened moon
Sure it has helped

Lights stream past
Like a fountain
Just running back

So leave it one step further back
Just leave it one step further back
Leave it one step further back

One step, one step, one step, one step
One step, one step, one step, one step
One step, one step, one step, one step
One step, one step, one step, one step
One step, one step, one step

You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go
