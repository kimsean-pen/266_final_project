Past the road to your house
That you never call home
Where they turned out your lights
Though they say you'll never know

I remember running through the wet grass
And falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately Wanting

When they pumped out your guts
Filled you full of those pills
You were never quite right
Deserving all the chills
They say the worst is over
Kicked it over again
Then they ask what went wrong
When they turn you on again
When they turn you on again

I remember running through the wet grass
And falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately Wanting

Kick them right in the face
Make them wish they weren't born
And if they bring up your name
Will they say you won the war
Baby burst in the world
Never given a chance
Then they ask what went wrong
When you never had it right
No you never had it right

I remember running through the wet grass
And falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately Wanting

I remember running through the wet grass
And falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately Wanting

Oh the letters have dropped off
Though they say you got them all
I finally figured out some things you'll never know

Take back your life
And let me inside
We'll find the door if you care to anymore
I remember running through the wet grass
And falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately Wanting
I remember running through the wet grass
And falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately Wanting
