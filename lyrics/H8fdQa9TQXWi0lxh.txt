Miracle

Drink with me
To share the weight
Speak to
Me with an open heart

It's all the same
If we don't try
Forget the dream
I'm lost inside

In solitude
I hit the ground
Peace of mind
Remains unsound

We can let go
With open arms
Don't paint the picture
That you need
Find answers
To what I don't ask
Bring back the kindness
To your mask

You tire my heart
You steal my wings
Anywhere
I lay my head
