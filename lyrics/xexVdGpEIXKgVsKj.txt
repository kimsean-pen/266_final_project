You say horrible things
I laugh because I love you
And when you touch my skin
I think
This isn't boring

I ate a salad today
I ate one yesterday too
You told me I was precious
Now I think
That I am too

We slide into your bed
And then I slide into you
We are two moving skins
I think
This isn't boring

I drive you to the gym
And then I wait there for you
You say to me as we
Get home
There's no one like you

My parents feel that
This is a waste of time
I tell them go away â€˜cause
Everything is just fine
My friends all feel that
I'm different around you
I tell them all that they are wrong
Because I love you

You feel difficult things
It's 12am I hug you
You poured a bit of whisky
Hey
This isn't boring

You know that I don't drink it
It tastes like acetone
Now you don't want to talk
And I
Feel quite alone

I
Have been a snake and
I
Have been a dog
We've
Done this for a while but
Now
It's getting hard

My parents feel that
This is a waste of time
I tell them go away
I won't admit that I am blind
My friends all feel that
I'm carrying us two
I tell them all that they are wrong
Because I love you

Because I love you

My parents feel that
This is a waste of time
I tell them go away
I won't admit that I am blind
My friends all feel that
I'm carrying us two
I tell them all that they are wrong
Because I love you
