Every moment of your life
Is a chance to get it right
Every moment you've been living in
You could turn it all on like a light
And the weight of the years
Has got me burstin' into tears
Standin' here with nothin'
I stand alone inside my fears

And like an actor reveals a deeper state
When I tell you now for me
It's not too late

To tell you baby
It's you and only you and no one else
And I'll mean it
Even when I'm talking to myself
I said maybe, it's you and only you and no one else

And how I miss Moscow
Those people really know
How to have a good time
In a mixed up state of mind
And Monotov's Private Opera's closed
So I guess I'll go home now
Cause there's no where else to go

And tell you baby
It's you and only you and no one else
And I'll mean it
Even when I'm talking to myself
I said baby, it's you and only you and no one else
You and no one else

But I'm lost in a poem
And now I'm walkin' by myself
In the dark, all alone
But these actors and dramatists
Won't send me home

Well, maybe I'm like my father
Strung out on something or another
Held to a standard
We were always sinking under
And maybe I'm like my mother
She shattered cause no one loved her
Maybe I, Maybe I am like no other

And some moments are more real than the books I've read
And the good woman, well maybe she meant what she said
And I'll tell you now some things go straight to my head

And I'll tell you baby
It's you and only you and no one else
And I'll mean it, even when I'm talkin' to myself
I said baby, it's you and only you and no one else
Yes, I mean it, even when I'm talkin' to myself
I'm talkin' to myself
I'm talkin' to myself
I'm talkin' to myself

And baby,
Everything changed in a day
And I know another one on the way
And I'll tell you, baby
Everything changed in a day
And I know (and I know)
Another one (another one)
on the way

And I will tell you
Everything changed in a day
And I know (and I know)
Another one on the way (on the way)
