You don't like rollercoasters, how could you ever love a girl like me?
I took you to the end of my street so you could see my bones
Look up with promises to you, our stars came in a packet of two

She's walking up to you, she's dying to be by your side
She's walking up to you, she's dying to be by your side
Fool's gold, shining in the night, so easy on the eyes
Fool's gold, how many times do I have to realise?
Fool's gold, so bright, fooling everyone in sight
Fool's gold, how many times do I have to realise?

I won't bend to you, no â€“ I don't know how to
Can you handle a girl like her?
She is bolder than you think
And you'd love a girl like me
Well she is running through your dreams
Dragged through the midnight, and it reignites

She's walking up to you, she's dying to be by your side
Fool's gold, shining in the night, so easy on the eyes
Fool's gold, how many times do I have to realise?
Fool's gold, so bright, fooling everyone in sight
Fool's gold, how many times do I have to realise?

She's walking up to you, she's dying to be by your side
Fool's gold, shining in the night, so easy on the eyes
Fool's gold, how many times do I have to realise?
Fool's gold, so bright, fooling everyone in sight
Fool's gold, how many times do I have to realise?

Fool's gold, shining in the night, so easy on the eyes
Fool's gold, how many times do I have to realise?
Fool's gold, so bright, fooling everyone in sight
Fool's gold, how many times do I have to realise?

Fool's gold, shining in the night, so easy on the eyes
Fool's gold, how many times do I have to realise?
