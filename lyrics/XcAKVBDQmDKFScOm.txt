Exuent.
This is three minute axcess,
So pop the question.
Will we leave the last place burning?
Or do we just get leaving?
Red-light, red-light my mind moves to refuse that filter,
Are you still surprised?
Keep my back above the tire tracks.
Sympatric.
I'll meet you,
I will meet you,
I'll meet you at the exit.
