Where have you been, my love?
I've been right here waiting for you to wake up
And how can you sleep knowing
That you'd be much better off there with him
And promising to never let me in
Don't swim
Don't swim
Don't swim

And I was better where
I was miserable, why didn't you leave me there?
And I love you, please don't go
But don't you sit there looking like you know
That I'm the one that kept you from your home
Don't go
Don't go
Don't go

Oh my love,
Tell him that you will meet him at ten
Oh my love,
Just don't let me see him again

I just don't think I can lie
And not tear out both his eyes
Don't lie
Don't lie
Don't lie

Don't
