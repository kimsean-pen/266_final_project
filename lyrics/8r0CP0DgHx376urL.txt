I'm telling you I went dry
I couldn't do it anymore
Told myself that I was fine
It was something that I'd just ignore
That I'd feel a weight lift up
The moment that I followed through
But I guess I fooled myself
Cause I never really wanted to

Oh I knew
That even if I kept you in the dark
It would never do
Because it only takes a spark

I'm standing in the pouring rain
I feel it like a hurricane
A photograph is all it takes
But I know I shouldn't let it
And the memory is rising fast
It's seeping in through every crack
Oh funny how it all comes back
When you're trying to forget it

Here comes the hurricane
Here comes the hurricane

Oh when I cut you off
It was something that I had to do
You can try to push it down
But it's always going to follow you
And yeah if you close your eyes
It doesn't mean you fell asleep
Oh and I could keep you out
But you're never really gonna leave

Oh I knew
Even if I kept you in the dark
It would never do
Because it only takes a spark

I'm standing in the pouring rain
I feel it like a hurricane
A photograph is all it takes
But I know I shouldn't let it
And the memory is rising fast
It's seeping in through every crack
Oh funny how it all comes back
When you're trying to forget it

Here comes the hurricane
Here comes the hurricane

Everybody knows I didn't want it to end
Everybody knows I didn't want it to end

I'm standing in the pouring rain
I feel it like a hurricane
A photograph is all it takes
But I know I shouldn't let it
And the memory is rising fast
It's seeping in through every crack
Oh funny how it all comes back
When you're trying to forget it

Here comes the hurricane
Here comes the hurricane
