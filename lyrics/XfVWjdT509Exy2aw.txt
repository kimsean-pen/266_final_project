man is crippled and dead and
meek and eager in his sin

turn around, say you love the way I
hang around, you miss the spark in my eyes

I was a queen last night
I said take to the water
and let you drink my lies
like "okay, you're right"

you can't spell pain or kiss
or run away or little mistake
without me or A, E, I, O, U

it's not at all unusual
to melt like a ball of wax or
to take what I didn't ask for

it's important being me
it's so important being me
