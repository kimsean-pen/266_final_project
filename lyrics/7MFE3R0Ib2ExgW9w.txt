It's 3 AM, I'm back for more, yeah
Just two of us
Show me what I'm waiting for
One by one, one by one

I saw, I with it
I took time, yeah, I spend it
First time, in a minute
That I worked this hard, that I worked this hard
Thank God, that I did it
One time and I was in it, yeah
But one time ain't enough
I need some more

'Cause there ain't nothing better than you
Got me watching every move
Like you're the only one in the room
Ooh, baby, I can't help myself, girl
And I don't know why but I can't stop thinking
'Bout late last night, when you put it down
Had to turn around and

One by one, one by one

Had to close part two, your floor
One by one, one by one
One by one, we're switching up positions
One by one, girl, show me what I'm missing
