Why would you just stand there
Watch me leave
You always watch me leave
You swore you'd stick around
Have a dance with me
You never danced with me
Won't you please be
My little honey slider
Leave you out to dry
Leave you out on a wire
Why would you get up
And walk out on me
You always walk on me
You swore you'd stick around
And have a drink with me
You never drink on me
Won't you please be
My little honey slider
Leave you out to dry
Leave you out on a wire
'Cause at the very least
I'm gonna find you
My sweet treat
Won't you please be
My little honey slider
Leave you out to dry
Leave you out on a wire
