All you want
All you need
I could be your anything
Tell me girl what you need

Honest eyes, no disguise
You know where I'll be tonight
Tell me girl what you need

'Cause I'll be waiting for you
Trying just to get through
Tell me what to do
Just tell me what to do

And I've been up the whole night
Trying to get my head right
No matter what I do
All I want is you

Oh how I want ya
Oh how I need ya darling
Oh how I want ya
Oh how I need ya darling

Oh how I want ya
Oh how I need ya darling
Oh how I want ya
Oh how I need ya darling

What's the play in this game
Tell me if you feel the same
Do you care either way

You can't fight what feels right
I can see it in your eyes
Say what you want to say

'Cause I'll be waiting for you
Trying just to get through
Tell me what to do
Just tell me what to do

And I've been up the whole night
Trying to get my head right
No matter what I do
All I want is you

Oh how I want ya
Oh how I need ya darling
Oh how I want ya
Oh how I need ya darling

Oh how I want ya
Oh how I need ya darling
Oh how I want ya
Oh how I need ya darling

(Darling, darling, darling, darling)
All I want is you
Oh how I want ya
Oh how I need ya darling
Oh how I want ya
Oh how I need ya darling
Oh how I want ya
Oh how I need ya darling
Oh how I want ya
Oh how I need ya darling
How I, how I want ya
How I, how I need ya
How I, how I want ya
How I, how I need ya
