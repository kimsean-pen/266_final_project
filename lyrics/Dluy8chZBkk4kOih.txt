People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two

Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place

If you look closer it's easy to trace

The tracks of my tears
Oh I need you, need you
Since you left me if you see me with another guy
Looking like I'm having fun

Although he might be cute he's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place

If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading

I'm just a clown since you put me down
My smile is my make-up I wear since my break-up with you
Baby take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place

If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Woah baby take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
