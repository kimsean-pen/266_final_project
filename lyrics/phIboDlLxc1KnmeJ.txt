borders that we say are policing you back to their arms
tension to take pills that'll make you feel higher inside
do you often look back on us feeling confidently
would it make any difference if I wasn't late

or I've been to angry to show
the sovereign statements wrong
it's a bylaw and a value you want to honor hopeful thoughts
it's the talent, not the promotion

Story had shown
you all felt alone
Story had shown
you all felt alone

even if
if the sound it makes when it's tightening
sweet winding of
of a mandolin
hurts your fingers and
and you try to hold on but it's not quite working
this reminds me of the sound you make when we disagree

Story had shown
you all felt alone
Story had shown
you all felt alone

even if you've been so close you're not alone anymore
still we grow
still we grow
it reminds me of the sound you always used to make

Story had shown
you all felt alone
Story had shown
you all felt alone

even if you've been so close you're not alone anymore
still we grow
still we grow
