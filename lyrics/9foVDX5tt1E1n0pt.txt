One, two, three, four

Spiderman, Spiderman
Does whatever a spider can
Spins a web any size
Catches thieves just like flies
Look out, here comes the Spiderman

Is he strong?
Listen Bud
He's got radioactive blood
Can he swing from a thread?
Take a look over head
Hey, there!
There goes the Spiderman
In the chill of the night
At the scene of a crime
Like a streak of light, he arrives just in time

Spiderman, Spiderman
Friendly neighborhood, Spiderman
Wealth and fame, he ignores
Action is his reward
Look out, here comes the Spiderman
Look out

Let's go

In the chill of the night
At the scene of a crime
Like a streak of light, he arrives just in time
Spiderman, Spiderman
Friendly neighborhood, Spiderman
Wealth and fame, he ignores
Action is his reward
To him, life's a great big bang up
Whenever there's a hang up
You'll find the Spiderman
