Trading punches with the heart of darkness
On it goes with your fear and gone it
Never gone until it's stripped away
A part of you has gotta die to change

In the morning you gon' need an answer
Ain't nobody gonna change the standard
It's not enough to just feel the fight
You gotta burn your whole self away

Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up cause it's a hard love
You can't change without a fallout
It's gon' hurt but don't you slow down
Get back up cause it's a hard love
You know the situation can't be right
And all you ever do is fight
But there's a reason that the road is long
It takes some time to make your courage strong
Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up cause it's a hard love
You can't change without a fallout
It's gon' hurt but don't you slow down
Get back up cause it's a hard love
When the wolves come and hunt me down
I will face them off and stand my ground
Cause there's a fire burnin' me
They will see my strength
In this love I've found
Oh

Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up cause it's a hard love
You can't change without a fallout
It's gon' hurt but don't you slow down
Get back up cause it's a hard love

(It's a hard love)
(It's a hard love)
(It's a hard love)
(It's a hard love)

Oh it's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love

Oh it's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love

Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up cause it's a hard love
You can't change without a fallout
It's gon' hurt but don't you slow down
Get back up cause it's a hard love
It's a hard love
