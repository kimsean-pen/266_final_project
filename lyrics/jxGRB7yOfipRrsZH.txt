You've been dazed
and confused for so long (so long)
Singing along, you're singing along
To the same old song
You've been praised
and abused by the amount (the amount)
Of crosses and crowns you lost and found
Echoing through the sound
Their standing ovation drowns you out

You burnout so bright
But you never saw the light
No never saw the light
You let life pass on by
No you never realised
You got blinded by the ride

You bought the ticket
and took the ride (took the ride)
Trying to pry open wide
Your third eye
It's just fear and loathing
in disguise (in disguise)
There's nowhere to hide from your lies
We've all left your side
On your own, the curtain's closed

You burnout so bright
But you never saw the light
No never saw the light
You let life pass on by
No you never realised
You got blinded by the ride
You burnout so bright
But you never saw the light
You got blinded by the ride

You burnout so bright
But you never saw the light
No never saw the light
You let life pass on by
No you never realised
You got blinded by the ride
You burnout so bright
But you never saw the light
No never saw the light
You let life pass on by
No you never realised
You got blinded by the ride
