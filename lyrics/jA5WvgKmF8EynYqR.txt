Juno was mad;
He knew he'd been had
So he shot at the sun with a gun
Shot at the sun with a gun
Shot at his wily one only friend

In the gallows or the ghetto
In the town or the meadow
In the pillows even over the sun
Every end of the time is another begun

You understand
Mechanical hands
Are the ruler of everything (ahh)
Ruler of everything (ahh)
I'm the ruler of everything
In the end
(Backwards: Ohohohohohohoho he's a jack rabbit he's running away look at him he's jumping around!)

Do you like how I dance?
I've got zirconium pants!
Consequential enough
To slip you into a trance

Do you like how I walk?
Do you like how I talk?
Do you like how my face
Disintegrates into chalk?

I have a wonderful wife
I have a powerful job
She criticizes me for being egocentric (ha ha ha)

You practice your mannerisms
Into the wall
If this mirror were clearer
I'd be standing so tall

I saw you slobber over clovers on the side of the hill
I was observing the birds
Circle in for the kill

I've been you
I know you
Your facade is a scam

You know you're making me cry
This is the way that I am

I've been living a lie
A metamorphical scheme
Detective undercover brotherhood
Objective: obscene

Oh no, no
Oh yeah

Do you hear the flibbity jibbity jibber jabber
With an oh my god I've got to get out of here or I'll have another
Word to sell
Another story to tell
Another time piece ringing the bell
Do you hear the clock stop when you reach the end
No
You know it must be never ending
Comprehend if you can
But when you try to pretend to understand
You resemble a fool
Although you're only a man
So give it up and
Smile

Without looking down
Gliding around
Like a bumbling dragon I fly
Scraping my face on the sky

Oh no, no
Oh yeah
