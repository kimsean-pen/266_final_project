Run, run, run far from me
I feel your hunger
I'm trying, trying, trying to keep you away but I -
This feeling's stronger

Should I go? (escaping me)
Let me go (?)

I'm howling like a wolf
I'm shouting at my soul
I'm flirting with the moon
I'm calling out to you
Cos I'm howling like a wolf

Hide, hide, hide, hide away
But you will find me
We're hoping, hoping, hoping love will find a way
But that will not be easy

I'm howling like a wolf
I'm shouting at my soul
I'm flirting with the moon
I'm calling out to you
Cos I'm howling like a wolf

Now this curse is on you
I'm already bound to you
(?)

We're howling like the wolves
We're shouting at our souls
We're flirting with the moon
I'm calling out to you
Cos we're howling like the wolves
