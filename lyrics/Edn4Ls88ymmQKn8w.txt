I have waited for your love, for so long
How do I go on?
I have told you so many times, it's no good
You're treatin' me so wrong

Out there, so far away
Above, the sky will say
For you

Here it comes again
It's all around me
It must be magic
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I can see you in my mind
The lost time that you're savin'
I could reach out and touch you
What can I do? The sun ain't shinin'

Out there, so far away
Up above, the sky will say
For you, only for you

Here it comes again (Summer and lightning)
It's all around me (Summer and lightning)
It must be magic (Summer and lightning)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hear it comes again

I can feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
You

Here it comes again (Summer and lightning)
It's all around me (Summer and lightning)
It must be magic (Summer and lightning)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, here it comes again (Summer and lightning)
I can feel it (Summer and lightning)
It's all around me (Summer and lightning)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Summer and lightning)
