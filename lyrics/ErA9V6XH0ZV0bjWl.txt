Go Timbo
I'll be the same when it all goes up
I'll be the same when it all goes down
Not the first one open it up
I'll be the last one closing it out
Don't know if I'll give you a shot yet
Lil Mama, I'm peeping your style
Do I think you're dope enough? Yup
One way of finding it out
The way you came at me, boo
Don't care, not afraid, I'm like wild
Really want it from head to toe
Question if she gon' let it out
Anyway the hour glass go
I don't worry anyhow
Why don't we see where it go?

Let's figure it out
When the cats come out the vamps come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
In the morning after
When the cats come out the vamps come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah

In the morning after dark

Come on, SoShy

I got a little secret for ya

I never sleep when comes the night
But every time I smack my fingers
I switch back into the light
My moon belongs to your sun
Your fire is burning my mind
Is it love or is it lust?
Something that I just can't describe
Am I the one and only?
'Cause you're the only one
It felt so long and lonely
Waiting for you to come
It's looking bright and early
I'm willing to close my eyes

This is the unusual story
Timbo and SoShy
When the cats come out the vamps come out to play, yeah
In the morning after

The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
In the morning after
When the cats come out the vamps come out to play, yeah
In the morning after

The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah

In the morning after dark
Go Nelly
I need some REM but
I don't like sleeping alone

So come and pick me up as

Soon as you put down the phone
I wanna get into trouble
Later you'll carry me home
I wanna go undercover
I just wanna rattle your bones
Yes, I'm the one and only
But I'm not the only one
So let's work overtime on this shift
It ends with the sun

Maybe we can start a riot
Maybe we can run this town
Maybe I'll be your vampire
We could figure it out
When the cats come out the vamps come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah

In the morning after

When the cats come out the vamps come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
In the morning after dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, in the morning after dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, in the morning after dark
Please don't leave me, girl, in the morning after dark
Please don't leave me, girl, in the morning after dark
Please don't leave me, girl
When the cats come out the vamps come out to play
When the cats come out the vamps come out to play
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way
When the cats come out the bats come out to play
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way
