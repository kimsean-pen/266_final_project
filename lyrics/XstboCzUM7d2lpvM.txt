Once
In the darkness
Of bad memories
You stepped into a trap
But the spring-loaded bar
Didn't break your neck
And you remained there

Waiting for the better time

Life
With your passivity
In the face of choices
Forced you to turn back
Settle with your lies
But the stubborn glass
Doesn't want to talk to you

Waiting for the better time
Chair bound and bedridden heart

Discard your fear of the unknown
Be here and now
Just find yourself in peace
Try to free your mind
Wake up
Get unstuck
Let it go
Send your shame to nevermore

Your past
Your distorted thoughts
Closed you in the box
And cluttered up your head
Hewn from happiness
In your fable town
You're still afraid of-

Starting something new this life

Discard your fear of the unknown
Be here and now
Just find yourself in peace
Try to free your mind
Wake up... Let it go
Try to free your mind
Get unstuck
Let it go
Send your shame to nevermore
Send your shame to nevermore

Discard your fear of the unknown
Be here and now
Just find yourself in peace
Try to free your mind
Wake up
Get unstuck
Let it go
Send your shame to nevermore
Let it go
Scare away your fear no more
Fear of new life
Fear of days of the unknown
Fear of new life
Fear of days of the unknown
Fear of new life
Fear of days of the unknown
Fear of new life
No more fear of love
