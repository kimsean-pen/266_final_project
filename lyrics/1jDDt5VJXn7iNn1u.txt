A drug for me

Ooh, are you ready now?

Kickstart my heart
Give it a start
Ooh, yeah, baby

Ooh, yeah, baby. Yeah!

Skydive naked
From an aeroplane
Or a lady with a
Body from outer space
My heart, my heart
Kickstart my heart

Trouble in my eyes

I'm just looking for Another good time
My heart, my heart

Kickstart my heart

When we started this band
All we needed, needed was a laugh
Years gone by...
I'd say we've kicked some ass

When I'm enraged
Or hittin' the stage
Adrenaline rushing
Through my veins

And I'd say we're still kickin' ass
Ooo, ahh, kickstart my heart
Hope it never stops
And to think, we did all of this...

To rock
Ooh, yeah

Kickstart my heart
Give it a start
Ooh, yeah, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Ooh, yeah

Kickstart my heart
Hope it never stops

Ooh, yeah, baby
Ooh, yeah

Kickstart my heart
Hope it never stops
Ooh, yeah, baby
Ooh, yeah
Kickstart my heart
Give it a start
Ooh, yeah
Ok boys, lets rock the house
That's all.
