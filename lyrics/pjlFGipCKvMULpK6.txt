Who will stand alone

She carried ribbons, she wore them out
Courage built a bridge, jealousy tore it down
At least it's something you've left behind
And like Kohoutek you were gone
We sat in the garden, we stood on the porch
I won't deny myself, we never talked

She wore bangles, she wore bells
On her toes and she jumped
Like a fish, like a flying friend
You were gone, like Kohoutek, can't forget that
Fever built a bridge, reason tore it down
If I am one to follow who will stand alone

Maybe you're not the problem, scissors, paper, stone
If you stand and holler, these prayers will talk
She carried ribbons, she wore them out
Michael built a bridge, Michael tore it down
At least it's something you've left behind
Like Kohoutek, you were gone

Michael built a bridge, Michael tore it down
If I stand and holler will I stand alone
