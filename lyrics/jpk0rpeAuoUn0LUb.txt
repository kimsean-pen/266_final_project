Brainwaves living in stills
Nightmares just floating on film
You found it in the white lies in the back of your mind
And you know it's not the same reel that you dusted off before
So slide it in a tape deck
Put it in a vcr
Show me how you got in this predicament
Did the devil let you down?
I could tell you it's the apex
I could tell you it's the Al hamra
Take another shot of your adrenaline
And pray you get that far
Sharp turns covered in skin
I bet the black gates just letting you in
You want another sure thing, a super 8 dream
But you know this aint a classic or one you've ever seen before

So slide it in a tape deck
Put it in a vcr
Show me how you got in this predicament
Did the devil let you down?
I could tell you it's the apex
I could tell you it's the Al hamra
Take another shot of your adrenaline
And pray you get that far
So slide it in a tape deck
Put it in a vcr
Show me how you got in this predicament
Did the devil let you down?
I could tell you it's the apex
I could tell you it's the Al hamra
Take another shot of your adrenaline
And pray you get that far
