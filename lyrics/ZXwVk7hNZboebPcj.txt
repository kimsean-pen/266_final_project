Learnin tricks in da trade in da ghetto state of mind till im rich and I'm paid pickin records
Like cotton in the thick of the day
Till I'm spoiled and I'm rotten and they send us away life no different that ozar minimum wage
Mo money but still locked in a similar cage either losers of tomorrow Now just that and there's
Really nothin missin to say but
