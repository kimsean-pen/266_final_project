Not this time, no,
We won't be alone in the end
Not this time, no
We won't give up on our path, no
Not this time, no,
We won't be alone in the end
Not this time, no
We won't give up on our path, no
Not this time, no,
We won't be alone in the end
Not this time, no
We won't give up on our path, no

Time for a change in this journey.
(We're) never afraid of
Writing new lines on this tale
Where we will dive... still it's unknown
But in the end
Everything will be given by faith

Your ideology can't stop the wheel of time.
Not even our dreams:
We will follow the signs

We don't need anything from you
It's the last hope in a world of hopes
Nothing will ever be the same...
But it's last hope in a world of hopes

So now we'll answer the calling
After our prayers
Your silly choice was giving it up

From ideologies we build our memories,
Growing with the scars,
We will follow the signs

We don't need anything from you
It's the last hope in a world of hopes
Nothing will ever be the same...
But it's last hope in a world of hopes

Nothing will ever be the same...
But it's the last hope in a world of hopes
