I can almost feel the tick like clockwork
Hearing all the voices in my head each time I go
There's a game they play that I'm not part of
Tearing at the weaknesses and all the faults they know

It's impossible to navigate around
It's inevitable that you'll fall in
It's improbable I'll ever come back down
I fell in and now I think I might drown

I'm falling deep into a pit of vipers
Over me, over me and I can't break free
Secrets run deep when you're in a pit of vipers
Slithering, whispering, feel the venom poisoning me

Now I must admit that I have played a part
In the way that things have gotten out of hand
But it's escalated almost to an art
I want to fix him but I don't think I can

I'm falling deep into a pit of vipers
Over me, over me and I can't break free
Secrets run deep when you're in a pit of vipers
Slithering, whispering, feel the venom poisoning me

Slither, slither, slither
Put your fangs into my back
Slither, slither, slither
Think I don't know where you're at

I use you, I'm no good, need to be in control
I said I use you, I'm no good, need to be in control

I'm falling deep into a pit of vipers
Over me, over me and I can't break free
Secrets run deep when you're in a pit of vipers
Slithering, whispering, feel the venom poisoning me

I'm falling deep into a pit of vipers
Over me, over me and I can't break free
Secrets run deep when you're in a pit of vipers
Slithering, whispering, feel the venom poisoning me

Slither, slither, slither
Put your fangs into my back
Slither, slither, slither
Think I don't know where you're at

I use you, I'm no good, need to be in control
I said I use you, I'm no good, need to be in control

This is how you make me feel
