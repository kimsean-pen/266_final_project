Build
A wall
Of books
Between us in our bed
Repeat
Repeat
The words that I know we both said
Relax
Into
The need
We get so comfortable
Remember
When
I was so strange and likable

I just want back in your head
I just want back in your head
I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray
When I get a little scared
When I get a little scared
When I get a little

When
I jerk
Away
From holding hands with you
I know
These habits hurt important parts of you
Remember when
How sweet and unexplainable
Nothing like this person, unlovable

I just want back in your head
I just want back in your head
I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray
When I get a little scared
When I get a little scared
When I get a little scared
When I get a little

Run, run, run
Run

Run, run, run
Run

I just want back in your head
I just want back in your head
I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray
I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray
I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray
I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray
