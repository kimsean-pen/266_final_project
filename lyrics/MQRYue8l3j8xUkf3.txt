English Translation

Stand by me

Look towards me
Even though I don't know love yet
Stand by me
Guard over me
Because I am still clumsy at love

My feelings get better as I look at you
I find myself randomly singing
I even want to buy a single rose
The side of myself is so new
As my heart becomes closer to you
The world become more beautiful
If you feel my nervousness
Will you wait just a little bit?

Forever making love
Forever making you smile
Filled with your bright smile
Forever making love
Forever making you smile
Now hold my hands
Stand by me
Look towards me
Even though I don't know love yet
Stand by me guard over me
Because I am still clumsy at love

The more I get to know you, my heart quivers
All I can do is smile
Shall I try to kiss you?
Will it get me a little closer to your heart?
Could this feeling be love
I'm still shy
I haven't even taken a single step to you
So please wait for my love

Together making love
Forever making you smile
Filled with your bright smile
Together making love
Forever making you smile
I will slowly heat towards you step by step
Stand by me
Look at me
Somehow, I want to be closer to you
Stand by me
Guard over me
I want to seem a bit cooler to you

I don't know at first
How to begin to love
I still don't know my heart
But I love you

Together making love
Forever making you smile
Filled with your bright smile
Together making love
Forever making you smile
Now hold my hands
Stand by me
Look towards me
Even though I don't know love yet
Stand by me guard over me
Because I am still clumsy at love
