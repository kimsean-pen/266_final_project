Sending shivers right down your spine
It's something that you're prone to, so divine
You were better at lies
(I was never surprised) at the way that it felt
Now feel the blade
(I was always insane) but you're the one that needs help

Quick
We have the ransom
Tell me how that you can swim
When ropes are wrapped around your limbs

Below
There's no more chances
So tell me how that you can swim
When ropes are wrapped around your limbs

Breathing slowly never worked for me
I cut the throat of betrayal to watch him bleed

A poetic sonnet
Passion that I scream to the sky
I'm tearing up
I feel your love
Don't leave me behind

A poetic sonnet
Passion that I scream to the sky
I'm tearing up
I feel your love
Don't leave me behind

The smell of vanity went away
I followed streetlights till I wound up at your place
We traced our veins
(We bled for days)
The current was strong enough tonight
I can't taste any more
It lasted on my tongue
You weren't strong enough to say...

Quick
We have the ransom
Tell me how that you can swim
When ropes are wrapped around your limbs

Below
There's no more chances
So tell me how that you can swim
When ropes are wrapped around your limbs

Grab my heart
Take us down
With your soul
And bury it in the ground

Go!

I talked to you today
I heard the tremble in your voice
Cradle the fall
I know you'll never change
So please just hold on
I know it's hard for you
It's hard to understand
Betrayal within
There is a fine line between betrayal
Betrayal and your friends

Tell me how that you can swim
With ropes wrapped around your limbs

Quick
We have the ransom
So tell me how that you can swim
When ropes are wrapped around your limbs
