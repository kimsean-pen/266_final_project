Take me where you want me lover
Take me where you want me
And in your darkest hour
I'll move through you

Tread carefully love
Tread carefully
Tread carefully love
Tread carefully

Have you ever seen her?
I've watched her burn
Have you ever seen her look like that?
I've watched her burn

Have you ever seen her?
I've watched her burn

Have you ever seen her look like that?
Have you ever seen her look like that?

Take me where you want me lover
Take me where you want me
And in your darkest hour
I'll move through you

Tread carefully love
Tread carefully
Tread carefully love

Have you ever seen her?
I've watched her burn
Have you ever seen her look like that?
I've watched her burn

Have you ever seen her?
I've watched her burn

Have you ever seen her look like that?
Have you ever seen her look like that?

And in your darkest hour
And in your darkest hour
In your darkest hour
(Don't say no)
And in your darkest hour
(Every way possible)
And in your darkest hour
