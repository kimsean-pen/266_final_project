Nobody Superstar

First you lie to yourself
Now you're selling it on t.v
Didn't know you'd go this far
Cultural deficiency
No price is too high
No moral's too low
This is the place you want to be
So you're ready to go
It's on with the show
No time to make apologies

Nobody Superstar
Laughing in the face of identity
Nobody Superstar
No price to high for you or me

Thrown the books
Off the shelf
And the world is at your feet
Who'd expect it would go this far
Irreversible insanity
No price is too high
No moral's too low
Show us want we want to see
Millions are watching, they all want to know
In the name of triviality

Nobody Superstar
Laughing in the face of identity
Nobody Superstar
No price to high for you or me

The cheaper the glory
The better the story

Screams of the greedy
You'll always be needing

Like bees to the honey
You've got all the money

Someone's gonna kick you in the teeth now!
