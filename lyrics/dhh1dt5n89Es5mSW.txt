All is fair in love and war but all I do is love you more.
Our love is crazy, unhealthy
but I can't keep from you baby.
So you said: "Why even bother?"

Set this love, set me on fire
how I wish.
You'd be the victim
So you'd see

Just how I'm feelin
You better know know know
That I have conditions
I make the rules and make the decisions

And I-I-I want nothing less than
What I deserve
So you better run run run
Before I decide that

You are mine two stars will collide
You better run run run
Nowhere to run
But to me
Somehow I don't get the picture

Don't know why you are the winner
Our love is not what we wanted
but baby you finish just what you started
So you said, "Why even bother"

Set this love set me on fire
How I wish
You'd know we better
So you'd see that I'm a transetter

You better know know know
That I have conditions
I make the rules and make the decisions
And I-I-I want nothing less than

What I deserve
So you better run run run
Before I decide that
You are mine two stars will collide
You better run run run

Nowhere to run
But to me
You are the cause of all this pain
But you are the reason I'm upset

You are the cause of all this pain
But you are the cause of all this love
You are the thing I can't forget
You better know know know

That I have conditions
I make the rules and make the decisions
And I-I-I want nothing less than
What I deserve

So you better run run run
Before I decide that
You are mine two stars will collide
You better run run run

Nowhere to run
But to me
You better know know know
That I have conditions

I make the rules and make the decisions
And I-I-I want nothing less than
What I deserve
So you better run run run
Before I decide that
You are mine two stars will collide
You better run run run
Nowhere to run
But to me
You better know know know
That I have conditions
I make the rules and make the decisions
And I-I-I want nothing less than
What I deserve
So you better run run run
Before I decide that
You are mine two stars will collide
You better run run run
Nowhere to run
But to me
