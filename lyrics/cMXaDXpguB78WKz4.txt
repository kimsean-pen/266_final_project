There's a voice from clear across the plains
With an accent that you can't mistake
But this song, it don't take place in Texas
It's in a landlocked type of state

And the statics humming me to sleep
On the floor, the only way to beat the heat
This is why I don't write you letters
They never mention these things

You can take another hit but (you can try and top it)
Try and hold your breath (it's just another hit in)
Vain, I've got a grasp on my own isolation
An abridged adaptation of it

The insanity we can't escape
Losing brain cells and the Teflon flakes
I got my own way of fighting cancer
And you ain't one of them

Stealing groceries just to stay awake
Sleepwalk through the aisles to numb the ache
Can you hide it inside your jacket
And make a quick escape?

You can lie about the price of (keeping it inside it's)
Not the greatest gig but (can't you see I'm trying)
Not to bum you out, I feel so sick inside
I'm just trying to hide out lately

Blurry visions from the karaoke prompter
Nodding off to not so distant laughter
They're gonna watch you die from starvation
And your scars will all have names
