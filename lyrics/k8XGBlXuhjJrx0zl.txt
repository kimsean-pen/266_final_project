I used to dream myself
To somewhere else each night
I dreamed in color
Caused i lived in black and white
Until i chanced upon this road that led to you
I could not see
How anything could be

Better than a dream
Stranger than my wild imagination
If this is a real sensation
It's better than a dream
Higher than the moon
Hazy like a beautiful illusion
Crazy and in confusion
And better than a dream

I used to wish
I was beyond some distant door
I knew there must be more to life
And now I'm sure
No dreams of pirate caves
Or Indian braves
Or magic carpets could
Ever be this good

Better than a dream
Stranger than my wild imagination
If this is a real sensation
It's better than a dream
Higher than the moon
Hazy like a beautiful illusion
Crazy and in confusion
And better than a dream
And better than a dream
