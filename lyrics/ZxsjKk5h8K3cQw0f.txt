Summer's gone and you're sleeping, felt the glow wash away from your skin
City stripped of an outcome, dead air rising up to no one
Baby, I can't live like that, caught down wind from a last breath
Break your fame playing basements, write your name across the pavement
Between an age and a movement, can't find a place to end or begin
Held one screen to another, nothing left to uncover

Can't hardly wait for all of those "better days, better days, better days"
Maybe it's not too late to learn how to celebrate, celebrate

It's all the same when you're under, sthe shade from the hole I've been in
Script a soul for an outcome, can't make due with what's been undone
Honey, I can tell you're something, always chasing the wrong thing
Couldn't see until I dreamed it, who have thought I'd never need it

Can't hardly wait for all of those "better days, better days, better days"
Maybe it's not too late to learn how to celebrate, celebrate
