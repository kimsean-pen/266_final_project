The heading is leave the hurting
Drain it up is the world
It's bleeding for too long
After this daze, I wash my hands
Could you take my name for another one?
And don't know how
Can a turn here
overcome me
They just want for me
The things they never had

There's a movement in the water
Glass is broken, cutting and hurting again
I light a match every single morning
Glass is broken cutting and hurting again
