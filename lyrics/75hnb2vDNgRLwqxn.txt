Take away
Our love
My love
For you

Wide awake
You hang
My every move

Bring me back
To who I was before
Stay away
I don't belong to you

Ohh Ahh
Ohh Ahh
Ohh Ahh
Ohh Ahh

Take away
Take away the pain
Give me back my heart
I can't live without it
Don't wanna love again
(Take away)
Take away the day
I gave my heart away
You never deserved it
Take away

Learn the lo-nely me
To see my own
Maybe so I fall for you
No more

Gravity
Just pulled me back to go
Tragedy
My heart just turn to stone

Ohh Ahh
Ohh Ahh
Ohh Ahh
Ohh Ahh

Take away
Take away the pain
Give me back my heart
I can't live without it
Don't wanna love again
(Take away)
Take away the day
I gave my heart away
You never deserved it

Take away
Take away
Take away
Take away

I forget this place
I refuse to stay
I forget your face
Never turn your face at me

I forget this place
I refuse to stay
I forget your face
Never turn your face at me

I forget this place
I refuse to stay
I forget your face
Never turn your face at me

I forget this place
I refuse to stay
I forget your face
Never turn your face at me

I forget this place
I refuse to stay
I forget your face
Never turn your face at me

I forget this place
I refuse to stay
I forget your face
Never turn your face at me
