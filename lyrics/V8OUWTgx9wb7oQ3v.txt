Something in my heart is gone
Something that was mine all along
So let the silence of the night
My hopes get decide
I see love
Though it keeps me going on
Keeps me going on
But if you don't feel the same
Why won't you leave
Leave for someone better
You won't see me again
Touch me again
Feel me again
So why you bother
Why won't you leave
Leave for someone better
You won't see me again
Touch me again
Feel me again
So why you bother
I can see the love in your eyes
It's too fuck on
And I can't decide
But we can have it all
We can have it all
Like an essy way out
It kept me going on
It kept me going on
But if you don't feel the same
Why won't you leave
Leave for someone better
You won't see me again
Touch me again
Feel me again
So why you bother
Why won't you leave
Leave for someone better
You won't see me again
Touch me again
Feel me again
So why you bother
Why won't you
Why won't you
