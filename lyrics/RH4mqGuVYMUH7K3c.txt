I had a dream which was not all a dream:
The sun was extinguished,
And, the stars wandered dark-ling in space,
Ray-less, and pathless.
And, the icy Earth swung blind and blackened in the moonless air.
And, men forgot their passions in the dread
Of this, their desolation.
And, all hearts were chilled into a selfish prayer for light:
They did live by watchfires,
And, the throats of crowned kings.
Habitations of all things which dwell
Were burnt for beacons.

(Oh, Lord)
I lack strength (I lack strength)
To turn and leave you.
There's no confidence (I lack strength)
In my hesitation.

Happy were those who dwelt within the eye of the volcanoes.
Their mountain-torch: A fearful hope was all the world contained.
Forests were set on fire,
But, hour by hour, they fell and faded.
The crackling trunks extinguished with a crash,
And all was black.
The brows of men, by the despairing light, wore an unearthly aspect.
The flashes fell upon them; Some lay down, and hid their eyes,
And some did rest their chins upon their clenched hands, and smiled.

(Oh, Lord)
I lack strength (I lack strength)
To turn and leave you.
There's no confidence (I lack strength)
In my hesitation.

She was the universe.
She was the universe.

And, vipers crawled,
And twined themselves among the multitude,
Hissing, but sting-less.
They were slain for food --
A meal was bought with blood.
And each sat apart,
Gorging himself in gloom.
No love was left.

(Oh, Lord)
I lack strength (I lack strength)
To turn and leave you.
There's no confidence (I lack strength)
In my hesitation.

(Oh, Lord)
I lack strength (I lack strength)
To turn and leave you.
There's no confidence (I lack strength)
In my hesitation.
