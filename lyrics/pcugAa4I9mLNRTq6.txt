Some day you will grow up and learn to lie.
Just like your daddy did when he told you no one ever really dies.
I hope I'm not there when you realize,
those with their nose in the air will never look you in the eye.

And you will go toe to toe,
like David and Goliath.
Who will be Goliath?
And will you throw the stone?
"I don't know, yeah, I don't know," said the man with all of the answers.
If he don't have the answers, how will I ever know?

I knew an old man with nothing to do but wait.
He invited himself, and he still showed up late.
When it came to the end of the night he would always overstate.
But I never had a reason to complain 'til the day he stopped coming by and I missed his company.

And you will go toe to toe,
like David and Goliath.
They will be Goliath,
and you will throw the stone.
"I don't know, yeah, I don't know," said the man with all of the answers.
If he don't have the answers, how will I ever know?

And I don't care what you do with the little time every gets,
as long as you do the math, choose a path that will never hurt anyone else.
Although they'll hurt you, make them sure they've earned you.
They will not forget.

Some day I will find you and stop on by.
And you'll say, "How have you been?"
And I'll say, "I've been fine."
And we will both know that it's a lie.
Turns out what I figured out was I was wrong and you were right.

And you will go toe to toe,
like David and Goliath.
They will be Goliath.
And you will throw the stone.
"I don't know, yeah, I don't know," said the man with all of the answers.
If he don't have the answers, how will I ever know?
