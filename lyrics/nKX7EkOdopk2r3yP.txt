Now that the time had come
Waiting it seems like forever
Gather your broken dreams
And put all the pieces together

And everyone will see what you were meant to be, oh
All of the glamour and all of the fame
People are gonna remember your name
Now and forever, your dreams coming true
They're gonna love it, whatever you do

Gonna love you as you are
Gonna love you, you're a superstar
Gonna love you as you are
Gonna love you, you're a superstar

Here is where you belong
Planets align for this moment
Singing the sweetest song
A melody full of emotion

Sacrifices made were never sacrificed in vain
Such a small price to pay, yesterday
