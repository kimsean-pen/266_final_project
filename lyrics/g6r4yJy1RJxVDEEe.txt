I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying "Is it right or is it wrong?"
If only Fame had an IV baby could I bare
Being away from you I found the vein, put it in here

I live for the Applause, Applause, Applause
I live for the Applause-plause
Live for the Applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The Applause, Applause, Applause

Give me the thing that I love
(Turn the lights on)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
(Make it real loud)
Give me the thing that I love
(Turn the lights on)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
(Make it real loud)

A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Make it real loud
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Make it real loud
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

I've overheard your theory; nostalgia's for geeks
I guess sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Kunst, then suddenly the Kunst is me
Pop culture was in Art now ART's in POP culture, in me!

I live for the Applause, Applause, Applause
I live for the Applause-plause
Live for the Applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The Applause, Applause, Applause

Give me the thing that I love
(Turn the lights on)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
(Make it real loud)
Give me the thing that I love
(Turn the lights on)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
(Make it real loud)

A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Make it real loud
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Make it real loud
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

Touch touch
Touch touch now
I live for the Applause, Applause, Applause
I live for the Applause-plause
Live for the Applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The Applause, Applause, Applause

Give me the thing that I love
(Turn the lights on)
Put your hands up, make 'm touch
(Make it real loud)
Give me the thing that I love
(Turn the lights on)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
(Make it real loud)

A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Make it real loud
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
Make it real loud (A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E)
Make it real loud
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-R-T-P-O-P
