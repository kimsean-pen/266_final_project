Fly-pitcher run
'cause I hear them sirens cry out.
Leave no trace of where you've gone
I ain't the one to point you out.

'Cause together in concrete we stand
In this broken land.

Gold why do you aspire to gold?
Why not something higher?

Clasp knife close
'Cause life is too fragile to follow your code.
Blue devils be told
To leave us alone.

One day the cherry blossoms will unfold
Tongues will roll
And truth be told.

Gold why do you aspire to gold?
Why not something higher?
