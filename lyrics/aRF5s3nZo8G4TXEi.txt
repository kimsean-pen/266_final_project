Mind it wanders far away
Feeling in love but I just can't stay
Searching magic every day
Cross the ocean through the haze

Take me back ocean blue bring me home
Memories and mysteries point to you
Take me back ocean blue bring me home
Memories and mysteries point to you

Pull my body to the shore
But I don't live here anymore
See you turn and speak to me
Just hear whispers of the sea

Take me back ocean blue bring me home
Memories and mysteries point to you
Take me back ocean blue bring me home
Memories and mysteries point to you
Dreaming I am going home

Dead lights, sweet surprise
See the mourning in her eyes
Don't look back, just cut me loose
Keep on searching, find the truth

Take my hand tonight and see the passage shining bright
Eclipsing everything we know

Take my hand tonight and see the passage shining bright
Eclipsing everything we know

Take my hand tonight and see the passage shining bright
Eclipsing everything we know

Take my hand tonight and see the passage shining bright
Eclipsing everything we know
