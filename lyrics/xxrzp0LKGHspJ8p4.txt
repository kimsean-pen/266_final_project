I know one day, all our scars will disappear
Like the stars at dawn and all of our pain
Will fade away when morning comes

And on that day when we look backwards we will see
That everything is changed and all of our trials
Will be as milestones on the way

And as long as we live
Every scar is a bridge to someone's broken heart
And there's no greater love
Than that one shed his blood for his friends

On that day all of the scales will swing to set
All the wrongs to right, all of our tears
All of our fears will take to flight

But until then all of our scars will still remain
We've learned that if we'll open the wounds
And share them then soon they start to heal

(As long as we live, we are bridges to someone's broken heart)
And as long as we live
Every scar is a bridge to someone's broken heart
(There's no greater love, shed your blood for your friends)
And there's no greater love
Than that one shed his blood for his friends

We must see that every scar is a bridge
And as long as we live we must open up these wounds
When some one stands in your shoes
And will shed his own blood, there's no greater love
We must open up our wounds
