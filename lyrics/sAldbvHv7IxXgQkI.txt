Father, I'm better than butterfly
You can have soul
What you need isn't me
You can die
No matter
I'm better, Father, than butterfly
You can't die
Should wanna feel like a child
You don't know if I'm alive

Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive

So what you lit grows in me
You can buy rather
And, Father, I'm better than lullaby
I should drive
Should wanna feel like a child
Don't even know if I'm alive

Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive
