No matter how many times that you told me you wanted to leave
No matter how many breaths that you took you still couldn't breathe
No matter how many nights that you'd lie
wide awake to the sound of the poison rain
Where did you go, where did you go, where did you go

As the days go by the night's on fire

Tell me would you kill to save a life
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right
Crash crash
Burn let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground

No matter how many deaths that I die I will never forget
No matter how many lives I live I will never regret
There is a fire inside of this heart
and a riot about to explode into flames
Where is your god, where is your god, where is your god

Do you really want, do you really want me
Do you really want me dead
Or alive to torture for my sins
Do you really want
Do you really want me
Do you really want me dead
Or alive to live a lie

Tell me would you kill to save a life
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right
Crash crash
Burn let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground

The promises we made were not enough
The prayers that we had prayed were like a drug
The secrets that we sold were never known
The love we had the love we had
We had to let it go

Tell me would you kill to save a life
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right
Crash crash
Burn let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground

This hurricane
This hurricane
This hurricane

Do you really want, do you really want me
Do you really want me dead
Or alive to torture for my sins
Do you really want
Do you really want me
Do you really want me dead
Or alive to live a lie
