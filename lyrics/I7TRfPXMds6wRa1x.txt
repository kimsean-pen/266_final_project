All eyes see
Such shattered scenes
Of sorry surrender

Secrecy, an empire bleeds
Its fallen pretenders

Fear the isolation
Returning life it dies in the dark

The fear it yearns
The years they burn

All my dreams
A make believe
A sorry endeavour

Self-esteems entire need
Demolished forever

The fear it yearns
The years they burn
Until the hour we adapt
Until the hour we collapse
