It's so easy when you're fake believing
Untruly speaking, wrecking feelings
It's so easy sparking opposite ends
Fighting the good within
Hiding my reasons

Stranger I know so well
You got me tripping over myself
Can't trust in you
'Cause as I reach for your hand
I still sink into quicksand
Isn't my good side worth rescuing?

It's not easy admitting your demons
Tangled up in seasons
Finding lame reasons
I can't fall asleep but I sure can dream

Stranger I know so well
You got me tripping over myself
Can't trust in you
'Cause as I reach for your hand
I still sink into quicksand
Isn't my good side worth rescuing?

I always flip myself into a shape I can't make
Thinking so hard about who we really are
You spark the good within
But I was never good at listening
Listen until you're gone
(Stranger I know so well)

Stranger I know so well
You got me tripping over myself
Can't trust in you (Oh, you know I want to)
'Cause as I reach for your hand
I still sink into quicksand
Isn't my good side worth rescuing?

Stranger I know so well
Stranger I know so well
Stranger I know so well
Isn't my good side worth rescuing?
