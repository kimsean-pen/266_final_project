surely there is
no substitute
for company
my moms ripping
off her hands
one flake at a time
all her children left the house
and left her all alone
but just like she'd tell me
things get better
just wait
and youll see

take one day at a time
everything else you can leave behind
only one thing at a time
anything more really hurts your mind
i dont want for us to
take pills
anymore
not that its bad
i dont want for us to take pills
because were stronger
and we dont need them
