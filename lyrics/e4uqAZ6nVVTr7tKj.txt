I twist and turn
In the darkest space
Can't find my worth
As I numb the pain

Glass to the sky
With a black tooth grin
This whiskey smile
Takes me down again

I'm cold and I'm so afraid
That I'm too weak

And I can't change
I've been buried alive

And I don't want
To be here anymore

Reached out
A thousand times

For a hand to
Pull me from below

I've been buried alive
In a world of
Constant sorrow
Reached down tonight

And set me free
Save tomorrow
Another shot
Slip into the haze

Another night
Soaked in my disgrace

Toast to the lie
I'll raise my glass and run
A wasted life
What've I become?

I've been buried alive
And I don't want
To be here anymore
Reached out
A thousand times
For a hand to
Pull me from below
I've been buried alive
In a world of
Constant sorrow
Reached out tonight
And set me free
Save tomorrow
(Save tomorrow
Save tomorrow)
-Solo-
Let me breathe again
And show me where I begin
(Where I begin)
To find a will to change
Before I lose everything
(Before I lose everything)
I've been buried alive
And I don't want
To be here anymore
Reached out
A thousand times
For a hand to
Pull me from below
I've been buried alive
In a world of
Constant sorrow
Reached out tonight
And set me free
And I will follow
I've been buried alive
I've been buried alive
I've been buried alive
