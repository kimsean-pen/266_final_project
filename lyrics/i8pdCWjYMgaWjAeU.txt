Baby, have you seen, there is a snake in our paradise
A serpent that's wriggling between us
and freezing our feelings to ice

And with each drop of blood we bleed because of this
something so precious dies and it feels it really is...

Killing Me Killing You
Killing all we have
As our loves wither away

Burning Me Burning You
Burning us to ash
Drowning us in a sea of flames

Darling, do you feel, there is a storm coming our way
The burning light between us is already starting to fade
And with each drop of blood our shattered hearts ever bleed
something so precious dies and is lost eternally

Killing Me Killing You
Killing all we have

As our loves wither away
Burning Me Burning You
Burning us to ash

Drowning us in a sea of flames
Each teardrop from your eyes
makes something inside me die

Each of these days that draws us part
takes a piece from my heart
Kill me kill me kill me again with your love
and chase the storm away

Bring me bring me bring me the end with your love
and haunt the demons away
Killing Me Killing You
Killing all we have

As our loves wither away
Burning Me Burning You
Burning us to ash
Drowning us in a sea of flames
Killing me, killing you
killing all we have
As our love withers away
Burning me, burning you
Burning us to ash
Drowning us in a sea of flames
Kill me, kill me, kill me again with your love and chase the snake away
Bring me, bring me, bring me the end with your love and haunt the demons away
