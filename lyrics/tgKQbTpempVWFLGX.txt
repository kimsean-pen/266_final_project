Fuzzy white haze in the asphalt was a lake
And the sand it was a grayer shade of blue
Spirits held desire while my eyes they did admire
The evening that we only thought we knew

Further out to sea I heard the birds wings over me
the Vibrations in the air to my ears
The sun was rising slinking low the day was saddled up to go
The desert's lonely nightfall disappears

The raven who flies through the desert skies
Is wiser than you or me
The birds have a peace, the stillness a sleeve
And the Desert Raven he has poetry

Close your eyes and fly to let the diamonds make the night
Crystal blue will turn to ruby red
The plants become a maze under the heavens stary hazel
Pegasus he gallops overhead

The buffalo at night they follow close the river's edge while
saffron slowly grows inside the caves
The starry minds of hyacinth the moon below the sun's eclipse
The sandy canyon floats beyond the waves

The raven who flies through the desert skies
Is wiser than you or me
The birds have a peace, the stillness a sleeve
And the Desert Raven he has poetry
