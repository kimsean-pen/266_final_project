i bet you feel a little sad, are you a little bit angry?
you know im always late, just promise you dont hate me?
i guess im just a tad irresponsible
with all this inconsistent push and pull,
to gauge the weight of things i say is nearly impossible...

and it was just another mountain to
climb with variables, and you,
if youd known exactly what to do-
you wouldve, you couldnt.

and it was just another night,
the way it looked on the edge of the light,
a memory, a feeling of a time
when i felt fine.
i'll pack it up and i'll go home,
cause im never gonna win and i dont know
if you're ever gonna let me in.
are you ever gonna let me in on whats happening?

and there's this kid this is the song i never gave him,
i wrote a fast one i never thought he'd want a slow one.
always got some problem,
i hate to say it but it takes one to know one
and i am in the same boat,
and its leaking from different holes,
and i am of that same note, i wait patiently, it implodes.

and it was just another mountain
to climb with variables, and you,
if youd known exactly what to do-
you wouldve, you couldnt.

and it was just another night,
the way it looked on the edge of the light,
a memory, a feeling of a time
when you felt fine.
you'll pack it up and you'll go home,
because you're never gonna win and you dont know,
if you're ever gonna find the right friends?
or the right girl? its not living, this cycle.

its hard to believe what im never gonna see
and accept all the things that i'll never be.
found an old photograph of you and me f
rom some day that we spent laying out on the beach.
and with every photo i have to look underneath
cause nothing is ever as it seems, you know what i mean?
like i didnt smile, cause i forgot to breathe,
too consumed with the thought that we'd have to leave.
