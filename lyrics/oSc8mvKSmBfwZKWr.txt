I jumped the 45 to meet you later
So we could have all night long
You've never looked so inviting
As tonight babe
Glad it's me who takes you home

But I think you'll be the death of me
You always seem to have the best of me
It's hard to know
It's so hard to tell
When your heart is right on the carousel
On the carousel

Feels like I'm eroding
But I'm melting
Lights become a lucid dream
Well my heart's imploding
I can barely breathe

But I think you will be the death of me
You always seem to have the best of me
It's hard to know
It's so hard to tell
When your heart is right on the carousel
On the carousel

Can't get enough
Can't get enough of you babe
Can't get enough abuse
My body's not
Oh and my mind is aching
Can't get enough abuse

But I think you'll be the death of me
You always seem to have the best of me
It's hard to know
It's so hard to tell
When your heart is right on the carousel
On the carousel
