Don't make it obvious, it's cool that you copy us,
in cahoots with the mafia, the art I make is over basquiate,
Quote me on that, put a dead homie on that,
I'm from a whole nother batch of people with
influence they usually know me from that, or hold me on that,
That Ego,
Knock it back, drama queen or hypercondriact, hero, none of that,
even if I was a runinning back, ain't no energy,
for my enemy threading it carefully you ain't no friend to me how
do you better me, aiming for a jigga like the killer did to Kennedy

How you feel how you feel,
I think imma make the earth shake,
break it down break it down, watch the work rate
How you feel how you feel,
I think imma make the earth shake,
break it down break it down, watch the work rate

I really wanna run it fast for the fans
cause I'm always too tense, impressive ain't it,
So I might do it for a second as veteran I'm better with a flow,
you can only meddle with the notes,
put a bit of a what a jigga know I don't wanna lose I don't wanna go
so I bend the rules in the booth man I might fight with the right mic,
even with a winter coat man I'm still cold,
jigga that's bragging rights, I ain't even bragging right,
don't even do fashion right,
flashing lights but a jigga not flashing right,
We go where the ego grows,
we know we don't see a lot of home grown folks with a stone
cold flow, please note, the accolades don't add to the zeros

How you feel how you feel,
I think imma make the earth shake,
break it down break it down, watch the work rate
How you feel how you feel,

I had to switch it on em, quick shift man I'm drifting on em,
I don't do road, I don't do codes,
I don't do nothing that keeps me in a box,
but I throw rocks and I don't knock,
I just be busting off all these locks,
yeah I got guns but I don't cock, woah!
Pacifist activist, passing the pacific, dont piss me, off again,
I'm off again, I'm worth more than what they offering,
you better not try forget, call again,
I don't do jogging bro I'm walking it,
tooth so sweet but I'm better with
oranges, I'll OD if I'm given the sauce again
