I like your toothy smile,
it never fails to beguile
Whichever way the wind is blowing
I like the way this is going

I like the color of your hair,
I think we make a handsome pair.
I can only see my love growing
I like the way this is going

I like to watch TV with you,
there's really nothing i would rather do
Then maybe we can go to bed,
get up and do it all again

I like the way your pants fit,
how you stand and how you sit,
whatever seeds that you're sowing,
I like the way this is going

I don't care about the past,
none of it was made to last,
it's not what who you've known,
but who you're knowing

I like the way this is going
I like the way this is going
