Love, oh, love, oh careless love
Love, oh, love, oh careless love
Love, oh, love, oh careless love
You see what love has done to me

I'd love my mama and papa too
I'd love my mama and papa too
I'd love my mama and papa too
I'd leave them both to go with you

What, oh what, will mama say
What, oh what, will mama say
What, oh what, will mama say
When she learns I've gone astray

Once I wore my apron low
Once I wore my apron low
Once I wore my apron low
I couldn't scarcely keep you from my door

Now my apron strings don't pin
Now my apron strings don't pin
Now my apron strings don't pin
You pass my door and you don't come in
