In the ocean we can barely float
In the ocean further down we go
I don't want to know your motive

Come and stay another moment
Stay another moment
Drifting down and we don't wash ashore
Come and stay another moment
Stay another moment
Pull me down
Down to your ocean floor

In the ocean follow where you go
Your devotion is sinking down below
I don't want know your motive

Come and stay another moment
Stay another moment
Drifting down and we don't wash ashore
Come and stay another moment
Stay another moment
Pull me down
Down to your ocean floor

Famous for the way I've fallen
Fading love take me down to the bottom
Failing lungs the more i swallow
Wading once but now we're underwater

Come and stay another moment
Stay another moment
Drifting down and we don't wash ashore
Come and stay another moment
Stay another moment
Pull me down
Down to your ocean floor
