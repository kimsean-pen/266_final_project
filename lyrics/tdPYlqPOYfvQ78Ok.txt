My girls been goin 'round talkin'
They say that you been watchin' me, boy
I know, by the way you're talkin'
That you're really tryin' to get to me, boy

Not anyone I'll just let in my heart
You have to be hungry for me
Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
What makes me think
That I can say this to you?
I know how bad you want this

If you want my future then
You better work it, boy
No, it won't come easy, no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be beggin' me for more

Come on
You want this?

Come on, dance
Come on, dance
Come on, dance
Come on, dance

I know your whole story
Because you're fine and, and you know it
You think that you can have me
Just listen closely, no it ain't so easy
Every word, you've said I have heard before

Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
One thing I've been told
Nothin' else compares
To this lovin' body

If you want my future then
You better work it, boy
No, it won't come easy, no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be beggin' me for more
So you want my lovin', no
I know you want this

If you want my future then
You better work it, boy
No, it won't come easy, no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be beggin' me for more
