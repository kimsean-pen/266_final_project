You escaped like a runaway train
Off the tracks and down again
And my heart's beating like a steam boat tugging all your burdens

On my shoulders

In the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning all my worries.
Now there's nothing but time that's wasted

And words that have no backbone
And now it seems like the whole world's waiting
Can you hear the echoes fading?
In the mourning I'll rise

In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning all my sorries.
And it takes all my strength not to dig you up
From the ground in which you lay

The biggest part of me
You were the greatest thing
And now you're just a memory
To let go of.
In the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning all my sorries.
In the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning all my sorries.
