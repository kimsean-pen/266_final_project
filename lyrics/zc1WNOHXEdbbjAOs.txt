Hey there what's that in your sky
With all the pretty lights
You think I can get that high?

Hey you man, where's your motivation
And why the celebration
You've gotten nothing done here

You wanna live until you
Die alone and will
And I can fly alone and will
I'm not so far below
I live beneath your sky
With tainted eyes,
I've made my mind
To live until I die

Run run run catch me if you can can can
Come and hold my hand and I'll be your biggest fan
Followers living in your hollow words
I have seen your nine to fives
Wash away your dreams

You wanna live until you
Die alone and will
And I can fly alone and will
I'm not so far below
I live beneath your sky
With tainted eyes,
I've made my mind
Hey I'm just fine with all my time
To live until I die
