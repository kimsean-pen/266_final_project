The time of your life, shame you have to go.
I can see your eyes, the tiny teardrops fall.
Move in front of the light and you pass from out of sight.
As if you went somewhere.

End of the line, turn around and go
Somewhere you ain't been, somewhere you don't know.
A hundred thousand lights still shimmering tonight.
You have to go somewhere.

And I feel tonight, and I wonder why.
And I feel tonight and I wonder why.
