want to follow me?
lets keep it chasing
our little secret is the space between us melting
I think it's happening
devise a solid plan
it's gonna run loose
a sudden short fuse
I never thought that this was something we could ever choose
I know i'II come to
we've got the upper hand

and it runs real deep,
to a closer fit,
at a slight degree,
one could glisten over it, and if I
never told them nothing then they wouldn't have hell to pay
cause we dwell so hard,
on the slightest touch,
and I ran so far,
just to miss something so much, and so I
never would have said it if they saw me yesterday

another place to go?
I didn't think so,
beating on the marble counterfeit a no show
you wanna head home,
we've got some work to do
I signal same lines
when Jimmi seems fine
the combination of embracing all our past times
see into my mind,
I want to smother you

and it runs real deep,
to a closer fit,
at a slight degree,
one could glisten over it, and if I
never told them nothing then they wouldn't have hell to pay
cause we dwell so hard,
on the slightest touch,
and I ran so far,
just to miss something so much, and so I
never would have said it if they saw me yesterday

you know me fists clinched in an altercation
and I'm screaming in my dreams like it's going in and out of fashion
so put your faces up
you're pretty lovable

and it runs real deep,
to a closer fit,
at a slight degree,
one could glisten over it, and if I
never told them nothing then they wouldn't have hell to pay
cause we dwell so hard,
on the slightest touch,
and I ran so far,
just to miss something so much, and so I
never would have said it if they saw me yesterday
