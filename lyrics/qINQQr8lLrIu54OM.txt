You take on me,
And break apart the everything that makes me man
So i want you to leave
If i ever want to restore my sanity, oh.
Baby look at me, I'm the fool
I tear myself in two, for the vision of me and you
Baby don't you know
Every time you come around, girl you got me thinking
That I'm gonna lose it
And every time I talk to you, you better listen
Cause you need to chose between
The things that will lift you up, and will break you down
Oh, baby don't you know, yeah
Just listen to the words that I got to say
You want to do it on your own,
And go about it your way
I don't suggest that you, walk that path alone
You don't have the protection or the knowledge, girl
To prevent you from the bad harm of the world
I wanna say that you're, more than welcome to leave with me.
oh.
But, now baby don't you know your man's a fool
I tear myself in two, for the vision of lovin' you.
Every time you come around, girl you got me thinking
I'm gonna loose it
And every time I talk to you, you better listen
Cause you need to choose between
The things that will lift you up, and will break you down
oh, baby don't you know, yeah
Stop, wait, slow down a minute, you're moving too fast baby.
Stop, wait, slow down a minute, you're movin'
You wanna, don't you wanna just, slow it down, for the sake of you mercy, girl?
Don't you, don't you, don't you wanna slow it down?
Now you know
Every time I talk to you, you better listen
Cause you need to choose between,
The things that will lift you up, and will wither your soul
Cause girl you'd better know now
Every time I talk to you, you better listen
Cause you need to choose between
The things that will lift you up, and will wither your soul
Cause girl you'd better know now
Every time I talk to you, you better listen
Cause girl you'd better choose what is right for you baby.
