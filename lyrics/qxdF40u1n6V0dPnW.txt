I'm feeling happy so highly evolved
my time's a riddle that will never be solved
dreamin for somethin
reachin for somethin
just waitin for the sun to carry me in

if you feel low
you can buy love
from a payphone
i don't feel low

my brother bill
he work for the market
life is an arrow and now he's the target
dreamin for somethin
reachin for somethin
just waitin for the sun to carry me in

if you feel low
you can buy blow
from a payphone
i don't feel low
