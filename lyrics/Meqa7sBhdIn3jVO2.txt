I saw an eye in the sky
Our lady speaks of times to come
The secrets of the world revealed
Upon the shores of the end
Everything comes to life in me

My eyes have opened to the world

In this intimacy of the killing
Just reflections of outer limits
This is what I have become
I have the power to take life

In this intimacy of the killing
Just reflections of outer limits
This is what I have become
I have the power to take life

To take life!

(The) true face of my race!
Do I have the power to give life?
(The) true face of my race!

(The) true face of my race!
Do I have the power to give life?
(The) true face of my race!

True Face!
Silence the enemies of my Kingdom
True Face!
Silence the enemies of my Kingdom

Sweeping from the scarlet sky
Down to my dying eyes on earth
Bring back all my feverish beasts

Sweeping from the scarlet sky
Down to my dying eyes on earth

True face!
