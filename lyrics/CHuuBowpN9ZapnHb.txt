in the mornin light
put down the blinds
both hands in one glove
keep slippin around

slippin around
wasted and found
can't capture time
slippin around

I'm a burnin child
I burn inside
can I answer your love
let you be mine

for no reason I'll go
leave you behind
you won't be mine as I know
and I'll be running around

So I keep slippin around
wasted and found
can't capture time
slippin around

will we ever be again
will we ever be again
will we ever be again
will we ever be again

in the mornin light
put down the blinds
both hands in one glove
keep slippin around

slippin around
wasted and found
slippin around
can't capture time
slippin around
can't capture time
slippin around
can't capture time
