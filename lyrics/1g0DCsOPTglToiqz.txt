If I draw you upside down I can't let go
Leaves my mind at ease gives me something to focus on
Couldn't be alone
Couldn't be alone
If I speak in rounds for a while letting my tongue swell
I'll be sure to try and explain myself to dispel
Blame it on the day
Blame it on the day
Step dad just wants to learn how to be alone
Step dad just wants to learn how to be alone
Come get what's lost, what's left before it's gone
But what makes each step worth the time and regret still shows
In the cradle of my unruly chest you belong
Take it as it is
Make another bid
Step dad just wants to learn how to be alone
Step dad just wants to learn how to be alone
Step dad just wants to learn how to be alone
Come get what's lost, what's left before it's gone
