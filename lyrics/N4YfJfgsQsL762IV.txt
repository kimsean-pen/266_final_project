Eating from bins outside supermarkets
Kicked into the curb like empty coke cans
Become numb
Take nothing else for granted
Stay awake all the time
Never have a break
Never have a break

Dieu et mon droit
Dieu et mon droit
Your eyes have not seen
Your eyes have not seen
Dieu et mon droit
Dieu et mon droit
Your ears have not heard
Your ears have not heard

Scapegoated by the provincial losses
Trickling down like shit into the sewer
Serve yourself
Take pride
Work hard
Trust no one
Stay in [?] all the time
Never hesitate
Never hesitate

Dieu et mon droit
Dieu et mon droit
Your hands have not touched
Your hands have not touched
Dieu et mon droit
Dieu et mon droit
Your heart has not loved
Your heart has not loved
