Close my door––don't touch my stuff
And whats for dinner––that's not enough
And if you call me in the afternoon
I'm obliged to call you soon
But I wont call you I'm with my friends
You can see me once the day will end

My mommy wont let me eat breakfast in bed
She don't think I will clean, Ill just make a mess
To be completely fair I'm just a big mess

Buy me clothes and keep me warm
Ill never thank you––since I was born
And if you call me in the afternoon
Im obliged to call you soon
But I wont call you I'm with my friends
You can see me once the day will end

My mommy wont let me eat breakfast in bed
She don't think I will clean, Ill just make a mess
To be completely fair I'm just a big mess
