Once on this bitter Earth
You don't know what's bound to occur
I've been told "it's like that
Don't try to make it change"
But i can't stand steel
Up on my feet
Watching you rotting out
It's more that i can take

I follow the light
This might take some time

No need to take my hand
I can walk even like a man
I'm fed up with all that
Need to take a breath
Feeling possessed where is our freedom
Cause i won't let my soul be
Another standardized sheep

I follow the light
This might take some time
