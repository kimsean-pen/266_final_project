However you get in
That's how you leave again
But once you're in my head
I want to keep you there

And that's why
I lie awake every night
While I wait for your light to change
It seems so distant I can't see the end
Although my head is spinning like a ceiling fan
While I wait for your light to change

I might think this is it
Somehow we're on the brink
Just when I'm gonna quit
That's when the shit begins

And that's why
I lie awake every night
While I wait for your light to change
It seems so distant I can't see the end
Although my head is spinning like a ceiling fan
While I wait for your light to change

However you get in
You're always creeping in
And once you're in my head
I wanna keep you there

And that's why
I lie awake every night
While I wait for your light to change
It seems so distant I can't see the end
Although my head is spinning like a ceiling fan
While I wait for your light to change
