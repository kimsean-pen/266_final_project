I got a message
Pretend you'll guess what it said
Drive alone
Drive straight home

I did as instructed
Closed my door and locked it
Disappearing ink
but the words still sting

I sat and wrote a letter
I described the weather
and the scene
Remembering...

I forget tomorrow
For all the sickness and sorrow
Disappearing ink
but the words still sting

What was I thinking?
What was I thinking?
