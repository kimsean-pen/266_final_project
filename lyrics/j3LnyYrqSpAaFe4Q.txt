Come gather round people wherever you roam
Admit that the waters around you have grown
Accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times, they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
Keep your eyes open, the chance won't come again
And watch what you say for the wheel's still in spin
There's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times, they are a-changin'

Come senators, congressmen, please, heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he who gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
It'll rattle your windows and shake down your walls
For the times, they are a-changin'

Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'
Get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times, they are a-changin'
