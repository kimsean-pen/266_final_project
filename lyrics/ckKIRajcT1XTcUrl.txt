I started a joke
Which started the whole world crying
But I didn't see, oh no
That the joke was on me, oh no

I started to cry
Which started the whole world laughing
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me

I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said

'Till I finally died
Which started the whole world laughing
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me

I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said

'Till I finally died
Which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me, ohoho, no
That the joke was on me
Ohohoho, no no no
