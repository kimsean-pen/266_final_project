To live like common people, I never think I'll do
And so, my love, I give into this dark
Flowers in the day time and Lucifer at night
This woman said I'm torn between two lives

Visions of your lovers holding in some dreadful lights
Wishing they would never be apart
It's so hard, how can I hold on to someone I can't have
Obsessed with all the things that we could do

Take me on a night drive and take me home again
The quiet trip where we will meet the end
To live like common people, I never think I'll do
In defiance of a love never realized
