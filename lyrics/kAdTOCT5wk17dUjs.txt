I love you from the bottom of my pencil case
I love you in the songs, I write and sing
Love you because you put me in my rightful place

And I love the PRS cheques that you bring
Cheap, never cheap
I'll sing you songs till you're asleep

When you've gone upstairs I'll creep
And write it all down, down, down, down
Oh Shirley, oh Deborah, oh Julie, oh Jane
I wrote so many songs about you I forget your name

(I forget your name)
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
(I forget your name)
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
(I forget your name)
I love your from the bottom of my pencil case
I love the way you never ask me why

I love to write about each wrinkle on your face
And I love you till my fountain pen runs dry
Deep so deep the number one I hope to reap
Depends upon the tears you weep, so cry, lovely cry, cry, cry, cry

Oh Cathy, oh Alison, oh Phillipa, oh Sue
You made me so much money I wrote this song for you
(I wrote this song for you)
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too

(I wrote this song for you)
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
(For you)
Oh Cathy, oh Alison, oh Phillipa, oh Sue
You made me so much money I wrote this song for you
(I wrote this song for you)
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
(I wrote this song for you)
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
(For you, for you, for you, I wrote this song for you)
(I wrote this song for you)
