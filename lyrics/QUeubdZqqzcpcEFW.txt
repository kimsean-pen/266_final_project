Victimized by their lies
Where ignorance reigns from the fucking insane
Smash fear into your eyes
They're never guilty even when it's televised

Blue lies just to hunt
Blue lies for what it wants
Blue lies from the back of the car with his hand on his gun

Fuck your force
Fuck your laws
Your hands are the cause of it all
How do we trust when you intimidate?
And death by an officer is always the fate?
Fuck your insecurity
And your fraternal order of nobodies
Fuck your power and your strength
Stare into the eyes of someone who wont blink
Who won't blink

(Blue lies) fucked and corrupt
(Blue lies) fucked and corrupt
(Blue lies) fucked and corrupt
(Blue lies) fucked and corrupt

Preying on the innocent
Breeding up the prejudice
Cuffing on the innocent
Breeding up the prejudice

Who the fuck do you protect?
Our lives have no justice
Who the fuck do you protect?
Our lives have no justice
No justice whatsoever

No justice
No justice
Fuck this world
