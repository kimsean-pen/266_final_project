You said that I was all you'd ever want
You said that we were fine
You swore that you would never break my heart
You wasted all my time

These only lies, deep breath, my bad
I don't know where I'm bound

You swore that we would never be apart
You wanted this
Even though you said you wanna go
It's hard to say goodbye

It's so hard to leave and go, nowhere to hide
You know it's over
You know it's over
