A cigarette that bares a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
Still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumblin' words that told you what my heart meant
fairgrounds, painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

You came,
You saw,
You conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be

The winds of March that made my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings
But who's to answer
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you
