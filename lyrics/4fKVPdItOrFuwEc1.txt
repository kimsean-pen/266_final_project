We're lowering the standard in a process selective
The formula is too thin
But it takes more than one person
So everyone jump on
I'll miss you when you're just like them

Imitate and water down
Selection breathes on its own
Before the crash I'll write it out
Selection breathes on its own
Make them open the request line
Let selection kill the old
Take back the radio

I remember back then thinking
Easy comes but doesn't stay
What comes easy never stays
But the politics need means
And business never leaves
You better sing now while you can
Better sing now while you can

Imitate and water down
Selection breathes on its own
Till we crash I'll write it out
Selection breathes on its own
Make them open the request line
Let selection kill the old
Take back the radio

Sing now while you can, while you can
Sing now while you can, while you can

Imitate and water down
Selection breathes on its own
Till we crash I'll write it out
Selection breathes on its own
Make them open the request line
Let selection kill the old
Turn off the radio

But it takes more than one person
So everyone jump on
I'll miss you when you're just like them
