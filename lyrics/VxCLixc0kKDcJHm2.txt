Check it
So now the walls are closing in
One inch from the edge and you're ready to drop
You had your shot and you blew it
Quick sand, stuck in your brain, you're nothing but a slave
Don't waste my time I've got nothing to prove
I'll put you down this ain't your faction to rule
Stakes rise, i am counting the days before the endgame
And i will burn the fucking vile

These streets remain but it's wearing thin
So step back motherfucker because it's time for the truth
I hope one day it will sink in
So step back motherfucker because we are on the move

Yeah!
Betrayal, within the lies and delusion
Your split tongue speaks a devilish slang
Severed the ties and now you'll spend your days in bitter regret
Convicted, another nail in the coffin
Pure greed in your renegade act
You tried to test me, but you fell six feet deep
This is state of dominance
Yeah!

State of dominance!

Eyes locked on the stacks, and you took it
A lesson learned
Now living with eyes in the back of my head
This time I won't turn my back on you
I'll rip your fucking mask

Two faced disgrace
Eyes wide open but you're not awake

Yeah!
Betrayal, within the lies and delusion
Your split tongue speaks a devilish slang
Severed the ties and now you'll spend your days in bitter regret
Convicted, another nail in the coffin
Pure greed in your renegade act
You tried to test me, But you fell six feet deep
This is state of dominance!

This is state of dominance!

State of dominance!
State of dominance!
