In the mist
Of my endless search
The best in life
Becomes clear

The rest just begins
To fade by itself
That's a trick I learnt
Though it took so long

Bitter tears taste so sweet
I'm seeing my way
For the first time in years

When the love around
Begins to suffer
And you can't find love
In one
In one another
Push away those bitter tears
Bitter tears

And I thought I was
Doing no wrong
And I thought I was doing no wrong

In the hour
Of your needs
Lips are trembling
Cause you're gonna be free
Realise what we're doing here
The time is right to kill your fears

Bitter tears taste so sweet
I'm seeing my way
For the first time in years

When the love around
Begins to suffer
And you can't find love
In one
In one another
Push away those bitter tears
Bitter tears

And I thought I was doing no wrong

Push away those bitter tears

That's what they call doing no wrong
That's what they call doing no wrong

Push away those bitter tears
Push away those bitter tears
Push away those bitter tears

That's what they call doing no wrong
