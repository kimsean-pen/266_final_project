Sweet daisy chain
Around your neck
Through your hair
In the sun
Sweet glowing skin
Kiss the grass
Golden air fill your lungs

Slow down, let it all slow
Slow down, let it all slow

Sweet orange sky
Watch it fade
Colours mango and blue
Sweet glowing skin
Kiss the grass
And the light passes through

Slow down, let it all slow
Slow down, let it all slow
Slow down, let it all slow
Slow down, let it all

And our bones are growing stronger
Every day we breathe it in
We make time to see
And find our healing

Sweet daisy chain
Around your neck
Through your hair
In the sun

Slow down let it all slow,
Slow down let it all
