In the cold, the wait, you come, you gave me
In the way that you come and make it alright
I was here in the world, it's the world that you gave me
Every time

You can say that you're running
'Cause I can go back on the street
Why be here when we're both gonna fake it anyway?

No more try to hear killing your goal
Means I can be bigger than the tones
In the moments of suffering

Like the feeling that you gave me
Like a snowflake through the fire, babe
I'll be frozen in time, but you'll be here
Suffering

Will you be here suffering?
Will you be here suffering?
Well, I hope to be
