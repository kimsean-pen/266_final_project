In the Villa of Ormen
In the Villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle
At the centre of it all
At the centre of it all
Your eyes

On the day of execution
On the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile

At the centre of it all
At the centre of it all
Your eyes
Your eyes

In the Villa of Ormen
In the Villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle
At the centre of it all
At the centre of it all
Your eyes
Your eyes

Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
I'm a Blackstar
I'm a Blackstar

How many times does an angel fall?
How many people lie instead of talking tall?
He trod on sacred ground
He cried loud into the crowd
I'm a Blackstar
I'm a Blackstar
I'm not a gangster

I can't answer why
I'm a Blackstar
Just go with me
I'm not a filmstar
I'm-a take you home
I'm a Blackstar
Take your passport and shoes
I'm not a popstar
And your sedatives, boo
I'm a Blackstar
You're a flash in the pan
I'm not a marvel star
I'm the great I am
I'm a blackstar

I'm a blackstar, way up, oh honey, I've got game
I see right so white, so open-heart it's pain
I want eagles in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes
I'm a Blackstar
I'm a Blackstar

Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
I'm a Blackstar
I'm a star star
I'm a Blackstar

I can't answer why
I'm not a gangster
But I can tell you how
I'm not a flam star
We were born upside-down
I'm a star star
Born the wrong way 'round
I'm not a white star
I'm a Blackstar
I'm not a gangster
I'm a Blackstar
I'm a Blackstar
I'm not a pornstar
I'm not a wandering star
I'm a Blackstar
I'm a Blackstar

In the Villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle
At the centre of it all
Your eyes

On the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile
At the centre of it all
Your eyes
Your eyes
