I will not leave a letter nothing at all
I'm sure you won't notice that I'm even gone
I wont break this silence we've shared for so long
I will be strong

I will not leave a letter nothing at all
I'm sure you won't notice that I'm even gone
Why did I stay here stay for so long
When we're so far gone
I feel so stupid taking this fall
I should have seen it known all along
I won't break this silence we've shared for so long
I will be strong

What could you possibly want from me
Can't you see I'm already gone
Everything we thought we'd be
I still don't feel sorry for this loss

I will not waste a moment thinking these thoughts
Forgetting comes easy
I never cared at all
Hurt became hate now I'm feeling the strain
There's just too much pain
Falling to pieces get swept away
Left all our pictures some to fade
I won't break this silence we've shared for so long
I will be strong

What could you possibly want from me
Can't you see I'm already gone
Everything we thought we'd be
I still don't feel sorry for this loss

You don't have to say anything at all
I wont stop you from walking away
I'll do nothing at all

Sitting here I waste a day,
While the memories fade away,
You know I expected so much more from you
