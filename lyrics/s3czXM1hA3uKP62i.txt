Release me from your wire
Dagger moon
Release me from your wire
Dagger moon
Release me from your wire
I'm the hang of your desire
Always on the outside
Dagger moon
Tell me what you came for
Dagger moon
Tell me what you came for
Dagger moon
You came in with your needle
Deep inside my fevers
God above you
Dagger moon

Shadows are fading
Dagger moon
Shattered beneath my patient attitude
Nervous sooner changes
I hate you
Always on the outside
Dagger moon

Always on the outside
Dagger moon
Always on the outside
Dagger moon
Always on the outside
Dagger moon
