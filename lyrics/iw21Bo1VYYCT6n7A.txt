What if...
What if we run away?
What if...
What if we left today?
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?
What if...
What if we're hard to find?
What if...
What if we lost our minds?
What if we left them fall behind
And they're never found?

And when the lights start flashing like a photo booth
And the stars exploding
We'll be fireproof

My youth
My youth is yours
Tripping on skies, sipping waterfalls
My youth
My youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth
My youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

What if...?
What if we start to drive?
What if...?
What if we close our eyes?
What if...?
Speeding through red lights into paradise
Because we've no time for getting old
Mortal body, timeless souls
Cross your fingers, here we go

And when the lights start flashing like a photo booth
And the stars exploding
We'll be fireproof

My youth
My youth is yours
Tripping on skies, sipping waterfalls
My youth
My youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth
My youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

My youth
My youth is yours
Tripping on skies, sipping waterfalls
My youth
My youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth
My youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

My youth is yours

My youth
My youth is yours
Tripping on skies, sipping waterfalls
My youth
My youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth
My youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

My youth is yours

My youth is yours
