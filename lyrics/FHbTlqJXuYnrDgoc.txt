I wish I meant something to you
Like you did to me
I wish I could stay as new
As when you first saw me

Oh my
Head is tight from just try to hide my views
Oh when
I keep trying my best just to keep you

Kiss me in the corner
(You're such a heart)
So that you remember
(Baby when I'm gone)

While we're still having fun
Well I'm still waiting
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)
Baby when I am gone
You were something
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)

I'm not as smart as your books
But I know how to look
Out for you
I come with the head and the heart
Being using it from the start

And my
Brain is starting to suffering bcos of you
Still
I've been trying my best just to please you

Kiss me in the corner
(You're such a heart)
So that you remember
(Baby when I'm gone)

While we're still having fun
Well I'm still waiting
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)(Waiting for the mountains to fall)
Baby when I am gone
You were something
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)(Waiting for the mountains to fall)

Kiss me in the corner
(You're such a heart)
So that you remember
(Baby when I'm gone)

While we're still having fun
Well I'm still waiting
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)
Baby when I am gone
You were something
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)
