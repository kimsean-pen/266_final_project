I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality

You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality

Why don't you put me first for once
And spare me the bad news?
(Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down
(Oh no)
Because I'm not going anywhere

You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality

Why don't you put me first for once
And spare me the bad news?
(Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down
(Oh no)
'Cause I'm not going anywhere

I'm all alone
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say
There's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
(I'm all alone)
I feel sorry for you
It's hard to say
(It's hard to say)
There's nothing I can do

(There's nothing I can do)

Why don't you put me first for once
And spare me the bad news?
(Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down
(Oh no)
'Cause I'm not going anywhere
I'm not going anywhere
