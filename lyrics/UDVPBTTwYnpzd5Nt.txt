July 13, 1946

Dear General MacArthur,

With your permission
I offer wishes of good health
During this heat
That burns anything

The words I slowly put together
Do not flow easily, they only fill my heart

Recently, fulfilling
Your heart's desire
You removed the whaling
Moratorium.
Your gesture brings
A much needed food
To our community
And families

The words I slowly put together
Do not flow easily, they only fill my heart

A million year old fossil
I send to you
This comes from my family
And the ancient sea
A prehistoric impression
Of the modern krill
She feeds the noble whale
And offers you longevity

The words I slowly put together
Do not flow easily, they only fill my heart

Finally, please take good care in the heat.

Sincerely yours,
Shizuka
