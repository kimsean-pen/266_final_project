she's worried she said too much
and talking i'm talking she's talking like books i read
it's easy it's easy it's easy to shut yourself off
never on the record it'll never show up

feel safe, inside, inside those well drawn line
boyfriend, a car, a job, my white girl life
she swallowed a spider to catch, to catch that fly
but i don't know why, why she swallowed that lie

she wants to be anonymous
i sign anonymous
she wants to be like everybody else
i sign anonymous

not enough for you to know
not enough for you to own

these words are all i have
these word are who i am
