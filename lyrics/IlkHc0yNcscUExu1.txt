Fear is a token
And, in this darkness
It never rests
My body is barren
A horse for a hero
The sun fails to burn
Hail! The White Grain
This life, this pain

His ship never sails
And my nights never end
His heart never falls
But, my tears never bleed
His lips never lie
My eyes never pray
His faith never falters
My doubt never stays
His love never slaughters
My tongue never needs
My hope and it's Angels
Our death and our deeds
My hope and it's Angels
Our death and our deeds...
