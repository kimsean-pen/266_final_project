You're not undercover
You're just connected to the shame of your secret lover
It never works out in the end
if it keeps on going you might lose your only friend
It's all connected, baby, it's all connected to our brains
Think a little harder when you're feeling all alone

"For heaven's sake!" I have been screaming at you all time
It makes no sense how he treats you, how could you miss the sign,
He's been cheating on you, messing with your head,
I only say it 'cause I care

Maybe I dream about you
Maybe I'm too afraid to say - I think about you every second of the day
He's a hypocrite and he should be locked up in a cage
It's all connected baby, it's all connected to our brains
Think a little harder when you're feeling all alone

"For heaven's sake!" I have been screaming at you all time
It makes no sense how he treats you, how could you miss the sign,
He's been cheating on you, messing with your head,
I only say it 'cause I care

Ooh
I only say it 'cause I care

"For heaven's sake!" I have been screaming at you all time
It makes no sense how he treats you, how could you miss the sign,
He's been cheating on you, messing with your head,
I only say it 'cause I care

"For heaven's sake!" I have been screaming at you all time
It makes no sense how he treats you, how could you miss the sign,
He's been cheating on you, messing with your head,
I only say it 'cause I care
Say it 'cause I care
