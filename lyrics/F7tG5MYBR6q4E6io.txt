Oh, these silly games
Oh, these silly games
That they wanna play with you

People on the street intimidate you
Though they see you cryin', they all smile
Days go by but nothin' ever changes
Was it ever worth it all the while
She's still a child
And so she must be free

Oh, these silly games
Oh, these silly games
That they wanna play with you

People on the street intimidate you
Though they see you cryin', they all smile
Days go by but nothin' ever changes
Was it ever worth it all the while
She's still a child
And so she must be free

Oh these silly games
That they wanna play with you
