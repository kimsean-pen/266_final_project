Walking sadly through the park
I hear crying in the darkness
And thought I act like I cannot hear
Their situation is very clear
A girl who's trying to tell her guy
The time has come that they say good-bye
And his answer tears my heart apart:

Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you

Walking with you through the park
Now it's my voice in the darkness
Just like the girl trying to tell her guy
I'm telling you we must say good-bye
I can't believe when I hear once more
The very words that were said before
Come from deep within your broken heart:

(His voice echoes in the dark
His voice echoes in the dark)

Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you

I'll give you one night

Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you

I'll get you one more night

Give me tonight
Give me tonight
Give me tonight...

His voice echoes in the darkness

[4x]
Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you
