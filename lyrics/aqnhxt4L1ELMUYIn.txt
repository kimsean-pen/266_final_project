There's a likely chance, that if you're a girl I've met
I've imagined a life with you
I know that probably sounds obsessive
But that's just what I do

I am desperate, like a praying atheist
I need love I need affection and I hate myself for this

Get over yourself I say under my breath
When I get annoyed by the thoughts in my head
I don't deserve to say I'm sad I don't know what sadness is
I'm nothing more than complaints from a dumb spoilt kid

I crave love
I crave attention
And I hate myself for this

I'm embarrassed by my depression
When I put things in perspective
