Easy was it ever I don't know
But I've changed my mind a thousand times before
So don't you place your bets on me cause I can change
And you may see
That I'm just one of them.

I'm never gonna turn around
don't want to see I'm not a left behind
a million secrets safetly hidden deep inside my mind

Lazy as it seems
It's things I like to keep
people never learn from their mistakes

So don't you put your trust in me
cause I can change
and you may see
that I'm just one of them

I'm never gonna turn around
don't want to see I'm not a left beind
a million secrets safetly hidden deep inside my mind

inside my mind.

flashbacks

oh, I know what
I was doing
what a feeling

flashbacks

oh, I know what
I was doing
what a feeling

I'm never gonna turn around
don't want to see I'm not a left behind
a million secrets safetly hidden deep inside my mind

I'm never gonna turn around
don't want to see all that I've done
a million secrets safetly hidden deep inside my mind
