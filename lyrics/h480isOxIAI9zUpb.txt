Drowning in you. Askin' nothin', takin'.
Do you believe in passion and romance?
Destined to be within us and around us?

Diana, she loves me
No innocence or compromise
Diana, she loves me
The only way she knows

When the soul's in flight, you set your body free
And all of your lighted lessons, in all it's fantasies
And as a shiver reverts the tension
From an materialized dementia

The make belief, our liberty
You offer some love, swifts and chains
Never change you for all the dames
I stand for you, you open up the me
She said she wanted both of us to go
And she won't give up for nothing

Diana, she loves me
No innocence or compromise
Diana, she loves me
The only way she knows

Diana, she loves me
No innocence or compromise
Diana, she loves me
The only way she knows
