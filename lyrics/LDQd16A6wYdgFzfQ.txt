You know I don't wanna know, don't wanna know about that love thing.

Give me what I'm needing, You know what I'm dreaming of
Don't wanna know about that love thing.

Been broken hearted before but that's the last time it happens to me
I keep on giving still you're asking for more
Too much emotion baby why can't you see

I'm not afraid of your love
why can't you see I've had my share of that

#
You gotta want more
You know you got it boy
You gotta want me
It's just like me
I'm not that easy as a matter of fact

There's no room for lovin' stop that push and shovin' yeah,
Don't wanna know about that love thing.
Give me what I'm needing you know what I'm dreaming of,
Don't wanna know about that love thing.

(Here we go, Here we go, Here we go)

Now don't go wasting my time no(wasting my time)
You're not the only thing I've got on my mind
My friends are with me when you ain't been around
Your precious words and promises ain't bringing me down

I've got some living to do(i got some living to do)
But don't assume I'm gonna be with you

#
You gotta want more
You know you got it boy
You gotta want me
It's just like me
I'm not that easy as a matter of fact

There's no room for lovin' stop that push and shovin' yeah,
Don't wanna know about that love thing.
Give me what I'm needing you know what I'm dreaming of,
Don't wanna know about that love thing.

Stop pushing
You're rushing
You're losing my lovin'
I hope it
I see it
Just play it
You feel it
Gotta be bold, bold and oh so strong,
Get with this and you got it goin' on.
On and on with the girls named Spice.
You wanna get with us then you'd better think twice,
God help the mister, yeah God help the mister,
That comes between me and my sistas!

I'm not afraid of your love(I'm not afraid of your love)
why can't you see I've had my share of that,
