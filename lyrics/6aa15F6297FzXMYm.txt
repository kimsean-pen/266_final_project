If we were doomed from the start
Why did this even begin?
In truth all I wanted was to take off this skin
Is this a game we were destined to lose?
The sky is always darker when you're born through a noose
Like me
And you were never like me

And I'm just wasting away
No life for me
And if you cut me open
You'll see what's running through my veins

The essence of beauty is defined through hate
You need to know the truth
You can't deny the truth (like me)
And you were never like me
And you will never be like me

And I'm just wasting away
No life for me
And if you cut me open
You'll see what's running through my veins

You wanna know what it feels like
You wanna know what it feels like

Medication and therapy
Medication and therapy

Crawling through the mud
On your hands and knees

Crawling through the mud
You are dead to me
Give me ecstasy
Medication and therapy

You were everything to me
Medication and therapy
You were everything to me
Medication and therapy
