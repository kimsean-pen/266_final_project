Fire with fire
Fire with fire

You had to open up that door
It's never gonna be the way it was before
So what do we fight for?
And do we always have to even up that score?

I don't know where we went wrong
I don't know where we belong
Tell me why we are so lost?
Will we decide which side we're on?

And now it's on, we're fighting
Fire with fire
The flames are burning, burning
Higher and higher

It always has to be an
Eye for an eye
Justice remains the one
And only desire
Fighting fire with fire

You do to me like I do to you
And I do to you like you do to me
Fighting fire with fire
Fighting fire with fire

There's a feeling deep inside
It's way to hard to ever push aside
It's all that's on your mind
I wanna give in but I can't this time

I don't know where we went wrong
I don't know where we belong
Tell me why we are so lost?
Will we decide which side we're on?

And now it's on, we're fighting
Fire with fire
The flames are burning, burning
Higher and higher

It always has to be an
Eye for an eye
Justice remains the one
And only desire
Fighting fire with fire

You do to me like I do to you
And I do to you like you do to me
Fighting fire with fire
Fighting fire with fire

You aren't backing down, backing down
And I ain't giving into you
There's no more common ground, common ground
You broke the only golden rule

Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire

And now it's on, we're fighting
Fire with fire
The flames are burning, burning
Higher and higher

It always has to be an
Eye for an eye
Justice remains the one
And only desire
Fighting fire with fire

You do to me like I do to you
And I do to you like you do to me
Fighting fire with fire
Fighting fire with fire

You do to me like I do to you
And I do to you like you do to me
Fighting fire with fire
Fighting fire with fire
Fire with fire
