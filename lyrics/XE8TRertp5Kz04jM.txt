We followed signs and artificial lines
For a tinted sky where the sun always shines
We're palm tree tall, close my eyes and I won't fall
My hands trim the air but my feet can't feel the floor

We carry on through a wasteland
We drive on, drive on
We leave it all by the wayside
We drive on, drive on

You're so close to me
But it won't mean anything
If it feels like heaven but it looks like hell
I can close my eyes to see
Doesn't mean that much to me
'Cause it feels like heaven but it looks like hell

Pulled apart the city without a heart
How I mourned our loss with my fingers crossed
The sad delight, we don't smile but we never fight
How we learned to ignore what we needed to know

And leave it all by the wayside
And drive on, drive on

You're so close to me
But it won't mean anything
If it feels like heaven but it looks like hell
I can close my eyes to see
That it won't mean much to me
'Cause it feels like heaven but it looks like hell

We carry on through a wasteland
We drive on, drive on
We leave it all by the wayside
We drive on, drive on

But it won't mean anything
If it feels like heaven but it looks like hell
I can close my eyes to see
Doesn't mean that much to me
'Cause it feels like heaven but it looks like hell

Oh,
You know
Oh
We carry on through a wasteland
We drive on, drive on
We leave it all by the wayside
And drive

You're so close to me
But it won't mean anything
If it feels like heaven but it looks like hell
I can close my eyes to see
Doesn't mean that much to me
'Cause it feels like heaven but it looks like hell
