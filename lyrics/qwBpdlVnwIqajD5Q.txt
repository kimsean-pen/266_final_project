Oh, I could feel the changes comin'
Felt it in the breeze
Oh, I could feel the changes comin'
Comin' right for me
Oh, I could feel the changes comin'
Saw it on TV
Oh, I could feel the changes comin'
Saw it starin' right on back at me

Oh, I could feel the shadow comin'
Straight on down the line
Masquerading like he was a friend of mine
Oh, I could feel the darkness
Wrap in all its arms, in mine
Oh, I could feel the world was
Turnin' all inside my mind
Oh, I could feel the world was
Turnin' all inside, all inside my mind

I knew it when it started
Felt the shift right as it parted
So my feet cried down below me
Saw the whole room move around me
Saw my old life and my old friends
Saw the haunted, call me back again

Oh, maybe there's a past life comin'
Out inside of me
Maybe it's the song I'm singin'
Maybe everything's just turnin'
On how it should be
Maybe there's a past life comin'
Out inside of me
Oh, maybe there's a past life comin'
Out inside, inside of me
