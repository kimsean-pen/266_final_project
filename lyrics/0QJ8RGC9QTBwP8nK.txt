End's coming near
Still repulsive, but do you care
Burned senses, feeling none
My invaders, I see them moving on
You are my enemy
This body's struggling, don't you see?
Fuck you and me
Welcome to reality

Your focus shifts away
Emotionless in catalepsy
We're drowning every day
We fight back, we fight back
Your focus shifts away
Emotionless in catalepsy
We're drowning every day
We fight back, we fight back

My vision's clear
Comprehensive and full of fear
Fuck you and me
Welcome to reality

Your focus shifts away
Emotionless in catalepsy
We're drowning every day
We fight back, we fight back
Your focus shifts away
Emotionless in catalepsy
We're drowning every day
We fight back, we fight back

Limbs out of control
Heavy shivers, dying soul
Massive loss of blood
Tortured to the last spot

Your focus shifts away
Emotionless in catalepsy
We're drowning every day
We fight back, we fight back
Your focus shifts away
Emotionless in catalepsy
We're drowning every day
We fight back, we fight back
