Einar
This blue eyed pop
It's just fabulous to go twisting,

Björk
Twisting.

Einar
Boogieing, in beat with

Björk
Beat with

Einar
the thousand pound

Einar and Björk
Snare sound.

Einar
After boogieing
We all crave for a hot-dog spashed with noise (noise),
Queue and spew then back home to our love nest,
Need I say more.
Oh! This blue eyed pop is just pure ecstasy.

Björk
This is too much fun, fun, fun,
Everyone is so close to laughing,
This kind of joy won't last,

Björk
Something wonderful is about to happen.
I feel perfectly ready don't know yet what it is,
I will look here inside this disco, this is so hot hot,
We melt together like tigers and we are dancing together.
