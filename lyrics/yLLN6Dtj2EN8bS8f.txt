Too much, too much is never enough
I had you and I gave you up
No idea where my mind was for months
I woke up, I cashed in all of my luck
Walked hand and hand with your trust
And everybody was kissing on fire
And we all got burnt

It'd be safer to hate her
Than to love her and to lose her
It'd be safer to hate her all around

Caught you having a laugh
Did you catch me have the last?
I've been smiling like this for days
Just to make up for my mistakes
In the dark, I watch everyone disappear
And I am beginning to let myself down
I am pushing everyone that was in, out

It'd be safer to hate her
Than to love her and to lose her
It'd be safer to hate her all around

And nobody knows what it's like
To live and die on the inside
Nobody knows what it's like
To be one of a kind

When we die, do we feel alive?
When we die, do we feel alive?

It'd be safer to hate her
Than to love her and to lose her
It'd be safer to hate her all around

And nobody knows what it's like
To live and die on the inside
And nobody knows
