Waterfall
nothing can harm me at all
my worries seem so very small
with my waterfall
I can see my rainbow calling me yeah
through the misty breeze of my waterfall
Some people say day-dreaming is
for the all the lazy minded fools with nothing else to do
So let them laugh laugh at me
so just as long as i have you to see me through
i have nothing to lose long as i have you
Waterfall
don't ever change your ways
fall with we for a million days
oh my waterfall
