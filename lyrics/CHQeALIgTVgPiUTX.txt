Don't belive what you see
Belive in me and my reality
I am a man of God
God can't you hear that I'm begging you?
Don't belive what you hear
Believe in me and I will reappear
Salvation here at last
At last someone to answer all my prayers
Hope is a desert running dry
Deep inside
You refuse to face the facts but pray for life
Find salvation in distress
We will wait for the day
You'll break out and re-awake
(Lies!)
Don't belive what you see
Belive in me and my reality
Eternity indeed
Indeed i'ts the end all and be all there's
Hope is a desert running dry
Deep inside
You refuse to face the facts but pray for life
Find salvation in distress
We will wait for the day
You'll break out and re-awake
(Lies!)
Domine Jesu, demitte nobis debita nostra,
Salva nos ab igne inferiori,
Perduc in caelum omnes animas
Praesertim eas, quae misericordiae tuae
Maxime indigent.
In nomine Patris,
Et Filii,
Et Spiritus Sancti.
Amen
Living a lie
Human power will devour
Our senses bring us to forget
Human sources will not save
The power of faith heals us all
Hope is a desert running dry
Deep inside
You refuse to face the facts but pray for life
Find salvation in distress
We will wait for the day
You'll break out and re-awake
And we wait for the day
To discover there's no way
I can't wait at this rate
It's too little and too late
To live this lie
Living a lie
----The text in Latin translated in English----
"Lord Jesus, forgive us our trespasses,
Save us from the fires below,
Lead all souls into heaven,
Especially those that need your mercy most
In the name of the Father,
And the Son,
And the Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghost).
Amen"
