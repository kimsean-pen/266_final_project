Shoplifter, you'll never learn
When you commit the crime
Shoplifter, you're getting burned
And now you gotta do the time

It's a 1, 2, 3 on the felony
Well not everything is free
Now that you served the community
It's the life of a petty thief

It's not considered stealing
Unless you're getting caught
But you'll be caught stealing
Tryin' to take something you haven't got

Shoplifter, you'll never learn
What lies behind your back
Not a burglar or a bankrobber
Just a kleptomaniac

STOP! ATTENTION!
It's not considered stealing
Unless you're getting caught
But you'll be caught stealing

Tryin' to take something you haven't got
Shoplifter, you'll never learn
When you commit the crime
Shoplifter, you're getting burned
And now you gotta do the time
Oh now you gotta do the time
Well now you gotta do some time
