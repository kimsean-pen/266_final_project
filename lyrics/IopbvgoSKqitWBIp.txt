Fails, keep on changing
I keep on running
I'll never let you down
I hear the sound
Sunrise always comes around
Sunrise always comes around
Fails, keep on changing
I keep on running
I'll never let you down
I hear the sound
Sunrise always comes around
Sunrise always comes around
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
(Instrumental)
Fails, keep on changing
I keep on running
I'll never let you down
I use sound
Sunrise always comes around
Sunrise always comes around
Fails, keep on changing
I keep on running
I'll never let you down
I hear the sound
Sunrise always comes around
Sunrise always comes around
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
(Ooh, oooh, ooh... ooooh!)
(Ooh, oooh, ooh... oooh)
