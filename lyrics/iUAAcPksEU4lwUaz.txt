One summer night
I will call you in
Summer night
You will fall in love
Now that you're gone
I can't go living every night
When I ask you to be (???)

One summer night
I will break your love
Summer night
I will miss your love
Now that you're gone
I can't go living every night
When i ask you (???) forever ever more

Fantasies and fallacies
Are fairy tales and lies
Time is running out
Yeah
Better write these lines

One summer night
I will call you in
Summer night
You will fall in love
Now that you're gone
I can't go living every night
When I ask you to be (???)

Fantasies and fallacies
Are fairy tales and lies
Time is running out
Yeah
Better write these lines
Happy days of childlike bliss
Of innocence and lies
Time is running out
Yeah
Better write down these lines
