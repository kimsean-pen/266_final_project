Ooh

I'm not your average type of girl
I'm gonna show the world
The strength in me
That sometimes they can't see
I'm about to switch my style
And soon things may get wild
But I'll prove that
I can conquer anything

So from my head to toe
I'm taking full control
I'll make it on my own
This time

(Better watch me shine)

Better watch out
Going for the knockout
And I won't stop
Till I'm on top now
Not gonna give up
Until I get what's mine
Better check that
I'm about to upset
And I'm hot now
So you better step back
I'm taking over
So watch me shine

(Watch me)

So get ready here I come
Until the job is done
No time to waste
There's nothing stopping me
Oh
But you don't hear me though
So now it's time to show
I'll prove I'm gonna be
The best I can be

So from my head to toe
My mind body and soul
I'm taking full control
This time

(So watch me shine)

Better watch out
Going for the knockout
And I won't stop
Till I'm on top now
Not gonna give up
Until I get what's mine
Better check that
I'm about to upset
And I'm hot now
So you better step back
I'm taking over
So watch me shine

(watch me shine)

Bet you don't think
I can take it
But my mind and body are strong
Bet you don't think I can make it
It won't take long
Bet you don't think I can take it
But my mind and body are strong
Bet you don't think I can make it
It won't take long

Now watch me shine

Better watch out
Going for the knockout
And I won't stop
Till I'm on top now
Not gonna give up
Until I get what's mine
Better check that
I'm about to upset
And I'm hot now
So you better step back
I'm taking over
So watch me shine

Now watch me shine

Better watch out
Going for the knockout
And I won't stop
Till I'm on top now
Not gonna give up
Until I get what's mine

(Until I get what's mine)

Better check that
I'm about to upset
And I'm hot now
So you better step back
I'm taking over
So watch me shine
Watch me
Watch me shine
Watch me
