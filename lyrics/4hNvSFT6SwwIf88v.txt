once i was alive, it took me by surprise
then i realized i was paralyzed

summer's freezing me
i was told to stay awake until i found my saving grace in you
summer's freezing me
in the light i tried to hide from the cold that i gave to you
summer's freezing me
now i'm gone, so nothing's lost and we can wait till summer freezes you

once i was alive, it took me by surprise
then i realized i was paralyzed

summer's freezing here
please come back next year
summer's freezing here
please come back next year
