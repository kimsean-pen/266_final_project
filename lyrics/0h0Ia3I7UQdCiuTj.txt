Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face
Don't mind people grinnin' in your face
You just bear this in mind, a true friend is hard to find
Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face

You know your mother would talk about you
Your own sisters and your brothers too
They just don't care how you're tryin' to live
They'll talk about you still

Yes, but bear, ooh, this in mind, a true friend is hard to find
Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face
Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face
Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face

Oh, just bear, ooh this in mind, a true friend is hard to find
Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face

You know they'll jump you up and down
They'll carry you all 'round and 'round
Just as soon as your back is turned
They'll be tryin' to crush you down

Yes, but bear this in mind, a true friend is hard to find
Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face
Don't mind people grinnin' in your face
Don't mind people grinnin' in your face, oh, Lord

And just bear this in mind, a true friend is hard to find
Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face
