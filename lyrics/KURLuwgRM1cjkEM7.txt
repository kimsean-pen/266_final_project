It walks with me
Doesn't think I know

When I conjure it
As I look around

And I look around
You can tell
That no counts will miss you

And I cast her flow
As it walks me home

She'll comfort me
Does she even know

As I send along
That I'm not alone

That I'm not alone
And she tends to be

She can tell no wrong
She can speak no wrong

We have angelic weirdness
