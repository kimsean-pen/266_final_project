Searchin' and seekin'
never sleepin'
I've got to find me a man.
I want no disguises
just surprises someone who I'll understand.
I don't need a guy who spends only one night

then tell me he's got no more time.
I'm looking for someone to share my life
I better move on down the line.

Searchin' - looking for love all the time I can.
Searchin' - looking for love I've got to find a man.
Some guys excite me but don't invite me.
They don't even notice

It seems
oh
I'm always waiting
anticipating.
I long for the man of my dreams.
He needn't be handsome

have fortune or fame

He just gotta be sweet and kind

But there's so many wanting or needing the same

I: gotta move on down the line.
Searchin' - looking for love all the time I can. . . .
Searchin' - looking for love all the time I can. . . .
Will I ever reach my goal
will I ever get the chance
To live my life with just one man?
I thought by now I held the love I always wanted

But things are not the way I planned.
O
I'm searchin' - looking for love all the time I can.
Searchin' - looking for love
Iire got to find me a man.
Searchin' - looking for love every place I can.
Searchin' - looking for love
I'ce got to find a man.
