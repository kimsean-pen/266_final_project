After too many dimensions
arriving to the last one
A road covered with the dying
Shadows masticating them

Walking ahead
Torture spreading on the way
Dismembered human beings
Flying souls fading away

You find no escape
Walking just around and around
Flying shadows slaying and torturing
Will they also rip your soul away...?
