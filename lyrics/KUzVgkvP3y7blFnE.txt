Oh how much, oh how much
For the puppy in the window?
I can see him being so alone
I believe he sees a friend in me
Oh how much, oh how much
For the puppy in the window?
How I love his little pink nose
I think he's waiting to come home with me

Found my best friend
At the old dog pound
The old dog pound
The old dog pound
Found my best friend
At the old dog pound
The old dog pound
The old dog pound

Puppies are forever, not just for Christmas
Puppies are forever, not just for Christmas
Puppies are forever, not just for Christmas
Puppies are forever, not just for Christmas
Cause they're so cute and fluffy with shiny coats
But will you love 'em when they're old and slow?
Puppies are forever, not just for Christmas
Puppies are forever, puppies are forever, oh

Oh, oh my sweet, oh my sweet
Little puppy from the window
I will never let you go
'Cause now you're my family
Oh my cute, oh my cute
Little puppy from the window
I've been waiting for you so long
I'll never let you down, baby

Found my best friend
At the old dog pound
The old dog pound
The old dog pound

Puppies are forever, not just for Christmas
Puppies are forever, not just for Christmas
Puppies are forever, not just for Christmas
Puppies are forever, not just for Christmas
Cause they're so cute and fluffy with shiny coats
But will you love 'em when they're old and slow?
Puppies are forever, not just for Christmas
Puppies are forever, puppies are forever
Oh, oh
Found my best friend
At the old dog pound
The old dog pound
The old dog pound

Puppies are forever, not just for Christmas
Puppies are forever, not just for Christmas
Puppies are forever, not just for Christmas
Puppies are forever, puppies are forever
Puppies are forever
