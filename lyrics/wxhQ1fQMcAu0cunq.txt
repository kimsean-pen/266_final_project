You're like all of your New York City friends
Although it's made up, windows of doors I'm in
But you're true too, true to your old town, old town friends
And we'll wait 'round here until that day comes when

You need somewhere to run run run
Somewhere to run run run
Somewhere to run run run
Somewhere to run

Late at night, the night as it always darkens up
And there's static clinnin' under your dancing shoes
But you're right too right to keep chasing those crazies off
But you never asked for it but I know you know I do

I know somewhere to run run run
Somewhere to run run run
Somewhere to run run run
Somewhere to run

I know somewhere to run run run
Somewhere to run run run
Somewhere to run run run
Somewhere to run

Their labels are focused through it through a spell
And wow-ing in everything
I'm right guided, that there in the stars is like all that you've been through

Too, true to your old town, old town friends
Now you stay true, true to your old town, old town friends
And we'll wait 'round here until that day comes when

You need somewhere to run run run
Somewhere to run run run
Somewhere to run run run
Somewhere to run

You need somewhere to run run run
Somewhere to run run run
Somewhere to run run run
Somewhere to run

Somewhere to run
Somewhere.
Somewhere.
Somewhere to run
Somewhere to run
