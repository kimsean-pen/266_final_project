Here comes the doctors shed the sunlight out
I feel the ground
And I keep the world away
To be asleep throughout the day is all I want

I see we've come for wasted time
My feet are strong, my head was not
I feel a call, I'm on the dial

And I keep the world away
To be asleep throughout the day is all I need
Tell me, was it enough when we were first in love
To grab the seed and just leave

I see we've come through wasted time
My feet are strong, my head was not
I feel the call
I'm on the ground to find it
