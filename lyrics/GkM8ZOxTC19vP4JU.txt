Suburban dogs get afraid when it rains
Suburban dogs bark at slow moving trains
They'll run from your house and come back the same day
Suburban dogs are in love with their chains
Carry me back to sweet Jersey, back where I long to be
By the fumes of the yellow and green, next to my darling lady
Under the spell of a buzzing street light
I walked alone through the humid black night
The water was cold from the sprinkler down the road
So I walked on through, I was feeling alright
Suburban dogs get afraid when it rains
Suburban dogs bark at slow moving trains
They'll run from your house and come back the same day
Suburban dogs are in love with their chains
Carry me back to sweet Jersey, back where I long to be
By the fields of the yellow and green, next to my darling lady
Back home
Back home
Back home
Back home
