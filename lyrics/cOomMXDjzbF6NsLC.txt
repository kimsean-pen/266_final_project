Adrenaline and menthol
Grinding at my teeth
I'm singing
Show me what I wanna see
I'm saying
Show me where I wanna be
Homesick? No
I'm sick of home
All it ever gave me
Were weekends on the phone
Feeling
Badly, but laughing
At the times that I passed up
Guess that wasn't enough, guess that wasn't enough
Homesick? No
I'm sick of home
All it ever gave me
Were weekends on the phone
Feeling
Badly, but laughing
At the times that I passed up
Guess I wasn't enough, GUESS I WASN'T ENOUGH!
HEY! (HEY!)
HEY! (HEY!)
Kid c'mon tell me what you're missing
Tell me what you're missing out on
HEY! (HEY!)
HEY! (HEY!)
Kid c'mon tell me what you're looking
Tell me what you're looking down on
Tell me what you're looking down on
Homesick? No
I'm sick of home
All it ever gave me
Were weekends on the phone
Feeling
Badly, but laughing
At the times that I passed up
Guess that wasn't enough, guess that wasn't enough
Homesick? No
I'm sick of home
All it ever gave me
Were weekends on the phone
Feeling
Badly, but laughing
At the times that I passed up
Guess that wasn't enough, guess that wasn't enough
ONE!
TWO!
THREE!
FOUR!
Homesick? No
I'm sick of home
All it ever gave me
Were weekends on the phone
Feeling
Badly, but laughing
At the times that I passed up
Guess that wasn't enough, guess that wasn't enough
Homesick? No
I'm sick of home
All it ever gave me
Were weekends on the phone
Feeling
Badly, but laughing
At the times that I passed up
Guess that wasn't enough, GUESS THAT WASN'T ENOUGH!
