If they asked me I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write the preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers a friends

And that simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers a friends
