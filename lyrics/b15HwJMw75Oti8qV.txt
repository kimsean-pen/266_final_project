4 AM, don't wanna know
Who you're with and where you wanna go
It's been a while, I saw your face
No surprise I found you in this place
Don't you think that I, I'll come around
And try to hunt you down?
It's 4 AM, I don't wanna know

Don't say a word, I've heard enough, don't let me down

I want you to see me

Don't say a word, I've heard enough, don't let me down
I want you to need me
Shut your mouth
Shut your mouth and lay me down beside you now
I want you to see me
Shut your mouth
Don't say a word, I've heard enough, don't let me down
I want you to need me

Ah, I want you to need me
I want you to need me
Say what you wanna say now, say now
But when I got you on my own, I'll

Shut your mouth and lay me down beside you now
I want you to see me
Shut your mouth
Don't say a word, I've heard enough, don't let me down
I want you to need me
Shut your mouth (Shut your mouth)
Shut your mouth and lay me down beside you now (Lay me down)
I want you to see me
Shut your mouth
Don't say a word, I've heard enough, don't let me down
I want you to need me

I want you to need me
I want you to
