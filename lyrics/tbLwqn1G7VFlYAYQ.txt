They laugh and shout for eveyone to see
When they are together they are happy
Little children with innocent smiles
Who knows what may hide behind them

The sadness in the eyes of old folk around them
The children's spiteful games
They don't know you're hurting
Stop and look around you
For God's sake, look about you
Evil games, evil games

They tie you up, they tear your heart in two
One day they love, the next they hate you
When you're not looking they'll be out at night
To wander streets investigating

The sadness in the eyes of old folk around them
The children's spiteful games
They don't know you're hurting
Stop and look around you
For God's sake, look about you
Evil games, evil games

The sadness in the eyes of old folk around them
The children's spiteful games
They don't know you're hurting
Stop and look around you
For God's sake, look about you
Evil games, evil games

Evil games, evil games
Evil games, evil games
Evil games, evil games
Evil games, evil games
Evil games, evil games
