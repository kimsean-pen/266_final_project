Some are banned from knowing life as it is
Others know it way too well
Some lives are bound to dim away too fast
While others are doomed to vainly last
Forced out of their mothers' wombs
Taking path of least resistance
While others keep on measuring the void
For days on end

As here and now becomes a waiting room
For a brighter dawn
Which doesn't seem to come
We keep on waking up in a purgatory
Which is turning
Into the burial ground of ours
As future evaporates
We find ourselves stuck in a moment
On our way to eternity

Sometimes it's the act of running
Straight into the flames
And burning oneself to death
That makes the life worth living
And matter in the bigger picture
On a larger scale
In a wider context
