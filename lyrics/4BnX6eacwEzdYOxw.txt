First they ignore you, then laugh at you and hate you
Then they fight you, then you win
When the truth dies, very bad things happen
They're being heartless again

I know it's coming
There's gonna be violence
I've taken as much
As I'm willing to take

Why do you think
We should suffer in silence?
When a heart is broken
There's nothing to break

You've been mixing with some very heavy faces
The boys have done a bit of bird
They don't kill their own when they all love their mothers
But you're out of your depth son, have a word

I know it's coming
There's gonna be violence
I've taken as much
As I'm willing to take

Why do you think
We should suffer in silence?
The heart is broken
There's nothing to break

All is wonderful in this life
Dreaming of the sun she warms
You should see me in the afterlife
Picking up the sons of dust

When you think we're lost, we're exploring
What you think is worthless, I'm adoring
You don't want the truth, truth is boring
I got this fever

Need to leave the house, leave the car
Leave the bad men where they are
Leave a few shells in my gun
And stop me staring at the sun

I know it's coming
There's gonna be violence
I've taken as much
As I'm willing to take

Why do you say
We should suffer in silence?
My heart is broken
There's nothing to break
I know it's coming
There's gonna be violence
I've taken as much
As I'm willing to take
Why do you think
We should suffer in silence?
The heart is broken
There's nothing to break
