Say whatever you have to say,
I'll stand by you.
do whatever you have to do,
to get it out and not become a reaction memory
To hurt the ones you love
you know you never meant to but you do
oh yeah you do

Be whoever you have to be, I won't judge you
Sing whatever you have to sing
to get it out and not become a recluse about how to come out
I know you never meant to but you do
oh but you do

Still I need your sway, because you always pay for it
And I, and I need your soul
because your always soulful
And I and I need your heart,
because your always in the right places

And take whatever you have to take,
you know I love ya
come however you have to come,
and get it out and get it out

Tttttake it out on me, take it out on me
I'll give it you all,
I give it you all, I give it
I give you all
I give it you all,
yes I will give it you all

Cause I need your sway,
because you always pay for it
And I, and I need your soul
because your always soulful
And I and I need your heart,
because your always in the right places

Oh yes I will, I will give it you all

Still I need your sway,
because you always pay for it
And I, and I need your
soul because your always soulful
And I and I need that heart,
because your always in the right places.
