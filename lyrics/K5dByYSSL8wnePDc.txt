We are the misguided youth
They backed us into a corner
All our lives we've been infected
They should have never of had a chance

Because they're forcing us to believe
In a world we shouldn't trust
Delete, rewind
And try to change this state of mind

Give us something to believe in
Give us something to make our own
Give us something to believe in
Give us something to make our own

When will we stand up and choose our paths?

This is the end of the world
At least that's what we're told
This is the end of the world
Board up your windows and lock the doors

Turn out the lights, turn out the lights
Oh, this is getting old

We are the misguided youth
We sat back and lost our voices

Delete, rewind
Try to change this state of mind
Delete, rewind
And try to change this...

Because they're pushing us to the left
In a world we shouldn't trust
Delete, rewind
And try to change this state of mind

I don't believe you knew it all, you knew it all along
Delete, rewind, delete, rewind

When will we stand up
We've been through enough
When will we stand up
How'd we let them get the best of us?

When will we stand up
We've been through enough
When will we stand up
How'd we let them take the best of us?
