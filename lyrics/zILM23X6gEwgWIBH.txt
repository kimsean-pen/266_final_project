So there we were
Back home from somewhere inside my head
Well, bravely I fought off the monsters beneath her bed
Pillars of post-war books
Supported my frame of mind
While she memorized
The pages that I tried to not hide behind

She took my hand in hers
And whispered her love for me
The lantern died that night
But we didn't need to see
Implying that she's the bee's knees
And I am the cat's meow
It's funny how she recalls
What I can't remember now

But when her smile came back
And I didn't feel half as horrible
She gave me a heart attack
Just because she looked so adorable
We both put our sunblock on
Played on the beach,
And vowed that we'd live and we'd learn

Yeah, but she got a tan
And I got a sunburn

I got a sunburn

So there we were out there
Unaware of where we'd been
We kicked off our flip-flops
And swung from the rooftops again

It's awkward, but I'll confess she's all I can think about
And it's funny how I recall what she can't remember now

But when her smile came back
And I didn't feel half as horrible
She gave me a heart attack
Just because she looked so adorable

We both put our sunblock on
Played on the beach
And vowed that we'd live and we'd learn
Yeah, but she got a tan
And I got a sunburn

Oh, afterglow
Look out below
We left a trail of dust behind
As we parted ways
She held my gaze
And left an imprint on my mind

I tried not to cry as we said goodbye
And hung the clouds above my town
But I shed a tear when she disappeared
'Cause now I'm a stranger on the ground

(When her smile came back)
(And I didn't feel half as horrible)
(She gave me a heart attack)

We both put our sunblock on
Played on the beach
And vowed that we'd live and we'd learn
But she got a tan
And I got a sunburn

She got a tan
And I got a sunburn

Yeah, but she got a tan
And I got a sunburn
