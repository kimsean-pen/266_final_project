Do you wanna hear something sad?
We are but victims of desire
I'm gonna shake this thing
I wanna shake this pain before I retire

I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away

Bueno sera, i won't be long before we
all walk off the wire
Well i'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend for what I require

Bueno sera, i will come in quick
Don't want my flame to get no higher

I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away

Want to leave it all
Want to give it up
Want to see it go once and for all

Wanna feel withdrawal
Want an overhaul
Wanna be there, hard a statue
black as a tattoo, never to wash away

Gonna take me an astral plane
I'm gonna tunnel through denial
But i'm gonna shake this thing
I wanna shake this pain before i retire

I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
