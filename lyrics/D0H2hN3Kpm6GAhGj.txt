Love, you use love like a weapon
You love me like you're waging war
You love 'til I can stand no more
I feel so guilty and it burns
Me up inside 'til morning comes
Hey! You give me love and terror

Love, I can't tell you what I can't see
I only know what's true to me
The mirror you're holding is blocking my view
So I can't see and feel like you
Hey! You give me love and terror

We're not fooling each other
I can be clever but not clever enough
To make you trip and fall in love
Hey! You give me love and terror
