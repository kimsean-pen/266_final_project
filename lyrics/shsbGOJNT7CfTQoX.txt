Now that you want me it's too late
It's too late for love
Or when you got me
You don't care
It's too late for love

I'm tired, so tired of playing
Playing little games
My mind is made up
Uuuuuh uuuh
I'm not coming back to you

I need a man that treats me right
He'll treat me right
He'll feed me supper more than twice
Yes he will, yes yes, he will
I'm not asking for lots of fancy toys
I don't need a lot of fancy toys
Someone to keep me warm at night
Uuuuuuh uuh

So why why when you had me boy
You must've been blind
Goodbye, bye
Now you taste the teardrops that I cried

Uuuuuuh uuuuuuh
Uuuuuuh uh uuh uuuh
It's too late for love
