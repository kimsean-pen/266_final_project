All my life you know I haven't been very love strong
There's been so many fights that I fought and I never won
So I decided that I should just give up in trying to right your wrongs
And word on the street is she did to you what you did to me.

5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Bang, bang, bang boy!
You're goin' down, down, down, boy!
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
Bang! She shots you
Karma tastes so

Bang, bang, bang boy!
You're going down, down, down boy!
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
Bang! She shots you
Karma taste so sweet
So unfortunately for girls like me there are more like you
Bending and breaking the rules and we're makin' exceptions to.

But how does it feel to swim in your own tears?
You lied and you lied and I died and I died
And now you know why
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Bang, bang, bang boy!
You're going down, down, down, boy!

To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
Bang! She shots you
Karma tastes so
Bang, bang, bang boy!
You're going down, down, down boy!
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed

Bang! She shots you
Karma taste so sweet
...
Bang, bang, bang boy
You're going down, down, down, boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
Bang! She shots you
Karma tastes so
Bang, bang, bang boy!
You're going down, down, down boy!
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
Bang! She shots you
Karma taste so
Bang, bang, bang boy!
You're going down
To the ground
