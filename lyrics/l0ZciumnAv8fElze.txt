Sky burns, no return
You sweat the hate from your flesh
Rejoice through the void
Consumed by loss of breath

Human greed is our destruction
The abyss of your seduction
Demure, suffer
The grief a burden to bear

No pain, walk on fire
Holy mystic aura

Cenobites I know your kind
Dead behind the eyes
Self-inflikted – Cenobites
Dead behind the eyes

Endless, deathless
A cryptic inner fear
What's left, the wretched
And those who speak in your ear

Eviscerate your own impressions
Die along with your transgressions
Menace, penance
Horrific path to ascension

No pain, walk on fire
Holy mystic aura

Cenobites I know your kind
Dead behind the eyes
Self-inflikted – Cenobites
Dead behind the eyes

Dead behind the eyes!

All the flesh eaters, skin crawlers
They tear you limb from limb
Blood feeders, Hellraisers
These vermin feed my rage!

Dead behind the eyes!

Do you purge fire, shed light
Or let them come tonight?
Nephilim, Seraphim
The lost paradise

Cenobites (Cenobites)
I know your kind (I know your kind)
You're all dead (All fucking dead)
Behind the eyes
