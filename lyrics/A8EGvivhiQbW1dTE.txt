Pulled up smellin' like the gas
Yeah you know it's us
Girl sippin' syrup
Booty twerkin' on the tour bus
3 deep in the two seat
Foot up in the clutch
3 deep in the two seat
Yeah yeah yeah
Cop the camo shark
Now I'm drippin' in this blue Bape
In that white soft top
Arm and hammer tooth paste
Gucci blue jeans
With the hand embroidered snakes
I stack that guala got my mom a new place
On a backroad
Rollin' doobies in the moonlight
Y'all know
I got plenty bitches like maroon five
Ima glo
Swear to god these diamonds shinin' too bright
Drivin' slow
I mix up the tommy with the off white
Drop top in the winter with the heat on
10k thread count all i sleep on
I ball out with this tommy jeans tee on
Vacay in sweden chillin' at the ski lodge
You phony with us not recording with us
In the tweets but for a feature they'll be cordule with us
Boy you broke you can't afford to kick it
I get this money with the team
Count it up and split it
Its courtney love in my cup
Doubled up
What the fuck she want
Diamonds in the bezel
Heavy metal what the fuck we on
Pedal to the metal
Marijuna in my fuckin lungs
In that 2 seat 6 speed
Foot up in the clutch
Pulled up smellin' like the gas
Yeah you know it's us
Girl sippin' syrup
Booty twerkin' on the tour bus
3 deep in the two seat
Foot up in the clutch
3 deep in the two seat
Yeah yeah yeah
