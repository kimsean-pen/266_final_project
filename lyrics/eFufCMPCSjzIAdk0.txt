If this isn't what you see
It doesn't make you blind
Yea, if this doesn't make you feel
It doesn't mean you've died

Where the river's high
Where the river's high

If you don't want to be seen
Well you don't have to hide
And if you don't want to believe
Well you don't have to try

to feel alive,
yea
Alive in the superunknown
Alive in the superunknown

Alive in the superunknown
First it steals your mind and then it steals your
If this doesn't make you free
It doesn't mean you're tied

If this doesn't take you down
It doesn't mean you're high
If this doesn't make you smile
Yea, you don't have to cry

If this isn't making sense
Yea, it doesn't make it lies, oh
Alive in the superunknown
Alive in the superunknown

Alive in the superunknown
First it steals your mind and then it steals your soul, oh
Get yourself afraid
Get yourself alone
Get yourself contained

Get yourself control, control
Oh, oh
Alive in the superunknown
Alive in the superunknown
Alive in the superunknown
Alive in the superunknown
Alive in the superunknown
Alive in the superunknown
Alive in the superunknown
First it steals your mind and then it steals your
First it steals your mind and then it steals your
First it steals your mind and then it steals your soul
