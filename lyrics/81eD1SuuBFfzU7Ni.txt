So bleed the way, ease the pain
We've been through a lot
In darkest days I find hope
So find the reason, hands are freezing
Even when it's hot
Here I'm drowning in a quicksand

So why should I stay
Many roads still remain
Ahead and silent
Voices gone with the wind
Where should I start
When the world falls apart
No one's got the answer
Just let me know what's coming after

Breathe it out, breathe it out, mannequin
I shouldn't have set you free

So why should I stay
Many roads still remain
Ahead and silent
All these years of decay
Where should I start
When the world falls apart
No one's got the answer
It's haunting me forever

I keep lying to myself
Desperate
I place a photo on empty shelf
Separate
I shouldn't ever deceive myself
Heartedness
In saving me you trapped yourself
Selflessness
