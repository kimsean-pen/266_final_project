Did you run through doors, 'til you hit the floor?
Did you read my eyes, and my aching thoughts?
Did you walk through walls, 'til you had to crawl?
Oh my god your smile and my soundless calls

Chorus:
Get up, get up, get up, my heart is heavy
Sit up, sit up, sit up, enough already
Take this, don't look without seeing me
Stay here, don't touch without feeling me

Did the light leave holes, where the ceiling rolled
Did you lay your head, as it all took hold
Did you spin so slow, I didn't see you go
Oh I wish I had, I wish I had known

Chorus:

And you're two feet away from my arms
But my head is weighed down by the spark
And it's too much to take when you turn
When I still haven't seen what i've learned

Chorus:
