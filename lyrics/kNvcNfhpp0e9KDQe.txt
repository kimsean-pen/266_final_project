OK, it's alright with me
some things are just meant to be
it never comes easily
and when it does I'm already gone

I'm practic'lly never still
more likely to move until
I end up alone at will
my life continues inching along

When Bernadette comes, I get lost on her time
she's much too sweet and she's always gonna be
and when I return to her arms and her eyes
it might not be the same but it's alright with me

OK it's alright with me (alright with me)
some people are scared to see (are scared to see)
what's happening frequently
but I would never shy from a fight
heart beat with high demand often will go hand in hand
but I'm sick of just starting plans
I wanna spend the rest of my life

When Bernadette comes, I get lost on her time
she's much too sweet and she's always gonna be
and when I return to her arms and her eyes
it might not be the same but it's alright with me
it's alright with me 3x

OK it's alright with me
oh it's alright with me 2x
OK it's alright with me

OK it's alright with me
some thigs are just meant to be
it never comes easily
and when it does I'm already gone
