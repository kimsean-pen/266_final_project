Come down to the surface
The surface reflects the light
Beneath the outer
The darkness obscures the light
Come down to the shallows
In contours
Out of the rivers
Your sea pours
Wait for the water
To claim you
Your sea returning
Into the waves
Into the wind waves
Into the waves
Curling heights
Back into the center
Receding from a further shore
Sinking familiar
Clinging to blackest floors

Come out to the shallows
In contours
Into the rivers your sea pours
Wait for the water to claim you
Your sea returning
Into the waves
Into the wind waves
Into the waves
Curling heights

Come down to the shallows
In contours
Out of the rivers
Your sea pours
Wait for the water
To claim you
Your sea returning
Into the waves
Into the wind waves
Into the waves
Curling heights
