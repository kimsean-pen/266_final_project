Keeps me feeling low
Keeps me feeling low

Here's a shot in the dark
A chance I shouldn't take
If I dive in again don't let me sink
You could be the remedy
Only one dose and I'm out of sight
I could be the drug trapped in your mind
Trapped in your mind

Before you go
Tell me I'm worth dying for
All the things you were promising
Give it up, put it all on me
Lose your grip and now it's out of reach
Don't believe in what you cannot see
All the things you will never know
It keeps me, keeps me feeling low

Is this all that we are
A stitch that pulled apart?
You told me I was your best mistake
That you were taking to the grave
And I don't know where to start
So tell me
Are we taking this way too far?
Please tell me
I'm not a shot in the dark

Before you go
Tell me I'm worth dying for
All the things you were promising
Give it up, put it all on me
Lose your grip and now it's out of reach
Don't believe in what you cannot see
All the things you will never know
It keeps me, keeps me feeling low

Is there something you want?
Is there something you need from me?

So go
And tell me I'm worth dying for
All the things you were promising
Give it up, put it all on me
Lose your grip and now it's out of reach
Don't believe in what you cannot see
It keeps me, keeps me feeling low
It keeps me low
