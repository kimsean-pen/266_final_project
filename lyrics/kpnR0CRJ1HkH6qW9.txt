Oh, who is raised by the sword can't be beaten
Who is toughened by the fire can't be burned
Awaited by immortality
Are the ones sacrificing their lives
To blood, to victory, to the truth

As ye sow, as shall ye reap
We will turn your fields into death shining
Our blades smash all down
Guidance of cold winds
We complete the ancient rule
Each of us was created to kill

Hail the wisest ones
You have walked the severe and harsh path
To the almighty crown
Soon the lost riddles will be solved
Once and for all
As the ageless earth praises your sword

As ye sow, as shall ye reap
We will turn your fields into death shining
Our blades smash all down
Guidance of cold winds
We complete the ancient rule
Each of us was created to kill

Oh, raise the wind
Oh, open up earth
Oh, wild waters flood
And flames burn the ruins they own
Burn all and everything they own

Now let your prayers fade
The weak ones will meet their gruesome fate
Loyal minds will not break
The bold people of war
Have raised to get their victory
You depend on our mercy

Who is raised by the sword can't be beaten
Who is toughened by the fire can't be burned
Our everlasting loyalty
Will never break
The bold people of war
Have raised their swords
