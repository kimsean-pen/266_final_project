Alone and coming down as my tears create a sea
Have I been away so long that the devil's nesting for me?
Right now if you could see, right now attacking me
Hold on desperately, you'll never get to me

Take a look around, help me
I see this losing little face staring at me

Run away, diseased and torn, the depression's ecstasy
Have I been away so long that the devil's coming for me?
Right now if you could see, right now attacking me
Hold on desperately, you'll never get to me

Take a look around, help me
I see this losing little face staring at me
Looking for that special sound that's coming for me
It's never gonna take me down, please, come for me, please, come for me

Please, come for me, please, come for me
Please, come for me, please, come for me
Please, come for me, please, come for me
Please, come for me

They are coming
They are coming
They are coming
They are coming

Take a look around, help me
I see this losing little face staring at me
Looking for that special sound that's coming for me
It's never gonna take me down, please, come for me, please, come for me

They are coming
They are coming
They are coming
They are coming
