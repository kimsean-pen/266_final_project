So let me set the scene
It's 2 in the afternoon and 34 degrees
The Queensland harsh summer heat
Had me sweating buckets all up and down my street
It was there I spotted the bloke
Perched atop of his milk crate throne
He eyed me off as I approached
Then he said

I'm on smoko, so leave me alone
I'm on smoko, so leave me alone
I'm on smoko, so leave me alone
I'm on smoko, so leave me alone

I'm on smoko, so leave me alone
I'm on smoko, so leave me alone
I'm on smoko, so leave me alone
I'm on smoko, so leave me alone

So it's Tuesday morning and my Centrelink hasn't come through
So I pick up the phone 'cause I've got some abusing to do
But all I get is elevator music
Waiting on the line
On hold all the time
All I get is elevator music
Waiting on the line
'Til I get a reply

I'm on smoko, so leave me alone
I'm on smoko, so leave me alone
I'm on smoko, so leave me alone
I'm on smoko, so leave me alone

Aw, what time is it?
Is it smoko?

I'm on smoko, so leave me alone
I'm on smoko, so leave me alone
I'm on smoko, so leave me alone
I'm on smoko, so leave me alone

I'm on smoko
I'm on smoko, so leave me alone
