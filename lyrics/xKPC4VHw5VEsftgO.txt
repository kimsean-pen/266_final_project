Bladeecity
1000 diamonds
I stay out of sight
It's a satellite life
Got a shadow ice knife
Gucci lenses on my eyes
Bank account match my clothing size
That explains the price
Of my shoes
I got news
You can get cut up like fruit
Bladee one sound like akon when i make songs
Say some wrong you may run
You get rained on
Someone rather then no one
I got no one
I was so wrong
Waiting so long
You were no one
Hold on
I should go home
To the chrome zone
No ozone
Sold my soul now my souls gone
I hold the map
I got the keys to the city
GTB I see machines in the city
Helicopters when we leave in december
On my LG
Call my team we assemble
Im beyond I don't belive in the system
You can sing
I press delete
I don't listen
I got items
I'm complete for no reason
Got no meaning
Pull a the card get a reading
Thaiboy goon I got that weed in my system
You can sing I press delete
I don't listen
I got cash I pull up clean for no reason
On my iPhone call my team now I'm beaming
Thaiboy goon im at the scene when i'm dreaming
Gtbsg we riding with no ceiling
Yung Thaiboy Goon I'm posted in the building
You can sing I press delete I don't listen
