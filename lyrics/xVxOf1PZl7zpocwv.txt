Speak through the silence
Lay down your crown
Lay down your fight

And when you speak
The words of silence
Walls will crumble in
And skies open

And when you speak
You speak with silence, and I
Carve each word you sing
On my stone wings
And the light will pour in

The fires are burning, under starlight
Through veils of golden light
The sails so pure, so white
Through the river of death
I carry you, my love

Breathe in the night
My arms alight

And when you speak
The words of silence
Walls will crumble in
And skies open

And when you speak
You speak with silence, and I
Carve each word you sing
On my stone wings
And the light will pour in now

I threw this iron crown
Into the eye of inferno
This lake of fire, this pit of ghosts
Breathing in the dark
Exhaling the dust of stars

In this shrine of silver light
On the edge of the moon, you sing to me
The river flows deep
Through my heart and through my eyes
As you turn into the light
The dust of silver stars

And then you speak
The words of silence
Walls will crumble in
And skies open

And when you speak
You speak with silence, and I
Carve each word you sing
On my stone wings
And the light will pour in
Carve each word you sing
On my stone wings now
