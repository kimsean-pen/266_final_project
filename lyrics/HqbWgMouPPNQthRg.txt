In 1983
In a Texas facility
He was just a few months old when they
Told him he was sold

They flew the primate pet
Upon a private jet
And off to Neverland where he
Met the impish man

Feasting on candy
And dressed like a dandy
Bubbles was treated
Like no other chimpanzee
Transported to a planet made of toys, bananas, and games

Childhoods end
And Bubbles burst

We met in the arcade
Playing video games
We both could not believe it was
Like living in a dream

We didn't understand
Dancing with Peter Pan
What would be the result when we
Turned into young adults

Feasting on candy
And dressed like a dandy
Bubbles was treated
Like no other chimpanzee
Transported to a planet made of toys, bananas, and games

Childhoods end
And Bubbles burst
