Oh, my dear Lovisa
You talk so different when we're not alone
Oh, my dear Lovisa
Say you got feelings but you act so cold

I love the way you dance around naked in the living room
But every high just leads to lows
Still what hurts the most
Is I can't let go

Oh, my dear Lovisa
Your name keeps coming up in all my songs
Oh, my dear Lovisa
I'm feeling weak because my heart feelings strong

I love it when we're in the sheets
Talking 'till you fall asleep
But every high just leads to lows
Still what hurts the most
Is I can't let go
Go
Let go (Let go)
Go (Let go)

Lovisa
Lovisa
Lovisa
Lovisa

Oh, every high just leads to lows
Still what hurts the most
Is I can't let go (is that I can't let go)
Go

So my dear Lovisa
If you love me just let me know
