Where am I? Sleeping at the console.
I dreamt something, that I don't remember.
Checking in, just like any other.
Signing off, signing out forever.

You're secondhand,
That's the reason why you're easy to drive.
You understand,
That's the reason why you're easy to hide.

My head says yes but I was sedated.
signing off, Checking in together.

You're secondhand,
That's the reason why you're easy to drive.
You understand,
That's the reason why you're easy to hide.
You joined a band,
That's the reason why you're easy to try.
You understand,
That's the reason why you're easy to hide.
