I am never truly alone
Acceptance is slipping in, gripping limbs
It's crooked fingers intertwine
They cradle us together
A hundred years alone could never make it stop
Push it back
I cannot fit
I cannot feel
They should not see, suspended in time
And their eyes are like razors the edges can sharpen the line
This is love
This is ordinary life
What a thrill stringing up splendid lights to paralyze
They burn to the touch
Pretending at God
Listen to the blood
Razor blade eyes
I want a Goddamn mess
To ignite the fire
I want to lie in severance
Leave me to cut my teeth
Pretending at God is a custom
The vessel to syphon my love from
Their eyes are a razor to cut me down, cut me down
This is love
This is love
This is ordinary life
What a thrill cheap enough to get caught on the edge this time
Razor blade eyes
This is love
This is love
Make it stop
This is love
This is love
Make it stop
Make it stop
This is love
This is love
Make it stop
This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love
