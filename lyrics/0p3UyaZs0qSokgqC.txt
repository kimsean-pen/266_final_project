I, I built a wall
I built it up when I was young
I, I didn't know
How could I know I built it up?

It's all gone
The family has moved on
And I don't know if it's your fault or my fault
It's all gone
I know without it I'm dead wrong
But I don't know if it's your fault or my fault

You, you took a loan
You bought a house and built it up
Oh, I'm sure you know
I felt alone, I couldn't stop
(Stop)

It's all gone
The family has moved on
And I don't know if it's your fault or my fault
It's all gone
I know without it I'm dead wrong
But I don't know if it's your fault or my fault
It's your fault
