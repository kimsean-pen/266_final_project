Oh she's a dying art
She's a weathered leaf,
At times a thunderstorm

And he's a prodigal son, with his back to the wall,
He's an atomic bomb

And she said she said and she says: I remember you,
Your switch-blade eyes

The coolest thing to do,
Was to let you come inside, hands behind my back,
My tongue tied, bear with me now, Let's go for a ride

Oh she's a dying art
She's a weathered leaf,
At times a thunderstorm

And I'm a prodigal boy,
With my back to the wall,
I'm the atomic bomb

And she said she said and she says: I remember you,
Your switch-blade eyes

The coolest thing to do,
Was to let you come inside, hands behind my back,
My tongue tied, bear with me now, Let's go for a ride

I remember you,
Your switch-blade eyes

The coolest thing to do,
Was to let you come inside, hands behind my back,
My tongue tied, bear with me now? Let's go for a ride
For a ride (2x)
