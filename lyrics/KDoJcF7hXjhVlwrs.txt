These unfamiliar streets, I hide my face and name
And these secrets that I keep, every stranger looks the same

The cold New England air, it rips the(?)
And I replace it with the ache, the ash, the dirt, and lack of love
No hands to hold, no hands to pray for me

My lover left alone, my lover left to grieve and mourn
My sins, my cross to bear, the guilt, the vows I broke in turn

This precious sacrament took the bottle of prayer each night
One hand to the altar and the other to the wind
(?) perish from the church
Snow is falling quietly
(?) in my steps until the dark into the streets

No hands to hold, no hands to pray for me

My lover left alone, my lover left to grieve and mourn
My sins, my cross to bear, the guilt, the vows I broke in turn
My lover left alone, my lover left to grieve and mourn
My sins, my cross to bear, the guilt, the vows I broke in turn
