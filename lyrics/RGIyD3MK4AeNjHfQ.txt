Continuous or recurring feelings
That you're an outside observer of your thoughts
Feeling like you are a robot
Or feeling like you are living in a dream or in a movie
The sensation that you're not in control of your actions
Including speaking
Awareness that your sense of detachment
Is only a feeling, and not reality
The sense that your body, legs or arms
Appear distorted, enlarged, or shrunken
Feeling like you are observing yourself
From above
As if you were floating in the air
