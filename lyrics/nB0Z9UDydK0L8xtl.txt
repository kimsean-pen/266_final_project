Why you gotta go to sleep?
Don't go to sleep
Don't go to sleep
Let's go out
Get blown away
Lost in the dark
Get real high
And never come down

Why you gotta go to sleep?
Don't go to sleep
Don't go to sleep
Let's go out
Get blown away
Lost in the dark
Get real high
And never come down

Come on baby, put your hands on my hands
Dance with your lips on my lips
Wanna taste your heart; don't interfere
Into the night, we'll disappear

Just take my hand
Yeah, take my hand
Yeah, take my hand
(Let's dance)
Won't you please just take my hand?

Can you feel the neon lights?
It's like the milky way
I swear that something stupid is making me stay awake
And now I'm on the cloud, I'm talking extra loud
I keep on dancing, gonna lose my body in the crowd

Why you gotta go to sleep?
Don't go to sleep
Don't go to sleep
Let's go out
Get blown away
Lost in the dark
Get real high
And never come down

Just take my hand
Yeah, take my hand
Yeah, take my hand
(Let's dance)
Won't you please just take my hand?

Come on baby, put your hands on my hands
Dance with your lips on my lips
Wanna taste your heart; don't interfere
Into the night, we'll disappear

Come on baby, put your hands on my hands
Dance your lips on my lips
Wanna taste your heart; don't interfere
Into the night, we'll disappear

Just take my hand
Yeah, take my hand
Yeah, take my hand
(Let's dance)
Won't you please just take my hand?
(Let's dance)
Won't you please just take my hand?
(Let's dance)
Won't you please just take my hand?
(I'm in your hand)
(I'm in your hand)
