So soon we, so soon we, so soon we too old to carry
And we knew we, and we knew we, and we knew we only had a little while
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle, just keep ticking over
Before you know it, before you know it, before you know
They pair and pair
And ooohhh

To have it all, to have it all, to have it all, and still want more
One thing's for sure,
One thing's for sure, one thing's for sure, we're all
Getting older
So we take a lover, so we take a lover,
So we take a lover, waitin' in the corner
And before you know it, before you know it,
Before you know we're pushing up the daisies
Oooohhh

And we're going back to where we came from
For those before and those to come and owe is the effort

And the more
And again and again and again and again we go
In the end, in the end, in the end, nothing comes easy
So you find a way,
So you find a way, so you find a way to take a little
With you
For the ones you love,
For the ones you love, for the ones you love, are
There if they need to
The hero, the hero, the hero
They're not coming with you
Go back to where we came from
For those before and those to come and owe is the effort
And the more
And again and again and again and again
Go...
Oooohhh
So soon we, so soon we, so soon we too old to carry
And we knew we, and we knew we, and we knew we only had a little while

In the middle, in the middle, in the middle, just keep ticking over
Before you know it,
Before you know it, before you know they pair and pair
And go back to where we came from
For those before and those to come and owe is the effort
And the more
And again and again and again and again
We go...
Go...
