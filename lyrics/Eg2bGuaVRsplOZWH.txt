I know I said that you are cute and said I like your eyes
But your eyes look too much in mind have looked away
You say hello, I say goodbye
I never meant to make you cry, wah, wah, wah

I'm really sorry that I have to let you down
I'm really sorry that I'm turning this around
The things I said before at the time were true
But now the truth has changed because I don't like you

You want to hang out after school I don't know what I should say
Because it's all my fault I let you this way
You say I do, I want to die
I'm too caught up, I'm going to cry, wah, wah, wah

I'm really sorry that I have to let you down
I'm really sorry that I'm turning this around
The things I said before at the time were true
But now the truth has changed because I don't like you

You say hello, I want to die
You say I do and I think I'm gonna cry
You say I do and I think I'm gonna cry

I don't like you
I don't like you
I don't like you
I don't like you
