They said "sleep is for the weak"
And i gave into the mantra
The scene was derelict;
The facebook propaganda
My router is a candle
That ignites my slin innocence
And i see how this was so full
But i liked the blue brittleness of the night timer

Curious camgirls
Cruel and kind cherry boys
They were restless for those refills
Superimposed on a greem screen
Your aimless web surfing
And arranged brain battling
I just wanted to be r. crumb
Sitting like a clot in my brain
In the night time
