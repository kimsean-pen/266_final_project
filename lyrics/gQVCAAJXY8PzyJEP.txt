Take a look past our innocence
Take a step back to yesterday
When life would move slower
We would never grow up
All we know that love was for when we're older
And anything could happen
Secretly imagine
They could never tear us apart
Too young to fall

This is our story
That we could take back some day
Our lonely glory
That we could get back, they say
This is our story
That we could take back some day
Our hope if only
We could take back some day

This is our story
That we could take back some day
Our hope if only
We could take back some day

Take a look past our innocence
Take a step back to yesterday
When life would move slower
We would never grow up
All we know that love was for when we're older
And anything could happen
Secretly imagine
They could never tear us apart
Too young to fall

This is our story
That we could take back some day
Our hope if only
We could take back some day
Some day
Some day
Some day
Some day
Some day
Some day

We could take back some day

We could take back some day

This is our story
That we could take back some day
Our lonely glory
That we could get back, they say
This is our story
That we could take back some day
Some day
Some day
Some day
Some day
Some day
Some day

We could take back some day

Our hope, if only
We could take back some day
