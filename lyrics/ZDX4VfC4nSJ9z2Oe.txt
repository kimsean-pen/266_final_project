Remember when we used to look how sun set far away
And how you said this is never over
I believed your every word, and I guess you did, too
But now you're saying, hey, let's think this over

You take my hand and pull me next to you, so close to you
I have a feeling that you don't have the words
I found one for you, kiss your cheek, say bye, and walk away
Don't look back, 'cause I am crying

I remember little things you hardly ever do
Tell me why I don't know why it's over
I remember shooting stars, the walk we took that night
I hope your wish came true, mine betrayed me

You let my hand go and you fake a smile for me
I have a feeling you don't know what to do
I look deep in your eyes, hesitate a while
Why are you crying?

Tallulah
It's easier to live alone than fear the time it's over
Whoa, Tallulah
Find the words and talk to me, oh

Tallulah
This could be
(Heaven)

I see you walking hand in hand with long-haired drummer of the band
In love with her, or so it seems, he's dancing with my beauty queen
Don't even dare to say your "hi", still swallowing the goodbye
But I know the feeling's still alive, still alive

I lost my patience once, so do you punish me now?
I'll always love you, no matter what you do
I'll win you back for me if you give me a chance
But there is one thing you must understand

Tallulah
It's easier to live alone than fear the time it's over
Whoa, Tallulah
Find the words and talk to me, oh

Tallulah
This could be

Tallulah
It's easier to live alone than fear the time it's over
Tallulah
Find the words and talk to me, oh

Tallulah
This could be
