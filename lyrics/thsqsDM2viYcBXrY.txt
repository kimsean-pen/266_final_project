I, I, I didn't sleep last night.
No you, you you never really got me.
I, I'm not the kind of girl, that kisses and tells the world,
And I'm not the kind of guy you need, but somehow we both keep believing.

Yeah every girl has given up, but I'm the one who'll stand by you.
Can't you feel my heartbeat listen up, disaster boy, I'm tellin' you.
Don't you pin your heart on my sleeve, don't you pin your heart on my sleeve.

I, I woke up from your late phone calls,
It's true I might have drank a bit too much, but girl, I need you.
I, I'm not the kind of girl, that gives you a second chance.
And I'm not (?) down on one knee, but somehow we both keep believing.

Yeah every girl has given up, but I'm the one who'll stand by you.
Can't you feel my heartbeat listen up, disaster boy, I'm tellin' you.
Don't you pin your heart on my sleeve, don't you pin your heart on my sleeve.

Every girl has given up, I still thought I could count on you.
Tried to play it cool, but I screwed it up, disaster boy what can I do.
Don't you pin your heart on my sleeve, don't you pin your heart on my sleeve.
Don't you pin your heart on my sleeve, don't you pin your heart on my eyes.

Yeah every girl has given up, but I'm the one who'll stand by you.
Can't you feel my heartbeat listen up, disaster boy, I'm tellin' you.
Don't you pin your heart on my sleeve, don't you pin your heart on my sleeve.
