Breathe, breathe easy now
Maybe I can show you how
Speak, speak freely now
In the everness of now

Breathe, breathe easy now
In the everness of now
See, see clearly now
In the everness of now

Wake up to the war on for your mind
I need you to fill me deep inside
Symbols, meanings hidden in plain sights
Keep you in the dark and from the light

I am a dream come true

Breathe, breathe easy now
In the everness of now
Dream, dream sweeter now
In the everness of now

Wake up to the war on for your mind
I need you to fill me deep inside
Symbols, meanings hidden in plain sights
Keep you in the dark and from the light

The everness of now

I am like a lion, never lose, no sleep
Over the thoughts and opinions of the brainwashed sheep
Your time will come, your river, it will run
Summer skies will light your light
The kingdom's all inside

Wake up to the war on for your mind
