I said I wanna come over
you said 'ok just come over'
your friends are all on the couch
your friends said 'let's walk around'
I'll pretend your friends are my friends
and kinda try not to offend them
but I won't let you see anything real
let you know, there's limits to--
CHORUS:
I stopped talking an hour ago
I stopped talking an hour ago
I stopped talking an hour ago
I stopeed talking an hour ago
It's a predictable point of view
this group dynamic caters to
it's a particular point of view
I think you know when it caters to you
(and if you do know don't act like you
don't 'cause it's really annoying, and if
you don't know, well, let's just say,
you're a lot lot stupider than I thought.)
I'll pretend your friends are my friends
but I don't wanna hear you defend them
in fact that kind of insults me and
I kinda don't really wanna be here right--
CHORUS:
I stopped talking an hour ago
I stopped talking an hour ago
I stopped talking an hour ago
I stopped talking an hour ago, ago...
OK: Your whole thing put me in
negative space for way too long
the only thing I managed to say during
that time was 'I hate danger'.
what I really should have said is:
'you're so not dangerous. you're so
not what you say you are at all.'
