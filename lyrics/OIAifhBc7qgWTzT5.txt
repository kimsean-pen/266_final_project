Visions of hornshaped shadows
A burning firmanent black
Trembling in the glory of a star
Delightfully glowing with evil
Ten signs to spawn
A thousand of children
And to be given strength
Each time a heart it beats

For they gave birth to the sun and the moon
To cast shadows upon life
And to burn the slaves that in madness gaze
With scorn from serpent eyes

Just as cancerous cocaine
Deep in the veins of christ
The malignant curse divine
Floats within you all...
You all!

May the holy light of Satans might
Burn my eyes!
This filth is not worth the glance...
Shining steel with Devil's seal
Cut my flesh!
Let them lick the blood
In the ashes of my fallen temple

And just as cancerous cocaine
Deep in the veins of christ
The malignant curse divine
Floats within you all
And the bonds are burning
Along with His eyes
Forever to brand the heart of god
Forever... spearing cosmos core!

For it was that light
That branded the Devil's mark
Into my flesh
My soul and my heart
Never to close these eyes
Never to still this thirst
High on the cross of sophia
Through black salvation I hang cursed
