Walk you home to see
Where you're living around.
And I know this place.
Pour yourself on me,
And you know I'm the one
That you won't forget.

In your denim eyes,
I see something's right,
When I see your wink.
When he comes around,
I see you're fixing the shine,
And my face won't speak.

Hate to be so emotional,
I didn't mean to get physical,
But when he pulled in and revved it up,
I said you call that a pickup truck,
And in the moonlight I throwed him down.
A kicking, screaming, a rolling around.
A little piece of a bloody tooth,
Just so you know I was thinking of you,
Just so you know I was ohh

Trembling knees are weak,
And its cold as a hole,
Hug your bones and skin.
Crackling wood's gone white,
And my eyes swolled up now,
I can see the light.

Hate to be so emotional,
I didn't mean to get physical,
But when he pulled in and revved it up,
I said you call that a pickup truck,
And in the moonlight I throwed him down.
A kicking, screaming, a rolling around.
A little piece of a bloody tooth,
Just so you know I was thinking of you,
Just so you know I oh
Just so you know I oh
Just so you know I oh

A little piece of a bloody tooth,

Just so you know I was thinking of you,
Just so you know I oh
