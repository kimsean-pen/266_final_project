You, you have entered this world with a virus
Tortured man, broken man, just a piece of filth
Devoured by your thirst and conquered by your lust
Taken by force, the victims left
Send the letter to mother
Tell how your devoured daughter
Dismembered little girl
So the sadomasochist
Ci, devouring the flesh
Oh, you push the needles in
Path to set this stage again
His skin upon him will bare eternal pain
Sickened man, withered man, he feels no shame
Inside his soul he mourns, the pain he has endured
Indulged in blood, they are now one
Send the letter to mother
Tell how your devoured daughter
Dismembered little girl
So the sadomasochist
Ci, devouring the flesh
Oh, you push the needles in
Path to set this stage again
In his sin he found salvation
In his sin he found salvation
Innocence means mutilation
In his sin he found salvation
Little sins, decapitation
Salvation, mutilation
Salvation, decapitation
So the sadomasochist
Ci, devouring the flesh
Oh, you push the needles in
Path to set this stage again
Sociopath, sociopath
