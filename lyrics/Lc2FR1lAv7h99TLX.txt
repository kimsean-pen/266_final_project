What happened to you
You're like everyone else
I thought I knew you
You hardly know yourself

Whats even left to say
When you feel nothing inside
And all you know is pain
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it
I can see it in your

Don't let them take you
They want to own your life
Then they exchange you
For the next one in line

Whats even left to say
When you feel nothing inside
And all you know is pain
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it
I can see it in your

Don't walk away
Maybe you should stay and talk to me
Don't walk away
Maybe you should stay and talk to me
Don't walk away
Maybe you should stay and talk to me
Don't walk away
Maybe you should stay and talk to me

Whats even left to say
When you feel nothing inside
And all you know is pain
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it
I can see it in your
