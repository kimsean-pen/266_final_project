Darling you mean the whole wide world to me
Darling you are sweeter than I ever dreamed
Darling you make me believe in make believe
Darling you mean the whole wide world to me

What do I do with all this love for you?
It's so much more than I ever knew
Baby girl, it's bigger than the whole wide world

Darling you mean the whole wide world to me
Darling you light up everyone you meet
With a smile you give away so easily
Darling you mean the whole wide world to me

What do I do with all this love for you?
It's so much more than I ever knew
What do I do with how I feel inside?
If you ever wonder how much I
Love you girl, it's bigger than the whole wide world

It's bigger than the whole wide world
