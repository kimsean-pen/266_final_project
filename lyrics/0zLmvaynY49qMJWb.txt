Things aren't quite as they seem

Inside my domain

You can't know about everything
Only pleasure and pain

You wonder why I come here

With head to my hands

Where else can I be cured
And the king of your mansion
A thorn in your side

A child to protect
That claims he's free

Just around the corner

Half a mile to heaven

Strong enough to hold you
Starved for some affection

Darling, come quickly

Come ease my mind

For my prayers have not been answered
In a long time

I've already made my bed
Like it or not

As long as there's no regrets
I'll be here when the ride stops
These comforts to me

And these crosses to bear

With which we live
Just around the corner
Half a mile to heaven
Strong enough to hold you
Starved for some affection
Baby, I can't drag you into this mess
I'm the thorn in your side
And the child to protect
And I'm just around the corner
Half a mile to heaven, oh
Oh, Strong enough to hold you
Starved for some affection
Darling, come quickly
Come ease my worried mind
For my prayers have not been answered
In a long time
In a long time
