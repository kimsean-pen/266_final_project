Something unseen and far away and nothing like you might
want it to be. Stop finding ways around seeking what's still unfound.
Find your way up from the ground.
Looking for your melody and tracing lines to find your way
through mazes and labyrinths of hardened hearts and harmonies.
Wherever you may end up you'll find yourself thinking about when
all of the things you called reality stopped being there for you, and
that's when you ran away. Plotting your plan, the blueprints of your
mind forming a puzzle of formulas and frequencies to help ease
the troubled breeze.
