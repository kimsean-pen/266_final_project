Welcome to your life.
there's no turning back.
even while we sleep.
we will find you
acting out your best behavior
turn your back on mother nature
everybody wants to rule the world.

it's my own desire
it's my own reward.
help me to decide
help me make the most of freedom
and our pleasure
nothing ever lasts forever.
everybody wants to rule the world.

there's a room where the light won't find you,
holding hands while the walls come tumbling down.
when they do, i'll be right behind you.
so glad, we've almost made it;
so sad, they had to take it.
everybody wants to rule the world.
I can't stand this indecision
married with a lack of vision
everybody wants to rule the world
Say that you'l never never never need it
one headline, why believe it?
everybody wants to rule the world
All for freedom and for pleasure
nothing lasts forever
everybody wants to rule the world
