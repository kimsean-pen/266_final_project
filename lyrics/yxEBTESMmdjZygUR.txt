I take a pill to help me through the day
I stay inside until I feel okay

I've always been so cautious
But I'm sick of feeling nauseous
It's not that I am losing
This wall of my own choosing

Take me on a ride
Show me how to hide the voice in my head
Meet me on the road, tell me all you know
I'm here on my own

Take me on a ride
Show me how to hide the voice in my head
You've got away with my anxiety
It's yours to take back

I walk alone, I stumble to the beat
My stack of drums are always on repeat
You never win when losing is a game
Inside your head there's no one else to blame

I've always been so cautious
But I'm sick of feeling nauseous
It's not that I am losing
This wall of my own choosing

Take me on a ride
Show me how to hide the voice in my head
Meet me on the road, tell me all you know
I'm here on my own

Take me on a ride
Show me how to hide the voice in my head
You've got away with my anxiety
It's yours to take back

You've got away with my anxiety
It's yours to take back

Take me on a ride
Show me how to hide the voice in my head
Meet me on the road, tell me all you know
I'm here on my own

Take me on a ride
Show me how to hide the voice in my head
You've got away with my anxiety
It's yours to take back
