Two mainstream die
You don't love me when I cry
have to say goodbye
I don't want to say goodbye
Baby goodbye

and Mister I
I got funky blues
all over me
such tender persuasion

I want, I want to die
You don't love me when I cry
Made me love to play
Made me promise I would stay
then you stayed away

Mister I
I got drawn blind blues
all over me
Rubies and smoke rings
no no No you NO NO NO

I will go
I will stay
in the hours of my crying day
in the hours of my crying day
in the hours of my crying day
in the hours of my crying day, ah hey
in the hours of my crying a day, uh hey hey
