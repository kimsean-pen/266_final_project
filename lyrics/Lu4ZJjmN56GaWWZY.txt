You don't have a clue
What it is like
To be next to you.

I'm here to tell you
That it is good
That it is true.

Birds singing a song
Old paint is peeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling.
Words can't be that strong
My heart is reeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling.

Try, try to forget
What's in the past
Tomorrow is here.

Love, orange sky above
Lighting your way
There's nothing to fear.

Birds singing a song
Old paint is peeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling.
Words can't be that strong
My heart is reeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling.

Some people are good
Babe in the hood
So pure and so free.

I make a safe bet
You're gonna get
Whatever you need.

Birds singing a song
Old paint is peeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling.
Words can't be that strong
My heart is reeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling.
That fresh feeling.
This is that fresh feeling
