Will we find a solution when we add all the numbers?
Like they are supposed to be?
But no one is close... start all over
If we fail our expectations
We fall into the deepest void
Is there no limit to how many times we will dust ourselves off?
What does it take for sanity to reamin?
Dismiss the cynics... maybe...

The mystery of time
Listen to me carefully
The mystery of time
It's you and me
That's all we need

Would you choose supremacy if it led to isolation?
Could you handle the solitude?
Would you still prefer the throne?

The mystery of time
Listen to me carefully
The mystery of time
It's you and me
That's all we need

The mystery of time
Listen to me carefully

The mystery of time!
Listen to me, carefully!
