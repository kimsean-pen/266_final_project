Remember how you used to ummm,
You used to phone up and (oohhh)
You just say hey you.You know, I
See you on my blank sheet before I
Write or form oracle this situation yo,
My memories choke me and stain my
Pillow as my voice become hollow as
I trace tear lines around this space
That won't fill yo I feel nothing but
This way and the emptiness stays
And its cluttered witha silence that
Teases me it leads me on like it's
Gonna say, like it's gonna say...

(Chorus:)
Hey you, I'm Sorry that I have to leave
I'll try to come back oohhh.
Hey you I'm sorry that I have to leave
I'll try to come back one day.

You know yesterday I stood outside
In the rain in an attempt to dissolve
Away or just disappear or be gone be
Back or be just. I try to see the point
But I only see the pain. My dreams cry
When they're slain I regain consciousness
To blurry vision I try to listen out for whispers of...

(Chorus:)
Hey you, I'm sorry that I have to leave
I'll try to come back
oohhh.
Hey you, I'm sorry that I have to leave
I'll try to comeback one day.

Rain drops disguise my tears have gone.
I want you to be here with me to stand by me.
See I can't help to be selfish baby
'Cause I don't want to be alone.

(Chorus:)
Hey you, I'm sorry that I have to leave.
I'll try to come back, oohhh.
Hey you, I'm sorry that I have to leave.
I'll try to come back one day.

Did I leave you behind or did you let me go?
All I know is you're not here to say to me
Those special words. (Hey You) Time was
Once on our side but now it's against us.
It parts us and we're not always (saints?)

(Chorus:)
Hey you, I'm sorry that I have ot leave.
I'll try to come back oohhh.
Hey You, I'm sorry that I have to leave.
I'll try to back one day.
