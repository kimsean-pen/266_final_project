And you take me over
over again
And you take me over
over again
Wonder how can i go on and on
when you want to bury my passion
you are the shell around
and i cannot escape
and i swallow my pride
Entwined together now
it's time to pass it over
(and you take me over, over again)
entwined together now
(and you take me over, over again)
entwined forever
Wonder how can i live on and on
when you want to live in a hurry
you are the wall that i,
that i have to remove
and i swallow
i swallow my pride
Entwined together now
it's time to pass it over
entwined together now
entwined forever
And you take me over
over again
and you take me over
over again
and you take me over
over again
and you take me over
over again
Entwined together now
it's time to pass it over
(and you take me over, over again)
entwined together now
(and you take me over, over again)
entwined forever
