There's gold in the city
But never quite enough like to pay the rent
You could've had it all
But the pity and everything you're gonna need is heaven sent

Maybe the dream that we had is gone
The people 'round here are like a setting sun
They're pickin' you up
When they're knocking you down
But they can't stop me from loving you

Do you want a butterfly
The deals doesn't let it by
You do the damage kid
If love's what it's all about
It's all I can show you now
You do the damage kid

Like a stone I was falling
Would anybody come and get me out of here
I waited in the rain for the calling
Would anybody come and get me out of here

Maybe the dream that we had is gone
The people 'round here are like a setting sun
They're pickin' you up
When they're knocking you down
But they can't stop me from loving you

Do you want a butterfly
The deals doesn't let it by
You do the damage kid
If love's what it's all about
It's all I can show you now
You do the damage kid
Be my butterfly
Please don't forget about it
You do the damage kid
If love's what it's all about
It's all I can show you now
You do the damage kid
