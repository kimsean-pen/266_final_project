As the days go by
The apple of my eye
I'll always wait for you

And as a new day dawns
The darkness moves away
And I will wait for you

Remember, remember
The face of you
Surrender, surrender
The touch of you

Well it's hard to hold
The room is turning cold
The candle flickers still

And what I would not do
For the love of you
Would you hold on to me?

Remember, remember
The face of you
Surrender, surrender
The touch of you

As the days the go by
The apple of my eye
I'll always wait for you

And as a new day dawns
The darkness moves away
And I will wait for you

Remember, remember
The face of you
Surrender, surrender
The touch of you

I will remember, I will remember the face of you
I will remember, I will remember the touch of you
I will remember, I will remember the face of you
I will remember, I will remember the touch of you
