Mental vigour's been right on the egde
To a stupefying hole of no return
Now we dance a holy war is won
But there must be more we got to learn

Don't you know that I'm here I must go
Into the morning light, illuminate the night
Be the guide on our side, the Gnosis

No return, I will go, follow the call of my spirit
No return, I must know all that I never could ask
No return

No I still can't leave the world in here
Soon I feel that I am gonna get her free
But I've smelled at and I long for more
Take me in, oh I beg, philosophy

Oh I got to know, more now so I must go on
Into the morning light, illuminate the night
Be the guide on our side, the Gnosis

No return, I will go, follow the call of my spirit
No return, I must know all that I never could ask
No return

No return, maybe you must pay
Many've been in quest for truth
Insanity has swallowed away
No return, but I wish you all the best
Go and face the tree of knowledge and be free

No return, I will go, follow the call of my spirit
No return, I must know all that I never could ask
