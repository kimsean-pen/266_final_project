I was on 45th
I was half out of the bag
Yeah, I knew that you saw me
You laughed when I looked back

I thought I'd given up, that didn't feel so bad
And then a shot went through me
And then I walked right back

Do you wanna get understood?
Do you want one thing, or are you looking for savior?
Do you run when it's just getting good?
Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you?

Someone get popsicles
Someone do something 'bout this heat
'Cause it's late in October
I tossed him out in the street
You tiptoe for ages, but lose yourself
Flipping back pages, unbuckling belts

Ah, love
That's the way love comes
Do you? Don't you know that's the way love comes
Do you feel it black and blue?
Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you?
