You've got this subtle kind of way of making everything turn grey
Like a bottle that runs dry before you've even had a drink
Do you think what you do just might fix the bad in you?
Well, you're wrong this time around

And oh, oh, oh, oh, you know you gave me something to believe in
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you hide behind these battle lines

I'm gonna be a comeback kid & I want to find the words I need to say
Yeah, I'm gonna survive with my head held high & finally walk away
I'm gonna be a comeback kid & I want to be the one that's not afraid
To jump from every sinking ship 'cause I'm done waiting to be saved
I'm done waitin'

You've got this subtle kind of way about you that pulls me under but I won't drown
It's gonna take a whole lot more than that to ever bring me down
I promise that I'll be back & I'll be better than before
What you broke down I'll build back up, 'cause I don't need you anymore

And oh, oh, oh, oh, you know you gave me something to believe in
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you hide behind these battle lines

And oh, oh, oh, oh, you know you gave me something to believe in
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you hide behind these battle lines

I'm gonna be a comeback kid & I want to find the words I need to say
Yeah, I'm gonna survive with my head held high & finally walk away
I'm gonna be a comeback kid & I want to be the one that's not afraid
To jump from every sinking ship 'cause I'm done waiting to be saved

Do you think what you do just might fix the bad in you?
Well, you're wrong this time around

And oh, oh, oh, oh, you know you gave me something to believe in
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you hide behind these battle lines

I'm gonna be a comeback kid & I want to find the words I need to say
Yeah, I'm gonna survive with my head held high & finally walk away
I'm gonna be a comeback kid & I want to be the one that's not afraid
To jump from every sinking ship 'cause I'm done waiting to be saved
I'm done waitin' (to be saved)
