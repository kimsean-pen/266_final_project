Minds of men fashioned
This crate of thunder
Sent it high into the blue

Hands of men will blast
This world asunder
As we will swoop upon you

Souls of men dreaming of skies
To conquer
Gave us wings, ever to soar

So of we go into the wild Blue Yonder
To heavens very door
Fliegen Wie Vögel - Vögeln Wie Flieger

Climbing high into the clouds above us
In bombers named for girls
To drink the air, breathe the light
And guard our lovers
Into the sun we swirl

And far below, rivals wait and peer
For what our coming brings

We dare assault the sky
And we fill their hearts with fear
For death is in our wings
Fliegen Wie Vögel - Vögeln Wie Flieger

We cut up the winds, envy no man below
For down we dive, spouting flame
And up between Gods
Billowed legs we roll
To feel the lust swell within

With gleaming blades slicing up the sun
We wheel and we glide
Dancing with clouds, aloft we spin
Into the warmth inside
Fliegen Wie Vögel - Vögeln Wie Flieger

My love, better get on your knees
And care and pray for each and every one

When you hear us pass in
Our delicate beasts
Steel your heart and say
'Your Will Be Done.'
