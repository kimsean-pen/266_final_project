When you're wakin' in the mourning,
What do you hear? What do you hear?
When you're lookin' in the mirror,
Who do you fear? Who do you fear?
No, don't walk away from talkin', falling behind inside.

When you listen to their echo,
Who do you hear? Who do you hear?
When you're playin' in their playground,
What do you fear? What do you fear?
No, it's only yourself you're marking, finding the truth inside.

One, two, three, four, get your feet on the floor.
Everybody feel it down to the core.
Alright, alright, yeah I've heard it before.
Give into the sweet temptation!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lies inside the hollow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You don't have to...

Follow, follow, follow, follow.

Look into the television, starin' at me, starin' at me.
Maybe it's my conscience calling, what does it mean? Who should I be?
No, it's only yourself you're marking, finding the truth inside.

One, two, three, four, get your feet on the floor.
Everybody feel it down to the core.
Alright, alright, yeah I've heard it before.
Give into the sweet temptation!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lies inside the hollow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You don't have to...

Follow... follow... follow... follow...
Follow... follow... follow... follow...

One... two... three... four...
One... two... three... four...
One... two... three...

One, two, three, four, get your feet on the floor.
Everybody feel it down to the core.
Alright, alright, yeah I've heard it before.
Give into the sweet temptation!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lies inside the hollow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You don't have to...

One, two, three, four, get your feet on the floor.
Lies inside the hollow...
Alright, alright, yeah I've heard it before.
Give into the sweet temptation!
