Some nights I drink way too much and I smoke just to feel like I'm in a vibe
Some nights I kill myself just so I can feel like I'm so alive
Just so I can feel like I'm in a moment with you
And I wake up and do it all again I'm forgetful

Some nights
Some nights I drink way too much and I smoke just to feel like I'm in a vibe
Some nights I kill myself just so I can feel like I'm too alive
Just so I can feel like I'm in a moment with you
And I wake up and do it all again I'm forgetful

Who the fuck needs trophies
Money feed the kids n*gga gimme that
I'm not a shooter but I promise I know just how that semi acts
Baby boy, Gucci sneaks and I need my Similac
That steak is medium rare not rare send it back, send it back
Friction got us going our separate ways
I promised her forever starting tomorrow knowing that she'd never wait
So if I'm wrong now say that I'm wrong
Let me know
Some nights

Losing your mind the whole time
If you're all mine
Then say you're all mine
We've both been blurring the lines, we're so blind
I say we're both trying, you say there's no time
I give you my all so ain't nothing fucking left
You told me you're leaving, I told you I ain't gone cry so I never wept
And I gamble with my life so tonight I'm making heavy bets
