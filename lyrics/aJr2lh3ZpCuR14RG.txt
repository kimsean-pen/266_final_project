Help me if you can
It's just that this,
this is not the way I'm wired, So

could you please
Help me understand why
You've given in to all these

Reckless dark desires, You're
lying to yourself again
Suicidal imbecile
Think about it,
you're pounding on the fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you precious

I'm over this. Why do you wanna throw it away like this?
Such a mess.
Why would I want to watch you

Disconnect and self destruct one bullet at a time?
What's your rush now,

everyone will have his day to die
Medicated,
drama queen,
picture perfect, numb belligerence
Narcissistic,
drama queen,

craving fame
and all its decadence
Lying through your teeth again

Suicidal imbecile
Think about it,

you're pounding on the fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you precious
Go with this, why do you wanna throw it away like this
Such a mess.
Why would I wanna watch you...
Disconnect and self destruct one bullet at a time?

What's your rush now,
everyone will have his day to die
They were right about you
They were right about you
Lying to my face again
Suicidal imbecile
Think about,
you're pounding on the fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you precious
I'm over this. Why do you wanna throw it away like this
Such a mess,
over this,
over this!
Disconnect and self destruct, one bullet at a time
What's your hurry, everyone will have his day to die
If you choose to pull the trigger, should your drama prove sincere
Do it somewhere far away from here
