Mid air
I woke up beneath the flight deck
On the wall paper airplane
As you stared
I strap my helmet on and left your driveway behind

Flutter all through the night
And we can blow the clouds around
This paper hanger skyline
Summer smile again
And you can disappear
But I'd rather be here

Dive bomb
We descended down the stair case
And crashed to the kitchen floor
And so long
Our flight of downy dreams
Preened our soft paper wings

Flutter all through the night
And we can blow the clouds around
This paper hanger skyline
Summer smile again
And you can disappear
But I'd rather be here

Hello down there
The mooring made of singers
In the air
Keeping the midnight stars
Held high
We are captains of the sky
Waving goodbye

Hello down there
The mooring made of singers
In the air
Keeping the midnight stars
Held high
We are captains of the sky
Waving goodbye

Hello down there
The mooring made of singers
In the air
Keeping the midnight stars
Held high
We are captains of the sky
Waving goodbye goodbye goodbye ...
