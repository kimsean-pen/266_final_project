So, what am I?

A bad case of reverse schizophrenia
the imaginary friend of everyone else
a soulless terrorist with
a message to spread
with the worst upbringing possible
and no emotions

I want others to hit rock bottom as well

Get in touch with their
inhuman instincts
and do hard drugs,
be a free spirit
become enlightened,
become criminally insane
You need me,
and I need you to be like me

We're the scum of the earth
with nothing to lose
