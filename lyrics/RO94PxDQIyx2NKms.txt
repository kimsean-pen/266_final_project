I'm dreaming about tomorrow
I'm thinking of yesterday
I consume myself in sorrow
This moment in time is what I betray

But I am searching for the answers
And I look around
Sometimes I get sad
Because I don't know which way to go

And I look around
Sometimes I get sad
Because my life is spinning is out of control

I never know what you want
I never know what you need

It was difference from the start
When you cut me in two, I never thought I would bleed

But I am searching for the answers
And I look around
Sometimes I get sad
Because I don't know which way to go

And I look around
Sometimes I get sad
Because my life is spinning is out of control

I will call this alone
I don't need nobody's help
I've got to do this myself
Alone alone alone

And I look around
sometimes I get sad
Because I don't know which way to go

And I look around
Sometimes I get sad
Because my life is spinning is out of control

And I look around
sometimes I get sad
Because I don't know which way to go

And I look around
Sometimes I get sad
Because my life is spinning is out of control
