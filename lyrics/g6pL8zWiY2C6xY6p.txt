What on earth am I meant to do?
In this crowded place there is only you
Was gonna leave now I have to stay
You have taken my breath away, ooh

Is the world still spinning around? (Spinning around) Ooh
I don't feel like coming down

It's in your eyes, I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise, I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you

Destiny has a funny way
When it comes and takes all your cares away
I can't think of a single thing
Other than what a beautiful state I'm in, ooh

Is the world still spinning around? (Spinning around) Ooh
I don't feel like coming down

It's in your eyes, I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise, I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you (with you...)

Want to make it with you (with you...)

Ooh
Is the world still spinning around? (Spinning around) Ooh
I don't feel like coming down

It's in your eyes, I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise, I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you
It's in your eyes, I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise, I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you
It's in your eyes, I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise, I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you
It's in your eyes
