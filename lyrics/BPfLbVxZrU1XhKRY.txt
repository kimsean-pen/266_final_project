Like his dad you know that he's had
Animal nitrate in mind
Oh in your council home he jumped on your bones
Now you're taking it time after time

Oh it turns you on, on
Now he has gone

Oh what turns you on, on
Now your animal's gone

Well he said he'd show you his bed
And the delights of the chemical smile

So in your broken home he broke all your bones
And now you're taking it time after time
Oh it turns you on, on
Now he has gone
Oh what turns you on, on
Now your animal's gone

What does it take to turn you on, on
Now he has gone
Now you're over 21
Now your animal's gone
Animal, he was animal, an animal
Animal, he was animal, an animal
Animal... animal
He just an animal, an aminal
Animal, he was animal, he just an aminal
