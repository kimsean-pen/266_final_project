Do you feel left behind?
Like there's something not right?
I don't think I've been connected
But of all the dead volcanos on Earth you just happened to retch
And roll
Through mine

There were fistfuls of hair 'round the foot of my chair
And acres of screens before me
But breathing out I swear you were real

You were there
You were there
You were there
For a while

But I don't know what's real and what's going on
And I don't wanna be here when the sky is gone
(I just can't keep up with it, I)
I don't wanna think about it all, I'm tired
(Nothing's good, there's something more)
I don't wanna think about it all, I'm tired

It was sold with a wink
It was slipped in my drink
A necropolis for the taking
But all the cities flow into one and there's nothing but knives
and fears
and forks

Seems the more I find out, the more I'm sure of it girl
And baby I get the feeling, there's somewhere darkened over it
And it's here (I feel it coming, one, one step from nothin')
And it's here (I feel it coming, one, one step from nothin')
And it's here for a while (I feel it coming, one, one step from nothin')
(I-I, I-I)

But I don't know what's real and what's going on
And I don't wanna be here when the sky is gone
(I just can't keep up with it, I)
I don't wanna think about it all, I'm tired
(Nothing's good, there's something more)
I don't wanna think about it all, I'm tired

But I can hear them plundering the streets at night
You never should have told them what you have inside
And I don't want my children in an endless race
And I don't wanna wait to see what else they take
(Sulphur howling over you and)
And all that matters now is that we don't let go
(Black caldera ash and falling)
And you can be my wonder in my time of woe
(Tarred and feathered genii)
If it's gonna happen let it happen now
(Acid in the tears alone)
If it's gonna happen let it happen now!
