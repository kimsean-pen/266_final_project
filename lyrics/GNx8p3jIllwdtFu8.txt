I had it with the same old routine
I had it with the same old faces, places
Everynight, in my life
I started feeling washed up, washed out
Hung up, wrung out, left to dry out
Everynight
But I know
Yeah, I know you're out there, somewhere
Oh, I, I can almost hear you callin'
I'm Looking For A Stranger in the night
I need a little danger in my life, tonight

I'm tired of the same old -
Hello baby, how ya doun'? Come here often?"
Where have you been all my life?"
Everynight

But I know
That someday, somewhere
I'll turn around and you'll be there
Ooo., In my life
Everynight

But I know
Yeah, I know you're out there, somewhere
Oh, I, I can almost hear you callin'
I'm Looking For A Stranger in the night
I need a little danger in my life, tonight

I'm Looking For A Stranger in the night
I need a little danger in my life, tonight
