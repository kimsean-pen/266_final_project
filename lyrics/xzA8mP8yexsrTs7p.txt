Animosities and apologies
Back and forth we
Struggle, falter, refrain

With glue and string
And deciphering we try,
Try, try to stay together
Despite the pain

It's not our first time
Through nor our waterloo
Back and forth from situation
We move to episode

But if we can find
Some piece of mind
Intertwined the delivery
Is worth the load
