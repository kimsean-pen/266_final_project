I wrote it off before the story began and it came down to this, I can't pretend
You've been reckless, and lately I can tell by your front
You've misled me before, now I know what you want

I've seen versions of you, they're becoming impossible to follow (well, you're something else)
Wasted arrows
Two worlds drawn apart; Was it desperation that pushed you over? (I can see you're not lucking out, man)
Wasted arrows

Prey on the weakness

You put out the bait you'd try anything
I resented you 'cause you left me out to dry
