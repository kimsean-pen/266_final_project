*Chorus*
I gotta get away sometimes(get away, get away)
I got to get away
I gotta slip away sometimes(get away, get away)
I got to slip away to my special place

*Verse 1*
I woke up yeah on a cloudy day
I'm feeling blase blase from last nights party
And in the back of my mind I got work today
I couldn't find my shoes to lardy dardy

*Bridge*
Excuse me sir, me car broke down
Me Mrs left me with the baby now
And I can't make that date today
It might have to be another day
I said I'm sorry
I said I'm sorry
Oh yeah

*Chorus*

*Repeat Verse 1*

*Repeat Bridge*

*Chorus*

Got to get away
Got to slip away
Got to get away
Got to slip away
Got to slip away to me own reality...

*Chorus to fade*
