Lunar sea

For the Lunar sea see the river moon
And you got it
Match the finest words to the greatest tune
And you bought it
See me cross in style
Walk the longest mile in a minute
Where do drifters go?
Wonder if they know there's no limit
At the rainbows end
Find a perfect friend say you're sorry
Make me dream at night
Break my heart on sight don't you worry
Swept the sounds of love from the skies above
And I knew it
Swim the seas of blue just to drown in you
And I blew it

You hear it, the shiver in spine don't come near it
I love it, you soar and you cry rise above it
Got my lunar sea for you're river moon
If you let it
Match my finest words to your greatest tune
Won't forget it

You hear it, the shiver in spine don't come near it
I love it, you soar and you cry rise above it
Fly by lunar sea lullaby
