Got, got, got, got, got
He got, he got, he got, he got

La la la la la la la, look at your hands, your hands
Look, la la, look at your hands, your hands
Look at all the objects in your hands, your hands
La la, look at your hands, your

La la la la la la la, look at your hands, your hands
Look, la la, look at your hands, your hands
Turning objects over in your hands, your hands
La la, look at your hands, your hands

La la la la la la, look at my hands, my plan
Shoot, I should've faced that, placed that
Tell me my own father is a wicked man
Now now now now now now now
Now it's my hands, my hands

How much would it cost to make it my plan, my man
Ooh, I wanna taste that, waste that
Sell me my own water off of my own land
Now now now now now now now
Now it's my hands, my hands

La la la la la la la, look at your hands, your hands
Look, la la, look at your hands, your hands
Look at all the objects in your hands, your hands
La la, look at your hands, yours

He got, he got the shadow to follow the foe
He got, got that thing to go
La-la-locked and loaded and ready to go
He got lots of things to go, oh
He got the shadow to follow the foe
He got, got that thing to go
La-la-locked and loaded and ready to go
He got lots of things to go
He got the shadow to follow the foe
He got, got that thing to go
La-la-locked and loaded and ready to go

Got, got, got, got, got, got
He got, he got, he got, he got, he got, he got
He got, he go-got, he got

He got the shadow to follow the foe
He got, got that thing to go
La-la-locked and loaded and ready to go
He got lots of things to go

Harmony, harmony
Vibration when voices are free
Harmony, harmony
How I long to see

How much would it cost to make it my plan, my man
Ooh, I wanna taste that, waste that
Tell me my own father is a wicked man
Now it's my hands, my hands

La la la la la la la, look at your hands, your hands
Look, la la, look at your hands, your hands
Look at all the objects in your hands, your hands
La la, look at your hands, your hands
