Welcome to obsession
It makes the world go round
We're made up by the people we surround
(So!)
We live and die for shit we don't need
Well maybe that's the price of envy
Through these eyes I look out for me
But everyone fades in ways we don't see
Nothing's gonna change
(Why!)
We're going down in flames
(So!)
I'm not the one

Don't wait for me
Cause I won't just sit by
While you just bleed
Myself and others dry
Don't wait for me
To be there in the end
When you don't see
The truth you just pretend
Don't wait for me

What is the solution
We don't already know
There's no telling how far this could go
(No!)
You do your time punch in it's the same
Cause you're just part of this game
There's nothing you could do to save yourself
You leave your life in the hands of someone else
They'll never let it go
(Why!)
It's the only way you know
(Know!)
I'm not the one

Don't wait for me
Cause I won't just sit by
While you just bleed
Myself and others dry
Don't wait for me
To be there in the end
When you don't see
The truth you just pretend
Don't wait for me

When did we begin
To let ourselves give in
How'd it come to this
Miserable bliss

Just take the rest of
Just take the best of me
Just take the rest of
Just take the best of me
You take the rest of me
Just take the best of me
You take the rest of me
Just take the best

Don't wait for me
Cause I won't just sit by
While you just bleed
Myself and others dry
Don't wait for me
To be there in the end
When you don't see
The truth you just pretend
Don't wait for me
