The quickening
Is an ephemeral thing
That only happens in the dark
Like catching lightning in a jar
And the pain that it brings
Is just the promise of Spring
It's madness on the wing
Oh, what does it mean

To come alive
To come alive
To come alive
(To come alive) To come alive
To come alive
To come alive

The entering is soulful conjecturing
Oh, lost and by the wind grieved ghost
Please come back to me again
Because the way that she bleeds
Is in the law that he reads
Confusing words and deeds
So what does it mean

To come alive
To come alive
To come alive
(To come alive) To come alive
To come alive
To come alive

To pierce the vein of the sacred and profane
Poor science in the service of the faith
But who will bear the mark of Cain?

To come alive
To come alive
To come alive
To come alive
To come alive
To come alive
To come alive
To come alive
To come alive
To come alive
To come alive
To come alive
