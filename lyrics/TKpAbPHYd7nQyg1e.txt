Sometimes I feel I'm gonna break down and cry (so lonely)
Nowhere to go, nothing to do with my time
I get lonely, so lonely
Living on my own

Sometimes I feel I'm always walking too fast (Too lonely)
And everything is coming down on me, down on me
I go crazy, oh, so crazy
Living on my own

Dee do de de
Dee do de de
I don't have no time for no monkey business
Dee do de de
Dee do de de
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
Got to be some good times ahead

Sometimes I feel nobody gives me no warning
Find my head is always up in the clouds in a dreamworld
It's not easy
Living on my own (My own, my own)

Dee do de de (lonely)
Dee do de de (lonely)
I don't have no time for no monkey business
Dee do de de
Dee do de de
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
Got to be some good times ahead

Dee do de de
Dee do de de
I don't have no time for no monkey business
Dee do de de
Dee do de de
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
Got to be some good times ahead
