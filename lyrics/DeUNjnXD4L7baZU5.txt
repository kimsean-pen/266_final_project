Life is hard
And so am I
You'd better give me
Something so I don't die

Novocaine for the soul
Before I sputter out

Life is white
And I am black
Jesus and His lawyer
Are coming back

Oh, my darling will you be here?
Before I sputter out

Guess, who's living here
With the great undead
This paint by numbers life
Is fucking with my head, once again

Life is good
And I feel great
'Cause mother says I was
A great mistake
Novocaine for the soul
You'd better give me
Something to fill the hole
Before I sputter out
