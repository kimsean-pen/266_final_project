Go to now after picking the glass off the ground.
Go to now after shaking the thing for a sound.
Do we see what the clock makes you do?
But I won't let this happen to you.

In a town where I lost every shirt on the fence.
Go to now, I am bleeding a trail through the lens.
When I see what I now know is you, I was caught in the eye as you came.
Pulled by my name, I'm fallin' through.

Traveling at godspeed over the hills and trails.
I have refused my call pushin' my lazy cells.
Into the blue flame, I want to crash here right now.
The hourglass spills its sand, if only to punish you.

For listenin' too long to one song.
Listenin' too long to one song.
Sing me Spanish techno.
Listenin' too long to one song.
Listenin' too long to one song.
Sing me Spanish techno.

Go to now after wiring the thing to explode.
Wired for sound, wide awake here for days in a row.
Now we see what the engine can do, and I won't let this happen to you.
I won't let this happen to you.

Traveling at godspeed over the hills and trails.
I have refused my call pushin' my lazy cells.
Into the blue flame, I want to crash here right now.
The hourglass spills its sand, if only to punish you.

For listenin' too long to one song.
Listenin' too long to one song.
Sing me Spanish techno.
Listenin' too long to one song.
Listenin' too long to one song.
Sing me Spanish techno.
