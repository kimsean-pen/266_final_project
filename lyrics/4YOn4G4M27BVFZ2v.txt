To the sweet bone-shattering music
Of physics unraveling
Black holes convolve
A messenger is traveling

It will start on the astral plane
Tongues of spiders whisper
Songs of outer frost
Tongues of madness twist the
Fabric of the brain
Tongues of turmoil rip the
Fabric of the world

Azagthoth
Exploding vacuum
Teeth of the maelstrom
Absolute and final
Eversion of the cosmos
The discontinuum unfurls
The gorge of Azagthoth
Forever ravenous

Azagthoth
Nuclei rumble
Azagthoth
From void emerge
Azagthoth
Paradigms tumble
Azagthoth
And parallels merge

What words can convey
The absurdity of living inside
The blade abyss we call our universe
Who are we in the light of such dimensions
Who am I to even begin to tell the tale

We are taught to rise and conquer what we see
The biosphere devours itself to stay alive
When the worms are done with what is left of us
And the atoms have regained their memory at last

The great beast that contains all matter awakens
Just to find itself engulfed
Wrapped up in a singularity
Choking in the vastness of Azagthoth

Rolling through chasms of unspeakability
Maws the size of galaxies revolve
Scourge the antisphere of space-time
Returning all to Azagthoth

Exploding vacuum
Teeth of the maelstrom
Absolute and final
Eversion of the cosmos
The discontiuum unfurls
The gorge of Azagthoth
Forever ravenous

Solo â€“ Christian

A boil of seething, writhing flesh
Inseminates the sky
Inflates grotesquely
Fills the firmament
Tears through the horizon
Azagthoth
The noosphere burst
Rasps a final breath
Azagthoth
Fucks the universe to death

Azagthoth
Exploding vacuum
Teeth of the maelstrom
Absolute and final
Eversion of the cosmos
Azagthoth
