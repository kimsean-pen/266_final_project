Baby exchanging for no use
I need to
Come right back and be alone again
Baby i didn't need the use
Out of him
Didn't come with no set or warranty
1 there's no one
That i adore more
Than your love
It hurts me more
To let you have
In again
There's no one
Who could ever show me love
Wait 'til never
Trust someone
Better than you
2 should i take him back
After what he did
Hurt me in ways
That i can't begin to
Replace how i feel
So i'll just go away
Take him back
After what he did
Hurt me in ways
That i can't begin to
Replace how i feel
So i'll just go away
Don't wanna go through the same game
Again
He's no good
And that's just it for me
Does it everytime he returns
There's no use
I'll just be the one left in the end
Repeat 1
Repeat 2 (2x)
Don't wanna go through the same thing
Many of it remains
Don't wanna go through the same games
Repeat 2
Take him back
There's no one i adore
And you know it hurts me more
To let you back into my life
You ain't never treat me right
There's no one i adore
And you know it hurts me more
To let you back into my life
You ain't never treat me right
Repeat 2
