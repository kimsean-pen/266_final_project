I have a secret.
Can you keep it?
It involves spilling blood, and your waste, don't mistake my intention.
It's not sin, or a murder for carnal disgrace.
That would be unlawful, and sloth filled.
There's a purpose right now, why you're facing the ground.
Who wants to, see this?
First-hand what I'm talking about while your family screams...

Come in close, my grip it holds you, feel the rush of my boiling veins.
Impact of the energy growing,
React to you enemy slowing, pushing forward to the things that make you scream.

I have a motive, a focus,
I won't repent fro regret as I choke you to death, and my choice is.
These voices.
Won't get out of my head, as you panic you're breathing harder, on me.
Now do you perceive and believe you're becoming my victim.
So listen, you're screaming so loud that I can't even hear myself think.

Come in close, my grip it holds you, feel the rush of my boiling veins.
Impact of the energy growing,
React to you enemy slowing, pushing forward to the things that make you scream.

I swear to God I'll never do it again.
I swear to God I'm gonna do it again.
(SCREAM)
I swear to God I'll never do it again.
(SCREAM)
I swear to God I'm gonna do it again.
(SCREAM)
I swear to God I'll never do it again.
(SCREAM)

Locked in this cell, awaiting my hell, I feel it rushing into my veins.
Impact of the energy growing.
React to you enemy slowing, pushing forward to the things that make you scream.
Impact of the energy growing.
React to your enemy slowing, pushing forward to the things that make scream.
