3AM on a Monday, rolling strong
The world gets crazy hazy when you've been on it too long
Rolling in this big ass van
Trying to get some more beats blasting

'Cause all we want is a Friday night
That will treat us right
And if we don't feel like we've got it right
There's always next weekend

There's no giving up, no going home
We'll be here till the end, we're pressing on
Probably should've asked a friend
But that's no how we're living
We're still rolling strong
At least we're living
We're still rolling on

4AM on a Thursday, I need sleep
Been pulling these all nighters all damn week
Rolling in this big ass van
Trying to get some more beats blasting

'Cause all we want is a Friday night
That will treat us right
And if we don't feel like we've got it right
There's always next weekend
All we need is a place to crash
In a big ass bed with a little cash
And the vibe's just right
It makes me happy
I'm so happy
