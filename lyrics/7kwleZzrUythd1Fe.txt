You've been walking while I'm sleeping
I've been thinking about leaving
Better put my money on it
I put my money on it

I know you're sober but I can't be
Why can't anything be easy
Better put my money on it
I put my money on you

We can talk until we talk it out
We can work until baby, until we work it out

I've been drinking in the evening
Because our bedroom has been freezing
Better put my money on it
I put my money on it

You've been laughing while I'm speaking
I've been trying to get even
I put my money on it
I put my money on you

We can talk until we talk it out
Or we can work until baby, until we work it out

When we talk it's always screaming
We can wait until we're bleeding
When we talk it's always screaming
We can wait until we're bleeding

It's always screaming, until we're bleeding

We can talk until we talk it out
Ot we can work until baby, until we work it out
