If you want it
And you're going out of your mind
If you want me in your bed
We better do it on the sly

One song for you
We wrote a little tune
It takes off for you
Hold on, hold on, it's coming soon

If you feel it in your body like a hurricane
Let your arms become propellers
Take off, don't feel any shame

I know for you, it don't make sense
I don't make sense
Nothing comes true
Because the doors were locked for you

Got a message
Spelled out in a lovesick bruise
I got this secret code that
Only flame holders know how to use

Piled up for you
The notes I wrote on hollow walls
Let me come through
Pass through the things that we went through

Jump in, jump out
Get in, get out
Jump in, jump out
Get in, get out

Have memory of the things we said
Take memory of the things you left
Have memory of the things we said
Take memory of the things you left

Drop little boy crumbs, you could follow back
When you get lost becoming a man
Drop little boy crumbs, you could follow back
When you get lost becoming a man

It's a lie, it's a truth
You need it more than I do
I want it all for you
But I can't live for you
