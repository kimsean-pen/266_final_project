20's on my whip like my name was Dwayne Carter
Fuck this bitch once then she turned into a stalker
It's the doped up zombie
Looking like a walker
Rolling with Mary Jane like my name was Peter Parker
$uicide for life
Oddy on my right
Haters never on my left because they are never in my sight
Tony with the Tommy
Sloth on the Slick
I understand the hate because I probably fucked your bitch
One gold tooth and not a dollar to my name
Killers for the pain and a gram of cocaine
I'm screaming fuck the world
They screaming fuck my girl
Little white cracker smoking pills up out the foil
Yea you know how it goes
$uicide flow
Always down to roll, sipping barre real slow
Swerving down the road
With no place to go
Got a lot of drugs, bring it back to '04
X2
It's that suicidal 7th Ward soulja
Bitch I just sit back and watch
I'm that shoulder-shrugging cobra
Riding on spares in my broken down Testa Rossa
Posted down in that dirty south
Bitch, I'm barely bipolar
I'm a polar bear
Ruby da Cherry sending solar flares
Slickity Sloth is over there by the fire pit trying to get the fire lit
But, me, I like it cold
The hoe-fucking-blizzard-loving
Opposite of a desert lizard
I'm fucking buzzing like a mobile phone being ignored
Leave me the fuck alone I'm fucking froze
I don't know who told you what
This blunt ain't for sharing, bitch
Ima smoke it on my own
I'm done with you fucking clones, hoe
