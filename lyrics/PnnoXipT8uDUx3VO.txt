Last night, I was thinking
about the times when I was weak in
When I and they take advantages
Goes with the times
Goes with the times

(ahaaha ahaaha)
(ahaaha ahaaha)
(ahaaha ahaaha)

This moment I was remembring
About the times when I became
More struggling
And when I decided I was stronger
And how you make me feel
Those times away
I used to lose my self, so I can find you quicker
I used to lose my self, so I can hug bigger
(ahaaha ahaaha)
(ahaaha ahaaha)
(ahaaha ahaaha)

I used to lose my self, so I can find you quicker
I used to lose my self, so I can hug bigger
I used to lose my self, so I can find you quicker
I used to lose my self, so I can hug bigger
