Eyes wide
The air's thin
Can't hold
Fear within

My lust for blood is strong
Can't pierce my iron lung

Dense fog
I can't see
Which form
You will be

I'm just a wandering soul
You will have no control

This night terror lives inside my mind
Through fog and smoke, this one's hard to find
Don't wake me up, the demon's not a lie
I won't back down, fight until I die

Fists clenched
Muscles tense
Weakness
I can't sense

Why do you choose to fight
So far from Heaven's light

You're close
Attack me
Don't stop
I won't flee

How dare you defy me
My hands will make you bleed

This night terror lives inside my mind
Through fog and smoke, this one's hard to find
Don't wake me up, the demon's not a lie
I won't back down, fight until I die
