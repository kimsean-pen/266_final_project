It's a tall order
A wall across my border
For a lost cause
Keeping peace and order
Better disguise
A cost I can't afford

I had my eyes opened
Sharpened all my senses
Then saw warnings
Lowered my defenses
It cannot last
It's different from us

I'm scarred
I must protect myself
I must maintain my ...
I'm scarred

So here's a rare confection
To add to your collection
Using sweet starch
Then you're not free
To take a piece of me

I'm not candy you can sample and discard
You barely scratched my surface, and I'm scarred
It's just too hard
I'm not candy you can sample and discard
You barely scratched my surface, and I'm scarred
It's just too hard

I must protect myself
I must stay undone
I'm scarred
I must protect myself
I must stay undone
I'm scarred
I must protect myself
I must maintain my...
I'm scarred
I'm scarred
I'm scarred
I'm scarred
