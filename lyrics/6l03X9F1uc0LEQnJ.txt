I know you don't believe that it's over like that
You know you still love me and I love you too
You know this ain't gon' be our last kiss
Nah, I know you don't believe that it's over like that

Feels so empty inside since our last kiss goodbye
Picture you in my mind and I can't seem to rationalize
They way we let it in, it just don't make no sense
This can't be happening, I need you back again

Everybody asking questions like with some kind of obsession
For the millionth time asking, I'm like just let it rest
Can I get a minute to breath? They're like, no
What's up with you and so and so?

But in my heart I know this ain't gon' be our last kiss
It's too big we just can't quit
What you think this is, our love will always exist
Oh, listen to me

Boy, you know we true so stop crying
What we got is still something, something
Oh, this feeling is too good to miss
And ain't no kiss gon' never be our last kiss

Well, you said you'd never leave me
So I kept believing that eventually
We gon' kiss away the hurt, do it like it were
And wake up how we used to be

Never let it go, get it right, bring it back home, stick the light
'Cause of what you want it's in your eyes
We gon' make it through this, I'll prove it
Something that our love will not fade away, always everlasting

And in my heart I know this ain't gon' be our last kiss
It's too big we just can't quit
What you think this is, our love will always exist
Oh, listen to me

Boy, you know we true so stop crying
What we got is still something, something
Oh, this feeling is too good to miss
And ain't no kiss gon' never be our last kiss

What we got is too real, it's too real
Have to be last kiss
I mean it's too big for us to quit, you know
I know you don't believe that it's over like this, you know it

In my heart I know this ain't gon' be our last kiss
It's too big we just can't quit
What you think this is, our love will always exist
Oh, listen to me

Boy, you know we true so stop crying
What we got is still something, something
Oh, this feeling is too good to miss
And ain't no kiss gon' never be our last kiss
In my heart I know this ain't gon' be our last kiss
It's too big we just can't quit
What you think this is, our love will always exist
Oh, listen to me
Boy, you know we true so stop crying
What we got is still something, something
Oh, this feeling is too good to miss
And ain't no kiss gon' never be our last kiss
