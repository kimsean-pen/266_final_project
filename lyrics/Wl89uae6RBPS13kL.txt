Thong, th-thong, thong, thong
Thong, th-thong, thong, thong
Thong, th-thong, thong, thong

"Thong Song," I'ma bring the part two
G'donk, G'donk, I'ma make you blush fool
My junk, hypnotise the whole room
Bump, bump, I'ma rub it up on you
My peach, juicy soft and so delicious
My seat is here to bring you wicked wishes
True love, come on baby turn it up
My curves are ready, ain't you heard enough?

News travels fast
When you've got an ass like
My sweet design
Baby got back I'ma clap that
It's a man trap
I'ma move it to the high hat
Uh, huh
Watch my, sweet design
Thong, th-thong, thong, thong
