Reborn with shining dreams
A spark of childish hope
Glory to see
Headed for the dark
With no safety rope

Afraid to turn around
Forcing me to grow
Finishing [?]
Only time will tell

Clinging to a shaky line
Insecure about what I will see
Mouth the unstable beat
It's overwhelming me

I am stuck on mountains
Mountains of doubts
I am stuck on mountains
Mountains of empathy

The end is near to what I saw
The goal has turned to dreams I [?]
My image changing silently
The way back down is turning steep
How do I stay away from self-pity
And back to sleep

Where did I go wrong?

I am stuck on mountains

I am stuck on mountains
Mountains of doubt
I am stuck on mountains
Mountains of empathy
I am stuck on mountains
Mountains of doubt
I am stuck on mountains
Mountains of empathy
