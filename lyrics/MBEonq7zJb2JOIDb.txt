Its been a long year
Since we last spoke.
How's your halo?
Just between you and I
You and me and the satellites
I never believed you
I only wanted to
Before all of this
What did I miss?
Do you ever get homesick?
I can't get used to it
I can't get used to it
I'll never get used to it
I'll never get used to it
I'm under that night
I'm under those same stars
We're in a red car
You asleep at my side
Going in and out of the headlights
Could I have saved you?
Would that 've betrayed you?
I want to burn this film
you alone with those pills.
what you couldn't do I will
I forgive you.
I'll forgive you
I'll forgive you
I'll forgive you
For blue, blue skies
For blue, blue skies
For blue, blue skies
For blue, blue skies
For blue, blue skies
For blue, blue skies
For blue, blue skies
For blue, blue skies
For blue, blue skies
For blue, blue skies
For blue, blue skies
For blue, blue skies
For blue, blue skies
For blue, blue skies
For blue, blue skies
For blue, blue skies
I'll forgive you.
For blue, blue skies
I'll forgive you.
For blue, blue skies
I'll forgive you.
For blue, blue skies
I'll forgive you.
For blue, blue skies
I'll forgive you.
For blue, blue skies
I'll forgive you.
For blue, blue skies
I'll forgive you.
For blue, blue skies
I'll forgive you.
For blue, blue skies
I'll forgive you.
For blue, blue skies
I'll forgive you.
For blue, blue skies
I'll forgive you.
For blue, blue skies
I'll forgive you.
For blue, blue skies
I'll forgive you.
For blue, blue skies
I'll forgive you.
For blue, blue skies
I'll forgive you.
