I know you're sound asleep right now
and you can't hear but I'm gonna explain everything.
and turn this into every dream
your pretty little head could ever come up with.

I am drunk with the thought of sharing these blankets right now.
I think were old enough to know.
I think were old enough that we would know better if we should know better.

I pretend that I'm already someone, and all my problems faded away.
Whoa oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh.
I pretend that I'm already someone, and all my problems faded away.
I pretend that I'm already someone. I pretend that I'm already someone.

I should be sound asleep right now
but I'm not so I'm gonna explain everything
and hope that you can hear me
so your pretty little head goes undisrupted.

I'm drunk with the thought of sharing these blankets right now.

I think were old enough to know.
I think were old enough that we would know better if we should know better.

I pretend that I'm already someone, and all my problems faded away.
