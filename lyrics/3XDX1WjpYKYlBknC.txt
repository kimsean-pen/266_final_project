When you find somebody to hold you, that's when you've made it
Don't be shy crocodile, mama always tells you

You're a natural supersoul find yourself and lose control
As you do
You're so natural supersoul find yourself and lose control
I would too

Someday you'll see there's nothing to be but you
(Nothing to be but you)
Someday you'll find the things that shine and bloom
(The things that shine and bloom)

When you feel under dressed and basic, that's when you're perfect
Hold your fire crocodile, mama always tells you

You're a natural supersoul find yourself and lose control
As you do
You're so natural supersoul find yourself and lose control
I would too

Don't fall below, just keep all the good things close
(Keep all the good things close)
Someday you'll find the thing that shines the most
(The thing that shines the most)
Someday you'll find you'll be fine

You're a natural supersoul find yourself and lose control
As you do
You're so natural supersoul find yourself and lose control
I would too
You're a natural supersoul
As you do
You're so natural supersoul
I would too
