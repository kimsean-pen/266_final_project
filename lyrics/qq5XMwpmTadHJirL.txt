I hope your flowers bloom
I hope your flowers bloom
I hope your flowers bloom
I hope your flowers bloom
I hope you grow up to be
Everything that you want to
I hope your flowers bloom
I hope your flowers bloom

I hope you know you're the world
You are so special to me
I hope you grow up to be
Even kinder than me
I hope you get to see all of the world
From mountain to seas
I hope you reach all your dreams
I hope that that's what you need
I wanna see you grow
Into a beautiful tree
I hope you get to go
To destinations you dream
The galaxy in your eyes
Your hair is wavy as streams
I hope that you see the world
Hope it's as kind as can be
