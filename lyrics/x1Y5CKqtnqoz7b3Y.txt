Maybe it was all just a daydream
Mirage of water in a dessert land
Starin' out the window in the classroom
Imaginin' us hand and hand
Oh-oh-oh
Maybe I just wanted love so badly
I drew up to look like you
Colored in the corners with some lipstick
Whats a girl at rock show supposed do?

Hollywood heat fillin' my sky
With that boy band hero from junior high
Grass stained jeans, my head in the clouds
Beside the red flag fires and drink-filled doubts
Oh-oh-oh I'm sendin' up a prayer
Oh-oh-oh a little goodbye cry
For that boy band hero from junior high

Maybe it was all just a fantasy:
The pink skies drivin' to his house
The cocaine kisses at midnight
Little lies I told myself
Oh-oh-oh
Maybe it was all just a daydream
And now I'm finally wide awake
Teacher hit a ruler to my textbook
We've both had as much as we can take

Hollywood heat fillin' my sky
With that boy band hero from junior high
Grass stained jeans, my head in the clouds
Beside the red flag fires and drink-filled doubts
Oh-oh-oh I'm sendin' up a prayer
Oh-oh-oh a little goodbye cry
For that boy band hero from junior high

It was just a dream, it was just a daydream
It was just a dream, it was just a daydream
It was just a dream, it was just a daydream
It was just a dream,
it was just a dayIt was just a dream, it was just a daydream
It was just a dream, it was just a daydream
It was just a dream, it was just a daydream
It was just a dream, it was just a dream...

Hollywood heat fillin' my sky
With that boy band hero from junior high
Grass stained jeans, my head in the clouds
Beside the red flag fires and drink-filled doubts
Oh-oh-oh I'm sendin' up a prayer
Oh-oh-oh a little goodbye cry
For that boy band hero from junior high
