Crawling the walls through every crack and crevice teems
Blackness washing over the windowpanes, painting the buildings in between
Creeping down the alleyways, consuming every street
Soundless swarm of nothingness sure to doom us all

Pulling screaming earthlings into its toothless jaws
Endlessly beginning; spreading with no sign of stop
Horror of horrors truly maddening in size
Running just prolongs the end; inevitably it strides

Where has it come from? How can it be stopped?
So quickly we're to meet our end, our empire we have lost
Karmatic armageddon no religion could foresee
A planet once forsaken; not even a memory

Streetlights bend into the void; cars enveloped whole
Darkness deeper than a blindman's sleep soon to paint the world
Insatiable its hunger, it drinks the sea without a belch
Stretching to the other side where it is sure to meet itself

Unearthly vacuum devouring the hourglass now empty
It's time to say goodbye, watching your life flash before mortal eyes
Terror fills your heart; screams of anguish greet your ears
Living death; voracious, insidious, impervious to damage we are slaughtered as if lambs

Horror of horrors truly maddening in size
Running just prolongs the end; inevitably it strides
Where has it come from? How can it be stopped?
So quickly we're to meet our end; our empire we have lost
Karmatic armageddon no religion could foresee
A planet once forsaken; not even a memory
