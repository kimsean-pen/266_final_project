How do you get in
A mind-state to kill?
How do you get in
A mind-state to kill?
I need a fill
Violence to bust up
The silence for real
Traumatized thinking
To hide how I feel

The truth is alive and well
It's underground living
On the Wi-Fi still
Don't buy all the lies they sell
When the Black Hawk flies,
Heading right for the hills

They put a hole in the
Back of my head,
Called it suicide
Woke up with these holes
In my hands from the day
I was crucified
You decide if you wanna ride,
Can't stop us when we unified
I woke up with these holes
In my hands from the day
I was crucified
Stigmata!

(Stigmata)

There ain't no hero
To save the day
Figure to pave the way quicker
To stave another day
A way before we gotta pay
The grave digger
It's all up to us to deliver
I walk through the valley
With the snakes, they slither
The rain gets thicker and
The pain gets thickest
Who's gonna rise when
Sins prey the sinners?
The truth won't die,
But they pulled that trigger

They put a hole in the
Back of my head,
Called it suicide
Woke up with these holes
In my hands from the
Day I was crucified
You decide if
You wanna ride,
Can't stop us when we unified
I woke up with these holes
In my hands from the
Day I was crucified
Stigmata!

(Stigmata)

Burn me down
Shoot me bare
Watch me drown
I don't care

Drag your nails
Cross my mind
Still I walk sanctified

(The truth won't die when
They pull that trigger!
Stigmata
The truth won't die when
They pull that trigger!)
They put a hole in the
Back of my head,
Called it suicide
I woke up with these holes
In my hands from the day
I was crucified
You decide if
You wanna ride,
Can't stop us
When we unified
They put a hole in
The back of my head,
Called it suicide
Stigmata!
