Judy's born to run
Judy couldn't waste no time
She moved to the city
Where Judy loved the boys
Judy loved the lights
Something going on every night
There's a lot of things she loves
But something she hates
Come on, Judy
But the bugs in your bed
The rats in the walls
And the bill collecting phone calls
Make it harder and harder
And the rent's going up
The rent's going up
So she thinks about the east bay
It's getting harder and harder
Now there's some things she loves
But a lot of things she hates
So you think about going
You think about staying
There's somethings in life that you should never know
And I know you wanna stay
But I think you should go
Judy, come on
Judy, come on
Judy, come on
Don't waste your time
Judy, Judy, Judy
Always on time
Judy, Judy, Judy
Always on time
Judy, come on
Judy, come on
Judy, come on
Judy, come on
Judy, come on
Judy, come on
Judy, come on
Judy, come on
Judy, come on
