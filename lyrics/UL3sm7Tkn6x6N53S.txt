never before have I turned on you
ya look too good to me
your beady eyes nearly cut me into
and I just can't let ya be
well it's a free-for-all
and I heard it said
you can bet your life
the stakes are high and so am I
it's in the air toni-i-ight

I see you there with your
cheshire grin I got my eyes on you
ya shake your tail feathers in my face
no tellin what i might do
well looky here ya sweet young thing
cause the magic's in my hands
when in doubt i whip it out
I got me a rock and roll band
It's a free-for-all

ooh, baby
ooh, I gotya
aaaaaaa
