You've been such a jerk, since you left last week
You're careful with your words, but I'm pulling teeth
You said this wouldn't hurt, give me cavities and
All of your apologies are only empty calories

After all this time, I start askin' why i'm stayin'
Were you ever mine? Are we something that's worth savin'
Every conversation puts me back on medication
Sometimes, sorry's just another word you're sayin'

Do I look like her, does she talk like me?
Been' feeling insecure, co-dependency is
Hard to break when you, never make it easy
Reconstructive surgery, can't fix my anxiety

After all this time, I start askin' why i'm stayin'
Were you ever mine? Are we something that's worth savin'
Every conversation puts me back on medication
Sometimes, sorry's just another word you're sayin'

Take me to, the hospital
I need Paracetamol
Tramadol, Ketamine
I just need some pain relief
Take me to, the hospital
Fill me up, with Tylenol
Tramadol, Ketamine
I just need some pain relief, oh
