Winter of the ages so dark so cold
That flames turn into the bluest frost
Mountains of ice
Rises above a dead and frozen ground
The ravens return to the hills
And the Millennium black bells of eternal frost
Chime to the Northern lightning

Upon the mountainside I stand
The floods of black runs below
Hair of a cold goatscalp I kiss
Eye's taken mountain still breathes at one
To the poisoned ground

Midnight darksky open up
A blast of red lightning rides the night
With doom winds death's angels fly
Across a nearly closed skyline
And the sun freezes at one
With the infernal holocaust frozen clouds

Centuries of doom reigned by the Goatthrone of desire
Raised by sorcery to the Holocaust sky

North black hordes storm
Through invincible cyclones of frostwinds
I lift my hands
And join the ceremonial circle of one wind
Eye of stone now sleep
Into eternal nights
This winter is forever
A wind of red I rode
A wind of evil cold

For the years that have passed in the North
Brought me visions of the Goatthrone of desire

On the hillside where I stood left for another world
Tragedies blows at horizon
The sun freezes to dust

A perfect vision of the rising Northland
