Just moments before the dawn
It's their time to go
One look and they enter the magic forest
They're left alone

A strange weight surrounds them
It felt like burnt ice
All branches, like fingers they reach to catch them
Leaving their marks

Hey you, little songbirds
Come here, little songbirds
We see you, little songbirds
And we'll keep you

Hey you in'come here resemble

Run for your life, she's getting closer
Run for your life, you hear her breathing
Run for your life, her army's marching
Run for your life, you feel her seeking
Reaching you, hunting you

Run for your life, she's getting closer
Run for your life, you hear her breathing
Run for your life, her army's marching
Run for your life, you feel her seeking
Reaching you, hunting all of you

They ran deeper into the woods
They wished they could fly
In the moonlight, they saw those lurking soldiers
Creeping by
Her hunters were whispering
And humming an old tune
Like Rolling
They passed those little seekers
Leaving them alone

Hey you, little songbirds
Come here, little songbirds
Where are you, little songbirds?
Come, we'll keep you

Run for your life, she's getting closer
Run for your life, you hear her breathing
Run for your life, her army's marching
Run for your life, you feel her seeking
Reaching you, hunting you

Run for your life, she's getting closer
Run for your life, you hear her breathing
Run for your life, her army's marching
Run for your life, you feel her seeking
Reaching you, hunting all of you

Oh dear children
Who has brought you here?
Do come in and stay with me
No harm shall happen to you

Run for your life, she's getting closer
Run for your life, you hear her breathing
Run for your life, her army's marching
Run for your live, you feel her seeking
Reaching you, hunting you

Run for your life, she's getting closer
Run for your life, you hear her breathing
Run for your life, her army's marching
Run for your life, you feel her seeking
Reaching you, hunting all of you
