Out of sight, out of mind
in the darkness there's no light
day ago, now I know
What in means to stay in faith
I won't give up, I won't give in
I'll give it everything
This feeling is real

I wait for my love
To come home, home, home... come home, home, home
And I wait for my love
To come home, home, home... come home, home, home

Help me stand, help me rise
I can't bare the change in tide
This is the road we chose to take,
no regrets and no mistakes
They say patience is a virtue but I can't get through
This feeling is real

I only know that now

I wait for my love
To come home, home, home... come home, home, home
And I wait for my love
To come home, home, home... come home, home, home

This feeling is real

I only know that now

I wait for my love
To come home, home, home... come home, home, home
And I wait for my love
To come home, home, home... come home, home, home
I wait for my love
To come home, home, home... come home, home, home
And I wait for my love
To come home, home, home... come home, home, home
