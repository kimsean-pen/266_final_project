I always try
to keep my eyes from closing besides
I still see you
it seems so right
to think of the time we could have tonight
and it's so cold
it seems my hands
are colder than yours, warm me up inside
your face turns red and so does mine
and we climb all around
you stare into my eyes and watch me
drown inside
you whisper to me softly as I lie
you shine so bright
a light inside my head i love the thought
of staring at you
asleep at night
kaleidoscopic thoughts of me and you
and you're just so cool
for me to see
the life we'd have and we'd tell everyone
your face turns red and so does mine
and we climb all around
you stare into my eyes and watch me
drown inside
and whisper to me softly as I lie
