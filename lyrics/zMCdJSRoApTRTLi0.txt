In the shallow holes of a thousand eyes
in the knee-deep graves of future survivors
The fleshless guests live off children of the past
Their aging fingers cast the Shadow of Death

Their razor sharp tongues invite to relax
as they slip the skin of your eyelids back
invasive spectators get into the act
with roses and candles
silver knives and spoons

persona read women dance with priests on a side road
your vision perspectives are turning to stone
cabaret slide show starts shooting their loads
Act one is the end, the show
now begins...

Their razor sharp tongues invite to relax
as they slip the skin of your eyelids back
invasive spectators get into the act
with roses and candles
silver knives and spoons

Breath ballet prancers spin on porcelain backbones
a child's muddled cry turns into hilarity
ungracious freeloaders leave their dead on a doorstep
Flowers of doom bloom in prosperity
luxuries of past days are
luxuries of our days
luxuries of past days
luxuries of our days
