It's been so many years since we've been friends
And after all this time I need you again
And I'd try
Oh I'd try
But I'd hurt myself again

Laugh for me just one more time again
Cause soon I know that all these things will end
And I'd try
Oh I'd try
But I'd hurt myself again

Never let me change my mind again
Because I don't think I'll ever love again
And I'd try
Oh I'd try
But I'd hurt myself again
