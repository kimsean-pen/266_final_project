Felt someone calling me into the howling of the wind
I heard the reflection of a sound echoing through my skin
And a distant drum rumbling under ground gently guides me on
Through my wild heart whispering to me

The sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon

She is awakening in dark swells and mystery
Unbridled nightmares powerful and running free
You could still hear her cries reverberating through the trees
For the trampled flowers, the daughters of Eve

The sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon

They brought her in, in a new white dress
But the stain left an ache on her mother's breast
Now all that's left are the ghostly steps
From a distant corridor

And a distant drum rumbling under ground
Gently guides me on through my wild heart
Whispering to me, to me, to me

The sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon

The sisters of Avalon
The sisters of Avalon
The sisters of Avalon
The sisters come on, sisters come on, sisters
