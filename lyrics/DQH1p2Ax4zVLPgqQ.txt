I knew from the start
Full of ghost and creatures within our hearts
A ship I wanna see
Because I'm waiting on the spot
And as we electrify
The lightening does it for our hearts
Like ships are lonely seen
Cut down and after that.

And I don't even know
Back down to get together
Who wants to surprise
Make up, we need another one!

Instrumental
Yes, I need a friend
Seeing things in black and white again
A man only seen

Cut down in Netherlands.
And I don't even know
Back down to get together
Who wants to surprise
Make up, we need another one!
I don't even know
Back down to get together
Who wants to surprise
Make up, we need another one!
Instrumental
And I don't even know
Back down to get together
Who wants to surprise
Make up, we need another one!
And I don't even know
Back down to get together
Who wants to surprise
Make up, we need another one!
