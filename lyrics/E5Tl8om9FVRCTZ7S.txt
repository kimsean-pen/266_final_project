Sun baked bones stripped clean
Fangs sparkle and gleam
Claws drip of freshly shed blood
While the corpses
Of our masses
Rot in the mud
Sun falls
As no moon rises
The darkest of nights
Are full of surprises
In the distance a dog howls
Beneath our feet
Lurks something foul

One by one
Bodies rise from the ground
Deafened ears
Hear not a sound
Dead set free
Evil reings supreme
Gather demon clans
By the light of the moon

Feasting on your flesh
The living dead
Time has no meaning
It's the day we dread
Gazing out eof eyes
Decaying and old
Humanity has fallen
The bell tolls
