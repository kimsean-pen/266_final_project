When winter comes in summer
When there's no more forever (yeah yeah)
That's when I'll stop loving you (that's when I'll stop loving you)
(That's when I'll stop loving you)

I'm sure you've heard these words before
And I know it's hard for you to trust them once more
You're afraid it all might end
And a broken heart is scared of breakin' again

But you've gotta believe me
I'm never leavin'
You'll never cry long as I am there
And I will always be there
You will never be without love

When winter comes in summer
When there's no more forever
When lies become the truth
Oh you know then, baby
That's when I'll stop loving
That's when I'll stop loving you
(That's when I'll stop loving you, yeah)

Long as sunlight lights the sky
The light of love will be
Found in these eyes of mine (these eyes of mine)
And I will shine that light for you
You're the only one
I'll ever give this heart to

What I'm trying to say is (to say)
Nothing will change this
There'll be no time you won't find me there
Cause I will always be there
You will always have all my love

When winter comes in summer
When there's no more forever
When lies become the truth
Well you know then, baby
That's when I'll stop loving
That's when I'll stop loving you
(That's when I'll stop loving you)

When this world doesn't turn anymore
When the stars all decide to stop shining
Till then I'm gonna be by your side
I'm gonna be loving you forever
Every day of my life. baby
Oh yeah yeah

Well you know then baby
That's when I'll stop loving
That's when I'll stop loving

That's when I'll stop loving you
When winter comes in summer
When there's no more forever
When lies become the truth (lies become the truth yeah)
Well you know then, baby
That's when I'll stop loving (that's when I'll stop loving)
That's when I'll stop loving you

When winter comes in summer
When there's no more forever
When lies become the truth
(Well you know then, baby)
That's when I'll stop loving (that's when I'll stop babe)
That's when I'll stop loving you

That's when I stop baby
I'll stop babe
Lovin' you
