I will fist you in a f*cking gutter, go away
I'm so sick of waking up, I just might f*cking stop
I've got red on my fingertips and I'll stay cursed till I f*cking drop

Every morning feel like hell again
F*cking everything up, I don't know where to begin
Paralyzed, heartache took a toll on me again
Then I found a pretty b*tch with that ghost white skin
Casper annihilate me till I'm dead
I need something to believe in again
I'm but a shell of myself with no head
I see it rolling away from me right into those (hands)
F*ck till my d*ck fall off, aye
Ate her till my face went numb
Hand around her throat, watch her pupils blacken
Then I'm back up in her soul till the c*m flow go then her face go
Red
Aye, nails on my chest, blood flow
Shawty had me looking like a Freddy victim

1, 2, 3, go

One by one, you're all going down
I'll make you see
Traveling alone since birth and
I've never felt so liberated

F*ck
