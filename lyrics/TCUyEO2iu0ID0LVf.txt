Mmmmh
Mmmh
Mmmmh

Why you make me work so hard
To put on that evening show?
When you know that all I want
Is to make your money grow?

You're like a baby
Who don't got nowhere to go
I feel you eyeing me
You keep it on the low (on the low, on the low)

But I can't let you in
And I can't keep you out
I wait for life to win
But it never comes around

And I can't hear you call
And I can't hear me shout
I wait for it to break
But it never comes around

Don't know me
I'm lonely
I'm lonely

Why you make me take that shit
To put on that evening show?
When you know I don't need it?
Better than your booze and blow

You're like a baby
Don't know better, you don't know
You drag me down
You try to keep it on the low

But I can't let you in
And I can't keep you out
I wait for life to win
But it never comes around

And I can't hear you call
And I can't hear me shout
I wait for it to break
But it never comes around

Ehhh-Ahhh
Feel like I'm falling apart
Ehhh-Ahhh
Feel like I'm falling apart
Ehhh-Ahhh
Feel like I'm falling apart

Would you tell me?
Would you tell me?
Would you tell me?

But I can't let you in
And I can't keep you out
I wait for life to win
But it never comes around

And I can't hear you call
And I can't hear me shout
I wait for it to break
But it never comes around

Don't know me
I'm lonely
I'm lonely
