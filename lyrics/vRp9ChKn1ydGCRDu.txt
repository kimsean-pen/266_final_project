I'm on a mission, I made my decision
To lead a path of self-destruction
A slow progression, killing my complexion
And it's rotting out my teeth

I'm on a roll
No self-control
I'm blowing off steam with
Methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want
And that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face

Every hour, my blood is turning sour
And my pulse is beating out of time
I found a treasure, filled with sick pleasure
And it sits on a thin white line

I'm on a roll
No self-control
I'm blowing off steam with
Methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want
And that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face

I'm on a mission, I got no decision
Like a cripple running the rat race
Wish in one hand and shit in the other
And see which one gets filled first

I'm on a roll
No self-control
I'm blowing off steam with
Methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want
And that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face
Geek... stink... breath!
