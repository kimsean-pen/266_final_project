You and me
We come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me
When I look at other girls

Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby
'Cause the Dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

You look at me
You've got nothing left to say
I'm gonna pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance
You won't sing
I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring

Well there's nothing I can do
I Only Wanna Be With You
You can call me your fool
I Only Wanna Be With You

Put on a little Dylan
Sitting on a fence
I say that line is great
You ask me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray
Took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky

I Only Wanna Be With You
Ain't Bobby so cool
I Only Wanna Be With You

Yeah I'm tangled up and blue
I Only Wanna Be With You
You can call me your fool
I Only Wanna Be With You

Sometimes I wonder
If it will ever end
You get so mad at me
When I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby yeah
The Dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I Only Wanna Be With You
You can call me your fool
I Only Wanna Be With You
Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I Only Wanna Be With You
I Only Wanna Be With You
I Only Wanna Be With You
I Only Wanna Be With You
