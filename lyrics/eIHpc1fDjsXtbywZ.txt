And It seems as though
I'm on my own
And time transcends, oh!

And it seems I speak
like waters leak
And I'm losing friends, oh!

And there'll be coins on my eyes
There'll be coins on my eyes
To pay Charon
before I let you near my son

And I don't feel well
oh, couldn't you tell,
from the way I touch my face?

My thoughts are low
And I cannot grow
In this small space, oh!

But there'll be coins on my eyes
There'll be coins on my eyes
To pay Charon,
before I let you near my son

And I ain't no,
And I ain't no,
And I ain't no Hercules
I ain't no Hercules
