Pick yourself up
Ain't nobody helping no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass nigga, pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass bitch, pick yourself up, pick yourself up

Income tax check, you blow that shit
Body foreign, they repo that shit
She leave your dick dry, that ain't your bitch
Your partners made it rain but you ain't Tip
Lame nigga, fame get ya nuthin' but cameras and lights
Money on the table you want friends in life
Swipe up, wipe down, all the fresh for sale
Ain't no handouts here, nigga you can't tell
I'm I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T nigga you can't spell
What you know 'bout me, I don't know 'bout free
Money fall like leaves, better climb that tree

Pick yourself up
Pick yourself up
Ain't nobody helping no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass nigga, pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass bitch, pick yourself up, pick yourself up

I was sitting on the curb by my grandma yard
Dopeboys drive by, I'm like that's my car
Fast forward, stack four, nigga that's my car
Push button, automatic, bitch I own that start
Dime back, I don't bend, I don't starve for mine
Will rap for a mil, coulda had that sign
Ride dirty, late night, coulda had that time
Way up pilin', drop top, you can't have this shine
Aw mane, cold game, if these walls could talk
They say "stack that shit, nigga get that vault"
Young and safe fucked up, that shit ain't my fault
Nigga pay them dues, nigga pay that cost

Pick yourself up
Pick yourself up
Ain't nobody helping no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass nigga, pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass bitch, pick yourself up, pick yourself up

Weave right, edges right, but your bills ain't paid
Sugar daddy fly you out but you still can't stay
Overnight, Gucci bag, you back on that plane
He married, you mad that you got played
Think you run run game, he ain't called you since
Homegirls got change but you call them lame
Cause they got that foreign, they buy all they clothes
They don't need no man, but you still that hoe
Every man you fuck with tryin' to swear his oaths
Every man you fuck with fuck been catch ghosts
'Cause the cars they drive like I'm off the flame
You ain't pimpin' the game tryna fuck for change

Pick yourself up
Pick yourself up
Ain't nobody helping no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
Pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass nigga, pick yourself up, pick yourself up
No broke ass bitch, pick yourself up, pick yourself up
