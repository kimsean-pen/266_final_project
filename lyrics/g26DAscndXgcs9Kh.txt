After foggy and funereal days
In a mixture of sadness and devotion
Memory and mental escape
I take back my life

A bit confused, but
More conscious of my way

After foggy and funereal days
In a mixture of sadness and devotion
Memory and mental escape
I take back my life

I wish warm affections
True emotions, absence of artifice

I want to rock myself on my arts
Enjoying the new time
But I don't forget where I come from
And people who loved me

I want to rock myself on my arts
Enjoying the new time
But I don't forget where I come from
And people who loved me
