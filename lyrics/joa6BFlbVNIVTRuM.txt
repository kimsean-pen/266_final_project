I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna fly
Camma cas ista into the night
I know who you are
And I know who you where
My sunami love
Breaks my body softly

Oooo
Oooo

Heading down to Mexico tonight
You just wouldn't let it go
You don't know what you're asking for
Heading down to Mexico tonight
You just wouldn't let it go
You don't know what you're asking for

Concity of self given
My sumbi mind
Already clocked out
I know who you are
And I know who you where
My redhead
A fox in a hen house

Heading down to Mexico tonight
You just wouldn't let it go
You don't know what you're asking for
Heading down to Mexico tonight
You just wouldn't let it go
You don't know nothing at all
You just wouldn't let it go

You just wouldn't let it go

Ooo
Ooo
Ooo

You just wouldn't let it go

Heading down to Mexico tonight
You just wouldn't let it go
You don't know what you're asking for
You just wouldn't let it go
Heading down to Mexico tonight
You just wouldn't let it go
You don't know what you're asking for

You just wouldn't let it go
