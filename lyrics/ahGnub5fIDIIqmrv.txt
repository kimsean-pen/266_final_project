I've gone too many nights
Chasing the shadow of your silhouette
Moving just to survive
All that I wanted was to start again

Stumbling through the crowd
Feet lifting off the ground looking for you
Washing my fear away
Standing here face to face
Nothing to lose
I won't look back now

I feel the love
I wanna get to know you
I feel the love
Let the past burn into the sun
I feel the love
I really wanna show you now
I feel the love
I wanna get to know you
I feel the love
Let the past burn into the sun
Can't get enough
So much I wanna show you now

It's not over tonight
Stay in this moment, we can hide away
Cause they're gonna turn on the lights
But we're burning bright, no, we'll never fade

Stumbling through the crowd
Feet lifting off the ground looking for you
Washing my fear away
Standing here face to face
Nothing to lose
I won't look back now

I feel the love
I wanna get to know you
I feel the love
Let the past burn into the sun
I feel the love
I really wanna show you now
I feel the love
I wanna get to know you
I feel the love
Let the past burn into the sun
Can't get enough
So much I wanna show you now

I feel the love
Can't get enough
I feel the love
I really wanna show you now

I feel the love
I wanna get to know you
I feel the love
Let the past burn into the sun
Can't get enough
So much I wanna show you now
