It's like a stranger had a key, came inside of my mind
And moved all my things around
But he didn't know snakes can't kneel or prey
Try to break the psyche down

It's as if my feathers were wax
And your artillery lead
Do you like our bed?
Do you like our bed?

Deep six, six, six feet deep
Deep six, six, six feet deep
