["What happens to the soul after it has left a human body"]

Instinct of immortality
Become a part of eternity
Spirits of evil into the essence
The very creature of a living entity

Succeeding lives
A black soul's purification
A new being on the path of evolution
The way to it's destination

Cycle of rebirth
The spiritual law of continuity
Mirages of earthly existence
It shall not cease with the body

Survival of death
From one incarnation into another
Reflections of an unknown reality
Summons what can't be discovered

Fight to release from the cycle
To reach the divinity
From where it arose, once more descend
Into an inner mental unity

Birth into a new life
Loss of personality
The immortal element in man
Shall live a real life in infinity

Lost souls
