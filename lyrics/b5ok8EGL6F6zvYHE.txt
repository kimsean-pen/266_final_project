Stand in the dark
A little while longer
That way they'll never figure us out
Induce in the morning

Sleep in the park
And eat on the corner
'Cause there we gonna spend it for life
Ah, ah

No, we got a long way
No, we got a long, long way to go
No, we got a long way
Yeah, we got a long, long way to go

We can't survive on love baby (baby)
No, no, ah
We can't survive on love baby
We can't survive on just the, just the love baby (baby)
We can't go alone, oh love
If we do, then we die

Take out the trash
And throw out your wallet
Been living in the shack in your heart
And waste out my college

Dress me in rags
Just make sure my shoes fit
To walk around this life like I have

No, we got a long way
No, we got a long, long way to go
No, we got a long way
Yeah, we got a long, long way to go

We can't survive on love baby (baby)
No, no, ah
We can't survive on love baby
We can't survive on just the, just the love baby (baby)
We can't go alone, oh love
If we do, then we die

Yeah, we got a long, long way to go
We can't survive on love baby
We can't survive on love baby (baby)
No, no, ah
We can't survive on the love
We can't survive on just the, just the love baby (baby)
We can't go alone, oh love
If we do, then we die
