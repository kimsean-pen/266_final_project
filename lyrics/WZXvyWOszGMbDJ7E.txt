Behold glory in our hands
Glory staring into skin
Vast like the sky
Flesh and blood
Stars in space reaching onward

SELF reaching outward
Into the within
Without armor
On and on
Ever deeper
SELF reaching outward
Into within

Beyond the eyes
A hidden life
Beyond the ears
A symphony
Selfless beating heart
Rhythm of the breath

Life inherent
Before we dreamed of two
Life inherent
Before we dreamed of one

Another night that sets the eye
To the truth
Burning tall towards the mountain
Feeding all that come to see
The beast
With the blood that breathes
The release

Arresting dawn
Bringing the rest to see
All our deliverers
Have seen here before
Another day rooted in
Fallen trees
Wash the mind at sea
Distant silver shore
Bring my body
