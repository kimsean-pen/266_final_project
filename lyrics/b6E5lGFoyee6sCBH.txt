Daylight
I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long
You made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for boy like that to go on
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh

If you want it (yeah)
You can have it (oh, oh, oh)
If you need it (ooh)
We can make it (oh)
If you want it
You can have it
But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin' (oh)
Now stay woke (stay woke)
Niggas creepin' (niggas creepin')
Now don't you close your eyes

Too late
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid
I'm trying not to waste my time

If you want it (yeah)
You can have it (oh oh ohh)
If you need it (oooh)
We can make it (oh)
If you want it
You can have it
But stay woke (stay woke)
Niggas creepin' (niggas creepin')
They gon' find you (they gon' find you)
Gon' catch you sleepin' (gon' catch you sleepin')
Now stay woke (stay woke)
Niggas creepin' (niggas creepin')
Now don't you close your eyes
But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you (they gon' find you)
Gon' catch you sleepin' (ooh)
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes

How'd it get so scandalous? (How'd it get so scandalous?)
Oh, so scandalous? (Oh, so scandalous?)
How'd it get so scandalous? (Oooh)
Aaaaaaah
Now don't you close your eyes
