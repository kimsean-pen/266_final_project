I'm I myself alone
Realise I never need to use no one
When it comes down to my soul
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above

There was a time I was so afraid
of everyting people around me said
That I wanted to hide my face in the shadows
There was a time on a bed of nails
I was dreaming a plan I thought could not fail
but no power under the sun could pull it together

I can't take this attitude
Got to show now I've got to move on
God knows where I'm going to
It's a lonely burning question

I'm I myself alone
Realise I never need to use no one
Money, power, Holy roads
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
Whoa

If there's a time that we ever see
The nature of life in reality
Then I want to be there
to kick at the answer

I can't take this attitude
Got to show now I've got to move on
God knows where I'm going to
It's a lonely burning question

I'm I myself alone (all alone)
Realise I never need to use no one
Money, power, Holy roads (holy roads)
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above

I'm I myself alone (all alone)
Realise I never need to use no one
When it comes down to my soul (to my soul)
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above

(Mid solo)

I'm I myself alone (on my own)
Realise I never need to use no one (no one)
Money, power, Holy roads (holy roads)
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above

I'm I myself alone (myself alone)
Realise I never need to use no one
When it comes down to my soul
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above

None of the above
my faith in none of the above
none of the above
I stand by none of the above... (fade out)
