Better run
Fall in love
Just for an afternoon
Lovin' goes too slow
Light moves alone

A song that plays
Makes me miss
All that I've lost
Till the sun goes down
And the lights go on

It's feeling I'm fine
Gone when you're gone
Hell after this
Is gone when I'm home

If I'm going to hell
After this
I'm gonna enjoy you while I can
I won't remember your face
After this
I'm gonna enjoy you while I can

Got a coin and a sun
Back in time
Looking up
Got the sky on my mind
Have a seat, get a drink
It's time for a change
Feels like god is on my side

It's feeling I'm fine
Gone when you're gone
Hell after this
Is gone when I'm home

If I'm going to hell
After this
I'm gonna enjoy you while I can
I won't remember your face
After this
I'm gonna enjoy you while I can
If I'm going to hell
After this
I'm gonna enjoy you while I can

I'm gonna enjoy you while I can

I'm gonna enjoy you while I can
