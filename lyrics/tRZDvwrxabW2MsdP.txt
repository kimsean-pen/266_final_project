The weight, I'm gone
In my skin, I'm lost
Tangled in the bones of this love
Melding to the flow of your blood
Grace bestowed
But I was shaped with snow
Seasons don't change
Ignorance remains
I need this alone
I need this alone
The burdens on this chest
The vessel of these words
Sinking under tension
Drew after thoughts and hurt
The burdens on this chest
The vessel of these words
Sinking under tension
Drew after thoughts and hurt
I need this alone
I need this alone
I need this alone
I need this alone
I need this alone
The burdens on this chest
The vessel of these words
Sinking under tension
Drew after thoughts and hurt
The burdens on this chest
The vessel of these words
Sinking under tension
Drew after thoughts and hurt
