Uh oh
Here we go
Hit another crossroad
Better make it count cause you never really know
Built up
Broke down
Sick of being pushed around
You want it, you got it
Because the time is right now.

Two steps
One back
Thinking I'm about to crack
Can't start a flame if they never know your name
Take it
Fight it
Light it up
Ignite it
Hotter and higher until the world is on fire

Here it comes
Are you ready?

I always burn brighter
Than the sun shines on the sea
I'm against the odds in this battle
But I don't need you to save me
So I fly so high
Til you realize what I've been fighting for
Whoa
Realize I always burn brighter

Now its cowards
Bitching even louder
Yelling at the world but they haven't done a thing
Say this
Wear that
Try and tell me how to act
Well I'm not your puppet so cut me loose of your strings

I always burn brighter
Than the sun shines on the sea
I'm against the odds in this battle
But I don't need you to save me
So I fly so high
Til you realize what I've been fighting for
Whoa
Realize I always burn brighter

And it lasts so long
I'm so tired of being wrong
But the sun still shines
In the long run, the strong will survive

Uh oh, Here we go
Hit another crossroad

I always burn brighter
Than the sun shines on the sea
I'm against the odds in this battle
But I don't need you to save me
So I fly so high
Til you realize what I've been fighting for
Whoa

Realize I always...
I always burn brighter
Than the sun shines on the sea
I'm against the odds in this battle
But I don't need you to save me
So I fly so high
Til you realize what I've been fighting for
Whoa

Realize I always burn brighter
