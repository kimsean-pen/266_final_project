Makin' a livin' the old hard way
Takin' and givin' my day by day
I dig snow and rain and bright sunshine

Draggin' the line (Draggin' the line)

My dog Sam eats purple flowers
We ain't got much but what we got's ours
We dig snow and rain and bright sunshine

Draggin' the line (Draggin' the line)
Draggin' the line (Draggin' the line)

I feel fine, I'm talkin' 'bout peace of mind
I'm gonna take my time
I'm gettin' the good sign

Draggin' the line (Draggin' the line)
Draggin' the line (Draggin' the line)

Lovin' the free and feelin' spirit
Of huggin' a tree when you get near it
Diggin' the snow and rain and bright sunshine

Draggin' the line (Draggin' the line)
Draggin' the line (Draggin' the line)

I feel fine, I'm talkin' 'bout peace of mind
I'm gonna take my time
I'm gettin' the good sign

Draggin' the line (Draggin' the line)
Draggin' the line (Draggin' the line)
Draggin' the line (Draggin' the line)
Draggin' the line (Draggin' the line)
Draggin' the line (Draggin' the line)
Draggin' the line (Draggin' the line)
Draggin' the line (Draggin' the line)
Draggin' the line (Draggin' the line)
Draggin' the line
