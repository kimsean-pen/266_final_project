Tonight, tonight I'm gonna take what's mine,
tonight, tonight under that bright neon light.
And if I ever find a way right out of here,
Tonight, tonight I'm gonna disappear.

Tonight, tonight oh sweetheart you and I,
Tonight, tonight we've gotta feel alive.
Cos if we ever find a way right out of here,
Tonight, tonight we've gotta disappear.

But it ain't easy, no it ain't easy.
Darling, darling please.

I ain't got long,
So I need you,
To believe in me,
Tonight, tonight.

I can't lose you,
So come with me,
And we'll break free,
Tonight, tonight, we'll shine so bright.

Tonight, tonight we've gotta make our move,
Tonight, tonight we ain't got nothing to lose.
Cos if we ever find a way right out of here,
Tonight, tonight we gotta disappear.

But it ain't easy, no it ain't easy.
Darling, darling please.

We ain't got long,
So I need you,
To believe in me,
Tonight, tonight.

I can't lose you,
So come with me,
And we'll break free,
Tonight, tonight, we'll shine so bright.

Tonight, tonight out on that Great West Road,
I'm scared like you but we can't let it show.
Cos if we ever find a way right out of here,
Tonight, tonight...
