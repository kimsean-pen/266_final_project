She wore crushed velvet
Jet black and to the floor
She rode on angels wings
That used to shine oh so bright

Now the dark has caught the spark in her eyes and I
I can't find the air

(I'll wait for you, I'cross my heart)
Dissolve and decay
There's nothing left for me (Right now)

Walk slowly towards the light
She's calling and I'm falling down
She's crying (she's crying) and I am lying about last night
She can't find a way to tell me
And I can't find the air

(I'll wait for you, I'cross my heart)
Dissolve and decay
There's nothing left for me (Right now)

This fire's dying down
There's nothing left to see (Right now)

Right now!

Dissolve and decay
There's nothing left for me

Sit back and let her die slowly
Don't cry
She didn't love you anyway

Dissolve and decay
There's nothing left for me

Just try to make it out alive, yeah
Alive means your blood is flowing

Right now!

Dissolve and decay
There's nothing left for me (Right now)
This fires dying down
There's nothing left to see (Right now)
