I can let you have your way...
Let you have your way

I can let you have your say
I can hear a warning if you can avoid it
I don't need to care too much
Any way you play with it
You can get away with it
I don't wanna cry no more
What I gotta take care for?

And there's a truth untold
I would put it all on hold
Just for another hour in bed with you
So I'm gonna steal your flow
Baby I can't let you go
Any time you say so
Baby I can let you know

I don't wanna hear the alarm
You don't have to use your charm
You don't have to break my arm
Sleeping does it always
I decide when I decide
I am in the mood right now
Baby, baby

I don't wanna hear the alarm
You don't have to use your charm
You don't have to break my arm
Sleeping does it always
I decide when I decide
I am in the mood right now
Baby come here

I don't wanna hear the alarm
You don't have to use your charm
You don't have to break my arm
Sleeping does it always
I decide when I decide
I am in the mood right now
Baby can we do it right now
Save me from the truth or how
I don't wanna hear the alarm

I don't have to feel your charm
You don't have to break my arm
I don't have to feel your charm
I don't wanna hear the alarm

I don't have to feel your charm
You don't have to break my arm
I don't have to feel your charm
I don't wanna hear the alarm

This bird in the hand
Is time without plans
No chiming or bells
No sound in the head
No sense of a threat
No sound of alarm

I don't have to feel your charm
You don't have to break my arm

No I don't wanna count the calls
I don't wanna love too much
Could give it all away
And I pray for another way
I cannot describe it
I don't wanna try it
Cause we left it undecided
Opinions divided
I don't care

I don't wanna live in my head like a hum baby
When you force to keep me home
And I can't come
Maybe I can steady your flow
Tell me what you know
How to make a true love grow
How to make a true love grow
How to make a true love grow

I don't wanna hear the alarm
You don't have to use your charm
You don't have to break my arm
Sleeping does it always
I decide when I decide
I am in the mood right now
