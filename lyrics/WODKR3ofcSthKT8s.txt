All the people in the crowd
Grab a partner, take it down
It's just me, its just me against the music, yeah
It's whipping my hair
It's pulling my waist
The sweat is dripping all over my face
I'm the only one dancing up in this place
To the beat of the drum, gotta give it that bass
I wanna get stupid
Trying to take my music
It's like a competition
Where's the beat
I wanna get in the zone
I wanna get in the zone
If you really wanna party
Send my love and get ya
Really to hit, you could die
In a minute, i'mma take-a ya on, imma take-a ya on
Come on, yeah,

Let's take on the zone, lets take on the zone
(If you really want to battle)
(It's you and me baby and the music turns our body all night long)
All night long
(We're almost there)
I'm feeling it bad and I can't explain
My hips all moving at a rapid pace(feel it burn)
From the tip of my toes, running through my veins(and nows your turn)
Let me see what ya got, don't hesitate
I wanna get stupid
Trying to take my music
It's like a competition
Where's the beat
I wanna get in the zone
I wanna get in the zone
If you really wanna party

Try to hit, you could die
In a minute, imma take-a ya on, imma take-a ya on
