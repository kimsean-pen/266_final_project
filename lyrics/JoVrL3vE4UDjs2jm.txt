Don't let life pass you by, waste money on what I buy
I don't know why, oh why? I don't know why, oh why?
Don't let life pass you by, waste money on what I buy
I don't know why, oh why? I don't know why, oh why?

Everyday I wake up feeling like I need my life back
Riding on the money train, think I'm on the right track
If we take it from you, you ain't gonna get shit back
I got bitches on stand-by, they'll take your shit fast

Long hair, nails done, bitches hating
Don't be mad 'cause you look basic
I roll grams up and I face it
You know that I stay in the latest

Don't let life pass you by, waste money on what I buy
I don't know why, oh why? I don't know why, oh why?
Don't let life pass you by, waste money on what I buy
I don't know why, oh why? I don't know why, oh why?

Struggling to hold on, the show must go on
Some only came for one song
Some prolly sing the whole set
I been in the worst moods, I been upset
I been having mood swings, saying shit that I can't take back
I got all this money but I wanna go back
They keep on asking where the old me at
For the last time, she ain't never coming back

Long hair, nails done, bitches hating
Don't be mad 'cause you look basic
I roll grams up and I face it
You know that I stay in the latest

Don't let life pass you by, waste money on what I buy
I don't know why, oh why? I don't know why, oh why?
Don't let life pass you by, waste money on what I buy
I don't know why, oh why? I don't know why, oh why?
