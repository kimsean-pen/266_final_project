Said you need to do it,
'Cause you can't feel it tonight,
Well you can if you want to,
Want to take you outside,
Want to show you the sky,
To remind you why you shouldn't,

Do your worst if you can,
Do your worst if you can do it,
You can if you want,
You can take me if you want to run,
Said you wanted to then kissed the gun,
You can if you want to,

And you want to do it,
And you want to do it,
If you want to do it,
You are going to do it,
Even if I don't want you to,

Say you're alright,
'Cause you don't want to see me tonight,
And you won't if you don't want to,
Hide it from me if you must,
Hide it from me if you don't trust,
Anything I say right to you,

And you want to do it,
If you want to do it,
You will if you want to,
And you want to do it,
If you want to do it,
You will if you want to,

And you want to do it,
And you want to do it,
If you want to do it,
You are going to do it,
Even if I don't want you to,

I was inside,
Painting your name on the window,
I was somewhere inside,
And I wanted to find out why you hurt,
And I was terrified,

Look me in the eyes, say you can't do it,
Look me in the eyes, say you can't do it,
but you will if you want to,
Look me in the eyes, say you can't do it,
Look me in the eyes, say you can't do it,
but you will if you want to,

And you want to do it,
And you want to do it,
If you want to do it,
You are going to do it,
Even if I don't want you to,

Shake me down,
Tell me its better,
Tell me that you don't know what you do,

And you want to do it,
If you want to do it,
You will if you want to,
And you want to do it,
If you want to do it,
You will if you want to,
And you want to do it,
If you want to do it,
You will if you want to,

I wish I could make you right.
