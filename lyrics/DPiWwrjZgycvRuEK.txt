They say oil and water don't go together
Rules say can't be flipping switches in stormy weather

I'm living on the edge with the trivia, no
Maybe there's a love that's different
Opposites attract, opposites attract
Maybe I don't care, I'm giving up
But there's a dose of love I forgot
Opposites attract, opposites attract

When pain is the enemy
So this won't be the end of me, no
So breaking is the remedy
Love is our destiny, yeah
I'm in love with you, love with you
Love will save the world
Lo-Lo-Love will save the world
I'm in love with you, love with you
Love will save the world, umm
Lo-Lo-Love will save the world, yeah

We break all our rules
But they but they think they clever
(They think they clever, they think they clever, they think they clever)
They say hearts that speak a different language won't last forever

I'm living on the edge with the trivia, no
Maybe there's a love that's different
Opposites attract, opposites attract
Maybe I don't care, I'm giving up
But there's a dose of love I forgot
Opposites attract, opposites attract

When pain is the enemy
So this won't be the end of me, no
So breaking is the remedy
Love is our destiny, oh
I'm in love with you, love with you
Love will save the world

Love with you, love with you
Love with you, love with you
Love with you, love with you (ooh, yeah)
Love with you, love with you
Love with you, love with you
Love with you, love with you

(I never got to be the one you fight for)
No no no no
(No, I never gonna be the one)
The one you love, the one you love, the one you love
(No, I never got to be the one you cry for)
No no no no no

The one you love

When pain is the enemy
