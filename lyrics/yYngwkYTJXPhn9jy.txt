Will she love me again tomorrow?
I don't know, don't think so
And that's fine, fine by me
As long as, long as I know she's happy, happy
Without me
Without me
Without me
Without me
And will she find love again tomorrow?
I don't know, I hope so
And that's fine, fine by me
As long as, long as I know she's happy, she's happy
Without me
Without me
Without me
Without me
