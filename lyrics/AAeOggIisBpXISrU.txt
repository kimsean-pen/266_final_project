Her tears are never ending
You run away but stop pretending
Na na na na na, a girl like you
What do you think? Is it normal?
To go through life oh so formal?
Na na na na na, a girl like you

Weekends are never fun
Unless you're around here too
Weekends are never fun
Unless you're around here too

Head-on stars aligned
All the dreams are on my side
Na na na na na, a girl like you
Took her fall, so i felt down
Never wanna see anything
Na na na na na, a girl like you

Weekends are never fun
Unless you're around here too
Weekends are never fun
Unless you're around here too
