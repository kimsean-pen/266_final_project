Mood swing
Have another drink
What's that you said?
I see inside of you
Past the eyes and through

Sticks and stones
Lucky clover
This carousel's taking me home
Back of a taxi used
Ten more blocks to cruise, yeah yeah

Now that I'm home
Outside's in here
No longer aware of you
You created a space
I'll take my rocket ship
And get the hell out of this
Nothing that I could miss
You're killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me

Time, hurry
Heal my every wound
Don't burden me
Leave me to symphonies
I'm like a masterpiece

Gold beam
Dazzle every step
Time will bring
Sweet offering, brand new
Nothing there to lose
Yeah yeah

Now that I'm home
Outside's in here
No longer aware of you
You created a space
I'll take my rocket ship
And get the hell out of this
Nothing that I could miss
But you're killing me
Killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me

Now that I'm home
Outside's in here
No longer aware of you
You created a space
I'll take my rocket ship
I'll get the hell out of this
I'm making it in spite of how
Much you're killing me
