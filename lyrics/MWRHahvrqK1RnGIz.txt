It really breaks my heart to see a dear old friend
Go down to the worn out place again
Do you know the sound
Of a closing door
Have you heard that sound before
Do you wonder if she knows you anymore
I wrapped your love around me like a chain
But I never was afraid that it would die
You can dance in a hurricane
But only if you're standing in the eye
Where did you learn to walk
Where did you learn to run
Away from everything you loved
Did you think the bottle
Would ever ease your pain
Did you think that love's a foolish game
Did you find someone else to take the blame
I wrapped your love around me like a chain
But I never was afraid that it would die
You can dance in a hurricane
But only if you're standing in the eye
You can dance in a hurricane
But only if you're standing in the eye
I am a sturdy soul
And there ain't no shame
In lying down in the bed you made
Can you fight the urge to run for another day
You might make it further if you learn to stay
I wrapped your love around me like a chain
But I never was afraid that it would die
You can dance in a hurricane
But only if you're standing in the eye
You can dance in a hurricane
But only if you're standing in the eye
