Brother and sister
Together we'll make it through
Someday a spirit will lift you and take you there
I know you've been hurting
But I'll be there waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out
Whenever I can, 'cause

Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good

We all are a family that should stand together as one
Helping each other instead of just wasting time
Now is the moment to reach out to someone
It's up to you
When everyone's sharing their hope
The love will break through, 'cause

Everybody's free to feel good (yeah)
