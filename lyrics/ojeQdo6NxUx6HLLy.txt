Open to the fold
I chance the broken dust
Rights still known to us
Upon the open floor
Spread out pure you ask of me
My want is unknown
Begging for the answers now
I bathe in disgust
Your life is soon to end in pain
My comforting thoughts
Days have passed since you saw the stars
Tied down tight
Your life is soon to end in pain
Finally you begin to die
Die

My hands are red from the insides of you
Nothing will wash it off
I strangle your throat with my bloodsoaked hands
I've only one thought, is that you die

My hands are red from the insides of you
Nothing will wash it off
I strangle your throat with my bloodsoaked hands
I've only one thought, is that you die
Now

I must end you
Now
I must end you
Now

Reach out far for the pleasures of death
Watching you for what feels like years
First on my list you have little time left
The very first name, you were marked from the start

I will end you slowly
I will end you graciously
You will beg me eternally
I will end your life
For the pain you've caused

Mandatory butchery

I will end you slowly
I will end you graciously
You will beg me eternally
I've only one thought, is that you die
Now

I must end you
Now
I must end you
Now

My hands are red from the insides of you
Nothing will wash it off
I strangle your throat with my bloodsoaked hands
I've only one thought, is that you die
I strangle your throat with my bloodsoaked hands
I've only one thought, is that you die
Slow
In pain
Now
Fuckin' die
