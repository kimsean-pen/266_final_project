I don't even know the reason why
You tell me that it's time to say goodbye, yeah
You can't even look me in my eye
Did I do somethin' wrong?

If you tell me that the love is gone
I'll move over and I'll let you move on, yes
But I know that the love is still strong
So I keep holdin' on

So I'm never gonna let you go
Even though it's breakin' my heart
All I'm tryin' to do is let you know
We can make a new start, oh yeah

So I'm never gonna let you go
Even though it's tearin' me apart
All I'm tryin' to is let you know
We can make a new start

I remember back when we first met
The kind of love that you'd never forget
Makin' love 'till we were soakin' wet
And you're still on my mind, oh

After all the things that we've been through
You gotta give me time to talk to you
That's the very least that you can do
We can work it out with time

So I'm never gonna let you go
Even though it's breakin' my heart
All I'm tryin' to do is let you know
We can make a new start

So I'm never gonna let you go
Even though it's tearin' me apart
All I'm tryin' to do is let you know
We can make a new start

Whatever you want, I'll make it right
Whatever you need, I will provide
I really want you in my life
We can make a new start

Wherever you are, I will be there
The love that I give, none can compare
All that I have, I'll gladly share
We can make a new start

So I'm never gonna let you go
Even though it's breakin' my heart
All I'm tryin' to do is let you know
We can make a new start

So I'm never gonna let you go
Even though it's tearin' me apart
All I'm tryin' to do is let you know
We can make a new start
So I'm never gonna let you go
