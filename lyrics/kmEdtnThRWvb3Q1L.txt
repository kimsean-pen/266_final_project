I'll go, I'll go, I'll go wherever you go
And I will never leave without letting you know

Don't you give up on me
Don't you give up on me

We're told, we're told, we're told we'll never get old so don't you ever show them, show them our bones
We'll dig, we'll dig, we'll dig our own little hole, then put our walls around it and call it our home

Don't you give up on me
Don't you give up on me

'Cause you're all i got
And time won't stop.
