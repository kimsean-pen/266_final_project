There we are standing in the shooting stars,
in our houses in our cars
You didnt know it, now you do
this is the way we move
In the belly of the whale
In my bedroom I cant sleep
And all my friends got crooked tales
Thats the way I like it
Thats just what I need and
Chorus:
Here we are standing in the shooting stars
In our houses, in our cars
you didnt know it, now you do
this is the way, this is the way we move
In the belly of the whale
in my bedroom I cant sleep
and all my friends got crooked tales

Chorus:
Here we are standing in the shooting stars
In our houses, in the ashes, the bars
you didnt know it, now you do
it happens to be the way, the way you move
In the belly of the whale, in the belly of the beast
At the last supper honey,
Make sure you get something, something to eat
Here we are standing in the shooting stars
In our houses, in our cars
you didnt know it, now you do
This is the way, this is the way we move
This is the way, this is the way we move
This is the way, this is the way we move
This is the way
