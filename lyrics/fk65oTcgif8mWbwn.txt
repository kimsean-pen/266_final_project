Holding on to something that will never come back
Your childhood's gone and we're moving
Every moment will pass
And the dream you sold to pay for some romantic affair
Was the lie you told yourself when no one else was there

God knows all of the roads I've travelled
Lying lowly beneath the shadows
All the time wishing I was giving more...

More
You gotta give more
You gotta give more
To keep this dream alive
You gotta give more
You gotta give more
So we aren't left behind

So surreal
This kaleidoscoped reality
Wasted years
Trying to be something I'm not

Sick and tired of this mask I'm wearing
Tied and bound to a cross I'm bearing
All the time wishing I was giving more...

More
You gotta give more
You gotta give more
To keep this dream alive
You gotta give more
You gotta give more
So we aren't left behind
