Can't believe that I survived
I fell so hard, but I'm alive
Stood in front of the gates of Hell
With a glass of ice water in my hand

Praying at the edge of my bed
Get the fuck out of my head

Goodbye, graceful, I'm so grateful, I'm so grateful
You help to change my wicked ways when I was in my darkest days
And I'm so thankful that you were able, you were able
To save me from the burning flames, it made me who I am today
Oh

This dark cloud is still around
My thoughts wander in and out
And if I die before I wake
Tell the Devil I'm on my way

Praying at the edge of my bed
Get the fuck out of my head

Goodbye, graceful, I'm so grateful, I'm so grateful
You help to change my wicked ways when I was in my darkest days
And I'm so thankful that you were able, you were able
To save me from the burning flames, it made me who I am today

I've been running for the longest time
I forgot where I have left my mind, I have left my mind

Yeah, yeah
Goodbye, graceful, I'm so grateful you were able to have saved me

Goodbye, graceful, I'm so grateful, I'm so grateful
You help to change my wicked ways when I was in my darkest days
And I'm so thankful that you were able, you were able
To save me from the burning flames, it made me who I am today

Picking all the pieces of my life up off the floor
Searching for an open window or an exit door
This boulder on my shoulder, it got heavier and colder
Till the day that I got sober, now it's slowly rolling over
To all the people I've done wrong, now I apologize
To all the girls' hearts I broke, to the tears I made 'em cry
I know it's been a while, and you have traveled many miles
To get away, it's not my style, but I wrote this song to make you smile
Picking all the pieces of my life up off the floor
Searching for an open window or an exit door
This boulder on my shoulder, it got heavier and colder
Till the day that I got sober, now it's slowly rolling over
To all the people I've done wrong, now I apologize
To all the girls' hearts I broke, to the tears I made 'em cry
I know it's been a while, and you have traveled many miles
To get away, it's not my style, but I wrote this song to make you smile
