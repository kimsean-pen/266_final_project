It's a ghost town
Where I'm walking now
I'm all alone, I'm on the [?]
Where are you now?
Where are you right now?
You designed it
You built this town
You knocked down the walls
You picked these flowers
You moved it all around, you moved it all around
You moved it all around
What else can we do now?
Can I believe anything you say
Because you do anything you feel?
But you believe that this was love
Cause this is not how it should feel
So take your time as you go, take as much as you want
Cause once you're gone, please be gone
You designed it
You built this town
You knocked down the walls
You picked these flowers
You moved it all around, you moved it all around
You moved it all around
But all in all, I still need
Still need you now
But while you're gone
It won't be easy
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
(Calling your name, calling your name...)
Where are you now?
Where are you right now?
You designed it
You built this town
You knocked down the walls
You picked these flowers
You moved it all around, you moved it all around
You moved it all around
What else can we do now?
Can I believe anything you say
Because you do anything you feel?
But you believe that this was love
Cause this is not how it should feel
So take your time as you go, take as much as you want
Cause once you're gone, please be gone
You designed it
You built this town
You knocked down the walls

You moved it all around, you moved it all around
You moved it all around
But all in all, I still need
Still need you now

Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
Every night, I wake up
Calling your name, calling your name
(Calling your name, calling your name...)
