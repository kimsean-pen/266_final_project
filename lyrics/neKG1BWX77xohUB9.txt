I need a place
Need a taste
Need someone so whole and clean.

I need a spark
I need your spark
To light this house so dark and deep.

So call my name.
Call my name.

I lost my head
Lost my heart
Cast in iron it will heat.

I lost your name
Lost the shape
Of our bodies tangling.

And when I cry,
Do you cry?
I listen so ever quietly

For a sign
That my time
Is over and out of reach.

Even when you scolded me
I still felt it special.
Can feel it with my eyes closed
Laying in your tangles.

Speak up, calm me down
Be my novocaine.

Call my name
Even when I'm hurting
Do you feel the pain?

Swallowing
A part of me
There's a cooler side to everything

Pardon me
For offering
You can leave me with your eyes closed.

Even when you scolded me
I still felt it special.
Can feel it with my eyes closed
Laying in your tangles.

Lost you in a steady flow,
At least I thought so.

I need a place
Need a taste
Need someone so whole and clean.

I need a spark
I need your spark
To light this house so dark and deep.

So call my name.
Call my name.

I lost my head
Lost my heart
Cast in iron it will heat.

I lost your name
Lost the shape
Of our bodies tangling.

And when I cry,
Do you cry?
I listen so ever quietly

For a sign
That my time
Is over and out of reach
