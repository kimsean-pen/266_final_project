9 to 5 and 5 to 9
Ain't gonna take it, it's our time
We want the world and we want it now
We're gonna take it, anyhow
We want the airwaves

We want the airwaves
We want the airwaves
Baby, if rock is gonna stay alive
Oh yeah

Well, all right
Well, let's rock
Tonight, all night
Oh yeah
Well, all right
Well, let's rock

Tonight, all night, all night
Where's your guts and will to survive
And don't you wanna keep rock 'n' roll music alive
Mr. Programmer I got my hammer
And I'm gonna smash my, smash my radio
We want the airwaves
We want the airwaves
We want the airwaves

Baby, if rock is gonna stay alive
Oh yeah
Well, all right
Well, let's rock

Tonight, all night
Oh yeah
Well, all right
Well, let's rock
Tonight, all night, all night
We want the airwaves, airwaves
We want the airwaves, airwaves
We want the airwaves, airwaves
We want the airwaves, airwaves
We want the airwaves, baby
