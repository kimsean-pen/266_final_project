There's a fever, I can't leave you standing there
Honest, I swear, how could I walk you anywhere?
Oh, come home with me 'til your feeling sober
Your choice completely
You take the bed and I'll take the sofa

Crash, crash, crash
You can rash at mine tonight
I'll let you decide, oh you can
Crash, crash, crash, you can
Crash at mine, it's fine
If you decline
But you can
Crash, crash, crash, crash
Crash, crash, crash at mine

Late night, long drive, God knows how we both survive
Bright lights outside, on a ruin left behind
First impression, you mention not to knock your part
An exception, I don't do this all the time

Crash, crash, crash
You can rash at mine tonight
I'll let you decide, oh you can
Crash, crash, crash, you can
Crash at mine, it's fine
If you decline
But you can
Crash, crash, crash, crash
Crash, crash, crash at mine

Crash at mine

There's no pressure
Easy with whatever
Don't wanna leave you cold
There's no agenda
Only shelter from the night
Let's get inside, oh oh oh oh

Crash, crash, crash
You can rash at mine tonight
I'll let you decide, oh you can
Crash, crash, crash, you can
Crash at mine, it's fine
If you decline
But you can
Crash, crash, crash, crash
Crash, crash, crash at mine

Crash at mine
