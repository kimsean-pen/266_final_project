been round this road so many times
feel like its skin is part of mine
this taste of milk is almost gone
still got my shame, but not for long!
been wrong so many times before
but never quite like this
heard all, in the rain, but the rain all turned to mist

i hope to make it home one day
i doubt that day will come
i know you, know, ________
