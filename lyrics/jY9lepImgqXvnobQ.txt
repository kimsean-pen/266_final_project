This could have been just another day
But instead we're standing here
No need for words, it's all been said
In the way you hold me near
I was alone on this journey
You came along to comfort me
Everything I want in life is right here

'Cause this is not your ordinary, no ordinary love
I was not prepared enough
To fall so deep in love
This is not your ordinary, no ordinary love
You were the first to touch my heart
Made everything right again
With your extraordinary love
No no no, yeah

I get so weak when you look at me
I get lost inside your eyes
Sometimes the magic is hard to believe
But you're here before my weary eyes
You brought joy to my world
Set me so free, I want you to understand
You are every breath that I breathe

This is not your ordinary, no ordinary love
I was not prepared enough
To fall so deep in love
This is not your ordinary, no ordinary love
You were the first to touch my heart
Made everything right again
With your extraordinary love

From the very first time that we kissed
I knew that I just couldn't let you go at all
From this day on, remember this
That you're the only one that I adore
Can't we make this last forever
This can't be a dream
'Cause it feels so good to me

This is not your ordinary, no ordinary love
I was not prepared enough
To fall so deep in love
And this is not your ordinary, no ordinary love
You were the first to touch my heart
Made everything right again
With your extraordinary love

This is not your ordinary, no ordinary love
I was not prepared enough
To fall so deep in love
This is not your ordinary, no ordinary love
You were the first to touch my heart
