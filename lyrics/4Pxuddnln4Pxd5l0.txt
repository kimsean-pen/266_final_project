When the sirens call
Will you have no control?
So your heart it aches
Cause you were born without brakes
You were born without brakes
You were raised for a fall
Can you hear me now?
And you have no control

When the sirens call
Will you have no control?
So your heart it aches
Cause you were born without brakes
You were born without brakes
You were raised for a fall
Can you hear me now?
And you have no control

There's a golden age
Through the bars of your cage
Through a twist of fate
You became what you hate
Yeah you became what you hate
You gave into them all
Through a twist of fate
You will be sorry too late

Yeah you became what you hate
You gave into them all
Through a twist of fate
You will be sorry too late

Now I'm over you
Are you over me too?
Just a number now

Still I'm working it out
And I am working it out
I'm burning it up
But I'm over you
Are you over me too?

I'm working it out
I'm burning it up
But I'm over you
Are you over me too?

So sweet so cold
You must follow
It takes control

control

Yeah you became what you hate
You gave into them all
Through a twist of fate
You will be sorry too late

Yeah you became what you hate
You gave into them all
Through a twist of fate
You will be sorry too late
