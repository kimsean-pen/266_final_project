Do me a favor just keep me near.
Don't you remember when you said what I wanted to hear?
I'm not so clever, but I know it's real
If I left without you I don't know if I'd ever heal

Where are we now
you've got me thinkin'.
Where are we now

We're fallin' further from our love
Don't you wait
Don't you wait

From a distance we stopped tryin'
Don't you wait
Don't you wait

You could do better and I've tried to be clear
That I can be your friend, but that's not what you want to hear
Hey, I'm not your answer in time you'll see
That you have a future where you won't need to love me

And I'm leavin' now
I Gotta keep moving
And I'm leavin' now

We're fallin' further from our love
Don't you wait
Don't you wait

From a distance we stopped tryin'
Don't you wait
Don't you wait, andâ€”

I could have stayed there but it wouldn't be fair to you
I could have faked it but I couldn't see it through
We didn't make it, and it's better to start new

Yea, we're fallin' further from our love
Don't you wait
Wont you wait

From a distance we stopped tryin'
Don't you wait
Wont you wait
Wont you wait
Dont you- dont you wait
Wont you wait
Wont you wait
Dont you
Dont you
