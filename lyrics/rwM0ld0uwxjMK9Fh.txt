Where do we go?, nobody knows
I've gotta say I'm on my way down
God gave me style and gave me grace
God put a smile upon my face

Where do we go to draw the line?
I've gotta say, I wasted all your time, oh honey honey
Where do I go to fall from grace?
God put a smile upon your face, yeah

Nahh, when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I wanted to
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

Where do we go?, nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down, well
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face, oh yeah

Nahh, when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I wanted to
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
Where do we go?, nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down, well
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face
