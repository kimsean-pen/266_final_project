Where we grow
Home
All we know
All we've lost
All we know

Forced to fly away
What becomes
When we run home

Home

Out of the dark
Into the great unknown
We flow

Life passes by
Into the skies we soar
So fast

Out of the dark
Into the great unknown
We flow

Life passes by
Into the skies we soar
So fast

Home
So we called and left behind
To the vultures and their minds
Scavenge pieces as it died

What becomes
When we run
Home

All we've lost
All we've known

Out of the dark
Into the great unknown
We flow

Life passes by
Into the skies we soar
So fast

Out of the dark
Into the great unknown
We flow

Life passes by
Into the skies we soar
So fast

We flew high above the clouds,
only to come soaring down faster than we could have ever imagined
To lose the heart of all we loved,
to have the umbilical cord ripped away from our children

We are
When our love is over
What then will we be

When our love is over
What then will we be
Will we be

Drown us in a bottle
Fill us full of lead
Leave us to the bottle
To sink or drown instead
