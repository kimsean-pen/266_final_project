Mary is my best friend
She makes me my tea
She let me stay around her place
When there's nowhere else to be
There's nothin in her bedroom
Just a bed and TV
and it's OK if i'm not in her way
I just sit and drink my tea

I'm so Lonely
I 'aint done much
Lately
When you come lookin'
You'll find me
Sleeping
Soundly
Mary

Mary keeps me smilin'
Even when I'm down
She lets me stay around her place
When there's no-one else around
There's nothing in her bedroom
Just a bed and TV
and it's OK if i'm in her way
I just sit and drink my tea

I'm so lonely
I 'aint done much
Lately
When you come lookin'
You'll find me
Sleeping
Soundly

She lets me stay up late
But i cant stay awake
Oh no

(guitar solo)

I'm so lonely
I 'aint done much
Lately
When you come lookin'
You'll find me
Sleeping
Soundly
Mary
