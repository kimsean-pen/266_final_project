I am going away, I am going down
I am going away, I am going down

Sifting through a memory before it fades away
Adolescent secrecy, a million words astray

I can't remember happiness, I thrive within the dark
The security of a loneliness is a veil that keeps my calm

By the way, I'm doing fine
I have a place to stay, just behind the sunshine
And by the way, I don't need sympathy
I have a place to lay, I have more than you can see

I walk the streets alone at night, it helps to ease my mind
I lay me down come the morning light and leave all woes behind
