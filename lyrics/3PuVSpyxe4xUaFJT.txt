give me something to believe in
now that everything is dust
cool me down tell me it's ok
you won't see my face no more

making sense of your surroundings
eyes wide shut you start to dream
of a better life a better future
falling apart at the seems

give me something to believe in
now that everything is dead
empty hands lonely beds
i guess it's time to start again

walking out into the darkness
checking if you still exist
these misty lands lead me nowhere
forever lost forever sick
