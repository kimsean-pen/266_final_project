You are so beautiful
i just had to let you know
Youre what Im thinking of
Im addicted to your love

And youre always on my mind
I swear youre one of a kind
Youre a diamond in the rough
And I just cant get enough

Its something about you baby
Been thinking about you lately
Its something about you baby
I cant go without you baby
Its something bout you
Its something bout you

I dont know what to do
Im just so obsessed with you
The only thing I need
Its a sickness, a disease

And youre always on my mind
I swear youre one of a kind
Youre a diamond in the rough
And I just cant get enough

Its something about you baby
Been thinking about you lately
Its something about you baby
I cant go without you baby
Its something bout you
Its something bout you
