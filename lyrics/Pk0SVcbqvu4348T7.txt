I don't know if I know you all
but our blood and our battles still bind us
Why have you come and why have you brought our uninvited fears?

And I know faith can't help but fall
for our phantoms grow taller behind us
Can't even see the white skin of walls
They're far too many here
When will they leave me in peace?
When will they leave me in peace?

Nightly hours bemoan
while demons roam inside my home

Nightly hours bemoan
while demons roam inside
It's every time when I lay to rest
within these waves with a call for surrender
The quiet sun claims no aching steps

They're all still here
Nightly hours bemoan
Will tomorrow come with no one else, but me?
In this house of drums, they're all I hear and see

Don't let them ring the bell of age for me
Don't let them ring the bell with hearts debris
When the pale appears
their cries are enough to echo nightly skies
erase sunrise and cloud the clear
When the pale appears

their cries are enough to echo nightly skies
erase sunrise and cloud the clear

Nightly hours bemoan
while demons roam inside my home
Nightly hours bemoan
Will tomorrow come with no one else, but me?

In this house of drums, they're all I hear and see
Don't let them ring the bell of age for me
Don't let them ring the bell with hearts debris
Will tomorrow come with no one else, but me?
In this house of drums, they're all I hear and see
Don't let them ring the bell of age for me
Don't let them ring the bell with hearts debris
Don't let them ring the bell of age for me
Don't let them ring the bell with hearts debris
