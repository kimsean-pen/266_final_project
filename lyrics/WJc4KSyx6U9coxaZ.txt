Send me a sign, let me know
Give me a time, a place I should go
Reach inside, watch me grow
See me rise

Scene of the crime, star of the show
If you were mine then we would know
The peace of mind and seeds that we sow
Are intertwined

We almost made it
Making it is overrated

Scene of the crime, friend or foe
I got a body to hide, we've got a body on show
And with our bodies entwined we will know
Paradise

Scene of the crime, go with the flow
Take it fast, take it slow
Stay blind so I don't know
What's right

Our breath that berates before our rise
The ground beneath that shakes under our weight,
We almost made it,
Making it is overrated.

We almost made it

Making it is overrated

Making it is overrated
Making it is overrated
Making it is overrated
Making it is overrated
Scene of the crime!
