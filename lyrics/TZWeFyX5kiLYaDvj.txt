So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long

Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the takin', like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside, just climb, ooh

I am in the ground, I am in the air
I am all, I live in the hearts of men
I am the call to greatness, not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare

And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside

Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the takin', like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside, just climb, ooh

Oh, I have no fear, oh, death and glory
Oh, both draw near, like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside

Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside

Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside

Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
Na, na, na, na, na, na, oh, na, na, na, oh
