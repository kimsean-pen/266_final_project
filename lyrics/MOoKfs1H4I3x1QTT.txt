It's a dark time
Darker than all days before
Darker than all years before
It's a cold age
Colder than all days before
Colder than all years before

Taste a tide
Where landscapes surround
Us with blight
On the windrippled steps
The everflowing streams of
Our enemies
Blood runs cold

A strong ride
Stronger than all days before
Stronger than all years before

The might and pride
Mightier than all days before
Mightier than all years before

Come taste a tide
Where demons play the mind
On the windrippled steps
The everflowing streams of
Our enemies blood runs cold

Blow the horn for our
Tide to come
Triumph our battle be won

Battle all the lands
It's the triumph of the ages
Empires fall by my hands
In the triumph of the ages
Black demonic hordes
Journey against the earth
Coming from the north
Speeding on a gathering wind

It's a dark time
Darker than all days before
Darker than all years before
It's a cold age
Colder than all days before
Colder than all years before

Come taste a tide
Where landscapes surround
Us with blight
On the windrippled steps
The everflowing streams of
Our enemies
Blood runs cold
