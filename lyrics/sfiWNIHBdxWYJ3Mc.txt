We're standing here by the abyss
And the world is in flames
Two star-crossed lovers reaching out
To the beast with many names

He is
He's the shining and the light
Without whom I cannot see
And he is
Insurrection, he is spite
He's the force that made me be

He is
Nostro Dis Pater
Nostr' Alma Mater
He is

We're hiding here inside a dream
And all our doubts are now destroyed
The guidance of the morning stars
Will lead the way into the void

He is
He's the shining and the light
Without whom I cannot see
And he is
Insurrection, he is spite
He's the force that made me be
He is
Nostro Dis Pater
Nostr' Alma Mater
He is

He is
He's the shining and the light
Without whom I cannot see
And he is
Insurrection, he is spite
He's the force that made me be
He is
He's the shining and the light
Without whom I cannot see
And he is
The disobedience
That holds us together
He is
Nostro Dis Pater
Nostr' Alma Mater
And we are falling
Over the precipice
