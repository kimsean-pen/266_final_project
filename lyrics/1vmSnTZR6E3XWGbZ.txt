To dissect the mind impaled of visions a delusional
state from which one neglects
Incise the flesh with delicate precision
as to not disrupt such artistry

To dominate a feild of iniquity undeserving of many.
One must realize a painful demise deeds of tranquility.
Inflicting misery, an instrument of morbidity thrust deep on you.
Conflicted desires will transpire justify what's right.
Impaled upon a structure dear to you
Blood soaked hands drip insistently
Organs deemed venemous to you
Surgery of impalement

The blood drips from my hands
Your flesh is warm upon my face
Impaled with a collection of sickness
To desire that what you recieve

Impaled upon a structure dear to you
Blood soaked hands drip insistently
Organs deemed venemous to you
Surgery of impalement
