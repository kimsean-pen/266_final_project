I've been laying on the floor trying to keep cool
I've been licking off the dust trying 2 fool u
I've always struck myself as someone who's uncomfortable

I've been kissing at the ground watching the grass grow
I've been holding red balloons letting everyone go
I've always struck myself as someone who's impossible

Waving at the sky
I wanted to let go I didn't wanna say goodbye

I've been waking up early and staying out late
I've been losing control- I've been slipping away
I've always struck myself as someone who's an asshole

Waving at the sky
I wanted to let go I didn't wanna say goodbye
