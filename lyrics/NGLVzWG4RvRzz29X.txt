We're one in the same
Thinking the world's too easy
How has it changed
Did it end up above me
It's not my place
Pull me out of the ether

You've got a new face, pretty girl
I don't mind

Go ahead, tell me now what you like
Maybe this time I'll listen
Go ahead, tell me now what you like
Maybe this time

And all the pieces fall
When you smile back at me
Am I the cause
Or am I a poster child for pity
The empty space
Discolored walls painted over

You've found a new place in the world
That I can't find

Go ahead, tell me now what you like
Maybe this time I'll listen
Go ahead, tell me now what you like
Maybe this time

I've moved out the floor and
I'm down for the night
Please kill me before you
Tell me what you like
Don't waste a performance
Don't give it away
I just need an answer
What did you say

Go ahead, tell me now what you like
Maybe this time I'll listen
Go ahead, tell me now what you like
Maybe this time I'll listen
Go ahead, tell me now what you like
Go ahead, tell me now what you like
Go ahead, tell me now what you like
Maybe this time I'll listen
