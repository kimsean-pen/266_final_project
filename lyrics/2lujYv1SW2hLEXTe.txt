Zippin' up my boots
Goin' back to my roots, yeah
To the place of my birth
Back down to earth
I'm standing in the rain
Drenched and soaked with pain
Tired of short time benefits
And being exposed to the elements
I'm homeward bound
Got my head turned around
Ooh, ah
Zippin' up my boots
Goin' back to my roots, yeah
To the place of my birth
Back down to earth
Ain't talkin' 'bout no roots in the land
Talkin' 'bout the roots in the man
I feel my spirit's gettin' old
It's time to recharge my soul
I'm zippin' up my boots
Goin' back to my roots, yeah
To the place of my birth
Back down to earth
I'm homeward bound
Got my head turned around
Paua oouaarancÃ¬
IrÃ chiyeah
IshÃ© galÃ© ma ba oo ah
Paua oouaarancÃ¬
IrÃ chiyeah
IshÃ© galÃ© ma ba oo ah
Ooh, ah
Zippin' up my boots
Goin' back to my roots, yeah
To the place of my birth
Back down to earth
I'm homeward bound
Got my head turned around
Zippin' up my boots
Goin' back to my roots, yeah
To the place of my birth
Back down to earth
