Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?

When in this charming car
This charming man

Why pamper life's complexity
When the leather runs smooth
On the passenger seat?

I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear

This man said, "It's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"

A jumped-up pantry boy who never knew his place
He said, "Return the rings"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
This charming man
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
This charming man

Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
