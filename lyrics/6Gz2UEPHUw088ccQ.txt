If it's over now, maybe now i'm finally free
If it's over now, maybe now it's letting me be

Marie Curie don't believe in text book tragedy
I stepped on the lawn of some forbidden dawn
And declared myself so free

In the days of dust, I'm falling
Just like it's all over now
Days of dust, night calling
Just like it's all over now
Nothings what I'd expect to be
If I just wasted time
At least while I had it
Was mine

If it's over now
If it's over now

You know the moment when you walk out the door:
If you turn around (turn around!)
And your prison ain't there anymore

It felt like 20 years ago today
But still I can"t forget
I packed all my things and I went away
Lighter than a cigarette
In the days of dust
In the days of dust

...and like I had just been saved
From a burning building of desire
I got back up and I ran right into the fire

In the days of dust, it's over now
In the days of dust, it's over now

If it's over now
Then maybe it was meant to be
Then maybe it was meant to be
