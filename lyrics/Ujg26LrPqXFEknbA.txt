i've got a head with wings
i got a head with wings,
i got a head with wings
and i can see so far away i can see so clear
you would not believe the view up here
i got a head with wings, a head with wings

now im floating around up here way above the clouds
so high above the ground
and the only thing that holds my head to the ground
is this one little skinny string
i got a head with wings, head with wings
i got a head with yea oh
a head with wings

i got a head with wings
i got a head with wings
i got a head with wings

and i can see so far away yes so far away
well i can see the shadows fall across your face

i got a head with wings
head with wings
i got a head with yea yea
a head with wings
a head with wings
yea yea
