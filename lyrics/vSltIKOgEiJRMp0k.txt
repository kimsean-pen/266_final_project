I'm out cruising in the desert, it feels so fucking great
The coolest pleasure is to ride in, my mustang, my mustang 68
I'm running out of fuel
I'm running out of gas

My babe's in the backseat now
I'm on the top of the world
Four litres of whiskey makes us neat,
and doubles our crops of feat
I'm running out of fuel
I'm running out of gas
