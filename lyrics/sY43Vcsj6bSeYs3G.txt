Inhale your own worst obssession
Forgive me mother
Inhale, forget the one you're waiting for the adversary

Accusation
The last fall is endless
Await the blade upon your tiny chest

I miss an existence I don't even know
My addiction
I've seen the universe in your eyes
I've seen the beauty that never dies
Mother

Mother Anorexia engraves my veins
There's blood and anger all under my nails

Mother Anorexia, my hope was fake
Mother Sephirah, they never existed
Mother Anorexia

I miss a sacrifice
No weakness,
No instinct,
No vileness

I've seen the angels prostitute
I've seen my loss so cute
I've seen the universe in your eyes
I've seen the beauty that never dies
Mother

I live in fear
I hate myself
Wanna make love with myself
While cutting deep inside my flesh

Shallow's your own worst deception
Betray me mother
Swallow and kill the one you believe you love

The way to your perfect immolation
The last fall is endless
Await my hand upon your offered breasts

Now your embrace the no one can take, the never, the always
A colder fear...
Poison's getting closer to me

So pure innocent child
Untouchable, virgin like
Not as dark as I thought it was.
