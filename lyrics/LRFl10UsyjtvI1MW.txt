there is a shadow floating over me
growing to a vast crimson cloud
meanings are blurred
calm and harm in disorder
my eyes blinded for what is real

noone there to drag me out of here
noone there to stop me from drowning

the circle of fear
is always present
no escape from my inner emptiness
forever running in circles
---away from myself
i hear your voice in the distance
the fire drags me further down the spiral,
tears a silent scream out of me

crawling up and down the walls
of my cold and empty room
the ceiling collapses on me
a place full of mirrors
pitiless reflecting my deficiency

chasing my own tail
my own murderer
death means exit
-death means fear
just fade into oblivion

the circle of fear
is always present
no escape from my inner emptiness
forever running in circles
---away from myself
i hear your voice in the distance
the fire drags me further down the spiral,
tears a silent scream out of me

a paranoid knife
teaching me with pain
hurting me with fear
killing me with memories

i will eat myself alive
devoured by my fear
spit out my inside

the circle of fear
is always present
no escape from my inner emptiness
forever running in circles
---away from myself
i hear your voice in the distance
the fire drags me further down the spiral,
tears a silent scream out of me
