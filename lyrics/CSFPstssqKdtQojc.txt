Stay up
If I was to be afraid
Would you wait up
If I was to feel alone?

If we're gonna, if we're gonna do this right
Everybody sees it's true
If you're gonna lead me there
And I know, and I know you're going to

I'll let you sleep
Forget about it all
Another day is done
'Til we work it out

I'll let you sleep
Leave it all behind
'Cause no one taught us how
To work it out

Were you thinkin' of me like I thought
I'm so far away
Won't you come and hold my heart?

If we're gonna, if we're gonna do this right
Everybody sees it's true
If you're gonna lead me there
And I know, and I know you're going to

I'll let you sleep
Forget about it all
Another day is done
'Til we work it out

I'll let you sleep
Leave it all behind
'Cause no one taught us how
To work it out

If we're gonna, if we're gonna do this right

And I'll
Stand on the
Back of your...
Feel the wind on
Our skin
Covered up
Watch the light
Guide us home

I'll let you sleep
Forget about it all
Another day is done
'Til we work it out

I'll let you sleep
Leave it all behind
'Cause no one taught us how
To work it out

Work it out
