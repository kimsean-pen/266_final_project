I hunt, I hide, I run
I hunt, I hide, and I run
I hunt and I hide, I hide
I hunt and I hide
And I run

I hunt, I hide, I run
I hunt, I hide, and I run
I hunt and I hide, I hide
I hunt and I hide
And I run

Stop looking at me with a gun in your hand
Stop looking at me with a gun in your hand
Stop looking at me with a gun in your hand
Stop looking at me with a gun in your hand
Stop looking at me with a gun in your hand
Stop looking at me with a gun in your hand
