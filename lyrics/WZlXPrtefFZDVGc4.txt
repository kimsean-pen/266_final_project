Sometimes you misunderstood
The way I see it, don't do no good
Sometimes you can't raise no help
Wind up ahead of yourself

I swear I get so tired of aggravation
Believe me baby, it's nowhere, nowhere

The same old thing
The same old thing
I just wanna shut it down, shut it down

On your feet or on your knees
You're only shooting the breeze
Words are cheap and talk is free
Turns out to be a rabbit with me

I'm gonna ace you out, no more confusion
Begin to make me nervous, nervous

The same old thing
The same old thing
I just wanna shut it down, shut it down

I don't think you understand
Ain't no-one holding your hand
You're only skin and bone
You're born broke and you die alone

Free rides are over now, no more Mr. Nice Guy
Believe me baby it's over, over

The same old thing
The same old thing
I just wanna shut it down, shut it down
