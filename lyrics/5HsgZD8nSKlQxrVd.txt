It's been 7 hours and 13 days
Since u took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since u took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want

I can see who ever I choose
Eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant, oh yeah
But nothing, nothing can take away these blues
Nothing compares, nothing compares 2 u

Oh baby

It's been so lonely without u here

I'm like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop this lonely rain from falling
Tell me baby, where did I go wrong?
Oh baby

I can put my arms around every boy I see, oh yeah
But they only remind me of u
All my dames remind me of u too girl, oh yeah

I went 2 the doctor, guess what he told me

What'd he tell u?
Guess what he told me

I'm listening
He said, "Rosie,"

What?
"Try to have fun no matter what u do"

U wanna tell me why?
He's a fool

Nothing compares (no), nothing compares 2 u

Ooh, baby
Tenor man, play it for me
All the flowers that u planted, sugar
In the backyard all died when u went away
Ooh baby, I know that living with me baby
Is sometimes hard, sometimes hard
But I'm willing, I'm willing 2 give it one more try
One more try
Please do you know why, do you know why
Nothing compares (no), nothing compares 2 u
Oh, baby
Everytime I say...
Nothing compares (no), nothing compares 2 u
