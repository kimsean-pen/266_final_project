The kids in the hundreds tomorrow will march through the door
They're fighting someone else's war
They'll have so many stories to tell
In exchange for a hero's farewell

I wish I could, I wish I could make you return
And what if I'll never discern
As you walk to the toll of the bell
You'll be fighting for our Heaven with Hell

And you don't understand why no one else can see

Your blood on me
And my blood on you
But to make you bleed
The only thing I wouldn't do

And you know, heroes aren't meant to survive
So much harder to love when alive
Broke with the devil in your head
You would think you were better off dead

And you don't understand why no one else can see

Your blood on me
And my blood on you
But to make you bleed
The only thing I wouldn't do

Where can you go?
Fighting, fighting, fighting
Where can you go?
Fighting, fighting, fighting

We fight, we earn, we never learn
And through it all the hero falls

I wish there was a way to give you a hand to hold
'Cause you don't have to die in your glory, die to never grow old

Your blood on me
And my blood on you
But to make you bleed
The only thing I wouldn't do

Your blood on me
And my blood on you
But to make you bleed
The only thing I wouldn't do

Where can you go?
Fighting, fighting, fighting
Where can you go?
Fighting, fighting, fighting

We fight, we earn, we never learn
And through it all the hero falls
