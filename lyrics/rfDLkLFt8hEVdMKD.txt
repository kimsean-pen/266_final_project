I was a human, breathing and thinking
Eating and drinking, philosophizing
I was a human, before you killed me
And ripped my heart out, I knew what love was

Now when they ask me, I just reply slow
And sound like an iPhone
I do not know love, I am a robot, ba ba ba ba bam bada ba
I do not know love, I am a robot, ba ba ba ba bam bada ba
I used to know love

Cause I had a fire, passion and desire
Now all I require are circuits and wires
Inside was an ocean of soul and emotion
Then you cut me open, now all that I know is

I am a robot, thoughtless and empty
Don't know who sent me, don't know who made me
Electric robot, everything's gray now
Numb to the pain now, I knew what love was

Now when they ask me, I just reply slow
And sound like an iPhone
I do not know love, I am a robot, ba ba ba ba bam bada ba
I do not know love, I am a robot, ba ba ba ba bam bada ba
I used to know love

Cause I had a fire, passion and desire
Now all I require are circuits and wires
Inside was an ocean of soul and emotion
Then you cut me open, now all that I know is

I am a robot, I am a robot
I used to know love
Cause I had a fire, passion and desire
Now all I require are circuits and wires
Inside was an ocean of soul and emotion
Then you cut me open, now all that I know is

I am a robot
