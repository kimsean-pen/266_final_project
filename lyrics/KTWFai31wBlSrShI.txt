It's amour before we're lost
we test our peace
it's your privateness that taunts
right next to me
taste this fatal avalanche
a monster me
then I fade just like violence
falling, passing, breathe.

With your hounds and wolves
carry me to the sea
give your thousand wounds to me

Maybe we're water and this is all salt
though it never happened it tears us apart, apart
and in that light I cast alone
it feels like I was slipping off
with devils

With your hounds and wolves
carry me to the sea
give your thousand wounds to me

With your hounds and wolves
carry me to the sea
give your thousand wounds to me

Your love is an island
I'm scorched in the sands of it...
