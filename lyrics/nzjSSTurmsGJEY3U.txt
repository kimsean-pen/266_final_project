Riddle me this, I gotta figure it out
Are they laughing at me
Because I'm prone to fear and doubt
Am I messed up, am I loud
Well eat my dust, that's all I am a speck out in the crowd
I'm trying to clean up the mess I made
But the towel I used to soak up my worry, it just went up in flames
You see I got a conscience like gasoline
I could siphon shit out, fuck it and leave
But, I fuel the fire with everything they say it's stuck in my mind
You're better off dead
If you got the keys then start the car and
Drive as far as you can
If you got the blood then you got the heart to
Give yourself a chance
Seems like we've been so scarred
Some people call it art
I hope you make peace with your pain
And never lose your flames

Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I will live to my fullest because I owned my name the best I could
How much does it hurt?
To live like we live like everybody else
Or am I better off dead
Feeling like I'm nothing's something that I'm getting used to
Trying to devise a plan that's positively fool proof
Nobody can see me past these walls that I've been building
Now it's starting to cave in but I won't give up
If you got the keys then start the car and
Drive as far as you can
If you got the blood then you got the heart to
Give yourself a chance
Seems like we've been so scarred
Some people call it art
I hope you make peace with your pain
And never lose your flames

Feeling like I'm nothing's something that I'm getting used to
Wanting to fit in, I always wanted to be perfect to you
I gotta get up out this bed
If you can see inside my head, you understand I got to give up
Feeling like I'm nothing's something that I'm getting used to
trying to devise a plan that's positively fool proof
nobody can see me past these walls that I've been building
Now it's starting to cave in but I won't give up

If you got the keys then start the car and
Drive as far as you can
If you got the blood then you got the heart to
Give yourself a chance
Seems like we've been so scarred
Some people call it art
I hope you make peace with your pain
And never lose your flames
