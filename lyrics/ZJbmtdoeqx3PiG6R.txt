Runnin' hot, runnin' cold
I was runnin' into overload
It was extreme

I took it so high, so low
So low, there was nowhere to go
Like a bad dream

Somehow the wires uncrossed, the tables were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn

I'm feelin' good from my head to my shoes
Know where I'm goin' and I know what to do
I tidied up my point of view
I got a new attitude

I'm in control, my worries are few
'Cause I've got love like I never knew
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I got a new attitude

I'm wearing a new dress, new hair
Brand new ideas, as a matter of fact
I've changed for good

It must have been the cool night
New moon, new slight change
More than to figure, but I feel like I should, yes

Somehow the wires uncrossed, the tables were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn

I'm feelin' good from my head to my shoes
Know where I'm goin' and I know what to do
I tidied up my point of view
I got a new attitude

I'm in control, my worries are few
'Cause I've got love like I never knew
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I got a new attitude
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Somehow the wires uncrossed, the tables were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn

I'm feelin' good from my head to my shoes
Know where I'm goin' and I know what to do
I tidied up my point of view
I got a new attitude

I'm in control, my worries are few
'Cause I've got love like I never knew
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I got a new attitude

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I got a new attitude
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I got a new attitude
