Drag your shadow down the street
Is it you I was to meet?
With your saints there on a chain
Waiting on another rain

And I going down.
Where the waves will surround
To the roar and the pound
Of the wild wild sea,
Talking sweet to me.

Marching in a slow parade
There are ashes where you lay
And sometimes I don't mind at all
And sometimes head against the wall
The tide will bring and tide will take
Find another horse to break
Your just a rider on a wheel
in a dream where love was real

And I going down.
Where the waves will surround
To the roar and the pound
Of the wild wild sea,
Talking sweet to me.
