Dreamer by LUCIFER
Any time coming sun (?)
Morning comes I began lot of these unrise
Dreamer
Oh dreamer
What have you done with your light
Dreamer
Oh dreamer
Have you come to realise

You got it all in my return
It's Just another life along
Your gonna (?)
Dreamer how do you seen her
On the wild horse (?) I've turned to the sky

Any time coming sun I (?)
Morning comes I began lot of these unrise
Dreamer
Oh dreamer
What have you done with your light
Dreamer
Oh dreamer
Have you come to realise

You get it all in my return
It's just another life alone
(?)
Dreamer how do you seen her
On the wild horse (?) I've turned to the sky
Dreamer how do you seen her
On the wild horse (?) I've turned to the sky

Any time coming sun I (?)
Morning comes I began lot of these unrise
Morning sun comes along shine other light

Dreamer
Oh dreamer
What have you done with your light

You get it all in my return
It's just another life alone

Dreamer how do you seen her
On the wild horse (?) I've turned to the sky
Dreamer how do you seen her
On the wild horse (?) I've turned to the sky
