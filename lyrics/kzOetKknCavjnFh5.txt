Nobody knows who I am,
maybe you would understand,
Anybody knows what I am,
out in a secret land,
Nobody knows how I try
not to tell another lie,
Anybody knows, in the end
I'll find a secret land...

I remember,
Leaves were falling down in St. Germain,
It was a cold November,
You went away and I can't dream.

I need you, I feel you,
I can't live without you so long...
And I know that we parted,
I'll stay in this town 'cause I miss you so...

I feel it, I mean it,
The secret that I'm gonna show...
And I turn back, I see that
All my love had to fail but I miss you so...

Nobody knows who I am,
maybe you would understand,
Anybody knows what I am,
out in a secret land,
Nobody knows how I try
not to tell another lie,
Anybody knows, in the end
I'll find a secret land...
I'll find a secret land...

Nobody knows who I am,
maybe you would understand,
Anybody knows what I am,
out in a secret land,
Nobody knows how I try
not to tell another lie,
Anybody knows, in the end
I'll find a secret land...

Nobody knows who I am,
maybe you would understand,
Anybody knows what I am,
out in a secret land,
Nobody knows how I try
not to tell another lie,
Anybody knows, in the end
I'll find a secret land...
I'll find a secret land...

Nobody knows who I am,
maybe you would understand,
Anybody knows what I am,
out in a secret land,
Nobody knows how I try
not to tell another lie,
Anybody knows, in the end
I'll find a secret land...
