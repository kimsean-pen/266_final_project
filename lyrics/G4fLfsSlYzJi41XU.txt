A neon light is seen
Above every average teen
A sign spelling out a word
That none of us has ever heard

Fourteen bucks today and I get a new life tomorow
A new product rejects unhappy moments and sorrow
I'll take this one and that one and then some more
I'll use a piece of paper and the almighty pen

Here we go again
A voice inside of me
Says insufficiency
How come it worked out for you?
I better try something new

Fourteen bucks today and I get a new life tommorow
A new product rejects unhappy moments and sorrow
I'll take this one and that one and then some more
I'll use a piece of paper and the almighty pen

Not satisfied just yet
Want to recieve and get
I believe that word
My inner voice is never left unheard

Fourteen bucks today and I get a new life tomorow
A new product rejects unhappy moments and sorrow
I'll take this one and that one and then some more
I'll use a piece of paper and the almighty pen
Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go go go again
