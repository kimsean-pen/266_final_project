Honestly, I believe in you
Do you trust in me
Patiently, I will stand by you
I will stand beside you faithfully

And through the years
I will be a friend
For always and forever

Call on me and I'll be there for you
I'm a friend who always will be true
And I love you can't you see
That I can say I love you honestly

Call on me and I'll be there for you
I'm a friend who always will be true
And I love you can't you see
That I love you honestly
And will never betray your trust in me
And I love you can't you see
That I can say I love you honestly
