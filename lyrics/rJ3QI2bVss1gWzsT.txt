I should have known you'd always scratch that itch
When you asked for safe passage
On my shoulders where we slid

And just before you laid dead weight upon its shores
I stung you in the face
For that's the nature of my core

Because
I got distance, don't let it close
Gotta let me know
You just gotta let me know

Because
Forget which way is out now
Gotta let me know
You just gotta let me know

I'm nowhere near this place you wear
It's unforgivable
It knows that I am visible
I'm broken mirrors and useless prayer
This lock is healing me
You know you came so willingly

Waiting is a vessel that will take me to
Love, it knows no order
When you taste the truth

Because
I'm trapped in this cement husk
Gotta let me go
You just gotta let me go

Because
I paid with my own touch now
I brought a little cut
There is blood for every month

In the way you used to call her wicked answers
Time is a plague
There's no time in this place

If you don't
If you don't let me go
Heaven's made a cesspool of us all

I'm nowhere near this place you wear
It's unforgivable
It knows that I am visible
I'm broken mirrors and useless prayer
This lock is healing me
I know you came so willingly

There burns a kiss with serpent scales
There is no miracle
I lost your miracle
I'm nowhere near this place you wear
It's unforgivable
It knows that I am visible

And I wrap myself around your buried question
Through the blisters of confinement
And I seek to drain this broken shelter
To refill the pigment case that I have left

Don't stay long
For teeth nurse the first wound
Coats revolve
Hope to gain

What if we find
What tongue ties Double-Windsor?
Invoke to no reply

Those that lie
Have froze at the border
No implies
Close the frame

What if we find
The sunlight draws a curtain?
Invoke to no reply

There's a place where this depth charge ignites
In this place where a soul has no purpose
I can't believe you when your ghost won't let me go
I am the moment you were always speaking of because there's...

No fence will hold the sentient
Culprit fall about it
Say when I can enter them
Culprit fell about it
One fell, the other taste won't lie
Make no doubt about it

How many blame?
How many cave into the pressure I apply?
How many blame?
How many cave into the pressure I apply?
(If you take this breath of mine)...
How many blame?
How many cave into the pressure I apply?
How many blame?
How many cave into the pressure I apply?
