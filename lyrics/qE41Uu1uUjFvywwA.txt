Goodbye Thompson, goodbye
I tape the sign to the door
Here we pinned all our dreams
Now the store is no more
What comes after what was
That was once strangely new
What awaits up ahead
For me and you?
Goodbye Thompson
Goodbye Thompson
Goodbye Thompson
Goodbye Thompson, goodbye
Goodbye Thompson, goodbye
Goodbye Thompson, goodbye
This space is for rent
See me head hanging low
All my energies spent
What comes after what was
That was once strangely new
What awaits up ahead
I wish I knew
Goodbye Thompson
Goodbye Thompson
Goodbye Thompson
Goodbye Thompson, goodbye
Goodbye Thompson, goodbye
What comes after what was
That was once strangely new
What awaits up ahead
For me and you
Goodbye Thompson
