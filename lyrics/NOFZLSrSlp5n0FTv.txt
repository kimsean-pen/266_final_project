Like a foam in an antique bath,
White snow has covered my head
I am slow slow slow slow slowly dying,
My blue colored eyes are almostly blind
And I see, huge walls of trees,
Huge walls of ice shelves
It takes my breathe away
If everyone is falling on knees,
I will almost die for this beauty
She touched me, my heart was beating too
fast
She walked close to me, my heart was beating
too fast
How it feels, cold arms on me, hot blood in
my chest,
I've done everything I can
If everyone is falling on knees,
I will almost die for this beauty
Everyone is falling on knees,
And I see, huge walls of trees,
Huge walls of ice shelves
It takes my breathe away
If everyone is falling on knees,
I will almost die for this beauty
Everyone is falling on knees,
Everyone is falling
