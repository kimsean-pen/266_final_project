They don't know we're talking about walking to the end
And no one cares
They're occupied
With their own lives

They don't know what happened the last time we fell
There were so many pieces
Hey, don't you need this?
Oh, that's when you said I could keep it
No, now your heart is mine, I need it
And leave, I'm leaving
Let's go, 'cause I'm tired of moving slow

That's why I'm never ever
Never ever never never
Ever let you go the wrong way
Pain don't last forever it's just a long day
Never ever ever
We share a heart
You close your eyes
I'm in the dark
Never ever let you go
There's no way
I'll ever let you go
No no no, no
I'll never let you go, oh no

Yeah I hear 'em talking about us once again
I don't care
I'm occupied
With you and I

They don't know what happened the last time I fell
There were so many pieces
Hey, don't you need this?
Oh, I told you now you can keep it, yeah
Your heart is mine, I need it
If you leave I'm leaving
Let's go, 'cause I'm tired of moving slow, slow

That's why I'm never ever
Never ever never never
Ever let you go the wrong way, okay
Pain don't last forever it's just a long day (mhm)
Never ever ever (oh)
We share a heart (share a heart)
You close your eyes (close your eyes)
I'm in the dark
Never ever let you go
There's no way
I'll ever let you go

No, no, no (Never ever let you go)
I'll never let you go (Never ever let you go)
Never let you go, I could never let you go (I'll never let you go)
(Never ever let you go)
Never let you (Never ever let you go)
No, no, no, no (Never ever let you go)
No, no, no, no (Never ever let you go)

Hang on (Never ever let you go), hang on me (Never ever let you go)
Hold on (Never ever let you go), hold on me
Won't you hang on?
Hang on (hang on), hang on me (hang on me)
Hold on, hold on me
Hang on
