Come the day
You see the sun
Hit the arch
A history song

If you don't know it now then you will do
If you don't know it now then you will do

A ship across
The estuary
Sundays lost
In melancholy

If you don't know it now then you will do
If you don't know it now then you will do

A storm of strings
Far away
The hangers on
Saved the day

If you don't know it now then you will do
If you don't know it now then you will do
And if you don't feel it now then you will do
And if you don't feel it now then you will do

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
