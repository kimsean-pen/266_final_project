Gotta face the music
These things I've done
I can't forget
I've come to win
But I lose it
Now look at me;
What you see is what you get
You better take your heart away from me

This is my love, helplessly fading
Doing everything I can to lose a little bit
Of myself tonight, hopelessly waiting
For the storm to lead me home
'Cause I can never walk away from a fight
All of my life, running on wild
Trying to escape it
This is my love, helplessly fading
Always waiting
Always waiting

I've come to say I'm sorry
(So sorry)
Far too many times to tell
It's never like in the stories
(Oh, I tried)
But I could not catch you when you fell
If you give yourself
I'll take everything you got

This is my love, helplessly fading
Doing everything I can to lose a little bit
Of myself tonight, hopelessly waiting
For the storm to lead me home
'cuz I could never walk away from the fight
[?}
Trying to escape it
This is my love, helplessly fading
Always waiting
Always waiting

(Keep waiting keep, keep waiting)
Living in a love song, yeah
(Keep waiting keep, keep waiting)
Will it be the right one?
(keep waiting keep, keep waiting)
Living in a love song, oooh oh

This is my love, helplessly fading
Doing everything I can to lose a little bit
Of myself tonight, hopelessly waiting
For the storm to lead me home
'cuz I could never walk away from the fight
Trying to escape it
This is my love, helplessly fading
Always waiting
