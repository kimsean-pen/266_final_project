You're not doing this alone
You're not doing, you're not doing this alone

For my sweetheart the melancholic
You have crossed the River Styx
And the waves have taken you away

As I lay my head on your chest
I can hear it in your veins
Wake me up when you come to bed

So toughen up
Biko, toughen up
Biko, toughen up
This world isn't kind to little things
You're not doing this alone

Was my love not strong enough to
Bring you back from the dead?
If I could eat your cancer I would but I can't
You're not doing this alone

So I've been writing these songs for you
To steal you from your grave
We can dance in a front row again

So toughen up
Biko, toughen up
Biko, toughen up
I need you to be strong for us

So toughen up
Biko, toughen up
Biko, toughen up
This world isn't kind to little things
You're not doing this alone

Don't you know that when you stand
You stand up for the both of us?
Remember that when the darkness looms
You're not doing this alone

Every tear you shed is cleansing
Taking the pain away from you
I left you blueberries in the fridge
The little things that I can do

So toughen up
Biko, toughen up
(That I can do)
Biko, toughen up
(That I can do)
I need you to be strong for us

So toughen up
Biko, toughen up
Biko, toughen up
This world isn't kind to little things

You're not doing this alone, you're not doing this alone
You're not, you're not doing this alone
You're not doing this alone, you're not doing this alone
You're not doing this alone, you're not doing
You're not doing this alone

Resist, resist
Resist, resist

So toughen up
(Resist)
Biko, toughen up
(Resist)

Biko, toughen up
(Resist)
I need you to be strong for us
(Resist)

So toughen up
(Resist)
Biko, toughen up
(Resist)

Biko, toughen up
(Resist)
This world isn't kind to little things
(Resist)

You're not doing this alone
You're not doing, not doing this alone
