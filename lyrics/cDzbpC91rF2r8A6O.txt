Somewhere in a lonely hotel room
There's a guy starting to realize
That he's eternal fate has turn it's back on him
It's two A.M.

It's two a.m. (It's two a.m.)
The fear has gone (The fear has gone)
I'm sittin' here waitin' (I'm sittin' here waitin')
The gun is still warm (The gun is still warm)
Maybe my connection is tired of takin' chances

Yeah, there's a storm on the loose
Sirens in my head
Wrapped up in silence, all circuits are dead
Cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy

Help, I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
Place is a madhouse
Feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far (whoa, oh, oh)

Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse
Feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far

Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

I'm falling down a spiral
Destination unknown
Double-crossed messenger all alone
Can't get no connection, can't get through
Where are you?
Well the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind
This far from the borderline
When the hit man comes
He knows damn well he has been cheated
And he says,

Help, I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
Place is a madhouse
Feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far (ooh, whoa, oh)

Help, I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
Place is a madhouse
Feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far

Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone

Help, I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
Place is a madhouse
Feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far(ooh-whoa)

Help, I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
Place is a madhouse
Feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far

Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

When the bullet hits the bone, uh, huh, huh
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone, uh, huh, huh
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone, uh, huh, huh
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone, uh, huh, huh
When the bullet hits the bone
