We had a rainy day
I'm in a snake back situation.
Here's a pencil pad
I'm gonna spread some information.
You, making me happier
Now I am snappier, while I'm with you.
I, got to be heavier
'Cos I am happier, when I make you.
You're my little symphonia
I get a dark blue ring
I get a snapback raincoat.
I get a purple sting, ('cos he is in tune).

These are the whistlecat, (singing the hours).
Along the frosty roadside, (always in time).
I get a-nother ring, (making me happy).
That will take me for another ride, (up in the sky).

Oh, Heaven is in her...
(That is why, she moves, the highs).

You, making me happier
Now I am snappier, while I'm with you.
I, got to be heavier
'Cos I am happier, when I make you.

Inside a dream stone, (dreaming's in and out of style)
I found an eighty park system(?)
(Dreaming for the other half, so I can get on down).
Out in the country fields smiling, (jumping, laughing, having fun)
I feel the love of a pretty sun, shining on me.
Jumping, laughing, smiling, having fun.
Jumping, laughing, smiling, having fun.
Laughing, smiling, loving, get on down.
Smiling, laughing, loving, get on down.
