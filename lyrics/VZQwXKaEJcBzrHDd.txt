We've got something kinda funny goin' on
(we've got it, yeah, hey, eh)
We've got something kinda funny goin' on
Wherever you're going, high or low
Remember to sure enjoy the show
So climb [harmony] aboard my journey deep inside
Better late [harmony] than dead on time
(Oooh) It's you I know that I have got to feed [harmony] yeah, yeah

More than you really need [harmony]
We've got something kinda funny goin' on (we've got it)
We've got something kinda funny goin' on (we've got it)
(Ooh)
Happiness is just a state of your mind
Keep searching who knows what you may find
Rules are for fools, and fool's paradise is hard to find
Play my game or get left behind
(Oooh) It's you I know that I have got to feed, yeah, yeah [harmony]
