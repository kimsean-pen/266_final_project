Another hot summer's day
And only we know the way
To the cool blue lagoon
Where we sleep until noon

The city is all ablaze
With blue notes and haze
We hit the open wide roads
Snuck the moon in clothes

Give up to the moon
Give up today
Give up to the moon

We swim under the moon
In the cool blue lagoon
You count up all my scars
Crumble them into stars
Your such a perfect mess
You and your dirty white dress
And the day I came to

Give up to the moon
Give up today
Give up to the moon
Give up today

Perfect moon we relent
You said to drink and we sip
We smoke flowers rising high
Under the famous sky

Give up to the moon
Give up today
Give up to the moon
Give up today
