You could be my dirty secret (I could be yours)
We could only be a rumor (Never be sure)
You could meet me in the backseat (late night?)
Or take it up in first class (Mile high)

Cause hey baby baby you got me so, so good

Cause hey baby baby I got it so, so bad
Think you're all about me
But I'm all about you
Turn the lights down, let me show you it's true
Get a little taste of what I'm into
Think you're all about me
But I'm all about you
You

I don't wanna keep a secret (No, no, no more)
This is more than just a little thing (Baby for sure)
I can't wait until the next time (We meet)
Gonna kiss you in the daylight (Out in the beach)

Cause hey baby baby you got me so, so good
Hey baby baby I got it so, so bad

Think you're all about me
But I'm all about you
Turn the lights down, let me show you it's true
Get a little taste of what I'm into
Think you're all about me
But I'm all about you, yeah
Think you're all about me
But I'm all about you
You, yeah
Think you're all about me
But I'm all about you

Midnight eyes, oh you came as a surprise
You were right on time

Think you're all about me
But I'm all about you
(Hey, oohh)
Think you're all about me
But I'm all about you
(Hey, oohh)
Think you're all about me
But I'm all about you

Think you're all about me
But I'm all about you
Turn the lights down, let me show you it's true
Get a little taste of what I'm into
Think you're all about me
But I'm all about you yeah

But I'm all about you
Think you're all about me
But I'm all about you
