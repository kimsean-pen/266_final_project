We, we have the perfect life
Rest your head in my
We're nearly at the end of
Whoo, I let you fall apart
I watch you fall asleep
Your light is hidden everywhere

Electric paradise, why do you hurt me?

I often know to you
You took away my calling
You're not the person I once knew
You took away my powers
You took away my powers, and you know it
You took away my powers
You took away my powers

Electric paradise, why do you hurt me?
