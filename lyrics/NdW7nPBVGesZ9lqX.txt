We're alone
You're not the only one
You're like the rest of us
Oh, you will become undone

We're alone
Alone with everyone
We want to soothe the burn
We want to dull the hurt
Till we don't feel nothing

Why should we try so hard?
Let's get numb
Till we don't feel nothing
There's comfort in the dark
Let's get numb
Till we don't feel nothing

Here alone
We didn't choose to be born
Another dying sun
Just led us cool the burn
Till we don't feel nothing

Why should we try so hard
Let's get numb
Till we don't feel nothing
There's comfort in the dark
Let's get numb
Till we don't feel nothing

Till we don't feel nothing

I'd love for us to sleep at night
We try so hard
Just for us to sleep at night

Till we don't feel nothing
