I don't know whose side I'm taking
But I'm not taking things too well
I can see inside you're aching
But is it too early for me to tell?

Whoa
I try to help you out through the hardest of times
Your heart is in your throat and I'm speaking my mind
Though it looks as if it's over
I'm still not over you
If only she knew

Whoa
I try to let it go
But I don't know if I can take it (I don't know if I can take it)
'Cause the way you looked at me
Made me see that I can't really fake it

I try to help you out through the hardest of times
Your heart is in your throat and I'm speaking my mind
Though it looks as if it's over
I'm still not over you
If only she knew

I know she loves you and I can't interfere
So I'll just have to sit back and watch my world disappear
Whoa

I try to help you out through the hardest of times
Your heart is in your throat and I'm speaking my mind
Though it looks as if it's over
I'm still not over you
Oh, I'm still not over you
If only she knew
