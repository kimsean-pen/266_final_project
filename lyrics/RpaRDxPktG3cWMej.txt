You saw me crying
But you didn't want to look
You heard me hurting
But you didn't want to listen

This could have been something
This could have been really something
Tell me something more
Tell me something more worth living for

You felt me wanting
But you didn't want to give
You sensed me sinking
But you really couldn't save me

This could have been something
This could have been really something
Tell me something more
Tell me something more worth living for

People come and go
It's just the way of the world
Love just ebbs and flows
What's left for us to rely on

This could have been something
This could have been really something
Tell me something more
Tell me something more worth living for
