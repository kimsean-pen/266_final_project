Call the bells, spirits
Rise up and dance masquerade
Listen the call, spirits
Rise up and sing masquerade
Call the bells, spirits
Rise up and dance masquerade
Listen the call, spirits
Rise up and sing masquerade
Call the bells
Rise up and dance
Listen the call
Spirits masquerade
I close my eyes forever
Forever and evermore
One lonesome sigh a time between
Let the spirits in, let my spirit sing
Welcome to the lonely
Holy spirit's masquerade
The first gate of pleasure
The second door we'll lose all shame
We'll dance through the heavens
Enter spirit's masquerade
The light of day is fading
Hear the violins fill the halls
This is our way to heaven
And to spirit's masquerade
A scarlet fever shakes me
Desire burns within
Redeem me from my sins
Let my spirit sing
And when the morning falls silent
We all fall asleep
For all and forever
Forget our deeds
