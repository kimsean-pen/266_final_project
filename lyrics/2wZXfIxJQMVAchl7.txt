Testing, testing, I'm just suggesting
You and I might not be the best thing
Exit, exit, somehow I guessed it right, right
But I still want ya, want ya, don't mean to taunt ya
If you leave now, I'll come back and haunt ya
You'll remember, return to sender now, now

Well, I just wish we could go back one more time and begin it
Back before I lost myself somewhere, somewhere in it

I've been stuck now so long

We just got the start wrong
One more last try
I'mma get the ending right
You can stop this and I must insist
That you haven't had enough
You haven't had enough
Stuck now so long
We just got the start wrong
No more last place
You better get your story straight
You can't stop this and I must insist
That you haven't had enough
You haven't had enough
I still need ya, need ya, don't mean to tease ya

If you want me, I'll come back and meet ya
Whisper, whisper
You must admit you want it
You, you want it
Well I just wish we could go back one more time

And begin it
Back before I lost myself somewhere
Somewhere in it.
We've been stuck now so long

We just got the start wrong
One more last try
I'ma get the ending right
You can stop this, and I must insist
That you haven't had enough
You haven't had enough
Stuck now so long
We just got the start wrong
No more last place
You better get your story straight
You can stop this, and I must insist
That you haven't had enough
You haven't had enough
Don't you need it? Don't you want this at all?
