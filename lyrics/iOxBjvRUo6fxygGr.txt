"A few questions that I need to know"
"How you..."
"Could ever hurt me so?"

"I need to know..."
"What I've done wrong"
"And how long..."
"It's been..."
"Going on"

"Was it that..."
"I never paid enough attention?"
"Or did I not..."
"Give enough affection?"

"Not only..."
"Will your answers keep me sane"
"But I'll know..."
"Never to make..."
"The same mistake again"

"You can tell me to my face"
"Or even on the phone"
"You can write it..."
"In a letter"
"Either way..."
"I have to know"

"Did I..."
"Never treat you right?"
"Did I..."
"Always start the fight?"

"Either way..."
"I'm going out of my mind"
"All the answers to my questions"
"I have to find"

My head's spinning
Boy, I'm in a daze
I feel isolated
Don't wanna communicate

I'll take a shower
I will scour
I will rub...
To find peace of mind
The happy mind...
I once owned
Yeah!

Flexing vocabulary runs right...
Through me
The alphabet
Runs right from...
A to Z

Conversations, hesitations in...
My mind
You got my conscience asking questions that I...
Can't find

I'm not crazy!
I'm sure I ain't done...
Nothing wrong!
No! Ohhh!
I'm just waiting
'Cause I heard
That this feeling
Won't last that...
Long!

Never ever have I ever felt...
So low
When you gonna take me out of this...
Black hole?

Never ever have I ever felt...
So sad
The way I'm feeling... yeah, you got me feeling...
Really bad

Never ever have...
I had to find
I've had to dig away to find my own...
Peace of mind

I've never ever had my conscience...
To fight
The way I'm feeling... yeah, I just...
Don't feel right!

Never ever have I ever felt...

I'll keep searching
Deep within my soul
For all the answers
Don't wanna hurt
No more!

I need peace
Got to feel at ease
Need to be...
Free from pain
Going insane
My heart aches
Yeah!

Sometimes vocabulary runs...
Through my head
The alphabet
Runs right from...
A to Z

Conversations, hesitations in...
My mind
You got my conscience asking questions that I...
Can't find!

I'm not crazy!
I'm sure I ain't done...
Nothing wrong!
Now I'm just waiting
'Cause I heard
That this feeling
Won't last that...
Long!
