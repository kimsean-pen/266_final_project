She's gone away but still they stay together
People call me crazy, crazy
My thoughts progress, think about forever
My mind tells me maybe, maybe

I wish I could drive away to the sunset
Back to the day that we first met
Only believe the things I wrote
I'll put it in a note, yeah

I'll cross my T's and not my I's
Better say hello, don't you dare say goodbye
I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name
P.S. I love you forever and today

Two weeks go by so like its been the weather
The rain falls down, she's crying, crying
My thoughts progress, she thinks about forever
Their hearts are bond, lying, lying

I wish I could drive away to the sunset
Back to the day that we first met
Only believe the things I wrote
I'll put it in a note, yeah

I'll cross my T's and not my I's
Better say hello, I'm gonna wave goodbye
I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name
P.S. I love you forever and today

All the heartbreak all the pain
All the words you said in vain
And I'll never be the same

I wish I could drive away to the sunset
Back to the day that we first met
Only believe the things I wrote
I'll put it in a note, yeah

I'll cross my T's and dot my I's
Better say hello, I'm gonna wave goodbye
I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name
P.S. I love you forever and today

Forever and today, forever and today
P.S. I love you forever and today
