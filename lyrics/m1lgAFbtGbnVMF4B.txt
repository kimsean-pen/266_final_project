So you want to know just how I feel about you
I could live without you, just don't want to
I cross my heart and hope to die
But my heart says you're dying to cross my mind

Oh, the night is so young
It hurts

Pluck a heart-string, duck for cover
Hear the phone ring, start to stutter
He wants to know why I sit and sigh so
I yelled your name like a secret

Oh, the night is so young
It hurts

Grow up, grow up, my baby
Grow up, grow up, sweetheart
Grow up, grow up, my baby
Grow up, grow up, sweetheart
