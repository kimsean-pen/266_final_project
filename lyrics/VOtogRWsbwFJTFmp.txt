I love the way you look tonight
With your hair hangin' down on your shoulders
I love the way you dance your slow sweet tango
The way you wanna do everything but talk

And how you stare at me with those undress me eyes
Your breath on my body makes me warm inside
Let's make out, let's do something amazing
Let's do something that's all on the way

Cuz I've never touched somebody
Like the way I touch your body
Now I never want to let your body go

Let's make a night, to remember
From January to December
Let's make love to excite us
A memory to ignite us

Let's make honey baby soft and tender
Let's make sugar darlin' sweet surrender
Let's make a night to remember all life long

I love the way you move tonight

Beads of sweat drippin' down your skin

Me lying here and you lyin' there

Our shadows on the wall and our hands everywhere
Let's make out, let's do something amazing
Let's do something that's all on the way

Cuz I've never touched somebody
Like the way I touch your body
Now I never want to let your body go

Let's make a night to remember
From January to December
Let's make love to excite us
A memory to ignite us

Let's make honey baby soft and tender
Let's make sugar darlin' sweet surrender
Let's make a night to remember all life long

Ooh when I think about you all the time
Can't you see you drive me outta my mind
Well I'm never holdin' back again
Yeah I never want this night to end

Cuz I've never touched somebody
Like the way I touch your body
Now I never want to let your body go
Let's make a night to remember

From January to December
Let's make love to excite us
A memory to ignite us

Yeah, let's make honey baby soft and tender
Oh, Let's make sugar darlin' sweet surrender
Let's make a night to remember all, all life long

Yeah, oh
Let's make out
Let's do somethin' amazing
Let's do somethin' that's all on the way

Everyday, yeah, oh
Let's make honey, yeah
Let's make sugar
Let's make a night to remember, oh

Yeah
Let's, make love, soft and tender
Let's make a night to remember
Yeah!
