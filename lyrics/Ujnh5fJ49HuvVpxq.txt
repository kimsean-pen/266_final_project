Gotta get back
Gotta figure out a way
I'm losing my senses to you
Where did it go? The bluebird I should follow back home
But where is home?
Guess it won't amount to much
Won't be long before I crush
I'll stand in line
Don't believe a thing they say today
Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs
All alone but I'm in a crowded room
I'm sinking in the quick sand tonight
You pick me up and I shine across the sky
Till morning then you color me in
Guess it won't amount to much
Seems to me I've lost my touch
I'm back in line
Don't believe a thing they say today
Turn around and walk away
Everything will go your way
I pray
Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs

Gotta get it in time
Gotta get it last time

Don't believe a thing they say today
Turn around and walk away
Everything will go your way
I pray
Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs
Don't believe a thing they say today
Turn around and walk away
Everything will go your way
I pray
Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs
