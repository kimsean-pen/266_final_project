For so long I've tried
Could not close my eyes
when you became an outcast in this life

Again and again I try
to understand the demons inside your head
But the truth is
you love them to death

Now I know it's the last time I have tried
to lift you up, to make you fight
Nothing is ever easy in life
I can't change it if you don't
have the will deep inside

I have been blind to
how you justify
everything that you've wasted in this life

Got lost in the illusion
I'd find a solution for the demons in your head
But the truth is
you love them to death

Now I know it's the last time I have tried
to lift you up, to make you fight
Nothing is ever easy in life
I can't change it if you don't
have the will deep inside

You can blame and you can hide
behind what is wrong and what is right
Life is the choices we make
I hope you'll awake before it's too late

Now I know it's the last time I have tried
to lift you up, to make you fight
Nothing is ever easy in life
I can't change it if you don't
have the will deep inside
