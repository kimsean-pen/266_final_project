I'm a good man, food's on the table, working two jobs,
Waiting willing the neighbors check your name
I'm having fun, got no kids and I love the Lord, check your name
I'm not your MOS, never did time but maybe just once, check your name
And I puts it down, wanna see it twice, brother puts it down, check

How could you ever walk away, after all I've done for you
I feel like there's a knife in my back, babe
You might as well pull it all the way through

Good man, I'm a good man, food's on the table, working two jobs,
Waiting willing the neighbors check your name, good man
I'm having fun, got no kids and I love the Lord, check your name
I'm not your MOS, never did time but maybe just once, check your name
And I puts it down, wanna see it twice, brother puts it down, check

You watched them handcuff me lady, and walk me to my room

I never been so humiliated, I don't think that I deserve it for you
Good man, I'm a good man, food's on the table, working two jobs,
Waiting willing the neighbors check your name, good man
I'm having fun, got no kids and I love the Lord, check your name
I'm not your MOS, never did time but maybe just once, check your name
And I puts it down, wanna see it twice, brother puts it down, check
I never been, I never been so much pain, never
My life is better, my love is pretty, so much better, now
Without you I never felt so inside
Without you I never felt so inside
I'm a good man

How could you, just give up and walk away
But when things got rough you quickly ran into somebody say
I'm a good man
There's one thing I know so I'ma tell you that I'm a good man, thanks to you
Good man
Good man
Good man
