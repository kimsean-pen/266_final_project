Hey, where'd you learn to fly?
So you shoot your rocket up into the sky
Hey, I heard you set the pace
I never thought I'd see you back in this old place

Are you here to stay?
I never thought I'd see the day
Maybe in another lifetime
I'd see you walking away from me

Tell everybody you're my baby
Tell everybody we're not fading
Tell everybody no ifs or maybes
No, no, no
Tell everybody I'm your lady
Tell everybody it's not changing
Tell everybody you're still my baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey, I heard you set the tone
The day you changed the world you were alone

I'm at your command
You only have to clap your hands
Baby, I don't understand
Why you're leaving me

Hey, I only wanna make you smile
Well, maybe it'll take a while
Maybe I'll build a needing
If it pleases you

Tell everybody you're my baby
Tell everybody we're not fading
Tell everybody no ifs or maybes
No, no, no
Tell everybody I'm your lady
Tell everybody it's not changing
Tell everybody you're still my baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I almost remember your face
But it's fading, but it's fading fast
Now that I remember the taste
It's a memory with a life to last
