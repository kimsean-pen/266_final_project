In an age where stars only draw sin
Gaze is swept from the mother who birthed us here
She's stormy doubted and over relied on
Take a good long look at that horizon

We bleed it dry
We multiply
And soon we'll say it's time to fight
So scourge the host

Silenced by the solar wind
Forest ever green
Know it's a sin
It's a shameless wasteland
Shadows of towering
As far as you can set your sights on
Take a good long look at that horizon

We bleed it dry
We multiply
And soon we'll say it's time to fight
So scourge the host

She's stormy doubted and over relied on
She's stormy doubted and over relied on
She's stormy doubted and over relied on
Take a good long look at that horizon

Open your eyes
Two worlds collide
Open your eyes

We bleed it dry
We multiply
And soon we'll say it's time to fight
So scourge the host
And watch it die
