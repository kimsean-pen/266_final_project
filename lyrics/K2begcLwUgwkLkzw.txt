Patience is my ally
Design should not be rushed
Asperations long forgotten
Never left my mind

My rage must be controlled
My plans require time
My rage must be controlled until the time is right

Mastery of self control
Seething deep inside
Enemies oblivious
My ruse has made them blind

My rage must be controlled
My plans require time
My rage must be controlled until the time is right

My hate has been concealed
My time has come at last
My hate has been concealed but now the scum will die

Batter the face
Crushing the pompous fool
Retaliation
This was worth the wait

Endurance
Deception
Abhorance

Vengence
Wounds of the enemy
Oozing hypocrisy
Duplicatious slime
They are less than nothing

Twisted
Slaves to their vanity
They are beneath my feet
Only now can they learn
As my boot kicks their heads

Pitiless tormenting
Resolve never wavering
Contemptible pieces of human trash litter my life

Victory was certain
They never saw it coming
Years of planning have paid off
Voice inside silenced
