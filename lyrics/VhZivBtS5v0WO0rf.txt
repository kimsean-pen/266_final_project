A siren is circling
Around sailor boy
Her silence is rippling after before
He kissed her
To stay wide awake
Forgived her
"Please stay away"
He knows, he knows, he knows
He knows, he knows, he knows
He knows, he knows, he knows
He knows
I said Hey, hey!
Oh, what a ship we sail!
We kissed our death to will
There's no one left to take, to take
I said Hey, hey!
We're born to recreate!
Sinful creatures and then away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
I said Hey, hey!
Oh, what a ship we sail!
We kissed our death to will
There's no one left to take, to take
I said Hey, hey!
We're born to recreate!
Sinful creatures and then
away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
