Searching, Wandering
Looking for the perfect specimen
Still pure, immature
Acknowledged sickness concealed, swaggering
Unseen, stalking
Ascertain the prey
Creeping quietly

Gracious second skin
Courteous facade accepted
The cultured do not harm
Fitting in amongst the sheeple

Purpose clear
Sheltered secret
Unsoiled inceptive
Infantile delight
The itch that needs attention
Clandestine recreation
Craving obscured outside
Covering unbridled pretense

Breaks from the masquerade
Unrestrained fleeting moments reminiscence
To comprehend the need, ectasy
Schizophrenic lies, seeking explanation

No excuse,
Unchecked, no reasoning
Devoid of disease,
Disguised expertise
Living in the shroud of ordinary
Waiting to unleash the polished skill set

Plethors of just rewards
Life through the power of the conquered
Repulsed by the dormant time
Disgusted by outlook of offspring should not breed

Arrogance in no one looking
Not suspected in any wrongs
Knowing steps of specialized inquiry
Superiority on display
Flaunting prowess prodding counterparts
Provocatioin stands unanswered
Divergence of standard procedure
Bestowment of allusion granted

Come on, false rival

No excuse, unchecked, no reasoning
Devoid of disease, disguised expertise
Living in the shroud of ordinary
Waiting to unleash the polished skill set
