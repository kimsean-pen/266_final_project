Hey, little girl
You know you stole my heart back there
I had your Mississippi kisses down at New Orleans
I had your Mississippi kisses down at New Orleans
Hey, little girl
You know you stole my heart back there
I had your Mississippi kisses down at New Orleans
I had your Mississippi kisses down at New Orleans
You, oh you
Came out here to see the big easy
But you're going home tommorow
Pigtail sweet and with the southern charm yellow bow
Stole my heart
Hey, little girl
You know you stole my heart back there
I had your Mississippi kisses down at New Orleans
I had your Mississippi kisses down at New Orleans
I may never see you again
But I will remember your love forever
Pigtail sweet and with the southern charm yellow bow
Stole my heart
Hey, little girl
You know you stole my heart back there
I had your Mississippi kisses down at New Orleans
I had your Mississippi kisses down at New Orleans
I'll never forget you, my babe
Oh darlin', sweet honey
I'll never forget you, my babe
Oh darlin', my babe
Hey, little girl
You know you stole my heart back there
I had your Mississippi kisses down at New Orleans
I had your Mississippi kisses down at New Orleans
End.
