If you only were here
I could share this view with you
All the people standing here
in a very long queue
Could you read their minds for me
I' m interested in their thoughts
you think you' re free
but you wear the same socks

Everything is a circle
everything goes round
I' m still waiting for you to come
I' m still waiting for you to come

I miss my creator
he left behind the glass
maybe I' ll meet him later
thinking about lost us
wondering how long will you
be thinking about me
maybe we have to go through
it, breathing deeply into the sea

Everything is a circle
everything goes round
I' m still waiting for you to come
I' m still waiting for you to come

Everything is a circle
everything goes round
I' m still waiting for you to come
I' m still waiting for you to come
