(Prisoner of your love)

Maybe you don't think that I'll be strong enough
but I'm not gonna be the prisoner of your love
I know you're lyin', denyin'
All of your actions, so listen up
Cause here's my reaction

Here comes the night
No more living in the shadow of your love
This is my life
Always tried so hard to keep me down
But now I'll rise above
Those empty lies
Stop pretending that my accusations
Take ya by surprise
I've realized
Now I'm ending all the secrecy
I see through your disguise
All the dreams we planned
I believed so I held on
I understand... yes
So when the morning comes
You know that I'll be gone

You don't think that I'll be strong enough
Nooo baby now
I won't be a prisoner of your love
(Prisoner of your love)

No longer blind
I can focus on deception
Used to keep me by your side
I read your mind
Don't believe it's all a mystery
There's nothing you can hide
It's all defined
There's nothing you can tell me now
Could change the way I feel inside

All the dreams we planned
I believed so I held on
I understand, yeah
So when the morning comes
You know that I'll be gone

(You don't think) that I'll be strong enough
Noo baby now
