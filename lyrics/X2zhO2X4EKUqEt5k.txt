We are back in our minds, again
(x3)

We don't fight no more
We done close that door
This time for sure
We can't stand no more

Fussin' and a-cussin' each other
When we're souls to your brother
Livin' in this world we all live in

We are back in our minds, again
(x3)

We don't fight no more (we don't fight, y'all)
We don't close that door
This time for sure (we don't fight, y'all)
We can't stand no more

Fussin' and a-cussin' each other
When we're souls to your brothers
Livin' in this world we all live in

Back in our minds again
