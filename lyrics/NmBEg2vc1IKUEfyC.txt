Room on the third floor
Not what we asked for
I'm not tired enough to sleep
One bed is broken
Next room is smokin'
Air conditioning's stuck on heat

Outside it's rainin'
And the guests upstairs complainin'
'Bout the room that's got their TV too loud
I guess that times like these remind me
That I've got to keep my feet on the ground
yeaheahea

Wake up early,
Round seven thirty,
House keeper knockin' on my door
Do not disturb sign
The back of her mind
I must have left it on the floor
yeaheahea

My eyes are hurting,
Cos the cheap nylon curtains
Let the sunlight creep in through from the clouds.
I guess that times like these remind me
That I've got to keep my feet on the ground.

Na na na na
Na na na naaah
Na na na na
Na na na naaah

I guess that times like these remind me,
I guess that times like these remind me,
I guess that times like these remind me,
That I've got to keep my feet on the ground

Na na na na
Na na na naaah
Na na na na
Na na na naaah

Noo noo

I guess that times like these remind me (times like these remind me)
I guess that times like these remind me (times like these remind meheeheeh)
I guess that times like these remind me
That I got to keep my feet on the ground
