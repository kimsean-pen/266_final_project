When it feels like I'm towin' the line
And no one even cares to ask me, why I feel this way"

When you keep it all between the lines
And everything I want and I want to find one of these days" yeah

Tryin' to find out where you could belong

And I know you feel helpless now
And I know you feel alone
Well that's the same road
And the same road that I'm on, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, hey

What you thought was real in life
