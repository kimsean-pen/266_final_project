This World... need not hurt no more,
Sorry World... even though I love the song [?]
There is no one to turn to and no one to blame
For the blood of an American has scandalized our name
No World don't you sit, sit and cry
No World don't you even try
There is no one to turn to
And what will you do when the blood of American is poured out over you
When the blood of American is poured out over you
Who can I turn to?
Who can I turn to?
Who can I turn to?
What will you do?
If the doom of America is poured out over you
If the doom of America iup on you
Of the blood of America has scandalized on me
If the doom of America has scandalized on me

[ these last 4 verse were tough to
understand and I cannot attest to their validity].
