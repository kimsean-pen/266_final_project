It's going down, tonight in this town
'Cause they stare and growl, they all stare and growl
I take a scar, everytime I cry
'Cause it ain't my style, no, it ain't my style

Going down to the gravel, head to the barrel
Take this life and end this struggle
Los Angeles, come scam me, please
Emptiness never sleeps at Cliftons 6 A.M.
With your bag lady friend and your mind descending
Stripped of the right to be a human in control
It's warmer in Hell, so down we go

They say this is the city
The city of angels, all I see is dead wings
They say this is the city
The city of angels, all I see is dead wings

It's a ghost town, rabid underworld
Dionysian night, vitriolic twilight
A mirage come up, it never ends
Once you get burnt, you're never the same
Left behind, erased from time
Ain't no decency in being boxed up alive
Look around, ain't no R.I.P. signs here
We don't rest in peace, we just disappear

So here we are, Los Angeles
No angels singing in your valley of unease
I watch the sun roll down the Pacific
Over hookered Sunset Strip

They say this is the city
The city of angels, all I see is dead wings
They say this is the city
The city of angels, all I see is dead wings

There's a black moon tonight
Ain't shining down on the western neon lights
There's a black moon tonight
Ain't shining down on the western neon lights

They say this is the city
The city of angels, all I see is dead wings
They say this is the city
The city of angels, all I see is dead wings

They say this is the city
The city of angels, all I see is dead wings
They say this is the city
The city of angels, all I see is dead wings
