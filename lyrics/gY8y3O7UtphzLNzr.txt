It's a tzimmes
But you need to t'set it
Sometimes I write a little song
So you don't forget it
Sometimes I write a little song

That's the code to my heart

One six one two

Aquarion
Ford Taurus
A strike on the box

Ford Focus
Roberta flack donny hathaway
Frank sinatra

1612
That's the code to my heart
One six one two
Star

That's the code to my heart
One six one two
Star

Peace of mind
Oh, friend of mine
1612
That's the code to my heart
I go, one six, one two

That's the code to my heart
One six, one two
