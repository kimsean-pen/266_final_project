But it gets hard sometimes
I'm trying to be cool about this
But it gets hard sometimes

Ancient water trickled into your palm
I feel it on my back in the middle of the night
I know I'm alright cause you are my mother and my father and my God

The dark red in the negative space
Guide my hand across your face

I'm trying to be cool about this
But it gets hard sometimes
I'm trying to be cool about this
But it gets hard sometimes
I'm trying to be cool about this
But it gets hard sometimes
I'm trying to be cool-

In my life I try my best
In my life I try my best
In my life I try my best
