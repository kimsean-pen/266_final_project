Your footsteps on my mattress
Fill up with your absence
Your touch left me senseless
Given up on making sense
I need to see you
I need to know what's next
I need to ask you why
Wanna see through you
Wanna know what comes next
I need to know now
Cause it's been going round in my head
And I cannot forget what you said
Yeah it's been going round, it's been going round in my head
And you gon say it all in one breath
But this is more than just a mindset
You gon say it all, you gon say it all in one breath
Our words between the sheets
Only valid as long as our bodies heat
I need to pull my head out of the story line
And let it write itself from time to time
Seasons high and low
Your moving through them rather fast than slow
Let me go
You fold us close
I need to see you
I need to know what's next
I need to ask you why
Wanna see through you
Wanna know what comes next
I need to know now
Cause I want you
Always in our state of mind
Cause I want you
Always in our state of mind
Cause I want you
Always in our state of mind
Cause it's been going round in my head
And I cannot forget what you said
Yeah it's been going round, it's been going round in my head
And you gon say it all in one breath
But this is more than just a mindset
Yeah you gon say it all in one breath
