Older now and I finally know how to drive
I make my own money now love help me survive
I got the feeling that you never thought I'd be alright, yeah
Well ain't you proud that I'm sending up on my own feed
Done every single little thing I wanted to achieve
But I get the feeling that you find it hard to believe

You all that
Do it all from the start at the age of 18
The mistakes, broken hearts, always tried to fix me
But I do think it's time now to let me leave

'Cause I'm older now and you can't keep holding on (even if it hurts)
Gotta let me go, I can do this on my own
Gonna miss those days with the radio on
Gonna miss that place gonna miss the songs
But I'm older now and you can't keep holding on
No you can't keep holding

I got a key and I bought us both a place to live
Yeah I got problems and I solve 'em like I never did
I do it all but you still say I got more to give

Do you remember being my age
While it back and how you behaved
I was there when your mother said the things that you're saying to me

'Cause I'm older now and you can't keep holding on (even if it hurts)
Gotta let me go, I can do this on my own
Gonna miss those days with the radio on
Gonna miss that place gonna miss the songs
But I'm older now and you can't keep holding on

I get my heart broke
Might end up back home
But I just need you to know
That you gotta let me do it on my own
I get my heart broke
Might end up back home
But I just need you to know
That you gotta let me do it on my own

'Cause I'm older now and you can't keep holding on (You gotta let go)
Gotta let me go, I can do this on my own (I can do this on my own)
Gonna miss those days with the radio on
Gonna miss that place gonna miss the songs
But I'm older now and you can't keep holding on ('cause I'm older)
No you can't keep holding
