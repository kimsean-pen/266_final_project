Every day
In the morning paper you
Look at the news of the world economic pages
It's time to laugh all alone in your room
If only you could shine through the darkness
Yeah
Hey
And the day, and the night you dine out
So far
The reason you feel lonely
Hey
You should try
You should try
The milk and the rice
With just a bit of honey

Every day in the evening pay per view
You see the boys and the girls
They wanna be famous
They talk and laugh
You don't care for the rules
You know that nothing
Ever really changes, yeah
Hey
And the day and the night you dine out
So far
The reason you feel lonely
Hey
You should try
You should try
The milk and the rice
With just a bit of honey
