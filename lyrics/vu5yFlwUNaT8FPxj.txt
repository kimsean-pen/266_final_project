Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why
Don't matter, anyhow
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm traveling on
But don't think twice, it's all right

And it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
That light I never known
And it ain't no use in turnin' on your light
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was something you could do or say
Make me wanna change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right

And it ain't no use in callin' out my name, babe
Like you never did before
And it ain't no use in callin' out my name
I can't hear you anymore
I'm thinkin' and wonderin' all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I gave her my heart and she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

And I'm goin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
Could've done better, but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right
