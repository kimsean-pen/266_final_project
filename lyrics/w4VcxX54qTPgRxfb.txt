Hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Boy, I know you know
I said, I say I know you know
That you make me emotional
Fill my heart, body, and soul
It's the push and pull
Please explain just how you know
How to make me so vulnerable
This love is a rollercoaster

Along the coast
Come find me along the coast
Sudden raindrops condense and fall
From above me when I'm below
Let your love explode
Boy, please let it overflow
Don't release me, don't let me go
Till the sun rises in the morning

Along the coast
Come find me along the coast
Can I watch while you row your boat?
I love the way you stroke it
I know you know
Boy, I say, I know you know
I'll be missing you until the
Next time we're along the coast
Yeah

It's alright for you to touch my ooooh
Hold me tight, you know you feel so good
Spend the nights under the stars and moon
Make it last until the afternoon

Dewy dawn, a misty morning breeze
Set ablaze an entire forest of trees
That's fine by me

How low can you go?
How deep does your love go, baby?
Let me, let me know
Make love on the ocean floor
I know you know
Boy, I said, I know you know
I'll be missing you until the
Next time we're along the coast
Yeeeaaah
