I defy
I defy
Kept me in the dark, always in the dark
I was waiting
You liked me pacified, kept me undertimed
I'm waking up now
I gave my life
I made the time
I built it all
But you took what's mine for you
But it's not for you
You think that you own me
But you'll never take the best of me
'Cause I am the only
One to create my destiny
I'm not afraid to cross the line
You will break as I defy
I defy
So far beyond repair
I don't really care what it costs me
You say the truth is classified
I won't be denied
You can't stop me (not now)
You're criminal
Subliminal
Manipulating
I won't fall for it
I'll never quit
You think that you own me
But you'll never take the best of me
'Cause I am the only
One to create my destiny
I'm not afraid to cross the line
You will break as I defy
I defy
This is my world
You are just living in it
This is my world
You are just living in it
This is my world
You think that you own me
But you'll never take the best of me
'Cause I am the only
One to create my destiny
I'm not afraid to cross the line
You will break as I defy
I defy
This is my world
