No, no, no

80 dead in a foreign place
22 in the bombed foyer,
There's bloody hands, can you wash these stains?
For the times, can we stop this rage?
Watch the truth get indoctrinated
No money, no doctors for patients
Always money for bombs and not payslips
And the bullets, they keep you in slavery
Mother won't get to kiss her child
Father won't get to see her smile
Little hands, can you hold on tighter?
You saw death, now it's in her eyes
Heard they want to see you misplaced, and
What the hell are we doing to change things?
Politicians, can you see this pain?

'Cause I can hear guns in the distance
And why don't they listen
When a mother cries for her children?
Ooh hey, ooh hey, ooh, hey
I can hear guns in the distance
And why don't they listen
When a mother cries for her children?
Ooh hey, ooh hey, ooh, hey

95 in a boat found drowning
26 from a soldier's gun, there's
Too many kids, many open coffins
Tell me how all these wars been sponsored
Gettin' rich, tell me who gets paid
Little boy in the morning page
Do we mourn? Do we learn his name?
Another lost in the pouring rain
Do we try? Do we try? Do we fall back?
Little girl gettin' called by the food bank
Another mistake is sold through a new plan
Wonder awake and hope for the future
See who gets mentioned
As your minutes hand ticks by
Tell me who gets sentenced
As they commit violence at stateside
Old greedy men send boys
Time again out to the front line
Who's a tyrant here? Who's a terrorist?
I'm seeing bloodlines
If love is a kingdom
this is a prison that we're inside
And listen, child, go

'Cause I can hear guns in the distance
And why don't they listen
When a mother cries for her children?
Ooh hey, ooh hey, ooh, hey
I can hear guns in the distance
And why don't they listen
When a mother cries for her children?
Ooh hey, ooh hey, ooh, hey

Better we run, better we hide away
Forever we fall, we're burnin' the sky away
They'll never be young, they'll never be ours again
Now, look what we've done
And look what we've left for them
Now, look what we've done
Look what we've left for them
Now, look what we've done
Look what we've left for them
Now, look what we've done
Look what we've left for them

I can hear guns in the distance
And why don't they listen
When a mother cries for her children?
Ooh hey, ooh hey, ooh, hey
I can hear guns in the distance
And why don't they listen, why don't they?
When a mother cries for her children?
Ooh hey, ooh hey, ooh, hey

Ooh hey, ooh hey, ooh, hey
Ooh hey, ooh hey,
Ooh hey, ooh hey, ooh, hey
Ooh hey, ooh hey
When a mother cries for her children
