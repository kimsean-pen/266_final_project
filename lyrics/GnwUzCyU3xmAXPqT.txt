Hold you close, you feel part of my skin
In the morning, I'll map your palms again
And on your back, I'll trace this story
Here today, the lines are everything

Ohh, when you say those words
It's not with an "eh", or a trembling voice
Ohh, when you say those words to me
Ohh, when you say those words
It's not to the stars, or the wide universe
Ohh, when you say those words
It's only to me

In your backseat, before the party
The rains been on me, since the border
I never thought we'd be this harbor
Didn't think I'd be here still

Ohh, when I say these words
The space in my chest, remembers the shape of you
Ohh, when I say these words, I see
Ohh, when I say these words
I've been in covers and who would've thought
Ohh, when I say these words
I'm complete
