Is anybody there?
Does anybody care what I'm feeling?
I wanna disappear so nobody can hear me when I'm screamin'
'Cause I could use a hand sometimes

Yeah I could use a hand sometimes
They say pain is an illusion
This is just a bruise and
You are just confused but
I am only human
I could use a hand sometimes
I am only human
I am only human
I am only human

The night is bitter cold
I wonder if you know
That I'm sleepless
Waitin' like a ghost
When I need you the most
That go unnoticed
'Cause I could use a hand sometimes
Yeah I could use a hand sometimes
They say pain is an illusion
This is just a bruise and
You are just confused but
I am only human
I could use a hand sometimes
I am only human
I am only human

The weight of the world is pullin' me down
(Where are you now? Where are you now?)
Every breathe feels like I'm gonna drown
(Where are you now? Where are you now?)
I'm the only one left to hold on, oh
Singin' this song but can't find the words
'Cause I could use a hand sometimes

Yeah I could use a hand sometimes
They say pain is an illusion
This is just a bruise and
You are just confused but
I am only human

I could use a hand sometimes
I am only human
