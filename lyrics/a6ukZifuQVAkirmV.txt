Hey

You can win my love, but that's a trick though
Come give me out, I can't give you a tip though
There'll be no dreamy eyes I don't fall for hypti no
Here goes a hit I keep it simple I no sim no '
These boys been tripping chasing back to kiss her lips no
They send me texts they send me pics they think they slink no
Some send me flower acting like some sikos
Wanna win it wait a minute
If you act nice you get it
If you act right ...you can get it
If you want my love better win it

If this all lies... then forget it
If you up tight... then forget it
If you want my love better win it
If you want my love better win it

Slow down, 'aitn no zoomin' zoomin'
