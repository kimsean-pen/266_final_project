Why you so amused?
There's nothing in me
Why you always sad
When you're not with me?

I need you more than ever, girl
But forever girl I'll be
Lonely, yeah

And I, and I would shed my skin
If you would ask me
And I would die for love
It's nothing to me

But I could live forever, girl
If you never go away
Flying

She's like heroin
And she cries in her sleep
And she's nothing to me but a savior
Yeah, I cannot live in the dream

And I need her to say
That she's everything
Yeah I'm falling
Yeah I'm falling

Yeah I'm falling
Yeah I'm falling asleep
Yeah

Why you so surprised?
There's nothing to me
Dark behind the eyes
Just like I should be

And I would choose another way
If you ever fade away, oh hey
And I, and I would shed my skin
If you would ask me

And I would die for love
It's nothing to me
And I could live forever girl
If you never go away
Flying

She's like heroin
And she cries in her sleep
And she's nothing to me but a savior
Yeah, I cannot live in the dream

And I need her to say
That she's everything
Yeah I'm falling
Yeah I'm falling

Yeah I'm falling
Yeah I'm falling asleep
Yeah

And she's nothing to me
But a savior
And I try to forget
That I need her

All the times that you left
Oh I'll save her
Oh I'll save her
