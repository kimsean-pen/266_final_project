I'm going down, deeper still
I can barely breathe
Spinning 'round, losing myself
Swallowed by the reef

Hear the siren call my name
I feel so warm inside
Drifting into the light
All my life before my eyes
Salt water on your skin
I'll never taste again

No, not today, I won't leave right now
I didn't come this far just to lose you now
I won't go underground
I'm not ready, I'm not ready

I'm going down deeper still
Reaching for the sky
We were in love way back when
Bring you back tonight

Hear the siren call my name
I feel so warm inside
Drifting into the light

No, not today, I won't leave right now
I didn't come this far just to lose you now
I won't go underground
I won't go underground
Till I'm ready, I'm not ready

No, not today, I won't leave right now
I didn't come this far just to lose you now
I won't go underground
I won't go underground
I won't go underground
Till I'm ready, I'm not ready
