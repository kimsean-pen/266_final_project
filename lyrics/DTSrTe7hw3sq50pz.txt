Wind torn, naked trees
Never-ending fall
I am slowly fading away
Ashes to ashes
To dust we become
Between life and death
Loneliness and sorrow
I am gasping for air
Wondering what the voices are whispering
Ashes to ashes
A memory we become

Love and time borrowed
Time for confession
My life was a moment in time
When our loved ones are no longer here
Ashes to ashes
Nothing we become
