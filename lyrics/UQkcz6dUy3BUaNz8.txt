One Less Day
There Never Was An End To Love
Not Like That
What You Thought You Lost
It's All You Have

Keep Away
The Edge Is Gone
Feeling Lingers On
Your Sharp Blade
Like A Conquerer
You Keep Me Warm

I Tried To Run Away
I Can't Shake It
Chained To My Memory
I Can't Break Free
The End Of Love

No One Minds
How You Treat Yourself
You're Doing Fine
Can't Rewind
You've Lost Track
Of Wasting Time

Hollow Sound
Of the Morning Chimes
You've Been Up All Night
Clanging Around
The Thoughts That You
Cannot Make Right
