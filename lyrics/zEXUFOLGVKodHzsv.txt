I personify the 'adolescent on a phone'
speaking like I'm bigger than my body
I personify that lack of freedom in your life

And I'm sure she'll be gone in a second
Let me tell you about this girl
I thought she'd rearrange my world
Takes a particular type of girl
To put my heart under arrest

So why is this feeling on my chest?
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you, boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)

We can't make love when you fly around me, baby
Pipe down you're no lover
It's failing 'cos you want it to
Well I thought it was love
But I guess I must be dreaming

'Bout feeling something instead of you
What did I tell you about this girl?
The 'one to rearrange your world'
You got excited
And now you find out that your 'girl'
Won't even get you undressed

Or care about your beating chest
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you, boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)

We can't make love when you fly around me, baby
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you, boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)

We can't make love when you fly around me, baby
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you, boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me, baby
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you, boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me, baby
