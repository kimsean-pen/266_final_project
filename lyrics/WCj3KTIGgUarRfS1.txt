Hey, girl, what's up?
What's on your mind?
Heard you moved on
At least you tried
Packed up your things and drove for miles
I had to smile
I know you can't sleep
It's past three
And you're still up

Get on the group text
About your ex
'Cause I messed it up
Heard you moved on
Well that's a lie

Does he love like I do?
Touch like I do?
Babe, does it feel the same to you?
Does he hold you like me?
Make you feel free

Open your eyes and you will see
All of the awkward situations
Holding his hand you wish was mine
Does he love like I do?
Touch like I do?
Babe, does it feel the same
Feel the same to you?

Hey, girl what's up?
I'm checking in to see if you're ready to love again
Don't have to be heavy
But you can't pretend we can stay friends
Every street sign I drive by
It takes me back
Right to the bedroom
Your perfume
Little black dress
You'd say you love me while your hands wrapped 'round my neck

Do you miss me yet?

Does he love like I do?
Touch like I do?

Babe, does it feel the same to you?
Does he hold you like me?
Make you feel free
Open your eyes and you will see
All of the awkward situations
Holding his hand you wish was mine

Does he love like I do?
Touch like I do?
Babe, does it feel the same
Feel the same to you?

To you
To you
To you
To you
To you
Does it feel the same to you?
To you
To you
To you
To you
To you
Feel the same

Now I can't sleep
It's past three
And I'm still up
Get on the group text
About my ex
'Cause you messed me up
You heard I moved on
Well that's a lie
Well that's a lie
Does it feel the same to you?

Does he love like I do?
Touch like I do?
Babe, does it feel the same to you?
Does he hold you like me?
Make you feel free
Open your eyes and you will see
All of the awkward situations
Holding his hand you wish was mine
Does he love like I do?
Touch like I do?
Babe, does it feel the same
Feel the same to you?
Does it feel the same to you?
