Hold the pose, a perfect picture
Just so I remember how you're looking tonight
Let it go, now the days gone
Standing in the dark, although we've turned on the lights

Tonight we will deny, that time is passing by
It's leaving you and I to...

Freeze
A moment, its never been better
Freeze
All over, we won't last forever
You said that you're sorry for pushing me
But then smiled when I opened my eyes
I'm gonna
Freeze
A moment, while we're together

Keep the peace, by gones be gone
Coming up the rain under the life that we've made
Under here, we're not so soft
Forgiving the feeling that we put on parade

Tonight we will deny, that time is passing by
It's leaving you and I to...

Freeze
A moment, its never been better
Freeze
All over, we won't last forever
You said that you're sorry for pushing me
But then smiled when I opened my eyes
I'm gonna
Freeze
A moment, while we're together

Don't stop, gotta know what you got
There's no second chances in life
Don't break, gotta give what you take
With you

Freeze
A moment, its never been better
Freeze
All over, we won't last forever

Freeze
A moment, its never been better
I Freeze
All over, we won't last forever
You looked at me with the truth in your eyes
And you said it's ok, you can go
I'm gonna
Freeze
This moment, while we're together

Freeze
A moment
