I love it, blank stare, neutral blast off
Oh they say, bare all, lovely sacrifice
I love it, blank stare, neutral blast off
Oh they say, bare all, lovely sacrifice

Gestate remarks, cells echo saviors
Concept worship, standby admission for blame

It's coming, it drives such pretty lies

I see a sense of a brave world
While staring at a surface stain
You whistle a solemn tune
But there'll be silence soon

Fault flay
Now let the sign reign
Fault flay
Now let inside wring me dry
