The loaded guns
And poison darts
He always aims for the heart
Knows how to hurt me
Knows how to win
His love's a kick in the shins
I never thought we'd go together
But now I never say 'never'
Cos when he falls I see the boy-child
(I can't help but sympathize)
So I will rescue him
I will rescue him
Each time he knocks I'll let him in
When he wants it time and time again, time again
I'll give my forgivin'
(Seventy times seven)
So I will rescue him
I will rescue him
no matter what the cost is
When he wants it time and time again, time again
I'll give my forgivin'
(Seventy times seven)
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 I'm on your side, my patience wont tire with you
5, 6 7 Baby up to eleven, I'll never be tired of you
They see my silence
See my restraint
They think I'm crazy for waiting
For the sun to rise
Without an end
They only see his unfaithfulness
But I have golden eyes on my man
I see his soul without all the sin
They think I'm wasting my time
Making a home, in his calamity
But I can't let go
I will rescue him
I will rescue him
Each time he knocks I'll let him in
When he wants it time and time again, time again
I'll give my forgivin'
(Seventy times seven)
I will rescue him
i will rescue him
no matter what the cost is
When he wants it time and time again, time again
I'll give my forgivin'
(Seventy times seven)
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 I'm on your side, my patience wont tire with you
5, 6 7 Baby up to eleven, I'll never be tired of you
Make me long for the song you sing!
And I don't care if you're undeserving!
Cos I know that your heart is hurting
But no one can ever help the way I feel!
I will rescue him
I will rescue him
Each time he knocks I'll let him in
When he wants it time and time again, time again
I'll give my forgivin'
(Seventy times seven)
I will rescue him
i will rescue him
no matter what the cost is
When he wants it time and time again, time again
I'll give my forgivin'
(Seventy times seven)
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 I'm on your side, my patience wont tire with you...
