This won't hurt more than a pinch
So just pour a drink
Lets talk it over
I'm back after all these years
Don't be afraid my dear
Now I'm older

'Cause people change
Can't you see my eyes
Are they not the same after the lies?
I know I'm like a machine
But I still have dreams
I know one day we will...

Sleep for days
Come over, come over
I won't make the same mistakes
Come over, come over
I'm dying not to hurt you
In our dreams, we can be complete again

When you were young, you kept a list
Of the things you'd miss, as you got older
I've known you, in every life I've lived
Yeah, I'm still a kid
Even though I'm colder

When you were a child
I was lost in the wild
But you built a home for me in the road
I was born the cold
Turn up the heat
I know one day we will...

Sleep for days
Come over, come over
I won't make the same mistakes
Come over, come over
I'm dying not to hurt you

In our dreams, we can be complete
If we go to sleep, we can wake up home again

Come on over again

Sleep for days
Come over, come over
I won't make the same mistakes
Come over, come over
I'm dying not to hurt you

Sleep for days
Come over, come over
I won't make the same mistakes
Come over, come over
I'm dying not to hurt you

In our dreams we can be complete
If we go to sleep, we can wake up home again

Come over, come over
Come over, come over
