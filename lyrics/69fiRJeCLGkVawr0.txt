Oh, baby, you're making that mistake again, oh, why?
Oh, don't you understand
That every time you do, you make me cry?

I see those tears and it hurts so much
Each time you say you're sorry
'Cause no more words or regretful touch
Could change the way I'm feeling

You're doing me wrong again and again
You say that you will but you won't

Oh, baby, you're making that mistake again, oh, why?
Oh, don't you understand
That every time you do, you make me cry?

I stayed up late every lonely night
Waiting for you to call me
I used to think if I gave you time
Ooh, baby, you'd find a way to make it right

You're doing me wrong again and again
You say that you will but you won't

Oh, baby, you're making that mistake again, oh, why?
Oh, don't you understand, yeah
That every time you do, you make me cry, oh, why?

Don't explain and don't ask me why
Oh, baby, please stop crying
We've been through this one too many times
So baby, don't you put me there again

'Cause no matter how hard I try to believe
This time I know that I won't, no, I won't

Baby, oh, you're making that mistake again, oh, why?
Oh, don't you understand, babe
That every time you do, you make me cry?

Oh, baby, you're making that mistake again, oh, why?
Oh, I don't understand, yeah
Every time you do, you make me cry, oh, why?

Don't wonder why, baby, don't cry, let's say goodbye
(Oh, why?)
Don't wonder why, baby, don't cry, let's say goodbye
