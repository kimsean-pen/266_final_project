Time flows
Nobody knows
The years go by
Where we go, alone, from here

Night falls
Strange colored walls
My eyes deceive
What is wrong, with me

Deep in the night you think everything's right
Tell it to yourself
Say it's just a nightmare
Something is telling you nothing can change where you are, again

Why should it matter? Your dreams of a child
Innocence is gone
Only fear to play with
Faces are changing but nothing is changing the pain, too late

Two steps I take get closer and closer
And one more breath I take
Sends me further back

Over and over it calls to your soul
Say it is'nt so
Emptiness surrounds you
No one can help if the angels refuse to come here, who's there?

Cold faded photos they lie by your side
Something in my room
Never mind the reason
Visions are lying and reasons just live to survive, this time

The cold (the cold)
The light (the light)
The fear(the fear) returning
It's not (It's not)
the eyes(the eyes)
You feel that's chilling you.
