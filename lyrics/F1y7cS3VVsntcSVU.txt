Boy, what you crying about?
Every boy got a problem with me
Don't see things how I see
I don't know what they asking of us
Everyone got a question for us
Can they give a nigga privacy?
What is that? Where is he? Who is she?
Where is that? Who is he? What is she?
Who is that? What is he? Where is she?

Twenty bands, what it cost to start
Twenty bands, said this one is gonna flop
Twenty bands, everyone gonna see
Twenty bands, don't send for me
Twenty bands, got me up in the sky
Twenty bands, got me higher than a kite
Twenty bands, got me crying inside
Twenty bands, twenty bands, twenty bands

Twenty, I don't know what you asking of me
Caught a nigga going crazy
Get these white girls out of my home

The kush rolled in, I'm dead
Pour some liquor on my head
Easy, easy
Pour some liquor on my head
Easy, easy
