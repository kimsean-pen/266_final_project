First time you let go
You had no choice, I know
Exactly how you feel
Reaching for something more
She was out of sight
Vision blurry outlined
We have all been there
I know just where to turn

First time on your own
No one knows where you should go
It's been a hard time
Now you're gonna see it through
It won't be what you want
The light is blinding your own eyes
It's been a hard time
It's been a hard time

The way you had her there
Not knowing if she'd had a chance
The way you, the way you
The way you watched her go
Just looking for a place like home
The way you, the way you

Aren't you coming back?
Stay in hotel, room's cold
I see you looking out
Too scared to leave the shade
Close your eyes and float
I read the words you wrote
Someone show her out
Put on this song, she'll move

First time on your own
No one knows where you should go
It's been a hard time
Now you're gonna see it through
It won't be what you want
The light is blinding your own eyes
It's been a hard time
It's been a hard time
Now you're gonna see it through

The way you had her there
Not knowing if she'd had a chance
The way you, the way you
The way you watched her go
Just looking for a place like home
The way you, the way you

Let's get away, let's get away,
Let's get away, let's get away,
Let's get away, let's get away,
Let's get away, let's get away,
Let's get away, let's get away,
Let's get away, let's get away.

The way you had her there
Not knowing if she'd had a chance
The way you, the way you
The way you watched her go
Just looking for a place like home
The way you, the way you
