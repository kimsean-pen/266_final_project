saw her at GO kissing girls what a shock i said you must be an artist
she muttered her reply i was judging her friend as the dj played a dead jam
no one wants to dance they're outside smoking cigarettes
matthew was there yes he gave me the eye saying
"it doesn't kill to try" and blue lights all around

Eva, i'm sorry but you will never have me
to me your just some faggy girl and i need a lover with soul power
and you aint got no soul power

she lead me outside to the church with the swing there i was her confessor
her come on made me blush was her crush for the night till i screamed
"stop hey you must be aware i'm not alone,
i've got a tigress back at home and besides
you wouldn't know what to do with me"
and under the blue lights you see them gossiping
