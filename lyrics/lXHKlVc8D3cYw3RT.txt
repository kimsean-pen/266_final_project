This is the next century
Where the universal's free
You can find it anywhere
Yes, the future's been sold

Every night we're gone
And to karaoke songs
How we like to sing along
'Though the words are wrong

It really, really, really could happen
Yes it really, really, really could happen
When the days they seem to fall through you
Well just let them go!

No one here is alone
Satellites in every home
Yes the universal's here
Here for everyone

Every paper that you read
Says tomorrow's your lucky day
Well here's your lucky day

It really, really, really could happen
Yes it really, really, really, could happen
When the days they seem to fall through you
Well just let them go!

Well it really, really, really could happen
Yes it really, really, really could happen
When the days they seem to fall through you
Well just let them go!

(Just let them go)
