Give me your eyes that I might see
The blind man kissing my hands
The sun is humming, my head turns to dust
As he plays on his knees

And the sand and the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day

And I laugh as I drift in the wind
Blind dancing on a beach of stone
Cherish the faces as they wait for the end
A sudden hush across the water
And we're here again

The sand and the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day

My head falls back and the walls crash down
And the sky and the impossible explode
Held for one moment I remember a song
An impression of sound
And then everything is gone forever
A strange day
