When you're standing on the edge of nowhere
There's only one way up
So your heart's gotta go there
Through the darkest nights
See the lights shine bright
When heroes fall in love or war
They live forever

This is a song for the lonely
Can you hear me tonight?
For the broken hearted, battle scarred
I'll be by your side
And this is a song for the lonely
When your dreams won't come true
Can you hear this prayer
Cause someone's there for you

Well love don't need a reason
She can pick you up or leave you bleeding
I've seen a strong man cry
I know the reason why
We all forgive
We all forget
And just keep believing

This is a song for the lonely
can you hear me tonight?
For the broken hearted, battle scarred
I'll be by your side
And this is a song for the lonely
When your dreams won't come true
Can you hear this prayer
Cause someone's there for you

(Don't give up)
So let it find you
(Just hold on)
Wherever you may go
(Hear me now)
I'm right beside you
You don't have to look no more
You don't have to look no more

Oh, no

It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

(This is a song for the lonely)
Song for the lonely
(Can you hear me tonight?)
And that's not you only
(Cause this a song for the lonely)
Through the darkest nights
(Can you hear me tonight?)
You're gonna see the lights
(This is a song for the lonely)
When your dreams won't come true
Can you hear this prayer
Cause there's someone there
Can you hear this prayer
Cause someone's there
Can you hear this prayer
Cause someone's there
For you
