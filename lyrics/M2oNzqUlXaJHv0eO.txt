Baby, there's something I gotta tell you
Our love hasn't been the easiest but
I just wanted to
Say thank you for sticking me through

Love has been what I've been searching for
And you I've always counted for, oh
And never have I felt the way you made me
feel in love because I've been torn apart
And never have I had someone to make me flow and let my seeds grow

And I've been trying to move on, oh yeah I've tried
I can't help loving you
And I have tried to move on, oh yeah I've tried
I can't stop loving you
Ooh da da doo da da doo, dadadoo dadadoo dun dun na

You have found the key that unlocks my heart
I've been hoping that I'd find someone that loves me
It seems although I've found the way that love's supposed to be
We'll make the stars collide for eternity
Oh hmm hmm ah ah
(We gotta take a chance) We gotta take a chance

And I've been trying to move on, move on
I can't help loving you
And I have tried to move on, oh yeah I've tried
I can't stop loving you
So, what do you think? let's tryna make a work?
