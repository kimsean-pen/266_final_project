Can't you hear the ocean crying
Calling out to be revived
Take a step back
Realize

We all need to make a plan
Reverse effects of common man
Take a moment
Open your eyes

We're taking our time
Can't keep running, running
Take the water into your hand
I'm feeling a change that is coming, coming
The sooner that we understand

Just a drop of rain
That's all I am
And we're all the same
We have the power to make a way
If we move together as one

There's no time to waste
Actions are louder
Don't hesitate
And I see the future
It's ours to take

We are the ocean
We are the ocean
We are the ocean

When there's nowhere left to go
In a world where nothing grows
Make a choice to sink or swim
Fields of blue are turning black
How did we get so off-track
Across our seven seas?

We're taking our time
Can't keep running, running
Take the water into your hand
I'm feeling a change that is coming, coming
The sooner that we understand

Just a drop of rain
That's all I am
And we're all the same
We have the power to make a way
If we move together as one

There's no time to waste
Actions are louder
Don't hesitate
And I see the future
It's ours to take

We are the ocean
We are the ocean
We are the ocean

There's no time to waste, actions are louder
(We are the ocean)
Don't hesitate no, I see the future with pride
(We are the ocean)
We can make a change
(We are the ocean)

If we stick together as one
(We are the ocean)
Just a drop of rain
(We are the ocean)
Yes, we're all the same
(We are the ocean)
We are the power to make a change
(We are the ocean)

So come on now, make it up, make it up for me love
(We are the ocean)

Just a drop of rain
That's all I am
And we're all the same
We have the power to make a way
If we move together as one
