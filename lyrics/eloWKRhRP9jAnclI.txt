I could read her like a book
Couple minutes that it took to get her in my room
God damn she said I'm the man
Girl, I'm still a kid getting money like your dad

Aw girl

From the top
I'm not gonna worry about last night again
You just wanna see me fall again

That's alright, I know you'll be back again for the last time
You know my pain and you know my life

You are the dark and you are the light
I steal the look when you're not with me
I wrote the book on feeling empty
Why did I ever take a chance on you?
I made you feel empty like the drugs that you do
You told me that you love me that's not easy to do
But girl, don't tell me that you love me if you're just gonna leave
Don't tell me that you love me, it means nothing to me
No, no
