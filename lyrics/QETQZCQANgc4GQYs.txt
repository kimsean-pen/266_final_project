Inside a mind so deranged
How I wish you you all were dead
Annoying humanity sickens me
I contemplate your extinction
The beast I caress you never see
Every day I destroy your lives
Inside my castle walls life runs red
I have you now inside my head
I crush your feeble maggot minds
The flies collect the remnants
The locusts shatter flesh
My work almost complete
The spells are cast
Your dreams won't last
In perfect destruction
The spells are cast
Your dreams won't last
You fell for my seduction
