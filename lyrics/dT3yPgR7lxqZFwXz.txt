You disappeared all of a sudden
But where?
I've forgotten to check
To follow the hum and the rain
To follow the drummer
We lie
So in love
But this love is not for everyone
And I'm just draggin' along
Don't want it ever to stop

Daylight spring 'em up along
I did and my work began to go, oh
And if I ever did you wrong
It's rain on

Let go of everything I know
I know you're catchin' up soon
Sweet nights with you
Let go so the rain may yawn
We're spoiled and break on here, on here

Do you feel so immortal?
So real?
Pushing under the rain
Feeling thunder and pain
Oh, I've forgotten to follow the drum
I'm laying here falling in love
Draggin' along
Don't want it ever to stop

Daylight spring 'em up along
I did and my work began to go, oh
And if I ever did you wrong
It's rain on

Let go of everything I know
I know you're catchin' up soon
Sweet nights with you
Let go so the rain may yawn
We're spoiled and break on here, on here

On here, on here
On here, on here

Let go of everything I know
I know you're catchin' up soon
Sweet nights with you
Let go so the rain may yawn
We're spoiled and break on here, on here
