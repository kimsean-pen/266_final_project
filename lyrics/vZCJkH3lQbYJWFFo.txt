Honestly
You said that I think we need a miracle
Evening heat
And you were tired of a love fit for a theme park ride
Motioning
Hail a cab at for the airport
Empty street
But I was never one for short endings are cheap goodbyes

I'm a reckless lover
You already know
And the sweet, sweet, summer
I'm here on your coast
And I call your number
We meet at the ledge
Oh I, I never let it
I couldn't let it go
The night's not over
Come on, tell me its not
And I drive you home
After the city is stopped
And we both know better
Maybe we don't though
I, I never let it
I couldn't let it go (Oooh)
I couldn't let it go

Lye to me
Tell me all about the west coast
Focusing
Say it's everything we dreamed it'd be
Truthfully
I'm not doin' any better though
I try to sleep
But my mind is runnin' overtime on that endlessly

I'm a reckless lover
You already know
And the sweet, sweet, summer
I'm here on your coast
And I call your number
We meet at the ledge
Oh I, I never let it
I couldn't let it go
The night's not over
Come on, tell me its not
And I drive you home
After the city is stopped
And we both know better
Maybe we don't though
I, I never let it
I couldn't let it go
I couldn't let it go
I couldn't let it go

I'm a reckless lover
You already know
And the sweet, sweet, summer
I'm here on your coast
And I call your number
We meet at the ledge
Oh I, I never let it
I couldn't let it go
The night's not over
Come on, tell me its not
And I drive you home
After the city is stopped
And we both know better
Maybe we don't though
I, I never let it
I couldn't let it go (Ooh)
I couldn't let it go (Ooh)
