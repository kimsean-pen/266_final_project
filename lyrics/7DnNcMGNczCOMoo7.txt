Leave it up to me to fall in love just before she's moving
And leave it up to me to feel silly cause it happened so fast
Leave it up to me to wonder
Leave it up to me to laugh
Leave it up to me to feel nervous
Cause I never really know exactly
How I'll react

If your mind is the reason
If you've got a bad feeling
If your mind is the reason,
You better get your mind up and over your actions.
Leave it up to me to mess it up just when we need it
Leave it up to me to blow it all just before you go
Leave it up to me to want some love
Leave it up to me to want some change
You say, man you fall in love too quickly

Well I do and I realize that
But at the end of the day man
I think it might be
Better off that way
If your mind is the reason
If you've got a bad feeling
If your mind is the reason
You better get your mind up and over your actions
