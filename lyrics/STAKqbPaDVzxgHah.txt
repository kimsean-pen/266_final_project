You know, ma-maybe I'm drunk
Maybe I'm not
Maybe this happened, maybe it didn't
Call my doctor, call my lawyer
Call my brother, call my priest
There's paperwork to fill out
Cause a dead man walks the streets
Cause my sister has a best friend
That I've known since I was three
And now I'm gon' get strangled
Cause we tangled in the sheets
My homies like "dead man, dead man walking"
My homies like "you a dead man, dead man walking"
(dead man)
Beautiful family friend is she
Almost a decade older than me
And I've been gone for quite a while overseas, yeah...
And she's been living up in Albany
Then I had two shows I played up state
She came to show love and see my face
Then we got drinks and we chilled like "hey"
And then from there it was, y'know what I'm saying
Call my doctor, call my lawyer
Call my brother, call my priest
(call ma priest)
There's paperwork to fill out
Cause a dead man walks the streets
Cause my sister has a best friend
That I've known since I was three
And now I'm gon' get strangled
Cause we tangled in the sheets
My homies like "dead man, dead man walking"
My homies like "you a dead man, dead man walking"

My homies like "dead man, dead man walking"
My homies like "you a dead man, dead man walking"
Now she's like "Damn!
How did we let this happen, damn!
How did we end up in this bed then?"
I said "relax" and laughed like
"This would be a pretty dope song."
She's like "no, I swear to God I'll kill you
No, I really will just take your life
No, don't even think about it
But that would be a pretty dope song."
So I came home and I called my friends
Then we got smacked and I wrote this jam
I know for a fact that I'm going hehehehe
It's over, My life is dead ass over
Call my doctor, call my lawyer
Call my brother, call my priest
There's paperwork to fill out
Cause a dead man walks the streets
Cause my sister has a best friend
That I've known since I was three
And now I'm gon' get strangled
Cause we tangled in the sheets
My homies like "dead man, dead man walking"
(Y'know what I'm saying)
My homies like "you a dead man, dead man walking"
yeah, yeah
My homies like "dead man, dead man walking"
My homies like "you a dead man, dead man walking"
The funny part about this entire thing
You know like do it in one-take, write it quick, fun n jokes?
But my sister won't hear this until I release the album
She'll hear every other song except this one
So surprise
