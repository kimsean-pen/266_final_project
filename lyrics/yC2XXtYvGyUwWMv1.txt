You know he got the cure
You know he went astray
He used to stay awake
To drive the dreams he had away
He wanted to believe
In the hands of love

Hands of love
His head it felt heavy
As he cut across the land
A dog started crying
Like a broken hearted man
In the howling wing

In the howling wind
He went deeper into black
Deeper into white
He sees the stars shining
Like nails in the night
He felt the healing
Healing, healing
Healing hands of love
Like stars shining from above

His hand in his pocket
His finger on the steel
The pistol weighed heavy
His heart he could feel
Was beating, beating
Beating, beating oh my love
Oh my love, oh my love
Oh my love

Saw the hands that build
Can also pull down
Even the hands of love
Even the hands of love
