1986 Harley
Blowing smoke and sucking oil
My daddy said, 'Buy it and you're crazy boy'
You can't tell me nothin'

It took 2 months to fix it up
And one day to lay her down
I got a little hitch in my get-along now
You can't tell me nothin'

Talk is cheap and free advice
Is worth the price you pay
I had to find out for myself the hard way
You can't tell me nothin'

Hometown homecoming sweetheart
Nobody thought I had a prayer
Her mama said, 'Boy, don't you come around here'
You can't tell me nothin'

They say be careful what you wish for
I wanted to be her man
Two babies and a trailer later here I am
You can't tell me nothin'

Talk is cheap and free advice
Is worth the price you pay
I had to find out for myself the hard way
You can't tell me nothin'

They say that drinking 'll kill you
The same thing for rolling smoke
But that's two of the three things that I like most
You can't tell me nothin'

I know what the good book preaches
But I know how I am
I sure hope somebody up there understands
You can't tell me nothin'
