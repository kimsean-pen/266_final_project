When I feel like a drop in the ocean but there's no one else at sea
And my bodies bent and broken, let the Lord shine a light on me
Now the voices in the distance trying to sing my soul to sleep
But I'm drifting in the silence, let the Lord shine a light on me
Let the Lord shine a light on me

If I raise you up to the top of the mountain
Would you tell me what you see and I'm standing on this island
Did the Lord shine a light on me? Did the Lord shine a light on me?
Did the Lord shine a light on me? Did the Lord shine a light on me?
