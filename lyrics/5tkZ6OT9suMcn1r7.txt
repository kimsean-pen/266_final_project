A woman weeps
Flesh hangs in the trees
Men die for a cause
The kids and their sweets
To die on the Steppes
Carry the banner
Carry the banner high
Carry your banner
Forward to the skies
The hangman waits
A noose for you Workers, soldiers
Agitators
Marching to the incinerator
Now we pay our debts
To die on the Steppes
We paid in blood
We paid in blood
Let loose from the leash
To hunt the Bolshevik beast
We paid in blood
We paid in blood
For those who repent
We wait there too
For a free Europe
We drive East...
We drive East...
