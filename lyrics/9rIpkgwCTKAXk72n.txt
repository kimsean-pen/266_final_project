It's so hard
To get love
Jump and push and shove
To get the hand in glove
So it seems
That things are in your dreams
So it's said
Things get done in bed

It's so hard
To walk tall
To be unlike like a doll
To walk and not to crawl
So it's said
All our life is dead
So it seems
All our life is dreams

A poem in the head
Of a poet that's dead

Walk walk walk walk
Walk/up/up/walk

Oh it's god to me
Oh it's god to me
Oh it's god to me

And it's

Be in black, be in black, be in, be in black
