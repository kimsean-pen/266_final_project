As I look out my bedroom window
I see all the chaos that's calling me
So the wind blows wherever it will go
It's all too much for me

All of this emptiness I've been sharing
It never comes when I want it to
I can be anything I've forgiven
Me and you, me and you

All this time that I've spent just wanting to know
Now that I've seen it all I want is to go

As I look out of my bedroom window
Is it all real or just fantasy?
I have lost touch with what makes me human
I have lost touch with reality
It's all too much for me
All too much for me
