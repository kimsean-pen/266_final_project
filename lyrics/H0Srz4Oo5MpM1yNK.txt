Here's my hand you painted on
A circle fades inside a heart
Are you expected here
You whisper in my ear

So I wash my hands till the water burns
A circle sits outside a door
Are you expected here
I whisper in your ear

I'm whole, open
I'm starved, broken
I'm lost and found

I'm an evolutionary sleeper

If letting go means letting be
And the truth beyond the mind is what I need

If letting go means letting be
And the truth beyond the mind is what I see

I'm an evolutionary sleeper
