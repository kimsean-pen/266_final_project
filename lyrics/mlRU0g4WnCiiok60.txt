Each time on my leaving home
I run back to my mothers arms
One last hold and then its over
Watching me, you know I cry
You wave a kiss to say goodbye
Feel the sky fall down upon me!
All I am, a child with promises
All I have are miles full of promises of home
If only I could stay with you
My train moves on, you're gone from view
Now I must wait until it's over
All I am, a child with promises
All I have, are miles full of promises of hope
Days will pass, your words to me
It seems so long; eternity
But I must wait until it's over
