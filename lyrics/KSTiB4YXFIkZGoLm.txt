You look for trouble
Anywhere that you can
You're a seller and you're drawn to storm
Everybody's asking
If you're out of your mind
You're not a fool
It's just the way you were born
I try to help you
Tried as hard as I could
Held you down but you still begged for more
I tried to fight for you
But you remind me that I'm losing the war

You've got the weight of the world on your shoulders
When I'm not around
I dive through the depths of your ocean
But baby you still could have drown

'Cause I, I can't be your superman
Oh, I can't be your superman
I can't be your superman
No I can't be your superman

You look for trouble
Every chance that you get
You're elusive and you're cold to the core
Say you're getting better
It's just a matter of time
But I've heard you say it all before
You're in denial
Found a friend in the dark
Always listen but you never hear
I tried to fight for you
You've become the very thing you fear

You've got the weight of the world on your shoulders
When I'm not around
I dive through the depths of your ocean
But baby you still could have drown

'Cause I, I can't be your superman
Oh, I can't be your superman
I can't be your superman
No I can't be your superman
