I see you baby, big thighs, small waist, cute face
I wanna please you baby
Explore your private parts in a private place
Excuse me baby, but life is a deck of cars and you my ace
And when the time's right

I might call up my friends, hang out if that's how I feel
I might drop it low and pop a cartwheel
See me poppin' and poppin' and jumpin' like a Coupe de Ville
Ain't no stoppin', we rockin', we got a drink so chill
If I see a fine dude I might come here
Them chicks alright, baby I'm the real deal

You know me, when I get toasty, it's on bae
Get it, get it, get it, get it, go pop that thing
Don't care what you say, go pop that thing
Go 'head, go 'head, go drop that thing
Go 'head, go 'head, go drop that thing

Get it, get it, get it, let's get it
