Things happen but we don't really know why
If it's supposed to be like this, why do most of us ignore the chance to miss?

Wear your heart on your sleeve, make things hard to believe
I'm not feeling this situation
Run away try to find that safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like

Me! (me!)

All these things I hate revolve around me! (me!)
Yeah! (yeah!)
Just back off before I snap

And you'll see! (me)

All these things I hate revolve around me! (me!)
Yeah! (yeah!)
Just back off before I snap

Torn apart at the seams and my dreams turn to tears
I'm not feeling this situation
Run away try to find a safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like me

It's the best place to be when you're

Me! (me!)
Yeah! (yeah!)
All these things I hate revolve around me! (me!)
Yeah! (yeah!)
Just back off before I snap

And you'll see! (me)
Me! (me!)
All these things I hate revolve around me! (me!)
Yeah! (yeah!)
Just back off before I snap
