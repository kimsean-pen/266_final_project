This is something I can't hide
Can't throw it away
This is something I can't fake
They know you're away
They know how to break me
They know you're far away

If this sadness takes its place
I'll free the space it needs
I'm hiding in the place
Where we share the days
Where we share the nights
Go through dark and light

Could you believe
I'm waiting for someone?
Could you believe I'm holding
The night with my hands?
Alone in the night on my own
I feel the pain inside me
Only you can heal me

This is something I can't take
I feel so lame
There is nothing in my mind
But you all the way
You rule every moment
You're the air around me

Love's a lonely road sometimes
I keep moving on
Towards the moment you'll be mine
A long way to go
To where we belong
We'll be there before long

Could you believe
I'm waiting for someone?
Could you believe I'm holding
The night with my hands?
Alone in the night on my own
I feel the pain inside me
Only you can heal me

By sharing this moonlight
And the tears in my midnight cry
I need to hear you breathe by
Me in the night, deep in the night
