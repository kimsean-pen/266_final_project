Is Dexter ill, Is Dexter ill, Is Dexter ill
Is Dexter ill today? No Mr. Kirk, Dexter's in school
I'm afraid he's not, Miss Fishpaw
Dexter's truancy problem is way out of hand
And the Baltimore County school board have decided to expel
Dexter from the entire public school system

Oh Mr. Kirk, I'm as upset as you to learn of Dexter's truancy
But surely, expulsion is not the answer!
I'm afraid expulsion is the only answer
It's the opinion of the entire staff that Dexter is criminally insane

That boy needs therapy, psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy, purely psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy
Lie down on the couch! What does that mean?
You're a nut! You're crazy in the coconut!
What does that mean? That boy needs therapy
I'm gonna kill you, that boy needs therapy
Ranagazoo, let's have a tune
Now when I count three
That, that, that, that, that, boy, boy needs therapy
He was white as a sheet
And he also made false teeth

Avalanches is above, business continues below
Did I ever tell you the story about
Cowboys! M-m-midgets, the Indians and fron- frontier psychiatrist
I felt strangely hypnotised
I was in another world, a world of 20- 20, 000 girls
And milk! Rectangles, to an optometrist, the man with the golden eyeball
And tighten your buttocks, pour juice on your chin
I promise my girlfriend I'd, the violin...

Frontier psychiatrist
Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier psychiatrist
Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier psychiatrist
Frontier, frontier, frontier psychiatrist

Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier psychiatrist
That boy needs therapy, psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy, purely psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy
Lie down on the couch, what does that mean?
You're a nut! You're crazy in the coconut!
What does that mean? That boy needs therapy
I'm gonna kill you, that boy needs therapy
Ranagazoo, let's have a tune
Now when I count three
That, that, that, that, that, boy, boy needs therapy
He was white as a sheet

And he also made false teeth

Can you think of anything that talks, other than a person?
A-a a-a-a-a, a bird? Yeah!
Sometimes a parrot talks
Hello hello hello hello...
Yes, some birds are funny when they talk
Can you think of anything else?
Uh, a record, record, record?
