She wants nitro
When she herself's a box of TNT
Over-baptized and under-acknowledged
She lights her flame over my front door
She thinks I can make her better, better

As the percogesic was tapering off
And the fumes surrounded, I knew I bit off
More than I can chew
A load of lewisite in my lungs
I never thought I'd be so disarmed
By more than I can chew

Raised on foot binds
She stumbles through her parents' living room
As the velvet curtains were blazing
I drew my blood over my front door
And I hope she passes over, over

As the percogesic was tapering off
And the fumes surrounded, I knew I bit off
More than I can chew
A load of lewisite in my lungs
I never thought I'd be so disarmed
By more than I can chew

More than I can chew
And I hope she passes over, over

As the percogesic was tapering off
And the fumes surrounded, I knew I bit off
More than I can chew
A load of lewisite in my lungs
I never thought I'd be so disarmed
By more than I can chew
