Well I finally got my wish to work in New York city,
It isn't everything that I hoped it would be,
I while away the lonely hours, gazing at the city towers,
Wondering if there isn't someone in there just for me,

Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?
Will I ever find a home so far from Tennessee?
Theres no future in the single bars, nothing but the one night stars,
Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?

My ambition and wish?
But I'm missin' the tradition,
Everybody in a hurry,
No ones got the time and no ones got the time of day.

Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?
Will I ever find a home so far from Tennessee?
Theres no future in the single bars, nothing but the one night stars,
Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?

One city isn't pretty if you see it on your own,
It's a fabulous place?
There's no one I know to cherish, no one I can hug, and no one around? day.

Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?
Will I ever find a home so far from Tennessee?
Theres no future in the single bars, nothing but the one night stars,
Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?
