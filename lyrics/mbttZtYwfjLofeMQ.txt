We're not your sinners
Our voices are for real
We realized and won't be mourned
We gonna burn your death mask uniforms

We won't die of devotion
Understand we can never belong
Throw some acid into your face
Pollute your mineral water with a strychnine taste

You love us
You love us
You love us
You love

You love us
Oh, you love us
You love
You love us

You love us
You love

'Til I see love in statues
Your lessons drill inherited sin
Parliament's a fake life saver
You better wake up and smell the real flavor

You love us like a holocaust
Same PR problem as E.S.T.
You love us like a holocaust
Same PR problem as E.S.T.

You love us
You love us
You love us
You love

You love us
Oh you love us
You love
You love us

You love us
You love

You love us
You love us
You love us
You love
You love us
Oh, you love us
You love
You love us
You love us
You love
