you are pretty because your shotgun fills me up
you are pretty because your knife twist lets my blood
you, the one that I love
you always were because

if I send you my army only you can disarm me
if you won't have me or bring me your love,
furious angels reign death from above onto me

you're the one that I love, you always were because
I was made of a storm, only you could bring me home
hold out for what?
I know I'm dreaming on and on
hold out for why?

we've said our last goodbye
if you won't have me or carry in rings
everything broken is fixed when you sing to me
oh love, in love
