We used to think our words were gold
That our binded hearts could
Withstand cold
We were catching diamonds in the rain
Letting precious water through the drain
Stars were dancing in their light
A past that we could never right
Oh, they were dancing
Way up high
We built these walls so we could find
Who could prove themselves
through the waves of time
Trying to repent before you sin
Is like giving up before you begin
Stars were dancing in their light
A past that we could never right
Oh, they were dancing
Way up high
Stars were dancing in their light
A future we will never write
Dirt on our feet was bone dry
it was bone dry
Thought another goal is all we needed
Taking second chances till we bleed
And when all the love had been depleted
We had but no choice to concede
As the stars were dancing in their light
A past that we could never right
Oh, they were dancing
Way up high
Stars were dancing in their light
A future we will never write
Dirt on our feet was bone dry
it was bone dry
