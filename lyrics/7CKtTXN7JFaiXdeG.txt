When days fall dark, everything will fall apart
No path to guide, solace for a shattered heart
Inside
Something in your soul will beg you why
What gain it is to live and die

Here we stand
To turn and face the odds
Sacrifice yourself
Or bow to lesser gods

If this is all, where though will we meet again?
I won't relent, suffer to a bitter end
Inside
Something in your soul will beg you why
What gain it is to live and die

Here we stand
To turn and face the odds
Sacrifice yourself
Or bow to lesser gods
Sacrifice yourself
Or bow to lesser gods

There is no time for hesitation
To vow unto a caving world
Throw yourself upon the fire
Hear the call ascending from inside
Something in your soul will beg you why
What gain it is to live and die

Here we stand
To turn and face the odds
Sacrifice yourself
Or bow to lesser gods
Here we stand
To turn and face the odds
Sacrifice yourself
Or bow to lesser gods
