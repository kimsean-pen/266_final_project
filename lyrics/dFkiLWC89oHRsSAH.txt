No one dared to shoulder that shower
When no body seemed to be pleased
The world's not even touched by the washer
Just another Nazi scheme, yeah

The big takeover, yeah
Mile high, the big takeover, yeah

All throughout this sole condition
Beg yourself for the final quest
The world is through with this tone integration
Just another Nazi test, yeah

The Big Takeover, yeah
Mile high, the big takeover, yeah

So believe me when I say
There's no hope for the USA
The world is through with this tone integration
Just another Nazi test, yeah

The Big Takeover, yeah
Mile high, the big takeover, yeah
