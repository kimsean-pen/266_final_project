Lonely moonlight guides my eyes right to the door
So many nights I'd lay here wondering will I ever cross the floor
Slipping from my grip no matter what I'd do
All the dreams I held so tightly I could not stop from falling through
But right here with you everything's changing
You change me
You change things

Here and now
Never felt like this before
And it's the moment I've been waiting for
Been waiting to step into the future
Step into the future
Here and now
Feels like flying realizing that there's more

To this life than just surviving there is love worth dying for
But right here with you everything's changing
You change me
You change things

It's more than how you've changed things
It's how you're changing me
All I really needed was something to believe
Here and now
I'm standing at the open door
And it's the moment I've been waiting for
Been waiting to step into the future. Step into the future
Here and now
