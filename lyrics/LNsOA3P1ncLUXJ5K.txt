Stranger's arms reach out to me cause they know I'm so lonely
Then my mind goes back to you your sweet love sees me through
Your sweet love sees me through
[ strings ]
Stranger's eyes see through me they know I need company
Then I stop and think of you your sweet love sees me through
Your sweet love sees me through
[ strings ]
Strangers take my loneliness tell me that they understand
Until the death I'll think of you and your sweet love sees me through
Your sweet love sees me through
