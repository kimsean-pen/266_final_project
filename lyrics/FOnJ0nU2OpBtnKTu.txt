something's in the air tonight
the sky's alive with a burning light
you can mark my words something's about to break

and I found myself in a bitter fight
while I've held your hand through the darkest night
don't know where you're coming from but you're coming soon

to a kid from Oregon by way of California
all of this is more than I've ever known or seen

come on and we'll sing, like we were free
push the pedal down watch the world around fly by us
come on and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you

and here we go there's nothing left to choose
and here we go there's nothing left to lose

so I packed my car and I headed east
where I felt your fire and a sweet release
there's a fire in these hills that's coming down

and I don't know much but I found you here
and I cannot wait another year
don't know where you're coming from but you're coming soon

to a kid from Oregon by way of California
all of this is more than I've ever known or seen

come on and we'll sing, like we were free
push the pedal down watch the world around fly by us
come on and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you

and here we go there's nothing left to choose
and here we go there's nothing left to lose

I can still hear the trains out my window
from Hobart street to here in Nashville
I can still smell the pomegranates grow
and I don't know how hard this wind will blow
or where we'll go

come on and we'll sing, like we were free
push the pedal down watch the world around fly by us
come on and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you

and here we go there's nothing left to choose
and here we go there's nothing left to lose
