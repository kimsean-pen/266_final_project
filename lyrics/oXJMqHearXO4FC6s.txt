She's caught beneath the ice
He reaches from the shore
Trapped on the other side
Can he get to her before
The bitter cold takes hold
And doubt drives out their hope?
An evergreen
The winter's token
A promise of the spring
Though all is bleak
And the world is broken
We know that we are evergreen
Our love remains unfrozen
Who could believe the lie
When truth is all you know?
Now that I've heard your voice
I can't settle for an echo
I saw all love untrue
'Til you came into view
An evergreen
The winter's token
A promise of the spring
Though all is bleak
And the world is broken
We know that we are evergreen
Our love remains unfrozen
Remember when I met you
Somehow I would forget to
Keep up my guard
You stole my heart
But I don't want it back again
It grows stronger in your hands
We are evergreen
We are evergreen
We are evergreen
We are evergreen
