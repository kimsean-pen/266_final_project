Well, you can run like a rabbit, fly like a bee
No matter what you do, you'll never get away from me
Because I'm right behind you baby
Right behind you baby
Oh yes, I'm right behind you baby
You'll never get away from me

Well, you can fly through the air or sail on the sea
No matter what you do, you'll never get away from me
Because I'm right behind you baby
Right behind you baby
Oh yes, I'm right behind you baby
You'll never get away from me

Well, you can go to the east or go to the west
The north and the south, all the rest
You can bop at the hop, stroll across the floor
Don't think you never gonna see me anymore

Well, you can mask your face and dye your hair
No matter where you go, just turn around and I'll be there
Because I'm right behind you baby
Right behind you baby
Oh yes, I'm right behind you baby
You'll never get away from me

Well, you can go to the east or go to the west
The north and the south, all the rest
You can bop at the hop, stroll across the floor
Don't think you never gonna see me anymore

Well, you can mask your face or dye your hair
No matter what you do, just turn around and I'll be there
Because I'm right behind you baby
Right behind you baby
Oh yes, I'm right behind you baby
You'll never get away from me

Yeah, I'm right behind you baby
You'll never gonna get away from me
I'm right behind you baby
You'll never gonna get away from me
