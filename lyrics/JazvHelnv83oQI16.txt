You won't give me no more
You won't give me no more
You won't give me no more
You won't give me no more
You won't

Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same

Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same

I been coming up for a while on your radar
I know I made it just by counting up my hater
I got a speedboat, get away like later
You better have a load of cheddar if you ain't got data

'Cause you can live it up, pull it up, start reeling
Start throwing hands up like you're mad at the ceiling
You can make a killing but don't forget the feeling
People stealing money and down with double dealing

You won't give me no more
You won't give me no more

Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same

Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same

You can take me courthouse
You can take me jail
You can take me anywhere
But you can't get me there

You can ask me where I'm going
And I'll tell you crazy
But when I get to where I'm going
You should come with me

You been staying up, pull me up, start reeling
I'm throwing up my hands like I'm mad at the ceiling

Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same

Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same

I got roof on my head, I got food in my pot
And the old ways are dead with the new ones we got
There is water in my pot and I'm half and half not
And the old kind is broke with the new kind we bought

I drink alcohol, know the words to 'Wonderwall'
I rewrite the code while I do my time on road

Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same

Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same

Tell me why
Things change but it feels the same
If life is such a game
How come people all act the same
