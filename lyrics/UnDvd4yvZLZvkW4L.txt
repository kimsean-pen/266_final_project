Compare our dependence to predator and prey
A parallel engraved into our souls by the work of broken hands
(Contradiction carved in canvas)
(And our nail-beds ache from scratching at the surface)

Coerced by your creation
Finding foundation in decay
With the culmination of our failure on display
Convince yourself I am your greatest masterpiece

Disassemble me however you see fit
And put me back together absolving me of my impurities
And you know I'd welcome your embrace
Even if your arms resembled teeth

Cover me in scars
Close your eyes in case I bleed
I welcome you and your embrace
Even if your arms resembled teeth
Close your eyes in case I bleed
I'd let you cover me in scars if you could carry me forever

Carry me forever in your heart
Carry me forever in your heart
Carry me forever in your heart

A predator, I pray;
Release me from the mouth of dependency
Forgive me for my absence
Our love will know not wasted time
