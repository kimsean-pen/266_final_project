Am I lonely?
Oh it feels like when the day breaks
Am I wanted inside?
Say goodbye, do you feel liked?
Wave goodbye, and the heart's not in love

We'll be taught
We'll be tall

Am I lonely?
Cause it feels right
If I look up, can you keep me alive?
Wave goodbye to your family and friends
Those lost ants
And your eyes bleed when you see
Cause nothing works inside

We'll be taught
We'll be tall
