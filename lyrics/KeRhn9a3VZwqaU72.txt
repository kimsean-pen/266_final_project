Prez gorite, prez poliata
Pod zvezdite, nad zhitata

I know her, used to follow everywhere we'd go
And it's so sweet, now she's sleeping with a boy I know
The boy I know, knows a pretty girl in every town
And the way they look, they were made to let each other down

She got her face from the same house where she stole her clothes
On the same street there's a dance hall where nobody goes
Four to the floor, stealing cigarettes of '90s ghosts
And then at Christmas time, 'till we exceed the recommended dose

Prez gorite, prez poliata
Pod zvezdite, nad zhitata
Shte patuvat prez noshta
Risuvat prez denia I shte spiat do obed
Viatarat gi bruli na srebaren mz
I shte piat gorski chai ot zlaten samovar
Litsata im greiat s ognenen zagar

I know her, used to follow everywhere we'd go
And it's so sweet, now she's sleeping with a boy I know
The boy I know, knows a pretty girl in every town
