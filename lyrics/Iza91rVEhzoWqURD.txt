I'm at war with nothing in a place that's not around
I will sneak my way in, pass the beeps not make a sound
They will search my bag, find the bullets not the gun
What if they knew that my AK's made of glue and good wishes from my mom

Babe i'll take the fast train
They'll be waiting in the black rain
Only thing to kill for is me and you
This city claims the crazy
And there's no one here to save me
Everything decays unless it's true

There's a big bang bombing at a place no one can find
Now I'm on my way to a war I should have left behind
Like the ouches and the aches and mistakes that can't be undone
I'll be there they'll wait for me, my bullets and my gun

Babe i'll take the fast train
They'll be waiting in the black rain
Only thing to kill for is me and you
This city claims the crazy
And there's no one here to save me
Everything decays unless it's true

And i heard them say eoh

Babe i'll take the fast train
They'll be waiting in the black rain
Only thing to kill for is me and you
This city claims the crazy
And there's no one here to save me
Everything decays unless it's true

And i heard them say...
And i heard them say...
And i heard them say eoh
