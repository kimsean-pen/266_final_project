i've got a block of ice in my hand
it starts to melt like anything can

there's no more time
to waste
there's no more time
to waste

i put my quarters in a plastic cup
after we're gone maybe it fills up
wait until the front yard looks like key lime
just watch it happen in the meantime

there's nothing left
to say
