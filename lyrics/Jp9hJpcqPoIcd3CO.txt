Wake up; all the past stops are up now
I see light, must be you
Warm shared light
But it is blue
Light by life
in slow motion
Only shines
Until stars shine
Don't be afraid

What? Are you surprised?
I'm staying alive
I'll spit in your eye; drive a stake in you
Take me away, Take me away
I gave you the world, was all for you
But I'm sick and tired of wasting time
I want mine
Take me away, take me away
I gave you the world, was all for you
Stinking lies, stinking lies, stinking lies

We'll die trying to live so alone
I can wait, and i should
Leave the phone off the hook
Don't be afraid
