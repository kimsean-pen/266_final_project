I close the door
Like so many times, so many times before
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
I wanna let you walk away tonight without a word

I try to sleep, yeah
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
A thousand more regrets unraveling, ooh
If you were here right now
I swear I'd tell you this

Baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin' it inside, it's killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you (to you)
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

I climb the walls, yeah
I can see the edge
But I can't take the fall, no
I've memorized the number
So why can't I make the call
Maybe 'cause I know you'll always be with me
In the possibility, oh whoa

Baby I don't wanna waste another day (another day)
Keepin' it inside, it's killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you (uh, to you)
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

Oh oh no, no, no

I don't wanna be like this
I just wanna let you know
That everything I hold in
Is everything I can't let go (Oh oh oh oh, can't let go)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Cause baby

Baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin' it inside, it's killing me (killing me 'cause)
'Cause all I ever wanted (all I ever wanted)
comes right down to you (to you), to you (to you)
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable
Oh oh oh oh

Don't you know it baby, I don't want to waste another day
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah oh oh
I'm inconsolable
Whoa oh oh oh yeah yeah oh oh
I'm inconsolable
Oh oh yeah yeah
