Well you want
to be in the gang
and you've got
got to join the team
to be on the team
you must play to win
you play to win
you may not make it home
up the hill, down again
you're the one
every body wears a badge
uniform
soldier boys!
we've got plans for you
a brand new game
we call it "mass control"
when you grow up
it's not so obvious
dirt on your face
holding your broken toys
up the hill, down again
you're the one
everybody wears a badge
uniform
