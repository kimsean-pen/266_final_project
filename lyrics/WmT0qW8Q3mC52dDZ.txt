Everybody can try to talk with my head
In these years I learned that I don't need anybody
Everybody can speak ill
Everybody can start again
Everybody can live with himself and now
Believe me and, if you're in love, find me alone

When I met you in the 1990, I said oh oh oh ooh
She was brilliant and waiting for a brand new sin
I'm just looking for peace
Everybody can start again
Everybody can live with himself and now
Believe me and

With your footprints, you can't learn to forget
Anything you can see, we conquered
We conquered in the sun
Don't be afraid for me
The enemies will leave the ground
The sand I left on the desk
Will be the sun you never saw
