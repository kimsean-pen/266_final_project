Stayed up late
Tried to dream ourselves awake
We've been growing up with grace
Been wondering if I should stay
Well, if you say so

Heaven knows
She's not quite who she hoped she'd be
And heaven knows I disagree
Just nod in time and don't misspeak
And all the while be wildly bored

So keep the front door closed
Keep your ears to the ground
Keep your eyes on the open road
But don't go

And since I can't forget
I want to breathe out new lungs
And cast a whole new silhouette
I want to

The sky could fall tonight for all I care
On South Street
I won't be there

After 9, met you at the station sign
Slightly drunk but quite contrite
I'm wired to the moon tonight
I'm going nowhere

Faster now
Headlong through the city streets
May Christmas lights come on for me
Make me believe in make believe

So keep the front door closed
Keep your ears to the ground
Keep your eyes on the open road
But don't go

And since I can't forget
I want to breathe out new lungs
And cast a whole new silhouette
I want to

The sky could fall tonight for all I care
On South Street
I won't be there
