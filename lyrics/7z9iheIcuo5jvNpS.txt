There's no time to keep it low
I've been deaf, now I want noise
You stay down
But I won't be quiet
I'll hammer on until you fight

Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Hammer on, 'till you fight

If you've got some time to kill
Slow resistance wins the war
Well I know
Yeah, but that's no way to go
You can't resist the louder pulse

Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Cant resist, Loud love yeah

All right

Well that's right
I want something to explode
I've been deaf
Now I want noise

Loud love yeah
Loud love yeah
Love
Loud love
Love
Yeah
