Road is wide, sky is black

Rattle snake running down your back
Desert howls, liar's moon
Bang bang bang boom boom boom boom

I want your love, I want your love
I want your poison in my cup
Morning sun rises soon
Bang bang bang boom boom boom boom
Bang bang, in ring of fire
Bang bang, my sweet desire
Bang bang, my love is true
Bang bang, I die for you
Bang bang bang boom boom boom boom

Count it down from ten to one
Crazy heart, lucky gun
We were born, bad blood and bone
You're the sticks, I am the stones
Bang bang, in ring of fire
Bang bang, my sweet desire
Bang bang, my love is true
Bang bang, I'd die for you
Bang bang bang boom boom boom boom

I'll be Bonnie, you'll be Clyde
Rock and roll suicide
Meet you on the other side
Bullets made from silver spoons
I got em' baby just for you
Go ahead and make your move
And do it soon

Bang bang, in ring of fire
Bang bang, my sweet desire
Bang bang, my love is true
Bang bang, I'd die for you
Bang bang bang boom boom boom boom
And the last bang bang may be for you
