When the prophet speaks, mostly no one listens
When the prophet speaks and no one hears
Only those who have ears to listen
Only those that are trained to hear

Come closer now, I'll tell you what they whisper
Closer now, we'll whisper it in your ear
What big ears you've got when you get the details
Do you understand, do I make it clear?

When the prophet speaks, yeah, no one listens
When the prophet speaks, mostly no one hears
Only those that are trained to listen
Only those who have ears to hear

When the prophet speaks, yeah, no one listens
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't you have no fear
You gotta get the truth on what is happening
When the prophet speaks, have to make it clear

Come closer now and I will whisper
Whisper the secret in your ear
What thick ears you've got when you get all the details
Do you understand, do I make myself clear?

When the prophet speaks, you've got to listen
When the prophet speaks, you've got to get the truth
When the prophet speaks, don't need no explanation
When the prophet speaks, have to make it move

Prophet speaks, no one listens
When the prophet speaks, mainly nobody hears
Only those that are trained to listen
Only those who have ears to hear
