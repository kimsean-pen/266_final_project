I will swallow
If it will help my sea level go down
But I'll come back to haunt you if I drown
I will swallow
If it will help my sea level go down
But I'll come back to haunt you if I drown

I will swallow

I will, I will swallow

I'll tell the truth
All of my songs
Are pretty much the fucking same
I'm not a faerie but I need
More than this life so I became
This creature representing more to you than just another girl
And if I had a chance to change my mind
I wouldn't for the world
Twenty years
Sinking slowly
Can I trust you
But I don't want to

I will swallow
If it will help my sea level go down
But I'll come back to haunt you if I drown
I will swallow
If it will help my sea level go down
I'll take a deep, deep breath
But I'll come back to haunt you if I drown

I will swallow

I will, I will swallow

I don't want to be a legend
Oh well that's a god-damned lie, I do
To say I do this for the people
I admit is hardly true
You tell me everything's all right
As though it's something you've been through
You think this torment is romantic
Well it's not, except to you
Twenty years
Sinking slowly
Can I trust you
But I don't want to

I will swallow
If it will help my sea level go down
But I'll come back to haunt you if I drown
I will swallow
If it will help my sea level go down
I'll take a deep, deep breath
But I'll come back to haunt you if I drown

I will swallow

I will, I will swallow

Low tide and high tea
The oysters are waiting for me
If I'm not there on time
I'll send my emissary
If I photoshop you
Out of every picture I could
Go quietly, quiet
But would that do any good
Will it hurt? No it won't
Then what am I so afraid of
Filthy Victorians
They made me what I'm made of
The brighter the light
The darker the shadow
I don't need a minder
I've made up my mind Go away
Twenty years
Sinking slowly
Can I trust you
But I don't want to

I will swallow
If it will help my sea level go down
But I'll come back to haunt you if I drown
I will swallow
If it will help my sea level go down
I'll take a deep, deep breath
But I'll come back to haunt you if I drown
I will swallow
If it will help my sea level go down
But I'll come back to haunt you if I drown
I will swallow
If it will help my sea level go down
I'll take a deep, deep breath
But I'll come back to haunt you if I drown
I will swallow
If it will help my sea level go down
But I'll come back to haunt you if I drown
I will swallow
If it will help my sea level go down
I'll take a deep, deep breath
But I'll come back to haunt you if I drown

I'll take a deep, deep breath
I'll take a deep...
I'll take a deep...
