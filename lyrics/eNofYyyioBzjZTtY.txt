Into the killing zone
Prepared to die
Fearful technology
Faceless mercenary
Merchant of war
With no conscience
Darkness all you see
Dying hard your believe

Mercenary
Mercenary

Purchased soul
To the highest price
No thoughts of anguish
Cheapness of life
Freelance veteran
Ask no forgiveness
No tears, no regrets
Mission completed

Mercenary
Mercenary

Forget the past - For all you see
Self-created destiny

No innocence - The world bleeds
Now march onward - Mercenary
