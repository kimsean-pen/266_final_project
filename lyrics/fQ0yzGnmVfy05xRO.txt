I keep you under my suspicion
Until you learn to ask the questions why
If you keep me rocking on this intermission
There'll be no answers see, there'll be no party time
And we love ourselves, but we lost our way in the jungle
Girl you own my world, cuz there's nowhere left to hide
Wild life
Nothing to lose when we're falling into paradise
Wild life
The crazy things we do, but I could never live without you
(I could never live without you in paradise x2)

(2nd verse missing sorry, just own it & freestyle this verse) New song & there's mistakes throughout ^^

And we love ourselves, but we lost our way in the jungle
Girl you own my world, cuz there's nowhere left to hide
Wildlife
Nothing to lose when we're falling in paradise
Wildlife
The crazy things we do, but I could never live without you
I could never live, without you in paradise
I could never live, without you in paradise,

(I could never,
I could never,
I could never
I could never live without you)

The crazy things we do but I could never live without you,

Wildlife
Nothing to lose when we're falling into paradise
Wildlife
The crazy things we do but I could never live without you
I could never live without you in paradise
I could never live without you in paradise
