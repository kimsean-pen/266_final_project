Dad dad why did you let that man
Push you around like that
You should have beat him down
Down to the ground
Down to the ground for that

He said, "Son, you're still young
And you always jump the gun"

There's real people in the big big trucks
That you flip off when they get in your road
You get so hacked but you pay no mind
To the great big sign that says oversize load

You really think they can go as fast
As you in your 87 trans am
They know you're in a terrible rush
They're going just as fast, as fast as they can

Dad dad I really don't understand
What driving big trucks has to do with that man
You should have taught him a lesson about being rude
About talking to you with such an attitude

He said, "Son, you're still young
And you always jump the gun"

There's real people in the big big trucks
That you flip off when they get in your road
You get so hacked but you pay no mind
To the great big sign that says oversize load

You really think they can go as fast
As you in your 87 trans am
They know you're in a terrible rush
They're going just as fast, as fast as they can
