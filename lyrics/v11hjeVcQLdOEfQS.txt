Then I painted your face
On a twenty dollar bill
But it isn't legal tender
And I think about you still
And all the comfort in words
Provide no comfort
We can all go mad together
That's what friends are for

And at the sideshow by the seashore
The girls are dressed as mermaids
An electrical storm
Has caught us in a trap
Maybe if I yell at you
You'll trust in what I'm sayin'
But I'm keepin' all the secrets
And I have nothin' else to say
