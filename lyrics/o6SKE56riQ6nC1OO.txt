Lying within a wooden chamber,
Suspended within stale air...
No pulse, no light...
No hope...
Decaying remains left to rest,
Only to be tortured by its own face...
This face is my own...
A pale reminder, staring back at me...
No escape, no control...
Eternity shall be spent like this.
Beneath Silent Faces
My corpse weeps quietly.
