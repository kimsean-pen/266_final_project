They say that everyday is a new beginning
But I know I'm not alone when the darkness hits me
We dream all day in black and white
And when the sun comes down and we learn to live again
We waste away the darkest light
And when the sun comes down and we learn to love again

It feels better in the dark, it feels better in the dark
I feel closer to your heart and nothing can come between us
It feels better, it feels better in the dark
I feel closer to your heart and nothing can come between us

Lights flash before my eyes and the curtain's open
I knew the sound
A familiar line
When the spell is broken

We dream all day in black and white
And when the sun comes down and we learn to live again
We waste away the darkest light
And When the sun comes down and we learn to love again

It feels better in the dark, it feels better in the dark
I feel closer to your heart and nothing can come between us
It feels better in the dark, it feels better in the dark
I feel closer to your heart and nothing can come between us

We will take what we're given
And we will bury our love in the night
Sunlight comes and forgiven
So while I'll leave you maybe I'll dream of you once in a while

It feels better in the dark
It feels better in the dark

It feels better, it feels better in the dark
I feel closer to your heart and nothing can come between us
It feels better in the dark, it feels better in the dark
I feel closer to your heart, nothing can come between us
