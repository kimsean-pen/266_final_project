Finally, I've met you
The day has come
You're more than beautiful
And you're my son

I don't deserve this
I never thought it could be
Quite like the moment
When you first smiled at me

A toothless, wonderful feelin', like I'd never seen
It's you, Noah, it's you

And when you lie down to sleep
I'll protect you from demons of the night
While I'm watchin' you grow

I'll pray, there's so much I could teach you
If you only have the time
Pray, there's so much God can teach you
If you only have the time

So, will you tell me
The little things?
What does God look like?
And Angels' wings?

I don't remember these things
So, would you teach them to me?
So, for the moment
I'll watch you breathe

And when you wake up in the mornin'
And I pour the coffee, you're always smilin' sweetly

And when you lie down to sleep
I'll protect you from demons of the night
While I'm watchin' you grow

I'll pray, there's so much I could teach you
If you only have the time
Pray, there's so much God can teach you
If you only have the time

I'll pray, there's so much I could teach you
If you only have the time
Pray, there's so much God can teach you
If you only have the time

I'll pray, there's so much I could teach you
If you only have the time
