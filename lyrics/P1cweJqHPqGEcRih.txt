You're the dark to light
You're never satisfied
You only know the things
that will fail to be
A pessimistic one
Who sees the end to come
Where every joy is lost to a tragedy

And still you wonder why you cannot find your peace today
'Cause you were meant to live
So much more than this
Now if only you could see

You could be standing out in the sun
Still the rain's coming down
Rain's coming down
There ain't a cloud in sight
Still your heart beats cold and gray
Every day

You know, it brings me down
The way you drag around
Your heavy heart just like a stone
Well, keep your misery
Don't put it all on me
'Cause I've got problems of my own

You could be standing out in the sun
Still the rain's coming down
Rain's coming down
So keep your cloud of darkness and doom off my parade
Yeah, today

And if I go, you know I set off a spark
I would burn it out, I would burn it all away
If you're a fire jaded, cold, calloused heart
Some day, I'll find a way

You could be standing out in the sun
Still the rain's coming down
Rain's coming down
There ain't a cloud in sight
Still your heart beats cold and gray
Every day

You could be standing out in the sun
Still the rain's coming down
Rain's coming down
Someday I'll steal the spark, I will burn your cloud away
I'll find a way
