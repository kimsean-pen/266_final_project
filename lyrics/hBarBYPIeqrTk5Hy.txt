My corner
You'll find me every day
The boys come out
That's where we like to play
Gonna tag along
I'll set the way
And tried to get high
What price you gonna pay

Been around the world
Been around the world
The stormy gates and the maiden Pearl
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
All around the world
All around the world

Keep dancing,
Like its ya last time
We're so thin ice
Swimming in the light
When the curtain falls,
I'm on your scene
What sweet surprise
She said to me

Been around the world
Been around the world
The stormy gates and the maiden Pearl
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
Take it all the way
Take it all the way
All the way
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
All around the world
All around the world
