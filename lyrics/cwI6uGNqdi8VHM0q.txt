Sit down with emotion
take the time to feel it
like a cloud cross the mind
never holding onto
let it all just billow by
spun around till I fell down
I'm not looking for a pick up
I spun around till I fell down
I'm not looking for a pick up
mess up
mess up
mess up
mess up
mess up
mess up
mess up
mess up
I want to love myself
out in the field I'm kissed by the sun
away from everyone
I want to catch my breath
I've been throwing it out all in bouts
speaking of empty things just to fill the air
to not hear my ears ring
I want to find myself
down the road I go for a walk
say hi to passers by they wave back at me
I feel like somebody
I want to make a nest
I've been on the road without house
on my phone too much to try and feel in touch
with those I don't see enough
And that I'll be happy when
this happens or that becomes
or it is finished and I am done
oh what an idea
And that I'll be happy when
this happens or that becomes
or it is finished and I am done
Spun around till I fell down
blood upon my knees as I kneel now
Spun around till I fell down
blood upon my knees as I kneel now
Spun around till I fell down
blood upon my knees as I kneel now
Spun around till I fell down
blood upon my knees as I kneel now
And I'll be happy when
