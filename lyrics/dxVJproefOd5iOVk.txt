I use my outside voice because I have no choice
The barn that I was raised in was constructed out of noise
And now I'm all torn up because my buttercup
Up and gone and left me
Said she finally had enough
Left me here to ruminate on all she can't admit
And all she can't explain

All time what
I never thought, I never thought
All time what
Things break apart, things break apart

Man, she pulled out the rug from her doodlebug
Rolling down the highway
Not a worry in her mind
Here's a flash card where someone's written stultify
I take it as a sign
It's hard to redefine
Same old sad soliloquy
They handed me a broom
The cast has left the room

All time what
Stumble about wrapped in a shroud
All time what
Partly submerged playing a dirge

Complete completely completelier
Defeat defeated defeatlier
Complete completely completelier
Defeat defeated defeatlier

All time what
I never thought, I never thought
All time what
Things break apart, things break apart
