Hey Kirby
Whatcha doing Kirby
Whatcha doing there

Hobgoblin, shots of hot Sriracha
Vaccine queen deem church socks hostage
Nine weeks awesome
Hides in a slipper
Look in her eye like she might be a wizard
Cold met a cat lady in a parking lot, she got the heroes of tomorrow in a cardboard box
And probably hoarding forty more in the corners of Fort Knox
Swapped twenty on the spot and copped the warlock
Back at the haunt, found God in the hamper
Briefs on her head playing 'look-it' with a panther
Good around misery and golden era samplers
Jeopardy and Wheel at the heels of her handlers
Bet more than a pet to worship, it's an M.D. recommended sense of purpose
Here to bat around keys in the means to euphoria
Soon to be held, the greatest of all warriors

Hey Kirby
Whatcha doing Kirby
Whatcha doing there
Hey Kirby
Whatcha doing Kirby
Why'd ya eat that leaf

Homie don't fetch, only woke to stretch
Under a thought bubble rich with bowls of goldfish
Skittish in the company of stranger danger
Otherwise, chase drawstrings, tails and lasers
In a steel cage match with a maze of cables
Brazen, game face based on Azazel
Oversized ears up, puke in the Meow Mix
Shred a pair of earbuds, remedy his cowlick
Thanks Kirbs, lookin' like a milly
Keep an old man sharp, keep a cold Chantilly
Spun plum dizzy in a frisky moment
Never lands on her feet though, I think she's broken
Mouser in training, nap on the toaster
Decorate her cubicle with dogs playing poker
Fifteen years taking prescriptions
Now a shrink like, "I don't know, maybe get a kitten"
