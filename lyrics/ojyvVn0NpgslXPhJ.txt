I don't wanna look
Like some kind of fool
I don't wanna break
My heart over you

I'm building a wall
Everyday it's getting higher
This time I won't end up
Another victim of love

You say that I could show some emotion
That I've been keeping secrets from you
But I can see through all your sweet talk
And all of your affection untrue

I'm gonna find you out
If I scream and I shout
You won't break down my protection

I don't wanna look
Like some kind of fool
I don't wanna break
My heart over you

I'm building a wall
Everyday it's getting higher
This time I won't end up
Another victim of love

I'm gonna lock up what I'm feeling inside
Ain't no way you can break down the door
'Cause this time I've learned my lesson
You can take this declaration of war

Step right back
Put on your coat and your hat
Gonna avoid all complications

I don't wanna look
Like some kind of fool
I don't wanna break
My heart over you

I'm building a wall
Everyday it's getting higher
This time I won't end up
Another victim of love

I don't wanna look
Like some kind of fool
I don't wanna break
My heart over you

I'm building a wall
Everyday it's getting higher
This time I won't end up
Another victim of love

I don't wanna look
Like some kind of fool
I don't wanna break
My heart over you

I'm building a wall
Everyday it's getting higher
This time I won't end up
Another victim of love

I don't wanna look
Like some kind of fool
I don't wanna break
My heart over you
