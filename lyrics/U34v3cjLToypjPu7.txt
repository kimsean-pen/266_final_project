Fight these eyes
They're drawing you inside

Sign the name in marker
Watch the clouds as they got darker
Felt it start to slip away

All the schemes were made and plotted
All the rules have been forgotten now
I made it by the skin of my teeth again this time

I'm waiting, still waiting
To get away and make a change
Seasons last forever in this phase

Forget your heart
It's weighing you down inside
As you confide your life to someone else

Maybe we're scared to be alone
We're not prepared to throw the stones
To watch them drift out of our control

I braced my body for the sudden impact
That was more than I
Ever thought that it would be

And when it knocked me over
I've never felt more stiff than sober now
I'm struggling to get up and run away

I'm wasting, I'm wasting
My life away, I've got to change
I've gotta burn the book and turn the page

Forget your heart
It's weighing you down inside
As you confide your life to someone else

Maybe we're scared to be alone
We're not prepared to throw the stones
To watch them drift out of our control

There's no return
To what you had when you started
Before you lost control, you will never recover

Fight these eyes
They're drawing you inside
Lay down and pretend you're dead
Lay down before you lose control
Lay down and pretend you're dead
Lay down before you lose control
Forget your heart
It's weighing you down inside
As you confide your life to someone else
Maybe we're scared to be alone
We're not prepared to throw the stones
To watch them drift out of our control
