I wont pity you
I'm gonna turn you in
I'm made of plasiticne
I hear your call to me
I'm gonna turn away
Cause it was all your fault
I'm gonna turn you in
Cause it was all your fault

My mistake, my mistake, mistake
My mistake, my mistake
To believe, to believe

I wont pity you
I'm gonna turn you in
I'm made of plasiticne
I hear your call to me
I'm gonna turn away
Cause it was all your fault
And now I'm here to stay
And now its all gone
