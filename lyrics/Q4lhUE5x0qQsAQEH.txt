Sally was a fifteen year old girl from Nebraska
Gypsies were passing through her little town
They dropped something on the road, she picked it up...
And cultural revolution right away begun!
Oh no, cultural revolution just begun
Oh no, cultural revolution just begun

They always were afraid that I was schizophrenic...
They always were afraid schto ja rodinu prodal
a po pravde ja bil prosto malenkij medvedik
sel na velosipedik i vsjo nahuj proebal...
Oh no, cultural revolution just begun
Oh no, cultural revolution just begun

From all the tables of contents that Mother Earth provides
I'd like to be a big fat f.ucking fly
The one that spins around your head all day and all night
and sound of it is just like a what?...
...but by the accident of some kind divine dispensation
I ended up being walking United Nation
And I survive even f.ucking radiation
A big fat f.ucking what?
And I would visit you a lot
