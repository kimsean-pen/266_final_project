I've got a friend
She calls me brother
There ain't nobody we can not live without
We don't need nothing
Except each other
But there's no reason to say it at loud

The moon is there for you tonight
I feel the beating of heart and
You should forget it for a while
We're not just friends
I know you want me to stop the time, time
To stop the time, time

I've got enough
Don't wanna know if
It leads to nothing, you won't give it a chance
Leaving your life
I need to tell you
You could have known it's gonna be the last dance

The moon is there for you tonight
I feel the beating of heart and
You should forget it for a while
We're not just friends
I know you want me to stop the time, time
To stop the time, time
To stop the time
(I've got a friend
She calls me brother) Time
(I've got a friend
She calls me brother) Time
