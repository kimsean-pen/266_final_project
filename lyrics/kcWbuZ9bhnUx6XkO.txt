I know the season's ain't been changing
and everyday it looks like rain
but I keep hoping for that sun

The streets are filled with demons
lord that's thats never gonna change
But I still wanna be with everyone

I know there's something for you out there in this life
I know there's something for you out there in this life

The rivers are getting low
and the skyscrapers all cover the town
But I still work until the day's done

The people all dressed in black,
and all the cars they look the same
But I got nowhere left to run

I know there's something for you out there in this life
I know there's something for you out there in this life
I know there's something waiting for us in this life
I know there's something waiting for us in this life

Oh they're dancing through the darkness of the night
Oh they're dancing through the darkness of the night
Oh they're dancing through the darkness
Oh they're dancing through the darkness
Oh they're dancing through the darkness of the night

I know there's something for you out there in this life
I know there's something for you out there in this life
I know there's something for you out there in this life
I know there's something for you out there in this life
