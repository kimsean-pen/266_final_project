My lands are infectious
Your sun begin to gloom
You see my harful country
And my sky is black today
Pay the price for your life
Your ticket to open gate to die

Voivod! I'm a paranoid
Voivod! The wine of blood
Voivod! I'm a crazy god
Voivod! The ferocious dog

My eyes fix your soul
I like it coz it's too late to go
When I relish, I'm a beast
When I torture, you freeze
And if you see your angel
Contaminate him with cancer

Voivod! I'm a paranoid
Voivod! The wine of blood
Voivod! I'm a crazy god
Voivod! The ferocious dog

I'm a nuclear creature
For atomic fight

Come with me in my spider line
In the black hole of the night
Your visit is short today
Don't worry in the terror you stay
And if you don't trust me
I'll chop your body to eat

Voivod! I'm a paranoid
Voivod! The wine of blood
Voivod! I'm a crazy god
Voivod! The ferocious dog
Voivod!
Voivod!
Voivod! Come with me
Voivod!
