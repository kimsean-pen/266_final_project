We're back, back with vengeance
You had your moment and now it's time for you all to repent
We're back, with the real shit
So grab your pencil and prepare to take notes on this

Let me show you how to kill like a prodigy
Scratch your dreams like you're down to play the lottery
Watch and make the crowd go dumb like a part of me
Everything I touch turn dust; say goodbye to me
Yo I don't think you're really ready for the realness
White kid with this trophy, got a real shift
From the front to the back, make you feel this

Do you really think I give a fuck?
Because I don't
And let me ask you one more time
You think I give a fuck?
Because I don't
Move out the way so I can spit my shit

You've got a lot of fucking nerve to stand here and judge me when your shit sucks dick
I suggest you take a fucking seat and listen up; I'll only say this once

Cause I'm that OG guaranteed to get shit started
Shut their whole game down and get em restarted
Break a bitch in two, like the sea parted
No love for the weak or the faint hearted
See me standing in the cut, roll another one
You see me in the streets, what it do son?
No strings on me like Toulon

Do you really think I give a fuck?
Because I don't
And let me ask you one more time
You think I give a fuck?
Because I don't
Move out the way so I can spit my shit
You think i give a fuck?
Because i don't
And let me ask you one more time
You think i give fuck?
Because i don't
Move out the way so i can spit my shit

I wanna know, what do you really think?
I wanna know, what do you really think?
You think I give a fuck?
Because I don't
You cannot trust me bitch
You think I give a fuck?
Because I don't
