I can't hold my head up in this dark room anymore
I need a lightning bolt to raise me from this grave
Here comes fresh fire
Fresh fire
Fresh fire.
So infatuated by the darkness
And so surrounded the light
Oh, my God save my soul
And still I want what's pure and want what's right
But I need another fix tonight
Oh, my God save my soul
Beneath her glowing eyes
They call like fire to a moth
The most disgusting lies
Are dressed in beauty that'll rot
Oh my God you've won
The coldest battle we fought
Deliverence is mine
From all this beauty that'll rot, rot
"Mirror, mirror on the wall
Will there be glory if I fall?"
Oh, my God save my soul
I need a faith that's solid as concrete
But the impact's broken both my knees
Oh, my God save my soul
Beneath her glowing eyes
They call like fire to a moth
The most disgusting lies
Are dressed in beauty that'll rot
Oh my God you've won
The coldest battle we fought
Deliverence is mine
From all this beauty that'll rot, rot
(Don't wanna rot)
I can't hold my head up in this dark room anymore
I need a lightning bolt to raise me from this grave
Here comes fresh fire
Breath taking, blinding truth
Freedom I never knew
Oh, my God you've won
The coldest battle we fought
Deliverence is mine
From all this beauty that'll rot, rot
