I'll give you love
The things you want
Ohhh... Ahh...

I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you

Sitting at home another lonely night
Wish you were here so I can hold you tight
Pain in my heart because I'm all alone
Why did you leave
Why did your love have to go
When I would do anything for you
I would

Thinking of ways that I can win your heart
But I'm so confused I don't know where to start
Visions of love forever in my mind
I wait for the day when I can say that love's mine
'Cos I would do anything for you
Yes I would

I'll give you love (I'll give you love)
The things you want (the things you want)
Baby there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
See I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you

So what can I do to prove I need your love
What will it take because I won't give up
Open your heart and let your feelings show
'Cos deep down inside my heart just won't let you go
Girl, I would do anything for you
Yes I would

I'll give you love (I'll give you love)
The things you want (the things you want)
Baby there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you

So if there ever comes a time
When it's true love you hope to find
Just call out my name
And, girl, I swear I would do anything
I'll give you love

I'll give you love (oh I'll give you love girl)
I'll give you love (oh I'll give you love girl)
I'll give you love (oh I'll give you love girl)
I'll give you love (oh I'll give you love girl)

(I would do anything for you)
I sayin' I would do babe
(I would do anything for you)
Anything for you babe
(I would do anything, girl, anything for you)
Anything, girl, anything for you
I said I give you love baby (I'll give you love)
Oh, anything you want my baby (the things you want)
Girl, I'll give, I'll give, I'll give, I'll give, I'll give it to you (ohhhh... ahh...)
See I would do (anything for you)
I swear I would do babe (I would do anything for you)
Anything for you babe (I would do anything, girl, anything for you)
Anything, girl, anything for you

I'll give you love (I'll give you love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh I'll give you love (the things you want)
I swear I'll give you love babe
