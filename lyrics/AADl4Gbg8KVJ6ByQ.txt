I was alone so long
I didn't even know that I was lonely
Out in the cold so long
I didn't even know that I was cold
Turned my collar to the wind
This is how it's always been

All I've ever known is how to hold my own
All I've ever known is how to hold my own
But now I wanna hold you, too

You take me in your arms
And suddenly there's sunlight all around me
Everything bright and warm
And shining like it never did before
And for a moment I forget
Just how dark and cold it gets

All I've ever known is how to hold my own
All I've ever known is how to hold my own
But now I wanna hold you
Now I wanna hold you
Hold you close
I don't ever wanna have to let you
goNow I wanna hold you, hold you tight
I don't wanna go back to the lonely life

Say that you'll hold me forever
Say that the wind won't change on us
Say that we'll stay with each other
And it'll always be like this

I'm gonna hold you forever
The wind will never change on us
As long as we stay with each other
Then it will always be like this
