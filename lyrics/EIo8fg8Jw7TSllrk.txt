Don't look back
You know there's no way back
For you

You make your pact
With a life of railing back
And the one's who tried in vain to help

You left your heart
Fading down below
You're holding on
You just can't let go

You've got your back
You never needed that
Oh, but look at you

Just don't push back
Oh, we just want you back
From the life that claimed the life of

You left your heart
Beating far below
You're holding on
You just can't let go
You can't let go
You can't let go

You left your heart
Waiting down below
You left your heart
Beating far below
You left your heart
You can't let go
