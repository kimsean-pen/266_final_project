Yeah (ah-ah)
One, two, three, four

She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah
Tight dress with the top cut low
She's addicted to the feeling of letting go, oh-woah (let it go)

She walks in and the room just lights up
But she don't want anyone to know
That I'm the only one that gets to take her home, oh-woah (take her home)

But every time I tell her that I want more
She closes the door

She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of fallin' in love?

She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of f-f-fallin' in love, oooh

Maybe she's just trying to test me
Wanna see how hard I'm gonna work
Wanna see if I can really tell how much she's worth (what you're worth)

Or maybe all her friends have told her
"Don't get closerâ€”he'll just break your heart"
But either way she's teasing me and it's just so hard (so hard)

'Cause every time I tell her how I feel
She says it's not real

She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of fallin' in love?

She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of f-f-fallin' in love, oooh

What about all the things we said
Talking on the phone so late (so late)
I can't let her get away from me, oooh

When I say that I can do it no more
She's back in my door

(She's not afraid) She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild (running wild)
How come she's so afraid of fallin' in love? (falling in love)

She's not afraid of scary movies (she's not afraid)
She likes the way we kiss in the dark (kiss in the dark)
But she's so afraid of f-f-fallin' in love, oooh

She's not afraid
She's not afraid
Ooohhh
Ooohhh
