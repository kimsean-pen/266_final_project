You did the trick
I didn't see it coming
I did not hear a sound

Though you were quick
I will not be forgiving

You won't be waiting for my return
I promise baby - You'll burn

Now it snows in hell
This is the day foretold till death do us apart
Now it snows in hell
I've gone away but I've got you in my heart
All frozen and scarred

Your life goes on
and it's infuriating
How did you not get caught

Your deed will spawn
a fate beyond your making

You won't be waiting for my return
I promise baby - You'll burn

Now it snows in hell - We're done masquerading
This is the day foretold till death do us apart
Now it snows in hell - No you won't be waiting
I've gone away but I've got you in my heart
All frozen and scarred

You shouldn't visit me at my grave
My hands will grab you through the dirt
I giveth - I taketh away
Witness my rebirth from the devils churn

Hell - We're done masquerading
This is the day foretold till death do us apart
Now it snows in hell - No you won't be waiting
I've gone away but I've got you in my heart
All frozen and scarred
Hell - We're done masquerading
This is the day foretold till death do us apart
Now it snows in hell - No you won't be waiting
I've gone away but I've got you in my heart
All frozen and scarred
