Terrified
Terrified

I don't mind being alone
I'm a giant inside of these walls
No, I never met one worth the fall
So I'm not fucking with any at all

'Cause on the outside, I'm smiling like I've never been stung
But on the inside, I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
You know I like to play it off, but don't pretend that I'm dumb
That's why I run, that's why I run-run-run-run-run

I'm not afraid of love,
I'm terrified
It never feels like how they advertise
It's got big teeth, it's got an appetite
I'm not afraid of love
Not afraid of love
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-terrified
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-terrified
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-terrified
I'm not afraid of love, I'm terrified

I should like being alone
'Cause if I love you, I'm letting you go
No, I'll never get sick of the fall
So addicted to losing it all

'Cause on the outside, I'm smiling like I've never been stung
But on the inside, I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
You know I like to play it off, but don't pretend that I'm dumb
That's why I run
That's why I run-run-run-run-run

I'm not afraid of love
I'm terrified
It never feels like how they advertise
It's got big teeth, I know I've seen it bite
I'm not afraid of love
Not afraid of love
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-terrified
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-terrified
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-terrified
I'm not afraid of love, I'm terrified

I'm not afraid, I'm kinda scared
If it's locked away, can't hurt me here (Hey)
I'm not afraid, no need to hide
I'm running, running, running, running 'til I die

T-t-t-t-t-t-t-terrified
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-terrified
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-terrified
I'm not afraid of love, I'm terrified
