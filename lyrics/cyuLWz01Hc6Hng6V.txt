So I packed up my life into the boot of your car
I must have driven for an hour or two before I hit the bar

It terrifies me how you used to love to get me down
I'm really sorry that I took your
car, but I just had to get out of town.

It wasn't one specific thing you did,
it wasn't one specific thing that you said
But as we laid there on your bed,
all the feelings that I'd hid came to surface in my head.

And in your glove compartment, there's nothing but old cassettes
I put one on and I hear this song that I wrote for you when we met

It mystifies me how I used to let you get me down
I'm so sorry that I took your car but I just had to get out of town.
