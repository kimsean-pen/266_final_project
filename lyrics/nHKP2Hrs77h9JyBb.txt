Hang with a narcissist
Check something off my list
Before that I was stuck at home
Throw out your telephone
Ran with the wolves at night
Straight outta boys don't cry
Crashing the speed away
Staying at the games we play

Speak out in a different language
Don't mind, I can't take my eyes off it
We were wanting to grow up every weekend
Now we're watching the moments as they're leaving

Losing the feeling now
Laugh when I hit the ground
And searching in the dark
Saying that she isn't on

I don't ever wanna go
Living in a memory, nothing to show
That I can let it get away hanging out the window
Nothing to say

Speak out in a different language
Don't mind, I can take my eyes off it
We will run in to grow up every weekend
Now we're watching the moments as they're leaving

Don't let them take away all the games we played
Go on and take a bow, 'cause it's over now

Speak out in a different language
Don't try, I can take my mind off it
We will run in to grow up every weekend
Now we're watching the moments as they're leaving
