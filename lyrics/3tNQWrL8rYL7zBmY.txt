Before we draw
My dear, dear friend
I promise you my word
If we should part
My dear, dear love
You know you're in my heart
And though I may be getting older
Know that I'm coming with you
Know that I'm hanging onto
The things that you said

I felt my soul
Rise up from my body
When I look into your blue eyes
If cosmic force is real at all
It's come between you and I
I want to be naked
I don't mean my body
I don't need my body
I'm floating away
