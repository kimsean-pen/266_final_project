You're scanning the landscape...
You feel like a true pioneer
As Romans you conquer
On top of your fear

(Just) hope you awaken in time
And know that you are on my mind
Look over your shoulders - you're blind!
And circle the wagons

(Just) hope you awaken in time
And know that you are on my mind
Look over your shoulders - you're blind!
And circle the wagons

20 years later
I take you apart
You're asking - you're asking why?
I have no heart!

(Just) hope you awaken in time
And know that you are on my mind
Look over your shoulders - you're blind!
And circle the wagons...

(Just) hope you awaken in time
And know that you are on my mind
Look over your shoulders - you're blind!
And then!
Circle the wagons...
