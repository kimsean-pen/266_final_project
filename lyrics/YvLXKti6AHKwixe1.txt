In every hour every day
This chosen solitude is gone
The pressure coursing
Through your every nerve
Will rise and fade away
Rise and fade away
Will rise and fade away
There's madness to this method
Conformity now on display
When confidence become the enemy
In time our questions lose their meaning
Wish it away and it comes back to you somehow
A loneliness denied
A loneliness denied
Our shallow pool of wisdom
Reflects upon our innocent face
Between attacks of pure anxiety
You see humanity slip away
You force the lie to be an absolute
To where there will be no return
To where there will be no return
To be an absolute
There will be no return
There is a face on the surface
I don't ever want to see
There is a light above the water
That is not supposed to be
If there is truth in this resistance
I don't ever want to know
