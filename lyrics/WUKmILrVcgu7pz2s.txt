Day dreaming
The wind in my hair
The soft tender air
No worries no cares in you
Day scemming
Escape to the dreams
To hide from the good
Just Wana spent time
With you

Laying side by side
With ketchafire in the radio
Yeah we get so high
Cause we got no place to go
Il never say goodbye.
And you ain't never gonna be alone

The promise we make
The promise we broke
But I still remember that summer
Ohhh the taste of your lips
When the sun went down so sweet
And I could exist in that summer
Ohhh Close my eye and get lost in the memory

And
just drift away

I stay dreaming
As day turns to night
I look in your eyeS
I know it's for life verse two?
So we stay scheming
The people we see the places we meet
The people we meet
A house built by the beach pitter pat of feet
All that I need yeahh

Laying sided by side Santiria on the radio
Yeah we get so high
Cause we ain't got not place to go
Il never say goodbye
And you ain't never gonna be alone
The promise we made the promise we broke
But I still remember that summer
Ohhh the taste of you lips
When the sun went down so sweet
And I could exist in that summer
Ohh close my eyes and get lost in the memory

And
just drift away yeah
day dreaming so sweetly
Just drift away
Day dreaming so sweetly

Oh just drift away
