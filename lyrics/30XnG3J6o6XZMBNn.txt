Sometimes it's hard to say the right thing
The right way on the hardest day of your life
Breathe in, breathe out, it'll be okay
Breathe in, breathe out, I know it's hard to say

And every year November gets closer
And every year it gets a little bit colder
Breathe in, breathe out, it'll be okay
Be strong, hold on, make it through the day

One step at a time
One foot in front of the other
I'm gonna get through this one way or another
Cause I know it's warmer where you are
Cause no matter how far the view
I still always look up to you

The sun takes a second to sink in
That your life will never gonna be the same again
Breathe in, breathe out, it'll be okay
Breathe in, they say the pain will fade away

And every year November gets closer
And every year it gets a little bit colder
Breathe in, breathe out it'll be okay
Be strong, hold on, make it through the day

One step at a time
One foot in front of the other
I'm gonna get through this one way or another
Cause I know it's warmer where you are
Cause no matter how far the view
I still always look up to you

I'll never forget the day my heart fell from my chest
It was the moment that I said goodbye
And I laid your body to rest
I'll never take this life for granted
I'm living it for two
And since you're always the one who sang the songs
And I'll be singing this one for you

One step at a time
One foot in front of the other
I'm gonna get through this one way or another
Cause I know it's warmer where you are
Cause no matter how far the view
I still always look up to you
I'll always look up to you
