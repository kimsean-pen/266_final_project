Since you hide, since you steal
Since you hate everything I feel
Since you cheat, since you lie
Since you don't wanna try things I wanna try

Since you been gone
My life has moved along quite nicely actually

I've got a lot more friends and I don't have to pretend
Since you're gone, since you're gone

Since you're not what I want
You can take everything I've got
Take a seat, take the drive
If I say I love you, I am a liar

Since you been gone
My life has moved along quite nicely actually

Meet my lover Jen and I don't have to pretend
Since you're gone, since you're gone

I've been looking for a new direction, anyway
I've been looking for my own protection to save

Now that you're gone my life has moved along
Now that you're gone my life has moved along
Now that you're gone my life has moved along
Now that you're gone
Since you hide, since you steal

Since you hate everything I feel
Since you cheat, since you lie
Since you don't wanna try things I wanna try

Since you been gone
My life has moved along quite nicely actually

Quite nicely actually, quite nicely actually
Quite nicely actually, quite nicely actually
Quite nicely actually, thanks for asking
Quite nicely
