You did everything I asked you not to
Look where it got you
I'm sure you heard it before
But how could you? And baby, why would you?

Goodbye sweetheart, countdown started
Words are heavy but I'm far from broken hearted
Goodbye stranger, I'll take the fall
Lies were tempting though you
Never really threw me off at all

Go ahead, waste your time, count me out
Take your place at the end of the line
Raise a glass, no surprise
Here's to us at the end of the line
Here's to us at the end of the line

I'll miss the version of you
Who loved me and all that they don't see
You said you could be good
Somehow you're guilty and you're not even sorry

Goodbye sweetheart, countdown started
Words are heavy but I'm far from broken hearted
Goodbye stranger, I'll take the fall
Your lies were tempting though you
Never really threw me off at all

Go ahead, waste your time, count me out
Take your place at the end of the line
Raise a glass, no surprise
Here's to us at the end of the line
Here's to us at the end of the line

Go ahead, waste your time, count me out
Take your place at the end of the line
Raise a glass, no surprise
Here's to us at the end of the line
Here's to us at the end of the line
