We move more than I would like to gamble
I came with my poor poor eyes crawling weakling warning
my favorite come and lie here
Under my bed or deep under my fingers

Well on my hands and knees in times of winding
We night it's only when we civilize that worm
for vagrant time we need it
What secret of your knowing is their begining

For chance to be old believe it believe it
His widow's nest is growing cold, cold, cold
Set sail and hurt your hand he work a lot, you're going home
