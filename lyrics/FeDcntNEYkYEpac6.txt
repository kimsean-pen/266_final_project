Who fuses the music
With no illusions
Producing the blue prints
Clueless?
Automator defy the laws of nature
Electronic monolith throw a jam upon the disc
The futuristic looper with the quickness
Hyper producing, hydrogen fusion liquids keep your distance

First we coerce your brain patterns
Collaborate with time consume and reprogram it
I apply the flow cannon
The combo so slamin
Atomically reconstruct the old canvas
His logic impress
A hypnotic effect
Ya latent patent you could call it a gift
Man he all in the mix nuclear physicist
Genetically tailored every bit of this stimulus

the day the walls of the cities
crumble away
uncovering our naked souls
all start singing
shouting
screaming

Psyonically bionically forget how you feel
Especially formulated the rest of you fornicated
It takes more to make this
He juggles variables
Unparalleled propulsion to carry the load
Neural surgeon the purest virgin conducting currents
Musical Merlin he shines like sterling
Watch the Automator draw laser of a higher intensity
And instantly miss a beat create a symphony

Hey I know now
repeat
automator's on the planet earth
and he's gonna stop the war of the worlds
(now how will he do that)
Deltron Zero is here as well to put it together for real
(that's pretty good man)
Yeah, ee told y'all, he would do as he is truly gifted in the matters of rhythm
Ya you got to give him that
Ya you got to give him dap
With his infinite wisdom you know you got to get with him
