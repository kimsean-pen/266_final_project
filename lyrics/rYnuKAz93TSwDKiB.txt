Lost on a voyage with no destiny
Forgotten original ideology

Generations born and died
Their intentions misplaced through time
Another world falls to its knees
With vast contempt your hatred breads

There's nowhere left for us to slaughter
Annihilation achieved
Where next to conquer?

Civilizations of the past
Faced attrition now ripped apart
Moving onwards to another war
Into battle to die once more

An endless spiral of depravity
Mankind's journey throughout infinity

Where next to conquer?
