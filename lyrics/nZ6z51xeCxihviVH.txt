You make it so easy
When you're making it rough
You won't make no promises
But you can't get enough

I feel like I'm standing
In the headlight beam
You come on like thunder
I know what this means

It's unholy love
Oh can't you see
This unholy love
You know is killing me

The sting of confusion
Then a kiss from your lips
You don't make it painless
And you don't make it quick

I hold on forever
Till I feel the sweet rush start
Then you're holding me closer
While you're breaking my heart

It's unholy love
Baby can't you see
It's unholy love
So good it's killing me

It's unholy love
Oh can't you see
This unholy love
You know is killing me

I feel like I'm standing
In the headlight beam
You come on like thunder
I know what this means

It's unholy love
This unholy love
You know is killing me
Baby can't you see
This unholy love
Is, said is killing me
