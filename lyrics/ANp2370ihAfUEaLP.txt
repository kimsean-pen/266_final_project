I could watch you for a lifetime
You're my favorite movie
A thousand endings
You mean everything to me
I never know what's coming
Forever fascinating
Hope you don't stop running
To me 'cause I'll always be waiting

You are a cinema I could watch you forever
Action-thriller, I could watch you forever
You are a cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
A cinema, a cinema (a cinema.)

Get up, get down
Lose that sound
My DJ gonna break it down
Get up, get down
Lose that sound
Drop the bass

Stars spell out your name
Like in a science fiction drama
Romance roll in
Like a flower in the summer
You always keep me guessing
Forever my wonder
Hope you start undressing
All my dreams until the end of

You are a cinema I could watch you forever
Action-thriller, I could watch you forever
You are a cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
A cinema, a cinema (a cinema.)

Get up, get down
Lose that sound
My DJ gonna break it down
Get up, get down
Lose that sound
Drop the bass

You are a cinema I could watch you forever
Action-thriller, I could watch you forever
You are a cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
A cinema, a cinema (a cinema.)
