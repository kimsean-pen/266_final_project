Always dream
Big dreams
That's what you were saying
"Until when?"
Finishing the glass of milkshake

I know... for sure
I know what love is

You're always running
With seat on the forehead
You're standing, tilting your head
On the corner of the avenue

I know... for sure
I know what love is

Kiss me now
Stop crying now
Smile, as always
And count the stars

I know... for sure
I know what love is

Always look forward to tomorrow
And live on
That's you
