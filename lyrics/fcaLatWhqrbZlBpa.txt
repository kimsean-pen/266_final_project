Lost time is never found again

Lost time is never found again
But they say time heals all wounds
And I keep digging at mine
I keep digging at mine

Lost time is never found again
And they say the past is in the past
But I keep digging up mine
I keep digging up mine

I'm finding pieces, fighting pieces of me
I'll never take for granted the life given to me
I left before and I was never coming
back, beaten, defeated destined for this path

Whatever happened to the things we cared for
Whatever happened to the things we use to love
Whatever happened to the long nights sleepless
I thought it'd never end, we thought it'd never end

The days are flying by like when we were younger
The days are getting longer so much fucking longer
I wouldn't change what happened to me
Because my story's stronger, so much fucking stronger

I'm finding pieces, fighting pieces of me
I'll never take for granted the life given to me
I left before and I was never coming
back, beaten, defeated destined for this path

Whatever happened to the things we cared for
Whatever happened to the things we use to love
Whatever happened to the long nights sleepless
I thought it'd never end, we thought it'd never end

Now things are getting harder, so much fucking harder
Now time is moving faster, so much fucking faster

Lost time is never found again
It's never found again
But we can start again

What ever happened to the things we cared for
What ever happened to the things we use to love
What ever happened to the long nights sleepless
I thought it'd never end, we thought it'd never end
