Are you with me?
I can't see a thing
Darling, are you with me?
What happened to the light you used to bring?

Can you feel me?
Can you hear me through the hum?
Darling, are you with me?
You've got this light
You've got this life and I want some

If you're with me then let's leave now
If you're with me then let's leave now
If you're with me then let's leave now
If you're with me then let's leave now
Let's leave now

Are you with me?
Have you been with me all the time?
I sent a message to your memory last night
It read I'll see you somewhere down the line

If you're with me then let's leave now
If you're with me then let's leave now
If you're with me then let's leave now
If you're with me then let's leave now

If you forgive me then let's leave now
If you forgive me then let's leave now
If you forgive me then let's leave now
If you forgive me then let's leave now
Let's leave now
Let's leave now
Let's leave now
Let's leave now

Are you with me?
I hear you singing
At least I think that's you
Darling, are you with me?
Please stop the bad dreams from coming true
