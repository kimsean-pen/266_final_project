Your body lies without a twitch, can't move
Feeling gone, nothing to say or do
Still alive but you can't think or see
You're looking like a vegetable to me

The darkness lives forever within your mind

Time rolls by and you never paid the cost
Without your mind, your body, it's lost
Should we help to keep you alive?
Now's the time to help you, haha, die!

The darkness lives forever within your mind
No dreams, no thoughts, it's only endless time
