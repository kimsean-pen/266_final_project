Twisted and dirty
Think that you know me
That you control me
Have it figured it out
Boy I'm not breaking
Better get praying
You need the saving
To keep you devout

I told you once
I told you twice
I can't be tricked
Can't be hypnotized
You tell me I'm pretty when
I'm sitting here in silence

Don't try and tell me what a girl wants
Shut up and give it to me
You got the picture painted all wrong
No, I won't be your masterpiece

Don't feed me lies
I'll chew them up and spit em out
Don't try and tell me what a girl wants
Shut up and give it to me

Sick and perverted
Nobody's perfect
This shit ain't worth it
I'm calling you out
You calling me crazy
Then calling me baby
Like its gonna change things
But I figured it out

I told you once
I told you twice
I can't be tricked
Can't be hypnotized
You tell me I'm ready when
I'm sitting here in silence

Don't try and tell me what a girl wants
Shut up and give it to me
You got the picture painted all wrong
No, I won't be your masterpiece

Don't feed me lies
I'll chew them up and spit em out
Don't try and tell me what a girl wants
Shut up and give it to me

Shut up and give it to me
Shut up and give it to me

If you really give a fuck about me
You'd shut your mouth and you'd let me speak
You only care bout what you want for me
What you want for me
Not what I want for me

If you really give a fuck about me
You'd shut your mouth and you'd let me speak
You only care bout what you want for me
What you want for me
Not what I want for me

Don't try and tell me what a girl wants
Shut up and give it to me
You got the picture painted all wrong
No, I won't be your masterpiece

Don't feed me lies
I'll chew them up and spit em out
Don't try and tell me what a girl wants
Shut up and give it to me

If you really give a fuck about me
You'd shut up and give it to me
Shut your mouth and let me speak

If you really give a fuck about me
You'd shut up and give it to me
Don't try and tell me what a girl wants
Shut up and give it to me
