I was waitin'
In the darkness
Hallowin', hallowin'
And I was prayin'

For some light
Inside of it
Let me in

Fallen like a racehorse
Tryna' keep the chase on
Never seein' who's wrong
There's somethin' in your eyes

That makes me hypnotized
And darlin', I will say now
If you wanna calm down
Listen to my voice now

Listen for the signs
We'll play it out in time
We'll play it out in time
Said I...

I was prayin'
To the skies for anything, anything
You were fading like a flower, withering
Why won't you let me in?

Fallen like a racehorse
Tryna' keep the chase on
Never seein' who's wrong
There's somethin' in your eyes

That makes me hypnotized
And darling, I will say now
If you wanna calm down
Listen to my voice now

Listen for the signs
We'll play it out in time
We'll play it out in time

Salt beneath the wound, I cry
To wash away the pain for you
Try to take away the beast
I heard him all the time, I do

And I do it again
And I do it again
