Let go
Of all that you perceive
Everything's not as it seems
Let go
Of all that you perceive
Everything's not as it seems

See today for what it is
Not what it can give
Make your way
You're lost within
That's no way to live

Good we've given
Bad we've committed
But we believe we're all forgiven

The mark of the man
Is not where he stands
Where he stands
Where he stands
When all is right in the world
It's what he does when the chilling wind
Threatens to break down his door

Inhale the bravery
Exhale the worry
His life on the edge but his soul survives
His sanity is stolen but he's civil inside

They hold his feet to the fire
Hoping he'll be inspired

The rocks at the bottom
Will know your name

Don't let shame replace who you'll be
With who you are
Contempt is a weak metal for building
Anything of wonder

Ask a man on his death bed
What he truly believes
He will say, it's not the trophies
Or the places he's seen

The unanswered questions
Leave the greatest impression

Let go of all that you perceive
Everything is not what it seems
