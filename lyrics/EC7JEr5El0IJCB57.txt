Lies, broken dreams, the dismal past
Is there more in life? I should've known
Ending wars, when in pain
When in love, mankind is insane

And there's all these possibilities
Some will fail and some will achieve
Even though in my youth
I didn't know, but what can I do?

And I may not ever see
In my pain, my suffering
Cannot live for the rest of my life
D.N.R. do not resuscitate me

Life, lost unseen, behind the mask
And with open arms will I grasp
Open doors, open minds
Ending all the madness I hate

And I may not ever see
In my pain, my misery
Cannot live for the rest of my life
D.N.R. do not resuscitate me
D.N.R.

Wings of sadness will hold my prayers
All this madness will end my fears
Contempt in life, conceptualize
Wrong or right, the ending of life
God, save me now

Time, end it now, no going back
Can you see the light as you pass?
Ending wars, when in pain
Waiting all my life to be saved

And I will not ever see
All the pain and suffering
Cannot live for the rest of my life
D.N.R. do not resuscitate me
D.N.R.
