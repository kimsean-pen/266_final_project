I'd be bad to feel so bad
Waking up laughing so rare
Up and down and down the stairs
Set myself up in the chair

And said all I love is all I love
All I want is all I want

If we make the same mistake
Who could we blame
When we make the same mistake
Who will we blame
Who will we blame
What will we blame?

We blame all I love
All I love
All we want
All we want

I had a healthy discussion
I had a sleep in the chair
I laid my head on a cushion
Because it was there
I had a flame in the dark
It was...
Up and down and down the stairs
Set myself up in the chair

And said all I love is
All I love
All I want
Is all I want
(You've got the hands)
All I love
(To hold the key)
Is all I love
All I want
(You've got the hands)
Is all I want
(To hold the key)

If we make the same mistakes
Who could we blame
When we make the same mistake
Who could we blame
Who will we blame
What could we blame?
When we make
The same mistake
Who will we blame?...
