Breathe in the air now,
a harmony of woe.
Blindly lead the like mind,
feel the needs as they grow.
Out of sight,
kept in mind.
Apart,
come ennui.
In your voice,
hear you sink.
Doubt will exhaust your hope.
Fearing your dreams will be washing away.
(I know you will have no regrets, you'll never say I wasn't there)
All what you really want
is me to come to you.
I will be there,
to stand bedore you
face to face,
my strife has brought me home.
(I know you will have no regrets, you'll never say I wasn't there)
Cumbered
by the open road.
Embrace becomes a
lock to keep the bond.
You have
come to loathe me too.
Reaching walls,
racing time by
striding on
through it all.
Doubt will exhaust your hope.
Fearing your dreams will be washing away.
All what you really want
is me to come to you.
I will be there,
to stand bedore you
face to face,
my strife has brought me home.
You know always,
you are my all.
(I know you will have no regrets, you'll never say I wasn't there)
