I feel free, I feel free

Feel, when I dance with you, we move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free, I feel free, I feel free

I can walk down the street but there's no one there
Though the pavement's one huge crowd
I can drive down the road but my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
Yeah, my mind wants to cry out loud

I can walk down the street but there's no one there
Though the pavement's one huge crowd
I can drive down the road but my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
Yeah, my mind wants to cry out loud

As far as I can see, ceiling is the sky
You're the sun and as you shine on me
I feel free, I feel free, I feel free

I feel free, I feel free, I feel free
I feel free, I feel free, I feel free
I feel free, I feel free, I feel free, I feel free, I feel free
