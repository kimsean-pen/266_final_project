When the darkness brings the cold
To draw me under
I am caught between the chapters of a dream
Something's reaching out and my entire world is crumbling
And it whispers that I am
The chosen one...
Can you hear me...?

'Cause when the night begins to fall
I watch the shadows growing tall
Feeding my insomnia
Like a fly on the wall

I'm asleep but wide awake
A nightmare on repeat
In the haze I sense the purpose of my soul
We are all born to leave a scar deep in the hearts of many
But can I really trust that I'm
The chosen one.
Can you hear me...?

'Cause when the night begins to fall
I watch the shadows growing tall
Feeding my insomnia
Like a fly on the wall
(Can you hear me?)

When the night begins to fall
I hear a thousand voices call
Chasing my insanity
Like a fly on the wall

My wide eyed confidence
Still echoes in my mind
A bright white prophecy
Protector of the light

(Can you hear me?)
'Cause when the night begins to fall
I watch the shadows growing tall
Feeding my insomnia
Like a fly on the wall

(Can you hear me?)
When the night begins to fall
I hear a thousand voices call
Chasing my insanity
Like a fly on the wall
