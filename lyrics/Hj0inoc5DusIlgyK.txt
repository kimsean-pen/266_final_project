I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurts to

The show ain't over
They'll keep on going
They'll keep on laughing
And fucking around

Off into the distance
Those two brothers
Those two lovers
And their smooth-cocked adventures

(I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurts to)

They just want to be one
Walk off into the sun
They're not kissing
They're not fucking
They're just having fun

(I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurts to)

They were connected
At the back of the head
They got a conduit
Their minds are the same

This ain't the end
We'll see them again

This is the end of the song, and it is just a song.
It's a version of me and you that can exist outside of everything
else, and if it is just a fantasy,
then anything can happen from here. The contract is up,
the names have been changed.
So pour one out, whoever you are. These are only lyrics now

When I come back you'll still be here
(When you come back I'll still be here)
