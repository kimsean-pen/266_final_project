Daylight to nighttime to sunrise
Through your eyes, through my eyes
To your lips then my lips to your hips
Then our hips are moving in time

Then we kiss!
Then we kiss!

Skyline, your moonlight
The sky boys we kick down
Police cars and sirens are breaking the silence
And two hearts with fire inside

Then we kiss!
Then we kiss!

Hope that's the way to go
How the fuck should I know
Stop here, this is wait
Oh no, you have to pay
Down down down the hill
Tripped over, took er still
Lights out, go and clap
We can be here on top
No baby, don't stop
Let's go get her
Stay here forever
Then we kiss!

Palm trees, a new day
Sunrise is something
That girl, the same place,
Looking for you as always
A tap on the shoulder
It's you

Then we kiss!
Then we kiss!
Then we kiss!
(All I wanna do is have a good time)
Then we kiss!
(All I wanna do is have a good time)
Then we kiss!
