[Lucifer:]
And the fires burn'd inside my eye's
as ye fall's ascending like a moment o' joy.
My thorns where sown in ye light o' Day,
and the winds... they blew...
until my winds, they blew no more.
I scream'd out into the dawn!

[Spirit of Night:]
His thorns were spawned from the grasp o' God,
and the pain... it grew...
but holiness grew no more.
Grievance; fro' the horizon she comes...
I wonder if I could stay in His world,
'cause sooner or later this pain must end!
My life... it cries to be free,
but legions of stars... the stars suffers with me!
Grievance:
Pain must end!
His life cries, but soon to be free...
Thou art the star o' Venus... Oh Seraphim!
The Holy Spirit:
Thou must obey thy father, thy God!
Bow down before his eyes... before his very eye's...!

[Lucifer:]
My God... 'father'... hear us cry!
Tell me why...! Thou wilt die!

[Astaroth:]
Oh, Enslaver of Souls;
Thou can not be our father!
Oh, Avengeful God;
Thou hast brought us agony!

[Lucifer:]
Into heav'n our sorrow...
ye beautiful moment o' tragedy...
Falling fro' the lies of His 'perfect world'.
Takest us away, so far away...
here is nothing but pain.
Farewell now as we enter our darkness...
and we love her, the realization!
Behold our salvation!
Sorrow
so beautiful...
They are falling...
falling!
God is smiling...
smiling!
Salvation comes but pain
still grows...
