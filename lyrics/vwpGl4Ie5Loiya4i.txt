I used to go out to parties
And stand around
'Cause I was too nervous
To really get down

But my body
Yearned to be free
I got up on the floor and thought
Somebody could choose me

No more standin'
There beside the walls
Finally got myself together, baby
And I'm havin' a ball

As long as you're groovin'
There's always a chance
Somebody watchin'
Might wanna make romance

Move your body
Ooh baby, you dance all night
To the groove and
Feel alright

Everybody's groovin'
On like a fool
But if you see me
Spread out and let me in

Baby, just party
High and low
Let me step into
Your erotic zone

Move it up
Turn it 'round
Ooh, shake it down

You can love me when you want to, babe
This is such a groovy party, baby
We're here face to face
Everybody's swingin'
This is such a groovy place

All the young ladies are so fine

You're movin' your body
Easy with no doubts
I know what you thinkin', baby
You wanna turn me out

I think I'm gonna let you do it, babe

Keep on dancin'
You got to get it
Got to give it up
(repeat until end)
