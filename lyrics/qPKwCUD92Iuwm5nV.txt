She gets too hungry for dinner at 8
(I'm starving)
She loves the theater but she never comes late
I never bother with people that I hate

That's why this chick is a tramp
She doesn't like crap games with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
And I definitely won't dish our dirt with the rest of those girls

That's why the lady is a tramp
I love the free fresh wind in my hair
Life without care
Oh, I'm so broke,
It's OK

I hate California. It's crowded and damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
I'm a tramp!
Sometimes I go to Coney Island
Oh, the beach is divine
I love the Yankees
Jeter is just fine
I follow Rogers and Hart
She sings every line
That's why the lady is a tramp
I love the prize fight
That isn't a fake
No fakes
And I love to rowboat with you and your wife in Central Park Lake
She goes to the opera and stays wide awake
Yes I do
That's why this lady is a tramp
She likes the green (green) grass (grass) under her shoes
What can I lose? 'cause I got no dough (Oh no?)
I'm all alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp
Go
I love your free, fresh, I love your handkerchief in my hair
Life without care
But I'm so broke!
That's OK!
Hates California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
That's why this lady is a tramp!
That's why the lady is a tramp ...
