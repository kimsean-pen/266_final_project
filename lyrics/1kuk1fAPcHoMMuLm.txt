Did you know there was a tower
Where they look out to the land
To see the people quickly passing by
This is for their own desire
As they spit down to the earth
To feel the power pouring in their veins

Woh oh oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah
Woh oh oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah

And the black smoke rises
From the fires we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
Stand up in the cold

Many people are dividing
And a world apart with just one heart
Is bound to keel and fade away
None of us will be deciding
And the fate of man is in the hands
Of he who stands and heeds the call

Woh oh oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah
Woh oh oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah

And the black smoke rises
From the fires we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
Stand up in the cold

(We won't stand alone, we will stand up in the cold)
(We won't stand alone, we will stand up in the cold)
Stand up in the cold
(We won't stand alone, we will stand up in the cold)
We won't stand

Yeah

And the black smoke rises
From the fires we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold

And the black smoke rises
From the fires we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
Stand up in the cold
