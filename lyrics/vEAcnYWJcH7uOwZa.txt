You come back home
With a secret smile
A knowin' look
And another lie
To blow my cool
And wreck my life

Don't you corrupted
And totally destructive?
When you erupted
You're totally destructive
(Don't change bombs)

I'd rather not
Have to hear about
Your other girls
On your expense account
I know you carry on
Behind my back
With your secretary
You'll have a heart attack

Don't you corrupted
And totally destructive
When you erupted
You're totally destructive
(Don't drop bombs)
(Babe)

Don't drop bombs
Baby
Don't drop bombs
Don't drop bombs
Baby
Don't drop bombs
Just stay calm
Baby
No more bombs

Life with you
Is all ups and downs
When you're up
You're off, down town
I've had enough

(Babe)
Don't tell me
About your lack of restrictions
Guilty records
And previous convictions
Or I shall start
Playing rough
(Babe)

Don't you corrupted
And totally destructive
When you've erupted
You're totally destructive
(Don't you)

Don't drop bombs
Baby
Don't drop bombs
Just stay calm
Baby
No more bombs

Don't drop bombs
Baby
Don't drop bombs
Just stay calm
Baby
No more bombs
