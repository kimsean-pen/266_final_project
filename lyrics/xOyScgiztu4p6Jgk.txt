So where are you?
It's been a little while

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Lovin' what I'm tastin' (ooh)
Venom on my tongue
Dependent at times
Poisonous vibrations (ooh)
Help my body run
I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Fall out of formation (ooh)
I plan my escape
From walls they confined
Rebel red carnation (ooh)
Grows while I decay
I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life
Yeah, I'm running for my life
Runnin' for my life

Hide you in my coat pocket
Where I kept my rebel red
Felt I was invincible
You wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead
My body lives on lead
The last two lines may read
Incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a papermaker
I despise you sometimes
I love to hate to fight
And you in my life is like

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah

I'm so sorry, I forgot you
Let me catch you up to speed
I've been tested like the ends of
A weathered flag that's by the sea

Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
