I want a girl doesn't want me back
(I cannot believe you)

Try letting go but I can't read maps
(You're back again, you're back again)

Got a new n***** now he can't be found

50 coming and they know my name
(I cannot believe you)

Got a new girl riding and I hope she dead
(You're back again, you're back again)

In these streets we got no shame
(I cannot believe you are back again, you're back again.
I cannot believe you are back again, you're back again.
When I'm somewhere else.
Then to look away.
Never watching out.)

All my n*****'s who think they knew
If you know how I feel.
Never miss with an explosive yeah
(Back again, back again)
