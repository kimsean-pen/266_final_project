Baddest guy on circus sign
You are the space gun
Doesn't matter what you do
You know what you've done

Don't know you are too young

Drive them off from where they play
And see how they bleed
Blindly minding businesses
To show that you mean
To go where you go
Away
Far away
Where you run
You go where you go
And you know that you know
What you've done

Warming up and recognize
The fuse isn't long
Experimental exercise
But that's not so wrong

And making for taking
It all to the wire
A john (little john)
Phillip Sousa concert and choir

Here it comes

And you are Space Gun

All day long
