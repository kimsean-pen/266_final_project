I could use some time to curl away
My aggression is where you stake your claim
Why I question this curve on which you grade
My conception, a joke or latest craze?

I try to get away
and yet I stick around

So fall and crawl away
and brush away loose ground
My intention,

and I arrive at eight?
Lie and dream some

surprise you guys I'm late
All right, correction,

forgetting something, wait
I try to get away,
and yet I stick around
So fall and crawl away,
and brush away loose ground
I try to get away,
and yet I stick around
So fall and crawl away,
and brush away loose ground
Yeah brush away loose ground
Yeah brush away
