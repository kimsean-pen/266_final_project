Who goes there, it's the ghost of october
Summer is over, now I'm going nowhere
Who holds her, it's not me i'm a loner
But I don't wanna go, go, go there
You're sober, that's not me I'm a stoner
I prefer it when the world moves slower
Who goes there, it's just me I'm a soldier
I come from the snow, it's cold, cold, colder

It's baaaad, it's baaaaad
You don't know what I am, I'm a sick man
And this world feel so distant
But today I'm feeling so indiffrent
Every friday is Halloween
My week is a dream
I'm just working in my sleep
By any means I be low-key
I'm gonna need a reason to be seen
All the prayers for nothing :(
No touching, I find it discusting
Flying in my lane with my cousin
Why they buggin, I don't do discussion
I'm on an airplane to London
They want something from me all of a sudden
I'll come up when I'm summoned
I heard everything was gonna change but it wasn't

Who goes there, it's the ghost of october
Summer is over, now I'm going nowhere
Who holds her, it's not me i'm a loner
But I don't wanna go, go, go there
You're sober, that's not me I'm a stoner
I prefer it when the world moves slower
Who goes there, it's just me I'm a soldier
I come from the snow, it's cold, cold, colder
Who goes there, it's the ghost of october
Summer is over, now I'm going nowhere
Who holds her, it's not me i'm a loner
But I don't wanna go, go, go there
You're sober, that's not me I'm a stoner
I prefer it when the world moves slower
Who goes there, it's just me I'm a soldier
I come from the snow, it's cold, cold, colder
