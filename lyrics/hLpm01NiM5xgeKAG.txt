No time frame for what I need to do today
Here at the yellow house
I think that I'm gonna play
With some free livin' lads down the street aways away
As I feel the moon rise
The time that all feel is the right time
Here in our Sleepyhouse
As I wipe eye bugs away, the candle flickers at me to say
And in my head I sometimes pray
Hey, aren't you feeling fine
As I was as a little child
And I'm feeling better when I'm high
With a red light shining on, shining on a little unity
The mistakes that I've made, no they don't seem to bother me
And I sure as hell don't feel like I've missed any kind of train
If I could only show you how I feel, then you wouldn't bother me
And maybe then you'd see
You'd maybe see why we don't mind being blind
As I was a little child
And I'm feeling better when I'm high
With a red light shining on, shining on a little unity
I'll probably be in a little while
