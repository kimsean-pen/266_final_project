Hey kids, lets go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, lets go, let's go

Baby you stole my heart
I don't know what to do
Got one problem on my mind
Do you feel the way I do?
I want to know
Give me a sign girl
Open your heart and tell me that you're mine
I want to know
Give me a sign girl
Open your heart and tell me that you're mine

When you walk down the street, the cats don't even make a noise
They worship at your feet
Acting just like little boys
I'm standing in the shadows baby
I got one thing that's on my mind
Gonna make you love me baby if it takes the rest of my life
I want to know
Give me a sign girl
Open your heart and tell me that you're mine
I want to know
Give me a sign girl
Open your heart and tell me that you're mine

It takes a lot of guts to show you how I feel, well, about you
Just say the words and let me know that this is real for you
Or is it just a dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
I'm very patient baby and I've got a lot of time
I can see a clear horizon
You and me standing side by side
I want to know
Give me a sign girl
Open your heart and tell me that you're mine
I want to know
Give me a sign girl
Open your heart and tell me that you're mine
(I want know) I want to know
(I) Give me a sign girl
(You got to give, you got to have me, give, you gotta tell me) Open your heart and tell me that you're mine
I want to know (Please)
Give me a sign girl (Please)
Open your heart and tell me that you're mine (Open your heart and tell me that you're mine)

How're you feeling? Baby, baby, let me know

I want to know
I want to know

I want to know
I want to know
Give me a sign girl
Open your heart...
