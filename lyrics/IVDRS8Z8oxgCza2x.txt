I've been locked out
For twenty years or so
What is this sage on me now
If memories serve
Then I should forget not
This staring glass

My leg's so frail
Like I havent stood in years
This gate's so wrong
I crawl towards you
Familiar I was where
The name escapes me now

Fade and then return
Fade and then return

Like babies breath

I'm holding onto air
My lung's a theif
Should I know you
A stranger though you seem
You feel like home

Fade and then return
Fade and then return
Fade and then return (Fade and then return)
Fade and then return (Fade and then return)
(What comes around) Fade and then return
(What comes around) Fade and then return
(What comes around) Fade and then return
(What comes around)
