You don't wanna be rich like everybody else does
You just wanna grow old, sit still while everybody else runs
In the meantime, tell me your star sign
I'll make something up about how you have to fall apart to really be someone

There's nothing else to do here but kiss under the stars
I like you just the way you are
There's nothing else to do here but fall into your arms
I like you just the way you are

You're not like the others ones
You just wanna go slow, sit still and come undone
In the meantime, you wanna have some fun
Oh, you say you have to fall apart to really be someone

There's nothing else to do here but kiss under the stars
I like you just the way you are
There's nothing else to do here but fall into your arms
I like you just the way you are

Just the way you are
Just the way you are
Just the way you are
Just the way you are... I like you
Just the way you are
Just the way you are

There's nothing else to do here let's jump into your car
I like you just the way you are
There's nothing else to do here but fall into your arms
I like you just the way you are

Just the way you are... I like you
