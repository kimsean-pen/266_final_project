Hello Monday, goodbye bread
Bedtime Sunday, wash my head

Cos who plays the game we all play?
Won't you play me today?
And who sings the song when we're gone?
Won't you sing along?

Hello friend, goodbye blue
Hello me and goodbye to you
Hello

Cos who plays the game we all play?
Won't you play me today?
And who sings the song when we're gone?
Won't you sing along?

Hello Monday, goodbye bread.
