A cat came drifting
on my porch from the outside cold
and with eyes closed, drinking
warm milk from my bowl

thought:
"Nobody hears me, nobody hears me!
As I crept in so soft!
And nobody sees me, nobody sees me!"
...as I watch six steps off.

Like the peacocks wandering the walkways of the zoo
who have twice the autonomy the giraffes and tigers do

saying:
"No one can stop me, no one stop me!
No one clips my claws.
Now everyone watch me, everyone watch me
scale these outside walls."

Oh, you pious and profane,
put away your praise and blame.
A glass can only spill what it contains.
To the perpetually plain and the incurably inane:
A glass can only spill what it contains.

What new mystery is this?
What blessed backwardness?
The Immeasurable one is held and does not resist!
Struck by wicked words and foolish fists of senseless men
the Almighty One does not defend!

I'm halfway listening to what she thinks she knows.
We're like children dressing in our parents clothes

saying:
"Nobody knows me, nobody knows me.
No one knows my name!
Nobody knows me, nobody knows me.
Nobody knows me..."

I half-heartedly explained,
but gave up peacefully ashamed.
A glass can only spill what it contains.
We went through Portugal and Spain,
and in her mind the entire time it rained!
A glass can only spill what it contains.

What new mystery is this?
In overflowing emptiness
the invisible is seen among the shadows and the mist.
Before my doubting eyes,
The infinite appears and sighs.
The unquestionable is questioned
but makes no reply!

What new mystery is this? [x5]
My rabbi, my lips betray with a kiss!
What new mystery is this?
