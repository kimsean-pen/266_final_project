When I walk up to your door
When I walk into your room
And open windows

Can you hold it in your hand
Can you make me understand
The tension, the pressure

And I know just what it means
To be left out all alone
I got it just like that

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
I wanna go, go, go, go right back again
I wanna give, give, give, give you everything
I wanna go, go, go, go right back again
I wanna give, give, give, give you everything
I wanna go

Troubled eyes, equipment of my heart
An all the time reflecting on why heart
Funny how the game got all twisted
Like day and night, never existed

Could I be more true to life
Tell me how did I become
Half my real self

Wanna reach and touch the skies
Wanna end the lonely nights
The breathless hours

And I know just what it means
To be left out all alone
I got it just like that

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
I wanna go, go, go, go right back again
I wanna give, give, give, give you everything
I wanna go, go, go, go right back again
I wanna give, give, give, give you everything
I wanna go
