I can see myself in a broken reflection
This magnifies my imperfection
Beaten down, and I'm crawling, I'm craving affection
A fade out projection
Comfort in violence, suffer in silence
Lost in self deception
Is there no salvation?

Brick by brick I've built this wall
I shut you out to break the fall
I will shed my sins
I'll show you my skeletons
One by one we cast the stones
Flesh and blood, and broken bones
Burn away the sins
We all have our skeletons

We all have our skeletons

I have lost myself in my addictions
There's no faith in fear or self-destruction
Falling out, falling down
And I'm crawling to you to confess my intentions
Suffer the violence, comfort in silence
Lost in self deception
Is there no salvation?

Brick by brick I've built this wall
I shut you out to break the fall
I will shed my sins
I'll show you my skeletons
One by one we cast the stones
Flesh and blood, and broken bones
Burn away the sins
We all have our skeletons

Brick by brick!

Skeletons!

Brick by brick I've built this wall
I shut you out to break the fall
I will shed my sins
I'll show you my skeletons
One by one we cast the stones
Flesh and blood, and broken bones
Burn away the sins
We all have our skeletons
