I don't wanna feel your skin, I don't deserve your taste
Oh and I can't wait to stay inside and feel my body waste away
The ceilings falling and my eyes cave in Nobody's
listening and I can't tell my blood from the nitroglycerin
I find it sobering to be defiled so easily
I know I should feel pain, but it's eluding me
If you'd stop for a moment to watch my skin peel out
Then I promise you will get your wish You're gonna see me open up
But all the wires and the circuits
could entangle us in a fabricated love
I don't have the will to love you anymore
This selfish solemn vow I swore takes hold
Why do you say that you care when you aren't listening?
Why aren't you listening?
I know, it's all, for show
This skin, these muscles and the way they grow
I find it sobering to be defiled so easily There
is a part of me that crystallized inside of your gaze
I don't wanna feel your skin I don't deserve your taste
My eyes, they fixate on the sky and it's electric grace
And it changes me
But this is written inside of my genetic code
I can't erase the segments that have made me cold
They've made me cold
