Everybody's got somethin' to say
But they ain't never shown me nothing
They all waste their time just stuntin' on me
Ain't nobody gonna get in my way
See, I ain't got to cheat the system
I'm all good, I found my rhythm
So don't waste time tryna tell me
What you think I want to hear
Talk is cheap
You got to show me it's real
'Cause I ain't got time to waste, no
I don't sleep
I think you know what the deal is
So don't you feed that stuff to me
Talk is cheap
Said ain't it funny how you get on my case?
Pushing me beyond my limits
Talking about numbers and digits
Take your money and get outta my face
I'm focused, I got my vision
Go find someone tryna listen
So don't you waste time tryna tell me
What you think I want to hear, oh, baby
Talk is cheap
Talk is cheap, got to show me it's real
'Cause I ain't got time to waste
No, I don't sleep
I think you know what the deal is
So don't you feed that stuff to me
Talk is cheap
Don't you know that talk is cheap?
So don't you waste your time on me
I don't roll with wannabes
Don't you know that talk is cheap?
