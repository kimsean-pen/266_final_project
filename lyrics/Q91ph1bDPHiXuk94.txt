Haven't laughed this hard in a long time
Better stop now before I start crying.
Go off to sleep in the sunshine
Don't want to see the day when it's dying.

She's a sight to see, she's good to me
I'm already somebody's baby.
She's a pretty thing and she knows everything
But I'm already somebody's baby.

You don't deserve to be lonely
But those drugs you got won't make you feel better.
Pretty soon you'll find it's the only
Little part of your life you're keeping together.

I'd be nice to you, if I could make it through
But you're already somebody's baby.
I could make you smile if you stayed a while
But how long will you stay with me baby?

Because your candle burns too bright
I almost forgot it was twilight.
Even if I think that you are right
Well, I'm tired of being down, I got no fight.

You're wonderful, and it's beautiful
But I'm already somebody's baby.
And if I went with you I'd disappoint you too.
I'm already somebody's baby.
Already somebody's baby.
