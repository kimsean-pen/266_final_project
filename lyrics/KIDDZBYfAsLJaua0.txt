Maybe this time, I'll be lucky
Maybe this time, he'll stay
Maybe this time
For the first time
Love won't hurry away

He will hold me fast
I'll be home at last
Not a loser anymore
Like the last time
And the time before

Everybody loves a winner
So nobody loved me
Lady Peaceful, Lady Happy
That's what I long to be

Well all the odds are there in my favor
Something's bound to begin
It's got to happen, happen sometime
Maybe this time I'll win

'Cause everybody, oh, they'd love a winner
So nobody loved me
Lady Peaceful, Lady Happy
That's what I long to be

Well all the odds are there in my favor
Something's bound to begin
It's got to happen, happen sometime
Maybe this time, maybe this time I'll win
