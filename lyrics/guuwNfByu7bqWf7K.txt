Time on my hands
Since you've been away boy
I ain't got no plans (no, no, no, no)
and the sound of the rain against my window pane
Is slowly, is slowly driving me insane, boy

Chorus:

I'm goin' down
I'm goin down
Cause you ain't around baby
My whole world's upside down

Sleep don't come easy
Boy please believe me
Since you've been gone
Everything's goin wrong
Why'd you have to say goodbye
Look what you've done to me
I can't stop these tears from falling from my eyes, ooh baby

Chorus(repeat)

Oooh Baby love ya
Goin' down
Goin' Down
Hmmmm
Hmmm, Goin' down
Oooh, I

Chorus(repeat)

I don't know what to do
If I ever loose you
I'll be goin' down
I said I'll be goin' down
Oooh
Please forgive me baby
I'm so sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
What did I do wrong?
I said
What did I do wrong?
Please forgive my baby
And come on home
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
