Springing like a chicken
I wake up in the morning
Cooking me my bacon and bread
Jumping in the shower
In less than half an hour
To make it to the congregation

I'm going, let's shake it down the aisle
Breaking bread with my own flesh in sky
I've got the spirit of God
I've got the spirit of God

Now the preacher going crazy
He swears he's gonna save me
Knocking pebbles out on the floor
My soul stops jumping
I know I'm feeling something
While I'm giving it up to the Lord

We're going, let's shake it down the aisle
Different mother, brother, sister and child
Got the spirit of God
We got the spirit of God

And make it like a slow celebration
Just set your situation right
I know I'm gonna head straight to heaven
Destination straight to the light
I'm going on the highway to heaven
I know. I've got the spirit of God
I've got the spirit of God

My moves already working
I'm broken but I'm burning
Get myself back up on the street
People call me lazy
Yea just a little maybe
Driving everyone that I meet

But I'm going, let's shake it down the aisle
Yea I'll do it with my own flashy style
I've got the spirit of God
I've got the spirit of God

And make it like a slow celebration
Just set your situation right
I know I'm gonna head straight to heaven
Destination straight to the light
I'm going on the highway to heaven
I know. I've got the spirit of God
Got me the spirit of God

Alright, alright now, show em how to do it
I couldn't, I couldn't
That's alright

I've got the spirit of God, I want to thank you Lord
I've got the spirit of God for giving me the word
I've got the spirit of God, I want to thank you Lord
I want to thank you Lord, I've got to thank you Lord
I've got the spirit of God, I want to thank the one
I've got the spirit of God, you take his only son
I've got the spirit of God, I want to thank you Lord
I want to thank you Lord

I'm going on the highway to heaven
Destination straight to the light
I'm going on the highway to heaven
Destination straight to the light
I'm going on the highway to heaven
I've got the spirit of God
I've got the spirit of God
Yea I've got the spirit of God
You gave me the spirit of God
