Working for nothing, your new life awaits
If you can pay you'll get in
Sold into slavery, you were promised a better life
Your family waits at home, you struggle by yourself

Trapped in a foreign world, where do you get help?
Can't trust the government, they just want to kick you out
Living in fear that one day they'll find you
Freedom enslaved
