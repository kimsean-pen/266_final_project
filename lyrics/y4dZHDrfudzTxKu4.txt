Do you acknowledge what I'm saying?
Do you acknowledge what I'm saying?
I love him more, don't think that I forgot
I love him more, no he won't be forgot

Do you acknowledge what I'm saying?
Do you acknowledge what I'm saying?
I love him more, I wish I could protect
I love him more, nobody could protect

Don't ignore the feeling, you're in the right
Secrets of the cops are covering up the reasons
Oh I believe it, and I haven't seen it

Well I love him more

Don't ignore the feeling, you're in the right
Oh I believe it, and I haven't seen it
Oh I believe it, and I haven't seen it

I love him more, don't think that I forgot
Well I love him more, our sons we won't forget
