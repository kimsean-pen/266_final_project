When the lady smiles, you know it drives me wild
Her lips are warm and resourceful
When her fingertips, go drawing circles in the night
And the mood is soft and sensual, hu-u
And I love it, yeah I love it
It's the answer to all my dreams

Everytime it feels like the earth is shakin'
It doesn't matter, a glass is fallin', I hear it shatter
Maybe it's raining, faster and faster
Shadow dancin', together oh I
I'm a bettin' on the game of love
oh oh oh I, I'm bettin' that love is gonna come out
When the walls no longer shout, back at me
and I'm feelin' proud

When the lady smiles, she holds me in her hand
As a matter of fact, she could always let me down
But when the lady smiles, I can't resist her call
As a matter of fact, I don't resist at all
'cos I'm walking on clouds and she is leadin' the way

My friends tell me, she's the beast inside your paradise
I guess you've heard it all before
A fallen angel, that has got you hypnotised
and that always needs some more, hu-u
and I love it, yeah I love it
She's done nothin' to mislead me
'cos everytime we meet the earth is shakin'
It doesn't matter, a glass is fallin', I hear it shatter
Maybe it's rainin', faster and faster
Shadow dancin', together oh I
I'm bettin' on the game of love
Oh oh oh I, I'm bettin' that love is gonna come out
When the walls no longer shout, back at me
and I'm feeling proud
When the lady smiles, she holds me in her hand
As a matter of fact, she could always let me down
But when the lady smiles, I can't resist her call
As a matter of fact, I don't resist at all
'cos we're walkin' on clouds and she is leadin'
Oh no, oh no, oh nooooo...
