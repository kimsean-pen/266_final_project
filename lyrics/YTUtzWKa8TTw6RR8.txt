Evidence, resistance, apathy, perdition
Evidence, resistance, apathy, perdition

I come forth with a vengeance, escaping my death sentence
True rebel, and I care not if I offend you with my presence
Seeker of my own path, inventor of my own math
Those wanting to destroy me will die slowly in a bloodbath

Willing to battle the serpent that rattles
Beware what he preaches, your brains he will scrabble
War on the spirit, the mind and the soul
I'll die a free man that nothing controls
Down with all tyrants, I stand in defiance
Anarchy, chaos, in sighting a riot
There ain't no solution, I come to a conclusion
Fight for my rights, fuck all the bullshit

Evidence, resistance, apathy, perdition
Evidence, resistance

Here I stand, wounded but not broken
The gods hear my prayers even before I even spoke them
The journey must continue, I fight on like a Hessian
Forgiving those who hate me and thankful for my blessings
Mindful of the fact that tomorrow's not a given
I bow to carry on, and to stay ambition driven
Cloaked in solid armor, sword and shield protect me
I stand by my world, you can take me or reject me

Evidence, resistance, apathy, perdition
Evidence, resistance, apathy, perdition

Although outnumbered, I'm kicking and punching and still full of fight
You try to pull me under, I'm choking and taking and snuffing out life
Earth is a struggle, you take on the challenge no matter the strife
I speak of the priceless, there's nothing more special than your fucking life

Willing to battle the serpent that rattles
Beware what he preaches, your brains he will scrabble
War on the spirit, the mind and the soul
I'll die a free man that nothing controls
Down with all tyrants, I stand in defiance
Anarchy, chaos, in sighting a riot
There ain't no solution, I come to a conclusion
Fight for my rights, fuck all the bullshit
