What she said she said to me
Take me high on a mountain side
She was dressed up in leopard skin
And her soul would never be denied

I met her down the disco in a beat up car
She was burning down the road

She looked just like a star with a jaguar
She needs to lighten her load

And when you might
Think you're gonna cry
It will be all right
Step out tonight
You might
Think you're gonna cry
It will be all right
Step out tonight

What I said I said to her
I'm alive when you walk that way
Can you hear what I can hear?
It's the sound of a brand new day
She met me down a disco in a beat up car
I was burning down the road
I can be a star in a jaguar
I need to lighten my load

Because you might
Think you're gonna cry
It will be all right
Step out tonight
You might
Think you're gonna cry
It will be all right
Step out tonight

My whole life still sinking in the water
I need a ship not your sweet lip tonight

You might
Think you're gonna cry
It will be all right
Step out tonight
You might
Think you're gonna cry
It will be all right
Step out tonight
And if you might
Think you're gonna cry
It will be all right
Step out tonight
And when you might
Think you're gonna cry
It will be all right
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Step out tonight
Tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight tonight
