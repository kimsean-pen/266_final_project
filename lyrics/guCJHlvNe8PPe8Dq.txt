Here we are in the maelstrom of love
Waiting for the call to sooth our hearts
Here we are and don't know how to stop
Waiting for the war to end it all

Love is insane and baby
We are too
It's our hearts little grave
And the salt in our wounds

Love is insane and baby
So we too, yeah
It's our hearts little grave
And the salt in our wounds

Here we are right back where we began
Waiting for sweet love with open arms
Here we are just like before
Waiting for the wounds of that tender storm

Love is insane and baby
We are too
It's our hearts little grave
And the salt in our wounds

Love is insane and baby
So we too, yeah
It's our hearts little grave
And the salt in our wounds

Love is insane and baby
We are too
It's our hearts little grave
And the salt in our wounds

Love is insane and baby
So we too, yeah
It's our hearts little grave
And the salt in our wounds

Love is insane and baby
We are too
It's our hearts little grave
And the salt in our wounds

Love is insane and baby
So we too, yeah
It's our hearts little grave
And the salt in our wounds

The salt in our wounds
The salt in our wounds.
