No matter where you're going
No matter where you be
Wherever the wind is blowing
Let me be your gravity

I can be your hero
I can be your fantasy
I can be the cure
Yeah
Let me be
Your remedy

Right beside you
I'll never leave you

Let me be your heart and your company
I'll let you be the one who can lean on me
I'll catch you when you fall
When you're falling free
Let me be, be your gravity

Let me be your wings
When you're flying high
I'm gonna raise you up till you touch the sky
I'll catch you when you fall
When you're falling free
Let me be, be your gravity

Touch me, inseparably
Like gravity

As high as the highest mountain
As low as the deepest sea
Oh settle down just let me be your gravity

Let me be your heart and your company
I'll let you be the one who can lean on me
I'll catch you when you fall
When you're falling free
Let me be, be your gravity

Let me be your wings
When you're flying high
I'm gonna raise you up till you touch the sky
I'll catch you when you fall
When you're falling free
Let me be, be your gravity

Touch inseparably
It's all we'll ever be
You be gravity

Let me be your heart and your company
I'll let you be the one who can lean on me
I'll catch you when you fall
When you're falling free
Let me be, be your gravity

Let me be your wings
When you're flying high
I'm gonna raise you up till you touch the sky
I'll catch you when you fall
When you're falling free
Let me be, be your gravity

I'll catch you when you fall
When you're falling free
Let me be, be your gravity
