Oh, I'm always looking for signs
Reading between the lines
I'm always looking for a guarantee
I'm always looking for a guarantee

Does anybody feel it too
Cause right now I don't have a clue
Can sombody help me out
Show me what it's all about

I don't know how I got there
I don't know why I'm still here
I don't know how I got there

All under the same spell
Throwing pennies in the wishing well
Kneel down and kiss the ring
Mum and Dad it don't mean a thing

I don't know how I got there
I don't know why I'm still here
I don't know how I got there

I'm always looking for a sign
That things might pick up down the line
Move forward
Look back
At the same time
