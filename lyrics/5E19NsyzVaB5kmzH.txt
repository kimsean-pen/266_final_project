The pouring rain
Sticks my hair to my face
An empty gaze is all I have left
The stars that once lit my way have dimmed

The sky turned grey
The path once so clear
Faded away
Blessed are the days when life is intent and clear

No falter or doubt
I know the way
They are the days, I hoped
I have never stepped from this road
The spark I once had
Seems to have died

Stand Up and Fight
Stand Up and Look Into The Light
Pushing the clouds away...
Stand Up and Fight

Stand Up and See The Sky Turn Bright
Fight for a better day...
What a relief it would be to end this all
How easy to fly the white flag and give up
But would I run today just to die another day
Give up now and every fight has been in vain

Stand Up and Fight
Stand Up and Look Into The Light
Pushing the clouds away...
Stand Up and Fight

Stand Up and See The Sky Turn Bright

Fight for a better day...
GET UP
YOU'VE MADE IT THIS FAR
NO LOSER YOU ARE
ONE MORE TIME
ONE MORE TRY

The pouring rain
Sticks my hair to my face
Stand Up and Fight
Stand Up and Look Into The Light
Pushing the clouds away...
Stand Up and Fight
Stand Up and See The Sky Turn Bright
Fight for a better day...
STAND UP AND FIGHT!
FIGHT FIGHT
STAND UP AND FIGHT
