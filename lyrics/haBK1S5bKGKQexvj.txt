I'll fake it through the day with some help
From johnny walker red, and the cold pain behind my eyes
That shoots back through my head,
With two tickets torn in half in a lot with nothing to do,
But its alright cause some enchanted night i'll be with you.

Tarot cards and the lines in my hand
Tell me i'm wrong but they're untrue.

I got plans for both of us that involve a trip out of town
To a place i've seen in a magazine that you left lying around,
I can't hold my liquor but I keep a good attitude
Cause its alright some enchanted night i'll be with you.

And though you'd rather see me gone then to see that
Come the day, ill be waiting for you anyway.

Next on the tv flashing blue frames on the wall,
Its a comedy from the seventies with a lead no one recalls.
He vanished into oblivion its easy to do,
And I cried a sea when you talked to me
The day you said we were through
But its alright, some enchanted night i'll be with you
