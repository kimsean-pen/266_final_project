She is the fractured one sewn
From sums of fractured time
Her heart speaks a fractured tongue
Her life is fractured design
She shares the weight of the sun
A love that burns alone
Leaving their hearts with no one
Claiming no other their own

Babelonia
It's a wonder
You can believe
In what you see
Babelonia
Divided love
Childhood history
Adult's mystery

She is her prophet and god
She is the comfort she seeks
She is a thousand wires sewn
Through the outcome she receives
They share the cloak of the moon
Under the darkened sky
They leave their secrets to roam
In the forgiveness of night

Babelonia
It's a wonder
You can believe
In what you see
Babelonia
Divided love
