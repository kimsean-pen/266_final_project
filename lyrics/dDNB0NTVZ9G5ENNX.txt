I used to tell people, like, "I'ma have this, I'ma have that..."
"...I'ma get this, I'ma get a car and be famous before you..."
"...I'ma be rich before you"
My sister thought she was gonna be
rich before me, even though she ain't
They thought I was gon' be some motherfuckin' screw-up or something
They thought I was gonna be, like, bad all my life
They thought she was gonna be a
lawyer before I'll be a rapper, or something
She crazy
(How old's your sister?)
She thirteen now
The little kid's crazyâ€”all little kids crazy
A lawyer...
It be like, if you win, you a winner
Know what I'm sayin'?
This year I started off
Yep, right
I ain't got a job now, and I got a daughter too, so...
Gotta make it happen

(This a LeekeLeek banger!) Sosa, baby
GBE, baby
Y'know we rockin', baby
And you know what it do, baby

Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'

Bad bitches keep callin'
I swear this money keep fallin'
I'm best friends with Ben, shawty
I don't even wanna start in
'Cause I'm ballin'
Bitch, I'm ballin'

Rollin' up this dope
Pop a nigga somethin' like Crisco
All I do is spend dough
I don't even know this bitch no mo'
'Cause I'm ballin'
So please, bitch, stop callin'

Bitch, I'm Chief Keef
Every bitch know me
If the bitch don't know me
Let me tell you hoes 'bout me
Bitch, I'm ballin'
And we shoot, no talkin'

Rockin' in my pink dolphin
Finna pop me a blue dolphin
Broke-ass niggas who talkin'
If you ain't talkin' money, then you thru talkin'
Bitch, I'm ballin'
On these broke niggas, I'm ballin'
Ballin', ballin'

Bad bitches keep callin'
I swear this money keep fallin'
I'm best friends with Ben, shawty
I don't even wanna start in
'Cause I'm ballin'
Bitch, I'm ballin'

Sippin' on that lean
I go hard for my team
Pockets filled with that green
I just blow it all on my team
'Cause I'm ballin'
Nigga, I'm ballin'

Ride around wit my 3Hunnas
All my niggas, we stuntin'
Spendin' commas, bitch, it's nothin'
And I'm eatin', got me a big stomach
'Cause I'm ballin'
I'm ballin', I'm ballin'

I be countin' them stacks
Crackin' cards, get back
I gets me a big check
And everything designer but it's mismatch
'Cause I'm ballin'
I'm ballin' like Spalding

True's off my ass
Pockets filled with that cash
Niggas see me, they mad
Bitches see me, they pants I'm in fallin'
Now I'm through talkin'
'Cause I'm ballin', I'm ballin'

Bad bitches keep callin'
I swear this money keep fallin'
I'm best friends with Ben Shawty
I don't even want you "darling"
'Cause I'm ballin'
Bitch, I'm ballin'

Sippin' on that lean
I go hard for my team
Pockets filled with that green
I just blow it all on my team
'Cause I'm ballin'
Nigga, I'm ballin'
