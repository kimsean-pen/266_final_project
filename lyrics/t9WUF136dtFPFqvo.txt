Listen to the world out on the outside pressing in,
are you ready on my mark?
Fingers given names and with the last word they ascend
on the comfort of their well being in arms
into something they can't stop but wish that they could kill.
You're the answer to their prayers.

In your last hour stand,
you'll notice
the one that you have loved in dreams is here among the others,
Chase it's you I want.
But if I can't have her,
then why should I spend any more
time in a world that's going to end pretty soon?
I need you now more than I ever did,
I'll hand myself over for you.
This commlink's lost its frequency
and I feel that we're coming home short, oh.
Here take me instead, I'd rather not see her off alone.

Scattered amongst the killing streets the children slate defense,
is God's work to have us fail?
Rivered blood shoots out the dead as bodies foul the air,
I'll make peace when this done.
In arms we storm,
slowly the streets begin to fill with new flesh bound to bone.
Armed and ready it begins again

In your last hour stand,
you'll notice
the one that you had loved in dreams is here among the others,
Chase it's you I want.
But if I can't have her,
then why should I spend any more
time in a world that's going to end pretty soon?
I need you now more than I ever did,
I'll hand myself over for you.
This commlink's lost its frequency
and I feel that we're coming home short, oh.
Here take me instead, I'd rather not see her off alone.

Tonight we storm.
Tonight...

Hahaha!

Deliver a favor to my love. (4x)
