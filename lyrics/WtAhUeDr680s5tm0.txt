Feel my heart
Skip along the odd days
I got 1600 lies
Now I'll mind my own

In your youth
You think about the exit days
I swear that I'll be there
But I won't cry for long, shut up

Drift along the narrow way
She don't want you anymore
Now you are alone

Every single night the owls will get older
Keepin' me awake, the hours go longer

Taste the skin
Your father can remember
The day you walked alone
You screamed at the floor, shut up

Drift along the narrow way
She don't want you anymore
Now you are alone

Drift along the narrow way
I got 1600 miles
I wanna go home, yeah

And I'll keep it in my arms
And I'll hold on it real light
The only time you cried you thought it was done

Drift along the narrow way
She don't want you anymore
Now you are alone

Now you are alone
Now you are alone
Now you are alone
Now you are alone

Now you are alone
Now you are alone
Now you are alone
Now you are alone

Now you are alone
Now you are alone
Now you are alone
Now you are alone

Now you are alone
Now you are alone
Now you are alone
