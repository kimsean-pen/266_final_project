So I ran faster
But it caught me here
Yes, my loyalties turned
Like my ankle
In the seventh grade
Running after Billy
Running after the rain

These precious things
Let them bleed, let them wash away
These, I said precious things
Let them break their hold over me

I, I, I, I said I go
He said, he
You go and I said, I said, I said I go with you

He said, you're really an ugly girl
But I like the way you play
And I died
But I thanked him
Can you believe that?
Sick, sick
Holding on to his picture
Dressing up every day
I want to smash the faces
Of those beautiful boys
Those Christian boys

Beautiful boys
I said, Christian boys
Beautiful boys
So you can make me come
That doesn't make you Jesus

These precious things
Let them bleed now, wash away
These I said precious things
Let them break their hold over me

I, I, I said
In and I said, you go and I, you

I remember, yes
In my peach party dress
No one dared
No one cared to tell me
Where the pretty girls are
Those demigods
With their nine inch nails
And little fascist panties
Tucked inside the heart of every nice girl

These are my, are in my life, I said
Bleed now, bleed now
These in my heart and
You in my head and
Bleed now, just bleed now
You in my heart and these in my head
And bleed now, bleed

I said these, oh precious things
Let them bleed, yes
Wash these things, daddy
Wash away these things
These are my precious things
Let them bleed, yes
Wash these things, daddy
Wash away these things

These are my precious things
Let them bleed now, girls just bleed
These are my precious things
Let them break, break their hold over me
I, I, I, I said, I said, I said
I can't let you, let you go, yes
Precious
Precious
