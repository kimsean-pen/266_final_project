No no no
You don't love me
And I know now

No no no
You don't love me
Yes I know now

'Cause you left me
Baby
And I got no place to go now

No no no
I'll do anything you say boy

No no no
I'll do anything you say boy

'Cause if you asked me
Baby
I'll get on my knees and pray boy

No no no
You don't love me
And I know now

No no no
You don't love me
Yes I know now
