Imagine a sunny holiday
Paris or cafe
Corner table for two
And that is me and you

Barefoot by the shore
A drink with ice and two straws
Sigh up at clouded sky
You wave as the girls go by

Take a boat out for a while
You row and I lay back in style
We'll reach the other side you say
But we never get half way

When the evening comes around
We stroll through a lamp lit little town
Miles and miles from home
Happy to be on our own

Nothing I would rather do
All I want is a place in the sun and you
Nothing I would rather do
All I want is a place in the sun and you
