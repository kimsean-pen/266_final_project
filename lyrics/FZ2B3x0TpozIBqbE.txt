Yesterday I spotted you
Hangin' out with someone new
Come on dude I can't believe who
Did it hurt oh yes it hurt
But not as much as I thought it would
Guess it's time for me to move on

I'm getting closer (closer)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)
Everyday's closer (closer)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)

I finally took your pictures down
And all that other stuff I found
Hidden somewhere in my closet
I used to wear your shirt to bed
But now it's in the trash instead
I don't wanna be reminded
No no

I'm getting closer (closer)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)
Everyday's closer (closer)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)

I saw you today taken my breath away
But then you opened your mouth
Without thinking
And then I recalled why I ended it all
And it makes me feel good about leaving
Leaving

Oh
Everyday everyday everyday everyday
Everyday everyday everyday everyday

I'm getting closer (closer)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)
Everyday's closer (closer)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)

[Backwords]
Oh
Closer to closure
Closer
Closer to closure
