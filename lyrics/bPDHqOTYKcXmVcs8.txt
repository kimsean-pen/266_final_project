We mouthed the words to all of the saddest songs
Because they felt like home
And I watched you out of the corner of my eye
And that smile you gave me launched one thousand beats of my heart.
So you can lean a little harder I will take that weight from you
I will be that call in the middle of the night the picture kept in your favorite book
And it you just want someone to call yours I will be that tool
I was just looking for someone to leave me breathless and i found it in you...
And I don't want to miss you anymore
So here is one song to call your own to kiss away the tears and leave no traces of pain
So angelic and comforting these are my dreams
All comming true and I must have played that message one thousand times
Just to hear your voice before I went to sleep.
