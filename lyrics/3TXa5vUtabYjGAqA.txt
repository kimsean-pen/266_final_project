I'm gonna be a rock and roll star
Gonna groove from night to day
Gonna blow my honey jar
Gonna blow my blues away

I'm gonna make a stand
Gonna make a million
Gonna make it with you
I'm gonna be right my friend
I'm gonna push it through

It's Electric, It's Electric
It's Electric, It's Electric

I stop on red but I leave on amber
Danger paves my way
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna make it today

Gonna get this dust from my heels
Down the Highway I go---whoa
Gonna get the stars from my route
Make it in a rock and roll show---whoa whoa

It's Electric, It's Electric
It's Electric, It's Electric

I stop on red but I leave on amber
And you face my way
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna make it today

Gonna get the dust from my heels
Down the Highway I go---whoa
Gonna get the stars from my route
Make it in a rock and roll show

It's Electric, It's Electric
It's Electric, It's Electric
It's Electric, It's Electric
It's Electric, It's Electric
