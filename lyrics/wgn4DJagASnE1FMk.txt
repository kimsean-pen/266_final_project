I keep on running but I can't get to the mountain
Behind me lie the years that I've misspent
And I've been sinking like a flower in the fountain
When all the love I'm gonna need is heaven sent

Gonna try my best to get there
But I can't afford the bus fare
And the storm that's rolling over
Man, it makes me want to cry

And I was told
That the streets were paved with gold
And there'd be no time for getting old when we were young
But it's alright
If you dance with me tonight
We'll fight the dying of the light and we'll catch the sun

I woke up sleeping on a train that was bound for nowhere
The echoes that I could hear were all my own
The world had turned and I'd become a stranger
And I'm tired of watching all the flowers turn to stone

'Cause I try my best to get there
But I can't afford the bus fare
And the storm that's rolling over
Man, it makes me want to cry

And the cold against my shoulder
When it comes on in the winter
And it seems to last forever
And it makes me want to,
It makes me want to cry

And I was told
That the streets were paved with gold
And there'd be no time for getting old when we were young
But it's alright
If you dance with me tonight
We'll fight the dying of the light and we'll catch the sun

'Cause I try my best to get there
But I can't afford the bus fare
And the storm that's rolling over
Man, it makes me want to cry

And I was told
That the streets were paved with gold
And there'd be no time for getting old when we were young
But it's alright
If you dance with me tonight
We'll fight the dying of the light and we'll catch the sun

And the cold against my shoulder
When it comes on in the winter
And it makes me want to cry

And the cold against my shoulder
And it seems to last forever
And it makes me want to,
It makes me want to cry
