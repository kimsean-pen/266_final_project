Come to see nights of pleasure (ooh oh-oh-oh)
Do it now or you may never
Come to see nights of pleasure (ooh oh-oh-oh)
Do it now or you may never

Did you ever think that you could take the strain
That you'd need a change to shake the blues away
Can you understand exactly how I feel
Just leave it all behind pretend that it's not real
It's your place in time to relax your mind
And find out in life there's more
There's a place in time that is yours or mine
And the stars shine forever more

Come to see nights of pleasure (Come to see)
Do it now, or you may never (Or you will never ooh)
Come to see nights of pleasure (Come to see)
Do it now or you may never (Ooh-oh)

Laying on a hill on a calm cool night
Staring at the moon shining oh so bright
Being with the one that understands your dreams
This is what you need girl to make your life complete now
It's your place in time to enjoy the kind
Of life, you deserve and more
Time to leave behind what you could not find
Then your nights will seem much more umm yeah

Come to see nights of pleasure (Just relax your mind)
Do it now or you may never (Come to see, ooh-wee)
Come to see nights of pleasure (I wanna be the one relaxing you)
Do it now or you may never (Just relax your mind ooh-wee, ooh-o)

Come to see nights of pleasure (We'll talk all night, mmm)
Do it now or you may never (You may never)
Come to see nights of pleasure (We'll be staring at the moon soon)
Do it now or you may never (And let the stars shine)
Come to see nights of pleasure (Laying on the hill, now mmm)
Do it now or you may never
We're gonna shake the blues away
(Until the night turns into day) Come to see nights of pleasure
(Weeks of pleasure) Do it now or you may never
