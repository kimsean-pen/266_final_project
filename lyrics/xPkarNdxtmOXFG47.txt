What is it that I think I need?
Is there love in me that wants to be freed?
Or is it selfishness and ego
we carry with us everywhere that we go?

This feeling that life's incomplete
do you feel that too?
Do you want what I want?

And if I should start to cry,
and I can't begin to tell you why,
and I stumble when I begin,
it's cause I don't understand anything.

People say that we're so close,
how can there be something that I don't know.
Oh but even though I share your bed,
baby, I don't get inside your head.

This feeling of some mystery
do you feel that too?
Do you know what I mean?

And if I should start to cry,
and I can't begin to tell you why,
and I stumble when I begin,
it's cause I don't understand anything.

Watch me stumble, watch me slip
My fingers loose their grip.
Now I'm down on my knees,
Is that what you wanted to see?

What is it that I think I need?
What is it that I think I need?

And if I should start to cry,
and I can't begin to tell you why,
and I stumble when I begin,
it's cause I don't understand anything.

You reach for me from miles away,
you reach for me from miles away.
