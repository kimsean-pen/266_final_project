Give me the strength to break
Through and not fade away
It's not something you say
That makes you feel safe
Stop pretending

Reset it's easy to let go
It's always hard to silence the echo
Admit this is reality
It's telling you that you're living a fallacy

Beware it defies your design
Our fears will be internalized
Your presence shapes this world
And defines our hope

These impurities take a hold of me
Refuse to concede
I need to seek clarity

I'm living on my own
These securities
The forces in my head
Keep me wondering what's next

I'm living on my own
These securities
The forces in my head
Keep me wondering what's next

Tasteless, careless thoughts
They overwhelm my heart
Convinced that I am whole
I will not dissolve
I will not dissolve

Give me the strength to break
Through and not fade away
It's not something you say
That makes you feel safe
Stop pretending

Reset it's easy to let go
It's always hard to silence the echo
Admit this is reality
It's telling you that you're living a fallacy

Beware it defies your design
Our fears will be internalized
Your presence shapes this world
And defines our hope

These impurities take a hold of me
Refuse to concede
I need to seek clarity

I'm living on my own
These securities
The forces in my head
Keep me wondering what's next

I'm living on my own
These securities
The forces in my head
Keep me wondering what's next
