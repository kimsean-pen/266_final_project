Say it first
Don't just say it, don't just say it back to me
I need words, use your words to love me actively
Act as if you're actually attracted to me
Say it first, baby girl, say it first

Oh every time the sun sets
And the clouds turn purple by the waterfront
I want to be closer to you
What's a boy in love supposed to be doing now?
Well how do you love me? Let me count the ways
Counting up the days since I told you
That I want to be close, to be closer to you
What's a boy in love supposed, supposed to be doing
When you won't say it first?

Don't just say it, don't just say it back to me
I need words, use your words to love me actively
Act as if you're actually attracted to me
Say it first, baby girl, say it first

Baby, I'm a black hole
We can't stop fighting now 'cause you're a punk
But I love to lock antlers with you
Stare me down, frown, well I don't answer to you
Loving you requires ammunition
Well can you listen or are you deaf?
'Cause I love to speak sweetly to you
And tell you how it feels to be completely for you
But you still won't say it first

Oh it's not my fault
The stupid phrase never stays in my mouth
I smuggle you hugs while you're working
But I'm hurting, 'cause you won't say it first

Don't just say it, don't just say it back to me
'Cause I need words, use your words to love me actively
Act as if you're actually trying to smash with me
Say it first, baby girl, say it first
