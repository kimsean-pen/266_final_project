Fuck that shit, you know
Yeah, yeah, you know what I'm saying
Fuck you, you right though
We just tired of seeing these peon-ass niggas man
So we point these niggas out, huh
Point that little nigga out, uh
Point that nigga out, huh
Point that little nigga out, ooh
Give a fuck 'bout what you sayin'
Heard you running your mouth
When I see 'em I'ma Pacquiao 'em
Diamonds shining with the lights out
And I'm heavyweight
Winning like every bout
I'ma wrap shit like calamari
I'ma punch your belly in a bout
Point that nigga out, huh
Point that lil nigga out, huh
Point that nigga out, ooh
Point that lil nigga out
Uno I killed it, look look
Yung Shyne, can't forget the young baby
Walk inside the club, I won't forget my gun, nah
Now I'm the hottest there right under the sun
Lord he blessing me, I hope I don't blast nothin', yeah
They asked me when I got so cheap
I said I made so much money want to keep it all for me, I'm sorry
Like I'm Gleesh, leave your ass deceased
My pockets got a disease, it's called obesity, dig
Before you play me, you better play for keeps
'Cause I'll play you out your whole assist, ya dig, I got cheats
Trying to take over your whole turf, I got cleats
'Cause you pussy niggas like grass under my feet
So we point these niggas out, huh
Point that little nigga out, uh
Point that nigga out, huh
Point that little nigga out, ooh
Give a fuck 'bout what you sayin'
Heard you running your mouth
When I see 'em I'ma Pacquiao 'em

And I'm heavyweight
Winning like every bout
I'ma wrap shit like calamari
I'ma punch your belly in a bout
Point that nigga out, huh
Point that lil nigga out, huh
Point that nigga out, ooh
Point that lil nigga out
You're on point, but you're on point like a glitch
You're on point like a snitch, little bitty bitch
We don't point fingers, point red blinkers
Get money every time real niggas link up
I bought the chain different from the pendant, they still linked up
You penny pinchin', I told her to pass the scissors
Or pass the bitches, a four and a deuce might crash my liver
Might crash the kitchen, I'm living so rude from rags to riches
Might pull up official, pull out my ice, then pull all your bitches
Hop in the dish, hop in the Lamb, pull up and hit
I might hop in your bitch, hop out the bitch like I am her kid
Might be 'cause you faced up your lid, little bitch, we don't like it
So we point these niggas out, huh
Point that little nigga out, uh
Point that nigga out, huh
Point that little nigga out, ooh
Give a fuck 'bout what you sayin'
