Don't always think you're wrong when you're right
They'll always try to change your mind
Darling, just do whatever feels right
Your life is there to be designed

It's both a blessing and a curse
To feel everything so deeply like you do girl, I know
There's been more times that it hurts
But who said love was ever easy girl?

Life's a bitch and then you die
La, la, la, la, la, la

Oh, it's easier said than done
But don't you worry about those little things and bigger
What a find a relation
When you realise there's no voices in your head girl

Life's a bitch and then you die
La, la, la, la, la, la

When the world really gets you down
Don't be scared, don't be scared, no
All the little things you're worried 'bout
Ain't really there, really there, no

When the world really gets you down
Don't be scared, don't be scared, no
Ain't really there, really there, no
Been talking to yourself at night
I been thinking you should take that flight
Let it go if it don't feel right, yeah said

So won't you come and put your phone down?
You know you gotta leave that thing alone
You know it's real bad for you
Take a walk outside
'Cause life's a bitch and then you die

And then you die
And then you die
And then you die
