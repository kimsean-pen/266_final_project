What do you see when you close your eyes?
How do you feel when you see it?
Who is to say that it isn't real?
And why can't we learn to believe in
To believe in something

Look into the emptiness and step into the cold
Right between your body and your soul
Deep in inside of all of us there's something left to hold
Even when we give up all hope
There's space enough to grow
I know that we are all terminal

We sail on borrowed time
Its never about what we leave behind
It's how we live our lives
Look into the emptiness and step into the cold
Right between your body and your soul

Deep in inside of all of us there's something left to hold
Even when we give up all hope
There's space enough to grow
To grow
What do you see when you close your eyes?
