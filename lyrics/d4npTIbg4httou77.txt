Chorus
Lush life
Takes a little time
Lush life
Takes a little time
Take one step (one step) out of time
Boy I'm still in my prime
I want the lush life

A little base is what I want
Need a finer place to do my thang
I want no boys holding me back
Coz once I get there, there's no turning back
So don't be steppin to me
Don't need no one to choose me
(Don't need to one abusing me)

Chorus
Lush life
Takes a little time
Lush life
Takes a little time
Take one step out of time
Boy I'm still in my prime
I want the lush life

Aint no contesting what I want
Supply the beat and we'll do our thing
You may say it's all in my mind
To me it's the lush life
Although it may take some time
So don't be steppin to me
Don't need no one to choose me
(Don't need to one abusing me)

Chorus
Lush life
Takes a little time
Lush life
Takes a little time time
Take one step out of time
Boy I'm still in my prime
I want the lush life

Can't wait until the morning
Gotta see what I get for me
Gotta come onto the summer mornin
Look at me coz I can work it

Chorus
Lush life
Takes a little time
Lush life
Takes a little time
Take one step out of time
Boy I'm still in my prime
I want the lush life
