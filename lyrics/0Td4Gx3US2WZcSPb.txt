[Verse One:]
I've been sitting in the dirt (for 24 hours)
I've forgotten my own worth (for 24 hours)
Said that you'd be here last night

I'm trying to shake you from my skin (for 48 hours)
Clean up this mess I've been put in (for 48 hours)
I'm guessing you can't always win
I'm guessing you can't always win

[Chorus:]
I can't have anything I want
They say I'm just too young
But it's not my fault
I'll find my own way home if I gotta
I'll make it all alone if I gotta

[Verse Two:]
I'm not so trustful with my friends
I'm on the road alone again
I guess im tired of giving in

I'm sick of wishing you were near
You've gone your way, you've made it clear
Why do I feel you everywhere?
Why do I feel this everywhere?

[Chorus:]
I can't have anything I want
They say I'm just too young
But it's not my fault
I'll find my own way home if I gotta
I'll make it all alone if I gotta

[Bridge:]
Don't wanna spend my time
Watching the world go by
I think I'd rather die
And I don't got a plan
Not gonna justify
To stay where I stand
Something I won't deny

[Chorus:]
I can't have anything I want
They say I'm just too young
But it's not my fault
I'll find my own way home if I gotta
I'll make it all alone if I gotta

I can't have anything I want
They say I'm just too young
But it's not my fault
I'll find my own way home if I gotta
I'll make it all alone if I gotta

24 hours
24 hours
24 hours
24 hours
24 hours
