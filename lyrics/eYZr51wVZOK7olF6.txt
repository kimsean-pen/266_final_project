You've got such a pretty smile
It's a shame the things you hide behind it
Let 'em go, give it up, for a while
Let 'em free and we will both go find it

I know that there's nowhere you can hide it
I know the feeling of alone
I know that you do not feel invited
But come back, come back in from the cold

Step away then from the edge
Your best friend in life is not your mirror
Back away, come back away, come back away
Come back away, come back away, come back away
I am here and I will be forever and ever

I know that there's nowhere you can hide it
I know the feeling of alone
Trust me and don't keep that on the inside
Soon you'll, you'll be locked out on your own

You're not alone, you're not alone
And don't say you've never been told
I'll be with you till we grow old
Til I'm in the ground and I'm cold
I'm not sitting up here on some throne
I'll be with you till we're both gone
Like a dog you can always come home
Dig up a bone
Look around

I'm sorry now.
