I move through shadow
I go they go wherever
Don't they come in
Whenever I let em

I climb through the skylight
Whatever you're feeling is all right
Let you let go
Whatever you're feeling is natural

Low light at dawn
I'll love that song forever
It's a shadow
Let me know me better

I climb through the skylight
Whatever you're feeling is all right
Let me let go
Whatever you're feeling is natural
Whatever you're feeling is natural

Let me let go
Let me know me better

I climb through the skylight
Whatever you're feeling is all right
Let me let go
Whatever you're feeling is natural
Whatever you're feeling is natural
