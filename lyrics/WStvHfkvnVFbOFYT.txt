Lately I've been loosing sleep
Haunted by design
I'm my own worst enemy
When I try to close my eyes

Voices in my weary head
They never let me be
Turning every fear and dread
From a whisper to a scream

I keep searching, I can't find
Any kind of respite from the noise inside
The clock is laughing, don't ask me why
In the halls of my mind
I'm still haunted by design
Haunted by design

Restless scenes and fever dream
They're never giving away
When I should be counting sheep
I'm counting my last days

Soon the morning sun will rise
To overtake the moon
Like the ghost of death arrived
And took my love too soon

I keep searching, I can't find
Any kind of respite from the noise inside
The clock is laughing, don't ask me why
In the halls of my mind
I'm steel haunted by design
Haunted by design

Those who worry suffer twice
This I must concede
I think it's time to close my eyes
Slumber rescue me

I keep searching, I can't find
Any kind of respite from the noise inside
The clock is laughing, don't ask me why
In the halls of my mind
I'm steel haunted by design
Haunted by design
I'm haunted by design
Haunted by design
