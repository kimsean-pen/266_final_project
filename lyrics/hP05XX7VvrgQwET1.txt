We got the best years ahead
We know we do
We reach for love
It meets us on the headway
Blind to the upcoming eye
Caught in the fuss above
Right in the prime of your life
Struck by the force of us

And all because we trust two vines
Slowly growing right into your ears
Show me all the life
Lead us in your wind tonight
Two vines
Two vines

We're going out
Tonight, won't you come along?
We'll wake the dawn
[?] replaying memories
Fly to the sky up above
Caught into all of us
Right in the prime of our lives
Struck by the course of love

And all because we trust two vines
Slowly growing right into your ears
Show me all the life
Lead us in your wind tonight
Two vines
Two vines

I wonder what it's like
Slowly growing right into your ears
There's only one way tonight
Soon you'll see, soon you'll see the light
I wonder every time
Why go to a place that no one's ever been before?
There's only one ocean that can hold the door
No reason to rush, just take it slow
All the universe is humming with me

And all because we trust two vines
Slowly growing right into your ears
Show me all the life
Lead us in your wind tonight
Two vines
Slowly growing right into your ears
Show me all the life
Lead us in your wind tonight
Two vines
