Love
Take us all to task
Life
So full of broken glass
With mirrors in mind
We can lose our way in shadows
Only love
Only love

Light it up for me now
Can you love?
Bright as you can be
I'm not giving up
Give me all your glow
Colors show
Collide us both

Life
Long, deep, wide
Short, sweet
Vapor blink of eye
Take care of each other
It's easy if we try
Let the colors come alive
Only love
And only light
