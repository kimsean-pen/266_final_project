I'm starting to feel
We stay together out of fear of dying alone
I've been slipping through the years
My old clothes don't fit like they once did
So they hang like ghosts of the people I've been

It's like my heart can't be tamed
And I fall in love every day and I feel like a fool
I have to face the truth
That no one could ever look at me like you do
Like I'm something worth holding on to

And there's times I think of leaving
But it's something I'll never do
'Cause you can do better than me
But I can't do better than you
You can do better than me
But I can't do better than you
