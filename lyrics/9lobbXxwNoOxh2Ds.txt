Tell me am I on your mind
'Cause I'm struggling to keep you off mine
I'm losing sleep, we're losing time
As reality's becoming a lie

With all of the chances and all of the favors
And all of the people who helped get me by
You think that I'd wanna make a better impression
I'm somebody who they can't rely

I tried to run and wait it out
But I've become a mess of doubts
And I know I'm hard to be around

Too much, it's always too much
I'm addicted to the rush, oh yeah
Too much, it's always too much
'Cause I'm addicted to your love, oh

Tell me am I on your mind
'Cause I can't seem to get you off mine
Tell me am I on your mind, oh no

You know you're killing me with love
And I'm just using up your trust
I treat your love like it's a drug
'Cause I'm addicted to the rush, oh

Too much, it's always too much
I'm addicted to the rush, oh yeah
Too much, it's always too much
'Cause I'm addicted to your...
