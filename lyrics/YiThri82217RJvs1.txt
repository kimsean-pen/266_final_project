You'll always belong to the air
Belong to the rocks
Belong to the depths

I hope we don't say goodbye
Before we have another chance to go loving

You'll always belong to the nest
Belong to the mist
Belong to sadness

No goodbye kiss will make this soil forget
If we can have another chance to go loving

You'll always belong somewhere
Belong in a bed, a bed to share
The days roll down, but lite gets stale
Always, always running away

House to house, loved, unloved
No one home or misunderstood
I hope we get another chance to go loving
