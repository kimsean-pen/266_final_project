All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record, I love you, I love you

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record, I love you, I love you

When I found out that you were leaving me
I couldn't sleep thinking about
All the things that we've been through
Now all that I want to do is tell you that I miss you so much

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record, I love you, I love you

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record, I love you, I love you

Now that I'm on my own
I know that in time I'll find somebody new
So I'll go all alone without you but I still love you
You know I'll never live without you

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record, I love you, I love you

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record, I love you, I love you

I wish you'd change your ways soon enough
So we can be together
You just don't understand good enough
But now all we have is memories

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record, I love you, I love you

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record, I love you, I love you

Memories we shared
No one else could compare
Oh, I miss you, I miss you, oh I miss you

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record, I love you, I love you
