Light blue
Standing on the edge with you
Can't tell me what choice you gon' choose
You just leave me in the dark blue
Choose to
Put me out of misery
Now I'm starting to believe
You won't leave me in the dark blue

I don't know what I want
You don't know what you want to do
To do

Light blue
'Til the sun becomes our roof
And when I give my stuff to you
You'll be standing in the dark blue

You don' know what you want
I don't know what I want
You don't know what you want
I don't know what I want but you
But you

I don't know what I want
You don't know what you want to do
To do

Light blue
Standing on the edge with you
Light blue
Standing on the edge with you
Light blue
Standing on the edge with you
Light blue
Standing on the edge with you

You don't know what you want
I don't know what I want but you
