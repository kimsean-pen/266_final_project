never reply when you hit me
I'm off the grid you can't get me
Secure the bag like Gucci
Ya see me racked up can't miss me
I never go down with my hands up
Fuck the rounds we pour another cup
I kiss the wall down one knee
See me racked up can't miss me

Yo bitch gone yeah I took it and I smashed
No shame girl if you feeling yo self
If you wanna get up I might give a lil' help
If you wanna get up I might give a lil' help
If you wanna get up I might give a lil' help
