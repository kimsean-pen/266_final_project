I will stop, I will stop at nothing
Say the right things when electioneering
Trust I can rely on your vote
When I go forwards you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
Ha ha ha
Riot shields, voodoo economics
It's just business, cattle prods and the IMF
Trust I can rely on your vote
When I go forwards you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
