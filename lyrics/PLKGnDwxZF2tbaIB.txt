You're allowed to stay for a while.
I'm going to need your time to slow down and waste some time again.
I would have thought by now you'd be so sick of trying
Because I'm sick of hearing it so sick of listening to it.
Everybody tells me something, something different every time.
(You know I want to help you. You know I want to help you.)
I'll make up my own mind
Just let me sit here for a while.
