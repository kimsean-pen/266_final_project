Good morning, demon majesty
Shine like the diamond you are
One of the three, the epiphany
The father, the rising star
You give the satanic symphony
An overture titanic and black
I feel your love, the affinity
I'm glad your highness is back
I know your venom is winning
Master of shade and shame
Will you give us a new beginning
Or just orchestrate the end?

Open the gates
Splendor demon majesty
Hear the doomsday bell
Grand wonderful fantasy
Oh, you wear the pall
Splendor demon majesty
You, you are my all
A celebration of sin
You are

Good morning, demon majesty
The king of kings you are
Lead us into seduction
Bringer of truth and shock
In the light of a tortured horizon
Dunes in your eyes
There you stand at the devil's station
Death draws nigh

Open the gates
Splendor demon majesty
Hear the doomsday bell
Grand wonderful fantasy
You, you wear the pall
Splendor demon majesty
You are my all
A celebration of sin
You are

Splendor demon majesty
A grand wonderful fantasy

March to the sound
