It feels like its
the end of the rope

and I won't let go if you won't
and I won't say no if you won't

only love
it's caught here today
and I can't feel you

there's a fire in my fair spot
when i'm not near you

it's caught here today
and I can't feel you
there's fire in my place
when i'm not near you

hang on
