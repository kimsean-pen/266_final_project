Paper, glass and all this treasure
Hoping that the cigarette will last forever
Have my future branded on your favorite sweater
Told you, "your cologne reminds me of when I was better"

Aren't you afraid of knowing how we'll make it if the time comes? Yeah
Took us pacing down the alley, scared of everybody, shut down

Told me that you wanna see my face, I cut my hair short
Hot sweat, it's the middle of the summer and
the subway car is warming up, it's warming up
Slow dance through your palaces of
fiction, if you said it then just say it out
If you said it then just say it now

How'd you weigh to feel my gravity,
know that if you keep me quiet, I'll be kind
Early moon, call me from across the ocean
just to keep the TV static down, the static down
Watch your head, baby,
careful of the fire, if your head burns off then so do I
If your head burns off then so do I

Rollercoaster apprehension
Maybe it's my birthday that I shouldn't mention, no
The flash of a smile, you feel like a child
You laugh to your bones, well of that I'm so sure
I walk 'til I'm sore, I walk though I'm sore

Keeping all of your emotions hid behind up in a straight line
Have you ever seen the afternoon become a wild bright light?
Thee alone and out to dinner, punches out the front

Told me that you wanna see my face, I cut my hair short
Hot sweat, it's the middle of the summer and
the subway car is warming up, it's warming up
Slow dance through your palaces of
fiction, if you said it then just say it out
If you said it then just say it now

How'd you weigh to feel my gravity,
know that if you keep me quiet, I'll be kind
Early moon, call me from across the ocean
just to keep the TV static down, the static down
Watch your head, baby,
careful of the fire, if your head burns off then so do I
If your head burns off then so do I

Spinning ropes around your throat, breathe
Spun the ropes until you couldn't breathe
Found a knuckle in my bruised cheek
Found a knuckle in my bruised cheek
Spinning ropes around your throat, breathe
Spun the ropes until you couldn't breathe
Found a knuckle in my bruised cheek
Found a knuckle in my bruised cheek

Moved far away
(Spinning ropes around your throat, breathe)
(Spun the ropes until you couldn't breathe)
For your self-found rush
(Found a knuckle in my bruised cheek)
(Found a knuckle in my bruised cheek)

Like an athlete on the grass plains
(Spinning ropes around your throat, breathe)
Kept you busy as on everything (Spun
the ropes until you couldn't breathe)
Summer passes and you're still the
same (Found a knuckle in my bruised cheek)
Winter comes and with the growing pain,
strong (Found a knuckle in my bruised cheek)
