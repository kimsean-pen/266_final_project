I hear something hanging on the wind
I see black smoke up around the bend
I've got my ticket and I'm going to go
Home

The leaves have changed a time or two
Since the last time the train came through
I've got my ticket and I'm going to go
Home

My father's father's blood is on the tracks
A sweet refrain drifts in from the past
I've got my ticket and I'm going to go
Home

The winding roads that led me here
Burn like coal and dry like tears
So here's my hope, my tired soul
Here's my ticket, I want to go
Home
