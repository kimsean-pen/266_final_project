Dance women, this complacency is killing me
Humans, did to you, Scarlet's birthday party yeah
It's all gonna be OK
It's all gonna be OK

Suitcase, trashman, lots of dirt going into the sea
It's Presidents, vomit, discounts on gasoline
It's all gonna be OK
It's all gonna be OK

Can't make sense with bad directions,
black, white yellow, red, blue and green
Man, woman, woman, trans, gay, none, all or straight
It's all gonna be OK, 'cos we are all the same
It's all gonna be OK

I say, I am everything, I might notice
that you've done everything
It's all gonna be OK, it's all gonna end someday
It's all gonna be OK

Ooooh!
