Oh Elijah, don't make me wait
Nobody's winning
The sharks are swimming in the red

Oh Elijah, don't make me wait
While you are sleeping
My mind goes creaking down the wall

Slow down, dilettante
So i can limp beside you
And follow in your rush too

Hang on, street savant
My bank in my pocket
How far you think you'll take us?

You're like a party I heard through a wall
I'm always watching you through a lucky hole?
Let's not forget, lets not forget
Why we crawled here

Oh Elijah, don't make me wait
I got no patience for an estrangement, anyway

Wake up, avenue C
Your hometown is still sleeping

You're like a party I heard through the wall
Invite me
But I'm always watching you through a lucky hole?
Let's not forget
Where we crawled from

Oh Elijah, don't make me wait
What is so pressing?
You can't undress me, anyway

Oh Elijah, don't make me wait
Nobody's winning
The sharks are swimming in the red
