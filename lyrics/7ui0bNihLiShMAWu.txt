Pulling me, I can't breathe
Rescue me, darkness consuming
Tempting me, suffering
Break me free from the darkness inside me

Shadows take my hands as my mind begins to stray
I'm lost in captive eyes, I can't seem to look away
Testing my will, trying my faith
I'm drenched in my sins, I am dripping with shame
Defying my reasons, denying my heart
I descend to hellfire, I am torn apart

I need somebody to deliver me from hell
I can't seem to find myself
I could use some help
Deliver me from hell

The serpent sends a smile and the apple is laced
I tiptoe into the void, I long for the taste
The perversive pictures are fixed in my mind
I'm worshipping fiction, the blind lead the blind

I need somebody to deliver me from hell
I can't seem to find myself
I could use some help
Deliver me from hell

The devil whispers to me
I'll never be saved
The shovel pushes deeper and deeper
I'm digging my own grave
The devil whispers to me
I'll never be saved
The shovel pushes deeper and deeper
I'm digging my own grave
The devil whispers to me
I'll never be saved
The shovel pushes deeper
I'm digging my own grave
The devil whispers to me
I'll never be saved
The shovel pushes deeper
I'm digging my own grave

Pulling me, I can't breathe
Pulling me, I can't breathe
Pulling me, I can't breathe
Pulling me, I can't breathe
Pulling me, I can't breathe
Pulling me, I can't breathe
