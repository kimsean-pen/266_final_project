We were just kids
Ignoring what our parents said
Sneaking down to the basement
Was it really love we were chasing
Were we just tryna get away, but truth is
It was a high we never tasted
As we were lying there naked
Is she gonna find that other places
Oh, she did

So I tell ya a heartbreak won't break ya
I let you know I sleep just fine
Even though the worlds gonna shake ya
The view is always worth the climb
If there's another risk worth take it
Go and take it every time
Life is only what you make it

I think we made it out alright
I think we made it out alright
I think we made it out alright
I think we made it out alright

We were just kids
Ignoring what our parents did
Playing songs in the basement
Barely knew what we were saying
Were we just tryna run away, but truth is
It was a high we never tasted
While looking out on all the faces
Is everybody gonna hate it
Well they did

So I tell ya a heartbreak won't break ya
I let you know I sleep just fine
Even though the worlds gonna shake ya
The view is always worth the climb
If there's another risk worth take it
Go and take it every time
Life is only what you make it

I think we made it out alright
I think we made it out alright
I think we made it out alright
I think we made it out alright

You are not alone
No one knows the way to go
You are not alone
No one knows the way to go
You are not alone
No one knows the way to go
You are not alone
And I think we made it out alright

I think we made it out alright
I think we made it out alright
I think we made it out alright
I think we made it out alright
I think we made it out alright
I think we made it out alright
I think we made it out alright
