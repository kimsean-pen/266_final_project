Are you quiet as your name
On the day before it came?
Are you in the meaning
That it sang in me with its sound?
What name are you saying now?

Every dream stuck in my mouth
Talking north and talking south
You said you believed me
As the sun will rise without a doubt
Are you believing me now?

You are a color now I keep with the dawn
I'm gonna keep it right until it is gone
You are a color now I keep with the dawn

Is the creek where you first swam
Bending all your breaths to sand?
If I looked in its mirror
Washing over me
Bending me down?

You are a color now I keep with the dawn
It's gonna get me back where I belong
You are a color now I keep with the dawn
You are a color now I keep with the dawn
