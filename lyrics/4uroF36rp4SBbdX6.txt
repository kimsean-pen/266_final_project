If you've got troubles let them go
Let them soar so high
High into the sky
Just like a red balloon
Don't let your worries get to you
Let them float on by
High into the sky
Just like a red balloon

Monday morning
Shoot up like a rocket
Yeah the sun is shining
Keep it in my pocket
Got this golden feeling
Never gonna stop it
Just goes on and on

Keep on clapping
Join the celebration
Turn the music louder
On my favourite station
Wanna spread my magic
All across the nation
Do it all day long

Today I opened my eyes and now I'm so happy and free
I got my friends by my side and that's all that matters to me
So come on get up and join in cos' this is just what you need
Let's do it all day long

Today I opened my eyes and now I'm so happy and free

If you've got troubles let them go
Let them soar so high
High into the sky
Just like a red balloon
Don't let your worries get to you
Let them float on by
High into the sky
Just like a red balloon

So turn it up now

Bee's are buzzing
Butterflies are dancing
And the trees are humming
Birds are singing songs
Oh can't you see it's lovely?
Life is beautiful
And it goes on and on

Today I opened my eyes and now I'm so happy and free
I got my friends by my side and that's all that matters to me
So come on get up and join in cos' this is just what you need
Let's do it all day long
