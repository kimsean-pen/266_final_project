Say it baby

Night on the street
It's a silver moon
Going out real late
And out of the darkness they come
Like last night, only more
What's shaking in that little silk dress?
Warm winds blowing
Like you're wearing a little purple dress

Say it babe
So all the people know
So all the people know

You girls are so sweet
Moving about, coming in closer
Cindy tapping that foot
Say it baby
Say it babe
So all the people know

Shuffle starter
Dancing, we are together
Dean and Cindy and [?] too
Diane and [?]
Got me dizzy
Like in a swirling dream
What's going on here?
Circling around me
High heeled shoes, clicking and [?]
Girls moving, this way and that
Got me dreaming

Say it baby
Say it babe
Say it babe
Say it babe
Say it babe
So all the people know
So all the people know
Just say it, baby
Say it baby
You've gotta tell me you love me
You love me baby
Tell me you love me baby
Tell me you love me baby
