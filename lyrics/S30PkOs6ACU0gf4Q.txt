Nobody taught me about the cages
Lord, i can see the pain from here
Saying wake me up and show me, please
Wake me up and save me

Don't leave, don't leave, leave me
Oh
Don't leave, don't leave
Cause now i see ya, now i breathe ya
Now i feel ya oh oh oh

I remember back to October
Please be good to me
October, please be good to me
October, woah October, please
October, oh oh

I was never meant to hide it
But oh they can see it all so clear
If they won't wake me up and show me
They're not gonna take me home, they're not gonna save me

Don't leave, don't leave. leave me
Oh
Don't leave, don't leave
Cause now i see ya
Now i breathe ya
Now i feel ya oh oh oh

I remember back to October
Please be good to me
October, please be good to me
October, woah October, please
October, oh

Oh and just like you, i get charmed by the words of the day and just like you
I lived by these words
But these words won't

Wake me up and save me
So I'm gonna take me home and im gonna save me...

I remember back to October
Please be good to me
October, please be good to me x3

October, woah October, please x2

October please be good to me x4

October
