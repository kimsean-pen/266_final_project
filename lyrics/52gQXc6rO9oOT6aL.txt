Hey kids!
Hey dad!
What do you want to do today?
We don't know!
Do you want to go to the matinee?
No!
Do you want to go to the amusement park?
No!
Do you want to go to the punk rock show?
YEAH! Let's go to the punk rock show!

Lost in a sea of combat boots, flush the bouncers with wasted youth
When did punk rock become so safe, when did the scene become a joke
The kids who used to live for beer and speed now want their fries and coke
Cursing and (flipping) birds are not allowed, in fact let's keep noise levels down

MUST SEPARATE THE CHURCH AND SKATE

Why don't we put pads on the kids, helmets, head gear and mouth pieces
Then we could pad the floors and walls, put cameras inside bathroom stalls
We make sure only nice bands play, make every show a matinee
Teach kids to be all they can be, and we could sing my country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty, BLEH!

When did punk rock become so safe
I know it wasn't Duane or Fletcher, who put up the barricades
Like a stake in the heart, somehow we got driven apart

I want conflict I want dissent, I want the scene to represent
Our hatred of authority, our fight against complacency
Stop singing songs about girls and love, you killed the owl you freed the dove
Confrontation and politics replaced with harmonies and shticks
When did punk rock become so tame, these fucking bands all sound the same
We want our fights we want our thugs, we want our burns we want our drugs
Where is the violent apathy, these fuckin' records rated G

WHEN DID PUNK ROCK BECOME SO SAFE?
