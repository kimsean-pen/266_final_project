It's a strange thing in life
When you're chasing your dreams
and it's not what it seems
And your heart is on the line
And I don't wanna be the one fading

Am I out of my mind?
Do I got it all wrong don't I have what I want?
God I try to make it right
And I don't wanna be the one waiting

She said Jake you're a little bit stoned
When you gonna get grown
Would you just go home I'm so not sure
Could you help yourself
I can't help you anymore
You're going faster than me
Too little too late I don't think I'm gonna stay
I don't think you're gonna change
I'm so not sure
Could you help you help yourself
I can't help you anymore
You're going faster than me

But I can't slow down now
The lights just went down, down

There's a cost, there's a price
Yeah you really feel the fallout wraping your heart out
Night after night
When all you ever wanted was some hometown
I'm not thinking sober but i don't think it's over
I can't lie
But I can use a little bit alone time

She said Jake you're a little bit stoned
When you gonna get grown
Would you just go home I'm so not sure
Could you help yourself
I can't help you anymore
You're going faster than me
Too little too late I don't think I'm gonna stay
I don't think you're gonna change
I'm so not sure
Could you help you help yourself
I can't help you anymore
You're going faster than me

But I can't slow down now
The lights just went down, down, down
Baby hold on somehow
Cuz I can't slow down now
No I can't slow down now
I'm not thinking sober but i don't think it's over
I can't lie
But I can use a little bit alone time

She said Jake you're a little bit stoned

Would you just go home I'm so not sure
Could you help yourself
I can't help you anymore
You're going faster than me
Too little too late I don't think I'm gonna stay
I don't think you're gonna change
I'm so not sure
Could you help you help yourself
I can't help you anymore
You're going faster than me

But I can't slow down now
The lights just went down, down, down
Baby hold on somehow
Cuz I can't slow down now
No I can't slow down now
