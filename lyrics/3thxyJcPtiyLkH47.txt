Tell me that you need me now
'Cause in my dreams you're still around
You've been gone for quite some time
It finally feels like you're not mine

Will you remember me?
'Cause I'll remember you
Yeah, you

You went out and found somebody new
And that still hurts
It's taken everything inside my bones
To say these words
Even if it's not with me
I just want you to be happy
I just want you to be happy

I was torn and I was numb
I needed you but you needed anyone
I was bad but now I'm well
I had to lose you to find myself

Will you remember me?
'Cause I'll remember you
Yeah, you

You went out and found somebody new
And that still hurts
It's taken everything inside my bones
To say these words
Even if it's not with me
I just want you to be happy

Nine months since I last saw you
And three months since we last spoke
Say, "happy birthday," to you
Then I let you go
Tell me that you need me now
'Cause in my dreams you're still around
