There's no here
It's not clear
Disappear

'cause of you, 'cause of me too
when you do, I believed you
'cause of you, 'cause of me too
when you do, I believed you

I gave up
It's not much
It's not enough

I know we can't exist, I know we can't exist
'cause I'm on and on, 'cause I'm on and on
I know you can't resist, I know you can't resist
'cause I did it wrong, 'cause I did it wrong

I know I can't move on
I know I should be gone
I know they say they're right
... about me now
But I really don't know how

'cause of you, 'cause of me too
when you do, I believed you
'cause of you, 'cause of me too
when you do, I believed you

In a state
Came too late
Shouldn't wait

I know we can't exist, I know we can't exist
'cause I'm on and on, 'cause I'm on and on
I know you can't resist, I know you can't resist
'cause I did it wrong, 'cause I did it wrong

And now that time has gone
