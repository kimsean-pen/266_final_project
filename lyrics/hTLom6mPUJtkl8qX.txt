A ghost passes through you
I feel it and I scream
Search lights pry at my dreams
This is my memory

A lonely series
Repeats without even a pause
Floating weightless
Uninterrupted until I exhale

Ghosts have no shadows
They must conspire for even one
Yearning for a solid heart
I feel an angel present

Glowing drifting
I remember tomorrow
Spin drift snow screen
Floating down in a spiral from an endless heaven above
