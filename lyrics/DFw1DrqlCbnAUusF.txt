As I pen these things, it might literally be all I have: ink on paper
Does any of this matter?
Then I'm reminded of what I've seen
The places I love and the people I've been

Only love could have brought me to this place
Holding in me a joyful heart while spit covers my face
I've come to forgive those who've wronged me
Knowing that they've helped make me into exactly who you intended me to be

I'm trying my best, to be a better man
Despite all my fears, I really am
I'm trying my best, I'm trying my best to be a better man
Despite all my fears, I really am

I write these things to remind myself
That amidst this darkness, there still remains light, hope, and a perfect plan
For the first time in my life I am writing for the sake of writing
Living for the sake of living
Loving for the sake of loving
And I'll live

So you can call this sort of life a hopeless endeavor
That this tiny vessel could ever endure such violent weather
Call it pointless, I'll continue to carry out Grace none the less
I will scream it 'til my face is blue

There is a point to all of this, and it's always been you
