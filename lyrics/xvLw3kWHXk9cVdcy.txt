Your room was square
I once noticed from there
In your bed, as you slept,
And I held my breath
Everything had its own place
And I wondered what space would I take
In the order you kept

I tried to eat like your girlfriend
Just tea in the night, I'd end up
Too hungry to sleep
So lying awake, I would follow the aching inside,
I would find
It's for you won't be mine

I tried my hardest, for I'd never learned
God's very simple and love shouldn't burn
And I would've offered you all that you yearned for
But I was still waiting for something to earn

What is that quiet of snow in the night?
The dark rings with white noise
As you stand and drown
Maybe it's all of these snowflakes, screaming
A choir of mute
As they brace for the ground

Well that's my ride
Hope you had a good night
You know, you made me happy
Here shake my hand
You make such a good man
Never once did you know me

I tried my hardest, for I'd never learned
God's very simple and love doesn't burn
And maybe you offered me all that I yearned for
But I was still waiting for something to earn

Silly me, waiting.
