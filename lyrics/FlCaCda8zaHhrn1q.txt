And I changed a lot since then ask my friends
The crying stopped, on top of that my eyes forgot
And old flame who got her hips on a bucket list
And times missed every night since we first kissed.

Oh lover when you call me out pull me up to ground mouth to mouth
Oh lover when you call me out.

Do you feel like breaking my fall? Love I feel like nothing at all
If you feel like breaking my fall
You can tell me boy I want more

And I've changed a lot since then ask my friends
My clothes my frame I've spent enough but feel the same
Well times change, bodies go while mine remans
Now her laughters a rhyme, shoulder melody, neck the first line

Oh lover when you call me out pull me up to ground mouth to mouth
Oh lover when you call me out

Do you feel like breaking my fall?
Love I feel like nothing at all
If you feel like breaking my fall you can tell me: boy I want more

And I'll be waiting when you come and call. Give it away give it away.
I can burn that bridge when we get to it. give it away give it away

Do you feel like breaking my fall
Tell me it meant nothing at all

And if you feel like breaking my
fall you can tell me: boy I want more.
