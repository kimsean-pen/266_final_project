I wanna take you
I wanna take you to the ocean

Though the sun is out of view
It's reflected on the moon
And its lighting up the room
So you sing another tune
And I remember

No one can save you, you're under their spell
No one can save you at all
No one can touch you and no one can see
No one can save you

I wanna take you
I wanna take you to the ocean
I wanna hold you
Hold you down beneath the waves
I wanna feel you
Feel you struggle in the water
I wanna hear you
I wanna hear you when you say

There's an evil in your eye
There's a weight upon your mind
There's an evil in your eye
There's a weight upon your mind

No one can save you, you're under their spell
No one can save you at all
No one can touch you and no one can see
No one can save you

I wanna take you
I wanna take you to the mountain
I wanna show you
I wanna show you what I've seen
I'm gonna push you
I'm gonna push you to the edge now
I wanna see you
Looking down at where you'll be

Though the sun is out of view
It's reflected on the moon
And its lighting up the room
So you sing another tune
And I remember

No one can save you, you're under their spell
No one can save you at all
No one can touch you and no one can see
No one can save you
No one can save you at all
