Lurking in the dismal fog, hungry for your blood
Seeking harmless victims, satisfy my needs
Schizophrenic lunatic, uncontrolled desire
Rape and ravage lady fair, pledged to die

No apparent motive, kill and kill again
Survive my brutal thrashing, I'll hunt you till the end
My life's a constant battle, the rage of many men
Homicidal maniac

Trapped in mortal solitude, lift the gleaming blade
Slice her flesh to shreds, watch the blood flow free
Hatred growing stronger, none survive my wrath
Suffer from the throbbing pain, yield your life to me

No apparent motive, kill and kill again
Survive my brutal thrashing, I'll hunt you till the end
My life's a constant battle, the rage of many men
Homicidal maniac

Kill the preacher's only son, watch the infant die
Bodily dismemberment, drink the purest blood
Unrelenting need to kill, death upon you now
Anxiously awaiting next in line

No apparent motive, kill and kill again
Survive my brutal thrashing, I'll hunt you till the end
My life's a constant battle, the rage of many men
Homicidal maniac

Kill again!
