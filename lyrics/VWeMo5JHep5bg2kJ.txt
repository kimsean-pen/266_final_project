At city's centre 9 PM
Just like you wrote
And i try to think about
Snow coming in
Just like before
I will be on stand-by

Releasing the vapour
Into the lung
Letting the wings unfurl
And for a moment i feel young
I call on the bird
Unfurl

It's time to chose side now
That's what you said
When we talked on the phone
So white our eyes
You are still
Are you paralyzed?

Releasing the vapour
Into the lung
Letting the wings unfurl
And for a moment i feel young
I call on the bird
Unfurl
Unfurl
Unfurl
