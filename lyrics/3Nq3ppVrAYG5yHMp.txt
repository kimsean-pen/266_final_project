Oh my, my heart is so black
You find it insane to apologize for something like that
It won't revolve around me
Or how I feed on almost every inappropriate thing
We know the guy who drew the map
But he's a graveyard away
He never wanted to stay
I was painting red
I never read the actual words
Or the kind of fate that I get
You said they called you no shoes
Man, we all make mistakes
I swear to God it wasn't just you
I found the guy who found the map
He's going insane
He can't remember my name
He can't remember my name
And it was just like you said
We got back to the mansion
Bowed both our heads
I saw a flash in the sky
I recall you saying there's noone there
But the devil and I
I am a man who proved the map is wrong
It's never the same
It's undeniable change
It's undeniable change
What a deniable waste
What a deniable waste
