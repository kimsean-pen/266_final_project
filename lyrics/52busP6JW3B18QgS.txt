Two doors down
They're laughing and drinkin', and having a party and
Two doors down
They're not aware that I'm around

But here I am
Crying my heart out, feelin' sorry while
They're having a party just two doors down

I think I'll dry these useless tears
And get myself together
I think I'll wander down the hall
And have a look around
'Cause I can't stay inside
This lonely room and cry forever
I think I really rather join 'em
Two doors down, yeah

Two doors down
They're laughing and drinkin', and having a party
Two doors down
They aren't aware that I'm around

'Cause here I am
No longer cryin' an' feelin' sorry
We're having a party just two doors down

I can't believe I'm standin' here
Dry-eyed, all smiles and talkin'
Making conversation with the new love
I have found
I ask him if he'd like to be alone and we start walkin'
Down the hall to my place waitin' two doors down, yeah

Two doors down
They're laughing and drinkin'
and having a party and
Two doors down
We're not aware that they're around

'Cause here I am
Feelin' everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Two doors down
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Two doors down
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Two doors down
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Two doors down, oh

Two doors down
They're laughing and drinkin', and having a party
Two doors down
We're not aware that they're around

'Cause here we am
Feelin' everything but sorry
We're havin' our own party
Two doors down, yeah

Two doors down
They're laughing and drinkin', and having a party and
Two doors down
We're not aware that they're around
