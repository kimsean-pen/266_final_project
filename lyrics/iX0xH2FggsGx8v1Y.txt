Blimps go 90 on with the show
Couldn't you see that?
Now didn't you know?
Aerosol halos---films of the flag
Rifle games for seven-year-olds
What a drag
Yeah now that's a drag
This is not a vacation
There is no place to go
Weep, sad freaks of the nation
Where blimps go 90
And you won't find me
Senator sipping on Gentleman Jack
"Oh boy" they told me "now don't you look back"
But don't you worry
I promise to not
I'll join your Canary Court
Fit into the slot
Say now what have you got?
Oftentimes I'm reminded
Of the sweet young days
When I poured punch for the franchise
And thus was knighted
Got so excited
Blimps go 90 on with the show
Couldn't you see that?
Now didn't you know?
Hey now didn't you know?
