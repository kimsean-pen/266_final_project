Howdy, friend
Beggin' your pardon
Is there somethin' on your mind?
You've gone and sold
All your belongings
Is that something in your eye?

Well, I know
You really never
Liked the way it all goes down
Go on, hideaway

What's that you say?
We're all bound for the graveyard
Ooh, I wish you well
Think it's gonna rain
Oh, what's the diff'rence?
Is there someway I can help?

'Cause you know
I'm gonna miss you
When you're gone, oh, Lord
Wish I could hideaway

Hold on
Give yourself a chance
I can hear the leavin' train

All aboard
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Oo, I wish you well
See you soon
Maybe tomorrow
You never can tell

'Cause you know
I'm gonna miss you
When you're gone, whoa
Wish I could hideaway
Hideaway, hideaway
Hideaway, hideaway
Hideaway, hideaway
Hideaway, hideaway
