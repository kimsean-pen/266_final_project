Feeling erodes
moving like wash against the limestone
leaving you cold
when I'm leaving you all alone.

Hugging the walls
finding the switch to turn the light on
to find you in a ball
wrapped in the bedding. But

You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember.
You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember.
Feeling disarmed, a little raw, and decentered.
You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember.

What if we don't?
What if we never know?

You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember.
Clutching you close your body felt like December
shook awake early from the rock of your tremors.
Tracing my thumb over the miles of your memory.
Now a bit brighter with a smile and a laughter.
One in the same and what am I to be after,
dancing in private with the concept of never?
You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember.
Coming around again,
making some space to mend,
gaining the strength to stand,
feeling the love again.
