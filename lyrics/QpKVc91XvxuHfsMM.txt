Burning here in the room
Feeling that the walls are moving closer
Silent scene, the dark takes me
Leads me to the ending of another day
I'm haunted

Tell me who you are, I am spellbound
You cannot have this control on me
Everywhere I go, I am spellbound
I will break the spell you put on me

Velvet drapes, glowing candles
Silent whispers of words inside of my head
The night that comes, it waits for me
Lifts me to the ending of another day
I'm haunted

Tell me who you are, I am spellbound
You cannot have this control on me
Everywhere I go, I am spellbound
I will break the spell you put on me

Tell me who you are, I am spellbound
You cannot have this control on me
Everywhere I go, I am spellbound
I will break the spell you put on me
Everywhere I go, I am spellbound
Everywhere I go, I am spellbound
Everywhere I go, I am spellbound
I will break the spell you put on me
