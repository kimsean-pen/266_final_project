You can see me coming from a mile off
Once again ignite the skyline
She's gonna be printed on money
Just like your royal family
(This ain't no holiday)
This time there can be no funeral
I'm vibing, can't you feel me?

We love Rohypnol, she got Rohypnol
We take Rohypnol
Just forget it all
We love Rohypnol, she got Rohypnol
We take Rohypnol
Just forget it all
Just forget it all

This baby's got a temper
This baby's got a temper
This baby's got a temper
You'll never tame her

You can see me do another parallel
Better bow down your not worthy
(Hey get off my planet, Yeah)
Last time I'll be your prisoner
No name no number
(revolving, dissolving)
Shooting through the trap door
What I think don't matter anymore

We love Rohypnol, she got Rohypnol
We take Rohypnol
Just forget it all
We love Rohypnol, she got Rohypnol
We take Rohypnol
Just forget it all

This baby's got a temper
This baby's got a temper
This baby's got a temper
You'll never tame her
This baby's got a temper
You'll never tame her
