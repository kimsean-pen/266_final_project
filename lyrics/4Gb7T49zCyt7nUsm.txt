Get up

I'm paranoid, I'm sick, I'm not myself
I bottled up and drank the pain, but it wouldn't stay down
Now I've got nothing to give, nothing to say for myself
I'm nothing more than worm food six feet under the ground, fuck

Malice, malice, malice
This is the death of me

It's eating away at me, this disgusting disease
I'm fucking sick, my stomach's starting to bleed
It's eating away at me, I don't know what to do
I'm fucking sick, I'll never be like you

Malice, malice, malice, malice

I don't believe in salvation, but I believe in demons
And I'll let you meet mine if you really wanna see them
Once you go mad and slip through the cracks
The path is too dark to see the tracks
I was consumed by the dark, consumed by the black
I made a deal with the devil I can't take back

It's eating away at me, this disgusting disease
I'm fucking sick, my stomach's starting to bleed
It's eating away at me, I don't know what to do
I'm fucking sick, I'll never be like you

What's the point? What's the fucking point in any of this
If, when we make it to the grave, everyone just forgets?
What's the point? What's the fucking point in any of this
If, when we make it to the grave, no one gives a shit?

Malice, malice

There's no more good left in me, and I hope that you never meet
This person that I've become, this ugly fucking disease
It's eating away at me, this disgusting disease
I'm fucking sick, I'm not normal, and I can finally breathe
