Your ways
Tipping me over
Darkest woman
Taking all

Your ways
Taking me over
bottom talked to the hook

I'll let him
I'll fall

You spend the night
without love

Your ways
Tipping me over

All living is
taking me over
There's a true sin
calling for the night

All living is
taking me over
There's a true sin
calling for the night

Gotta love what you said
Stop taking me over
forgot what it means to apologize

Sedna looked at the sea
All your love it starts slow
lonely where it's calling for the close

And your ways...
