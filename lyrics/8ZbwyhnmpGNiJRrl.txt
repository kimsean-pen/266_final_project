When words are softer spoken
They often sound the best
But now the winter woven
They burn in my chest

I'm all used up and out of steam
Vacationing somewhere in between
I'm sitting in catharsis
And the other cold empty
In one I feel so common
In the other I am royalty

I'm seeking out a place
One to give me peace
And everything between
I'm seeking out a place
One to give me peace
'Cause ever since you died
I can't control anything

Everything feels numb
Built from catastrophe
Just when I get a hold
It slips away from me
I've always relied on melody
I've come to rely on love
But there's an absence in my heart
When I know I never???
