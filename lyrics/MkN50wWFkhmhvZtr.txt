never gonna ya do it
a world below
heather angel you are somewhere
on the show
don't you think you would find
where to go
I want to go dancing on the other side
I want to buy a phonograph
but the money's gone
he bought books and records
I don't care about that
I just want to be alive
and go to the other...
I don't want money or books
have to decide
passive
and you were shot in the name of it
and then you'd see yeh, yeh
then you'd see
the relationship
and walking I see you in the clouds
and I fall for
I would fall for you
I would...
forever
goodbye, bye
goodbye
and that is all
STOP STOP
