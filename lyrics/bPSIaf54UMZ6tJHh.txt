Watching puddles gather rain
There's no better place to lay
She's as fine as dandelions blowin' in the wind
She's not thinkin' about anything

She floats
She floats
Floats

Wearin' black patent Mary Janes
She steps out into the rain
She's as dry as clear blue skies
Swallowing you whole
God knows secrets though I'm told

She floats
She floats
Floats

Mmm mmm mmm
Ahh ahh ahh
Mmm mmm mmm
(Aaa aaa)
(Aaa aaa)
(Aaa aaa)
(Aaa aaa)

Aah ahh uh
She's as fine as dandelions blowin' in the wind
She's not thinkin', she's listening

She floats
She floats
Floats
Floats

She floats
She floats
Floats
