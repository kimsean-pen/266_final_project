Strollin' in the park, watching winter turn to spring
Walkin' in the dark, seein' lovers do their thing, mmm

That's the time I feel like making love to you.
That's the time I feel like making dreams come true.

In a restaurant, holdin' hands by candlelight.
When you're touchin' me, wanting you with all my might.

That's the time I feel like making love to you.
That's the time I feel like making dreams come true.

When you talk to me, when you're moanin' sweet & low.
When you're touchin' me and my feelin's start to show.

That's the time I feel like making love to you.
That's the time I feel like making dreams come true.

Strollin' in the park, watching winter turn to spring
Walkin' in the dark, seein' lovers do their thing, mmm

That's the time I feel like making love to you.
That's the time I feel like making dreams come true.
