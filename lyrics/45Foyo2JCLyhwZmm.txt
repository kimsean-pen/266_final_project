Hey!
Hey!

I keep on longing for you
Nighttime is when I hear you
Couldn't see this storm'd be coming
I need you

I still dream about you
Contemplating what we had
Listen to the doctor's order
I need you

For all the things that I do to myself
All the things that I do to myself
All the things that I do to myself

You got me fucked up
Stripped down to my bones
But I'm breathing
Breathing for the night and you know
Here I come
Hey

Here I come

Wake up when the worst has started
I need a shine in all this darkness
I keep on falling harder
For your love

Knock knock I'm getting ready
Drinking from a new addiction
I know you got your own prescription
And I got mine

All the things that I do to myself
All the things that I do to myself
All the things that I do to myself

You got me fucked up
Stripped down to my bones
But I'm breathing
Breathing for the night and you know
Here I come
Hey

Here I come

Here I come
You got me fucked up
Stripped down to my bones
But I'm breathing
Breathing for the night and you know
Here I come
Hey
