They all hit the town
Get to getting around
Find a body who can hold 'em tight
You know it's true what they say
Nobody can fall in love in LA on a Saturday night
All the boys and the girls on top of the world
In the morning they realise
That it's true what they say
Nobody can fall in love in LA on a Saturday night

God, I hate this fucked up city
People flip on the turn like the lights on the boulevard
They get dressed up just to lay down
With a guy, with a girl, with whoever's got a broken heart

They all hit the town
Get to getting around
Find a body who can hold 'em tight
You know it's true what they say
Nobody can fall in love in LA on a Saturday night
All the boys and the girls on top of the world
In the morning they realise
That it's true what they say
Nobody can fall in love in LA on a Saturday night
You know it's true what they say
Nobody can fall in love in LA on a Saturday night

God, I love this fucked up city
If you roll the right dice you can wake up a millionaire
We're all dreamers, far from angels
Yeah, we trade in our wings just to find that nobody cares

They all hit the town
Get to getting around
Find a body who can hold 'em tight
You know it's true what they say
Nobody can fall in love in LA on a Saturday night
All the boys and the girls on top of the world
In the morning they realise
That it's true what they say
Nobody can fall in love in LA on a Saturday night
You know it's true what they say
Nobody can fall in love in LA on a Saturday night

God, I love this fucked up city

They all hit the town
Get to getting around
Find a body who can hold 'em tight
You know it's true what they say
Nobody can fall in love in LA on a Saturday night
All the boys and the girls on top of the world
In the morning they realise
That it's true what they say
Nobody can fall in love in LA on a Saturday night
You know it's true what they say
Nobody can fall in love in LA on a Saturday night

You know it's true what they say
Nobody can fall in love in LA on a Saturday night
