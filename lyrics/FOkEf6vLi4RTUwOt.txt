tell me
tell me
tell me

Tell you miss me, oh tell me you're sorry
Don't say another word, no don't say anything
Meanwhile, my world is deflating
And you just keep on running
Straight through the desert,
Yeah straight into midnight
Where i can not find you
i can't recognise you
oh sweet bird of my youth
Where have you flown to?

Now let's make one thing clear as crystal
The blood is on your hands
The blood is on your hands
And the blood will stain your hands
And everything you touch
And everything you learn
Oh sweet bird of my youth
Where have you flown to?
Now i can not find you
No, i can't recognise you
Sweet bird, sweet bird
Now i don't want, i don't want you to leave
But i don't know what else to do
No i don't know what else to do

Come on let it in child
