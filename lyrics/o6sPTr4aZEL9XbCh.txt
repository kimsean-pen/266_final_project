If I had eyes in the back of my head
I would've told you that you looked good as I walked away

And if you could've tried to trust the hand that fed
You would've never been hungry, but you'd never really be

More of this or less of this or is there any difference?
Or are we just holding on to things that we don't have anymore?

Sometimes time doesn't heal
No, not at all
It just stands still
While we fall
In or out of love, again I doubt
I'm gonna win you back
When you've got eyes like that
That won't let me in
Always looking out

A lot of people spend their time just floating
We were victims together, but lonely
You've got hungry eyes that just can't look forward
Can't give them enough, but we just can't start over
Building with bent nails, we're falling, but holding
I don't want to take up anymore of your time
Time, time, time

Sometimes time doesn't heal
No, not at all
It just stands still
While we fall
In or out of love, again I doubt
I'm gonna win you back
When you've got eyes like that
That won't let me in
Always looking out

Always looking

Always looking out

Always looking out

Always looking out
