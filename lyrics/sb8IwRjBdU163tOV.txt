I do it
I do it
I do it (I like that)
Boy
Boy (Fuck your time nigga)
I do it

I waited my whole life to be the man of the hour
Really can't lie, I was the man when I started
I will be the man when I die
Man these hoes, take your money
And I take their virginity
I'm high, I split an O in half, now it's a parenthesis
Crazier than crazy, ape shit, retardedly stupid
I put that weed in an uhh and pass it
Yep that's ally oopin, okay
Oh, that's your girl
Well I don't give a master two shits
Okay I'm westside, westside till I'm riding underneath them tulips
You bordo like Enrique, I'm toupee, I'm three-pee
I'm looking like I'mma sweep stakes
But I treat ya girl like a cheap skate
Cause I need a crib, a big estate
I need a boat and that need a lake
I need some salmon, that need a plate
That need a chef so I feed my safe
My crew is who I'd be widdy-be-wid-it
Rose I sippity-sip-it
I'm Quagmire I fuck hoes
My cashflow I giggity-giggity it
Boy, I'm cock-a-mania
The most zaniest, insaniant
Pulling up in Merced-iance
Rolling up like I'm Damian
I love girls that Arabian, Albanian, caucasian
I ride around gettin cranium cause my dick is hard as titanium
Oh boy you had your chance, and blew it (you blew it)
Stand aside and watch a real nigga do it

I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
Boy
Boy
Boy
Boy
Boy
Boy
Boy
Boy

I feel like (I do it)the World mine (I do it)
Just bow down (I do it), the world mine (I do it)
I'mma let you live (I do it), the World mine (I do it)
This world mine (I do it)

The one and only in this muthafucker
Niggas staring like we the only ones in this muthafucker
How could you not know we in this muthafucker
I got my haters looking lonely in this muthafucker
Woah, I'm sipping on whatever I get handed
Throwing house parties so crazy that my crib look like a campus
Play your cards right and I could blow you up
Nah, I ain't Gambit shit, I'm wasted, wasted
This looks like a job for Captain Planet
Nah, nah, good lordy, wowdy, I just took more shot than Kobe
The realest niggas is reppin
The baddest bitches promoting
She put that thong on my groin groin
And then it go boing!
Got my fronter on her bumper does it look like she towing
I hustle hard like I'm finna lose the crib
And party hard like I'm finna do it big
All I ever do is big
So all she wanna do is big
Girl, what your name is, I really can't remember
And tone breaking tree down, somebody yell out timber
I'm up up in them Kush clouds, lighting up like I'm Zeus
Bitch stand back watch how a real nigga do it

I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
Boy
Boy
Boy
Boy
Boy
Boy

I feel like (I do it)the World mine (I do it)
Just bow down (I do it), the world mine (I do it)
I'mma let you live (I do it), the World mine (I do it)
This world mine (I do it)

Boy
