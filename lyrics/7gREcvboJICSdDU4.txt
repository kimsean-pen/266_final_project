Everything is clear in the rear view mirror
The coast highway and the golden hour
Only love
Nothing was lost

Everything fits when you tell your story
The blurry portraits in the halls of former
Lovers
Gone
But nothing was lost

You'll always be a part of me
You gave me a song to sing
Dancing in your room
Innocent and true
Elvis tattoo on your shoulder
We'll know better when we're older

You'll always be a part of me
Some wounds will always sting
Forever in full bloom
Barely twenty two
Summer days are growing colder
We'll know better when we're older

All of this was planned when the world was Started
The red blood hearts
The final word was never said
I'm tossing in my bed

But everything is clear in the rear view mirror
When nothing is left
The lights of evening round us shine pink and Silver skies

You'll always be a part of me
You gave me a song to sing
Dancing in your room
Innocent and true
Elvis tattoo on your shoulder
We'll know better when we're older

You'll always be a part of me
Some wounds will always sting
Forever in full bloom
Barely twenty two
Summer days are growing colder
We'll know better when we're older
