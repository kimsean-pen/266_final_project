They're lying
This the greatest story ever told
They're dying
To keep us away from the secrets they all hold
This is disgusting
They keep the human race in check and they do what they're told
We are realising
There are some questions that can't be awnsered or be told

What you believe is your religion
What you recieve is what you're given
Don't need anyone from above
To to tell me what to do
I'm gonna do what i'm gonna do

To to tell me what to do
I'm gonna do what i'm gonna do

What is that you can't find
Feeling emptiness inside
Going on adressing something
That you say that I would hide
