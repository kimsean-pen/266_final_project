Loss of Vision
Brain Contusion
Sight and short of Breath
Heartbeat pounding, Pulse is slowing
Light has turned to Black
Excruciating Agony
Have you lost your Will to Live?
Perpetuating Destiny
It's in your Hands to give
Staring at the Crypts of Death
Certain Mortal Perishment
There is no will to give
Existence has reached its End
There is no Perplexity
End of Life's expectancy
Stripped of Life's Vitality
Certain Death
Pressure building inside your Head
Compression pushing to the Red
Limbs are Numb, Control is Lost
Bag of Blood is about to Bust
Searching for the Strength to Grasp
Your Life Span is Flashing Fast
Now your Time has come to Pass
Thickening Blood will now Delay
Pulse has quickened, but too Late
Melting Braincells Die away
Cranium dripping, oozing Gray
Ever lasting Intensity
Perpetuating Destiny
Excruciating Agony
Certain Death
Covered in Gore by Butchery
Constant flowing Ecstasy
Grasping Life
You feel it slip
Death awaits you at the Crypts
There is no Perplexity
End of Life's Expectancy
Stripped of Life's Vitality
Certain Death
