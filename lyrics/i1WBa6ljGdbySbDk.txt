I left Howse without a fucking clue
And left New York City, girl, without you
But the sun does shine in this place some days
And even when there's clouds there isn't always rain
I'll stow away my grays
In a padlocked case in a padlocked room
Only to be realeased, when I sing all the songs I wrote about you
This is the last one i'll do

Now I'm free in parentheses
And I'm not sure what I ought to do with it
It sits in the house bright eyes and raised hand
If I ignore its advances then the hand goes down

I'll stow away my greys
In a padlocked case in a padlocked room
Only to be relased
When I sing all the songs I wrote about you
This is the last one I'll do

I feel better and better and worse and then better
Than ever, than ever, than ever
I feel much better, and better, and worse and then better
Then ever, then ever, then ever, then ever

I'll stow away my greys
In a padlocked case in a padlock room
Only to be relased
When I see you walking around with someone new
This is the last song, this is the last song,
This is the last song I'll write about you
