Uh, it's time to be lettin' go
A change is gonna come, you know
Switch up to this new from old
This is where I take control
Uh, yeah
All the leaves on the trees turn to gold
They fall so you can grow
You and me, we were greener than most
We gotta let the seasons flow
So boy, let the seasons flow
It's natural
Why are we still holdin' on?
Love comes and goes
I don't feel the same no more
It's been and gone
So why are we holding on?
Love comes and goes
Yeah, oh
I swear the time we spent together
You turned cold, uh
I tried to offer you a sweater
But you said no
And throughout this stormy weather
There's a side to you I don't know
As the sweetness does the bitter
The truth about you unfolds
As the dreams we believed fade away
The cycle starts again
You and me, we weren't made for the rain
We gotta let the seasons change
So boy, let the seasons flow
It's natural
Why are we still holdin' on?
Love comes and goes
I don't feel the same no more
It's been and gone
So why are we holding on?
Love comes and goes
Yeah, yeah
I run with the flow, with the wind
Walk on the park [?]
Listen to the birds when they sing
Once our roads crossed
But we got so lost
Now I'm onto new things
Playin' with my instincts
It seems that we're different
And it's time to go
So boy, let the seasons flow
It's natural
Why are we still holdin' on?
Love comes and goes
I don't feel the same no more
It's been and gone
So why are we holding on? (Hold on, yeah)
Love comes and goes
So boy, let the seasons flow
It's natural (let it flow)
Why are we still holdin' on? (Oh)
Love comes and goes (let it go)
I don't feel the same no more
It's been and gone (oh no, no, no, no, no)
So why are we holding on?
Love comes and goes
