Words are flowing out
Like endless rain
Into a paper cup
They slither wildly
As they slip away
Across the universe

Pools of sorrow
Waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai Guru Deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light
Which dance before me
Like a million eyes
They call me on and on
Across the universe

Thoughts meander
Like a restless wind
Inside a letter box
They tumble blindly
As they make their way
Across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter
Shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless, undying love
Which shines around me
Like a million suns
It calls me on and on
Across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
