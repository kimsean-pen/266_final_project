The sounds cemented down
Circus on repeating clouds
Just over and over, a crown
of repeating sounds

Time to make the ugly lovely
Time to make the lovely ugly

SO I'M LEAVING

Stopped in a lesson, shot down
Sirens are ringing all around
Time to make the indecisive
Then time will turn me into nothing

SO I'M LEAVING
I'M LEAVING
I'M LEAVING
I'M LEAVING

So I'm leaving
I'm leaving
I'm leaving
I'm leaving
So I'm leaving
I'm leaving
