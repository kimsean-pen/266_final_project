Heat on your face,
The comforting sun.
I need it to warm me,
Taste it on my tongue.

There's a color or a shade, revealing
Lighting up your face, shine on me, shine on me.

Heat on your face,
You know they're calling it off again.
And I thought I heard you
Sitting up there in the clouds.
You know I'm fading out
And that's fine,
Just shine right on me.

There's a color or a shade, revealing
Lighting up your face, shine on me, shine on me.

There's a color or a shade, revealing
Lighting up your face, shine on me, shine on me.

Enemy, Enemy,
You're my only enemy,
And you're only steadying my pain.

Call on me, call on me,
Help me wash away the shame.
There's a blood red dirty stain, away.

You say "It's okay"
But you always let it rain,
Yeah you always let it rain anyway.

Only me, only me,
And you always let it rain,
Yeah you always let it rain anyway.
