I'm feeling you, can you feel it too?
I want you
Was missing you
Now I'm wishing I never knew your name

Drawn out, you're losing me now at your fingertips
Keep me lingering for weeks
Call it heartless attraction, at best

Well of course you're gonna call out my name
And watch my heart crawl up your sleeve
I let go and loosen my grip
From your fingertips
And quietly collapse into the pavement

I'm feeling you, can you feel it too?
I want you
Was missing you
Now I'm wishing I never knew your name
I'm feeling you, can you feel it too?
I want you
But I left it all back there, love

Bleach blonde, brunette
Reaching for clarity
She accidentally
Disappears, in impulsive devotion at best

And of course you're gonna call out my name
Your love, love, love dressed up in black
Why don't you let go and loosen your grip
From my fingertips
And carefully collapse your entertainment?

I'm feeling you, can you feel it too?
I want you
Was missing you
Now I'm wishing I never knew your name
I'm feeling you, can you feel it too?
I want you
But I left it all back there, love
But I left it all back there, love

I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be where you are
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be where you are
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be where you are
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be where you are
Where you are
Where you are
Where you are

I'm feeling you, can you feel it too?
I want you
Was missing you
Now I'm wishing I never knew your name
I'm feeling you, can you feel it too?
I want you
But I left it all back there, love

But I left it all back there, love
I left it all back there, love
