Not 'til you halo all over me
I'll come over

Not 'til it shimmers 'round your skull
I'll be yours
I weave for you
The marvellous web

Glow in the dark threads
All Neon Like
The cocoon surrounds you
Embraces all

So you can sleep
Foetus-style

And they will assist us
'Cause we're asking for help
And the luminous beam
It feeds you

Henh-yeah!, henh-yeah
The soft distortion
Fills you up
Nourish nourish

Your turtleheart
And they will assist us

'Cause we're asking for help
And the luminous beam
It feeds you
Henh-yeah!, yeah!

Don't get angry with yourself
Don't, don't get angry with yourself
I'll heal you
With a razorblade
I'll cut a slit open
And the luminous beam
Feeds you honey, heals you
Don't get angry with yourself
I'll heal you, i'll heal you
luminous, i'll heal you
