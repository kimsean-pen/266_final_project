We were dealing with the devil,
making promises that never lasted.
Holding on to eachother.
Yeah.
We were sipping on emotions
and the more we drank
the more we felt it.

Oh, the more we get tired of the same old songs.
The same old songs.
Yeah.
Oh, the light that
we're supposed to feel in
everything between.
Don't you wish?
Ey-yeah.

If we knew what we did
back in ninety nine.
If we knew what we've done,
it's a sign of the times.
Not knowing.
(Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)
Not knowing who we are.
(Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)
Not knowing what we feel.
(Whistle note)

We ain't nothing at the surface,
with our eyes closed
and our hearts shut.
Turn away from the truth.
Nah.
And I know that it's hard sometimes. (Yeah)

Oh, the more we get tired
of the same old songs.
The same old songs.
(Mmm) (yeah)
The light that we're supposed to
feel in everything between. (Mmm)
Don't you wish, no oh!

If we knew what we did
back in ninety nine.
If we knew what we've done,
it's a sign of the times.
Not knowing. (Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)
Not knowing who we are.
Not knowing. (Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)
Not knowing what we feel.

If we knew what we did
back in ninety nine.
If we knew what we've done,
it's a sign of the times.
Not knowing. (Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)
Not knowing who we are.
Not knowing. (Ooh-ooh-oh-oh)
Not knowing what we feel.

Not knowing.
Not knowing.
Not knowing.
Not knowing.

Not knowing-knowing-knowing.
Not knowing-knowing-knowing.
Not knowing-knowing-knowing.
Not knowing.
(Whistle note)

(If we knew what we did
back in ninety nine.)
(Knew what we've done)
(Sign of the times)
(If we knew what we did
back in ninety nine.)
(Knew what we've done)
(Sign of the times)
