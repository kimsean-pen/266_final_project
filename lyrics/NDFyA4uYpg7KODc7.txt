In enemies hands I don't have to measure
I don't have to measure
In enemies hands I don't have to measure
I don't have to measure up

And I've seen a million miles at once, staring as once
You are the apple of my life
There's no one but you in the world I'd choose
You are what carries dark to light
There is no excuse for being untrue

In every sound is an above and below unfound
The dance they do we all feel
Above and below sensory input are two lovers disconnected by us

So we have to join them in our actions
We are the center of what one wants

You are the apple of my life
There's no one but you in the world I'd choose
You are the sum and whole of life
There is no one in the world but you and I
You connect the earth to the sky

And nothing comes between us
Our bodies or minds
Nothing disconnects us
Nor silence or time
