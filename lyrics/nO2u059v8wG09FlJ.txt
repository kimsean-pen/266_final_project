Enjoy your time alone
The older you get the harder it is to find
Feet are worn down to the bone
I call you up to tell you what's on my mind

Six, seven, two hours from now
I'll find a way somewhere somehow
What is it to you?
What's in it for me?
I've earned the right to be selfish
Don't you agree?
Climbing up the hill
Dont know what I'll see
Something tells me
You miss me
Six, seven, two hours from now
I'll find a way somewhere somehow

I'm at loss for words
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
Just don't believe everything you've heard

Six, seven, two hours from now
I'll find a way somewhere somehow
What is it to you?
What's in it for me?
I've earned the right to be selfish
Don't you agree?
Climbing up the hill
Dont know what I'll see
Something tells me
You miss me
Six, seven, two hours from now
I'll find a way somewhere somehow
