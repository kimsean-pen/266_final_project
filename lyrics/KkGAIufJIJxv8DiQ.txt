Oppose the flow, or take the role,
They're only asking for your body and soul
And your mind is not your own
Until you comprehend their forms of control

All the underdogs, black sheep,
Fighters of the powers that be
In tenements, high rises,
Freedom fighters, the outsiders

'Cos some of us are healing,
And some of us are feeding a pain,
We just need to speak it
So we can proceed again,

Hey sister, don't let your heart close its fist yeah
You got to, get up up be a resister
You got to, get up up be a resister

Sometimes it's too much you know
And now I know they've got you feeling down low
But there's just one way to dig ourselves from this hole
'Cos true change only comes from below

Breeze riders, occupiers, residing
In otherwise sidelined quarters,
On doorways, on corners, and borders

'Cos some of us are healing,
And some of us are feeding a pain,
And we just need to speak it
So we can proceed again,

Hey sister, don't let your heart close its fist yeah
You got to, get up up be a resister
You got to, get up up be a resister
Hey sister, don't let your heart close its fist yeah
You got to, get up up be a resister
You got to, get up up be a resister

The slackers, the sleepless, the homeless, the loners
Sex workers with a service, street workers risking murder
On council estates reclaiming space, from ethical leaders
And we just need to speak it so we can proceed again

Hey sister, don't let your heart close its fist yeah
You got to, get up up be a resister
You got to, get up up be a resister
Hey sister, don't let your heart close its fist yeah
You got to, get up up be a resister
You got to, get up up be a resister
