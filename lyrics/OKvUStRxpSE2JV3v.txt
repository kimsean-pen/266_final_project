Some nights you feel cursed
And the music will only make it worse
Some nights you feel free
Close your eyes and count to three
Tonight, our feet are moving to a different beat
It's alright
I've always liked my romance bittersweet
It's what I need

Some girls wanna dance in the spotlight
Some girls just kiss and tell
Some girls wanna movie moment
Waiting by the wishing well
Don't need to make you love me
I got myself and I want to make music
To make the boys cry
Make the boys cry, make the boys cry

I like when it rains
And the thunder is running through my veins
I wanna switch off stars
I've always liked it better in the dark
And tonight I feel like diving and going deep
It's alright
I've always liked my romance bittersweet
It's what I need

Some girls wanna dance in the spotlight
Some girls just kiss and tell
Some girls wanna movie moment
Waiting by the wishing well
Don't need to make you love me
I got myself and I want to make music
To make the boys cry
Make the boys cry, make the boys cry
I want to make music to make the boys cry...

Right now
There's a change in the room
Can you feel it?
Right now
There's an epic story
Right now
I can see you
why you came here tonight?
Right now
I don't know why I'm walking away

Yeah, yeah

I, I, I want to make music to make the boys cry...

Some girls wanna dance in the spotlight
Some girls just kiss and tell
Some girls wanna movie moment
Waiting by the wishing well
Don't need to make you love me
I got myself and I want to make music
To make the boys cry

Some girls wanna dance in the spotlight
Some girls just kiss and tell
Some girls wanna movie moment
Waiting by the wishing well
Don't need to make you love me
I got myself and I want to make music
To make the boys cry
Make the boys cry, make the boys cry

I want to make music to make the boys cry...
Make the boys cry, make the boys cry
I want to make music to make the boys cry...
