Mortuaries, dead of night, my body starts to rise
In my mind the horror lives to feel death deep inside
Relentless lust of rotting flesh to thrash the tomb she lies
Heathen whore of Satan's wrath, I spit at your demise

Virgin child now drained of life, your soul cannot be free
Not given the chance to rot in Hell

Satan's cross points to Hell, the Earth I must uncover
A passion grows to feast upon the frozen blood inside her
I feel the urge, the growing need to fuck this sinful corpse
My task is complete, the bitch's soul lies raped in demonic lust

Her stomach bursts the casket breaks, the seed has taken form
A writhing shape of twisted flesh, the Devil's child is thrown
Hungry for the smell of death, he rules forbidden evil
Vengeance with a frenzied hatred, the bastard now must die

Lost souls of the dead form legions that burst through Hell's Gates
Death of one sacrifice to avenge the raped corpse from the grave
Blood of one mortal man, the fire grows stronger within
Fate of a frenzied lust, Lucifer takes my dark soul

Down to the fiery pits of Hell
Down to the fiery pits of Hell
