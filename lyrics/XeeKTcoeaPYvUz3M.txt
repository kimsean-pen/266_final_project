The desk where you sit inside of a
frame made of, made of, of wood
I keep those chopsticks you had from when
you taught abroad, taught abroad, in Japan

I love it all so much
I call
I want you back, back, back
You back

I did not know you as well
as my father, father knew you
Every question you took the
time to sit and look it up,
look it up in the encyclopedia

I love it all
So much I call
I want you back, back, back
You back

I love it all
So much I call
I want you back, back, back
You back

Da da daaa ay

It sounds like we
would have had a great deal to say, to say
to each other
I bet when I leave
my body for the sky the wait,
the wait will be worth it

I love it all
So much I call
I want you back, back, back
You back

I love it all
So much I call
I want you back, back, back
You back
