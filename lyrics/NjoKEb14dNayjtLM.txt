Your bobby pinned your auburn back
As we crossed over the Washington state line
In my grandfather's car
We were fleeing the scene of a California coastline
Where we buried our dreams among the gridlock and concrete

Barefoot we pulled around and stepped into the sunlight
Then we drank greedily of greenery and open air

This was not the time or place
To address the emptiness that hung around us
Or how the end of this trip
Burnt us with uncertainty of what to do next
