It's so clear
Can't hide my pride when I have you near
It's no surprise love has knocked me down
'Cause I saw heaven in your eyes
It's so cleae
Can't hide my pride when I have you near
It's no surprise love has knocked me down
'Cause I saw heaven in your eyes

It's so strong
Can't help myself when I feel it's wrong

Something inside me says "Take a chance"

Want to try on this romance

No matter we're from worlds apart

Who said that we would get this far
It's so platonic but it's true
I just keep on falling

I keep on falling for you
I keep on falling in love with you
Can you make this feeling last forever?
All you gotta do is say you feel it too
I keep on falling for you
I keep on falling in love with you
Can't you see that we belong together?
All you gotta do is say you feel it too
It's so clear
Can't hide my pride when I have you near
