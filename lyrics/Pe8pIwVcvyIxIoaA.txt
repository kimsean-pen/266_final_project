his tires start spinning, rock and roll starts winning
we rise to the top, we're the cream of the crop
we make with the hair cuts straight outta the past
we blast first, we blast last

teenage caveman rock with skin and bone
it's the cry of the wild, we cry alone
we cry alone, we cry alone

we cry alone, we cry alone

got a strand of barbed wire stwied around my throat
teenage caveman blind and without any hope
let's get primitive right now, down with the rocks and the dirt
let's bang our heads girl, trade spit 'til it hurts

teenage caveman rock with skin and bone
it's the cry of the wild, we cry alone
we cry alone, we cry alone

woke to the sound of an angel, rolling close to the door
i can hear the flowers bloom the dust and something roar

teenage caveman rock with skin and bone
it's the cry of the wild, we cry alone
we cry alone, we cry alone
