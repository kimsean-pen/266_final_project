Don't let it go
You're slipping through my hands

You are the coward
You'll never find it, if you don't sacrifice yourself for this
Do you realize how many times you lost it?
Not so sure, it aways comes back to you

You can say that easily (easily!)
But that doesn't make any sense
Did you ever wonder why it stays with you?
Even though it's got sick and tired of your words

(Can you see me?)
(Can you feel me?)
(Can you hear me?)

I scream cause it's not (meant to be!)
Don't take away from me!

Your existence is shattering, like a broken glass
Bring it back, bring it back to me again
Bring it back, bring it back to me again
Bring it back to me

I'm trying to hold you back
But you're slipping through my hands

I scream your name, to take back those days
They will never come back
The memories got faint
I'm afraid to lose you again
You're slipping through my hands

(I'll never let you go!)
This time we won't fall down
(I'll never let you go!)
I'll never let you go

(Can you see me?)
(Can you feel me?)
(Can you hear me?)

I scream cause it's not (meant to be!)
Don't take away from me

Getting down to my kness and pray to God
Bring it back, bring it back to me again
Now bring it back

Can you see me?
Can you feel me?

(Can you see me?)
(Can you feel me?)
(Can you hear me?)

I scream cause it's not (meant to be!)
Don't take away from me

I'll never let you go!
I'll never let you go!
I'll never let you go!
I'll never let you go!

(I'll never let you go!)
I'll never let you go!
