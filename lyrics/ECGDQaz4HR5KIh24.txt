All the other girls here are stars
You are the northern lights
They try to shine in through your curtain
You're too close and too bright
They try and they try
But everything that they do
Is the ghost of a trace
Of a pale imitation of you
I'll be the one to
Drive you back home Kathleen

This party was made with the night air
And the chance that a smile
Will wind its way from your face
To one of the boys in your line
You act like you're hip to their tricks
And you're strong
But a virgin Wurlitzer heart
Never once had a song
I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen

And I'll have you back by break of day
I'm going your way anyway
And if you'd like to come along
I'll be yours for a song

I know you are waiting
And I know that it is not for me
But I'm here and I'm ready
And I've saved you the passenger seat
I won't be your last dance
Just your last goodnight
Every heart is a package tangled up in knots
Someone else tied
I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen

Comin' round the bend
Oh, comin' round the bend

So crawl up your trellis
And quietly back into your room
And I'll coast down the length of your drive
By the light of the moon
And the next time we meet's
A new kind of hello
Both our hearts have a secret
Only both of us know
'Bout the night that I
Drove you back home Kathleen
