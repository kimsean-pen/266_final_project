Well somebody told me
That I would be a dreamer for life
Somebody told me
I would never reach the other side

Well you say I'm old news
But cross your fingers; I'm yours to lose
What if I told you
That things will never improve?

And if I lived a lie
Would someone meet me on the other side
So I could burn out bright?
So I can burn, so I can burn

The grass is always greener
Someone else's past is always cleaner
But I'm a believer
but there's a fool in all of us

And if I lived a lie
Would someone meet me on the other side
So I could burn out bright?

Oh, I don't really know where our ghosts go
No, I don't really know where our ghosts go
So live a lie, just tonight, tonight

We are believers
we are believers
We are believers
we are believers
We are believers
we are believers
We are believers
we are believers

We are believers
we are believers
We are believers
we are believers
We are believers
we are believers
We are, we are

And if I lived a lie
Would someone meet me on the other side
So I could burn out bright?
And if I lived a lie
Would someone meet me on the other side
So I could burn out bright?
Oh, I don't really know where our ghosts go
No, I don't really know where our ghosts go
So live a lie, just tonight
And burn out bright
