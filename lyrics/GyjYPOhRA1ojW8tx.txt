What if Martin didn't stand up?
What if Rosa didn't sit down? (Sit down, sit down)
What if Malcom didn't man up?
Where would we be now? (Where would we be now?)

What if Marley didn't get up stand up?
What if Dubois didn't come to advance us?
And Mandela didn't come to teach us
Where would we be now?

We are the ones we been waiting for
We can change the world
We can change the world

With our love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
'Cause it's up to us
We are the ones we been waiting for
We can change the world
Our love can change the world
We can change the world
With our love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Our love can change the world

What if Maya didn't speak out?
What if Langston Hughes didn't write it down?
What if Josephine Braker didn't dance it out? (No)
Tell me where would we be now? (Where would we be now?)

What if Sojourner never told the truth?
Or Ida B Wells never printed the news
Harriet never went underground
Where would we be now

We are the ones we been waitin' for
We can change the world
We can change the world
With our love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

'Cause it's up to us
We are the ones we been waiting for
We can change the world
Our love can change the world
We can change the world
With our love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Our love can change the world

Me too, I matter, you matter, we matter
Together we are love
Me too, I matter, you matter, we matter
Together we are love
It's gotta be all of us
To standup and speak out
With all of our love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
'Cause it up to us

We are the ones we been waiting for
We can change the world
Our love can change the world
We will change the world
With our love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Our love can change the world
