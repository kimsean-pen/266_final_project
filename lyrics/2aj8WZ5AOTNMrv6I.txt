She turned away
What was she looking at?
She was a sour girl
The day that she met me
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl
The day that she left me
She turned away
What was she looking at?
She was a sour girl
The day that she met me
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl
When she left me
What would you do?
What would you do
If I followed you?
What would you do
If I follow?
Don't turn away
What are you looking at?
He was so happy on
The day that he met her
Say, what are you looking at?
I was a superman
But looks are deceiving
The rollercoaster
Rides a lonely one
I paid a ransom note
To stop it from steaming
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a teenage
Girl when she met me
What would you do?
What would you do
If I followed you?
What would you do
If I follow?
What would you do?
(What would you do?)
What would you do
If I followed you?
What would you do
If I follow?
The girl got reasons
They all got reasons
What would you do?
(What would you do?)
What would you do
If I followed you?
What would you do
If I follow?
What would you do?
(What would you do?)
What would you do
If I followed you?
What would you do
If I follow?
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl
The day that she left me
The day that she left me
The day that she left me
She was a happy girl
The day that she left me
She was a sour girl
The day that she met
The day that she left me
