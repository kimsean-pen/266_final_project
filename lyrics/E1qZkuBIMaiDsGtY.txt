Your sweet insanity is whispering in my ears
And you speak of honesty by lying to yourself

So tell me, do you know any more good stories?
Which role should I play?
And I can be the least of all of your worries
How often can you say

Believe me, I'm so sorry
But the truth is, I'm not a part of your story

My world is incomplete
And you've been filling in the gaps with lies
And we're all just characters
You've written between the lines

So tell me, do you know any more good stories?
Which role should I play?
And I can be the least of all of your worries
How often can you say

Believe me, I'm so sorry
But the truth is, I'm not a part of your fucking story

My world is incomplete
Where I've fallen at your feet
My world is incomplete
While you get back on your feet

Hanging from this framework of good stories
And making your own moral categories
However, the wreckage that you leave
I've proven to myself that I am very naive

I just didn't wanna know
The large gift of your narrative skill
More than anything I get to know
I get to know that words can kill
Hanging from this framework of good stories
Of double meanings and parallel worlds
Against a wall where souls are hurled
My world is incomplete, how often can you say

Believe me, I'm so sorry
But the truth is, I'm not a part of your story

My world is incomplete
Where I've fallen at your feet
My world is incomplete
While you get back on your feet
