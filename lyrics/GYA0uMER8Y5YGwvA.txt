This is your life
The clock ticks
Never truly free until you've lost everything
Our great war is a spiritual war
Our great depression is our lives

The middle children of history
No purpose or place
Always perfect but incomplete
This life

Broken
My fight, my night
Notice
My self-destruction
Breathe in
I've found the answer
Broken
I've got this, I've got this

You met me at a pivotal time
Walking the line, a witness to crime
So brace for the flood
And let me taste the blood
Devastation in a moment of release
Break my limbs
Wash it clean and do it again

Take a shot, make it clean
Put the barrel between my teeth
Overthrow apathy
All I want is to feel something
This is all that I need
Fracture everything in me

Broken
My fight, my night
Notice
My self-destruction
Breathe in
I've found the answer
Broken
I've got this, I've got this
I've got this

I've found the answer, I've found the answer
I've found the answer, I've found the answer

I've found the answer, I've found the answer

My self-destruction (My self-destruction)
My self-destruction (My self-destruction)
My self-destruction (My self-destruction)
My self-destruction
