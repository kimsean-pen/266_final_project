The family's head gives orders
In the end, what he says goes
This system's well constructed
She owes him all she gets

The army has it's uses
In times of civil crisis
'Allo boys! Seen any action?
Hey boys, seen any... action?

Pull together with your mates
Against the common enemy
The Private's not born that way

The Private's not born that way
Guns take up all his time
With no job he'd be in a mess
Wanted action, gets some in

She pays him back in the bedroom
One step down from her leader
Obeys, or is punished
Like he obeys his bosses
