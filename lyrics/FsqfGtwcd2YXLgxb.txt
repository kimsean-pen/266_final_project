My baby's got a heart of stone.
Can't you people just leave her alone?
She never did nothing to hurt you,
So just leave her alone.

The motion of her tiny hands and the quiver of her bones below
Are the signs of a girl alone, and tell you everything you need to know.
I can't explain it, I feel it often everytime I see her face...
But the way you treat her fills me with rage, and I want to tear apart the place.

You try to tell her what to do, and all she does is stare at you.
Her stare is louder than your voice because truth doesn't make a noise.
No, truth doesn't make a noise, the truth doesn't make a noise.

I can't explain it, I feel it often everytime I see her face...
But the way you treat her fills me with rage, and I want to tear apart the place.
