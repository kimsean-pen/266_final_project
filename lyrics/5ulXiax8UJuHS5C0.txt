When it's time to party, we will party hard

You, you work all night
And when you're workin', you don't feel all right
And when, when things stop feelin' all right (all right)
Then everything is all right

'Cause we will never listen to your rules (No!)
We will never do as others do (No!)
Know what we want and we get it from you
Do what we like and we like what we do

So, let's get a party goin'
(Let's get a party goin')
Now it's time to party and we'll party hard
(Party hard!)

Let's get a party goin'
(Let's get a party goin')
When it's time to party
We will always party hard

(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)

Hey
Hey
Hey

All right
You, you fight that fight
And when you're fightin', you feel all right
But when, when things start feeling all right (all right)
Then everything is all right

'Cause we will never listen to your rules (No!)
We will never do as others do (No!)
Know what we want and we get it from you
We do what we like and we like what we do

So, let's get a party goin'
(Let's get a party goin')
Now it's time to party and we'll party hard
(Party hard!)

Let's get a party goin'
(Let's get a party goin')
When it's time to party
We will always party hard

(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
(Party hard!)
Hey
