And now I'm stuck in the sound
Can't keep my feet on the ground, on the ground
You've got me turning around, and around, and around

And now I'm stuck in the sound (Stuck in the sound)
Can't keep my feet on the ground, on the ground (On the ground)
You've got me turning around, and around, and around

And now I'm stuck in the sound (Stuck in the sound)
Can't keep my feet on the ground, on the ground (On the ground)
You've got me turning around, and around, and around

And now I'm stuck in the sound
Can't keep my feet on the ground, on the ground
You've got me turning around, and around, and around

And now I'm stuck in the sound
Can't keep my feet on the ground, on the ground
You've got me turning around
You've got me turning around, and around, and around
And around, and around, and around, and around

You've got me turning around
You've got me turning around
You've got me turning around, and around, and around
