I, I've suffered long enough in this ghost town
I saw the walls, called their bluff and took them down

When I think of all the time I've wasted
All the bitter pills I've tasted
I have to hang my head and frown
I, I've suffered long enough in this ghost town

Soon came a day under skies that were gray
When I knew I couldn't stay in this ghost town full of
Clones and clowns and carbon copy towns, with
Kine and swine and nothing that was mine,
And this town's decline with my hatred intertwined,
So I gather all I find and I bolted it to me,
Fueled my fires and I grabbed my pliers, and I'm lit!

I made my own machine
Yes, we're building steam
I hate the same routine.

I made my own machine
Yes, we're building steam
I hate the same routine.

I, I never looked back--I want to never return
If I could find a fuse, those bridges would burn

But I keep this horse at a run
Keep my hand to my gun
My path the vampires have learned.
So I, I can never look back; I can never return.

Soon came a day under skies that were gray
When I knew I couldn't stay in this ghost town full of
Clones and clowns and carbon copy towns, with
Kine and swine and nothing that was mine,
And this town's decline with my hatred intertwined,
So I gather all I find and I bolted it to me,
Fueled my fires and I grabbed my pliers, and I'm lit!

I made my own machine
Yes, we're building steam
I hate the same routine
