I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station, gonna buy a ticket to ride
Gonna find that lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat

Sing this song for the people I meet
And get along with it all
Go where the people say "y'all"
Sing a song with a friend

Change the shape that I'm in,
And get back in the game,
And start playin' again
I'd like to stay but I might have to go to start over again

I might go back down to Texas,
Might go to somewhere that I've never been
And get up in the mornin' and go out at night
And I won't have to go home

Get used to bein' alone
Change the words to this song
And start singin' again

I'm tired of runnin' 'round lookin' for
Answers to questions that I already know
I could build me a castle with memories just to have somewhere to go
Count the days and the nights that it

Takes to get back in the saddle again
Feed the pigeons some clay
Turn the night into day
And start talkin' again, when I know what to say

I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station, gonna buy a ticket to ride
Gonna find that lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat

Sing my song for the people I meet
And get along with it all
Where the people say "y'all"
Feed the pigeons some clay

Turn the night into day
Start talkin' again
When I know what to say
