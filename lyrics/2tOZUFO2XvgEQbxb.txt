Scared to death of everybody
The secrets we never buried
I've been trying for days
Just to keep you alive
Can you keep me alive?

Malevolent love broke my will
When I needed help, suffering to feel
Malevolent love broke my will
When I needed help, suffering to feel

Are you the curse I've chosen
Tangled up in me?
Like the world we lost
Now watch me cease to be

Malevolent love broke my will
When I needed help, suffering to feel
Malevolent love broke my will
When I needed help, suffering to feel

I'm suffering to feel
I'm suffering to feel
I'm suffering to feel
I'm suffering to feel

Malevolent love broke my will
When I needed help, suffering to feel
Malevolent love broke my will
When I needed help, suffering to feel
