You go and I'll be okay
I can dream the rest away
It's just a little touch of fate, it'll be okay
It sure takes its precious time, but it's got rights and so have I

I turn my head up to the sky
I focus one thought at a time
I do not let the little thieves under my tightly buttoned sleeve
It couldn't be a longer time, I feel like I am walking blind
I have no arrival time
There are no legible signs
There are no legible signs

I like the way that you talk
I like the way that you walk
It's hard to recreate such an individual gait

You wait your turn in the queue
You say your "Sorry"'s and "Thank you"'s
I don't think you're ever
A hundred percent in the room
You're not in the room
You're not in the room

Deepest of the dark nights
Here lies the highest of highs
Neopolitan Dreams, stretching out to the sea

You wait your turn in the queue
You say your "Sorry"s and "Thank you"s
I don't think you're ever
A hundred percent in the room
You're not in the room
You're not in the room
