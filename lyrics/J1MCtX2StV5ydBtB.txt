And then I found how to be what you want
I was out looking for something new
Digging too deep, now it's too late
We just keep on breaking the same old ground
Breaking the same old ground

So you think that I asked for this?
Let me show you what I think of your lips
And you think that I asked for this
Come on, use your fist

Then I found how to be what you want
When I was out looking for something new
Digging too deep, now it's too late
We just keep on breaking the same old ground
Breaking the same old ground
We just keep on breaking the same old ground

So you think that I asked for this?
Let me show you what I think of your lips
And you think that I asked for this
Come on, use your fist

When I found how to be what you want
I was out looking for something new
Digging too deep, now it's too late
We just keep on breaking the same old ground
Just keep on breaking the same old ground

Shh, shh

I am owned by death and I'm in love with oblivion
I am owned by death and I, and I'm in love with oblivion
