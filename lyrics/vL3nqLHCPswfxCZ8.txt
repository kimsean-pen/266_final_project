Drifting sideways
waves roar
lifted high enough up to see the shore and my friend
then the trough
and impenetrable sky
yawning sky

Asking questions
while night grows
with an ancient unknown that I carry around,
lost
then thunder replies
storming mind

Insignificant and billowing
a new storm
a new kind of roaring to tear through days
through the trees
through an opening light
yawning sky

Tossed on the waves
missing
from moment to moment being carried wherever
face pressed against
an impenetrable sky
yawning sky
