You called my name in the dark
Called me back to the start
The condensation is building tension

Stubborn silence is formed
Around our bodies it's warm
The cool wet grasses as summer passes

Frightened under attack
Fallen flat on my back
Arms and legs I'm too scared to beg

Harm me most when it's light
Thought of you don't sit right
I need the darkness a desperate embrace

Razing cities to dust
Faces dripping in lust
Fallen empires and raging bushfires

All your words confounded
Secret lives bound in bed
Living backwards and tangled back words

Ruined everything right
So good can't see the light
From my cave I can see the wave
Fallen empires and raging bushfires

We are the light
We are the light
We are the light
We are the light
We are the light
We are the light
We are the light
We are the light
We are the light
We are the light
We are the light
We are the light
We are the light...

(Run to the fire)
(Run to the fire)
(Run to the fire)
(Run to the fire)
(Run to the fire)
(Run to the fire)
