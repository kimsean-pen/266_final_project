The part that is envious, cold-hearted and devious
Greedy, mischievous, global, colonial
Bloodthirsty, blind, mindless and cheap
Focused on borders and slaughter and sheep
Burning of books, bulldozing of homes
Giving to targeted killing with drones
Lethal injections, arrest without trial
Monocular vision, gangrene and slime
Unction, sarcasm, common assault
Self satisfied heroic killers lifted on high
Piracy, avarice, acid attacks
On women by bullies and perverts and hacks
The rigging of ballots and the buying of power
Lies from the pulpit, rape in the shower
Mute, indifferent, feeling no shame
Portly, important, leering, deranged
Sat in the corner watching TV
Deaf to the cries of children in pain
Dead to the world, just watching the game
Watching endless repeats, out of sight, out of mind
Silence, indifference, the ultimate crime
But when I met you, that part of me died
Bring me a bowl to bathe her feet in
Bring me my final cigarette
It would be better by far to die in her arms then to linger
In a lifetime of regret
