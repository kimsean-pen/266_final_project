Cold light on summer days
Cold light the only way
Your light is always on
You know it's all gone wrong

You cry when things go wrong
You cry to tag along
You cry when things go wrong
Cold light is always on

You fight like you've given in
You fight like you've given in

We're uncovering your tracks
You know you cannot win
We're uncovering your tracks
You know you cannot win

Cold light on winter days
Lights up the mess you made
They're swarming down on you
Coming down to run you through

You cry when things go wrong
The whole world will tag along

You fight like you've given in
You fight like you've given in

We're uncovering your tracks
You know you cannot win
We're uncovering your tracks
You know you cannot win

You fight like you've given in
You fight like you've given in
(We're uncovering your tracks)
You fight like you've given in
You fight like you've given in
(We're uncovering your tracks)
You fight like you've given in

We're uncovering your tracks
You know you cannot win
We're uncovering your tracks
You know you cannot win
We're uncovering your tracks
You know you cannot win
We're uncovering your tracks
You know you cannot win
