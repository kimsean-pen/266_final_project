Am I dreaming
Walking in my sleep
I just can't drop this feeling underneath my feet
These London streets are moving
Rising up and meeting me
You know I see our faces eyes

I'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating
I'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating

Daily life feels like a constant dream
I keep on tripping out
Eyy, why am I such a freak?
I don't know why that painting's staring back at me
I swear, I think its eyes just moved

I'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating
I'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating

Baby, I'm scared to drink the water
Baby, I think you drank the water

A hallucination is a perception
In the absence of external stimulus
That has qualities of real perception
Hallucinations are vivid, substantial
And are perceived to be located in external objective space

I'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating
I'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating

I'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating
I'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating
