I've been staying up all night to kill the pain
You're the one to blame, it drives me insane

If you're seeking closure than I can help you dame
Despite what I may say, today is the day

I'll be knocking on the door
Keeping everything alright
Until the morning light
Is creeping in
If you have to have it

(2x)
(uh oh)You want it
(uh oh)You got it, tell me what you asked for
(uh oh)I'm waiting
(uh oh)You had me right-(uh oh)-here where you want me

Counting seconds, fading minutes, lasting hours
She is so sour, I taste her destain
If you were hoping, a joke can let you down
The crowd will scream aloud
THE KING HAS BEEN SLAIN!

I'll be knocking on the door
Keeping everything alright
Until the morning light
Is creeping in
If you have to have it

(2x)
(uh oh)You want it
(uh oh)You got it, tell me what you asked for
(uh oh)I'm waiting
(uh oh)You had me right-(uh oh)-here where you want me

I'll just wait here 'til I get my own way
Settle down and take a ride
If we're gonna empty the clip of this gun
I hope you intend on having good aim

I'll be knocking on the door
Keeping everything alright
until the morning light
Is creeping in
But if you have to have it

(2x)
(uh oh)You want it
(uh oh)You got it, tell me what you asked for
(uh oh)I'm waiting
(uh oh)You had me right-(uh oh)-here where you want me
