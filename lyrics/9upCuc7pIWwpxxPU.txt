I am on my own, and in a crowd of people, I feel disowned
Farewells are cold, and I drown in the rain that fills my soul
Talking to myself, pushing everyone away
They can't see it in my eyes, but I need them to stay

Some friends will depart, some stay the same
Some will fuel the anger, some heal the pain
Some will help me up, some tear me down
But what goes around comes around
Yeah, what goes around comes around
Yeah

I'm hard on myself, I need you to know
If I bottle it up any more, I'll explode
So you're sick of me too? Well, my friend get in line
'Cause I'm sick of myself, yeah, I'm sick of trying
Talking to myself is overcoming nothing
And the thought remains the same: is it all for nothing?"

Some friends will depart, some stay the same
Some will fuel the anger, some heal the pain
Some will help me up, some tear me down
But what goes around comes around
Some friends will depart, some stay the same
Some will fuel the anger, some heal the pain
Some will help me up, some tear me down
But what goes around comes around
But what goes around comes around

I always knew you'd turn your back on me
I always knew you'd turn your back on me

Talking to myself, pushing everyone away
They can't see it in my eyes
Talking to myself is overcoming nothing
And the thought remains the same: is it all for nothing?

Some friends will depart, some stay the same
Some will fuel the anger, some heal the pain
Some will help me up, some tear me down
But what goes around comes around
Some friends will depart, some stay the same
Some will fuel the anger, some heal the pain
Some will help me up, some tear me down
But what goes around comes around
