When there's clouds hangin' in your sky
And they're not just lettin' any light in
And you feel like you'd like to give in
Don't you give up so soon

What you need is a friend to count on
What you got, baby, you got someone
Who will stay when the rain is fallin'?
Won't let it fall on you

I'll see you through
I'll cover you with a love
So deep and warm and true
I will be there, oh

Honey I'll be your shelter
I'll be the one to take you through the night
Whenever you need shelter
I'll make everything alright, make everything alright, yeah

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

I got arms strong enough to hold you
Get you through anything you go through
Anything that you need
You know it's only a touch away

When your heart needs a heart beside it
Should be mine, that it's keeping time with
'Cause I got so much love inside it
Beats for you every day

I'll be the one
To give you love
When it seems like there's just not enough
Mine will be there, oh

Honey I'll be your shelter
I'll be the one to take you through the night
Whenever you need shelter
I'll make everything alright, make everything alright, yeah

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

I'll be your shelter
I'll be your shelter, baby

I'll see you through
I'll cover you with a love
So deep and warm and true
I will be there, oh

Honey, I'll be your shelter
I'll be the one to take you through the night
Whenever you need shelter
I'll make everything alright, make everything alright

Honey, I'll be your shelter
I'll be the one to take you through the night
Whenever you need shelter
I'll make everything alright, make everything alright, yeah

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
