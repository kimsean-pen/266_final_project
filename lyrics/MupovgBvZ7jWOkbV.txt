Has it come to this?
We're stuck in the weeds
I get it, I'm not perfect, I was never trying to be
But I'm not long for this earth
If we really only ever get once to burn
I gotta trip before I can see the finish
How else would I learn?
I wanna know, how is it you do it?

When you land on your feet
You're a nimble bastard
And you don't skip a beat
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
Such a nimble bastard
Yeah, won't you show, lowly us
How do you see the stars from that far down?

I swing and I miss
And then come the creeps
It makes me want to faint
I wanna know, how is it you do it?
How do you spill the paint?
And then fit it into a frame?

When you land on your feet
You're a nimble bastard
And you don't skip a beat
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
Such a nimble bastard
Yeah, won't you show, lowly us
How do you see the stars from that far down?

Has it come to this?
Has it come to this?

When you land on your feet
You're a nimble bastard
And you don't skip a beat
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
Look out
Won't you show, lowly us
How do you see the stars from that far down?
You're a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
You're such a nimble bastard
Yeah, won't you show, lowly us
How do you see the stars
