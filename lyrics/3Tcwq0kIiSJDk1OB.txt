Your mouth is dry,
The moon is shining.
The night is cold and lonely,
For you this must be frightening.

Send shivers down my spine.
There's something wrong in this head of mine.
Let's do it one more time.
You're never here in this bed of mine.

Give me one good reason why,
I should spare, spare you throat tonight.
Give me one good reason why,
I should give you, give you love tonight.

Body shaking. (Body shaking)
Darkness fading. (Darkness fading)
Yeah!

Can you please keep screaming,
Sceaming blood for me.

The sun is up,
I see things clearly.
Your bruises show so bluntly,
For me this must be tempting.

Send shivers down my spine.
There's something wrong in this head of mine.
Let's do it one more time.
You're never here in this bed of mine.

Give me one good reason why,
I should spare, spare you throat tonight.
Give me one good reason why,
I should give you, give you love tonight.

Body Shaking. (Body Shaking)
Darkness Fading (Darkness Fading)
Yeah!

One good reason,
Give me one good reason why.
One good reason,
Give me one good reason why.

Give me one good reason why,
I should spare, spare you throat tonight.
Give me one good reason why,
I should give you, give you love tonight.

Body shaking. (Body shaking)
Darkness fading. (Darkness fading)

Can you please keep screaming,
Sceaming blood for me.

There's something wrong in this head of mine.
