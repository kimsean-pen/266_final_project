Start!
Oh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

My silhouette is in the frame of your shades again
And your cigarette's facing its final breath
Just once or twice, is too many times when you know the end
So hard to deny, so hard to forget

Oh, hillside boys, you call my name
You make my heart sparkle like champagne
(Oh me, oh my)
You bring my love, my shame
Yeah, hillside boys, you call my name
Yeah, you call my name
Oh, you call my name
Yeah, you call my name
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Why do I try
When in your eyes, I just melt again
And you'd only stay until I tell as much
Oh, it's over
In your, in your range rover
And I don't, don't know why I want you
But you look so pretty
When you're breaking me (down)

Hillside boys, you call my name
You make my heart sparkle like champagne
(Oh me, oh my)
You bring my love, my shame
Yeah, hillside boys, you call my name (name)
Yeah, you call my name
Oh, you call my name (my name)
Yeah, you call my name
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Paco Rabanne, A million
Eau de parfum, on your sweater
I'll carry on, summer is done (done) and so are we

Hillside boys, you call my name
You make my heart sparkle like champagne
(Oh me, oh my)
You bring my love, my shame
Yeah, hillside boys, you call (yeah you call) my name (my name)
Yeah, you call my name (oh you call)
Oh, you call my name (my name)
Yeah, you call my name
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
