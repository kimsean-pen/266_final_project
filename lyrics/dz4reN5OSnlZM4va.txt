Life's been sucked out of me
And this routine's killing me
I did it to myself
Again I said this would not be

Somebody put me out of my misery
Expression, stimulation
Hollow sense of myself
I did it to myself again

Somebody put me in my place
Never enough, Never enough
Do I deserve what I got?
Now everything's okay

There's nothing wrong with me
This seems unnatural
To me I'd say in every way

Somebody kick me in the face
Now something's wrong with me
I'm bleeding profusely
And this seems natural

To me I fuck up everyday

Somebody put me in my place
Never enough, Never enough
Do I deserve what I got?
Never enough, Never enough

Do I deserve what I got?
What I got, what I got
What I got, what I got
I feel as if I'm running

Back to where I started
You ask what's wrong with me
And I say nothing
Is everything okay?

Is something wrong with me?
Pushing and pulling feelings
Eternal my heart is yours
I feel as if I'm running
I feel as if I'm running
I feel as if I'm running
RUN!
Life will knock me down!
Never enough, Never enough
Do I deserve what I got?
Never enough, Never enough
Life will knock me down!
