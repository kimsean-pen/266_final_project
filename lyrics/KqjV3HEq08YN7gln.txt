I know my signs, I know my chemistry
I know that things can be pulled together right out the blue
Right out the blue
I play it cool when I see you look at me
I'm pretty confident
We both know what it is between us two
Between me and you
So won't you say it?

You might just be too nervous
You feel like trust is worst than
Just being alone
We all get insecure, it's true, it's cool
Cause I feel like you do
I feel like you do
Just like you do

Do me a favor, and do it for yourself
Don't you be holding back, don't you know holding back's impossible
When something feels as natural, yeah
And I ain't got time to be sitting 'round here
And just waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting
You know that I hate it, but it'll feel good once you say it

You might just be too nervous
You feel like trust is worst than
Just being alone
We all get insecure, it's true, it's cool
Cause I feel like you do
I feel like you do (I feel like you do, I feel like you do)
Just like you do

Oh, oh, I feel like you do
Oh, oh, I'm feeling it too
Oh, oh, I feel like you do
Oh, oh, I'm feeling it too

You might just be too nervous
You feel like trust is, worst than
Just being alone
We all get insecure, it's true, it's cool
Cause I feel like you do
I feel like you do (I feel like you do, I feel like you do)
Just like you do
I feel like you do
Just like you (you do, you do, you do,
you do, you do, you do, you do, you do)
