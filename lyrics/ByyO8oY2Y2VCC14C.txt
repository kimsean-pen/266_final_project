URR...
The Rain I fear
Kills again we
Sacrificed
The ways of time
There is a ghostly morgue
Painted the day
A haunting cast of moon
I got us flowers for my second doom

I fear white ghosts like me
In the tiding's October
I paint myself like
All sky
Die

Into the blue
Someone has to die
I'm already dead
Deep
In October

Aaaaaaahhhhhhh

Fear all those nights of pain
My soul, is it dying
Break my wings (or Drink my wieners?)
I've lost it all

Into the blue
Someone has to die
I'm already dead
Deep
In October

GUUUUU
UHH

Fear all those nights of pain
My soul, is it dying
Break my wings
I've lost it all
