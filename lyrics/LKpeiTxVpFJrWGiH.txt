Baby
Baby

I've been staring down your way
Don't know exactly what to say
I'm wondering if you feel the same

Because every time I'm looking down
The questions what you're dancing around
I'm sick of playing silly games

Tell me, am I the type you go for?
Am I just wasting my time?
Should I carry on? Or should I say no more?
All of the things running through my mind

Oh tell me, tell me baby Baby
Baby

Every single night and day
I wonder if it's just a phase
Or is it really something here? (Something here)
'Cause whenever that you're near to me
I feel it in my energy
Just put me out my misery

Tell me, am I the type you go for?
Am I just wasting my time?
Should I carry on? Or should I say no more?
All of the things running through my mind

Oh tell me, tell me baby Baby
