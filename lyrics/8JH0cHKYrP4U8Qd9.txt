I've been alone
Surrounded by darkness
I've seen how heartless
The world can be
I've seen you crying
You felt like it's hopeless
I'll always do my best
To make you see
Baby, you're not alone
'Cause you're here with me
And nothing's ever gonna bring us down
'Cause nothing can keep me from lovin' you
And you know it's true
It don't matter what'll come to be
Our love is all we need to make it through...
Now I know it ain't easy
But it ain't hard trying
Everytime I see you smiling
And I feel you so close to me...
And you tell me:
Baby, you're not alone
'Cause you're here with me
And nothing's ever gonna bring us down
'Cause nothing can keep me from lovin' you
And you know it's true
It don't matter what'll come to be
Our love is all we need to make it through...
I still have trouble
I trip and stumble
Trying to make sense of things sometimes...
I look for reasons
But I don't need 'em
All I need is to look in your eyes
And I realize...
Baby, I'm not alone
'Cause you're here with me
And nothing's ever gonna take us down
'Cause nothing can keep me from lovin' you
And you know it's true
It don't matter what'll come to be
Our love is all we need to make it through...
Oh, 'cause you're here with me
And nothing's ever gonna bring us down
Cause nothing, nothing, nothing
Can keep me from lovin' you
And you know it's true
It don't matter what'll come to be
You know our love is all we need
Our love is all we need
To make it through...
