(Ooh)
Don't pick it up you
(Ooh)

I saw a little kid as
He walked around
He picked a candy bar up
Off the ground
He chowed about a half and
His face turned blue
Turned out that candy bar was
A doggy doo

Woh, don't pick it up I say
Woh, unless you can throw it away
(Ooh)
Woh, don't pick it up I say
(Ooh)
You're gonna be bummed that you went that way

You're out there makin' bacon
No scrutiny
You mess around too much and
You got VD
You know you never think and
Sore today
You're gonna take it back to California

Woh, don't pick it up I say
Woh, unless you can throw it away
(Ooh)
Woh, don't pick it up I say
(Ooh)
You're gonna be bummed that you went that way

Don't
(Pick it up)
Don't
(Pick it up)
Don't
(Pick it up)
Don't

(So)
My friend was kinda hurtin'
A girl to try
He saw one that looked like Pat on
Saturday Night Live
It had a pair of thingies
A mustache too
Not clearly male or female
So what to do?

Woh, don't pick it up I say
Woh, unless you can throw it away
(Ooh)
Woh, don't pick it up I say
(Ooh)
You're gonna be bummed that you went that way
