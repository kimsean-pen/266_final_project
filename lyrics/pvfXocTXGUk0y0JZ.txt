If I gotta ride like you want
eating up whatever you got
Keep my lies up, you know
oh you force it all, oh you need it all

Trying to keep a face up tonight
even though the guy's got you right
Coming off the wrong side, you know
oh you force it all

You start it right, You tread so light
You tease this love, You care enough

You can rearrange me now
if we wait we can make it somehow
Well what you want, what you want
anything you want
