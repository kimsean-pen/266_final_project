Oh, oh
The barkeep's in a bad mood
Playing with his chains
Talking 'bout a blood moon
Asking how I found this place
My eyes are drained
From the one that got away
So tonight I'm going out
Tonight I'm gonna stay out
In walks Lady Long Boots
Looking for a date
I would make the first move
But I'm too drunk to enunciate

Never been one to wanna hear about someone's day
So tonight I'm going out
Tonight I'm gonna stay out
& it's so hard just to be
There's such a fine line between the things you want & the
& the things that you need
So I'm not going to sleep
I'm slippin' into midnight
Under harsh light
& nothing gets me down

Running into old friends I don't need anymore

Tonight I'm gonna show 'em we all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars, so what?
I'm slippin' into midnight

Under harsh light
& nothing here is bringing me down

Oh, oh
& nothing here is bringing me down
Oh, oh
& my heart is always breaking for the ghosts that haunt this room
We fall asleep to revolution

But wake up next to a sad excuse
Oh, what a shame

How we got in our way

So tonight I'm going out
Tonight I'm gonna stay out

& it's so hard not to scream
There's such a fine line between the things you are & the
& the things that you've been, whoa

Slippin' into midnight
Under harsh light
& nothing gets me down
Up above the past loves I don't need anymore
Tonight I'm gonna show 'em we all got scars

We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars, so what?
I'm slippin' into midnight
Under harsh light

& nothing here is bringing me down

Got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
I'm scared that I'm becoming a satellite
On the sadder side of the moon
Convinced that if you'd ever stood by my side

Now you're on the other side of the room
But I get this funny feeling that tonight is gonna be
Much better than it's been, ooh
I thought that I could keep my eyes open
& let the light shine in, ooh
& it's so hard just to be
There's such a fine line
There's such a fine line
Such a fine line
But I'm not sleeping tonight
Slippin' into midnight
Under the harsh light
& nothing gets me down
Running into old friends I don't need anymore
Tonight I'm gonna show 'em we all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars, so what?
I'm slippin' into midnight
Under harsh light
& nothing here is bringing me down
Nothing here is bringing me down
& nothing here is bringing me down
