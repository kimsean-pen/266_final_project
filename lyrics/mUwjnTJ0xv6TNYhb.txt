No time to hide
I'm alive on the inside
Breaking up my mind on the front lines
When I survive, when I survive another day
This great divide
Side by side on the inside
Breaking up our minds on the front lines
Never again, never again will I be denied
Here I come

'Cause here I come

I've waited all my life to get out of the trenches
I'm ready to fight for what I believe you can steal from me
I won't take this
Gonna fill these trenches and stand up

Wake up, I won't give up
'Cause here I come, here I come

Back and forth, stuck in a hole, damage control
Digging for rhymes on a secondhand cell phone
When I survive, when I survive another year
Still month to month
Paying my dues on the inside
Breaking up my mind on the outside
Never again, never again will I be denied
Here I come

'Cause here I come

I've waited all my life to get out of the trenches
I'm ready to fight for what I believe you can steal from me
I won't take this
Gonna fill these trenches and stand up

Wake up, I won't give up
'Cause here I come, here I come

I've waited all my life to get out of the trenches
I'm ready to fight for what I believe you can steal from me
I won't take this
Gonna fill these trenches and stand up

Wake up, I won't give up
'Cause here I come, here I come

Stand up
Wake up
I won't give up
'Cause here I come, here I come
