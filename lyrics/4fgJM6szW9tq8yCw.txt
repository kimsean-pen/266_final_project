Hey Stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we would talk
And I didn't say half the things I wanted to

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen
Boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Hey Stephen
I've been holding back this feeling
So I've got some things to say to you
(Ha)
I've seen it all, so I thought
That I'd never seen nobody shine the way you do

The way you walk
Way you talk
Way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful
Don't you ever change
Hey Stephen
Why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights
You're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now
So come on and come out
And pull me near
And shine, shine, shine

Hey Stephen
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls
Well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?
(Ha ha)

I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself
(Myself)
(Can't help myself, I can't help myself)
(Oh, oh, oh)
