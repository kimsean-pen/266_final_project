Keep waking up in the freezing cold
Of your mother's tears coming through the walls
That same old feeling spinning 'round your head
Your daddy's leaving town again

And you can hear your baby sister scream
Your innocence get up and leave
It's that same old feeling spinning 'round your veins
Your daddy's leaving town again

And again, and again

And I blame myself for [?]
And I blame myself for [?]
And I blame myself, yeah it's true
Oh, for you

Keep waking on the bedroom floor
Seeing shadows underneath your door
It's that same old feeling spinning 'round your head
When your daddy's leaving town again
And again and again

And I blame myself for [?]
And I blame myself for [?]
Oh I blame myself, so it's true
Oh, for you
