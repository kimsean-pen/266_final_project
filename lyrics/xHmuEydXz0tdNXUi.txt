A frozen heart beat under the snow
I've been waiting, ready to grow
Shivering and weathering storms
Dreaming of some other place warm

While my roots dig deeper inside
And my leaves stay bundled up tight
I felt my face get bigger than life
Not only did I survive...

I learned to blossom
Finding sunlight in the grey
Knowing I will be okay
I learned to blossom
Finding sunlight in the grey
Flowing lifeline with no rain
I blossom

Winter's voice is ghostly in the wind
Whispering "this could be the end"
Why are they forgetting me not?
Can't they see I'm hurting enough?

While my roots dig deeper inside
And my leaves stay bundled up tight
I felt my face get bigger than life
Not only did I survive...

I learned to blossom
Finding sunlight in the grey
Knowing I will be okay
I learned to blossom
Finding sunlight in the grey
Flowing lifeline with no rain
I blossom

And I would
And I would
And I Could
