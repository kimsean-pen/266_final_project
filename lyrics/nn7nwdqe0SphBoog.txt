hold on tight she wears the seek
it's got more stars than the sky
it's still forbidden to excuse
that little look in your eye
i was busted in my gut that time
that time i said "i know it's true"
why didn't i ask? why didn't i ask?
why didn't i ask? why didn't i?

i can't believe she's married to roe
i would have turned down the light
but she always marked my fear
doesn't make it alright
i wanted to stay there
but you know i needed more than that
why didn't i ask? why didn't i ask?
why didn't i ask? why didn't i?

why didn't i ask? why didn't i ask?
why didn't i ask? why didn't i ask?
why didn't i ask? why didn't i ask?
why didn't i ask? why didn't i ask?
