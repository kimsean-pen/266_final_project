What do you call yourself, if anything?
I do not care to call myself much of anything
If I had your dollar, I'll show you what I mean
I'll show you what I mean
I'll show you what I mean
I'll show you what I mean
I'll show you what I mean

You live out in the street in the open air?
Yes, I live out in the street, nature is everywhere
If I had your dollar, I'll take you anywhere

If I really did, what would you go and buy?
None of your business, but later I'd be high
If I had your dollar, you wouldn't wonder why

If you're so hard up, why not try to steal?
Right now I'm sunbathing, perhaps later on I will
If I had your dollar, I'll show you how to feel

Are you ashamed to beg
Your youth in full power?
Power corrupts! I'm building a cinnamon tower
If I had your dollar, I'll finish in the hour

What would your mama say
Seeing you this way?
My mama is a rose, my papa is today
If I had your dollar, I'll sing your blues away

Where next will you go
When the winter comes?
Out to the open highway
But why not ask my thumbs?
If I had your dollar, I'll beat it like a drum

Does the devil ever come
A-knocking on your sleeping bag?
If he ever does, I'll offer him a drag
If I had your dollar, you'll make my doggy wag

What do you call yourself, if anything?
I do not care to call myself much of anything
If I had your dollar, I'll show you what I mean
I'll show you what I mean
I'll show you what I mean
I'll show you what I mean
I'll show you what I mean
I'll show you what I mean (Uh-huh)
I'll show you what I mean (That's right)
I'll show you what I mean
I'll show you what I mean
