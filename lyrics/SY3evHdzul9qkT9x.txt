I'm looking through you
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you
What did I know?

You don't look different
But you have changed
I'm looking through you
You're not the same

Your lips are moving
I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing
But the words aren't clear

You don't sound different
I've learned the game
I'm looking through you
You're not the same

Why? Tell me why
Did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit
Of disappearing overnight

You're thinking of me
The same old way
You were above me
But not today

The only difference
Is you're down there
I'm looking through you
And you're nowhere

Why? Tell me why
Did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit
Of disappearing overnight

I'm looking through you
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you
What did I know?

You don't look different
But you have changed
I'm looking through you
You're not the same
Yeah, oh, baby you've changed
Aah, I'm a-looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you
You've changed, you've changed
You've changed, you've changed
