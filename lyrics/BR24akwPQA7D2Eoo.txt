I can't
Seem to get a hold of this
This mess
Seems to be taking
Its grasp on every
Everything that we once worked for
And I can't bear to watch
Everything just fall around me,

And I've been struggling for so long
So long
And I've been
Looking for away
To make everything fall into place

And when the red glazes over my eyes
There's nothing anyone can say or do
Just you try and stop me
Try and stop what I've have become how I wish there was a way.

And I've been struggling for so long
So long
And I've been
Looking for away
To make everything fall into place

Everything just fall into place
Every word I ever said
Is making sense again
When the red glazes over my eyes
There's nothing anyone can say or
Say or do
And still today I cannot tell
The dream's from nightmares anymore
And still today I cannot tell
The dream's from nightmares anymore
And still today cannot tell
The dream's from nightmares anymore
If you reject the ones you love,
You'll find yourself cold and broken again
If you reject the ones you love,
You'll find yourself cold and broken again
If you reject the ones you love,
You'll find yourself cold and broken again
If you reject the ones you love,
You'll find yourself cold and broken again
