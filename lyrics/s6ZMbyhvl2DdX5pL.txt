Yeah yeah yeah
You didn't call me
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

You didn't call me (you didn't call)
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)

IAMDDB
Keep it G

You didn't call me
After I left you
Yeah yeah (oh oh oh)
Calling, calling (calling, calling)
Calling with all my heart
Yeah yeah

And that's when I realised my phone was off (my phone was off)
What the fuck (the fuck)
I'm tripping for no reason (for no reason)
Even though I know exactly what we are (what we are)
Girl it's your heart (it's your heart)
Follow her (follow her)
Follow her

I don't know if I'm makin' any sense at all
I'm just tryna find words that'll make me sound sensible
You know
And I can mumble when I want
And I still sound recognisable

I don't fade away like you hoes
I said please don't disturb my calling
There's no time (there's no time)
In my mind (in my mind)
Thinking about you all the time
In my eyes, I'm blind
In my mind (in my mind, in my mind)
Thinking about you all the time
Laaa

Get what I want
Get what I like
Get what I need
Pick what you like
Take all the storm
And becoming the storm
Give me the world
I'ma go on a tour

Give me my henessy
I'm feeling tipsy
Give me my henessy
I'm feeling lifted
Give me my you and me
I'm feeling twisted (I'm feeling twisted)

I don't know if I'm makin' any sense at all
I'm just tryna find the words that'll make me sound kinda sensible
Sound me sensible
Kinda, kinda, kinda, kinda
Laaa
