Someday, I might miss you, but I sure don't miss you right now.
I was blue as a man could be when you left me, but I sure don't miss you right now.
It took me a while to get back on my feet.
It took me a while to smile again.
I was ashamed that I could ever be so weak.
But I loved you girl, yes I did.
Hey, someday I might miss you, but I sure don't miss you right now.
I was blue as a man could be when you left me, but I sure don't miss you right now.
When you put me down I was all torn up, sure enough, crying every night.
Well now I see the light, and everything seems so new.
Finally got over you
Someday, I might miss you, but I sure don't miss you right now.
I was blue as a man could be when you left me, but I sure don't miss you right now.
Some nights I start to feel real weak.
I get so worn down I can't hardly sleep.
But I know this too shall pass, and at last, I don't miss you, baby.
Someday, I might miss you, but I sure don't miss you right now.
I was blue as a man could be when you left me, but I sure don't miss you right now.
Someday I might miss you, but I sure don't miss you right now.
I was blue as a man could be when you left me, but I sure don't miss you right now.
