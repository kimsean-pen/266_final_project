Die hard fans adored your hands
They loved your throat and quote unquote "you"
Hey, remember Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson really happened
Delta Echo Alpha Delta, walking on the moon forever

You are dead and buried, you are dead (Oh no)
That's being revised!
Even as we speak we're synthesizing blood and organs
Synthesizing heart and soul
Even Katy Perry knows you're dead (Oh no)
Won't she be surprised!
When we get your heart to start tomorrow
When you see the chart tomorrow you'll be number one

Bro, you look amazing
Really put together
It's like you haven't aged a day, oh
It's like we know what we're doing or something

You've been gone for way too long, like half a year
An entire career for some
Good luck getting into Heaven if you live past 27
Listen to the radiation put you back in circulation

You are dead and buried, you are dead (Oh no)
Oh, but you never died!
Even as we speak we're synthesizing blood and organs
Synthesizing heart and soul
Ain't no cemetary you can't shed (Oh no)
Ain't nowhere you can hide!
Don't be frightened of us
Soon enough you're gonna love us, just remember

This is your last ride ever, forever
Fill up your lungs, feel better
Look, it's you, good as new
New hands, new throat, new living tissue
You earned this new purpose
Lifetime achievement award

Don't be nervous baby
We put a billion eyes back on you
From the grave to the stage
You're a natural, babe!

You are dead and buried, you are dead (Oh no)
That's being revised!
Even as we speak we're synthesizing blood and organs
Synthesizing heart and soul
Even Katy Perry knows you're dead (Oh no)
Won't she be surprised!
When we get your heart to start tomorrow
When you see the chart tomorrow you'll be number one
(Oh no, oh no)
