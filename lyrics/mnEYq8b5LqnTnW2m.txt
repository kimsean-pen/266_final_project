Hey yo I'm new millennium I'm hyping
We go got gas
Like she was down to try it
Y'all niggas ain't got no confidence
Back to the dollar like common sense
Y'all niggas making sense of that
Want more swag you can run tell that
I'm in the outback
I'm smoking loud packs
I'm ratchet with my niggas and you know we don't know how to act
So everything I'm doing, man that's real life

Work in the day, party at night
Moms on her knees praying cause I ain't livin' right
Forty days forty nights and I'm still up
DMT in the blunt but that ain't goin' kill us
I'm prolly like my father man, I don't believe it
If my mother hate us both then why the fuck was I conceived then
The world's turning
I'm smoking still
Success won't be the end of me my death will

I'll wait forever
In the longest line
I'll give up never
Cause it's my chance to shine
I hope I made it for my turn, for my turn to die
